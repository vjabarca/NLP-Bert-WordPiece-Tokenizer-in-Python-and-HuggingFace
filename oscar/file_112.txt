Okay, I may wear all black, not be social, and only hang out with one person . . . BUT I'M NOT AN EMO DRUGGY!!!!! I'm not emo!!! I wear all black because it's comforting and simple. Unlike, Sky, who dresses in a variety of colors, I don't like attention drawn to me. In this area it's for the best. Everyone keeps telling me I should be more like her because she has all the friends and the popularity, but I don't want that. Drew is the only friend I need and we've known each other for forever. He's on the basketball team though, so does that make him a jock? Popular? If so that really tanks . . . but he says I'm his only friend, so we'll see.
ANYWAY!!! Back to today. So after everyone tested we found out that most of the football team was using steroids, and a lot of the other athletes were aswell. (Not including Drew)
10% of the freshman turned up positive, 3% of the sophmores, 13% of the juniors, and a whopping 30% showed up positive for the seniors. HA!
I know I'm posting this on Wednesday, but I couldn't get to the library computer due to certain difficulties.
So anyway, on Monday, one of the senior football jocks in our school got admitted into the hospital for overdosing on steroids and PCP. You see, that's what happens when you get to caught up on being in the 'in crowd'. He was gone all of yesterday and today, and I have not the slightest of ideas to when he will be out. The drugs took a harsh affect on his body. The rumor is that he's gonna do time in jail and rehab. How much of that is true? No idea.
All of the 2nd graders in Jeremy's school are putting on a concert for the families. It's no Lil' Wayne type thing or anything, but it's important to Jeremy, so Sky and I are going. I tried to make my parents go, but evidently they have better things *cough cough-clubbing* to do that night. I don't think Jeremy minds very much, but they should still go. I mean, what kind of parents ditch their kids to go clubbing at some cheap place in the city. All they do is drink too much and get into trouble. My parents could care less about the three of us. To her, getting preggo and having a kids was the worst thing that ever happened. We take care of ourselves and Jeremy. We use our parents money for most things, but they never do anything to help. Sky and I do all the parent work. We schedule the appointments. We get him to school. We make sure he's fed and safe in his bed at night. And when it comes to shopping, we do it all. We use money from our parents to buy food, but their salary won't pay for clothes. Sky and I work multiple jobs to pay for it all. And with the rate that Jeremy is growing, I might have to take another shift or two. I'm not complaning though. If we didn't do that stuff he would be taken away from us, and I couldn't imagine life without him. I love him to death.
Yo. I'm Lennicia Darmona. People just call me Lenna. My family a I live in New York, but I'm not telling you where because I'm not stupid. I'm a junior in highschool, along with my twin sister, Sky. We are basically raising our 7 year old brother, Jeremy, on our own because our parents want nothing to do with us.
This year Sky and I got the same english class, and the teacher made us write these letters to a highschool, somewhere in Virginia or something, telling them about our lives. They wrote back and we compared their life to ours. Basically, it just went back and forth like that. I personally loved it because my pen-pal happened to be a lot like me - dark, quiet, creepy- you get the picture. Anyway, I thought, 'hey, why stop at a letter?', and asked him about other ways to get my story out. He replied telling me about this Blogger thing, so I wanted to give it a try. Now the whole world will know what it's like to live in constant fear of the next day. From starvation, drugs, gang violence, homelessness - you never really know if you'll make it through the next day.
Talk about the final week of the high school football regular season, and ask about potential playoff pairings, with Jeff Linder, K.J. Pilcher, and Jeff Johnson.
As a connoisseur of offensive line play, I like Austin Holzer of Kennedy. Bryce Meeker of Prairie is a possible D-I college guy. Defensively, I think Daniel Vega is outstanding. Royal Silver of Washington is a junior to watch.
Obviously, Pierschbacher has gotten national attention along with Nelson of Xavier, offensively and defensively, respectively. Jesse Hynek is someone I like. For some reason, Leohr was a name I had in mind but haven't seen City High play this year.
Make sure to read JJ's story on Washington at www.iowaprepsports.com leading up to Thursday's game against Dubuque Wahlert
Be hard to turn them down, but a lot can happen in a year. Never know who will be around next year anymore.
I saw the article of that Royal Silver kid who plays noseguard for cedar rapids Washington. Do you guys think he has the talent to go D1
One right, Seth. Back then West was in the midst of a 36-game losing streak. Didn't play City High, because it was the first season for a 14-team MVC and were in opposite divisions and not part of the crossovers. CRJ, CRK and LM
That is a good question, Mike. My guess is they are strong based on the collective unit. Not to mention, they have had a couple UNI players, and technically that is D-I. I know what you mean though, Mike.
I think Lisbon wins ... not sure about rolls. I don't think it gets to a continuous clock. I'd say 2-3 TDs.
LisbonLions, I asked that (kind of) of Scott Unash earlier today. I think they will win. I won't say roll, but could. I'm not sure they beat BGM in the postseason when they cross paths.
How does CCA get into the playoffs they will finish 4-5 and are HORRIBLE... The playoff system is so weak in this state if teams with a losing record get in, teams with a losing record should not be rewarded by playing in the postseason. This is about the state getting more revenue $$$

The biggest event of Day 1 for Team Canada was women's moguls. Canada had four athletes competing in the 3-stage final. By the final stage there were two Canadians left, and they ended up on the top two steps of the podium. The youngest of the three Dufour-Lapointe sisters, Justine, took home the gold while her older sister Chloé followed right behind her to win silver.
According to our amazing researcher Paula, this is the first time that Canadian siblings have been on the same Olympic podium in the same individual event (winter or summer)!!

I passed by you, and I saw you… I spread my cloak over you and covered your nakedness (Ezekiel 16: 8)
Our hearts all hold memories of situations in which we have felt fear, coldness, and darkness. Remembering your childhood, you probably had a favorite blanket. When you covered yourself with it, you felt safe. You felt happy. You felt protected.
It was like a special kind of dress. You used it more to cover yourself, and not so much to draw the attention of others. Perhaps it was your most authentic dress, the one that made you feel the most real, or the one you needed at some specific moment in your first few years.
Wrapped in the simplicity of this blanket you felt protected against anything that could harm you. And as you read these lines, you vividly remember your blanket and the security that surrounded you in that dress.
Now, you still need a blanket that covers you, one that gives you security, one that is something personal, one that adapts to your needs, gives you warmth, protection and above all the certainty that with it, nothing can happen to you.
Our lives have been touched by the love of our parents and others. Thanks to them, we discovered that we are worthy of being loved. But we also have a profound intuition that these loves are reflections of a greater love.
Our limited experience of an unlimited love makes us aware of our own inner cry for an unconditional, eternal and perfect love. Although we may feel too weak or unworthy of such love, at the same time our hearts quietly scream, “love me when I least deserve it because that is when I need it the most!” This is the blanket that you need to be covered with.
God passes over your life, sees your heart, knows you, spreads his mantle over you and covers your inner nakedness to wrap you in his heart. In this way, the very weakness of your limitations makes you worthy of unlimited love. And, in all honesty, how many times do you feel weak every day?
Allow God to pass by, to show you who you are with your limitations which are precious in his eyes. Because of them, he can surround you with his merciful love and you can hear him say to you, “Do not be afraid. I am here. I will always cover and protect you.”
I will fear no evil, for you are with me, your rod and your staff comfort me (…) your goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life (Psalm 23: 4-6)
In your journal, write about the times in which you have felt the loving and unconditional presence of God most deeply, whether in events, people or experiences of prayer that have marked your life.
Past chapters of 52 Dresses: The Heart of a Woman as Seen by God are available in Spanish on my YouTube channel , and in English on the RC Live! blog.

Numerous cylinder versions have electrical power heads as conventional or increase-on equipment made up of exactly the same form of mechanical beaters as in upright units, producing them as effective on carpets as upright products. These types of beaters are driven by a independent electric powered motor or a turbine which takes advantage of the suction ability to spin the brushroll via a travel belt. Drum
The vacuum cleaner progressed from the carpet sweeper by using handbook vacuum cleaners. The 1st handbook models, making use of bellows, have been produced while in the 1860s, and the initial motorized types appeared for the turn from the 20th century, with the main ten years staying the increase decade.

The development of the national oil and gas sector is closely related to the issue of transporting extracted hydrocarbons to the foreign markets. It is rather clear as the share of oil and gas condensate makes up more than 61% of the total national export. In 2007, 60.8 million tonnes of oil were exported to the CIS countries and further abroad.
Today, there are only three HC transport routes available for Kazakhstan. The first route is oil pipelines running through the territory of Russia: the CTC and the Atyrau-Samara pipelines. The second one is trans-Caspian transport and export via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline. The third route is the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline that links Kazakhstan and China. The current capacity of these pipelines is enough to provide Kazakhstan’s export energy supply. Although the increase in crude oil production falls short of the expected figures, the main oil fields in the country, the Tengiz field and the Karachaganak field, will reach their maximum productivity in the near future. The commercial production of the Kashagan field will start in 2013 (the development of the field was delayed several times) providing the additional 500,000 barrels per day in early stages.According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, during the next seven years, the crude oil production in the country is expected to rise to 100 million tonnes. The ambitions of the officials were restrained, as previously they expected to gain 150 million tonnes of crude oil in 2015. However, if Kazakhstan implements these adjusted plans for increasing hydrocarbon extraction, the current pipeline capacity will not be sufficient. It may cause a shortfall of export routes for Kazakhstan’s raw materials in the near future. In addition, it may hinder the implementation of the state policy of diversification of HC export flows.
So, Kazakhstan needs to enlarge the capacity of the existing pipelines, as well as construct new ones. That is why Kazakhstan searches for new routes and strongly supports construction projects that provide easy delivery of Kazakhstan’s oil to international markets via export pipelines.
The main export route for Kazakhstan’s oil is still the Russian one. Thus, more than 2/3 of the total crude oil export is pumped via the Atyrau-Samara and the CTC pipelines. During the recent years, the pumping rates of these pipelines have exceeded their designed capacities. Today, they can be loaded over 100% due to the application of special antifriction additives. The negotiations on expanding the capacities of both pipelines (up to 25 million tonnes and 67 million tonnes respectively) have been conducted for a long time, however they have not been concluded yet and the final decision has not been made. Meanwhile Tengizchevroil, the main supplier of raw materials for the CTC system, plans to produce 32 million tonnes of oil in 2010 (as compared with 14 million tonnes in 2007).
The issue of expanding the CTC and the Atyrau-Samara pipelines led to new prospective routes in addition to the traditional ones used through Russian territory. Kazakhstan willingly considers the route to China, is interested in the Turkish route through Baku and Tbilisi, and negotiates on its participation in the Ukraine project of the Odessa-Brody pipeline. The government also takes into account such projects as the Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline and the Baltic Pipeline System. In particular, in the event of an acquisition of a share in the Burgas-Alexandroupoli pipeline project, Kazakhstan will have good prospects for exporting approximately 17 million tonnes of its crude oil to the South European market.
The Kazakhstan-China pipeline project implementation period was really short. In September 2004, there was an official ceremony of the construction starting, and in July 2006 there were the first commercial supplies. In 2006, the monthly average of crude oil supplied to China totalled 300,000 tonnes, in 2007 this figure made up approximately 400,000 tonnes, and this year it has reached 480,000 tonnes. According to the data as of the beginning of August 2008, the total volume of crude oil exported to China via this pipeline exceeded 10 million tonnes. At the end of 2009, the Kenkiyak-Kumkol section will be put in operation and will allow for doubling the pipeline capacity in future.
Another prospective route is the BTC pipeline. From the very beginning of its construction it was clear that Azerbaijanian’s oil would not be enough to provide the full load capacity (according to the most optimistic forecasts, by 2010, the production of the Azerbaijan International Operating Company will only be 45 million tonnes). Obviously, the design of the BTC pipeline was counted on the Kazakh oil, but for a long time Kazakhstan did not participate in this project – the issue of Kazakhstan’s participation in this project was not settled until the last moment. It was not until April 2008 that the Parliament of Kazakhstan ratified the Treaty between the Republic of Kazakhstan and the Republic of Azerbaijan on support and assistance of oil export from the Republic of Kazakhstan via the Caspian Sea and the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan to international markets by means of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan system.
This treaty (with such a notable title) contemplates the construction of a new system to transport Kazakhstan’s oil across the Caspian Sea from the Aktau Port to Baku. The Yeskene-Kuryk oil pipeline (740 km long) and an oil export terminal will be built in 2010-2011; oil tankers of different deadweight will deliver crude oil to Azerbaijanian’s ports. It is planned that during the initial production stages at the Kashagan field, Kazakhstan may supply 25 million tonnes of oil to BTC pipeline, with further increase in productivity reaching up to 38 million tonnes per year.
Usually, the HC export is closely connected with political situation in transit countries. On 4 September 2008, at the 3rd KazEnergy Eurasian Energy Forum in Astana, Karim Masimov, the Kazakhstan Prime Minister, said: “Kazakhstan will continue to implement the strategy of diversification of export energy routes… taking into account their safety.” Highlighting the last issue was anticipated. Safety and stability in transit countries are the major criteria for investors, as well as for suppliers.
The explosion at the Turkish sector of the BTC pipeline and the armed conflict between Georgia and South Ossetia, showed the sensitivity of this export route. Particularly, Azerbaijan had to decrease the oil production rate and look for alternative routes of crude oil transportation. Finally, Azerbaijanian’s oil was switched to the Baku-Novorossisk pipeline. In addition, Iran decided to build the Neka-Jask pipeline, an alternative route to the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. Karim Masimov had to suspend the oil export through the Georgian territory and reorient Kazakhstan’s oil flow (that is 1 million tonnes per year) from the Batumi oil export terminal to the local market in Kazakhstan.
The global circumstances of the small and short war will surely be more substantial than its scale. Europe is in doubt about Georgia as a power supply partner, and is starting to look for a new alternate route. The lack of stability at the Caucasus may change the oil transfer routes for the Kashagan field and other shelf projects, despite the fact that four companies carrying out explorations within this region own 15% of the BTC system. By the beginning of the Kashagan field development, the construction of the last section of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline will be completed, as well as the construction of an oil pipeline between the Kashagan field and a new oil export terminal at the Caspian Sea. That will provide the availability of oil from the Kashagan field to China and Iran. Implementing the projects of the CTC and the Atyrau-Samara pipelines extension is also not to the benefit of the BTC.
It is well-known that oil fields in Kazakhstan have a high gas to oil ratio, so the issue of increasing of oil production will be considered, taking into account the issue of associated gas utilisation. In 2007, the national oil production totalled 29.6 billion cu m, but according to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, in 2010 this figure will make up 42 billion cu m, and in 2015 – 62 billion cu m. However, such trends cannot solve the problem of gas supply for the Kazakhstan population. First of all, Kazakhstan’s oil and gas sector extracts mainly associated gas to be processed at gas processing plants. Today, there are three gas processing plants in the country with the total capacity of 12.3 billion cu m of gas per year that cannot satisfy the demands. Secondly, marketable gas is required to be delivered to customers, but the main gas pipeline network consists of transit gas main pipelines, running through the territories of eight oblasts in Kazakhstan. The most important of these are the Central Asia-Centre gas pipeline, the Bukhara-Ural gas pipeline, and the Orenburg-Novopskov gas pipeline, with a total transit capacity of 100 billion cu m of gas per year.
As a result, the northern oblasts of Kazakhstan are supplied by Russian gas, while the gas supply of the southern region, which usually suffers from lack of gas in autumn and winter times, is provided by Uzbekistan. Today, to decrease external dependency, the project of the Beineu-Bozoi-Akbulak main gas pipeline is developed within the pipeline construction project between Turkmenia and China. According to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, “that will provide easy gas supply from the west regions of the country to the south ones, with further access to the east boundary of Kazakhstan. The initial pipeline capacity will be 5 billion cu m of gas”. This gas pipeline will be constructed based on the principles of state and private partnership: 50% of the total expenditures will be covered by the state budget, and another 50% will be provided by a strategic investor, chosen by tender.
The substitution of an imported gas with a domestic one will certainly raise a level of energy security and will decrease gas rates for the population of southern Kazakhstan. In future, the new gas pipeline will be used for exporting Kazakhstan’s gas to China. The designed gas pipeline capacity is 30 billion cu m of gas per year. In 2009, it is planned to complete the construction and put into operation the first stage of the pipeline, with the capacity of 10 billion cu m of gas. In 2012, after commissioning the second stage, it will be up and running at full capacity.
There are several other gas pipeline projects. In particular, KazTransGas, the national gas supply operator, sharply increased its investment. It plans to invest more than $8bn to the implementation of the three construction projects: the West-South gas pipeline, the gas pipeline to China and the Caspian gas pipeline.
In September, during the Russian Prime Minister’s visit to Tashkent, it was shown that Russia was willing to develop the project of constructing a new train with a capacity of 26–30 billion cu m of gas along the reconstructed Central Asia-Centre system. The capacity will be increased from 54.8 billion cu m of gas to 100 billion cu m of gas per year.
In addition, the European Union tries to win Kazakhstan over to the Nabucco gas pipeline project. This trans-Caspian pipe, 3,300 km long, will be laid at the bottom of the Caspian Sea and will join to the Nabucco through the following route: Central Asia–Turkey–Bulgaria–Romania–Austria.
Thus, the role of Kazakhstan in the international transit of gas is steady growing. But it is not clear if the Central Asian producers provide the adequate amount of gas for each of new gas pipelines. The capacity of the above pipelines is designed in the view of probable gas reserves subject to be recovered.
Kazakhstan’s hydrocarbons are not only the energy sources, but also a factor of geopolitical influence on neighbouring countries. Each participant of these non-linear relations has its own interest. China is interested in the provision of its growing economy with hydrocarbons, Russia is interested in oil and gas transit through its territory, and, conversely, the European countries are interested in alternative routes that exclude the Russian territory. Kazakhstan has its own interests. For example, cooperation with China will allow for greater independence from European counties in terms of investment, as well as from the Russian monopoly on raw material transit to international markets.
Obviously, the major issue for Kazakhstan today, and also for other Caspian counties, is to sharply increase the production of energy resources. But according to experts, the current plans for transporting energy resources from the Caspian region are in advance, compared to the productive capacity of the region. It is quite likely that the hydrocarbon production can be behind the scheduled dates for the commissioning of the new oil and gas pipelines. This may occur due to dry wells at rather prospective fields, or because of several delays in the Kashagan field development. So the production forecast is subject to adjustment in terms of a reduction of the production rate and the respective circumstances for the designed pipelines. There is one more aspect; while the political, economic and financial problems of the project are settled, the project costs are continuously growing. The illustrative examples are the Kashagan project and the Nabucco transport route.

The Chilean Metal scene is mostly known for producing vast amounts of Death Metal but like in every other country there's not just one sub-genre of Heavy Metal being played. Inquisicion, formed in 1993, plays Heavy Metal of the highest caliber. It is straightforward and sharp Heavy Metal that often brings to mind heroes like Accept and pre-Screaming for Vengeance Judas Priest and at times crosses the border into Power Metal quite a bit (like the song "In Grace"). Codex Gigas, the band's fifth studio album, is proof of the band's skill in their genre. A combination of catchy compositions and clear yet crunchy production is a ticket to success. Vocalist Paul Domic gets extra credit for his ear-pleasing voice that has everything a great Metal vocalist needs. Manolo Schaefler is rather amazing with his 6-string axe churning out sharp striking riffs one after another. He has definitely listened to a lot of Priest and Accept plus he has produced this album himself. This no doubt explains the slight dominance of the guitar on the record.
Codex Gigas is a pleasing, well-done Heavy Metal record. I will be seeking out Inquisicion's back catalog as well.

Toilets are not western style, where you can sit if needed (confession: I never sit in public toilets). They are at ground level. See for instance picture
Also, papers cannot be thrown to the WC, they have to be put on the paper bin. This makes the smell of the WC a bit unbearable…
Some babies and toddlers wear Kaidangku, which are trousers that are open at the back, as you can see in image below. This allows them to freely pee/poo whenever necessary. This is something that shocks the first time you see it. However it is an old costume and it seems they are only seen in rural areas.
Flavours of some food, particularly soy oil, are very strong. Some smells get into your nostrils and may make you feel sick.
In Beijing there is a street where you can buy and eat insects such as silk cocoons, cockroaches, scorpions, sea horses, etc.
Green pepper is sometimes hot. Really, be careful! in the same dish there may be slices which are normal and other slices which are really really really hot. It will make you swear and sweat 😉
Chinese airports have drinking fountains with hot and warm water, the hot is for them to make tea, or instant noodles while waiting for your flight…

“Kasimotos” is how our Chinese guide (Chuan) call those motos which are electrical and make no noise. In order to save battery, they drive by night without lights, sooo…be careful when crossing streets, as you won’t hear them coming.
In some places the pedestrian pass are not respected, so you can pass it with cars and motos around you. It is better if you go slow, no need to run, they will avoid you better as they know much better your time of reaction when you walk than when you run.
Chinese people are the main tourists in China. It is such a big country that their main tourist visitors are themselves. Also Korean and Japanese but you won’t be able to differentiate them.
Chinese people from rural places visiting the big cities may want to take pictures with you if you are different (tall, red hair…), so smile and say cheeeese 😉
Cheese… believe or not, it was hard to find cheese in China. We went to a Carrefour nearby our hotel and the only cheese we found were processed cheese slices (tranchetes in Spanish)
Compared to what happens in our stores, the youghourt section is really small. There are not much variety.

Concatenative languages like Forth have been around for a long time. Hewlett-Packard famously employed a stack-based language called “RPL” on their HP-28 and HP-48 calculators, bringing the concept of Reverse Polish Notation to the mainstream…or as close to the mainstream as a really geeky toy can get. Surprisingly though, these languages have not seen serious adoption beyond the experimental and embedded device realms. And by “adoption”, I mean real programmers writing real code, not this whole interpreted bytecode nonsense.
This is a shame, because stack-based languages have a remarkable number of things to teach us. Their superficial distinction from conventional programming languages very quickly gives way to a deep connection, particularly with functional languages. However, if we dig even deeper, we find that this similarity has its limits. There are some truly profound nuggets of truth waiting to be uncovered within these murky depths. Shall we?
Trivial aside: I’m going to use the terms “concatenative” and “stack-based” interchangeably through the article. While these are most definitely related concepts, they are not exactly synonyms. Bear that in mind if you read anything more in-depth on the subject.
Before we look at some of those “deeper truths of which I speak, it might be helpful to at least understand the fundamentals of stack-based programming. From Wikipedia:
The concatenative or stack-based programming languages are ones in which the concatenation of two pieces of code expresses the composition of the functions they express. These languages use a stack to store the arguments and return values of operations.
Stack-based programming languages all share a common element: an operand stack. Consider the following program:
Yes, this is a real program. You can copy this code and run/compile it unmodified using most stack-based languages. However, for reasons which will become clear later in this series, I will be using Cat for most of my examples. Joy and Factor would both work well for the first two parts, but for part three we’re going to need some rather unique features.
Returning to our example: all this will do is take the numeric value of 2 and push it onto the operand stack. Since there are no further words, the program will exit. If we want, we can try something a little more interesting:
This program first pushes 2 onto the stack, then 3, and finally it pops the top two values off of the stack, adds them together and pushes the result. Thus, when this program exits, the stack will only contain 5.
We can mix and match these operations until we’re blue in the face, but it’s still not a terribly interesting language. What we really need is some sort of flow control. To do that, we need to understand quotations. Consider the following Scala program:
Notice how rather than directly adding 2 and 3, we first create a closure/lambda which encapsulates the operation. We then invoke this closure, passing 2 and 3 as arguments. We can emulate these exact semantics in Cat:
The first line pushes 2 and 3 onto the stack. The second line uses square brackets to define a quotation, which is Cat’s version of a lambda. Note that it isn’t really a closure since there are no variables to enclose. Joy and Factor also share this construct. Within the quotation we have a single word: +. The important thing is the quotation itself is what is put on the stack; the + word is not immediately executed. This is exactly how we declared plus in Scala.
The final line invokes the apply word. When this executes, it pops one value off the stack (which must be a quotation). It then executes this quotation, giving it access to the current stack. Since the quotation on the head of the stack consists of a single word, +, executing it will result in the next two elements being popped off (2 and 3) and the result (5) being pushed on. Exactly the same result as the earlier example and the exact same semantics as the Scala example, but a lot more concise.
Cat also provides a number of primitive operations which perform their dirty work directly on the stack. These operations are what make it possible to reasonably perform tasks without variables. The most important operations are as follows:
swap — exchanges the top two elements on the stack. Thus, 2 3 swap results in a stack of “3 2” in that order.
dup — duplicates the first element and pushes the result onto the stack. Thus, 2 dup results in a stack of “2 2“.
dip — pops a quotation off the stack, temporarily removes the next item, executes the quotation against the remaining stack and then pushes the old head back on. Thus, 2 3 1 [ + ] dip results in a stack of “5 1“.
There are other primitives, but these are the big four. It is possible to emulate any control structure (such as if/then) just using the language shown so far. However, to do so would be pretty ugly and not very useful. Cat does provide some other operations to make life a little more interesting. Most significantly: functions and conditionals. A function is defined in the following way:
Those coming from a programming background involving variables (that would be just about all of us) would probably look at this function and feel as if something is missing. The odd part of this is there is no need to declare parameters, all operands are on the stack anyway, so there’s no need to pass anything around explicitly. This is part of why concatenative languages are so extraordinarily concise.
Conditionals also look quite weird at first glance, but under the surface they are profoundly elegant:
Naturally enough, this code pushes 0 onto the stack. The conditional for an if is just a boolean value pushed onto the stack. On top of that value, if will expect to find two quotations, one for the “then” branch and the other for the “else” branch. Since 5 is less than 10, the boolean value will be True. The if function (and it could just as easily be a function) pops the quotations off of the stack as well as the boolean. Since the value is True, it discards the second quotation and executes the first, producing 0 on the stack.
Note that this isn’t even the most concise way of writing this, but it does the job. To see how, let’s look at how this will execute word-by-word (assuming an input of 4):
You’ll notice this is a shorter post than I usually spew forth (no pun intended…this time). The reason being that I want this to be fairly easy to digest. Concatenative languages (and Cat in particular) are not all that difficult to digest. They are a slightly different way of thinking about programming, but as we will see in the next part, not so different as it would seem.
Note: Cat is written in C# and is available under the MIT License. Don’t fear the CLR though, Cat runs just fine under Mono. If you really want to experiment with no risk to yourself, a Javascript interpreter is available.
Vanilla RPN is directly equivalent to an expression tree; in fact, one can view RPN as a serialization of an expression tree. A post-order traversal of an expression tree is pretty much all that’s needed, and one does this when doing code generation for a stack machine such as the CLR or JVM.
Turning the RPN back into an expression tree requires symbolically evaluating the RPN, but capturing the full semantics of things like control flow requires a bit more intelligence, but basically not much more than the inverse of the code generation process.
And just like both JVM and CLR, and expression trees also, it’s relatively trivial to type such programs. Even though they logically use on a runtime stack, to the degree that the primitives are not polymorphic, everything is typeable statically. (E.g. if + operation must have type int -> int -> int, then you know the type of a function that looks like [ + ].)
I agree that this is pretty nifty. However, I think the mental burden is significantly heavier than with imperative or functional languages. When a programmer is writing code in such a language he cannot ignore the stack: he must be aware of its state. He does not have to manipulate the stack directly – the structure of the code will implicitly do it for him – but he must know the exact state of the stack at each point in the code. So the complexity is still there. It is in the programmer’s mind and not in the source code. I have this feeling despite the fact that I have extensive experience writing JVM programs in bytecodes.
That said, I need to admit that it can still be a matter of education. Maybe if Cat were the first language that I learned, then I would see things differently.
Not sure about your ‘interpreted bytecode nonsense’ comment about JVM. I hope you were being sarcastic.
An interesting book (although quite old) on Stack Machines and their languages can be found online at:
Of course the bytecode nonsense was sarcasm. More importantly, I was trying to differentiate between commonly used high-level languages and rarely used low-levels. Bytecode is an awesome stack oriented language, but it is rarely written by hand. At least, hardly at all in proportion to the amount of auto-generation which takes place. Also, it’s filled with a number of low-level operations more reminiscent of assembly than ML.
Actually, I’ve been playing with stack-based languages for a few weeks now on-and-off, and I’ve found very much to my surprise that the stack “goes away” over time. It’s like the parentheses in Lisp. I can’t say that it’s as natural as writing code involving named variables with random access, but it’s not too bad. One thing Cat has going for it that the JVM lacks is higher-order functions (quotations). These simplify things tremendously. In fact, so much so that Cat doesn’t have separate stacks and entirely lacks any variable mechanism (unlike Forth and Factor).
Thanks for the clarification on RPN! I threw in the reference half for coolness sake, I really know absolutely nothing about the language.
With regards to your comments on typing, just wait for Part 3. It is true that conventional stack-based expressions are very easy to type: it just falls out without any effort whatsoever. The first problem is in polymorphic arguments (e.g. pop, swap, dup). That’s easily overcome by adding universal types to the stack typing, but it doesn’t solve every problem. It turns out that higher-order functions are the real issue. If you’re impatient with regards to why and how it is resolved, I suggest you play around with Cat a little bit: it is a statically typed stack-based language with full inference.
How did you highlight the Cat snippets? Does wp_syntax support Cat out of the box? I couldn’t find Cat in the list of languages.
Nope, Cat isn’t one of the supported languages. I had to write a custom GeSHi mode for it based on the language specification. I’ve had to do that a few times now, including with Scala and SML. Most of the time I just base the mode on jEdit’s highlighting, but even that editor doesn’t have a Cat mode that I know of.
I believe that programming is about trade offs. I think that almost every principle, rule, guideline, model, paradigm, you name it, has its pros and cons. Focusing on PL paradigms then one can say (forgive me for the over simplification) that FP languages are good for writing computations/algorithms but not as natural for handling I/O. Given your experience with Cat, could you highlight its weak points? (its strong points are obvious).
I think Cat’s main weak point is that some algorithms that require random-access variables can be extremely clumsy to express. It’s not terribly hard to think in terms of the stack, but that doesn’t mean that it’s the cleanest way to do things.
I’m also unsure whether or not Cat has any meaningful integration with the common object system. If not, then it is absolutely not worth looking at for any real work.
As a Scala newcomer, I was a little curious about your syntax. I would have left out the curly braces:
Running that through the interpreter seems to work fine. I’m wondering if there is any difference in meaning between the two forms. Was that just for grouping, or does it mean something very different?
Both forms work just fine. In fact, the Scala parser turns them into the same thing under the surface. I tend to prefer the curly-brace form for stylistic reasons (I think it’s more clear that a closure is involved, rather than just a normal construct). There are times that I use the ()=> form, but not many.
If you find you need to be continually aware of the stack, then, plain and simple, “You’re Doing It Wrong.” With RPN-based languages, you should never have any words which accepts more than 3 items on the stack. If you do, you almost certainly have to refactor. This aids significantly in program comprehension as a side benefit, so it’s actually GOOD that your awareness of the stack sticks out.
I’ve had the “luxury” of maintaining Forth programs with poor factoring, and it’s these kinds of programs that results in Forth’s “write-only” conception. This is absurdly false; Forth is no more write-only than Java, which I’ve also had to maintain, particularly programs with six page-long methods. You read that right — SIX PAGES LONG. I’ll take write-only Forth over a six-page method definition in Java any day.
I’ve also had the abject pleasure of maintaining (and even authoring) Forth code that follows the aforementioned guideline, along with the “one definition, one line” guideline, which resulted in a plethora of positive e-mails suggesting how readable the code was — less than HALF of the respondents were proficient in Forth (many claimed it was their first exposure to the language). So what does this tell us?
It tells me that people who b***h and moan over RPN syntax and how oh-so-hard it is to “get it”, blah blah blah, really needs to wake up and evaluate how they write their own code. Nearly always, these are the kinds of programmers who don’t give a hoot about the quality, readability, or stability of their code, because they feel that their proficiency in the language of their choice and training is such that they can do no wrong. Therefore, RPN languages are useless toys, and can’t possibly be used for grunt programming in real-world situations.
(Except that UPS and Fedex use digital signature tablets coded in Forth. Power companies use electrical switches coded in Forth. GE released a SONET switch whose OS **IS** Forth — plug in a serial console, and you’ll get the OK prompt! Half of the orbiters around Mars run on Forth. Our space shuttle’s robotic arm and flight nav computers are programmed in Forth. Etc. Etc. Etc.)
A program written well in a concatenative language will be shorter, easier to understand, and easier to reason about than a comparable program in an applicative language. Because the stack replaces the use of local variables in most cases (of Factor’s entire codebase, for example, locals were used in only 60 places, IIRC), issues concerning aliasing and update order disappear. The explicit DUPs and SWAPs and so forth make register allocation somewhat easier, since the compiler now has unequivocal knowledge of the lifetime of a register’s value. It encourages a more lucid style of programming that isn’t so math-centric (so-called “fluent” style of coding). Ironically, concatenation is simply function composition, and as such can be reasoned about in a functional manner.
While I respect other’s opinions on concatenative languages, to which they’re free to express, I can’t help but feel quite upset and even threatened when people make such absurd notions as the “difficulty” of learning such languages public. Research shows people *naturally* follow a noun-verb order when communicating with others without a common language, and one need only remember just how difficult it was for you to learn algebra during highschool to understand the “difficulty of learning” infix notations! Prior to your algebra lessons, learning about the semantics of variable substitution, the difficulties of memorizing the FOIL method and factoring, et. al., is something that concatenative notation would have TOTALLY eliminated from the get-go. I’ve seen five year olds do some mighty sophisticated arithmetic using concatenative notations, but few understand how to properly parse the quadratic formula.
So give me a break with this hard to learn stuff. It’s not hard to learn. What *IS* hard is your inability to break out of your intellectual gutter.

Have you ever been told to keep your hands up or stop reaching to grab your opponent’s kicks in sparring?
Little mistakes that you make in sparring, can end up forming into long-term habits if you don’t correct them over time. If you develop a habit of blocking kicks with your arm, you will wish you learned how to properly block kicks when your arms are numb from shins smashing into those arms.
We can all agree that dropping your hands or not blocking kicks is a bad habit, however, there are other bad habits that can easily go undetected if you don’t have someone correct you in training. One of these other habits is always reaching to grab your opponent’s kicks.
While good fighters will grab their opponent’s kicks if they miss a block, there are some fighters out there that always try to catch their opponent’s kicks.
If you develop a habit of catching your opponent’s kicks, good fighters can take advantage of those habits.
If I know that you are going to grab my leg when I kick, I will set you up for a head kick or throw a fake kick and follow it with an overhand right punch.
To help me illustrate this point better, here is a real-life example of a fighter who gets repeatedly caught by punches as he grabs his opponent’s leg.
When it comes to the ring, it is important to try to be as unpredictable as possible. If your opponent cannot anticipate your next move, it makes you a harder person to face.
If you constantly try to grab your opponent’s leg, you will leave your chin exposed and be open for your opponent to counter you.
This fight between Erhan Gungor (blue shorts) vs. Billy Williams (yellow shorts) showcases what can happen if you develop a bad habit of always grabbing your opponent’s leg.
This fight between Erhan Gungor vs. Billy Williams provides a good example of the dangers of bad habits.
In the first round, both fighters looked even and traded blows throughout. As the fighters were feeling each other out, the fight was close.
The first time Billy caught he opponent’s leg, he was able to pull off a nice sweep. This happens in the first 40 seconds of the fight and it was well executed.
Notice how Billy leans back as he catches the kick and raises his opponent’s leg, this puts him out of danger from the right punch. The only thing Billy could have done better would be to step to the side to reduce the impact of the kick. but otherwise, it is good execution.
Following the sweep, both fighters exchange a few punches and missed kicks as neither fighter could establish a good rhythm.
The next time Erhan (blue shorts) throws a right body kick, you can see Billy (yellow shorts) again going for that leg grab. However, this time it is unsuccessful and he misses it.
Luckily for Billy, his opponent throws a body kick and doesn’t take advantage of his dropped arm. This is often how fighters like Superlek are able to get a high amount of head kick knockouts.
Up until this point, the fight is an even back and forth affair. Both fighters are trading some punches and kicks, but nothing significant has landed all fight.
Billy once again reaches for his opponent’s right low kick and gets caught with a straight right on the jaw.
Notice the difference between this kick catch and the first technique. Billy is walking forward into his opponent’s punch, instead of leaning back and raising his opponent’s leg to throw him off balance like he did the first time.
After the flash knockdown, Billy should have stopped going for his opponent’s leg. He should have learned his lesson from that flash knockdown, but unfortunately, bad habits die hard.
Again, Billy grabs on a teep in close range and refuses to let go. This results in him getting dropped from multiple punches to the chin.
While the referee should have given the Billy (yellow shorts) an 8 count, he lets them fight on. After this sequence, the Billy never recovers and gets dropped by punches right after.
Before the round expires, Billy catches his opponent’s leg after a teep for the second time in a row.
Instead of letting go, Billy is determined to get another sweep. This results in him taking more punishment to the chin.
As you can see, Billy’s natural instinct to grab his opponent’s leg cost him 3 knockdowns in the first round.
Billy would get saved by the bell in the first round, but he ended up getting TKOed at the start of the second round. He was never able to fully recover from the first few knockdowns that resulted from grabbing his opponent’s leg.
If Billy didn’t get knocked down multiple times from grabbing his opponent’s leg, this fight could have played out differently.
While Billy had a few other bad habits like leaving his hands down and not tucking in his chin, catching his opponent’s kick was the habit that would lead to his loss.
If you want to have long-term success in the ring, it is important that you establish good habits and eliminate bad ones.
Good habits like keeping your hands in front of your face, properly blocking kicks with your legs, and maintaining your composure will help keep you safe in the ring.
Even though you can get away with little mistakes in sparring, the ring is less forgiving. When your opponent is swinging full power wearing 8 oz gloves, one bad habit is all it takes to lose a fight in the blink of an eye.

Consistently I have had a desire to work in the sports management industry. With gradual success I started playing for the North Shore rep team participation in the North American Roller Hockey Championships and other travel tournaments. As my desire for roller hockey grew I started contacting other rep teams both in US and worldwide. As a result I was able to team up with programs in Colorado, San Jose, San Francisco, and Philadelphia. The experience provided me with an opportunity to play for the Canadian National Roller Hockey Team and participate in the 2005 Pan American Championships in Argentina. Upon returning to Vancouver I was contacted by a program out of New Zealand and was offered a season roster spot. In 2006 I had the pleasure of playing and winning a National Championship with the Rimutaka Renegades. Starting out as an athlete I focused on football and Roller Hockey. Initially, playing minor football for the Westside Warriors program in the Vancouver Mainland Football League. Then playing for the Carson Graham Eagles in the BC High School Football League. While at Carson Graham we had the success of a Provincial Championship in 2002. Upon that success I chose to focus on Roller Hockey which I was playing fulltime in the North Shore Inline Hockey league
Since returning to Vancouver I have focused on my business career and attained my Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology from Simon Fraser University. My desire to work in the sports management industry has progressed with the creation of CKM Sports Management. In November of 2012 the company was named runner up for SFU Entrepreneur of the Year.

An increasing number of organizations in the food supply chain industry are seeking certification with the various GFSI approved certification schemes available.
The 3 most used certification schemes are The BRC (British Retail Consortium), the Food Safety System Certification FSSC 22000 and the Safe Quality Food (SQF) code. These schemes are bench marked against the same criteria and they all need to meet minimum requirements established by the GFSI.
However, because they are owned by different organizations and they vary in terms of the scope, structure, certification process, validity and the reporting and management conducted.
The SQF code has two levels of requirements: Level 2 focuses on food safety and Level 3 on food safety and quality.
The BRC standard has descriptive requirements for process and hygienic control which provide clear guidelines as to how food safety should be addressed.
FSSC 22000 provides a good framework against which an organization can develop its food safety management system, as it is not too descriptive and has the flexibility to allow the organization to choose the best way to control its own system.
The SQF code requires a combination of SQF system elements and food safety fundamentals based on product category.
The SQF code requires a stage 1 audit that could be done on or off site and a stage 2 audit on site.
For the BRC standard all NC’s root cause analysis and objective evidence must be submitted within 28 days.
FSSC 22000 requires that critical or major NC detected in stage 1 audit have to be closed during stage 2 audit, and for minor NC the action plan should be submitted.
For the SQF code major NC from stage 1 audit must be closed out before stage 2 audit and the root cause and objective evidence need to be submitted in 14 days for majors NC and in 30 days minor NC.
Only organizations that attain SQF level 3 certification can use the SQF quality mark on their products
Whichever standard an organization decides to use, being certified by a GFSI approved certification scheme will help them ensure the delivery of safe food to their consumers, increase their processes’ efficiency and provide a platform for continuous improvement of their food safety management systems.

Ansh says why would I do it? its Naman. Naman says I left her here, where did she go? Ansh says we will find her. Naman whispers to Mohana that I will handle here, you go there. Avi says I will ask security.
All are searching for Guru Maa in room. Mohana says oldie you cant hide so come out. She starts going towards closet but doesnt see her and leaves. Guru Maa is tensed. She hears Mohana leaving and comes out. Mohana comes back and says you cant play with me, remember?
Piya is searching for Guru Maa. Mohana starts to strangle Guru Maa, she is eating her life. Piya goes to Mohana’s room and opens door, she sees Mohana lying her on bed. Ansh says she here? Mohana says she must be sleep-walking and came here. Piya says I will stay with Guru Maa tonight.
In morning, family comes to garden and sees it decorated. Vedsheree says what is all this? Priest comes there and says you people are in danger, I have brought patal liquid to save you all. Vedsheree says how you found it? Flashback shows how Sushant gave it to him and asked him to use it wisely, he asks him to take care of it, Flashback ends. Priest says I had that liquid but someone stole it. Naman smirks and looks at his goons, Goon shows patal liquid with him. Naman thinks that I stole it so Ansh cant stop my wedding. Naman comes there dressed as groom, he says I thought to get married to Piya today and not be a burden on you people, Vedsheree and others are stunned, Naman says I am worried about Piya. Shekhar says we need to perpare for wedding. Naman says I have already prepared for wedding, just bring my bride. Vedsheree is reluctant and says I will bring Piya. Naman asks priest to bless him.
Saanvi thinks that Rishi can help to find more about Piya. Saanvi talks to Rishi, Rishi says Piya is getting married to Naman in this house. A maid is mopping and mistakenly kicks black stone, stone falls in Saanvi’s bag. Flashback shows how priest said that these stones are witch influenced, whoever is near it will be in witch’s hands.
PRECAP- Vedsheree says to Piya that all are waiting for you in mandap. Ansh says this is wrong. Vedsheree says Mata rani will decide if this is right or wrong. Guru Maa comes there and says Mata have already decided that Piya can be only of Ansh. Piya gets emotional hearing it.

Tryst....just the word is so romantic, and so this necklace developed as I sat and looked at these vintage pieces I had. I love these keys, and I loooove the old vintage baubles, and I had to meld them into one. I loooove neutral, calm, subtle tones, tone on tone....they invoke such feeling in me. My heart races when I think about such simple little things, things that happen and that I don't need to work at. Timeworn and familiar and comfortable. I have been trying to follow that path.

I have been super busy, and little by little I might get everything accomplished that I need to, but there is always time for journaling and scribbling.....right?
My page below was made pretty haphazardly, but that's what makes it fun! I really can't explain it any better than that!
[UPDATED 6/25/13] With the introduction of the 2013 model year Nissan LEAF, Nissan has introduced some changes to the LEAF drive modes. We suggest that you read this article first but then continue on to our most recent article on the 2013 LEAF drive modes (found here).
There seems to be some confusion among LEAF owners and potential LEAF owners about what exactly the ECO drive mode does. Let’s take a closer look.
First a brief discussion on the shifter operation. Move the mouse forward to go backward and move the mouse backward to go forward. What’s up with that? Pretty simple answer. Nissan discovered that 90% of Nissan LEAF reservationists were Toyota Prius owners. Guess what the shift pattern is on the Toyota Prius?
Nissan likely felt that it was not in their best interest to alienate 90% of their potential customers right off the bat by making them change the way that they had been shifting for years. And since the whole idea of just a forward/back mechanism is different than a traditional PRNDL automatic transmission layout, they probably figured – Let’s go with what has already been established. So that is very likely why the shift pattern is what it is.
The real question of the moment is – what is the difference between Drive mode and ECO mode? Our distance til empty meter jumps up about 10% or so, but why?
As you have noticed by now (or will if you have not driven a LEAF yet), when you place the car in Drive mode from Park, the dash display tells you that you are in D for drive. The same movement of the mouse a second time (to the left and back) places the LEAF in ECO mode. This is all the Nissan LEAF owner’s manual has to say about the LEAF’s ECO mode:
In actual practice, the ECO accelerator pedal changes its mode of operation when selected. Keep in mind that you are just moving, in effect, an electric dimmer switch with your foot. One which can be programmed. When you select the ECO mode of operation, you change the mode of the ECO pedal to be less responsive and offer greater physical resistance. This is in addition to the effect on the heater and air conditioner noted above. Nissan developed the ECO pedal in 2008 and has been using it in the United States on the small 2011 Juke crossover since its introduction in 2010. The result is an increase of fuel efficiency on the order of 5% to 10% depending on driving conditions, according to Nissan’s research.
As you can imagine, if the benefit is derived primarily from the movement of the pedal, it requires pedal movement to do its job. No pedal movement, no benefit. We put it that way for a reason. If you are driving steady state down the freeway at XX miles per hour, the LEAF doesn’t care which mode you’re in – its biggest efficiency obstacle is getting through the air. So the ECO mode is not going to really do you any good if most of your driving is commuting on the freeway. If, on the other hand, you run multiple errands around town or are stuck in rush-hour traffic with stop-and-go freeway conditions, the ECO Pedal will do its thing and remind you to press more slowly on the accelerator to preserve electrons (or gasoline in the Juke).
This caused an acquaintance to ask about acceleration and responsiveness when in the ECO mode. As the design of the pedal is to influence behavior, it will by definition provide less responsiveness whether on the freeway or around town. But Nissan has a very strong safety orientation, and has for some time. We’ll put up another post about that in a couple of days. So, even when in ECO mode, when the accelerator pedal is floored, full power is provided. Safety trumps economy. If you are requesting full power, you must need it for a reason. “All ahead warp speed Mr. Scott!”
steve – absolutely right. Thanks for that addition. Personally, I would like to see even more regen capability offered. Perhaps not as severe as that offered on the Mini E, but regen, even in ECO mode, is still fairly mild with the LEAF.
Thanks Ernie for your explanation of the difference of the “ECO” drive position and the “D” drive position.As a recent owner of a LEAF I wondered how they achieved the ECO. So the accelerator pedal is basically a reostat or potentiometer to reduce the rate at which the Battery power is being consumed. No2 you are right , I was a prius owner for six years and I must say that it is a fabouless piece of engineering. The problem with the prius and indeed the LEAF is that very few of the dealers know much about them. It impossable to get a list of the checks that should be done when being serviced. This is my experience. David
David – Welcome to Living LEAF. You’re right – the accelerator is a potentiometer. But for many the idea of a dimmer switch is easier to grasp. I like to go with easy to understand descriptions when possible. Thanks for providing your input. The more contributors that we have, the more useful this site becomes.
Ernie,I would like to get a list of the checks that need to be done on the leaf , say for a 30 k mile check or service. Can you recomend a site where this info is available.David
Hi David. Your best source for maintenance info on the LEAF (or any car) is the manufacturer. The LEAF has two maintenance schedules, per the maintenance manual which you received with your owner’s manual – Schedule 1 (more severe operating conditions) and Schedule 2 (less severe). Most owners will operate their vehicles in less severe conditions, so the Schedule 2 (and Schedule 1 in this case) service requirements are fine. At 30 months (not mileage based) Nissan recommends changing the brake fluid, replacing the in-cabin filter (to filter pollen, dust, etc for passengers), and rotating the tires. In addition, several inspections are performed. All Nissan manuals are available online, which I have linked to above. Hope that helps!
pete.d – Welcome to Living LEAF. Thanks for the kind words, and for the reminder to update the article. I will add something to the bottom of this article, and may write a new one about the drive modes.
Thanks Ernie but as a senior I am still not sure when to use D,B or Eco. I have been driving about 90% on eco but I like the feel of D better. I do this on the freeway and about town. Every dealer says something different. Some say don’t use eco on the freeway and others say the opposite. Also is there a difference between B and eco?
Mark – Welcome to Living LEAF. When I wrote this article, it pertained to the 2011-2012 LEAF. The 2013 has the B mode, as you indicated. Look for an article in the near future that discusses the specifics of this system. Thanks for the question.
We just purchased a 2013 Nissan Leaf S. The steering wheel does not have the ECO button. When D mode is selected the first time, ECO mode lights up on the display, when shifting a second time, the ECO mode on the display goes away. I am therefore assuming that ECO mode for this model is the default and shifting into D a second time actually selects the more agressive mode. Never assumed that something so easy could lead to so much confussion. Nissan needs to do better when putting their manuals together and include information for all models.
Jim – Welcome to Living LEAF. I have not driven a 2013 LEAF S model, but I was under the impression that the drive mode selection was the same as that on the 2011 and 2012 models. The first time that the controller is moved to the left and back the D mode is selected. The second time that the controller is moved to the left and back the ECO mode is selected. Based on your description they have reversed this for the 2013 Model S. No matter – when the ECO mode indicator light is lit up, the accelerator requires a greater effort to provide acceleration. Also, climate control functionality is optimized for range. The important part is your understanding of the operation when either mode is selected. Also, please remember, in the ECO mode full throttle application will still result in maximum power. I hope that you enjoy your LEAF.
I have a 2012 and the default mode is D with the eco mode being chosen by the driver at any time even while moving. One point others may not be aware of is when parking the car just stop, set the manual brake and push and let go of the start button. This eliminates one extra action of pushing the park button itself and the parking pawl will be set by the start/ shutdown button.
I would like to know if the 2012 year could be programmed for maximum regen as is now appearing on the latest Leaf.
I am presently using a new Leaf courtesy car and like the strong regen, virtually allowing one pedal driving.
Great info! Thanks for the article. I do believe that almost all car companies use the same shifting pattern though. It would be unfair to attribute Nissan’s design to trying to be prius like. Have you ever seen an automatic transmittion that you pushed away from you to engage the drive gear? Even in the sequntial gear boxes that many race cars use it is always pull to shift up and push to shift down. Just thought I’d give my .002.
Thank you for this info. I just purchased a used LEAF and am diving into all the new knowledge I need! I am trying to figure out how to shift into ECO mode, although most of my driving is a 15-mile commute on a 55 mph highway. I appreciate this website!
Dana – Welcome to Living LEAF. On the 2012 and 2011 models, you enter ECO mode the same way you put the car into drive, once in drive you move the gear selector to the left and back again. This will act as a toggle switch between ECO and Drive every time you perform that movement. On the later models, this will toggle between Drive and Battery or B-Mode, which is an enhanced version of regeneration on those models. Those later models have an ECO selector button on the steering wheel.
I just purchased a 2012 Leaf and am struggling with its range already. I have a 30 mile commute and my Leaf says it has at most 68mile rangewhen fully charged. But I am scraping empty just going from my house to work and need a full charge to get back home. Half the time I can’t run the heater to stay warm or help defog the windows. I am wondering what am I doing wrong? Do I just have unrealistic expectations? Any advice would be helpful.
Hi Chris – Welcome to Living LEAF. Without knowing more about your situation it is difficult for me to provide an analysis. Based on your heater comment, my guess it that you live in a cold environment. Cold temperatures reduce the driving range. The good news is that the range will increase in warmer weather. If you are driving over 65 miles per hour on your commute, you will reduce your driving range. If you have a significant elevation change driving to work, you will reduce your range. If your commute is mostly uphill to work, your drive home should use up very little range and you might not need a full charge to get home. The ECO drive mode will do little to improve your range in any of these conditions. It is designed to optimize range in around town use, not freeway use. You may find that by modifying your driving style your LEAF may be suitable for your needs. It could be that in your particular situation, a pre-owned LEAF will not prove capable. You should also know that you can drive about five to ten miles after the last bar disappears from the “fuel tank”. Check out my articles on how far you can go at the “bottom of the tank” (found here). Good luck.
I do have a significant hill in my commute. I have never driven an electric car before so had little idea what to expect but jumped in head first anyway. I found that setting the cruise control helped to save me some range because I wasn’t trying to drive like I was still in a gas vehicle. I am moving a little closer to where I work soon and am sure it will help some. I also found that driving in rush hour traffic increased my range a bit. I am learning new things every time I drive my new (well new to me) Leaf.
Many people that move from gas to electric never go back. Much about the experience is enjoyable, and it seems that you are learning as you go. Where gas cars get better fuel efficiency on the freeway, the opposite is true of an electric car. You might want to review the article about battery degeneration as well (found here). It may be that your battery has degenerated more than you realized when you bought it. If you read some of the recently popular articles and the pages indicated in the right side column you may find more useful information. Good luck.
I have been reading a bunch about the car. The battery has only lost one bar on the capacity gauge and only charges to about 80miles range but get significantly less and needs to be charged after any more than 30mins on the freeway. Seems kind of low to me. It performs way better in down town traffic and during rush hour. I love how the car drives and its comfortability. I dread a bit if I have to replace the battery so soon after purchase. Would pretty much double what I have paid for it. I am hoping it stays pretty good for a couple of years.
I, too, purchased a 2012 leaf but in 2015. One thing I’ve learned about is that the battery capacity indicator can be reset, leading you to believe the battery has greater capacity than it does. I lost 3 bars very quickly, so I’m down to 9. If it falls below 9 and I’m still within the right time and miles, then they’re supposedly going to replace the battery. Definitely take it to the dealer and have them do a battery check to get a more realistic idea of the actual battery life remaining. Also, they’ll give you a 1-800 # to call and report your situation, so you have a record in the system.
teresa – Welcome to Living LEAF. I’ve also heard that the battery capacity indicator can be reset, but I’m not sure any reputable Nissan dealer would do this. Did you buy your LEAF from a Nissan dealership, or an independent? I think anyone with access to the CAN bus system likely could perform this reset. Best of luck.
Kadri- Welcome to Living LEAF. You can order an SD card at any Nissan dealership. Not sure of the cost.
I’ve just bought my first left 2013 G and cannot wait for it to arrive from Japan, mainly to use around town and to work 10 miles away, the only problem is the radio is in Japanese, I want to change the radio which has GPS to an English version any ideas, I live in New Zealand.
Derek – Welcome to Living LEAF. As I live in the states, I don’t have any recommendations for you. I’d say in this case, Google is your friend. Best of luck!
I just bought a 15 s model with 29k miles. It charhes to 95 most of the time. I felt a very minor vibration in the wheel at speeds over 60 mph. I replaced the tires with yokahama tires. An i added new rims. Most of the wheel vibration is gone but not all. Would and alighment help. Or is a little wheel feel normal.
Bill – Welcome to Living LEAF. Generally I don’t feel any vibration through the steering system. The fact that new wheels and tires helped indicates that there may have been some mis-alignment or more that was the issue. An alignment could help. Have them check the status of your suspension and steering components while they’re at it. they may find worn or damaged components.
It seems as if when it is over 4 degrees centigrades and of course when I drive carefully (on average 70 km/h and never accelerating upphill, only downhill and then rolling upphill) it has been taking zero on the km:s , and sometimes I have even gained! This has never happened when in ECO-mode. Is my car an abnormality?
Anita – Welcome to Living LEAF. Your situation is interesting. Normally, in ECO mode you will get roughly ten percent more range than in Drive mode. Naturally, everyone will have a slightly different experience, but that generality will typically remain the same. It does seem odd that you are getting more range without ECO mode engaged. If your LEAF is providing you with satisfactory performance generally, I would not be concerned about it, but would mention it to the service department the next time you have them look at your car. All the best!
Hi Chris, Your experience is normal for an electric car. The reason that the range drops so quickly at freeway speeds (70 miles per hour and above) is that wind resistance increases dramatically as you increase your speed. This makes the car work harder to cut through the air. You have no doubt experienced this by sticking your hand out the window. Its force against your hand is much higher at 70 miles per hour than at 25 miles per hour. If you can train yourself to leave a little earlier for your commute and drive at 65 miles per hour you will find that your range improves. If you’ve only lost one capacity bar, you will likely find that your range will work for you at least for a couple years before you need to consider replacing the battery or the car. Good luck.

What is a good way to seek assistance from the PmWiki community, with the least possible waste of their time and effort, and the quickest positive outcome for respondents?
When you have an issue with PmWiki, Cookbook recipes, or the environment PmWiki is installed in, it is worthwhile to undertake some or all of the following preparations and precautions.
consider disabling all recipes in your config.php, then adding them in one at a time until the problem occurs
another useful way is to create a group and use a group specific customisation to diagnose the problem
Having done all of this, and being none the wiser about your issue (although probably somewhat wiser about PmWiki) you could
provide links to the documentation you thought pertinent and used in your research (this will also facilitate updating of the documentation)
All of these things will greatly assist and incentivise[1] those who wish to help you get to the nub of the problem without having to ask further probing questions.
If the issues turns out to be a software bug, performance issue, change request, enhancement or feature request the PmWiki Issue Tracking System (PITS?) is where you register it.
Again, all the above pertinent information should be placed in the issue report to assist in its resolution.
my life is what the blog says.....do click on my picture and it will lead you to my faccebook page where you'll be able to know me better both sides <3
Follow the work and classes of Liz Hill, a mixed media artist living in Texas. Let her hear from you.
Am not restricted to human figures only, will do a class at the Watercolor Society this weekend, wanted to show a different approach to painting.
3 DAYS, 3 WAYS TO DO CONTEMPORARY FIGURE PAINTING Liz Hill, lizhill4u@aol.com , 713-252-7726. Friday-Sunday Sept 16, 17, 18; 10:00- 4:30pm $150 Join a fun filled 3-day workshop with Liz Hill, award winning mixed media artist. Each day you will have a model in the morning, lunch, followed by the method of painting you are working on that day. You should have a finished piece at the end of each day. There will be critiques first thing the next morning. Questions? Contact Liz at Lizhill4u@aol.com or call 713-252-7726 Supply List: PAINT- any Watermedia you generally use. I prefer watercolor along with opaque paint, but acrylics painters bring either. PAPER- you will need lots of inexpensive drawing paper for the mornings. You will also need 3 sheets (22x30”) hot press 140# paper. We will tear it in half and use half two pieces each day. (Do not try these techniques on cold press paper.) I use Fabriano traditional white & will bring some with me for sale at $5 a sheet. DRAWING- …
I got overwhelmed with traveling and the holidays. Am back on center, however and getting ready to replace a painting that sold at Hubbell and Hudson. Just finished "Winter Storm".

A glossy looking button is a well known and widely used type of button that everybody knows if he or she hasn’t been on the moon the last couple of years. Apple uses these buttons excessive. In OS X as well as on iOS. Those buttons look nice and they work very well when trying to achieve a polished, three dimensional look. However, they are always used with a background color that differs from the surrounding background or the surrounding background doesn’t have much detail. This is because if you use this button on a background that has a lot of detail, like a photo, they don’t look like glass anymore, at all. The button looks very flat if you can see, that the background isn’t distorted by the ‘glass’ in any kind.
The solution to this problem sounds quite easy at first: As soon as you simply blur the background just a little, the whole thing starts looking great again. This is where CoreImage comes in handy. CoreImage has a ton of useful filters, one of them is a gaussian blur filter. Using this filter is pretty easy. All you need to do is specify you input image and the blur radius you would like to use.
Now that we know how to blur, the question would be: What to blur? And here is the point where things are getting difficult. There are three methods on CALayer that sound promising:
setBackgroundFilters: “An array of Core Image filters to apply to the content immediately behind the layer”
setFilters: “An array of Core Image filters to apply to the contents of the layer and its sublayers”
All three methods are available on iOS, you can call them, the filters are set and they will be returned if you call the getter. But that’s pretty much all these methods do, at least up to iOS6. Under “special considerations” Apple says “This property is not supported on layers in iOS”. Note that there was an error in the documentation on iOS 6.0, where it said “This property relies on the presence of Core Image and its filters. In iOS, Core Image is available in iOS 5 and later only”. They changed this in the iOS 6.1 documentation, so don’t wonder if you see the second text, you selected the old version of the CALayer documentation.
So using one of these properties won’t work on iOS. The only other approach I am aware of on iOS, is to render the underlaying layers into a context and blur it yourself. You can do this with CALayer again. The method you are looking for is -[CALayer renderInContext:]
This method renders the receiver and it’s sublayers to the context you specify. ‘But I want to render the views!’ you might think. That’s correct, but UIView is just the delegate of the underlying layer. Each UIView has a layer it is responsible for and the layer hierarchy is the same as the view hierarchy – unless you change something about this by yourself. The visible part of a UIView is the CALayer! If a view has five subviews, its layer has five sublayers and each of these sublayers belong to one of the subviews.
To render the background of the button we want to blur, we simply walk up the view hierarchy until we find the first view that is opaque. If the view is opaque we can safely render this view and its subviews without worrying about transparent parts from underlaying views.
To achieve this, we create a new graphics context in the size of the button that should get the blurred background. We don’t need to render the whole superview we just found, as we only need to blur the part that is behind our button. The rendered image is what we will use as our input image for the blur filter. Don’t forget to hide the button during rendering, otherwise the button itself will be contained in the button’s background.
After rendering the view into a CGImage we convert this to a CIImage and set it as the input image of our blur filter. If you put all this code into your button’s drawInRect: method, you can then draw the output image into the current context for displaying. After that, you can call all the other drawing code, if any, you need for your button.
Not that we render the output image with the extent of the CIImage as the blur filter will return an image that is larger than your input image. The extent property of you output image has a negative origin so that rendering the image with this extent will place your image exactly above your input image, with a border.
I have set up a GitHub project that adds a method to UIView that renders the view’s background with a given blur radius into the current context. You can call this method on any UIView in it’s drawRect: method to get a blurred background. The static library also contains two subclasses, one of UIView and one of UIButton. Those adopt this category and, aside from others, make the blur radius available as a property for easier use.
This approach only works with still backgrounds. If you have any kind of animation in the background, this will not work. If the background changes, you have to call setNeedsDisplay on the view that has the blurred background. Note that blurring takes time, it is not possible to e.g. put a UIScrollView in the back of the button and call setNeedsDisplay on every scroll position change of the scroll view.
Sick. Big assignment unfinished days after I had intended it to be. Multiple other loose ends also unfinished because all I really want to do is sleep. Exegesis failure and resultant sense of rejection and discouragement. Sermon into which I poured much of the last 1.5 years met with decidedly mixed reactions. Holy Week coming up, and that is still way too difficult for me. Discovery that some future calendar dates are going to wreak further havoc in my life.
And then yesterday one of my professors said some things to me about my call to ministry, about my writing, about some of my gifts and experiences, that were ~ well, kind of amazing.
This morning I woke up and realized that the profound sense of all-encompassing rejection that accompanies a child's suicide had pretty much eliminated any sense of self-worth on my part. So completely, in fact, that I wasn't even aware of it.
And so to have someone say things to me that extend far beyond general or basic kinds of compliments or affirmations ~ well, I am stunned.
I need to do something about my perspective. It seems that perhaps a little reorientation is in order.
And it's my experience with a different sort of dislocation of the sense of self that it's complicated to regain reality. It takes time and checking in with yourself and others. I'm glad the others are there to provide their perspective on your gifts and your calling.
Got your email and am still processing it. It's so deep that I can't just fire off a reply. I'm thinking of you with love.
yes, we wouldn't want to get too reoriented. My recent experience was that a pothole will just bring your thoughts back to the realities of the moment. But not all the way... my head is still swimming with thoughts about reorienting how I teach
It's interesting to me how, even though I don't know you/never met you, somehow I feel certain I'd agree with whatever the professor told you about your calling and your gifts, Robin. Your ability to put words to your experience is so deeply moving--the personal honesty communicates so universally...yes, let the reorientation begin!

A very difficult decision, for sure. I totally understand the dilemma and the anti-climactic feeling of the moment. Perhaps you are all ready for a tiny celebration--not a big massive one, mind you--just a little tiny one where you can mark the achievement, your hope for the future, and God's power to use even the worst things in some good way. (Which He will undoubtedly continue to use you to do.) I'm so sorry for the sadness of what should have been a very happy day.
My advice is to take some Tincture of Time and try not to think about this decision until next week. Then see how you feel about it, bearing in mind that there is no "right" answer.
are you talking about going to the graduation ceremony? graduating or not yet, as you finish course work? or having a graduation celebration?
regardless...time of transition...very hard...yes, take some time to not think about it, if you can. and then decide.

Small Business It's time for better capitalism More "Better Capitalism" » I don’t care if you’ve read a thousand books, the steps have always been the same: Fail fast, take lots of risks, and fall forward.

About fifteen kilometers east of Regensberg is an architectural marvel called Walhalla. It sits on a high hill overlooking the Danube and is modelled on the Pantheon. In the mid-19th century, King Ludwig I had this built as a Hall of Fame for distinguished Germans and people of German origin. It is home to 130 marble busts and 65 plaques commemorating famous Germans. On 22nd February 2003, the bust of Sophie Scholl was the last to be installed in Walhalla. It was the 60th anniversary of her execution by Hitler’s squads.
Sophie Scholl was born on 9th May 1921 in a little village called Forchtenberg. She was brought up as a Lutheran, by parents who were God-fearing and believed in the essential dignity of every human being irrespective of race, colour or social status. Her father was opposed to Hitler’s dictatorship and was imprisoned for telling one of his colleagues that Hitler was ‘God’s Scourge.’
The home where Sophie was born and grew up in is now the Town Hall at Forchtenberg. A small bust of Sophie stands in one corner.
Though at the age of 12, Sophie joined The League of German Girls, she soon became disillusioned with its practices. In 1940, when she finished High Scool, she became a kindergarden teacher with the hope of avoiding National Labour Service. But she was forced to do a compulsory stint as Nursery teacher in the Auxiliary War Service. This brought about an aversion towards Nazi ideology and practices.
In May 1942, Sophie entered the University of Munich as a student of Biology and Philosophy. Her brother Hans also was studying Medicine at the University. Her boy friend Fritz Hartnagel was serving in the Army on the Eastern Front. From him she received news about the atrocities conducted on prisoners of war and Jews.
Sophie was greatly influenced by the essays and sermons of Cardinal John Neumann. In1942, her brother Hans along with like-minded students Willi Graf and Christopher Probst secretly began to write anit-Nazi pamphlets, urging people to resist Hitler’s ideology. To start with, Sophie was not included in this group as they feared for her life. Later, they felt that as a woman, she would not raise suspicion when she went on her secret forays to distribute pamphlets.
This was the beginning of the ‘White Rose’ movement, which advocated passive resistance to Hitler’s dictatorship. The members were against anti-Semitism. They read books by Thomas Mann, Paul Claudel and others which was prohibited reading. They smuggled food to those in concentration camps and cared for relatives of prisoners. But their most important activity was authoring six anti-Nazi leaflets and secretly distributing them among University students. Some leaflets were sent to undetectable locations for distribution. They used their own pocket money for paper, envelopes, stamps, and printed them out on their typewriters.
Unfortunately, during the distribution of the sixth leaflet, they were caught by one of Hitler’s spies and sentenced to death for treason at the People’s Court, by a cruel judge called Roland Freisler. That Sophie limped into the courttoom with a broken leg was proof of the torture she underwent in jail. At her trial and sentencing, Sophie based her defence on ‘The Theology of Conscience’ referred to by Cardinal Neumann.
“Somebody afterall has to make a start. What we wrote and said is also believed by many others. They just don’t dare to express themselves as we did.”
Sophie and the members of the White Rose Resistance showed exceptional spiritual courage in the face of death. They were not afraid to verbalize their collective dissent against Hitler’s absolute dictatorship. Sophie recalled the words of her father when she was growing up. “What I want for you is to live in uprightness and freedom of spirit, no matter how difficult that proves to be.”
Ironically, the sixth leaflet was smuggled out to UK and used by the Allies. They dropped millions of copies over Germany under a new title, “The Manifesto of The Students of Munich.”
Sophie was just 21 when she and other members, were beheaded at Stadelheim Prison in Munich on 22nd February 1943. They are buried in the Perlacher Friedhof next to the prison. Her last words were ,”Such a fine day and I have to go. But what does my death matter if through us thousands of people are awakened and stirred into action!”
Many children born during that time were named after Sophie and her brother. The German Major Brigitte called her the greatest German woman of the 20th century. Later, films and books were made, based on her life. The most comprehensive book released in 2009 was titled “Sophie Scholl –The Real Story of A Woman Who Defied Hitler.”

Standing at Shada’s grave site made me reflect on my own life. Shada was a good comrade. She was highly valued by the “Company.” When she decided to disappear, there was a void left in our ranks. Although I was sorry to see her leave the “Company,” somehow, I had felt deep down that she was probably still alive.
It had been reported that she perished in an aviation accident. Like everyone else, I accepted the fact the she was gone. Then one day, I was tasked with confirming her death by examining the wreckage of the aircraft. The aircraft had been spotted from the air in the Darien Gap. The Darien Gap is an impenetrable jungle south of Panama on the border with Colombia. The Pan American Highway on the north side ends at the Gap and does not continue until well into Colombia. Due to the denseness and the marshy composite of the soil, it made connecting the highway from north to the south impossible. Shada’s aircraft had been down in the Gap for over two years before it was discovered. Due to the condition of the aircraft from the air, it was believed that no one could have survived the accident.
When I inspected the aircraft, the flight deck was empty. On the floor in front of the second seat was a brochure advertising St. Kitts. That convinced me that Shada had faked her demise. I was very fond of Shada.
We were comrades and spent many hours together accomplishing missions. We had discussed retiring from the “Company” in the past. It has become common knowledge that one cannot retire from the “Company.” If you attempt a retirement, the “Company” will hunt you down and neutralize you. I was witness to that fact on several occasions.
I covered for Shada by producing phony photos of remains in a cockpit of a Cherokee aircraft. After presenting the photos to the Colonel, the CEO of the “Company,” he bought the fact that she was in fact dead. However, the client, a woman by the name of Nefertiabet was not convinced. She believed that Shada had murdered her father. Her father had sexually abused Shada while he had her as a prisoner in his house in Alexandria, Egypt. That convinced Nefertiabet that Shada had a motive.
I traveled to St. Kitts and met with Shada. Shada had developed a new life practicing medicine. She had also got married and had a child. I learned that Nefertiabet was intending to have an independent company return to the aircraft and take samples of the remains. Nefertiabet had samples of Shada’s DNA from a hair brush that she has once used for comparison. Shada could not allow that to happen. I assisted her to plan a mission to neutralize Nefertiabet. She returned to Panama to execute the plan. Shada was fatally shot during the course of the mission. I left her body for the authorities to find. I returned to St. Kitts and informed her husband of her death. I accompanied him back to Panama to claim her remains. Her body was returned to St. Kitts for burial.
Immediately after the funeral, I offered my condolences to her husband. Then I left for the airport. I did not want to stay in St. Kitts any longer than was necessary. I got on a flight to Aruba with a connecting flight to Miami. When I boarded the flight to Miami, I was seated in the business class. Within a few minutes of getting buckled up, a young woman sat down beside me. At first, I did not pay any attention to her. As the aircraft began to taxi to the runway, her presence had this magnetic pull on my physical. I looked over and what I saw had an electric shock vibrate through my body. She could pass as a double for a young woman that I had been involved with years ago. The woman was several years older than me. I believed that we were hopelessly in love. I entered the military shortly after completing high school. I expected to eventually marry the woman in question. However, during my first deployment, I received a “Dear John” letter. I threw myself into my military career and became a “Ranger” in the Special Forces.
Almost an hour passed as I sat in my seat reminiscing the past of many years ago. I finally got up my nerve and asked her the big question. “Excuse me. I said. Please don’t take this the wrong way, but you look so much like a young woman that I once knew. I wonder if you would mind answering a few questions for me.” She looked at me and smiled. She extended her hand and told me her name was “Helen Majors.” I introduced myself. I informed her that she could be a double for a young woman that I had been involved with years ago. “I had heard that she passed away recently.” I said. I asked her mother’s maiden name. When she told me the name, I knew that the resemblance was just a coincidence. I inquired if she was going to Miami for vacation. Miss Majors said that she was actually returning from a vacation. She said that she had recently completed nursing school. A nursing position was in the offing and she was to report to her new job on Monday. We continued to exchange niceties for a few minutes and then I went back to my thoughts.
My name is Ebi. I am a second generation American. My parents emigrated from Iran when I was two years old. My father was an engineer and had worked for an American company in Iran. When he was transferred to America, his family became eligible for citizenship. My father made a very good salary and sent me to the best schools. I was an only child. My parents gave me the best of everything. My mother taught me her native language as well as English in my formative years.
I became infatuated with the young woman that watched my sister and me when my parents were out for an evening. She was about five years older than I, but as I grew into to my later teens we became romantically involved. I lost my virginity to her.
When I graduated from high school, I decided to join the military. My father was very disappointed that I decided not to go to college. Francesca, my romantic interest, was disappointed as well. We agreed that when I was financially established that we would marry. I was deployed oversees and was gone for two years. One day, I received a letter from Francesca that she had married someone else. I was devastated. I threw myself into my career. After ten years in Special Forces, I was offered a lucrative job with the “Company.” That was ten years ago. My life became the “Company.” Recently, however, I have become distraught with what I am doing. I decided to continue for another year or two while I plan my retirement and escape.
I continued my conversation with Ms. Majors. As we approached the Miami airport, I turned to Ms. Majors and said that I enjoyed our conversation. “I was wondering, I asked. Do you think we could meet and talk at another time?” She took a pen from her purse and wrote down her cell phone number. She handed me that paper. I in turn gave her my number. I said that I was planning to be back in Miami in a few weeks. I would like to take her to dinner and continue our conversation.

MedReleaf – based in Markham, Ontario and traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol LEAF – said in a news release the underwriters have an option to increase the proceeds from the bought deal transaction by an additional CA$9 million.
Under the deal, the underwriters agreed to purchase slightly more than 6 million MedReleaf shares at a price of CA$16.55 per share from both MedReleaf and a group of five selling shareholders.
MedReleaf and the shareholders will divvy up the proceeds at CA$60 million and CA$40.5 million, respectively.
Separately, MedReleaf’s joint venture partner in Australia, Indica Industries Pty, was granted a license from the Australian Government Office of Drug Control for the cultivation and production of medical cannabis.
The license will begin in November 2018 so Indica can complete infrastructure development of its cultivation and production facilities, the company said in a news release.

Elite athletes are often told to work through their pain… it may be more than merely stoic advice. Some athletes with disabilities have discovered injuring themselves enhances their performance. It works so well, it’s against the rules. The International Paralympic Committee has banned the practice. but that hasn’t stopped some athletes to continue to seek out the competitive edge.
Breaking toes, sticking themselves with pins, filling their bladders and any number of other things to give themselves momentary bursts of adrenaline or elevated heart rates. One guy explains via audio embedded on the linked article what it feels like to get electric shocks and how it helps him in rock climbing.
Obviously there are limits to comparisons between paralympic athletes and baseball players in that some of the “boosts” paralympians might give themselves could be specific to dealing with their disabilities. But I am fascinated by the body hack aspects to all of this.
On some level all athletes have done this forever. Rituals they use to pump themselves up, foods they eat, clothes they wear under their uniform and so on could give them mental edges and perhaps physical edges as well. But I bet there are a lot of other things baseball players could do that they haven’t even thought of to help them out in terms of adrenaline and heart rate boosting. I wonder how much of it goes on we don’t know about. And whether, if we did know more about it, people would consider it unfair or call for bans on the practice.
MLB.com’s Mark Feinsand reports that, while there is no official word yet, Hyun-Jin Ryu will “most likely” accept the Dodgers’ one-year, $17.9 million qualifying offer.
Ryu posted a 1.97 ERA in to 82.1 regular-season innings, with his season shortened due to recovery from injury. He was pretty darn good in the postseason too, though his ERA was inflated somewhat thanks to Ryan Madson allowing his inherited runners to score like it was his job or something. Either way: given his durability issues over the past few seasons, it’s not at all clear that there was a massive multi-year deal in the offing for the soon-to-be-32-year-old pitcher, so accepting the qualifying offer is probably a pretty good move for him.
All players who received a qualifying offer have until 5PM today to make a decision on them. Others, besides Ryu, who got them: Yasmani Grandal, Patrick Corbin, Bryce Harper, Dallas Keuchel, Craig Kimbrel, and A.J. Pollock.

Well known big box and mall staple clothing store (rhymes with Moldy Gravy) posts sign at cash “Like us on Facebook for 10% off your purchases”.
Fire up the mobile app (with no in-store WiFi mind you) and wait while the line grows behind. Fat thumb through the non-intuitive path to get to the brand’s specific store location and manage to hit the “Like”.
Person behind the counter actually checks your status is now set to “Like”. (Full credit to retailer for that small but critical step of verifying the discount hoops were jumped through properly.)
Immediately, upon application of discount, thumb still conveniently hovering right over the “Unlike” bar still on screen, it gets hit. Get out of the pool, pack up the kids and head for the parking lot.
The “Like Economy” now dictates a pay-to-play model. We knew it was coming. It is a transient and false economy that means nothing especially when gamed on by both sides by brand and consumer.
Klout is all the rage. I’m not buying in quite yet but that does not necessarily mean you should be overly influenced by my opinion. Or should you?
Either way, this little video made met chuckle. I believe it highlights the real disconnect of those who are overly influenced about the all influencing going on.

Hillarious little take on the social network of choice for over a half-billion of us (and counting) and the “personas” we have come to know and love. Actually, not so much on the love thing. Perhaps it is just a “like”.
Courtesy of Altoids and their agency The Evolution Bureau, the Altoid’s Curiously Strong Awards honors the “Stars of Facebook” and is a wonderful glimpse into the characters that are are all a part of the zeitgeist of Facebook we have grown accustom to (not this Zeitgeist, mind you).
Their excessive liking and ridiculous wall posts have become our escape from the monotony of the real world. Without these friends, Facebook would just be the local news.
Released on the Altoids Facebook page, you can even award a friend via a Facebook application. Anyways…, time to log off… I’ll be back in two minutes.
Is there a list of companies or brands with corporate Facebook pages, YouTube channels or Twitter streams that still feel it necessary to block their workforce from accessing at work? I’ll bet this kind of list exists and is, unfortunately, still pretty long.
Chris Anderson, Clay Shirky, Digital Marketing, Don Tapscott, Joseph Jaffe, Kevin Roberts, Marketing, Mitch Joel, Seth Godin, Six Pixels of Separation, Social Media
If you follow Mitch Joel by reading his blog, or listening to his podcast (or if you have ever had the chance hear him speak live) you’ll get through Six Pixels of Separation quickly. As he does in other communication mediums, he breaks down the subject matter into understandable chunks that not only make sense, but are made quite compelling.
Six Pixels of Separation is a straightforward premise that we are all connected. And, that our ever expanding digital universe is bringing us all closer together. But it is not about understanding technology. It is about the transformative effects of technology on business, built on the foundation that we are living through a period of history unlike any other. It is about the merger of our personal and professional lives and the paradigm shift that the marketing and communications industry faces as new media evolves and the consumer landscape evolves with it.
Under that guiding principle, Mitch lays out concepts, observations and examples taking his readers on an enjoyable ride through the digital world with a focus on what it means for businesses big and small to operate in this space. He effectively blends and extends from other thought leaders in marketing like Kevin Roberts, Seth Godin, Chris Anderson, Clay Shirky, Don Tapscott and Joseph Jaffe, putting his own point of view and spin on them. Even sharpening them in places.
He has stated that the book is simply the prelude to his blog. Having read his blog daily, I think the book is a bit more than that. It manages to synthesize all the ideas and opinions Mitch has put out there over the years, neatly framing them in a very fluid and coherent manner. And, with a background in journalism, he writes rather well. That is why I started reading his blog in the first place and why I – and many others – continue.
I could easily say that the book is not for me. Or, that it may not be for people who read this blog because we are in this space and know it intimately. However, that is not the case. Mitch shines in making the topics approachable and exciting for both newbie and advanced audiences. Six Pixels of Separation pays careful attention to weave together the larger context of what is taking place, painting a picture that (hopefully) serves to motivate readers that the future is still unwritten and everyone is an author.
Make no mistake, this is not a “how to” book. This is the book you need to read before you get to the “how to” stage. Mitch avoids getting into the weeds of providing step by step instructions and concedes it was done on purpose. He manages to stay the course, guiding readers on bigger issues and logical first steps that answer the most important question of “why would we do this” instead of “how do we use the tools”. The difference is huge.
Six Pixels of Separation is about finding the inspiration to start planning your approach with the confidence you are heading in the right direction. I enjoyed reading it and think you will as well.
I’ve had just about my fill of this genre of video, but this one caught my eye because it is loaded with some great statistics. It reinforces how well beyond we are in terms of limiting our thinking to “social media” and must broaden our scope to see the profound changes going on all around us. It goes so much deeper and wider than the hype of Ashton Kutcher tweeting, but at the same time has everything to do with the fact that Kelso is part and parcel of it all.
Don’t think for a minute this digital ride is going to slow down to let you catch your breath. It is only getting faster and more exciting, and the really cool news is that we are still just at the beginning.
How does an airline get your attention with the pre-flight safety speech? Even better, how can they do it when you are not even on the plane yet? Well, one way is to strip the crew, body paint uniforms on them and video tape the whole deal. Most would agree that might make for a more interesting run through of the run down on the runway.
Of course, this is a not going to fly when the plane is full of passengers. So, doing a YouTube only video shoot is certain to get some attention. Now, while I’m quite certain no one wants an airline to joke or make light of onboard safety, I believe this is done in good taste (somewhat at least) and shows a some brand personality. There is even a blooper real
Effective use of YouTube? Sure, why not. The next time I fly, I don’t have to pretend I am listening and can boast to the passengers all around me that I watched the entire safety routine from the comfort of my own home. Heck, I can even watch it in flight on my laptop or iTouch if WiFi is available.
Not all “sites” are online. This clever little thirty-second spot from Coleman pokes a bit of fun at the social web with the voice of Sam Elliott adding a nice touch.

Amanda French, Contents, Copyright, Facebook, Facebook Terms of Service, Flickr, Legal, LinkedIn, Mark Zuckerberg, My Space, Privacy, You Tube
Truth is that most people with profiles on Facebook don’t know that Facebook (the company) can use whatever you put there for themselves, or is allowed to sub-license your content to others to use for whatever purpose they see fit. That has been policy as long as I can remember (since I signed up that is). After considering what it meant for my purposes I was okay with it. The “out” always seemed to be either removing content or closing your account.
As of February 4 2009, Facebook now claims the right to profile content forever, no matter if you remove it or close your account. Facebook previously stated:
“You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. If you choose to remove your User Content, the license granted above will automatically expire, however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content.”
Those lines have now been removed and profile content will now survive removal of materials or termination of service.
Those who pay attention to the legal ramifications of Terms and Conditions and Terms of Service agreements, and take concern with the privacy implications and appropriate usage of content posted via social networks, are brewing a well-deserved storm over the subtle but significant changes from Facebook.
David Weinberger posted a link to a Facebook group opposed to the new Terms of Service and there are about 6,500 people already signed up. The mission of the group states:
We would like to have the Terms of Service changed back to how they were before Feb 4th 2009, including these lines:
“You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. If you choose to remove your User Content, the license granted above will automatically expire, however you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content”
The majority of users are most probably unaware of the Terms of Service to begin with and, the average Joe or Jane on Facebook likey have no clue that changes were made. Ask yourself how often you read legal stuff before you click ” I agree”? Ignorance is bliss. So, the word needs to spread.
Update: Forgot to include Mark Zuckerberg’s note about it AND a great post from Amanda French comparing TOS from MySpace, Flickr, YouTube, LinkedIn and other sites to FaceBook.
Digital Graffiti From Twitter Fight Reminds Us Of Things To Keep In Mind When Using 140 Characters Or Less
Ian Capstick of Media Style has a good summary of National Post reporter David George-Cosh who launched a mini Twitter tirade this week at April Dunford, formerly of Nortel (whom I met a while back when we were both judges for the Canadian Investment Awards). The issue at hand seems to be that April apparently did not return David’s calls which resulted in the exchange captured in the image below (photo credit to Media Style). Warning … there are a few F-bombs contained in the back and forth.
1.	Think before you publish. It is your personal long tail of content, your own digital graffiti. Digital graffiti is different as it does not get covered up with other graffiti. It spreads and remains searchable. The instantaneous nature of Twitter can get you in hot water if you are careless.
2.	Understand the community. It is not just your friends or colleagues that are listening. What you think may be an innocent comment could easily blow up (re: the unintended Fed Ex mess from Key Influencer James Andrews)
3.	Take the high road. Say something positive and avoid becoming “that guy/girl”. It is too easy to join in with the “pile-on” mentality and become part of the trash talk crowd (no matter who is in the right). Those who differentiate themselves usually find the insight and communicate it without having to slam anyone.
4.	Add value. Twitter is powerful and interesting (at least I find it to be) when others pointed to great content and topical information/events/memes. I am more interested in what others are reading than what they are doing. “I’m walking the dog” updates are don’t do it for me. Make us laugh, think and read more stuff we would not otherwise find.
5.	Not all conversations should be made public. Ask yourself, “is it more appropriate or better suited to use the direct message feature, or perhaps even an old school email?
6.	Bring someone new into the conversation outside of your industry. Twitter is extending its reach beyond the early adopters and the typical participants in the echo-chamber. It is becoming more and more mainstream. There are many interesting people and personalities from politicians to celebrities, journalists and others walks of life adding color and commentary to the space.
Bottom line is that it is almost too easy to get on board and start using Twitter. There is no learners permit. Best advice is to look before you leap because it is not fun to learn the hard way.
While we are on the topic of Twitter, Tweetdeck has just sent out an update (if you are not using Tweetdeck, you are missing out on a robust way to tap into the platform). It is a rocking Adobe Air application that includes an embedded tiny URL feature and displays columns for sorting who you are following direct messages, favourites, hash tags and the like. The update also allows you to translate from other native languages and a neat new feature Stock Twits. Check it out.

"Where money issues meet IP rights". This weblog looks at financial issues for intellectual property rights: securitisation and collateral, IP valuation for acquisition and balance sheet purposes, tax and R&D breaks, film and product finance, calculating quantum of damages--anything that happens where IP meets money.
One concern since the Bayh-Dole Act was passed in the United States has been the effect of the Act on the direction of research. Would the Bayh-Dole Act—allowing grant recipients such as universities to take title to government funded invention—make researchers move their agendas away from basic research to applied research? To many, this would be a negative impact of the Act; although some would disagree. And, to some, the movement to applied research is not happening fast enough. I have heard rumors over the years that some universities have already changed tenure standards for professors in the “hard” sciences to include things such as, number of company spin-outs or patents. The other day I received an email from Technology Transfer Tactics which mentions a possible “policy change” in tenure standards at Oklahoma State University and a change in standards at the University of Texas. Apparently, the changes include adding commercialization factors. Here is the text of some of the email:
The push for commercialization of university research has become more like a giant shove. Federal and state governments are pinning their hopes on it, economic development agencies work hard to enable it, and university presidents demand it. Pitch competitions, accelerators, funding schemes, outreach efforts, partnerships, incubators, and mentoring programs abound, all trying to encourage it. But there is one glaring, gigantic disconnect in the innovation ecosystem: tenure policy.
While the drumbeat sounds for new models of entrepreneurship and commercialization support, a very old model -- steeped in the academic traditions of yesteryear -- presents a major barrier to realizing the full potential of university innovations. Tenure policies, which reward publishing and teaching but do nothing to incentivize commercialization, arguably represent the single biggest missing link in the innovation ecosystem that so many now agree is critical to economic growth, jobs, and global competitiveness.
These policies -- if they are adjusted to take commercial-focused research into account -- also represent a tremendous untapped opportunity for universities to unleash a deluge of research with market potential, by simply rewarding the behavior that forms the essential foundation for the dynamic innovation activity the world is clamoring for. But changing the entrenched system is anything but simple.
While most university systems continue to resist formal recognition of commercialization activities when evaluating faculty for tenure, a select few have emerged on the leading edge of this issue. Oklahoma State University and the University of Texas System have both gone down the road of including commercialization within their tenure policies. In fact, OSU is currently in the throes of policy change. * * *
Please join Bryan T. Allinson, Executive Director of Technology Commercialization for the University of Texas System - Austin, and Dr. Stephen W. S. McKeever, Vice President for Research and Technology Transfer with Oklahoma State University, for this cutting-edge program. These forward-thinking leaders will present case studies illustrating the key strategies used to gain administration and faculty support, as well as the specifics of their tenure policy changes. Here’s a quick look at the agenda:
Wow! Will basic research be a thing of the past? Changing tenure standards is extreme and a huge threat to academic freedom that I suspect will be ultimately very harmful to the production of break through research that benefits the public. Does anyone have any information about what is happening at OSU? Also, has anyone’s university changed its tenure policies to include commercialization-related factors? If so, I am very interested to see your policy.
I know someone with a lectureship at a well known UK university. During his reviews it was made clear that he was expected to bring in money from industry to support his work. That did not happen and a little while later his lectureship has been terminated. I'm not saying that the university is throwing him out because of not bringing money in, but I think it's a factor. So I think commercialisation pressure on academics is already there, especially at the more junior levels, but no one has really studied how powerful or prevalent it is.
Thank you very much for the information. That is very helpful and what happend to your acquaintance is very unfortunate. This issue deserves study. Thank you again. Best, Mike

An additional crucial main reason of iPhone 6s selling as hotcakes is a pressure-sensitive screen which opens up genuinely beneficial new capability. You will never find this component in another mobile phone in the market. Let's see how these functions have been giving in improving performance of business people around the world.
The updated iPhone evidently doesn't seem a lot different from the previous model, yet it's truly received sturdier meantime. In iPhone 6s, extra heavy duty Aluminum is used for the rear of the equipment and the front door is produced from a more durable pane of glass. So, when you drop your phone by mistake, there are lesser opportunities that your smartphone will certainly shatter and that's a large advantage if you according to your smartphone for your job.
Senior citizen entrepreneurs or seniors have certainly been appreciating the rather spacious sizes of the display screen which is practical in supplying sufficient volume of space for watching essential emails and modifying official documents. It has 4.7-inch display with a sharp text and vibrant colors. An additional noteworthy capability of iPhone 6s is that it's absolutely brilliant having 452 nits of brightness whereas the average brightness of other good smartphones is 430 nits. This kind of rich display screen is simpler to watch outdoors or within straight sun light.
Entrepreneurs enjoy the 3D touch feature of iPhone 6s since it allows the user to carry out various things with a number of all new actions (pressure sensitive gestures) depending upon the situation. This capability conserves effort and time and helps make iPhone very sophisticated. For example, in the event that you intend to look at your e-mails, you tap the mail app once and launch the inbox. Then, pressing down difficult on an email message in your inbox lets you preview it. You can also slide to the right to trash it, slide to the left to mark it as review or swipe up to reply.
Apple's A9 brand-new cpu has produced iPhone 6s, one of the quickest mobile phone of the world. This particular cpu of the brand new iPhone surpasses all the competitors, including Samsung Galaxy S6. When iPhone 6s's speed was checked to open up a 1.6 GB PDF file, it took merely 82 milliseconds whereas Galaxy S6, in contrast, took 127 milliseconds.
The new iPhone 6s has iOS 9, a new model of Apple's mobile systems program, which gives a lot of characteristics in order to help you to be much more productive. Siri, Apple's virtual assistant has also been refreshed and today this application works far better compared to before. It is not only capable of recognizing commands, but also more active at alerts and reminders. Whether it's your appointment or an important business meeting, Siri attends to remind you. It will definitely also help you to estimate travel time based on traffic conditions in order that you create for a session at the correct time. The keyboard is also enhanced. It maintains record of your routinely used attributes like copy, paste and helps make your access easy to them for the next time.
Apple's Touch ID fingerprint sensor is very useful for the business owners. They don't need to set security password each time to start up their mobile phone. The scanner determines the fingerprint of the owner and unlocks the phone quickly. It wouldn't work if it does not determine the owner, hence keep the personal and corporate info safe. The sensor is located in the home button.
Video conferencing is a medium to keep upgraded and gotten in touch with long-distance clients and partners. It is vital for online meetings with overseas customers. Its front facing camera is of 5 mega pixels, which captures very clear pictures with richer, more accurate colors, especially in low-light situations like in an office.

IPPNW firmly believes that chemical weapons, and any weapon of mass destruction, should never be used, and existing stockpiles should be eliminated in line with the Chemical Weapons Convention.
Chemical weapons are banned because of their capacity to cause indiscriminate deaths in large numbers,extreme suffering and long-term disability. It is essential that whatever stockpiles of chemical weapons exist in Syria are maintained in a safe condition prior to their final elimination, which should be achieved as rapidly as possible. A cessation of hostilities would provide a much more favourable context for this to happen.
We call on all parties involved in the present conflict in Syria to ensure that any existing stockpiles of chemical weapons are placed under safeguards and that there is no intentional use, or threat of use, whatever the circumstances. UN weapons inspectors must be allowed full, safe and timely access to investigate suspected chemical weapons use. If the facts determine that chemical weapons have been used, then those who used them should be brought before the International Criminal Court and held accountable for crimes against humanity.
We call on all sides to cooperate with the UN and Arab League Special Envoy to Syria in his quest to resolve the present conflict through dialogue. The present suffering of civilians in areas controlled by thevgovernment and by the opposition forces is unacceptable and a ceasefire needs to be negotiated as soon as possible.
IPPNW demands free and safe access of the population to medical care. To make medical facilities and personnel a target of violence is unacceptable and a gross violation of international humanitarian law. We urge all parties to the civil war in Syria to engage in negotiations to resolve the conflict. We demand from all countries and parties outside Syria that they stop delivering weapons into Syria.

Carnegie Endowment for International peace Report ... to inquire into the causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars
The circumstances which attended the Balkan wars of 1912 and 1913 were of such character as to fix upon them the attention of the civilized world. The conflicting reports as to what actually occurred before and during these wars, together with the persistent rumors often supported by specific and detailed statements as to violations of the laws of war by the several combatants, made it important that an impartial and exhaustive examination should be made of this entire episode in contemporary history. The purpose of such an impartial examination by an independent authority was to inform public opinion and to make plain just what is or may be involved in an international war carried on under modern conditions. If the minds of men can be turned even for a short time away from passion, from race antagonism and from national aggrandizement to a contemplation of the individual and national losses due to war and to the shocking horrors which modern warfare entails, a step and by no means a short one, will have been taken toward the substitution of justice for force in the settlement of international differences.
It was with this motive and for this purpose that the Division of Intercourse and Education of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace constituted in July, 1913, an International Commission of Inquiry to study the recent Balkan wars and to visit the actual scenes where fighting had taken place and the territory which had been devastated. The presidency of this International Commission of Inquiry was entrusted to Baron d'Estournelles de Constant, Senator of France, who had represented his country at the First and Second Hague Conferences of 1899 and of 1907, and who as President Fondateur of the Conciliation Internationale, has labored so long and so effectively to bring the various nations of the world into closer and more sympathetic relations. With Baron d'Estournelles de Constant there were associated men of the highest standing, representing different nationalities, who were able to bring to this important task large experience and broad sympathy.
The result of the work of the International Commission of Inquiry is contained in the following report. This report, which has been written without prejudice and without partisanship, is respectfully commended to the attention of the governments, the people and the press of the civilized world. To those who so generously participated in its preparation as members of the International Commission of Inquiry, the Trustees of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace offer an expression of grateful thanks.
Why this report, this inquiry? Is it necessary after so many other reports and investigations, after so many eloquent appeals made in vain, - appeals to pity, indignation and revolt, ringing at one and the same time from all countries,. and from all parties, uttered by the voices of Gladstone, of Bryce, of Pressense, of Jaures, of Victor Berard, of Pierre Quillard, of Anatole Leroy-Beaulieu, of Denys Cochin, and how many more great hearted men of world wide authority? It seems as if all this had gone for nothing. The facts that face us today are a tragic and derisive denial that any good has come of all this eloquence and feeling. Would it not be better for us to remain silent, and let things go?
We have been silent, we have let things go long enough. From the beginning of the first war, and in the terrible uncertainties of the following days, I denounced that one amongst the Balkan rulers, who took upon himself,-he being the only one who had nothing to lose by it,-except the lives of his subjects!-to precipitate the war. But that being done, we could only wish for the triumph of four young allied peoples in shaking off the domination of the Sultans of Constantinople, in the interest of the Turks and perhaps of Europe herself.
Let us repeat, for the benefit of those who accuse us of "bleating for peace at any price," what we have always maintained:
I hoped that this collective victory, heretofore considered impossible, of the allies over Turkey,-which had just concluded peace with Italy and which we still believed formidable,-would free Europe from the nightmare of the Eastern question and give her the unhoped for example of the union and coordination which she lacks.
We know how this first war, after having exhausted, as it seemed, all that the belligerents could lavish, in one way or another, of heroism and blood, was only the prelude to a second fratricidal war between the allies of the previous day, and how this second war was the more atrocious of the two.
Many of our friends urged us from that time to organize a mission, charged either to intervene or to become a witness in the tragedy. We refused to authorize any such premature manifestation, which could only be unavailing. As a matter of fact, none of the interested governments could admit, in the train of their armies, spectators who were independent judges. But peace at last
accomplished, our caution had no further excuse. Our American friends understood this when they asked us to act, and we have not hesitated to respond to their insistence. The Americans, unlike Europe, do not approve of resignation, silence, withdrawal. They are young, and they can not endure an evil which is not proved to them to be absolutely incurable. Not the slightest doubt can be cast upon their impartiality in regard to the belligerents, the United States being the adopted country of important rival colonies, notably of an admirable Greek colony. For my part, I should not have accepted the responsibility of organizing a mission of whose disinterestedness and justice I had not been fully assured.
I love Greece. The breath of her war of independence inspired my youth, I am steeped in the heroic memories that live in the hearts of her children, in her folk songs, in her language, which I used to speak, in the divine air of her plains and mountains. Along her coasts every port, every olive wood or group of laurels, evokes the sacred origin of our civilization. Greece was the starting point of my active life and labor. [See footnote, page 3] She is for the European and the American more than a cradle, a temple or a hearth, which each of us dreams of visiting one day in pilgrimage. I do not confine myself to respecting and cherishing her past. I believe in her future, in her eager, almost excessive, intelligence. But the more I love Greece, the more do I feel it my duty in the crisis of militarism which is menacing her now in her turn, to tell the truth and to serve her by this, as I serve my own country, while so many others injure her by flattery.
I presided over the famous Chateau d'Eau meeting on February 13, 1903, and came forward as a politician for Bulgaria and all the oppressed populations of the Balkan peninsula.That was a splendid year of agitation for great causes, for justice, liberty and peace; it was the unofficial but popular beginning of the Anglo-French entente cordiale.Generous year of 1903!My friends and I responded without any hesitation to the noble effort of growth and progress, of the material, intellectual and moral culture of Bulgaria.
As for Servia, whom we have never held responsible for the sufferings she has undergone, I count among her diplomats, more than colleagues, friends, men of the finest character who have impressed themselves upon the esteem of the political personnel (staff) of all Europe.
In Montenegro, where my duty as a Member of the International Commission appointed after the Berlin Treaty (1879-80), took me formerly to settle the boundaries of its rugged frontier, I knew some excellent men. I refrain from naming them, if they still live, for fear of compromising them, and I may say that I pitied them from the bottom of my heart, less for the heap of stones out of which fate made their country, than for the government that rules the stones. When European disagreements suspended our
labors, I profited by them to travel in solitude through High Albania.I crossed the sad and fertile country from Scutari to Uskub, allaying the suspicions of Ypek, of Djyakoo and of Prisrend, then in full anarchy. I shall never forget the impression of sadness and astonishment that I carried away from this adventurous expedition. All these countries, not far from us, were then, and are still, unlike Europe, more widely separated from her than Europe from America; no one knew anything of them, no one said anything about them. I scarcely dared at this epoch, to publish, unsigned as a matter of professional discretion, a sketch of the ineffaceable impressions produced on me. [Mach. Recit de moeurs de la Haute Albanie par P. H. Constant. Revue des Deux Mondes, 1 mars 1881. See in the same Revue several studies on Provincial Life in Greece, and under this same title a volume in 8°, Hachette 1878, id. Dionitza 1878; Galathee, Ernest Leroux, 1 vol. in 18 Paris 1878; Pygmalion, 1 vol. in 18; A. Lemerre, Paris, Les Trois Soeurs, text from a popular Greek tale, published in the Annual of the Association for Greek Studies; id. L'lle de Chypre; Lettres inedites de Coray; Superstitions of Modern Greece, Nineteenth Century, 1880, London.] And nevertheless, all this horror will not cease to exist as long as Europe continues to ignore it. These peoples, mingled in an inextricable confusion of languages and religions, of antagonistic race and nationality, Turks, Bulgarians, Servians, Serbo-Croatians, Servians speaking Albanian, Koutzo-Valacks, Greeks, Albanians, Tziganes, Jews, Roumanians, Hungarians, Italians, are not less good or less gifted than other people in Europe and America. Those who seem the worst among them have simply lived longer in slavery or destitution.They are martyrs rather than culprits. The spectacle of destitute childhood in a civilized country is beginning to rouse the hardest hearts. What shall be said of the destitution of a whole people, of several nations, in Europe, in the Twentieth Century?
This is the state of things which the Americans wish to help in ending. Let them be thanked and honored for their generous initiative. I have been appealing to it for a long time, since my first visit to the United States in 1902. We are only too happy today to combine our strength, too willing to raise with them a cry of protestation against the contempt of the sceptics and ill-wishers who will try to suppress it.
How is the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace going to make an investigation into the atrocities committed in the Balkans? Why should a Commission interfere? If it discover that the atrocities were inevitable, inseparable from the condition of war, what an exposure of the powerlessness of civilization! If it find, as certain newspapers proclaim, that the evils are to be imputed to some and not to others, what hatred and bitterness will be
re-awakened between the scarcely pacified belligerents! We have heard this argument for thirty years. It has helped the evil to live and grow. We know what we must think about the results of European abstention. It is the fear of compromise, the fear of displeasing one or another of the nations, the terror, in short, of intervening reasonably and in time, which has brought about a crisis, the gravity of which is not only of yesterday and of today, but also of tomorrow. It is to the interest of all the governments, as well as of the peoples, that the light of truth should at last illuminate and regenerate these unhappy countries. The duty and the purpose of the Carnegie Endowment was to contribute in dissipating the shadows and dangers of a night indefinitely prolonged.
It has been further asked: What are you going to do in the Balkans, you French, you Americans, you English, you Russians, you Germans? Have you not enough to do with Morocco to look after, with Mexico, with South Africa, India, Persia? Yes, we have plenty to do at home, but let us give up all exterior action if we pretend to wait until everything in our own house or conduct is reformed, before we can attempt to help others. I do not consider the French State more perfect than any other human organization, but nevertheless my own imperfection need not prevent me from doing my utmost to be useful.
Other objections are of a less elevated order, but not less insistent. This for example: that everyone does not lose by war. Without speaking of the patriotism kept alive by war, the Great Powers lend their money to the belligerents and sell them the materials of war. This is good for trade and enriches both bankers and contractors. War is exhibited as an operation of twofold patriotism, of moral benefit, because it exalts heroism, and of material profit because it increases several important industries. A little more, and we shall be told that it nourishes the population!
We have replied to these sophisms over and over again. Once more we shall set aside the war that is defensive and in the cause of independence. Such a war is not to be confounded with any other, because it is the resistance to war, to conquest, to oppression. It is the supreme protest against violence, and generally the protest of the weak against the strong. Such was the first Balkan war,-and for this reason it was glorious and popular throughout the civilized world. We are only speaking of real war, such as a State undertakes in order to extend its possessions, or to assert its strength to the detriment of another country;-this was the case in the second Balkan war. Today no one gains in this sort of warfare. Both victor and vanquished lose morally and materially. It is false that peace encourages slothfulness. To speak only of France living under a rule of peace that has lasted for forty-three years, never has youth been more enterprising, more daring, more patriotic than in our day. In default of a war, courage applies itself to fertile invention, towards
exploration, to dangerous scientific experiments, to aerial and submarine navigation. Is this a sign of decadence?
And as for trade, which certainly gains by selling a battleship at nearly a hundred million francs, is it possible not to foresee the terrible stoppage of work and the consequent crisis, that must ensue when the peoples, tired of the ruinous competition, will claim a juster balance between the expenditure really necessary for national defense, and that wanted for developing the resources of each country and its useful activity? Nobody will contest the fact that one or several industries do certainly profit by war. It will even be read in this report that a new and flourishing kind of business has been created since the two Balkan wars, that of artificial legs! But the main body of trade? The main body of the people? There is the whole question. On the one hand the increase of armaments leading inevitably to catastrophe, on the other emulation, economic competition leading to progress, always insufficient indeed, but better assured each day by general cooperation, and finally, to security.
Must we allow these two Balkan wars to pass, without at least trying to draw some lesson from them, without knowing whether they have been a benefit or an evil, if they should begin again tomorrow and go on for ever extending?
We have made up our mind. The objections that we have summarized are always the same, not one of them holds against the fact that the two Balkan wars, different as each was from the other, finally sacrificed treasures of riches, lives, and heroism. We can not authenticate these sacrifices without protesting, without denouncing their cost and their danger for the future. For this reason, I constituted our Commission, and today I am presenting the report which it has drawn up in truth, independence and complete disinterestedness.
These words, truth, independence and disinterestedness, are not vain words, Men of great worth and of the sincerest good will, have been ready to suspend the occupations of their ordinary life, in order to respond to our appeal, and have made their investigations in exceptional conditions of impartiality and authority, and with untiring courage. They did not allow themselves to be baffled by fatigue or difficulties of any kind, numerous as these were; not even by cholera, nor were they led astray by the least illusion. Before leaving Paris, each one of them knew that owing obedience to no one, to no word of command, to no party or government, to no journal, to no representation, Balkan or European; expecting no decoration, no reward of any sort, neither thanks nor compliments; coming after the brilliant scouts of the great press of all the great countries, after the prejudiced or sensational information seekers; serving, in a word, no particular interest, but a very general interest; that they would give full satisfaction to none, and would displease everybody more or less.Each one of them deliberately placed himself above suspicion, above
criticism, truly even above inevitable attack. It would be impossible to question the disinterestedness of the Commission, no member of it being remunerated, and the expenses of travel,-very modest indeed,-being publicly administered. But the Commission had to expect that objections would be made in refusing to acknowledge or in disqualifying some of its members. We knew all that. We took our precautions, not to avoid attacks, merely that they might be proved unjustifiable, and this is how I came to constitute our Commission. An ungrateful task, for which I have felt well rewarded, when I saw our work, in spite of troublesome presages and natural enough anxieties, coming none the less to a successful issue.
First, I consulted the men in Paris whom I consider to be masters of the question, Victor Berard to begin with, whose experience and knowledge are equal to his devotion; and that is no small thing to say. I should have liked him to be one of us, and I have in any case to thank him for much advice of which we took advantage. I would also have liked to be able to add to our number our admirable and regretted F. de Pressense and those of our valiant comrades of the struggle of 1903, of whom I have spoken. On his side, our friend President Nicholas Murray Butler is surrounded by men of generous sympathy, who form a phalanx, in the United States, of combatants always ready for the crusades of our own day, and he keeps us in constant touch with their views, aspirations and opinions.President Butler's collaborator, appointed to go to the Balkans, was Mr. Samuel T. Button, Professor at Columbia University, to whose impartiality and high moral integrity, I can pay no better tribute than by saying that he was not only a valiant fellow worker but an arbiter as well.I could say the same of Mr. Justin Godart, Deputy of Lyons, a politician of energy, accuracy and determination, whose rectitude can never be called in question even by his adversaries. The services rendered us by Mr. Godart were innumerable. Aside from the valuable part he took, like Mr. Dutton, in drawing up the report, he consented during the long journey through the Balkans to fulfil many other functions equivalent to those of president of the itinerary,-because the admirably united Commission over which I presided from Paris, had not thought it necessary to designate a vice president during its journey,-secretary general, treasurer, and reporter. Mr. Godart was all this and more, the trusted friend in whom every one could place reliance.
Two of our friends in Germany responded to our invitation, Professor Paszkowski of Berlin University, and Professor Schuecking of Marburg, both proved and excellent men, as impartial as they are enlightened. The former, just at the moment of his departure, was unfortunately refused the necessary permission by the University authorities. The latter was stopped at Belgrade, and was, I am bound to say, totally misled, owing to circumstances of which I will add a word or two later.
Austria contributed in default of Professor H. Lammasch, our great and generous friend, whose health kept him at home, Professor Redlich, whose cooperation both in Vienna and Paris, has been invaluable.
Mr. Francis W. Hirst of England, editor of the Economist, well known fo his noble campaigns for international conciliation, and the high integrity o his character, together with his distinguished colleague, Mr. H. N. Brailsford was constantly present at our preparatory meetings in Paris. Mr. Brailsford was appointed with Messrs. Dutton, Schuecking and Godart, to make one of the subcommittee which we decided to send to the scene of war.
From Russia, our friend Professor Maxime Kovalevsky and others were unsparing in their assistance. They were, in Europe, as Messrs. Root and Butler in the United States, the guarantors of the independence of the Commission. All our Russian friends were of the same opinion as ourselves in considering that the man best able to represent them, was Professor Paul Milioukov, member of the Douma, who gladly responded to their pressing invitation, as he did to ours. Professor Milioukov adds to his political authority the distinction of being a scholar who not only knows the Balkan nations thoroughly, but their languages as well. He has been reproached for this, and so has Mr. Brailsford. Professor Milioukov was at once denounced as being violently hostile to the Servians, Brailsford as not less hostile to the Greeks, It is true that by way of balance I was represented as an impenitent Philhellene, Hirst as a Sectarian, and Kovalevsky as something still worse. Godart and Dutton alone escaped all criticism.
I am aware of course from experience that in the Balkans as in some other countries, that I know of, it is impossible to avoid the reproach of a party, if one does not take sides with it against the others, and conversely. Milioukov was perfectly just to the Bulgarians when we in Europe were all unanimous in praising and upholding them. Later on he blamed them, as we all did. He censured the fault of the Servians when censure was unanimous, as he denounced the offenses of the Turks and of the Greeks. But he also paid sincere tribute, to their merits, as he did to the merits of the Greeks and the Turks. His only sin, in the eyes of each, was his perfect impartiality. He was nobody's man, precisely what we were looking for. Brailsford, on the other hand, had been frankly partisan, but for whom? For the Greeks. He took up arms for them and fought in their ranks, the true disciple of Lord Byron and of Gladstone; and in spite of this fact, today Brailsford is held to be an enemy of Greece. Why? Because, passionately loving and admiring the Greeks, he has denounced the errors that bid fair to injure them, with all the heat and vigor of a friend and of a companion in arms. This did not seem to be a sufficient motive for demanding his resignation. As we could not condemn Brailsford for being at one and the same time, both the friend and the enemy of Greece, we kept him, and have been very fortunate in so doing.
At last our Commission was constituted, advised on all points, and ready to start on its journey. Before its departure, I notified the Turkish Ambassador of its existence and of its purpose, and also the three ministers in Paris of Bulgaria, Greece and Servia, formerly among my most distinguished colleagues. Only the Greek Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the beginning, made some reservations to which I replied, concerning the choice of Brailsford, accused of being a Bulgarophile.
Thus prepared, we were assured that our inquiry, even if it did not please everyone, could not be regarded with suspicion, nor, in any case, stopped by anyone. The instructions accepted both by the sedentary members of the Commission and those delegated to go to the Balkans, are summarized in the following extract of the letter I wrote August 21, to Mr. Justin Godart and his companions:
* * * Sceptics will ask you what you expect to do? You can reply that you intend to obtain some light,-a little light,-and this will be much. A little light means appeasement and progress.
Your mission has as much economic as moral significance. When you return and publish your opinions, which I hope will be unanimous and which will certainly have the greater authority in that they are exceptionally disinterested, you will contribute to the better understanding in both hemispheres, of a very simple truth. That is, that these unhappy Balkan States have been up to the present, the victims of European division much more than of their own faults. If Europe had sincerely wished to help them in the past thirty years, she would have given them what makes the life in a country, that is, railways, tramways, roads, telegraphs and telephones, and in addition, schools. Once these fertile countries were linked to the rest of Europe, and connected like the rest of Europe, they would of themselves become peaceful by means of commerce and trade and industry, enriching themselves in spite of their inextricable divisions.
Europe has chosen to make them ruined belligerents, rather than young clients of civilization, but it is not yet too late to repair this long error. You are the precursors of a new economic order, exceedingly important for each one of the governments; you will be, because you claim no such distinction and because of your disinterestedness, the auxiliaries of their salvation. After having verified the evil which is only too evident, you will assist each government in repairing it, by making known by your report the real aims and resources of the country. And thus you will reassure the public which never likes to despond, and which will not admit that even a small part of Europe must lie fallow, when it can share the general progress which is going on feverishly everywhere else.
I hope that you will be able to suggest these views when you are conversing with such personages as you have occasion to meet. It is to the interest of each government that prejudicial legends should not be spread abroad. You will be able to confer a great benefit upon each of them.
Our Commission will upon its return, publish both in Europe and in America, a report which will be translated, widely circulated and commented upon. This report will contain, not the recital, but the confirmation and correction of facts already published. We are inclined to add to this a brief statement of the situation, drawn up by those specially interested in regard to the past, the present, and the future.
The impartial juxtaposition of these diverse statements in the same international document, will be a powerful means of serving the truth and of disproving the accusation of injustice on our part.
Our conclusions will then follow, and these conclusions can not be anything but one more effort to reduce the disorders from which all the world suffers, and to establish confidence where at present there is only discouragement and anxiety.
The Commission left Paris on August 2, stopped at Vienna, where Professor Paszkowski of Berlin and Professor Redlich were waiting for them, and then continued on to Belgrade. There began difficulties which need not be exaggerated. The Servian government could have taken either of two extreme courses. The first, which it did not adopt, consisted in itself supplying the Commission, as we asked it to do, with its own version of the events, and at the same time with a statement of the economic resources of its country. It knew that these statements would be published fully and impartially in our report. It had an excellent opportunity by so doing, of confounding its enemies and of instructing its friends, and what is more, of making Servia known to the world at large. I must confess that I could not understand its rather ungracious refusal, which we may call diplomatic, in order to offend no one. I know very well the reproaches directed against Mr. Milioukov; but Mr. Milioukov was not the whole Commission. They had the right to decline his testimony. That of the other members of the Commission then became of more value; it constituted a recourse. To speak quite fairly, the Commission came at the wrong moment to Belgrade; but I wonder if, in analogous circumstances, the governments of the great countries would not be more summary and intolerant than the Servian government. The matter stood thus: The Commission arrived at Belgrade just at the moment of the triumphant return of the army, a triumph both sad and glorious, when the sight of the line of victors woke in the silent crowds as much sorrow as pride. Servia's great losses in the two wars must be taken into consideration, all the splendid youth and strength she sacrificed with unheard-of courage, the blood spilt not only to secure independence, but in a struggle of brother against brother, a struggle where victory itself means mourning. We must take into consideration too, there as elsewhere, the excitement of frenzied jingoist journals.
The second course consisted simply in stopping our Commission. There were both pretexts and means: transports requisitioned by the army, interminable
delays, the uncertainty of communication, the bad state of sanitation, fear of cholera. * * * In the interests of the Commission itself, a government, without being- entirely hostile or insincere, could have obliged it to retrace its steps. The ministry at Belgrade did nothing of the kind; it refused to communicate with the Commission and entirely ignored it, although its arrival had been announced both from Paris and upon reaching Belgrade, to the Minister of Foreign Affairs. An official communication of September 7, explains the government's attitude, [The press is authorized to announce that the Servian government declares categorically pat it has never been hostile to an investigation, but that, on the contrary, it desires the iquiry of an impartial commission into the Bulgarian cruelties from which the Servians nd the Greeks have so greatly suffered. It is entirely to the interest of both Greece and ervia that the civilized world should know of the Bulgarian atrocities. If therefore, the ork of the Commission has miscarried, the cause must be sought for in one of its members, the declared enemy not only of Servia but of Greece, well known for what he has lid against her, not only in speech but in writing. Moreover, the Commission has never ade itself known until it presented itself here. No country could tolerate as a member a Commission a man whose partiality and animosity are only too well known.] but as a matter of fact it did not prevent the Commission from remaining, in spite of a slight animosity provoked by some of the newspapers against Mr. Milioukov, nor of continuing on its way. The Commission was provided by the government with every facility for reaching the frontier and Salonica. This was a good deal and I will do it so much justice. I do lot consider either that the Servian government was responsible for the attempts which were made to prevent our German colleague. Professor Schuecking, from rejoining the Commission. In this connection, some strange maneuvers took place. Professor Paszkowski, being, as I said, detained at the last moment, Professor Schuecking was named hurriedly to take his place. He was then at Ostend, from whence he set out with praiseworthy dispatch and devotion, but he could not reach Belgrade until some time after the Commission had already left for Salonica. What happened then? Who is to be blamed ? One fact emerges: Professor Schuecking was persuaded that there was nothing for him to do but go home; that the Commission had disbanded and had given up its work. Naturally enough Professor Schuecking returned home, and only heard the truth from me when he was back in his own country.
The government of Greece was anxious above all things to base its attitude on that of its ally in Belgrade. The Commission was therefore welcomed under the strictest reservations. At first, Mr. Dragoumis, the Governor of Salonica, informed the Commission that, following the example of Servia, his government declined to acknowledge Mr. Milioukov, but that all the members of the Commission should have entire liberty of action.Then Mr. Brailsford in his turn and even more directly, was refused; his liberty was restricted to the point of twice trying to prevent him from going to Kilkich, which efforts of the authorities met with the congratulations of the press.
asked itself if it should continue its work? It decided, strong in its independence and good faith, with the entire approbation of its President, not to discontinue, but to pursue its inquiry by all its means, where official aid failed it. The Commission has never ceased to protest, always with dignity, against the accusations of partisanship made against two of its members, and has never been divided for a single moment. The strength of its unity, so often and so roughly tested, will suffice to do away with any suspicion against its impartiality. Never for an instant were any of its members animated by the least desire to gather facts for prosecution against any particular people or State. On the contrary, they all desired to report nothing but the truth.They tried for instance, to get the replies of the Greeks and Servians to the accusations of the Bulgarians.
It must be recalled that the Greeks welcomed with courtesy and kindness, the member of the Commission who was sent to Athens, while the others remained in and about Salonica. Indeed all these things must be taken into serious consideration, when one thinks of the previous passions ruling in the unhappy country; of the daily violence exchanged morning and night between the papers; of the towns reduced to ruins; of the thousands of human beings wandering without refuge or aim; of the death, blood and crime crying everywhere for vengeance; of the Te Deums rising from churches whose very possession was disputed by rival fanaticisms.
In spite of all, the Commission did not abandon its voluntary task, impeded or not. It was not stopped, and one by one accomplished the different steps of the journey, from Belgrade to Salonica, to Athens, to Constantinople, to Sofia, from Servia to Greece, to Macedonia, to Turkey, to Thrace, to Bulgaria. The investigation required five weeks.On September 28, it returned to Paris, where it was joined by the other members who had given their authorization, and here they planned together the broad lines of the report which has required nearly a year to draw up, translate and publish.
The preparation and publication of the report has cost more time and trouble than we expected, but happily what might have been a difficulty, complete harmony between all the members of the Commission proved to be a simple matter. The plan of the work once set on foot,-the historical chapter taking the place of a general introduction,-each of the members who had personally taken part in the journey, was entrusted according to his special ability with one or two chapters, under the collective responsibility of the Commission. This explains why no chapter is signed by its author, the Commission continuing up to the end to be animated by the same spirit of unity and the same ambition for truth. Each of the authors and the office of the Commission revised the proofs sent across continents at the cost of a good many complications. The
commission meeting in Paris has acted as a reading committee, and chosen the pictures, few in number, to be published, avoiding as much as possible,-though it was no easy matter,-a vulgar collection of horrors. It was not desirable, however, to eliminate these completely, and they appear in the report as specimens, often incomplete, of the illustrations published wholesale by the newspapers. The report is followed by an appendix which the Commission would gladly have made more complete. There we had hoped to publish the official communications and protestations of the Greek and Servian governments, as well as their statistics giving the numbers of the killed, wounded and lost, and the estimate of material losses. It is not our fault, if these documents do not terminate our report, but in default of governmental information, veracious and verified information has not been wanting, as will be seen. The execution of the maps both in the text and apart from it, without which many pages of our report would be difficult to read, was carried out under the direction of e geographers, Messrs. Schrader and Aitoff. The editing of the index and the typographical correction of the proofs were entrusted to the personnel of our Paris office. The main divisions of the report forced themselves on our plan: first the causes of the two wars; then the theater of operation; the actors in the drama; the medley of nationalities engaged; the inevitable violation, or rather the non-existence of an international law in the anarchy of men and of things; finally the economic and moral consequences of the two wars, and the possible prospects for the future.
Nothing could be more necessary than the first chapter on the causes of the two wars. It was the prelude and the indispensable statement of affairs, not only for those who do not know but for those who know more or less but who forget. If our report contained nothing but this full and serious expose, at once scholarly and equitable, its publication would be amply justified. We recommend those of our readers who assert that some of our members are actuated by pro-Bulgar sympathies, to read the pages in which is unfolded, from the conquest of the Turks and their taking of Constantinople, the fatality of the acts which led to the two last wars, among these acts, the outburst of folly, the unbridled militarism against the popular will. We draw attention to the aberration of the Commander-in-Chief of the Bulgar army, General Savov, who became the leader of a military party, and his monstrous outrage which calls everything into question, makes a holy war into a butchery, turns the heroes into brutes, who in short, by himself and in spite of Europe, precipitates the second war and its unknown tomorrows. This chapter seemed to me like a mirror faithfully reflecting a mass of complications, sometimes discouraging for the historian and still more so for the diplomat, but edifying for whoever attempts to protect his country from adventurers. One sees clearly in it the fundamental distinction which we never cease making, between the war of ration and the war of conquest, between patriotism and crime.
The second chapter is both painful and absorbing. Here we shall be reproached for not taking sides. Here we ought to have said to each of the belligerents following the example of their press: "All the wrong is on the other side. The glory is entirely yours, the shame belongs only to the others."
There is to be seen what must be thought of these official classifications which pretend, in this horrible confusion where "God himself would not recognize his own," to assemble all the good under the same flag and all the bad under another. There is to be seen how the war kindled by intrigue, begins with the generosity of youth, to terminate without distinction of race, in the unloosing of the human beast. It is useless to dwell upon these massacres which we can not pass over in silence. I do not know whether an ideal war has ever existed, but it is time that the world should know what war really means. All the poet-laureates, the ephemeral glorifiers of these infamies whose authors we are commanded not only to absolve but to admire, and to hold up as examples to our children, all the crowd of officious writers are there to counterbalance our report, and to praise what we are determined to denounce in the interests of nations which require to be enlightened in regard to themselves.
Chapter III is not less lamentable, less harrowing, or less necessary, just because it will be more disagreeable to those who do not wish the truth to be known. Here the Greeks and the Bulgarians are no longer alone on the scene, the Turks and the Servians show what they can do. Here again, the Bulgarians are not spared more than the others; but the others have their share too. They will protest, they will reflect, and their reflections will do them more good than lying eulogy.
Chapter IV again holds up the mirror to an inextricable situation which must nevertheless be understood. Under the title "The War and the Nationalities," it discloses an excess of horrors that we can scarcely realize in our systematized countries, war carried on not only by armies but by mobilized gangs, and in reality by the medley of nations; local populations being "divided into as many fragments as there are nations fighting each other and wanting to substitute one for another. * * * This is the reason why so much blood was spilt in these wars. The worst atrocities were not due to the regular soldiers. * * * The populations themselves killed each other." Whoever wishes to judge of the evil and to look for more than the appearance of a remedy should meditate over this fourth chapter, and study the maps before forming too severe a judgment upon these competitions of horrors, and condemning as culprits peoples who turn and turn about, for centuries past have been crushed down.
Chapter V, "The War and International Law," is not less impartial than the preceding. Its conclusion is this: Every clause in international law relative to war on land and to the treatment of the wounded, has been violated by all the belligerents, including the Roumanian army, which was not properly speak-
ing belligerent. Public opinion has made great progress on this question of late years. I confess that in my ardent participation in the two Hague Conferences, the conventions fixing the laws and customs of war, interested me infinitely less than those organizing arbitration, mediation and good will, which tended in fact to prevent war, and not to humanize it. To humanize war seemed to me then a hypocrisy and a satire, leading to its being too easily accepted, but since then I have recognized my error. War is not declared by those who carry it on. The armies are only instruments in the hands of the governments; and these armies are recruited among the youth of each country. We at least owe to them to spare them sufferings which they have not brought upon themselves. To refuse to humanize war for fear of making it too frequent, is to let the weight of the governments' fault fall upon the soldier. In short, whatever amelioration diplomatic conferences can bring about in the horrors of war, it could never be enough. The torture of criminals is now suppressed. Should it exist-and what torture!-for soldiers and for hostile populations?The Commission has done its duty in contending that in spite of the Hague Conventions, the cruelty and ferocity and the worst outrages remained in the Balkans, the direct heritage of slavery and war.
Chapter V suggests as a subject worthy of the deliberations of the Third Hague Conference, the constitution of a permanent international commission, named in advance, and empowered in case of war to go and observe the application of its resolutions which the belligerents themselves have signed. This innovation, precisely because it would have too much reason for existence, will run a great risk of being considered indiscreet. It deserves more than to be passed over from prejudice.
We shall make a pause at Chapter VI. In an atmosphere of high and serene impartiality, the author contemplates the economic consequences of the war, and he concludes that in spite of appearances, it has been, apart from evil actions, because he does not desire to injure anyone, a bad and evil thing for every one, with the exception of course of the contractors who supplied the arms and ammunition, and the makers of wooden legs. Greece herself who is said to have made the maximum of possible gains, with the minimum of losses, because she was relatively far from the theater of war, even Greece has seen her national debt doubled. It is true that she will be able to retrieve her sacrifices by the new resources which she will draw from the islands and territories that are now part of her domain, but this is just where the question arises for her, as well as for all conquerors, even the happiest: Will the resources of which she assures herself, suffice to meet not only the expenses of the land improvement which her statesmen are unquestionably able to undertake, but also the military expenditure corresponding to her new ambitions? Here is Greece involved more deeply than she expected in the construction of armaments, competing with Italy, exposed in her turn to the temptation, to the
fascination of dreadnoughts. For this hundreds of millions of capital will have to be borrowed, taxes imposed to pay the contributors, to say nothing of the always increasing cost of maintenance and consequent temptations, because a young nation whatever the wisdom of its rulers may be, will not easily resign itself to let its armaments, on land and sea become, as they do, old fashioned in a very few years, without having made use of them; it will not let its men of war lie at anchor and its soldiers remain idle in barracks. What will happen then? Greece, the beautiful, will in her turn, be torn between the militarists on the one side who proclaim their patriotism at every opportunity by means of their journals and the voices of their impatient orators, and, on the other side by the party in favor of industry, of progress, seeing itself discredited while the sources of national riches are drained, and social revolt is engendered. * * * Greece is now going to discover how much it costs to abandon herself to the luxury of dreadnoughts. She is as yet only at the beginning. As to the other allies, and the Turks, we shall refrain from insisting upon their losses, which were very much greater, than those of Greece, or upon the dangers that threaten their future. These are only too apparent.
The moral consequences of the Balkan wars are briefly indicated in the chapter which completes the report. In it may be found the long reverberation of the many crimes as disastrous for their authors as for their victims and their respective countries. We are shown millions of human beings systematically degraded by their own doing, corrupted by their own violence. It gives us a good example of the evil which elsewhere we strive to denounce and to combat, by showing us how the generations of tomorrow are corrupted by the heritage of their forefathers, and the young men taken from the necessary and urgent work of the farm and the workshop to be placed in the comparative idleness of barracks, to wait for the next war. All these apprehensions for the future are expressed without the slightest trace of animosity against one or other of these unhappy and misguided nations, but rather with a feeling of profound sympathy for them and for humanity. The conclusion of the chapter evolves itself definitely: violence carries its own punishment with it and something very different from armed force will be needed to establish order and peace in the Balkans.
Never was a lesson clearer and more brutal. United, the peoples of the Balkan peninsula, oppressed for so long, worked miracles that a mighty but divided Europe could not even conceive. Crete, Salonica, Uskub, even Scutari and Adrianople they took, and after a few months they almost entered Constantinople. It was the end, the Gordian knot was cut. Disunited, they were forced to come to a standstill and to exhaust themselves further in their effort to begin again, an effort indefinitely prolonged. For, far from being a solution,
the second war was only the beginning of other wars, or rather of a continuous war, the worst of all, a war of religion, of reprisals, of race, a war of one people against another, of man against man and brother against brother. It has become a competition, as to who can best dispossess and "denationalize" his neighbor. The Turks in any case remain in Europe. The hecatombs of the siege of Adrianople have been in vain; Macedonia, no longer a tomb, has become a hell. Thrace is torn in pieces. Albania erected into a principality, remains the most unhappy and the wildest object of the eager watching of Austria, Servia, Montenegro, Greece and Italy. The churches and the Christian schools are fighting among themselves, enjoying less liberty than under Ottoman rule. Constantinople, more than ever, will be the eternal apple of discord under the surveillance of the Russians, who are themselves under the surveillance of Germany, Austria Hungary and Roumania, in fact of all the Powers, friends, allies and enemies. Greater Greece, Greater Bulgaria, and Greater Servia, the children of contemporary megalomania, will in their turn keep a close watch over the Bosphorus. The islands bring on a contest between Turkey and Asia on one hand, and Italy, Greece, England and all the great European Powers on the other. The Mediterranean open to new rivalries, becomes again the battlefield which she had ceased to be.
A dark prospect, which however, might become brighter if Europe and the great military Powers so wished. They could, in spite of everything, solve the problem if they were not determined to remain blind.
The real struggle in the Balkans, as in Europe and America, is not between oppressors and oppressed. It is between two policies, the policy of armaments and that of progress. One day the force of progress triumphs, but the next the policy of rousing the passions and jealousies that lead to armaments and to war, gets the upper hand.
With the second Balkan war, the policy of armaments spreads more strongly than ever. After having been the resource of European governments, it is about to become their punishment.
A paradoxical situation! The competition of armaments could not go on indefinitely, at this time of open economic competition between all the peoples of the Old World and the New. Already by reason of the increase of our budgets, and in spite of desperate efforts, it is losing prestige in popular opinion. It is being questioned, and consequently condemned.The extravagance of armaments appears like the development of a monstrous business, incompatible with national work. In spite of all the workmen that it employs, the salaries it pays, the auxiliary activities it supports, the war trade only flourishes by universal insecurity, lives only upon the increase of public expense, by all of which the normal business of all countries suffers. Under this regime of armed peace, only the little countries or the new countries are favored, those which have no debts, no immense war budgets.
What finally succeeds in bringing armed peace into disrepute, is that today the Great Powers are manifestly unwilling to make war. Each one of them,. Germany, England, France and the United States, to name a few, has discovered the obvious truth that the richest country has the most to lose by war,. and each country wishes for peace above all things. This is so true that these two Balkan wars have wrought us a new miracle,-we must not forget it,- namely, the active and sincere agreement of the Great Powers who, changing their tactics, have done everything to localize the hostilities in the Balkans and have become the defenders of the peace that they themselves threatened thirty-five years ago, at the time of the Berlin Congress. We might be tempted to attribute this evolution of public opinion and that of the governments in part to the new education which we are striving to spread, but let us stick to facts:
The exigencies of the universal competition, the increased means of communication, the protest of tax payers, and the dread of socialism and of the unknown, have been more efficacious in forcing the governments to think than any exhortations.
If this is so, why not end it? That is the dream, but how to realize it? Every one ignores it. A large body of persons, possessing immense capital, is engaged in the manufacture of armaments; more still, a formidable plant which must be sunk has been created and continues to be created every day. Is there anyone who will ignore this accumulation of strength and of riches? Who will be able to stop short this impulse? True, the home market is overstocked in every country with orders for armaments. Neither the jingo papers nor those in the hands of the federation of military contractors, who are so admirably organized into national and international syndicates, can urge indefinitely for a national consummation. There comes a time when public opinion refuses to submit any longer to this so-called patriotic regime; and the war trade, inspired with new ambition, turns its attention towards exportation. As the home market is not sufficient, a foreign market is created. The war trade believes that the foreign policy of a great nation is first and foremost the policy of armaments. The main duty of diplomacy according to it, is the struggle as to who shall carry off from a great rival nation, such and such a contract for guns, cannon or ironclads, and who shall subordinate political interventions or loans of money to army contracts.
The struggles become Homeric conflicts of influence and intrigue. Ambassadors can not disregard them without a kind of abdication. Has not even the Emperor of a great neighboring country made it a point of honor to militarize Turkey?-without any great success it is true. But what of Turkey or the colonies or the small states of few resources? An effort has been made to militarize North and South America, and Australia as well. Canada, whose future lies precisely in her exemption from all military burdens, has been forced to order a fleet from England, and to extract from a population still insufficient,
the elements of a navy which they have done very well without for a hundred years! Australia has not hesitated. Brazil, the Argentine, Chile and the other republics of South America did resist, thus giving Europe an example of peaceful cooperation; but now their former good sense has been overcome by attempts of all sorts continually repeated.Commercial travelers in patriotism have hurried from every corner of Europe to demonstrate the necessity for ordering the biggest battleships possible. We may recall the extraordinary experience of Brazil, the first dupe of these campaigns, when her great "Armada" arrived from the English ship yards and she saw it make its first attempt to cannonade Rio de Janeiro! It was the beginning of disillusion, the mastodon killed by ridicule. Since then, the propaganda of armaments has declined, even in the United States, where, however, the yellow press, typical of its kind, has given its proofs and is agitating the matter again, thanks to the providential events in Mexico. In the last few years, the House of Representatives at Washington has refused to vote more than one ironclad against two. In Germany, the Krupp case, the Saverne events, and many other incidents, without speaking of the Berne Conference, have been the answer to the furious excitement of the pan-Germanic press. In Japan itself there has just burst the unprecedented scandal of the naval contracts.
Russia nevertheless, happily for the great war trade, forgets how much the disasters of her navy have cost, and once more has allowed herself to be imposed upon. Austria has capitulated too, even Spain asks nothing better than to be persuaded, inasmuch as she can afford it. But on the whole the enthusiasm was cooling when the practice of the new Balkan States came to renew it. The acclamations of the jingo press of all countries greeted these fortunate countries, new centers for imports.
Even the battleships with which Brazil and the Argentine are disgusted, are being handed over to Turkey and Greece. Constantinople will become a vast arsenal and a naval port, worthy of her name and her past. The Greek fleet will oblige Italy, whose ardor was declining, to increase her navy as well; and following this example, the great countries of Europe and America will not remain unaffected. The naval leagues will agitate, the embassies will report these imposing manifestations, by sending confidential despatches, communicated as soon as received to the leading papers. Patriotic speakers, in print and on the platform, will inveigh against the "lie of pacifism," and so the prediction of the Americans that "the next war will be declared by the press," will be realized.
Then the Greeks, the Turks, the Servians, the Bulgarians, the Montenegrins and the Albanians, armed to the teeth, provided with all the guns and all the dreadnoughts for which we have no further use, can kill each other once more, and even drag into their quarrel the European governments, who will be as they themselves are, victims of the press and commercial patriotism, or in other words, of the policy of armaments.
sole resource while waiting for the day when we shall see the rise of an independent press, is our duty of speaking the truth which even the most sensible people hesitate to admit, for fear of compromising themselves.
In one of the speeches that I made in the Senate to free my conscience, before an audience sympathetic at heart, but fully determined not to support me, I calculated that France has imposed upon herself more than a hundred billion francs in unproductive expenditure during the last forty-three years, an average of more than two billion francs a year. This is the minimum price of armed peace for one country only. Several hundreds of billions in a half century for the Great Powers together!!
Think what United Europe might have done with these millions, had she consecrated even half to the service of progress! Imagine Europe herself, not to speak of Africa and Asia, penetrated and regenerated by the pure air, in its most distant parts, of free intercourse, of education and security. Can we picture what might have been the position today of these unfortunate Balkan peoples, if their patrons, the Great Powers of Europe, had competed with each other in aiding them, in giving them roads, and railways, and waterways, schools, laboratories, museums, hospitals and public works!
The most suitable title for this report would have been, "Europe Divided and her Demoralizing Action in the Balkans," but taking it all round this might have been unjust.
The real culprits in this long list of executions, assassinations, drownings, burnings, massacres and atrocities furnished by our report, are not, we repeat, the Balkan peoples. Here pity must conquer indignation. Do not let us condemn the victims. Nor are the European governments the real culprits. They at least tried to amend things and certainly they wished for peace without knowing how to establish it. The true culprits are those who mislead public opinion and take advantage of the people's ignorance to raise disquieting rumors and sound the alarm bell, inciting their country and consequently other countries into enmity. The real culprits are those who by interest or inclination, declaring constantly that war is inevitable, end by making it so, asserting that they are powerless to prevent it. The real culprits are those who sacrifice the general interest to their own personal interest which they so little understand, and who hold up to their country a sterile policy of conflict and reprisals. In reality there is no salvation, no way out either for small states or for great countries except by union and conciliation.
It is not proposed in this chapter to enter exhaustively into a question on which there is a highly abundant literature already in existence, both in the various European and Balkan languages. The intention is simply to furnish the data indispensable to the reader who is interested in the work done by the Commission, though unfamiliar with the details of the questions at issue in the Balkan peninsula. Every page of the Report handles such a mass of ideas, facts and dates, which, though supposed to be generally known, are in fact not so, that it seemed impossible to plunge the reader at once in medias res. Those more familiar with things in the East may begin the Report at the next Chapter.
The actual course of events in the Balkans is a very close reproduction of the conditions existing previous to the arrival of the Turks in Europe. Then, as now, the Christian States were engaged in constant internecine strife for hegemony in the peninsula. Victory both in the tenth and again in the thirteenth century was with the Bulgarian State, which though still primitive in organization owed its temporary ascendancy to the conquests of a military chief.
Then in the twelfth and fourteenth centuries came the turn of the conquering Servians. Intermittently, the Byzantine Emperors recovered their preponderance in the peninsula. The various peoples who had occupied the different regions from the third to the sixth century, A. D. (the indigenous population, Greek Albanian, or Roumanian having been either driven out or assimilated) served only to swell the armies or figure in the imposing titles assumed by the autocrats of all these, Servians, Greeks, Bulgarians, Albanians, conjoined in a sort of Imperial organization, a "Great Servia" or "Great Bulgaria." The collapse of these ephemeral "Great" States produced no change in the ethnographic composition of the peninsula. Political structures fell and rose again without any attempt being made to fuse the populations into any sort of national whole. At that stage indeed the national idea was not as now closely connected with the State idea. The Bulgar, the Servian, the Wallachian, the Albanian remained Bulgarian, Servian, Wallachian or Albanian, throughout all the successive regimes; and thus the ancient ethnographic composition remained unaltered until the Turkish conquest came, leveling all the nationalities and preserving them all alike in a condition of torpor, in a manner comparable to the action of a vast refrigerator.
Even if the political constructions which followed one another and which were actually in conflict with one another at the advent of the Turks, had con-
tained in them the germs of nationalities, the Turkish regime would have ruthlessly stamped them out. The Turks unconsciously worked for their destruction in the most effective possible way. They banished or assimilated the ruling class, that is to say the warrior class, in the conquered countries. In the communes there remained no one but the village agriculturists, whose only ethical bond was that of religion. Here again the Turkish regime did much to reduce the ethnic and national significance of the religious element to its lowest terms. The religion of all the conquered nationalities being the same, i. e., Oriental orthodoxy, the Turks ended by recognizing only one clergy as representative of the rayas (creeds), the one chosen being the Greek clergy, the most cultivated and in the capital (Constantinople) the most prominent. The Phanar (the Greek quarter of Constantinople in which the Greek patriarchate is situated), finally became the sole orthodox church in Turkey; the last remains of the national autonomous churches which still existed at Okhrida (for the Bulgarians) and at Ipek (for the Servians) being abolished by the decrees of the Greek patriarchate of 1765 and 1767 respectively. Consequently, a common race name was given to the orthodox populations in the official language of the Turkish bureaucracy: they were all "Roimi-mileti," from the name, Romaics, of the Greek people. (This is the name the modern Greeks gave themselves down to recent times.)
Nevertheless, although the people were thus merged and submerged, national consciousness was not completely obliterated. There was always a certain discontent between the pastors and their flocks. The latter could not forget that they had formerly heard mass celebrated in their national language by a priest whom they chose themselves and whose interests were not limited to taxes and state service. The Greek priest, on his side, was expatriated in the midst of a Slav population; it was humiliating for a lover of the muses to dwell in a barbarian world, in the midst of "wearers of sheep skins." The conditions being so, any favorable circumstance, any spark from outside, would be enough to re-light 'the flame of nationality.
It is impossible in this too brief sketch to follow in detail the course of the reawakening of the national idea in the Balkans. It goes back to the earliest days of the Turkish conquest. The Servians and Roumanians, the last to be subdued by the Turks, were the first to claim their autonomy. What especially favored the development of national consciousness among the Servians was the large proportion of their race which had remained outside the Ottoman conquest. Even apart from the Servians on the Adriatic, who had been open to the influences of Italian literature since the sixteenth century, those in Austria Hungary had tasted European civilization long before the Servians in Turkey. Ragusa first, and afterwards Agram (in Slav "Zagreb") were intellectual centers of the Servian nation before Belgrade.
In Servia proper the struggle for independence preceded the intellectual development of the nation. While our Commission was in Belgrade a monument
was erected, in honor of the first liberator of Servia, the founder of the present dynasty, Kara-Georges, who more than a century ago (1804) organized the first resistance offered by the people to its Turkish masters. In the year 1813 the first insurrection was defeated; Kara-Georges fled to Austria, and was killed in 1817. But a new leader had already appeared in the person of the founder of the second Servian dynasty,-recently extinguished with Alexander and Draga, namely Michel Obrenovits, the son of a peasant, like Kara-Georges. The second insurrection, with Michel at its head, was more successful than the first. The convention of Akkerman (1826) secured Servia a sort of autonomy under Russian protectorate, and the Hatticherif of 1829 confirmed and completed the act by making Servia a hereditary principality under the Sultan's suzerainty. A year later another Hatticherif gave the Servians the right to establish primary schools; and by 1836 there were seventy-two of these in the principality.
Greece, at the other extremity of the peninsula, had closely followed Servia's example. There, too, effort at national revival outside the country went on contemporaneously with the endeavors at revolt on which the wild mountaineers ventured from time to time. These mountaineers are known by the picturesque appellation of "thieves" (Klephtai, patriotic thieves, in distinction to lestai, brigands pure and simple).
The liberty of Greece proclaimed by the national assembly at Epidaurus was not recognized until the Act of February 3, 1830. Then the bases of national civilization asserted since 1814 by members of the Philiki Heteria were formally laid down. We have already seen that thanks to the energy of the Phanar clergy, the Greek schools had maintained not existence merely but vitality, despite the Turkish rule, and sent out generations of educated Greeks.
This was not the fate of the countries in the interior - Bulgaria and Macedonia. It is true that the first indications of national consciousness appeared early, in the course of the eighteenth century. Down to 1840 they went on spreading in proportion to the increasing influence of foreign civilization (in the present case, of Russian civilization). It was not until 1852, however, that the first national Bulgarian school appeared, at Tirnovo. At the close of this period a movement in the direction of religious independence made itself felt. From 1860 on, a most bitter conflict broke out between the heads of the Bulgarian community at Constantinople and the Greek patriarchate, religion and nationality being identified on either side. Since Greek nationalism constituted a political danger for Turkey, while the Bulgarians had as yet formulated no political claim, their chiefs rather piquing themselves on their loyalty towards the Sultan, the Turkish authorities began to take sides against the Greeks in this national strife, and finally conceded to the Bulgarians the establishment of a national church subject to purely formal recognition of the patriarchal supremacy. This was the beginning of the Bulgarian exarchy, officially recognized by the Firman of 1870.
to accept the firman. The Bulgarians, supported by the Turks, retorted by electing their first exarch and making formal proclamation (May 11, 1872) of the independence of their church. Thereupon the patriarch, four months later, excommunicated the new church and declared it schismatic. This too hasty step served only to assist the Bulgarian cause. The Bulgarians having now secured what they desired, i. e; a church wholly independent of the Greeks and thoroughly national, both in its head and its members, proceeded to fix the dioceses of the new church. Some of these dioceses were actually enumerated in the firman: the exarchies of Bulgaria today; others, which were also to form part of the national church, were in accordance with Article 10 of the firman to be fixed by a vote of the population. [article X of the Firman of March 11, 1870. * * * "If the whole orthodox population or at least two-thirds thereof, desire to establish an exarchy for the control of their spiritual affairs in localities other than those indicated above, and this desire be clearly established, they may be permitted to do as they wish. Such permission, however, may only be accorded with the consent or upon the request of the whole population, or at least two-thirds thereof.] Accordingly the exarchate took a plebiscite, as laid down in Article 11, beginning with the provinces of Uskub and Okhrida. Since a more than two-thirds majority there declared against the Patriarch the Porte gave its berat (investiture) to the Bulgarian Bishops of Uskub and Okhrida.
But Okhrida and Uskub are Macedonian. The question of Macedonia had thus definitely arisen. It is true that before 1873 the Greeks had already contended for this region with the Slavs. But it had not yet occurred to the Slavs (Servians and Bulgarians) to dispute about it among themselves. The young radicals in Servia and Bulgaria who between 1860 and 1870 disseminated the notion of a Southern Slav Federation, accepted the proposition that the populations of Thrace and Macedonia were as Bulgarian as those of Bulgaria, as a settled fact, traditionally established. The Bulgarian publicist, Liouben Karavelov, wrote the following in 1869-70:
The Greeks show no interest in knowing what kind of people live in such a country as Macedonia. It is true that they say that the country formerly belonged to the Greeks and therefore ought to belong to them again * * * But we are in the nineteenth century and historical and canonical rights have lost all significance. Every people, like every individual, ought to be free and every nation has the right to live for itself. Thrace and Macedonia ought then to be Bulgarian since the people who live there are Bulgarians.
And his friend the Servian Vladimir Yovanovits on his side, regarded Bosnia, Herzegovina and Metchia as the only Servian lands in Turkey, that is Old Servia in the most limited sense of the term, which shows that he accepted the view of Macedonia as Bulgarian.
Yet there existed in Servia at this epoch a section of nationalist opinion which declared that Old Servia included the whole of Macedonia and claimed it as having
formed part of the "Great" Servia of the time of Douchan the Strong. These Servian nationalists did not confine themselves to polemics in the press: they began to organize schools in Macedonia, where the Servian masters were instructed to teach in literary Servian and employ text books written in Belgrade. Mr. Miloyevits, one of the leaders of this movement, tells us that in 1865 there was only one school in Macedonia proper founded by the Servians; in 1866 there were already as many as six; in 1867, 32; in 1868, 42. From that time on the Servian government became interested in these schools and began subsidizing them. The Macedonian population on the other hand received the schools willingly. Were not the schoolmasters Slavs who had come to Macedonia to fight the Greek influence? Soon, however, it appeared that the Servian teachers were there to carry on propaganda for their nationality. The Bulgarian press was roused, and from 1869 on a lively dispute followed.
The partisans of the "Yougo-Slav Federation" consoled themselves with the reflection that this Servian nationalist doctrine only represented the views of a small group of journalists and dilettante historians and ethnographers. But as we have seen, it had already secured the support of the State. Two circumstances contributed to accentuate this tendency: one, the organization of the new national Bulgarian church,-the exarchy; the other, the diplomatic check to Servia's hopes of an outlet on the Adriatic.
Mention has already been made of an early success of the exarchist church in Macedonia-the two berats sanctioning the bishoprics of Okhrida and Uskub. Other victories were to follow. The Greeks, who had considered Macedonia as their patrimony, naturally viewed them with disfavor. It occurred to them, as a means of withdrawing the attention of the Bulgarians from Macedonia, to suggest the extension of the Bulgarian ecclesiastical organization to the Servian countries, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The suggestion pleased the Bulgarians, but although they accepted the Greek proposition, they did not renounce their Macedonian pretensions. The list of the exarchist dioceses to be created became a long one, embracing as it soon did the whole of Macedonia, Old Servia, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Servian government could not regard such claims with indifference, since it was fully aware of the inseparability of the ideas of nationality and a national church. The Servian Ministry therefore pointed out that while the ethnographic nature of the Macedonian dioceses formed subject of discussion, those of Old Servia were indisputably Servian. If the Bulgarian dioceses wished to form an exarchist church, the dioceses of the ancient Servian provinces must, in their turn, recognize the head of the church of the Servian principality as their spiritual head. Here was the whole Macedonian conflict in germ. Even the tactics employed foreshadow the course of recent events.
Servia joined Greece against the Bulgarian exarchy. The Servians, fighting against the national Bulgarian church, chose to remain subject to the Greek pa-
triarch. He profited by this to impose Greek bishops upon them and persisted in giving a Greek denomination to their religious communities. Thus did the Servians in Turkey deprive themselves of their own free will of the most effective weapon in the national conflict. From this time on the "exarchist" was exclusively Bulgarian and the Macedonian population, called Boulgari from time immemorial, began to feel itself at once Bulgarian and Slav. Outside the national Bulgarian church, which thus remained the Slav church in Macedonia, there were only "patriarchists" of every kind-Greek, Wallachian or Servian united under one Greek ecclesiastical authority, that of Constantinople.
The second circumstance driving Servia to accentuate its Macedonian pretensions was the "occupation" of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria Hungary. It is now known that at the interview between Emperor Alexander II and Emperor Francis Joseph at Reichstadt on July 8, 1876, it was agreed that in the event of Servia or Montenegro winning independence, Austria Hungary should have the right to "occupy and administer" these provinces. The same terms were repeated in the Berlin treaty. At the same time Austria Hungary emphasized her assertion that she regarded Servia as within her sphere of influence.
At Reichstadt, Russia agreed not to make war on Servian territory, and when General Ignatiev suggested the annexation of Bosnia to the Austrian diplomats as the condition of recognition of the treaty of San Stefano, Count Andrassy replied by a counter proposition, that of leaving Russia full freedom of action in Bulgaria on condition of the proclamation of Macedonia's autonomy under Austro-Hungarian protection.
After the Berlin Congress, Austria Hungary entered into closer relations with King Milan of Servia. He signed the secret treaty of 1881, in which (§7) Austria Hungary formally declared that she "would not oppose, would even support Servia against other powers in the event of the latter's finding a way of extending its southern boundary, exception being made in the case of the Sandjak of Novi Bazar." In 1889, when this treaty was renewed, Austria ^Hungary promised in even clearer terms "to aid in the extension of Servia in the direction of the Vardar valley." Thus at the very moment when Austria Hungary was depriving Servia of any possibility of westward extension, by joining the section of the Servian population inhabiting- Bosnia and Herzegovina to herself, Austrian diplomacy was holding out by way of compensation, the hope of an extension towards the south, in those territories whose population had, up to 1860-1870, been universally recognized as Bulgarian, even by the Servians.
From this time on nationalism distinctly gained ground in Servia. The whole of Macedonia was identified with "Old Servia" and "Young Servia," m its map, claimed the entire territory occupied under the rule of Stephen Douchan, in the fourteenth century. At this period the net work of Servian schools spread specially fast, thanks to the aid of the Turks, who here as elsewhere followed their habitual policy of playing- off the Servian and Greek
minorities against the stronger and more dangerous majority of the Bulgarian exarchists. In 1889 the Servian school manuals were for the first time published at Constantinople with ministerial sanction and the Servian school soon ceased to be secret and persecuted. In 1895-96 according to official Servian statistics there were 157 schools with 6,831 scholars and 238 male and female teachers. It is, however, noteworthy that eighty of these schools, comprising 3,958 scholars and 120 male and female teachers were situated in Old Servia properly so-called, that is to say, that more than half of them belonged to countries which were undoubtedly Servian.
Here are the statistics for the Bulgarian-exarchist schools for the same period: there were in Macedonia 1896-97, 843 such schools (against 77 Servian schools), 1,306 teachers (Servian, 118) ; 31,719 scholars (Servian, 2,873); children in the kindergarten, 14,713.
These figures show that at the close of the nineteenth century the overwhelming majority of the Slav population of Macedonia was sending its children to the exarchist Bulgarian school. The school became henceforth an auxiliary of the national movement, and independent of the church. The movement changed both its character and its object. Side by side with the ecclesiastical movement led by priests and assisted by the religious council of the community, there arose about 1895 a revolutionary movement, directed against the Turkish regime, whose object was political autonomy and whose leaders were recruited from the school teachers. On the other hand the resistance of the minorities, supported by the Turks, grew more pronounced. "Patriarchism" and "exarchism" became the rallying cries of the two conflicting nations. From this time on the ethnographic composition of Macedonia was only to be elucidated by an enumeration of "exarchist" and "patriarchist" households-a most uncertain and fluctuating method since the strife grew more complicated, so that one and the same family would sometimes be divided into "Bulgarians," "Greeks," "Wallachians" and "Servians," according to the church attended by this or that member.
The new generation in Servia therefore - now sought a more reliable and scientific means of determining nationality, and found it in language. Youthful scholars devoted themselves to the study of Macedonian dialects and sought for phonetic and morphological traces of Servian influence which might enable them to be classified among Servian dialects. Bulgarian linguists, on their side did the same, and insisted on an essentially Bulgarian basis in the Macedonian dialects.
Official Turkish statistics admitted only one principle of discrimination between the ethnic groups dwelling in Macedonia, namely religion. Thus all the Mahomrnedans formed a single group although there might be among them Turks, Albanians, Bulgarian "pomaks," etc.: all the patriarchists in the same way were grouped together as "Greeks," although there might be among them Servians, Wallachians, Bulgarians, etc. Only in the "exarchist" group, did religion coincide, more or less, with Bulgarian nationality. The Turkish official registers included men only; women were not mentioned, since the registers served only for the purposes of military service and taxation. Often nothing was set down but the number of "households." This explains the lack of anything approaching exact statistics of the Macedonian populations. Owing to the different principles and methods of calculation employed, national propagandists arrived at wholly discrepant results, generally exaggerated in the interest of their own nationality. The table subjoined shows how great is this divergence in estimate and calculation:
The Bulgarian statistics alone take into account the national consciousness of the people themselves. The Servian calculations are generally based on the results of the study of dialect and on the identity of customs: they are therefore largely theoretic and abstract in character. The Greek calculations are even more artificial, since their ethnic standard is the influence exercised by Greek civilization on the urban populations, and even the recollections and traces of classical antiquity.
The same difficulties meet us when we leave population statistics and turn to geographical distribution. From an ethnographical point of view the population of Macedonia is extremely mixed. The old maps, from that of Ami Bone (1847) down, follow tradition in regarding the Slav population of Macedonia as Bulgarian. Later local charts make the whole country either Servian, or Greek. Any attempt at more exact delineation, based on topical study, is of recent date. There are, for example, Mr. Kantchev's maps, representing Bulgarian opinion, and the better known one of Mr. Tsviyits representing Servian. But Mr. Tsviyits' ethnographic ideas vary also with the development of Servia's political pretensions. In 1909 he gave "Old Servia" a different outline from that he gave in 1911 (see his map published in the "Petermann" series) ; and in the hour of Servian victory on the eve of the second Balkan war, another professor at Belgrade University, Mr. Belits, published his map, based on a study of dialects, a
map which satisfied the most recent and immoderate pretensions. The Servo-Bulgarian frontier recognized by the treaty of March 13 is plainly inspired by the ideas of Mr. Tsviyits, while the line drawn by Mr. Belits reveals and explains the causes of the breaking of the treaty and the war between the allies.
But we are anticipating. We must now return to the close of the nineteenth century to see two parallel and rival ideas ripening-the ideas of the autonomy and of the partition of Macedonia.
The part played by Russia in the liberation of Bulgaria is sufficiently well known. It is much less well known that this liberation was preceded in 1878 by a national movement on the spot. Of this we have spoken already in connection with the peaceful struggle carried on by the exarchate against the Phanariot Greeks. It was accompanied by a revolutionary movement whose aim was the independence of Bulgaria. As in Servia and in Greece at the beginning of the nineteenth century, the movement found allies among the semi-brigand, semi-revolutionary mountain chiefs, known as haidouks. The principal leaders, the "apostles" of the movement, however, were revolutionaries of a more modern type, intellectuals whose education had frequently been acquired in foreign schools and universities. The generation of the "apostles" declared against the older methods of conflict, the ecclesiastical methods adopted by the tchobadjis, or nabobs of the Bulgarian colony at Constantinople. The people were with the apostles, and the era of insurrections began, bringing in its train the Turkish atrocities which Gladstone revealed to the civilized world. The Macedonian Bulgarians shared in this movement as well as the Bulgarians of Bulgaria proper. It was quite natural that the close of the Russo-Turkish war should see arising the idea of an "undivided Bulgaria," conceived within the limits of the treaty of San Stefano and including all the populations in Turkey regarded by themselves as Bulgarian. The protestations of Servian nationalism were stifled by the Servians themselves, for they, like Mr. Verkovits, had recognized all the countries enclosed within the boundaries of the Bulgaria of the future, imagined by Count Ignatiev, as traditionally Bulgarian. [It should be added that the ethnographic boundaries of Bulgaria, including therein Macedonia, were, previous to the treaty of San Stefano, indicated in the Minutes of the Conference at Constantinople in 1876. (See the debates of December 11/23.) The treaty of San Stefano as agreed upon between Russia and Turkey was, as is known, modified in essential respects and remade by the Berlin agreement, which divided this ethnographic Bulgaria in three parts: (i) The principality of Bulgaria; (ii) The vassal province of Eastern Roumelia; (iii) The Turkish province of Macedonia.]
The fate of the treaty of San Stefano is familiar. The principality of Bulgaria was dismembered, and Macedonia remained in the hands of the Turks. This was the origin and cause of all subsequent conflicts. "Undivided Bulgaria," tsielo coupna Boulgaria, became in future the goal and the ideal of Bulgarian na-
tional policy. Turkey replied by favoring minorities. An internal conflict followed by the use of means of which the late war has given an appalling example. From this time on there was no more security in Macedonia. Each of the rival nations,-Bulgarian, Greek, Servian, counted its heroes and its victims, its captains and its recruits, in this national guerrilla warfare and the result for each was a long martyrology. By the beginning of 1904 the number of political assassinations in Macedonia had, according to the English Blue Book, reached an average of one hundred per month. The Bulgarians naturally were the strongest, their bands the most numerous, their whole militant organization possessing the most extensive roots in the population of the country. The government of
the Bulgarian principality had presided at the origination of the Macedonian movement in the time of Stefane Stamboulov (about 1895). There was, however, always a divergence between the views of official Bulgaria which sought to e the movement as an instrument in its foreign policy, and those of the revolutionaries proper, most of them young people enamored of independence and filled with a kind of cosmopolitan idealism.
The revolutionary movement in Macedonia has frequently been represented a product of Bulgarian ambition and the Bulgarian government held directly responsible for it. As a matter of fact, however, the hands of the government re always forced by the Macedonians, who relied on public opinion, violently
excited by the press, and the direct propaganda of the leaders. There certainly was a "Central Committee" at Sofia, whose president was generally someone who enjoyed the confidence of the prince. This committee, however, served chiefly as the representative of the movement in the eyes of the foreigner; in the eyes of the real leaders it was always suspected of too great eagerness to serve the dynastic ambitions of King Ferdinand. It was in Macedonia that the real revolutionary organization, uncompromising and jealous of its independence, was to be found. For the origins of this internal organization we must go back to 1893 when, in the little village of Resna, a small group of young Bulgarian intellectuals founded a secret society with the clearly expressed intention of "preparing the Christian population for armed struggle against the Turkish regime in order to win personal security and guarantees for order and justice in the administration," which may be translated as the political autonomy of Macedonia. The "internal organization" did not aim at the annexation of Macedonia to Bulgaria ; it called all nationalities dwelling in the three vilayets to join its ranks. No confidence was felt in Europe; hope was set on energetic action by the people. To procure arms, distribute them to the young people in the villages, and drill the latter in musketry and military evolutions-such were the first endeavors of the conspirators. All this was not long in coming to the notice of the Turks, who came by accident upon a depot of arms and bombs at Vinitsa. This discovery gave the signal for Turkish acts of repression and atrocities which counted more than two hundred victims. From that time on, there was no further halt in the struggle in Macedonia. The people, far from being discouraged by torture and massacre, became more and more keenly interested in the organization. In a few years the country was ready for the struggle. The whole country had been divided into military districts, each with its captain and militia staff. The central "organization," gathering force "everywhere and nowhere" had all the regular machinery of a revolutionary organization; an "executive police," a postal service and even an espionage service to meet the blows of the enemy and punish "traitors and spies." Throughout this period of full expansion, the people turned voluntarily to the leaders, even in the settlement of their private affairs, instead of going before the Ottoman officials and judges, and gladly paid their contributions to the revolutionary body. Self-confidence grew to such a point that offensive action began to be taken. The agricultural laborers tried striking against their Turkish masters for a rise in wages, to bring them up to the minimum laid down by the leaders of the "organization." They grew bolder in risking open skirmishes with the Turkish troops; and the official report of the "organization" records that as many as 132 conflicts (512 victims) took place in the period 1898-1902. At last European diplomacy stirs. The first scheme of reforms appeared, formulated by Russia and Austria in virtue of their entente of 1897. The Austro-Russian note of February, 1903, formulates demands too modest to be capable of solving the problem. The result was as usual; the Porte hastens to prevent European action
by promising in January to inaugurate reforms. The Macedonian revolutionaries are in despair. A little group of extremists detaches itself from the Committee to attempt violent measures such as might stir Europe; in June bombs were thrown at Salonica. On July 20 (old style) the day of St. Elie (Iline-den) a formal insurrection breaks out: the rayas see that they are strong enough to measure themselves against their old oppressors.
It is the climax of the "internal organization" and that of its fall. The heroism of the rebels breaks itself against the superior force of the regular army. The fighting ratio is one to thirteen, 26,000 to 351,000; there are a thousand deaths and, in the final result, 200 villages ruined by Turkish vengeance, 12,000 houses burned, 3,000 women outraged, 4,700 inhabitants slain and 71,000 without a roof. [We quote throughout from the official report of the "organization."]
The decadence of the "internal organization" begins here, with the usual consequences-demoralization and Jacobinism. Traitors are searched out, and to an increasing extent discovered and executed; funds are extorted and employed on private purposes instead of on the national conflict; forced idleness condemns men to a life of disorder and coarse pleasure. The first period of the struggle is at an end (1897-1904).
Now, however, the whole of Europe begins to interest itself in the affairs of Macedonia.The second period opens; it is marked by attempts to organize European control over the Turkish regime (1905-1907). Macedonian autonomy becomes the distant goal of diplomatic efforts. Gradually an understanding begins to be reached, as questions are taken one by one, and the attempt is made to reform Turkish administration, police, finance and justice in Macedonia.We need not linger over the details of this portion of Balkan history, for it is but too familiar. Generally speaking, it is the repetition, on a larger scale, of what had been going on for half a century. First, unreal concessions, then, as soon as they begin to become onerous, general reform on paper which sweeps away and slurs over all practical details; and finally, the moment of tension once over, and the attention of Europe averted, the old order once again-with the single difference that the concessions agreed upon this time were more important. The loss of a whole province seemed threatened. So the reaction was all the greater. Instead of the Hamidian constitution of 1876, here was a new one, imposed this time on the sovereign by the Young Turk Revolution. Reforms were imposed fin the name of the people]. The Great Powers had nothing more to do in Macedonia. They departed amid the joyous cries of the multitude, while the leaders of the different nationalities, only yesterday on terms of irreconcilable hostility, embraced one another. The last attempt at the reconstruction of the Ottoman State was about to begin; the third and last period of our history (1908-12).
Its opening was of very happy augury. Proclaimed to the strains of the Marseillaise, the young Turkish revolution promised to solve all difficulties
and pacify all hatreds by substituting justice for arbitrary rule, and freedom for despots. First and foremost it proclaimed complete equality as between the diverse nationalities inhabiting Turkey, in reliance on their Ottoman patriotism, their attachment to the vatan, to their fatherland one and indivisible. The partisans of Macedonian autonomy take up once more their hopes of reaching their end without alarming the susceptibilities of the dominant race. The revolutionaries and comitadjis of yesterday lay down their arms and go down from their mountains to the big towns; neither arms nor secret relations with the neighboring Balkan governments are any longer needed. Bulgarian Macedonians above all dream that they can now become good Ottoman patriots, while still faithful to their national ambitions.
It is a dream of but a moment's duration. The Young Turkish revolution proves itself from the very first narrow and nationalist. Far from satisfying the tendencies of re-awakening nationalism, it sets itself a task to which the absolutism of the Sultan had never ventured; to reconstruct the Turkey of the Caliphate and transform it into a modern state, beginning by the complete abolition of the rights and privileges of the different ethnic groups. These rights and privileges, confirmed by firmans and guaranteed by European diplomacy, were the sole means by which the Christian nationalities could safeguard their language, their beliefs, their ancient civilizations. These barriers once down, they felt themselves threatened by Ottoman assimilation in a way that had never been threatened before in the course of the ages since the capture of Constantinople by Mahomet II. This assimilation, this "Ottomanization," was the avowed aim of the victor, the committee of "Union and Progress."
Worse still: the assimilation of heterogeneous populations could only be effected slowly, however violent might be the measures threatening the future existence of the separate nationalities. The men of the Committee had not even confidence in the action of time. They wished to destroy their enemies forthwith, while they were still in power. Since national rivalries in Macedonia offered an ever-ready pretext for the intervention of the Powers, they decided to make an end of the question with all possible celerity. They were sure-and frequently stated their assurance in the Chamber-that the ancien regime was to blame for the powerlessness it had shown in Macedonia. They, on the other hand, with their new methods, would have made an end of it in a few months, or at most a few years.
Nevertheless it was the old methods that were employed. A beginning was made in 1909 by violating the article of the constitution which proclaimed the liberty of associations. The various ethnic groups, and especially the Bulgarians, had taken advantage of this article to found national clubs in Macedonia. As the pre-1908 revolutionary organizations had been dissolved by their heads, in their capacity of loyal Ottoman citizens, they had been replaced by clubs which had served as the nucleus of an open national organization. Their objective was now
electoral instead of armed conflict; and while secretly arming there was nevertheless a readiness to trust the Ottoman Parliament, to leave it to time to accomplish the task of regeneration and actual realization of constitutional principles. The Bulgarian revolutionaries had even concluded a formal agreement with the revolutionaries of the Committee of Union and Progress, according to which the return home of th2 insurgents was regarded as conditional only, and the internal organization only to be disbanded on condition that the constitution was really put in force.
The Committee once in power saw the danger of these national political organizations and entered on a systematic conflict with its allies of yesterday. From the spring of 1909 onwards, the partisans of the Committee caused the assassination one after another of all those who had been at the head of revolutionary bands or committees under the previous regime. In the autumn of 1909 the final blow was aimed at the open organizations. (The Union of Bulgarian constitutional clubs included at that moment sixty-seven branches in Macedonia.) In November, the Chamber passed an Association law which forbade "any organization based upon national denomination." An end was thus successfully put to the legal existence of the clubs, but not to the clubs themselves. Revolutionary activity began again from the moment when open legal conflict became impossible.
The Christian populations had good reasons for revolting against the new Turkish regime. Articles 11 and 16 of the revised constitution infringed the rights and privileges of the religious communities and national schools. The Ottoman State claimed to extend the limits of its action under the pretext of "protecting the exercise of all forms of worship" and "watching over all public schools." The principles might appear modern but in practice they were but new means for arriving at the same end-the "Ottomanization" of the Empire. This policy aimed at both Greeks and Bulgarians. For the Greeks, the violent enemies of the Young Turkish Movement from its beginning, it was the economic boycott declared by the Committee against all the Greeks of the Empire in retaliation for the attempts of the Cretans to reunite themselves with the mother country. It was forbidden for months that the good Ottomans should frequent shops or cafes kept by Greeks. Greek ships stopped coming into Ottoman ports, unable to find any laborers to handle their cargo.
Even more dangerous was the policy of Turkizing Macedonia by means of systematic colonization, carried out by the mohadjirs-emigrants, Moslems from Bosnia and Herzegovina. This measure caused discontent with the new regime to penetrate down to the agricultural classes. They were almost universally Bulgarian tenant farmers who had cultivated the tchifliks (farms) of the Turkish beys from time immemorial. In the course of the last few years they had begun to buy back the lands of their overlords, mainly with the money many of them brought home from America. All this was now at an end. Not only had the purchase of their holdings become impossible; the Turks began turning the ten-
ants out of their farms. The government bought up all the land for sale to establish mohadjirs (Moslem refugees from Bosnia) upon it.
This was the final stroke. The leaders of the disarmed bands could now return to their mountains where they rejoined old companions in arms. The "internal organization" again took up the direction of the revolutionary movement. On October 31, 1911, it "declared publicly that it assumed responsibility for all the attacks on and encounters with the Turkish army by the insurgents in this and the previous year, and for all other revolutionary manifestations." The Young Turkish Government had not waited for this declaration to gain cognizance of revolutionary activity and take action upon it. So early as November, 1909, it had replied by an iniquitous "band" law, making the regular authorities of the villages, all the families where any member disappeared from his home, the whole population of any village harboring a comitadji, responsible for all the deeds and words of the voluntary, irregular associations. In the summer of 1910 a systematic perquisition was instituted in Macedonia with the object of discovering arms hidden in the villagers' houses. The vexations, the tortures to which peaceful populations were thus subjected can not possibly be enumerated here. In November, 1910, Mr. Pavlov, Bulgarian deputy, laid the facts before the Ottoman Parliament. He had counted as many as 1,853 persons individually subjected to assault and ill treatment in the three Macedonian vilayets, leaving out of account the cases of persons executed en masse, arrested and assaulted, among whom were dozens killed or mutilated. Adding them in, Mr. Pavlov, brought his total up to 4,913. To this number were still to be added 4,060 who had taken refuge in Bulgaria or fled among the mountains to escape from the Turkish authorities.
The year 1910 was decisive in the sense of affording definite proof that the regime established in 1908 was not tolerable. The regime had its chance of justifying itself in the eyes of Europe and strengthening its position in relation to its own subjects and to the neighboring Balkan States; it let the chance go. From that time the fate of Turkey in Europe was decided, beyond appeal.
This was also the end of the attempts at autonomy in Macedonia. To realize this autonomy two principal conditions were required: the indivisibility of Turkey and a sincere desire on the part of the Turkish government to introduce radical reforms based on decentralization. No idea was less acceptable to the "Committee of Union and Progress" than this of decentralization, since it was the watchword of the rival political organization. Thenceforward any hope of improving the condition of the Christian populations within the limits of the status quo became illusory. Those limits had to be transcended. Autonomy was no longer possible. Dismemberment and partition had to be faced.
The most natural solution of the Balkan imbroglio appeared to be the creation in Macedonia of a new autonomy or independent unity, side by side with the other unities realized in Bulgaria, Greece, Servia and Montenegro, all of which countries had previously been liberated, thanks to Russian or European intervention. But this solution had become impossible, owing first to the incapacity of the Turkish government, and then to the rival pretensions of the three neigh-wring States to this or that part of the Macedonian inheritance. Mr. Dehn has tried to show on a map the result of this confusion of rival claims (see his sche-
matic map). [This schematic map is borrowed from the little book by Mr. Paul Dehn, Die Voelker Suedeuropas und ihre politischen Probleme. Halle, 1909; in the Anqewandte Geographie Series.] There was hardly any part of the territory of Turkey in Europe (which was not claimed by at least two competitors. These views on the inheritance of the "Sick Man" and for the realization of "great national ideas" in the shape of a "Great" Servia, a "Great" Greece, or a "Great" Bulgaria, made any united action on the part of these little States for their common ends impossible. In theory every one accepted the opinion that they must act together, that the Balkans ought to belong to the Balkan peoples, and that the great neighboring
Powers who might weaken or enslave the little Balkan States, must be kept off In practice, however, the opposite course was adopted. Each courted Russia or Austria, in turn, sometimes even both at the same time, first one and then the other, with a view to opposing his neighbors and securing the prospect of his own country's hegemony.
Russia and Austria for their part naturally pursued their own interests in the Balkans,-Interests that were by no means identical. Geography and ethnography have divided the Balkans into two spheres of influence, the Eastern and the Western, the Servian and the Bulgarian spheres. Diplomatic history has made them into the Austrian and the Russian spheres of influence, hence two opposing pulls-the "German pull" from North to South, and the "Slav pull" from East to West. The plain of the Vardar, which divides Macedonia into two parts, was destined to be the arena where the two influences met and battled. Russia traced the limits of its zone of influence in the treaty of San Stefano in 1878-the whole of Macedonia forming part of Bulgaria indivisible-the tsielo coupna Boulgaria. Austrian policy has also had its treaties, concluded to countervail the Russian pull in the shape of the secret treaties of 1881 and 1889, made with King Milan-the Servian King-who for his part was promised the plain of the Vardar, and the Western half of Macedonia, on condition of Servia's renouncing its intentions upon the Adriatic, its "Pan-Servian" tendencies, that is, of consenting to the annexation of the Sandjak of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and finally all the Servian-speaking countries, as far as Zagreb.
Looked at from this general point of view, the idea of a Balkan alliance was contrary to the idea of partition, since alliance was the instrument of independence, the means to the realization of the idea of "the Balkans for the Balkan peoples," while partition subserved the ambitions of the great neighboring powers. As a matter of fact those who first conceived the idea of alliance were as far as possible remote from that of partition. They were the idealistic youth of 1870, of whom we have spoken above, and in their minds a "Yougo-Slav Federation" was a veritable union of the free and independent Slav democracies. Nor was the idea of partition clearly present to the mind of the first great politician who tried to realize a Yougo-Slav Federation under Servian hegemony, Prince Michel Obrenovits. On the eve of his violent death he was in treaty with Greece, Roumania, Montenegro and the revolutionary "apostles" of still subject Bulgaria, for the preparation of common strife against Turkey. What was the use of partition since there was the absolute property of each to be taken? It is true that with the Slav family itself there was by no means complete unanimity in the idea of alliance without partition. There were some Bulgarians, and those the most far sighted, who protested. Why ally against Turkey when whatever was taken from the Ottoman Empire was at the same time taken from-the Bulgarian people as a whole? But for these latter the reply was taken from Turkey, which was trying the patience of the giaours even when they desired to be
loyal; second from the young Bulgarian revolutionaries, crying, with the voice of their best representative, Liouben Karavelov, the doyen of Bulgarian literature-"First of all we must have union, union, union-and when we are free each shall have what belongs to him."
A remarkable light is thrown by recent events upon these disputes at the end of the sixties. Neither the idea of alliance nor the conflicting claims which appeared at the same time disappeared in the fifty years that lie between us and Prince Michel's first attempts.He was slain in 1868 by assassins."Thy thought shall not perish"-so it runs on his tombstone. It has, in truth, not perished; but it has become more complex. Mutual rivalries became more acute as the area to be partitioned became more confined while still leaving something to partition.
"England's responsibility" in these new complications and difficulties has been set forth by the Duke of Argyll : [See his book Our Responsibility for Turkey.] we, therefore, need not linger over the blow struck at the idea of a federation of the Balkan nationalities when Bulgaria-one and indivisible-according to the treaty of San Stefano,-was divided into three by the Treaty of Berlin. The whole course of succeeding events was the result of this grave error. The most recent events lie there in germ.
The reunion to free Bulgaria of the still vassal Oriental Roumelia, and as the immediate consequence thereof, the Serbo-Bulgarian war of 1885, the growing rivalries between the nationalities in a still subject Macedonia, the new propaganda of the secondary nationalities, the isolation of Greece in its 1897 attempt, the fetishism of the status quo, mitigated and corrected as it was by the intrigues of the Powers, the miscarriage of the hypocritical plan of reforms in Macedonia in 1907-1908, the intermezzo of the Turkish revolution with its failure to solve an insoluble problem, then the greatness and decline of the Balkan "alliance"-all were the natural results of the mistake of Berlin,-a mistake which now everybody sees without the power to correct.
This same series of events has put obstacles in the way of the normal development of the highly national conception of an alliance between the Balkan peoples, has turned it aside from its true aim, that of preparing the way for federation; and by informing it with an alien egoism and mania have delayed its development and brought it prematurely to an end. Any judgment of men and events as they are today must take into account all this past, and not lay to the charge of the present the results of a negligence which goes back for decades.
The idea of Balkan alliance has come into life in our time with a significance quite different from that which it possessed thirty or forty years ago. It is no longer the young Slav enthusiasts' dream of a free federation of Balkan democracies. It is no longer the nationalists and Pan-Slav philosphers' notion of a Russian moral hegemony with Constantinople as its political center. The first
of these dreams was slain by the rivalry of the Balkan States; the second by their love of independence. The Balkan alliance in its later phase was but a tool employed by local policy encouraged by Russia, and directed, under the inspiration of Russian diplomacy, against Germanic pretensions, or in so far as advantage was taken of the device by Balkan statesmen against the invasions of Turkish "Ottomanism" and Athenian ambition towards autonomy. Alliance in this latest phase inevitably implied partition as an essential condition; the means being war with Turkey, the final end the conquest of Turkey in Europe.
The modern history of the alliance might start at the point where Mr. Bourchier [The Balkan League-The London Times, June 4, 5, 6, 11, 13. Use has been made of these articles but the brief historical account which follows has been based on the Commission's own information.] begins in his excellent articles on the Balkan League, that is to say, with the attempt of the Greek Minister, Mr. Tricoupis, in 1891, who openly proposed to Belgrade and Sofia the partition of Turkey in Europe on the basis of a treaty in which the future frontiers of the Balkan States were to be exactly determined in advance. To speak of such a plan to King Milan and to Stamboulov, was to communicate it to the Ballplatz at Vienna and to the Sublime Porte. The pourparlers did not get beyond a mere exchange of amiable courtesies. Austria Hungary had just renewed the treaty with King Milan which led to the fratricidal Serbo-Bulgarian war (1889 to 1895). Some years later she was to sign a secret convention with Roumania. In the event of a common war with Bulgaria, Rou-mania was to receive a portion of Bulgarian territory. It is the very territory, promised by Austria, which Roumania has just been given without war. In 1897, during the Graeco-Turkish war, Mr. Deliannis renewed the proposals of Tricoupis. But his partition formula, repeated so often since, and not even now wholly renounced by the Greeks, was not to the Bulgarians' taste. They preferred negotiating with the Porte for new concessions for their churches and schools in Macedonia, to risking taking part in an ill-prepared and ill-conducted war. Soon after (1901) Austria Hungary brought about the Grseco-Roumanian rapprochement which, together with the Austro-Servian treaty and the Austro-Roumanian convention, finally "enclosed" Bulgaria and threatened to paralyze its action in Macedonia. A Balkan alliance seemed as far remote as possible.
All the same the web spun with such pains was quickly to be broken. The revolution of 1904 in Macedonia made the question an international one. Wallachian propagandism and Greek "conversions" in Macedonia led to a diplomatic rupture between Greece and Roumania (1903). The murder of King Alexandra Obrenovits and the return of the Karageorgevits dynasty to Belgrade (1903) emancipated Servia from Austrian influence. The natural alternatives were either a rapprochement with Russia or the renaissance of the Yougo-Slav alliance. The young generation in Servia and Bulgaria went further and became once more enthusiastic for the federation idea. Writers, artists, students in Bel-
grade and Sofia exchanged visits. Diplomatists followed suit. By 1904 people in Belgrade were discussing a scheme for an offensive and defensive alliance as a means of securing the autonomy of Old Servia and of Macedonia as far as possible by peaceful means, but in case of extremity, by force of arms. The names of those who took part in these pourparlers will reappear in 1911. They were Mr. Pachitch, at whose house secret conversations went on; Milovane Milovanovits, late minister of Foreign Affairs; Dimitri Risov, a Macedonian revolutionary who had become a diplomatist without losing his ardent devotion to the cause; Mr. Kessaptchiev at that time specially sent to discuss the alliance. But difficulties arose as soon as the frontiers began to be spoken of. The Servians gave their adhesion in principle only, to propose the very next day a geographical interpretation of the term "Old Servia," which extended it to cover the whole of the Sandjak. The Bulgarians regarded these claims as exorbitant; and finally after vain disputes lasting three days, the idea of an offensive alliance was given up. On April 12/25, 1904, a defensive alliance was however concluded. But this treaty, far too vague and general in its terms, had no practical result, thanks to the indiscretion of a Servian official who was also the correspondent of the Neue Freie Presse. The treaty was immediately divulged and seeds of distrust consequently implanted in the minds of the allies. The Servians regarded the treaty as annulled after the Bulgarian declaration of independence was made in 1908 without consulting Servia, and greatly to the detriment of Servian national policy, which was then passing through a critical phase, owing to the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria Hungary. The Servians accused the Bulgarians of profiting by their losses to improve their own international position instead of coming to their assistance. Old distrust was thus about to revive when Russian diplomacy took up the alliance idea again. The Russian diplomatists took the promises of a Young Turkish regeneration seriously, and proposed a universal Balkan alliance with a free and constitutionally governed Turkey as a member. They wanted an alliance facing towards the Danube rather than the Bosphorus. Balkan diplomacy knew well enough that the "Sick Man" was incurable; but the chance was seized. It is true that here again the old difficulties about partition rose. In 1909 Mr. Milovanovits vainly proposed the cession of Uskub and Koumanovo to Servia. In 1910 conferences were held at St. Petersburg with Mr. Milovanovits and Mr. Malinov, which, however, did not succeed in arriving at any result. Bulgaria was by no means disposed to sanction the Servian tendencies favored by Russian diplomacy, even in the highly general form of a possible extension of Old Servia, properly so-called, towards the south.
All the same in 1910, as we know, it became clear to all the world that the Young Turk policy of "Ottomanizing" the nationalities by assimilation was going to lead to catastrophe. Growing pressure on Bulgarians and Greeks in Turkey finally brought these enemies together. Mr. Venizelos, since 1910 head of the Athenian cabinet, as early as October proposed an agreement to
Sofia. Once more no agreement could be reached on the delimitation of spheres of influence. The Bulgarians were unwilling to hand over Kavala, Serres, Vodena, Castoria, Florina to the Greeks, in accordance with the old "Deliannis formula." But the condition of things in Macedonia made an understanding a matter of necessity. The only thing to do was to conclude an agreement. The heads of the Christian churches in Constantinople had to make similar representations to the Ottoman government, without waiting for any understanding. At Sofia discussions began as to how an understanding was to be arrived at, and a joint systematic protest was made in defence of the religious and educational privileges granted in common to the Christian communities by the ancient firmans of the sultans and by international treaties.
At Sofia the pourparlers dragged on throughout the Malinov administration. When Mr. Guechov, in March, 1910, succeeded Mr. Malinov as head of the Cabinet, he stopped them. Then Mr. Venizelos proposed to Mr. Guechov, under the seal of secrecy, in March, 1911, not merely an agreement to defend the privileges of the Christians in Turkey, but a defensive alliance, "envisaging the case of an attack" on one of the contracting parties. No reply was made to this proposition, which was kept strictly secret, since the Cretan difficulties might provoke a war in which Bulgaria had no desire to take part. The event which led Bulgaria to consider the necessity of a Balkan alliance in a yet more serious light was the beginning of the Turco-Italian war at the end of September, 1911. When the Italian ultimatum was issued, Bulgarian statesmen were on holiday; Czar Ferdinand and his first Minister were at Vichy. Milovanovits was watching at his post. B. Risov, Th. Theodorov and he discussed the project of an alliance at Belgrade, Vienna and Sofia. Mr. Guechov hastened to return. Mr. Milovanovits met him at the station at Belgrade, got into his carriage and between Belgrade and the little station of Liapovo, the bases of an alliance were laid down in the course of a two hours' conversation. For the first time a Bulgarian minister recognized the necessity and possibility of territorial concession in Macedonia-Uskub and Koumanovo.
It might have been foreseen that public opinion in Bulgaria would, as invariably, be against any such transaction. Rather Macedonia autonomous as a whole under Turkish suzerainty than independent on condition of partition,-such had always been the Bulgarian point of view. Even in 1910, Mr. Malinov, as we have pointed out, prepared to wait rather than make concessions. So now Guechov, once returned to Sofia, again decided to temporize. In December, Milovanovits renewed the alliance proposal; but after ten days without a reply he had to modify his proposition. Then and not until then did the Bulgarian government decide to treat. The pourparlers lasted all winter, and the treaty was concluded between February 29 and March 13, 1912.
In this treaty, which was kept secret, and of which the text was published later by Le Matin, [Monday, November 24, 1913.] the fundamental point was the delimitation of the line of par-
tition "beyond which" Servia agreed "to formulate no territorial claim." A highly detailed map of this frontier was annexed to the treaty. [It is reproduced here from a reduced and simplified copy published in the Echo de Bulgarie of June 7/20, 1913.] Bulgarian diplomatists still wished to keep an open door for themselves. That is why they left the responsibility for the concessions demanded to the Czar of Russia. "Bulgaria agrees to accept this frontier," they added, "if the Emperor of Russia, who shall be requested to act as final arbiter in this question, pronounces in favor of the line." Their idea was that the Emperor might still adjudge to them the "disputed zone" they were in the act of ceding, between the frontier marked on the map and Old Servia, properly so-called, "to the north and west of Char-Planina." "It goes without saying," the treaty added, "that the two contracting parties undertake to accept as definitive the frontier line which the Emperor of Russia may have found, within the limits indicated below, most consonant with the rights and interests of the two parties." Evidently "within the limits indicated below" meant between Char-Planina and the line marked on the map, "beyond which Servia agreed to formulate no territorial claim." That was the straightforward meaning of the treaty, afterwards contested by the Servians. The line of partition of which the treaty spoke corresponded fully with the ethnographic conclusions of the learned geographer, Mr. Tsviyits; conclusions which made a profound impression on the Czar Ferdinand at the time of his interview with Mr. Tsviyits. It was these conclusions probably which made the Czar decide to accept the compromise. [See Mr. Tsviyits' ethnographic map, published in his pamphlet The Annexation of Bosnia and the Servian Question, 1909. The map annexed to the treaty of Feb. 29 (March 13), 1912, differs from it to the advantage of Servia in the western region, but corresponds generally with it in the eastern part of the frontier agreed upon.] Mr. Tsviyits was also the first to communicate to the world, in his article of November, 1912, in the Review of Reviews, the frontier established by the treaty. [Mr, Tsviyits' article has appeared in a Servian translation, but at that time Servian claims had already increased and the pamphlet was banned. In a second edition, adopted by the "Information Bureau," the passage describing the frontiers was simply omitted. The omitted passage runs as follows: "The Southern frontier of Old Servia, or the line dividing the Bulgarian and Servian spheres of interest (starts from the Bulgarian frontier, near Kustendil, by the line of partition between the rivers Ptchinia and Kriva-Reka, leaving Kriva-Palnika and Kratovo in the Bulgarian sphere and Uskub and Koumanovo in the Servian. The frontier then crosses the Ovtche-Pole, by the line of division between Bregalnitsa and Ptchinia, and passes the Vardar, to the north of Veles. Thence it goes over the slopes of the Yagoupitsa mountains, and along the ulterior line of division, reaches the Baba mountain as far as Lake Okhrida, so that Prilepe, Krouchevo and the town of Okhrida are in the Bulgarian sphere and Strouga, Debar and Tetovo in the Servian.)Old Servia issues, through a narrow belt, on the Adriatic near Scutari, Alessio and (perhaps) Durazzo. [Passages within parentheses omitted.]] The reason why Bulgarian diplomatists decided on making a concession so little acceptable to public opinion is now clear. They did more. After deciding on eventual partition they reverted to the idea of autonomy and laid it down that partition was only to take place in case the organization of the conquered countries "as a distinct autonomous province," should be found "impossible" in the "established conviction" of both parties. Up to the "liquida-
tion," the occupied countries were to be regarded as "falling under common dominion-condominium." Finally the treaty was to remain defensive purely, until the two parties "find themselves in agreement" on "undertaking common military action." This "action" was to "be undertaken solely in the event of Russia's not opposing it," and the consent of Russia was to be obligatory. Turkey had been expressly designated as the objective of "action" in the cases forecast, but included was "any one among the Great Powers which should attempt to annex any portion whatsoever of the territories of the peninsula." Such were the precautions and provisions designed to guarantee Bulgarian diplomatists against abuse. All, however, were to fall away at the first breath of reality.
Sofia has been credited with a secondary interest in the Graeco-Bulgarian agreement proffered by Venizelos in April, 1911. Since 1897 the Greek army had been considered almost a negligible quantity, and the advance made under French instruction was hardly known. But the Greek navy was needed to cut Turkey's communication with Anatolia via the Aegean Sea, and thus prevent the transport of troops to Macedonia. Thus as soon as the Serbo-Bulgarian alliance had been concluded in February, conferences with Greece were entered upon. The Greeks proposed to the Bulgarians to discuss the question of future frontiers. Since Greek aid was not rated high at Sofia, the Bulgarians were not inclined to make sacrifices, the more because of designs on Salonica. On this point previous negotiations had made it abundantly clear that the Greeks, so far from yielding would again propose their unacceptable frontier. It was therefore unhappily decided to leave the war to settle the question, with a secret intention of being the first to reach the desired spot. As for the alliance, it was concluded on a "purely defensive" basis with the promise "of lending the agreement no kind of aggressive tendency." [The text of the Graeco-Bulgarian treaty was published by Le Matin November 26, 1913.] The principal object appeared to be the "peaceful co-existence of the different nationalities in Turkey, on the basis of real and actual political equality and respect of rights accruing from treaties or otherwise conceded to the Christian nationalities of the Empire." But it was foreseen that a "systematic attempt" on these rights on the part of Turkey might ;as readily be the casus foederis as a direct attack on the territories of the contracting parties. It should be added that the expression "rights accruing from treaties" was inserted in the text on the insistence of the Bulgarian diplomats, who intended by this reference to treaties, Article 23 of the Treaty of Berlin, i. e., Macedonian autonomy. Clearly in the hour of the conclusion of this treaty, May 16/29, 1912, complete vagueness prevailed as to eventual "action." The only thing which was clear was that Bulgaria was not going to make war on Turkey about Crete. To this end a declaration had been added to the treaty 'which merely bound Bulgaria to "benevolent neutrality" in the event of war breaking out "because of the admission of Cretan deputies to the Greek parliament."
The Serbo-Bulgarian and Graeco-Bulgarian treaties concluded, the King of Montenegro came on the scene in his turn. Nicholas was always ready to take part in any combination of the Balkan States against Turkey. He had spoken of it to Russia in 1888; he renewed his proposition at the Russian Embassy in Constantinople in July, 1911. When the Turco-Italian war began, in September, he was the first to propose common military action on the part of Servia, Bulgaria, Greece and Montenegro. An agreement was made with Bulgaria in April, 1912, and with Greece somewhat later. Belgrade remained. It was not on good terms with Cettigne, partly because of the patriotic rivalry between the two Servian States (each of which aspired to the role of "Piemont") ; partly because of anti-dynastic intrigues supposed to be going on either side and partly because of the reactionary regime of Nicholas, which drove all the educated youth of the country to emigration and conspiracy abroad. Bulgarian diplomats acted as intermediaries. Mr. Danev communicated to the Vienna Zeit an amusing account of the way in which the last stone of the Balkan alliance (which Russia wanted to build up against Austria Hungary) was placed at the end of May in the Hofburg at Vienna. None of these treaties however became effective until the end of September, after a series of events in Turkey which ended by seriously threatening the very existence of the nationalities in Macedonia. These events opened in the spring of 1912 with a revolt in Albania, a revolt which had been foreseen and taken into consideration by the enemies of Turkey. In summer the revolt bore fruit which exceeded all expectation. The cabinet resigned, the chamber was dissolved, the executive committee of the party of "Union and Progress," threatened with complete defeat, was compelled to grant the Albanians all they asked in order to stop the movement in Constantinople, a movement which the discontented army refused to prevent. This demonstration of Turkish weakness encouraged the new allies, the more so that the promises of Albanian autonomy, covering the four vilayets of Macedonia and Old Servia, directly threatened the Christian nationalities with extermination. The Servians hastened to oppose the plan of a "greater Albania" by their plan for the partition of Turkey in Europe among the Balkan States into four spheres of influence. Counting on the possibility of European intervention the organization of the autonomous provinces based on the ethnographic principle was undertaken with a minimum of success. But Europe did not "find itself."
The proposal made on August 14 by Mr. Berchtold, to assist Turkey in extending "decentralization" to the Christian nationalities was no more than a trial move, adroitly designed as a means of feeling the ground. Russia replied by an exhortation to the allies to abstain from aggressive action of any kind, and the endeavor to detach Bulgaria from Servia and Servia from Bulgaria. The reply of the allies, prepared with the utmost secrecy, was to conclude a series of military conventions, complementary to the alliances, which did this time anticipate and prepare for war.
The Bulgarian military convention, foreshadowed by the treaty, was signed as early as April 29/May 12. Bulgaria undertook in case of war to mobilize 200000 men; Servia 150,000-minimum figures, since there could be no thought of conquering Turkey with an army of 350,000 men. Of these 200,000 men, Bulgaria was to dispatch half to Macedonia, and half to Thrace. At the same time the convention took into account the possibility of Austria Hungary's marching upon Servia. In that case Bulgaria undertook to send 200,000 men to Servia's assistance.
The basis of the Graeco-Bulgarian military convention was different; it was concluded almost on the eve of general mobilization, September 13/26. Bulgaria promised, in case of war, an effective army 300,000 strong; Greece, 120,000. Bulgaria undertook to take the offensive "with an important part of its army" in the three Macedonian vilayets; but in case Servia should take part in the war with at least 120,000 men, "Bulgaria might employ the whole of its military forces in Thrace." Now that real war was about to begin and the main Turkish force was directed hither, it was high time to contemplate war in Thrace which had been left, in the hypothetical agreements, to Russia's charge, as Mr. Bourchier assumes. This made it necessary to change, .define and complete the military agreement with Servia of April 29/May 12. The document was now more than once remodeled in consonance with new agreements arrived at between the heads if the General Staff of the two armies-such agreements having been fore-shadowed in Articles 4 and 13. The special arrangement of June 19/July 2 provides that the necessary number of troops agreed upon might be transported from the Vardar to the Maritza and vice versa, "if the situation demands it." On August 23/September 5, the Bulgarians demand to have all their forces for disposition in Thrace, the Servians make objections and no agreement is reached. At last, three days after the Greek military convention (September 5/28), an understanding was arrived at. "The whole of the Bulgarian army will operate in the valley of the Maritza, leaving one division only in the first days on the Kustendil-Doupnitsa line." But if the Servian army repulsed the Turks on the Uskub-Veles-Chtipe line-and advanced southward, the Bulgarians might recall their division to the theater of the Maritza to reinforce their armies, saving only the battalions of the territorial army in Macedonia." Later, as is known, it was the Servians who sent two divisions with siege artillery to Adrianople. The Servians were later to declare the arrangements made by the two General Staffs forced and not binding, and to use this as an argument for treaty revision.
While making their final dispositions, the allies still awaited European intervention in Turkey. In vain. Friends only gave them counsels of prudence. Enemies were not sorry to see the allies given a drubbing by the Turks, whom everybody in Europe regarded as infinitely their superiors. During the two weeks in which final decisions were being made in Bulgaria, Mr. Sazonov traveled
about in England and talked about Persia. When it appeared at the last moment that the Balkan States were going to act, thanks to Mr. Poincare and with the conditional assent of Mr. Berchtold, it was thought advisable to issue, September 25/October 8, an Austro-Russian proclamation to the effect that if the Powers disapproved energetically of measures contrary to peace, they would take the execution of reforms in hand, subject to the suzerainty of the Sultan and the territorial integrity of Turkey; if war broke out, whatever were the issue, they would not permit any change in the territorial status quo of Turkey in Europe. Alas! while the reply to be sent to this note was under discussion, King Nicholas of Montenegro declared war on Turkey (October 9) ; on September 30/October 13 the allies formally demanded Turkey's consent to the autonomy of the European vilayets, redivided according to nationality. On October 4/17, Turkey declared war.
If it be now asked what were the causes of the first Balkan war, three principal ones may be found. First, the weakness and want of foresight of Turkey, on the verge of dissolution; second, the powerlessness of Europe to impose on a constitutional Turkey the reforms which she had succeeded in introducing into an absolute Turkey, and third, the consciousness of increased strength which alliance gave to the Balkan States, each with a national mission before it, namely, the protection of the men of its race and religion dwelling in Turkey, against the Ottomanization policy which threatened national existence. The first two reasons made the war possible and inevitable; the third guaranteed its success. In a few weeks the territories of Turkey in Europe were invaded by the allied armies and the whole country from the west of the fortified lines of Tchataldja and the Gallipoli peninsula, with the exception of Albania, in their hands as condominium. This was, at least, the principle acknowledged by the Serbo-Bulgarian treaty. This principle of the condominium had to be reconciled with the fact of the occupation and the new demands that rose up, the consequences of unexpected success. As might have been expected, partition was more difficult than conquest. Another war, the conflict for the "equilibrium," was to follow on the first, the conflict for freedom.
There had long existed germs of discord among the Balkan nationalities which could not be stifled by the treaties of alliance of which we know. Rather the texts of these treaties created fresh misunderstandings and afforded formal pretexts to cover the real reasons of conflict. There was but one means which could have effectually prevented the development of the germs-to maintain the territorial status quo of Turkey and grant autonomy to the nationalities without a change of sovereignty. This could not have been, it is true, a definitive solution ; it could only be a delay, a stage, but a stage that would have bridged the transition. In default of an issue which Turkey .rendered impossible by its
errors, Europe by its too protracted patience and the allies by their success, the change was too abrupt. It produced the deplorable results we are to study under the aspect of the "excesses" committed by the different nationalities when reduced to an elementary struggle for existence carried out by the most primitive means.
We find this struggle in Macedonia from the first days of the Servian and Greek occupation onwards. At first there was general rejoicing and an outburst of popular gratitude towards the liberators. The Macedonian revolutionaries themselves had foreseen and encouraged this feeling. They said in their "proclamation to our brothers," published by the delegates of the twenty-five Macedonian confederacies on October 5/18, i. e., at the very beginning of the war:
"Brothers:-your sufferings and your pains have touched the heart of your kindred. Moved by the sacred duty of fraternal compassion, they come to your aid to free you from the Turkish yoke. In return for their sacrifice they desire nothing but to reestablish peace and order in the land of our birth. Come to meet these brave knights of freedom therefore with triumphal crowns. Cover the way before their feet with flowers and glory. And be magnanimous to those who yesterday were your masters. As true Christians, give them not evil for evil. Long live liberty! Long live the brave army of liberation!" In fact the Servian army entered the north and the Greek army the south of Macedonia, amid cries of joy from the population. But this enthusiasm for the liberators soon gave place to doubts, then to disenchantment, and finally was converted to hatred and despair. The Bulgarian journal published at Salonica, Bulgarine, first records some discouraging cases whose number was swollen by the presence 3f certain individuals, chauvinists of a peculiar turn, who gave offence to the national sentiment of the country by the risks they ran. "It is the imperative duty of the powers in occupation," said the journal, "to keep attentive watch over the behavior of irresponsible persons." Alas! five days later (November 20) the journal had to lay it down, as a general condition of the stability of the alliance, that the powers in occupation should show toleration to all nationalities and refrain from treating some of them as enemies. Four days later the journal, instead of attacking the persons responsible, was denouncing the powers who in their blind chauvinism take no account of the national sentiments of the people temporarily subject to them." They still, however, cherished the hope that the local authorities were acting without the knowledge of Belgrade. The next day the editor wrote his leader under a question addressed to the Allied Governments: "Is this a war of liberation or a war of conquest?" He knew the reply well enough; the Greek authorities forbade the existence of this Bulgarian paper in their town of Salonica.
The illusion of the inhabitants likewise disappeared before the touch of reality. The Servian soldier, like the Greek, was firmly persuaded that in Macedonia he would find compatriots, men who could speak his language and address him with jivio or zito. He found men speaking a language different
from his, who cried hourrah! He misunderstood or did not understand at all. The theory he had learned from youth of the existence of a Servian Macedonia and a Greek Macedonia naturally suffered; but his patriotic conviction that Macedonia must become Greek or Servian, if not so already, remained unaffected. Doubtless Macedonia had been what he wanted it to become in those times of Douchan the Strong or the Byzantine Emperors. It was only agitators and propagandist Bulgarians who instilled into the population the idea of being Bulgarian. The agitators must be driven out of the country, and it would again become what it had always been, Servian or Greek. Accordingly they acted on this basis.
Who were these agitators who had made the people forget the Greek and Servian tongues? First, they were the priests; then the schoolmasters; lastly the revolutionary elements who, under the ancient regime, had formed an "organization" ; heads of bands and their members, peasants who had supplied them with money or food,-in a word the whole of the male population, in so far as it was educated and informed. It was much easier for a Servian or a Greek to discover all these criminal patriots than it had been for the Turkish authorities, under the absolutist regime, to do so. The means of awakening the national conscience were much better known to Greeks and Servians, for one thing, since they were accustomed to use them for their own cause. Priests, schoolmasters, bands existed among the Greeks and Servians, as well as among the Bulgarians. In Macedonia the difference, as we know, lay in the fact that the schoolmaster or priest, the Servian voyevoda or Greek andarte, addressed himself to the minority, and had to recruit his own following instead of finding them ready made. Isolated in the midst of a Bulgarian population, he made terms with Turkish power while the national Bulgarian "organizations" fought against it. Since the representative of the national minority lived side by side with his Bulgarian neighbors, and knew them far better than did the Turkish official or policeman, he could supply the latter with the exact information. He learned still more during the last few years of general truce between the Christian nationalities and growing alliance against the Turk. Almost admitted to the plot, many secrets were known to him. It was but natural he should use this knowledge for the advantage of the compatriots who had appeared in the guise of liberators. On the arrival of his army, he was no longer solitary, isolated and despised; he became useful and necessary, and was proud of serving the national cause. With his aid, denunciation became an all powerful weapon; it penetrated to the recesses of local life and revived events of the past unknown to the Turkish authorities. These men, regarded by the population as leaders and venerated as heroes, were arrested and punished like mere vagabonds and brigands, while the dregs were raised to greatness.
This progressive disintegration of social and national life began in Macedonia with the entry of the armies of occupation, and did not cease during the eight months which lie between the beginning of the first war and the beginning
of the second. It could not fail to produce the most profound changes. The Bulgarian nation was decapitated. A beginning was made when it was easiest. he openly revolutionary elements were gotten rid of,-the comitadjis and all lose who had been connected with the movement of insurrection against the Turkish rule or the conflict with the national minorities. This was the easier because in the chaos of Macedonian law there was no clearly drawn line of demarcation between political and ordinary crime.
To combat the Bulgarian schools was more difficult. The time was already long past when the schoolmaster was necessarily a member of the "interior organization." The purely professional element had steadily displaced the apostles and martyrs of preceding generations. But the conquerors saw things as they had been decades ago. For them the schoolmaster was always the conspirator, the dangerous man who must be gotten rid of, and the school, however strictly “professional,” was a center from which Bulgarian civilization emanated. This why the school became the object of systematic attack on the part of Servians and Greeks. Their first act on arriving in any place whatsoever was to close the schools and use them as quarters for the soldiery. Then the teachers of the village were collected together and told that their services were no longer retired if they refused to teach in Greek or Servian. Those who continued to declare themselves Bulgarians were exposed to a persecution whose severity varied with the length of their resistance. Even the most intransigeant had to avow themselves beaten in the end; if not, they were sometimes allowed to depart for Bulgaria, but more usually sent to prison in Salonica or Uskub.
The most difficult people to subdue were the priests, and above all the bishops. They were first asked to change the language of divine service. Endeavors were made to subject them to the Servian or Greek ecclesiastical authorities, and they were compelled to mention their names in the liturgy. If the priest showed the smallest inclination to resist, his exarchist church was taken from him and handed over to the patriarchists; he was forbidden to hold any communication with his flock, and on the smallest disobedience was accused of political propagandism and treason. At first an open attack on the bishops was not ventured on. When Neophite, bishop of Veles, refused to separate the name of King Peter from the names of the other kings of the allies in his prayers, and used colors in his services which were suspected of being the Bulgarian national colors, Mr. Pachitch advised the military powers at Uskub (January 4/17) to treat him as equal to the Servian bishop and with correctitude. This ministerial order, however, did not prevent the local administrator of Veles, some weeks later (January 24/February 6 and February 4/17), from forbidding Neophite to hold services and assemblies in his bishopric, to see priests outside of the church or to hold communication with the villages. As the bishop refused to take the veiled hints given to him to depart for Bulgaria, an officer was finally sent to his house accompanied by soldiers, who took his abode for the army, after having beaten his secretary. In the same way Cosmas, bishop of Debra,
was forced to abandon his seat and leave his town. It was even worse at Uskub, where the holder of the bishopric, the Archimandrite Methodius, was first driven out of his house, taken by force, shut up in a room and belabored by four soldiers until he lost consciousness (April 8/21). Cast out into the street, Methodius escaped into a neighboring house, in which a Frenchman dwelt who told the story to Mr. Carlier, French consul at Uskub. Under his protection, Methodius left for Salonica on April 13/26, whence he was sent to Sofia. The Commission has in its possession a deposition signed by the foreign doctors of Salonica who saw and examined Methodius on April 15/28, and found his story "entirely probable." [See the Appendix.]
The leaders, intellectual and religious, of the revolutionary movement, having been removed, the population of the villages were directly approached and urged to change their nationality and proclaim themselves Servian or Greek. The ecclesiastic Bulgarian reports written from every part of Macedonia are unanimous on this head. "You know," Bishop Neophite of Veles said to his persecutor, "in your capacity as sub-prefect, what the Servian priests and schoolmasters are doing in the villages. They are visiting the Bulgarian villages with soldiers and forcing the people to write themselves down as Servians, drive out their Bulgarian priest and ask to have a Servian priest given them. Those who refuse to proclaim themselves Servians are beaten and tortured." We are in possession of the Servian formula of renunciation of Bulgarian nationality. This is the formula which the priests of these villages and their flocks had to address to Mr. Vincentius, the Servian metropolitan at Uskub:
I and the flock confided to my charge by God were formerly Servian, but the terrors with which the Bulgarian comitadjis representing the revolutionary organization inspired us, and the violence they used towards us, compelled us and our fathers before us to turn from the patriarchate to the exarchate, thus making Bulgarians of the pure Servians we were. Thus we called ourselves Bulgars under fear of death until the arrival of our Servian army, until the moment of our liberation from the Turks. Now that we are no longer in fear of bombs, stones, and bullets, we beg your Holiness, on our own behalf and on behalf of our flocks, to deign to restore us to our Holy Church of Uskub, to restore us to the faith which we have for a time betrayed through fear of death. Kissing your holy right hand, we ask you to pray to God to pardon our sin. Signed at Sopot, March 28, 1913.
This formula was sent, in Servia, by a Servian official, Daniel Tsakits, secretary to the Malinska community at Koumanovo, to the Bulgarian priest, Nicolas Ivanov, with the following letter:
Father Nicolas, thou shalt sign this letter that I send thee, and after thee all the villagers of Sopot are to sign likewise the Trstenitchani, the
Piestchani, the Stanevchani, and the Alakintchani, who are thy parishioners. The whole to be ready by Saturday. Greeting from Daniel Tsakits, 27, III, 1913, Malino.
On the margin, Mr. Tsakits added that there must be twenty signatures per village and, to be the more sure of his man, gave him on the other side indications ad oculos: e. g.:
The precaution was not superfluous, for priest Nicolas replied to this invitation by himself making off to Chtipe, to the protection of the Bulgarian authorities. This is what he wrote to the sub-prefect at Chtipe:
I did not desire to lead my parishioners to the Servian church. Since I could not renounce my Bulgarian nationality, I have emigrated. I should add that my family is exposed to the revenge of the Servian authorities and that my children, remaining in their birthplace, will be condemned to imprisonment at Belgrade if I do not immediately return.
The Servians have attempted to deny the authenticity of the secret Bulgarian documents cited above, and a small collection of secret Servian documents, likewise authentic, has actually been published to refute them. We shall return thereto; but upon the point that interests us it must be said that these documents only confirm what we have already said. "Anyone calling himself Bulgarian," writes a certain Peter Kotsov, a Macedonian Bulgar, in a letter of January 11/24, 1913, "risks being killed. The Servians have introduced their communal administration throughout the villages, and installed a Servian schoolmaster for every ten villages. We can not act and we are in a difficult position because the Servians have taken all the Bulgarians' arms. We do what we can, we call to the people; but we are all waiting for the Bulgarian army. Make it come as soon as possible, or we shall all be subjected by the Servians. Even the staunchest Bulgarians are ready to become Servians. The secret police has
numerous agents. Anyone who ventures to speak ill of the Servians exposes himself to much suffering. [The documents are published in an appendix to Balcanicus' book, The Servians and Buigarians in the Balkan War. Our quotation is taken from the German translation Serbien und Bulgarien im Balkankriege, 1912-13, ins Deutsche uebertragen von Dr. jur. L. Markowitsch, Wigand, Leipzig, 1913." The French translation of the original perverts the meaning of the published documents. For example, in our quotation the first phrase (German "Wer sich als Bulgare bekennf, dem droht die Lebensgefahr") is translated as "It is impossible for us to raise the people." The last phrase "Wer was Schlechtes hier von Serben sagt, dem wird es nicht wohlergehen," is simply omitted.] In the South of Macedonia, in the Greek occupation zone [See the zones of occupation on the map (page 55) taken without alteration from Balcanicus’ book to show the Servian point of view the more clearly. We have merely made the stippling rather more distinct and completed the Albanian frontier to the South, as projected at the London Conference (Balcanicus shows an Albania of which more than half is in Servian occupation), adding the line of the Serbo-Bulgarian frontier as agreed by the treaty of February 29/ March 13, 1912. Balcanicus is the pseudonym of a well-known Servian statesman.] the same endeavors are being made to make the population Greek."
Here are some examples, from among thousands. A letter from the village of Dembesi (Castoria) on December 11/24, 1912, runs:
The first care of the Greek officers and soldiers arriving here is to discover if the population of the said village and its environs is Bulgarian or Greek. If the population is pure Bulgarian, the officers order the peasants to "become Greeks again, that being the condition of a peaceful life."
Evidently here again the underlying assumption made is that the whole population was Greek in the past. "How long have you been Bulgarian?" the Greek officer asked at Khroupichta, for example. "For years," was the reply. “Return to old times then; become Greeks again," was the order thereupon. And he showed remarkable clemency.In the village of Gorno-Nestrame, when the population replied in Bulgarian to questions put in Greek, the Greek Beer cried out angrily: "Mi fonasete vourgarika"-[Don't speak Bulgarian] : we are in Greece and anyone who speaks Bulgarian shall be off to Bulgaria. In ?me villages the question was put in this form: "Are you Christians or Bulgarians?" In several villages the inhabitants were made to sign petitions whose contents, unknown to them, were a demand for reunion with Greece. "What a shame," said the Greek gendarmes at Gorno-Koufalovo (March 12/25), We have freed you. The voice of Alexander the Great calls to you from the tomb; do you not hear it?You sleep on and go on calling yourselves Bulgarians!"
Where then was the Bulgarian army for which people were crying in Macedonia and begging it to come soon, if Bulgarian Macedonia were to be saved? In the eve of the war, as we have seen, the Bulgarian General Staff insisted on having 100,000 men left free, according to the terms of the treaty, to fight back to back with the Servians in Macedonia, and thus effect a real condominium after the conquest. To defeat the Turks in the principal theater of war was first and foremost a matter of imperious strategic necessity. After the first
victories, however, and the repulsion of the Turks at Kirk Kilisse, Lule Bourgas, Tchorlou, and Tchataldja, a new reason for continuing the war appeared. After the end of November the question might be put, as by the editor of the Bulgarian paper at Salonica, whether this was a war of liberation or of conquest. The war of liberation has in fact gained its end at Lule Bourgas (October 31), Salonica (October 27), Monastir (October 28). Why go on pouring out the blood of hundreds of thousands of men and expending great sums of money down to the capture of Adrianople (March 13), of Yanina (February 24), Durazzo and Scutari (April 9) ? The question was debated at length in all its details at Belgrade during the debates on the address at the beginning of November (new style), and at Sofia above all, in the three weeks of the election campaign (November 17-December 7). For divers reasons the two parties agreed to end the war in November, 1912, and the Servian opposition, as well as the Bulgarian opposition, tried to prove that statesmen and parties had committed a grave error in letting- it drag on longer (down to May, 1913). In the first place, what had the Servians to gain by it? A discussion between the opposition orator, Mr. Drachkovits, and the deputies composing the majority in the Skupshtina (October 23/Nov. 5, 1913) will show:
Mr. Milorad Drachkovits: For Bulgaria the breaking of the armistice and the new war spelt Adrianople, the most important fortress in the Balkans after Constantinople. For Bulgaria that meant the addition to the one sea she possessed of two others, and the permanent isolation of Constantinople. But what does that mean for us ? What are we going to gain in compensation for the acquisition of Adrianople, of Thrace and of three seas, the desires of the Bulgarians?
Mr. Drachkovits: But gentlemen of the majority, we have already bought it back. We have acquired it.
Mr. Drachkovits: If you want Servia to put the treaty in force, first make Bulgaria do so. But you are freeing Bulgaria from an engagement which it contracted while making Servia responsible for an engagement into which it never entered.
Anastasius Petrovits: It is that fact which, as the world recognizes, has given the government its most real rights over Macedonia.
Mr. Drachkovits: We have not assisted all those who have recognized the fact; but we have assisted Bulgaria, which does not recognize it.
We shall see that it is in truth the eight months' delay which allows Servia to annul the treaty and keep the whole of Macedonia. But how do the Bulgarians come to allow the war to be thus prolonged? How did they, or rather how did their government fail to see that the occupation of Macedonia for eight months by the Servians and Greeks was going to prevent the attainment of the real end of the war,-the unification of Bulgarian nationality?
Ghenadiev by his predecessors, and especially by Mr. Theodore Theodorov, were plausible enough. Yet, it is true that Grand Vizier Kiamil asked for peace on October 29/Nov. 11, 1902. But the General Staff, among them General Savov, insisted that war should be recommenced without dragging on the pourparlers. You say that Turkey was ready at that time to hand over Adrianople? The case never arose. You cite as proof the mysterious mission to Constantinople of the Bulgarian banker, Mr. Kaltchev (December 10-13/23-26) ? Without insisting on the fact that the government had no information about a mission that was entirely confidential (Mr. Guechov's first act when hearing of it was to offer his resignation), Mr. Kaltchev himself and his interlocutor, Mr. Noradounghian, Foreign Minister in the Kiamil cabinet, made it known through the press that the questions at issue were the autonomy of Macedonia and Thrace and the condominium at Dede-Agatch, and that there was no question of the cession of Adrianople. [Kiamil asked that the garrison in Adrianople might be allowed to depart and passage be left free as far as Tchataldia.] Mr. Ghenadiev continued to talk of a third opportunity for negotiations: the interview between General Savov and Nazim Pasha and Noradounghian, at Tchataldja on December 26/January 8, which the Turkish ministry resigned themselves to the abandonment of the beleaguered fortress in return for certain concessions in favor of Moslem religious establishments and subject to the undertaking that Greek pretensions to the islands were not upheld-but, Mr. Theodorov asserts, all that is false; if it were true the acceptance of conditions so equivocal would have been tantamount to a breach of alliance and would have stopped the regular negotiations going on in London.
In all these questions of fact, the last word has probably not yet been said. What is clear so far, is that in so far as Mr. Theodorov succeeded in exonerating himself, and the Danev Cabinet found excuses for missing all these happy opportunities for negotiations, it was only by means of casting the responsibility on others in higher places.
It will be seen from the preceding that by the end of 1912 there were two policies in Bulgaria: the policy of the cabinet and that of those in direct contact with the army. Ministers might be anxious to be faithful to the terms of the alliance; that consideration hardly troubled General Savov's entourage. The press has said a great deal about the romanticism of the latter, of Czar Ferdinand's desire to make a triumphal entry into Constantinople, of the white horses and precious Venetian saddle kept ready for the attack on Tchataldja. This followed immediately upon Kiamil's peace proposal of October 29/November 11, the prospects of which were notoriously weakened by its failure. After demanding Adrianople, a new frontier was proposed, Rodosto-Malatra, instead Midia-Enos already adopted by international diplomacy. Such an extension of ambitions could not but hide from sight the principal object of the war. To desire to take Adrianople at whatever cost was to risk the loss of Macedonia.
To demand an outlet on the sea of Marmora was to have lost all feeling of the international position. Was it a pure chance that Macedonia was forgotten amid the secretive but remote ambitions which appeared thus unexpectedly on the horizon ? A recollection of what was said in the second part of this chapter on the relations between the Bulgarian government and the revolutionary movement in Macedonia, will show that there was nothing accidental in this neglect. Distrust was ever active between the Bulgarian government and the Macedonian movement. The former was perpetually apprehensive that the comitadjis would involve them in internal or international complications. Now that Macedonia was on the point of being freed, everything was done to prevent the Macedonians themselves from having any direct share in the work of liberation. The reason may have lain partly in that notion of partition in Macedonia, admitted in the treaties, but unknown to the public at large, which had yet to become accustomed to it. In any case the 15,000 Macedonian volunteers who might have been left to fight in Macedonia itself, near their homes, were compelled to dwell throughout the war, far away from their villages, at Tchataldja and Boulair. The number of inconvenient witnesses of the work of denationalization in Macedonia was as far as possible reduced, and the taking possession of the conquered country by the Servian and Greek armies as far as possible facilitated. If the aim of these tactics was to facilitate partition, the result went beyond it. What was precipitated was the loss of Macedonia to the profit of the allies. Fear of a real liberation of the Macedonian nation brought about its conquest by the competitors. In January, the Macedonian legionaries of General Ghenev began accusing the Bulgarian government of having deceived the people in order to "sell Macedonia." In fact the government deceived only itself.
True, the Bulgarian government had no notion of making any sacrifice in turning its attention from Veles, Monastir, Okhrida, Castoria and Florina, to which it should have been directed, to Salonica and Rodosto. They thought they could chew all they had bitten off. The members of the Russophil Guechov-Danev cabinet believed it because they were sure of the sacredness of treaty obligations and believed that the existence of the arbitration was a sort of guarantee. The military party and public opinion were sure of the excellence of natural rights which they are ready to defend with the sword.
Were there not, nevertheless, certain premonitory signs which should have proved to the blindest the lack of prudence in combining such complete mistrust of others with such entire self confidence?
First there was the state of things in Macedonia above described. The denationalization process had gone much further there than diplomatists were willing to admit. The partition treaty had long been violated when Mr. Pachitch was still talking of introducing modifications into the treaty to save it from complete annihilation.
On September 15, 1912, that is to say, six and a half months after the conclusion of the treaty, and twenty days before the beginning of the war abroad,
Servia's representative received a secret circular demanding the incorporation in "Old Servia," beyond the agreed frontier, of the towns of Prilepe, Kritchevo and Okhrida. With the victories of the Servian army, the list of concessions demanded rapidly lengthened. Mr. Pachitch was still only talking of Prilepe, the town of the legendary hero, Marko Kralivits, when the army was asking for Monastir. When he asked for Monastir, the army insisted on a frontier co-terminous with Greece. The government ended by accepting all the conditions laid down by the country, conditions that grew more and more exacting. The military party was powerful; it was led by the hereditary prince; and it invariably succeeded in overriding the first minister, always undecided, always temporizing and anxious to arrange everything pleasantly. The demands presented to the Bulgarians by Mr. Pachitch were as vague and indecisive as his home policy. He began in the autumn of 1912, by offering a revision of the treaty in the official organ. Then in December, in a private letter to his ambassador at Sofia, he informed Mr. Guechov, the head of the Bulgarian cabinet, that revision was necessary. In January his ideas as to the limits within which the said revision should take place, were still undecided. In February he submitted written proposals to the Bulgarian government, and suggested that revision might be undertaken "without rousing public opinion or allowing the Great Powers to mix themselves up with the question of partition." At this moment Mr. Pachitch could still fancy that he had the solution of the conflict in his hand. He was to lose this illusion. His colleague was already writing his "Balcanicus" pamphlet in which he took his stand on the clause pacta servanda simt, with the reservation rebus sic stantibus, and pointing to the changes in the disposition of the allied armies between the two theaters of war (see above), as infractions of the treaty which must lead to revision. In his speech of May 29, Mr. Pachitch ended by accepting this reasoning. At the same time the military authorities in Macedonia had decided to hold on. On February 27/ March 12, they told the population of Veles that the town would remain in Servia. On April 3/16, Major Razsoukanov, Bulgarian attache with the General Staff of the Servian army at Uskub, told his government that his demands were not even answered with conditional phrases. "This is provisional, until it has been decided to whom such and such a village belongs" (in the Chtip or Doiran areas). Major Razsoukanov learned that at the instance of the General Staff the Belgrade government had decided on the rivers Zletovska, Bregalnitsa and Lakavitsa, as the definite eastern limit of the occupation territory. The interesting correspondence published by Balcanicus in his pamphlet (see above) refers to the forced execution of this resolution in the disputed territories during the month of March. We have here, on the one hand, the Bulgarian comitadjis begging, according to the advice of the above letter, for the arrival of the Bulgarian force and trying, in its absence, to do its work, well or ill; on the other, the Servian army, setting up Servian administration in the villages, closing the Bulgarian schools, driving out the comitadjis and "reestablishing order."
Between the two parties, contending in a time of peace, stood the population,. forced to side with one or the other and naturally inclining to the stronger. Mr. Razsoukanov (who gives us confirmation of the methods employed by the Servian administration to "round off" the frontiers of the occupied territory) notes also the predominant state of mind of the army of occupation. According to him "the military party in Servia, with the heir apparent as its head," did not stop here. It "dreams of and works for a 'Great Servia' with the river Strouma at least as its frontier." "To insure possession of the occupied territories the Servians had to discover some compromise with the Greeks, and one was found." Mr. Razsoukanov was the first to make us acquainted with facts now confirmed by the Roumanian "Green Book." He states that-"I am inclined to believe that there was, over and above the treaty concluded between the 'military leagues' of the two countries, a similar agreement between the governments and the armies. That was why General Poutnik went, on March 9/22, to 'inspect' the garrison at Monastir, where there was barely a regiment, and the heir apparent had also gone on two occasions, likewise for 'inspection.' I rather think that in the special train, with which General Poutnik was provided by the Greeks, 'something' was decided between the two allies, to the disadvantage of the absent third: and that it was this special train, Salonica to Monastir, which the General went to 'inspect.' It is a fact that the Servian ambassador at Bucharest did on March 24/April 6, propose to Roumania a treaty of alliance against Bulgaria, and that on April 19/May 2, the Greek ambassador made the same proposition. Mr. Venizelos, on his part, confessed to the Chamber that Prince Nicholas-one of the interlocutors on board the 'special trains,'-as military governor of Salonica, largely contributed in the preparations of the Greek-Servian convention. This convention was concluded on May 16/29."
Evidently war was preparing. The Servian General Staff employed the time in fortifying the central position at Ovtche-Pole. The Greeks, after increasing their Macedonian army by the addition of the regiments released by the capture of Yanina, also tried to take up advanced positions in the area of Bulgarian occupation, at Pravishta and Nigrita. Tile pourparlers with Turkey, which had been resumed in London, were dragged on to give time to complete these preparations. On May 6, the Servian General Staff laid down the preliminary dispositions for concentrating to the east of Uskub. From May 15, a military convention and plan of concerted operations with Greece were under discussion. The Bulgarians, on the other hand, hastened to make peace with the Turks; this agreed, they diverted their armies from Adrianople and Tchataldja towards Macedonia and the Serbo-Bulgarian frontier. On either side preparations were made when a final diplomatic duel took place. Throughout, the opening of hostilities was never lost to sight. On May 12/25, Mr. Pachitch finally despatched to Sofia propositions relative to the revision of the treaty. He justified the new Servian demands by two classes of reasons. First, the clauses of the treaty had been modified in application; secondly, external circumstances not foreseen by the
treaty had profoundly changed its tenor. The clauses of the treaty had been violated by the fact that the Bulgarians had not given the Servians military assistance, while the Servians for their part had aided the Bulgarians. The refusal to leave the Adriatic on the part of the Servians, and the occupations of Adrianople and Thrace by the Bulgarians, constituted two new violations of the treaty. Servia then was entitled to territorial compensation; first, because the Bulgarians had not rendered the promised aid; second, because Servia had assisted the Bulgarians; third, because Servia had lost the Adriatic littoral while Bulgaria had acquired Thrace. This time Mr. Pachitch was in accord with public opinion. This same public opinion had its influence on the Bulgarian government. Since the treaty of February 29/March 13 remained secret, the public could not follow the juridical casuistry based on a commentary on this or that ambiguous phrase in the text. The public renounced the treaty en bloc and would have nothing to do with the "contested zone." If the Servians transgressed the terms of the treaty in their demands Bulgarian diplomatists greatly inclined to act in the same way.If the Servians demanded an outlet on the Aegean as a necessary condition of existence after the loss of their outlet on the Adriatic, and insisted on a coterminous frontier with Greece to secure it, Mr. Danev left the allies and contravened the terms of the treaty when he laid before the Powers in London a demand for a frontier coterminous with Albania in the Debra region. At the same time Mr. Danev went against his ministerial colleagues and followed the military authorities in refusing to hand over Salonica. Austria appeared to have promised it him, after promising the Vardar plain to Servia. Thus on the one hand complications and broils were being introduced by the perversion to megalomania of the National Ideal: on the other (this was the standpoint of Guechov and Theodorov), there was the endeavor to safeguard the alliance. With Servia drawing near to Greece, Bulgaria had to join hands with Roumania if it were not to find itself isolated in the peninsula. This was what Austria Hungary wanted, and it favored the policy. Roumania accepted, but on condition of receiving the recompense assured it by a secret convention with Austria in the event of war with Bulgaria: annexation of the Tourtoukai-Baltchik line. On these conditions Roumania would remain neutral; it even promised military assistance against Turkey! But Turkey was defeated and the Ministry pretended not to want to war with the allies. Why then sacrifice the richest bit of Bulgarian territory? Austria's effort broke against these hypocritical and formal-or too simple-arguments. At bottom war was believed to be inevitable and Russia, it was thought, would do the rest. Russia threatened Bulgaria with Roumanian invasion, if it came to war. By the end of May, 'Russian 'diplomacy made a final effort to avoid conflict. While agreeing to play the part of arbiter within the limits of the alliance, Russia gave counsels of prudence. Go beyond the Servian demands for compensation, they said: despite the implicit promise the Servians made you of demanding nothing 'beyond what
the treaty gave them, agree to cede some towns outside the "contested zone," "beyond" the frontier which they had promised not to "violate."
This Russian solution, which could not satisfy the Servians, had not much chance of being accepted by the Bulgarians. The attitude taken by Russia filled the opposing parties with some doubts as to the impartiality of its arbitration. The Servians were sure that Russia had not forgotten the Bulgaria of San Stefano and the Bulgarians could not use Macedonia as a medium of exchange on the international market. On both sides the conviction was reached that the issue must be sought in armed conflict.
There was. however, one last attempt at avoiding open strife: the two initiators of the treaty of alliance, Pachitch and Guechov, arranged a meeting at Tsaribrod on the frontier. They wanted to try to reach a friendly solution of the difficulties, without any "public" or "Powers." Alas, what was possible in the month of February was no longer so in May. In the first place the "public" of the political parties was there, in Belgrade, and they did not want to leave Pachitch tete-d-tete with the Bulgarian Premier. Before starting for Tsaribrod he had to read to the Skupshtina a summary of his reasons for a revision of the treaty; they were the same he had addressed to Sofia three days earlier (see above). But thus to divulge the secrets of diplomatic correspondence was to cut off the retreat. In such circumstances the speech of May 15/28 was the death-blow to the pacifist hopes of Mr. Guechov on the eve of departure for Tsaribrod. The words attributed to Mr. Pachitch in an interview in an Agram paper are not at all improbable. "I was certain," he is reported to have said, "that the Bulgarians would reply by a declaration of war." Mr. Guechov's situation was hardly more brilliant. He, too, had to fight at Sofia against a war party; but he was not going to make concessions. When he learned on May 17/30 that the Czar Ferdinand had received the leaders of the opposition on the previous evening and received their counsels of war with approval, Mr. Guechov handed in his resignation. Mr. Pachitch did not know that on May 20/June 2, at Tsaribrod, he was speaking to an ex-Minister. Yet another issue or rather a means of delaying events was discovered: to hold a conference of the prime ministers of the allied States. On May 22/June 4, Mr. Guechov's resignation was known to all. With him the last hope of escaping war disappeared.
At this moment the Czar of Russia made a final effort. On May 26/June 8, he sent a telegram to the Kings of Servia and Bulgaria in which, while noting the suggested meeting at Salonica and its eventual continuation at St. Petersburg, he reminded them that they were bound to submit their findings to his arbitrament. He stated solemnly that "the State which begins the war will answer for its conduct to Slavdom." He reserved to himself entire freedom to decide what attitude Russia would take up in view of the "possible consequences of this criminal strife." The secret diplomatic correspondence explains this threat. If Servia will not submit to Russian arbitration "it will risk its existence." If
it is Bulgaria that resists, "it will be attacked, in the war with the allies, by Roumania and Turkey."
The threat was understood at Belgrade but merely created irritation. "Russia holds over us," it was said there, "the ever threatening danger of Austria's neighborhood, and because she knows that if she abandons us, our enemies across the Danube will hasten to exercise the severest pressure upon us, she thinks she can neglect us. * * * All favors go to the Bulgarians. We can not go any further in this direction. We have given way on the Albanian question, we can not give way in Macedonia. We can not condemn ourselves to national suicide because at St. Petersburg or at Tsarskoie-Selo it has been so decided." [These characteristic terms were recorded, some weeks later, at Belgrade by Mr. de Penennrun. See his book, Quamnfe jours de guerre dans les Balkans. Chapelot, Paris, 1914.]
In view of the tendencies of the militarist party, Mr. Pachitch sent in his resignation in his turn, on June 2/15. But the Russian Ambassador, Mr. Hartwig, was there to show the gravity of the situation and persuade the King, the members of the cabinet, the deputies, to yield to Russia's demands and unreservedly accept arbitration. Mr. Pachitch remained, and on June 8/21, Belgrade declared its willingness to accept arbitration; "without inwardly believing in it," as the Agram interviewer adds. And Mr. de Penennrun said "Mr. Pachitch had no more desire than Mr. Danev to betake himself to St. Petersburg. As a matter of fact although he endeavored to put himself in agreement with the critics and opponents in the Skupshtina, at the close of the eventful session of June 17/30, Mr. Pachitch declared that he in no way abandoned the point of view set out in his summary of May 15/28, and had accepted arbitration only because he had become convinced first, that it would proceed on an extended basis rather than within the limits laid down in Art. 4 of the secret annex to the treaty; and second, on condition that the "spheres of direction in Russia" agreed to consider the Greek-Bulgarian conflict at the same time as the Serbo-Bulgarian.
On this point the new allies had agreed; and Mr. Venizelos confirmed it in a paragraph communicated on the same day to the Temps. After Mr. Pachitch's explanations and the subsequent discussion in which the demand voiced was for the annexation of Macedonia rather than for arbitration (Mr. Ribaratz) ; and after it had been stated (Mr. Paul Marinkovits) that "the Servian people would rather trust to its victorious army than to the well known tactlessness of Mr. Pachitch," the Skupshtina reverted to the order of the day of a month previous. It renewed its decision "not to allow the vital interests of Servia to be abused." Mr. Drachkovits explained this condition which he laid down as follows: "The valley of the Vardar is a vital interest for Servia, and any arbitrament which leaves this vital need out of account could not be accepted." Some minutes before. Pachitch received in the chamber the telegram informing him of the
outbreak of hostilities. Turning pale, he withdrew. Arbitration then would not take place; and it would not be Servia's fault.
At Sofia, in fact, for military reasons to be explained, the final agony had been reached more quickly than at Belgrade. Here events were precipitated by conflict between the cabinet and the military party. As to the aim to be attained there was unanimity. The Servians must be forced to carry out the treaty and evacuate Macedonia to the south of the frontier agreed upon. But no agreement could be reached as to the means. Mr. Guechov's favorite tactics were to temporize. We have seen how under the circumstances of debate precious time had been lost both by Guechov and Pachitch. If concessions to Servia were to be made, they ought to have been made in January or at latest in February, when Mr. Pachitch proposed to act apart from the "public and the Powers," and while negotiations would still be undertaken under the most favorable conditions. If no concession was to be made, means should have been devised for resolving by force what it had been determined to regard as a question of force-"eine Macht-frage." It was then time to think of alliances and neutralities and pay for them with temporary concessions. It was necessary to know how not to yield to certain ambitions. Neither one nor the other was done. When Mr. Danev became Prime Minister, he took up with his portfolio an ambiguous position which Mr. Guechov had rightly refused: that of working for war while remaining a partisan of peace. This internal contradiction was bound to act fatally and to paralyze those who believed in action and those who opposed it alike. Mr. Danev, and, to an even greater extent, his colleague, Mr. Theodorov, continued to the end convinced that they could keep all they had acquired. Mr. Danev even wanted to get more-without risking war. The militarists knew better.
A telegram of June 8/21 from General Savov to the commander of the fourth army, describes the state of things as follows:
I. There is an alliance between the Servians and the Greeks whose object is to hold and divide the whole territory of Macedonia on the right bank of the Vardar with the addition of Uskub, Koumanova, Kratovo and Kriva Palonka for the Servians; Salonica and the regions of Pravishta and Nigrita for the Greeks. II. The Servians do not recognize the treaty and do not admit arbitration within the limits of the treaty. III. We insist that the arbitrators start from the basis laid down in the treaty, i. e; concern themselves solely with the contested zone. Since the non-contested territory belongs to us according- to the treaty, we desire that it should be evacuated by the Servians or, at least, occupied by mixed armies for such time as the pourparlers are going on. We make the same proposition to the Greeks. IV. These questions must be settled within ten days and in our sense, or war is inevitable. Thus within ten days we shall have either war or demobilization, according- as the government's demands are accepted or refused. V. If we demobilize now the territories mentioned will remain in the hands of the Greeks and the Servians, since it is difficult to suppose
that they will be peacefully handed over to us. VI. The discontent which has recently manifested itself in certain parts of the army gives ground for supposing that there is a serious agitation against war. The attention of intelligent soldiers must be directed to the fact that should the army become disorganized and incapable of action, the result will be as described in paragraph v. Reply with the least possible delay whether the state of the army is such that it can be counted on for successful operations.
The point of particular interest in this document is the indication afforded of the state of mind of the Bulgarian army, which explains why the commander was particularly anxious to have the question settled. Harvest time approached and the Bulgarian soldier who, after what he had suffered and endured during the long months of winter and spring at Tchataldja and Boulair, had then, instead of returning home, been compelled to join the army on the western frontier, had had enough. One thing or the other: it was war or demobilization: but in any case there must be an immediate decision, for uncertainty had become intolerable. This state of mind was general and several officers told Mr. Bourchier what he repeated in the Times, "If the question is not decided in a week, General Savov will no longer have an army."
It was under these circumstances that Mr. Danev summoned the Council of Ministers on the morning of June 9/22. He told his colleagues that after a sleepless night he had come to the conclusion that since, even after arbitration, it was more than likely that Servia would make war on them, it was better to carry it on now. Were the army once demobilized it would be difficult to bring it together again in the autumn. In such conditions whatever was done must be done at once. Clearly Mr. Danev was expressing the ideas of Savov. Mr. Theodorov's reply was to the point. War between Christians would be shameful after the war of liberation. They ought to go to St. Petersburg: they would get all they wanted there. If, afterwards, the Servians refused to conform to the decision of the arbiter, all Europe would be on Bulgaria's side. All the other ministers plead for peace with one exception,-Mr. Khritov, who represented the war party in the Council and who was not allowed to speak by Mr. Danev, who knew him. Mr. Danev then betook himself to the Czar's summer palace at Vrana, near Sofia, to make his report. General Savov was also present. At three o'clock in the afternoon Mr. Theodorov was summoned to explain the reasons of the "populist" party against war. Mr. Theodorov emphasized the reasons for going to St. Petersburg. Mr. Danev and General Savov gave their consent thereto. They returned to Sofia; the Council was resumed; the Russian Ambassador was summoned and the Council's decision communicated to him. A demand was added, the significance of which is comprehensible enough after what had been said, but which appeared to St. Petersburg in the guise of an ultimatum. The demand was that the arbiter should publish his opinion within sight days. It was added that Mr. Danev would start in three days. This was nearly the "ten days" of Mr. Savov's telegram. Mr. Necloudov then communi-
cated the agreeable news that Servia accepted arbitration unreservedly. The Russian government gave the Servian and Bulgarian governments four days in which to prepare their memoranda for the arbiter. On June 11/24, Mr. Theodorov received a fresh letter from the Bulgarian Embassy at St. Petersburg which strengthened his view and which he read to the Council of Ministers on the same day. It was stated there: "War will be our loss." "The Emperor and the Russian government have decided to arbitrate in conformity with and within the limits of the treaty. It was desirable to come at once since 'the absent are always in the wrong.' Otherwise Russia will not protect you in any way, France will give you no money, England and Germany will abandon you to your own resources. Since in this case Germany stands with the Triple Alliance no one can checkmate Russia's policy; Austria Hungary will not go beyond Platonic promises and Roumania finally will certainly occupy your territories while Russia can not defend you." (This letter referred to a report addressed to Mr. Danev a week previous.)
All this was opportunely said. These prognostics were later confirmed by facts. But those at Sofia who desired war drew one conclusion only,-Russia did not desire a strong Bulgaria; Bulgaria fara da se. The peace party was terrorized by the Macedonian patriots, who threatened to kill Danev at the station when he started for St. Petersburg, and to march the army on Sofia. Public opinion with few exceptions was for war. Under these circumstances the heads of the war party were ready for any risk. The timid and half initiated were told that half measures only were in contemplation, which would lead to skir-mishings such as had frequently occurred with Servians and Greeks on the disputed frontiers. If anyone thought thus, he reckoned without his host.
In order that our silence under Servian attacks may not produce a bad effect on the state of mind of the army, and on the other hand to avoid encouraging the enemy, I order you to attack the enemy all along the line as energetically as possible, without deploying all your forces or producing a prolonged engagement. Try to establish a firm footing on Krivolak on the right bank of the Bregalnitsa. It is preferable that you undertake a fusillade in the evening and make an impetuous attack on the whole line during the night and at daybreak. The operation to be undertaken tomorrow, 16th, in the evening.
The order to the second army is mentioned by General Savov in another telegram sent on the following day, the 16th, and even more interesting as it displays the motives which led the war party to risk action or supplied them with justifications. "In direction 24, I ordered the fourth army to pursue offensive operations and the second army as soon as it had completed its operations on Tchayasa, to begin immediately concentrating on the line marked out in order to attack Salonica. Messieurs the Generals are to bear in mind that our opera-
tions against the Servians and Greeks are undertaken without a formal declaration of war, mainly for the following reasons: (I) to bring the state of mind of the army up to a certain point and put them in a position (literal translation) to regard our allies up to today as enemies; (II) to accelerate the decisions of Russian policy by the fear of war between the allies; (III) to inflict heavy blows upon our adversaries in order to compel them to treat the more readily and make concessions; (IV) since our enemies are in occupation of territories which belong to us let us try by our arms to seize new territory until the European powers intervene to stop our military action. Since early intervention can be foreseen, it is necessary to act quickly and energetically. The fourth army must do all in its power to take Veles at any cost, because of the great political significance of such a conquest. If the operations of the fourth army permit the second will receive the order to attack Salonica."
Re-reading this, the confused and childish reasoning of a general wishing to play the politician, it is now difficult to believe that the questions of war and peace were thus decided. General Savov said later that he merely followed an order-then he was silent. A story was told in his name that the order was given by King Ferdinand, and that he was threatened with a court-martial if he disobeyed it. During the election campaign at the end of 1913 public attention was almost exclusively occupied with the question of responsibility for June 16/29 and people were at great pains to discover the culprit. The investigation is not yet complete, and we need not linger over the more or less probable rumors current. To seek for a single culprit, however, is a mistaken method, inadequate to throw light on the deeper causes of the Bulgarian national catastrophe. Not one day in June alone, but the whole course of the two wars must be surveyed in the search for the culprit. As has been said a war of liberation became a war of conquest for the satisfaction of personal ambition: but its causes, too, lay in strategic necessities; in legitimate tendencies implicit in the traditional national policy; in the auto-hypnosis of a people which had never experienced a reverse and was intoxicated by successes, justly recognized by all the world for their military glory; in a misjudgment of their opponents based on well known facts in the past and ignorance of the present; in a word in that profound belief in their cause and their star which is a part of the national character.
The events which followed on the fatal 16 and 17/29 and 30 June, may be recalled in a few words. On the evening of the 17th the pacificist ministers learned with astonishment that while Mr. Danev was preparing to start for St. Petersburg and a Russian gunboat was waiting at Varna to convey him to Odessa, war had broken out on the frontier. On the morning of the 18th, the Council of Ministers met and after a very lively discussion in the course of which the cabinet threatened to resign, General Savov was forced to give an order stopping the offensive. The General himself was retired for having given the order. At the same time the Russian government tried to stop the move-
ments of the Greek and Servian armies by the exercise of diplomatic pressure at Athens and Belgrade. There being no sanction behind the action, it was ineffectual. Two days before the outbreak of hostilities, Roumania, encouraged by Russia, declared to Bulgaria that she reserved for herself entire liberty of action in the event of war. Full advantage was taken of this, and it soon proved much more difficult to stop Roumania once in action, than to induce her to act. Next, Turkey showed itself more and more aggressive and intransigeant. A veritable avalanche of misfortunes indeed descended upon Bulgaria. A few more dates must be added. On July 1 the Greeks fell upon the Bulgarian garrison at Salonica, massacred several soldiers and took the rest prisoner. The Bulgarians could not hold the positions behind the rivers Zletovska, Bregalnitsa, Kriva Lakavitsa; they were stopped and driven back after several days' assault. On July 7 and 8, the Servian army took the offensive. On July 9, the Servians took Radovitch, the Greeks Strumnitsa. On July 11, the Roumanian army completed its mobilization and crossed the Bulgarian frontier without encountering any opposition. On July 12, the Turkish army of Tchataldja began re-conquering- Thrace. On July 21, it was at Lule Bourgas and Kirk Kilisse; on the 22d, it recaptured Adrianople, which had been hastily evacuated by the Bulgarians. On July 14, the Servians took Kriva Palanka. On July 11, Bulgaria made its first appeal for help to Europe. On the 23d of July, Ferdinand appealed to the Czar to mediate. Without waiting for the results of this last proposal Mr. Danev resigned in despair. On the 15th during the five days of the crisis the enemies' armies continued their march and the Roumanians advanced on Sofia. A telegram from King Ferdinand to Francis Joseph demanded mediation for Roumania: on his advice, Ferdinand sent a telegram directly to King Carol. He demanded the cession of the triangle Danube-Tourtoukai-Baltchik as the condition of peace. His proposition was accepted on July 21, but the Bulgarians had still to fight the Greeks who had reached the frontiers of the Kingdom at Djoumaya (25-30), while the Servians were besieging Vidine. Negotiations were at last opened at Bucharest on July 30, and a five days' armistice signed at mid-day on July 31. On August 4 it was extended for four days. The Peace of Bucharest was signed on August 10, and peace with Turkey concluded September 29, 1913. The reader may compare the boundaries established by these treaties (see the map) with the areas of occupation three months before the war. The extent of Bulgaria's losses is clear. Those who won claimed that "balance in the Balkans" had been secured, an end made of pretensions to hegemony, and peace thus secured for the future. Unhappily a nearer examination leads rather to the conclusion that the treaty of Bucharest has created a condition of things that is far from being durable. If the Bulgarian "conquest" is almost annulled by it, the Greek and Servian "conquests" are not well established. A later chapter (The War and the Nationalities) will afford abundant proof of this, and to it we refer the reader for conclusions.
The first of the Balkan campaigns was accepted by European opinion as a War of Liberation. It meant the downfall on one continent of the Turkish Empire; it was easy, as victory succeeded victory, to believe that it meant also the end of all the oppressions of race by race which for five centuries had made the history of the Balkans a record of rebellion, repression, and massacre. On a close view of what happened in Macedonia, as the Balkan armies marched southward, this War of Liberation assumes a more sordid and familiar aspect. It unleashed the accumulated hatreds, the inherited revenges of centuries. It made the oppressed Christians for several months the masters and judges of their Moslem overlords. It gave the opportunity of vengeance to every peasant who cherished a grudge against a harsh landlord or a brutal neighbor. Every Bulgarian village in northern Macedonia had its memory of sufferings and wrongs. For a generation the insurgent organization had been busy, and the normal condition of these villages had been one of intermittent revolt. The inevitable Turkish reprisals had fallen now on one village and now on another. Searches for arms, heatings, tortures, wholesale arrests, and occasional massacres, were the price which these peasants paid for their incessant struggle toward self-government. In all these incidents of repression, the local Moslems had played their part, marching behind the Turkish troops as bashi-bazouks and joining in the work of pillage and slaughter. Their record was not forgotten when the Bulgarian victories brought the chance of revenge. To the hatred of races there was added the resentment of the peasantry against the landlords (beys), who for generations had levied a heavy tribute on their labor and their harvests. The defeat of the Turkish armies meant something more than a political change. It reversed the relations of conqueror and serf; it promised a social revolution.
Only the utmost vigilance exercised by a disciplined army and a resolute police could have checked the natural impulse toward vengeance among the liberated Macedonians. In point of fact, the measures adopted by the Bulgarian government to protect the local Moslem population in northern and central Macedonia were inadequate and belated. The regular army was not numerous, and it marched rapidly southwards toward Salonica, leaving no sufficient garrisons behind it. No attempt had been made to embody the insurgent bands in
regular corps, and they were left free over a broad and populous area to deal with the local Turks as their own instincts dictated. Civil officials arrived to organize a regular administration in some cases a full six weeks after the Turkish authority had disappeared. It is not surprising in these conditions, that the Moslem population endured during the early weeks of the war a period of lawless vengeance and unmeasured suffering. In many districts the Moslem villages were systematically burned by their Christian neighbors. Nor was it only the regions occupied by the Bulgarians which suffered. In the province of Monastir, occupied by the Serbs and Greeks, the agents of the (British) Macedonian Relief Fund calculated that eighty per cent of Moslem villages were burned. Salonica, Monastir, and Uskub were thronged with thousands of homeless and starving Moslem refugees, many of whom emigrated to Asia. The Moslem quarter of the town of Jenidje Vardar was almost totally burned down, in spite of the fact that this town was occupied by the main Greek army. Even in the immediate neighborhood of Salonica, Moslem villages were burned by the Greek troops. (See Appendix A, No. 12.) The Greek population of the Drama district indulged in robbery, murder and violation at the expense of the Moslem inhabitants, until order was restored by an energetic Bulgarian prefect. (See Appendix B, No. 16.)
A curious document (Appendix A, No. 13a) drawn up by the officials of the Moslem community of Pravishta and sealed with its seal, gives a vivid impression of a kind of persecution which we believe to have been normal in the early months of the first war. The district of Pravishta lies along the coast to the west of Kavala and is inhabited by about 20,000 Moslems and about 7,000 Greeks. It was occupied at first by Bulgarian bands under a voyevoda (chief) named Baptchev, and afterwards in part by Bulgarian and in part by Greek troops. Such civil administration as there was in the early stages of the conquest was conducted by the Greek Bishop, whom Baptchev obeyed, though with some measure of independence. This document gives particulars, village by village, of the Moslems who were killed and robbed. The lists are detailed, and give the names not only of the victims but of the assassins. Some of the particulars of the robberies are also given in great detail, and in one village even the color of the stolen cows is stated. Our experience shows that lists of this kind in the Balkans are usually accurate. Exaggeration begins only when peasants attempt to give estimates in round numbers. The number of Moslems killed in each village varied from one to twenty-five, and the damage done by robbery and looting from hundreds to thousands of pounds.
In the villages all these excesses seem to have been the work of local Greek bands. The most active of these bands was led by a priest and a warlike grocer who was a member of the Bishop's council. The Turks indeed accuse the Bishop of directing all these atrocities. The total number of Moslems killed is 195. Baptchev, in contrast to some other Bulgarian leaders of bands,
appears to have behaved relatively well. His exactions or robberies amounted to about ЈT6,000, but he killed only in ten cases after the Bishop and his Council had passed sentence, and it is said of him and his men that they did no violence to women, and even rescued two from the Greeks. It is also said that Moslem women fled to escape violation from villages held by Greek troops to villages held by Bulgarian soldiers. While we think it probable that this document is accurate and truthful, it must be remembered that it is an ex parte statement. The Turks imply that the motive for the slaughter was simply a desire to intimidate their community by striking at its heads. But it is likely that the local Greeks had long standing grievances against many of these Turks. Vengeance and cupidity had probably as much to do with these excesses as policy. No villages appear to have been burned in this district, but enough was done to make the local Moslems feel that their lot was unendurable.
The burning of villages and the exodus of the defeated population is a normal and traditional incident of all Balkan wars and insurrections. It is the habit of all these peoples. What they have suffered themselves, they inflict in turn upon others. It could have been avoided only by imperative orders from Athens, Belgrade, and Sofia, and only then if the church and the insurgent organization had seconded the resolve of the governments. A general appeal for humanity was in fact published by the Macedonian insurgent "Internal Organization," but it appears to have produced little effect.
Devastation, unfortunately, was not the worst of the incidents which stained the War of Liberation. More particularly in northeastern Macedonia the victorious population undertook a systematic proscription of the Moslems. The Commission has before it full evidence of one of these campaigns of murder at Strumnitsa. It was probably the worst incident of its kind, but it is typical of much that happened elsewhere on a smaller scale. Our information comes (1) from the surviving Moslem notables of the town, who gave us their evidence personally (see Appendix A, Nos. 1 and 2); (2) from an American gentleman who visited the town shortly afterwards; and (3) from a Bulgarian official. Strumnitsa in the autumn of 1912 was under a mixed control; the garrison was Servian; there was a junior Bulgarian civil official; and Bulgarian insurgents were present in large numbers. A commission was formed under the presidency of the Servian commander, Major Grbits, and with him there sat two junior Servian officers, the Bulgarian sub-prefect Lieutenant Nicholas Voultchev, the leader of the Bulgarian bands, voyevoda Tchekov (or Jekov), and some of the leading inhabitants. The local Moslems of the town were disarmed by a house to house search. Some indiscriminate killing of Moslems took place in the streets, and thereafter an order was issued forbidding any Moslem to leave his house, under pain of death. A local gendarmerie was meanwhile organized, and while the Moslems passively awaited their fate, a gendarme and a Servian soldier went from house to house summoning them one by one before the commis-
sion. As each victim came before the judges, Major Grbits inquired, "Is he good, or is he bad?"There was no discussion and no defense. Each member had his personal enemies, and no one ventured to interfere with his neighbor's resentments. One voice sufficed to condemn. Hardly one in ten of those who were summoned escaped the death sentence. The victims were roughly stripped of their outer clothing and bound in the presence of the commission, while the money found on them was taken by Major Grbits. The condemned Moslems were bound in threes, taken to the slaughter house and there killed, in some cases after torture and mutilation. The fortunate minority received a certificate which permitted them to live, and in many cases there is reason to believe that as much as ЈT100 was paid for it. The motive behind these atrocities was clearly as much cupidity as race hatred. The victims included not only the citizens of Strumnitsa, but also a large number of fugitives and prisoners from the surrounding villages. Our Turkish witnesses place the total of killed at the improbable figure of 3,000 to 4,000-a guesswork estimate. Our American and Bulgarian informants, who were both in a position to make a careful calculation, placed the total of those killed in this proscription at from seven to eight hundred. It is fair to add that steps were afterwards taken by the Bulgarian courts-martial to prosecute the guilty Bulgarian official, Voultchev, and the Bulgarian chief of bands, Tchekov, and a third person named Manov. All three have been sentenced to fifteen years' hard labor. The Servian government, on the other hand, has inflicted no punishment on Major Grbits, who was the senior officer and the person ultimately responsible for these atrocities.
The result of leaving Bulgarian bands at large with no adequate control was, if possible, still worse in the Kukush (Kilkish) region. Only a few Bulgarian regulars were left to garrison the town during the early weeks of the war, and the only authority which could make itself obeyed was that which the chief of bands, Toma of Istip, exercised with the aid of a commission of local Bulgarian notables. It drew up lists for the whole district, in which each of the Moslem inhabitants was rated at a certain figure, which might be represented as a poll-tax, but was in effect a ransom. To pay this ransom the Turks were often obliged to sell everything they possessed. Later, a band arrived under a certain Donchev, a notoriously cruel guerrilla chief, who acted on his own responsibility and has been disavowed and sentenced to death by the Macedonian revolutionary "internal organization." He is said to have burned 345 Turkish houses in one day in the villages of Raionovo, Planitsa, and Kukurtevo, shut up the men in the mosques and burned them alive or shot them down as they attempted to escape. It is said that Donchev's band massacred women and children; and this statement also is credited by Europeans who have ample local sources of information. An account of these events by Pere Michel, the head of the French Catholic mission at Kukush, has been published. (See Appendix A, No. 6.) It was misused and distorted in some Greek and French newspapers,
as though it referred to the doings of the Bulgarian regular army shortly before the second war. It was undoubtedly a truthful account of the excesses of the Bulgarian bands during the autumn of 1912.
A statement from a local Turk, who was recommended to us as an honest witness by a European resident, will be found in Appendix A (No. 7). Pere Michel's statements, it should be added, were generally corroborated by the Protestant missionaries who worked in the same district. The Bulgarian bands in the Kukush region were left for some weeks unmolested in this work of extortion and extermination. There is ample proof that they slaughtered many hundreds of disarmed and disbanded Turkish soldiers, who had surrendered to the Greeks at Salonica, and were traveling through Kukush on their way to their homes in northern Macedonia.
The responsibility of the regular Bulgarian authorities is more directly indicated in the massacre of Turks which took place in the town of Serres shortly after its capture. Here there was an adequate Bulgarian garrison, and a regular administration. We have before us a full statement from the President of the Turkish community of Serres, which is confirmed by the Austrian vice-consul (a Greek), and other Greek residents. Their evidence is inevitably biased and exaggerated, but it was unfortunately confirmed in its main outlines by a confidential statement made to us by an American gentleman, who was active after the massacre in relieving the distress among the Moslems. The events which preceded the massacre are very obscure. Mysterious shots were fired, and a large number of Turkish soldiers were supposed (we do not know with what truth) to be in hiding in the town. On a charitable reading of the facts it is fair to suppose that the Bulgarian authorities feared a revolt. This may explain but can not excuse the slaughter which followed. The Turkish version of this affair will be found in Appendix A (No. 8). The estimates given by Turks and Greeks, which range from 600 to 5,000 killed, are certainly exaggerated. Our American informant, a cautious and fair-minded man, with a long and intimate experience of Macedonia, believed that the number of killed in the town was, at most two hundred. He insisted, however, that the massacre was deliberate and unprovoked, and that it was accompanied by pillage on a large scale and by the violation of many Turkish women and children. Similar excesses were perpetrated in the villages. The instruments of this atrocity were chiefly Macedonian insurgents (comitadjis), but they acted under the eyes of the Bulgarian military authorities, who had in Serres a regular force sufficient to control them.
These instances should suffice to give some idea of the sufferings of the Moslem population during the early weeks of the occupation. It would unfortunately be easy to multiply them. Details will be found in the Appendices of a minor massacre, much exaggerated in the press, carried out at Dedeagatch by the dregs of the local Christian population (Greeks and Armenians) with
the aid of some Bulgarian privates of the Macedonian legion, who were accidentally left in the town without an officer (Appendix A, Nos. 9 and 10). A Bulgarian eye witness described to us the killing of a large number of local Turks at Uskub by Servians in the early days of the occupation (Appendix A, No. 11).
Incidents also occurred while Bulgarian regiments were on the march which led to savage reprisals. A volunteer of the Macedonian legion (Opolchenie), who was previously known to a member of the Commission as an honorable and truthful man, recounted the following incident as the one example of brutality which had come within his own experience. While marching through Gumurjina, the legion saw the dead bodies of about fifty murdered Bulgarian peasants. The dead body of a woman was hanging from a tree, and another with a young baby lay dead on the ground with their eyes gouged out. The men of the legion retaliated by shooting all the Turkish villagers or disbanded soldiers whom they met next day on their march, and killed in this way probably some fifty men and two or three women. The officers of the legion endeavored afterwards to discover the culprits, but were baffled by the solidarity of the men, who considered this butchery a legitimate reprisal. The Turks with whom we talked were on the whole agreed that the period of extreme brutality was confined to the early weeks of the first war. Many of them praised the justice of the regular Bulgarian administration which was afterwards established. From several of the Bulgarian officials who had to govern turbulent districts (e. g., Istip and Drama) infested by bands with an inadequate military force to back them, we have heard in detail of the steps which they took to regain the confidence of the Moslems. Many of them were successful.
A real effort was undoubtedly made to check the lawlessness of the bands and to deal with marauding on the part of the troops. The records of the courts-martial which we have before us, show that it was in January, 1913, that the Bulgarian headquarters became alarmed at the frequency and gravity of the excesses reported from the occupied territories. A circular telegram (see Appendix A, No. 13) sent to commanders and governors in Macedonia and Thrace enjoined them to institute inquiries into all excesses committed against the inhabitants of the occupied territories, and reminded them that the honor of the army was at stake, and that an attitude of indifference on their part toward the crimes of individuals would lead the world to suppose that Bulgarian civilization was not superior to that of the enemy. In two later telegrams the courts-martial were instructed to deal promptly with such charges and to give precedence to such cases over all others, more especially where the complaints came from Turks. The tone of these instructions is all that could be desired. It is disappointing to learn that up to February 15, 1913, the courts-martial in Macedonia had passed sentence on only ten persons for murder, eight for robbery or pillage, and two for rape. A large number of cases was in the stage of inquiry ("instruction"), and these included seventy-eight cases of murder, sixty-nine of pillage, seven of
rape, seven of robbery, disguised as taxation, fourteen of arson, and eighty-one of various kinds of robbery and dishonesty. Of the culprits thirty-seven were Macedonian insurgents, including six chiefs of bands (voyevodas). How many of these cases were completed and how many of the culprits were actually sentenced we do not precisely know, since the archives of the chief Macedonian court-martial were lost at the evacuation of Serres. But we are informed that more than 200 prisoners belonging to the Bulgarian army and to the irregular bands were in Serres gaol under sentence when the town was evacuated. There is reason to believe that they were then released, an unfortunate irregularity which may possibly have been unavoidable. These facts show that an effort was made upon a considerable scale in Macedonia to deal with the excesses committed against the Turkish population. It was somewhat tardy, and manifestly the prompt execution in the early weeks of the war of some of the more notable criminals would have produced a more salutary effect. Public opinion in the Balkans does not condemn excesses committed by Christians against Moslems as severely as neutral onlookers do. That is inevitable, given the historical conditions. But undoubtedly the chiefs of the Bulgarian army did make an attempt to clear its honor, and the attempt was successful in bringing about a great improvement in the conduct of the troops and their irregular allies. It is, moreover, creditable to the Bulgarian government that in order to check the spoliation of the Moslems, an edict was issued which made all transfers of land during the period of the war illegal and invalid.
It remains to mention the practice followed by the Bulgarians, over a wide area, of reconverting the pomaks by force to Christianity. The pomaks are Bulgarians by race and language, who at some period of the Turkish conquest were converted by force to Islam. They speak no Turkish, and retain some traditional memory of their Christian past; but circumstances have usually made them fanatical Mohammedans. They number in the newly conquered territories at least 80,000 persons, and are chiefly concentrated to the north and east of Nevrocop. The Bulgarian Holy Synod conceived the design of converting them en masse, and it was frequently able to reckon on the support of the military and civil authorities, not to mention the insurgent bands. It was not usually necessary to employ actual violence; threats, backed by the manifest power to enforce them, commonly sufficed to induce whole villages to submit to the ceremony of baptism. The policy was carried out systematically, and long before the outbreak of the second war, the pomaks in most districts conformed outwardly to the Bulgarian church, and listened with a show of docility to the ministrations of the priests and nuns sent by the Holy Synod to instruct them in the tenets of Christianity. This aberration, in sharp contrast to the toleration which the Bulgarian Kingdom has usually shown to the Moslems within its frontiers, must rank among the least excusable brutalities of the war. The Holy Synod argued that since force had been used to convert the pomaks to
Islam, force might fairly be used to reverse the process. The argument is one proof the more that races whose minds have been molded for centuries by the law of reprisal and the practice of vengeance, tend to a common level of degradation.
The charges brought by the Greeks against the Bulgarians are already painfully familiar to every newspaper reader. Unlike the Bulgarians, the Greeks welcomed war correspondents, and every resource of publicity was at their disposal, while Bulgaria itself was isolated and its telegraphic communications cut. That some of these accusations were grossly exaggerated is now apparent. Le Temps, for example, reported the murder of the Greek Bishop of Doiran. We saw him vigorous and apparently alive two months afterwards. A requiem mass was sung for the Bishop of Kavala; his flock welcomed him back to them while we were in Salonica. The correspondent of the same newspaper stated that he personally assisted at the burial of the Archbishop of Serres, who was savagely mutilated before he was killed. (Letter, dated Livonovo, July 23.) This distressing experience in no way caused this prelate to interrupt his duties, which he still performs.
There none the less remains, when these manifest travesties of fact are brushed aside, a heavy indictment which rests upon uncontrovertible evidence. It is true that the little town of Doxato was burned and a massacre carried out there during and after a Bulgarian attack. It is true that the town of Serres was burned during a Bulgarian attack. It is also true that a large number of civilians, including the Bishop of Melnik and Demir-Hissar, were slaughtered or executed by the Bulgarians in the latter town. The task of the Commission has been to compare the evidence from both sides regarding these events, and to form a judgment on the circumstances which in some degree explain them. The Greek charges are in each case substantially true, but in no case do they state the whole truth.
In forming an opinion upon the series of excesses which marked the Bulgarian withdrawal from southeastern Macedonia, it is necessary to recall the fact that the Bulgarians were here occupying a country whose population is mainly Greek and Turkish. The Bulgarian garrisons were small, and they found themselves on the outbreak of the second war in a hostile country. The Greek population of these regions is wealthy and intensely patriotic. In several Greek centers insurgent organizations (andartes) existed. Arms had been collected, and some experienced guerrilla chiefs were believed to be in hiding, and ready to lead the local population. All of this in existing conditions was creditable to Greek patriotism; their race was at war with Bulgarians, and the more enterprising and courageous among them intended to take their share as auxiliaries Of the Greek army in driving the Bulgarians from their country. From a nation-
alist standpoint, this was morally their right and some might even say their duty. But it is equally clear that the Bulgarians, wherever they found themselves opposed by the armed civil population, had also a right to take steps to protect themselves. The steps which they elected to take in some places grossly exceeded the limits of legitimate defense or allowable reprisal.
Doxato was a thriving country town, situated between Drama and Kavala in the center of a rich tobacco growing district. It had a large school, and counted several wealthy and educated families among its 2,700 Greek inhabitants. It was proud of its Hellenic character, and formed with two neighboring villages a compact Greek island in a rural population which was almost exclusively Turkish. A member of the Commission has visited its ruins. Only thirty homes are left intact among its 270 Greek houses. Enough remains of the walls to show that the little town was well built and prosperous, and to suggest that the conflagration must have caused grievous material loss to the inhabitants. The estimate of killed (at first said to number over 2,000) which is now generally accepted by the Greeks, is 600. We have had communicated to us an extract from an official Greek report in which 500 is given as an outside figure.
A large proportion, probably one-half, of this total consisted of civilians who had taken up arms. Women and children to the number of over a hundred were massacred in a single house, and the slaughter was carried out with every
conceivable circumstance of barbarity. We print in Appendix B (No. 14) a letter in which Commander Cardale, a British naval officer in the Greek service, describes the condition of the village when he visited it shortly after the massacre.
We print in Appendix B, Bulgarian accounts of the Doxato affair. Mr. Dobrev, who was the prefect of Drama and earned the good opinion of the Greeks by his conduct there (see the Greek pamphlet Atrocites Bulgares, p. 49), has told the whole story with evident frankness. (Appendix B, No. 16.)Captain Sofroniev of the Royal Guard, who commanded the two squadrons of cavalry which operated against Doxato, relates his own part in the affair clearly, and has shown us the reports of his scouts penciled on official paper. (See Appendix B, No. 15.) Lieutenant Milev in a communicated deposition describes his experiences with the infantry, and Lieutenant Colonel Barnev explains his military dispositions. (See Appendix B, Nos. 16a and 16b.) These four depositions leave no doubt in the mind of the Commission that the Greeks had organized a formidable military movement among the local population; that Doxato was one of its centers; and that several hundreds of armed men were concentrated there. Provocation had been given not only by the wanton and barbarous slaughter by Greeks of Moslem noncombatants, but also by a successful attack at Doxato upon a Bulgarian convoy. There was, therefore, justification for the order given From the Bulgarian headquarters to attack the Greek insurgents concentrated in Doxato.
It appears from Captain Sofroniev's report that his men met with an obstinate resistance from these Greek andartes and that one of his two squadrons lost seventeen killed and twenty-four wounded in the attack. In the charge b\ which he finally dispersed them, he believes that his men killed at least 150 Greeks, and perhaps double this number. These were, he assures us, all armed men and combatants.
We find it hard to believe that an irregular and inexperienced force can have resisted cavalry with an obstinacy that would justify so large a slaughter as this. A woman, moreover, was wounded in this charge. (See Appendix B, No. 16.) Captain Sofroniev states that his men took prisoners. He consigned these prisoners to the charge of the Turkish peasants who had come up from neighboring villages, full of resentment for Greek excesses against their neighbors. He allowed these Turks to arm themselves with the weapons of the defeated Greek insurgents. He might as well have ordered the massacre of his prisoners. These Turks had recent grievances against the Greeks, and they had come to Doxato in the rear of the Bulgarian force for pillage and revenge.
The cavalry operated outside the village. The force which entered it was an infantry detachment comprised in great part of Bulgarian Moslems (pomaks). According to Mr. Dobrev, who is clearly the franker witness, it became excited when a magazine of cartridges exploded in the village, and began to kill indiscriminately all the inhabitants whom it met in the streets, including some children. It remained, however, only a short while in Doxato.
Lieutenant Milev's account attributes this slaughter to the local Turks, and states that two of them were executed for their crimes. He represents the inhabitants whom his men killed as insurgents.
We can not explain this discrepancy. It is, however, clear that the systematic massacre was carried out by the local Turks who were left in possession of the place for the better part of two days.They pillaged, burned, and slaughtered at their leisure, nor did they spare even the women who had taken refuge in the houses of friendly Turks. So far there is little difference between Commander Cardale's version of events, based on local Greek sources, and the statements of our Bulgarian witnesses. What we heard ourselves in the village some weeks later agreed with what Commander Car-dale has reported. The Bulgarian troops, after a sharp engagement, began the killing of the inhabitants, but presently desisted. "The greater part of the massacre," as Commander Cardale puts it, "was done by the Turks." He quotes, without endorsing it, the statement of the survivors that the Turks acted under the "direction" or "incitement" of Bulgarian officers. We gather that he heard no convincing evidence on this head, nor did we meet with anyone who had personally heard or seen Bulgarian officers giving directions to massacre. That charge may be dismissed as baseless. But some part of the responsibility for ;he slaughter falls, none the less, upon the Bulgarian officers. They armed the 1'urks and left them in control of the village. They must have known what would follow. The employment of Turkish bashi-bazouks as allies against de-
fenseless Christian villagers was an offense of which Greeks, Servians, and Bulgarians were all guilty upon occasion. No officer in the Balkans could take this step without foreseeing that massacre must result from it.
It is fair none the less to note that the Bulgarians were in a difficult position. They could not occupy the village permanently, for they were threatened by Greek columns marching from several quarters. To leave the Turks unarmed was to expose them to Greek excesses. To arm the Turks was, on the other hand, to condemn the Greek inhabitants to massacre. A culpable error of judgment was committed in circumstances which admitted only of a choice of evils. While emphasizing the heavy responsibility which falls on the Bulgarian officers for this catastrophe, we do not hesitate to conclude that the massacre at Doxato was a Turkish and not a Bulgarian atrocity.
Serres is the largest town of the interior of eastern Macedonia. The tobacco trade had brought considerable wealth to its 30,000 inhabitants; and it possessed in its churches, schools and hospitals the outward signs of the public spirit of its Greek community. The villages around it are Bulgarian to the north and west, but a rural Greek population approaches it from the south and east. The town itself is predominantly Greek, with the usual Jewish and Turkish admixture. The Bulgarians formed but a small minority. From October to June the town was under a Bulgarian occupation, and as the second war drew near, the relations of the garrison and the citizens became increasingly hostile. The Bulgarian authorities believed that the Greeks were arming secretly, that andartes (Greek insurgents) were concealed in the town, and that a revolt was in preparation. Five notables of the town were arrested on July 1 with the idea of intimidating the population. On Friday, July 4, the defeat of the Bulgarian forces to the south of Serres rendered the position untenable, and arrangements were made for the evacuation of the town. General Voulkov, the Governor of Macedonia, and his staff left on the evening of Saturday, July 5. The retirement was hastily planned and ill executed. There is evidence from Greeks and Turks, and from one of the American residents, Mr. Moore, that some of the troops found time to pillage before withdrawing. On the other hand, stores of Bulgarian munitions, including rifles, were abandoned in the town, and some of the archives were also left behind. We gather that there was some conflict of authority among the superior Bulgarian officers. (See evidence of Commandant Moustakov, Appendix B, No. 26.)
The plain fact is that at this central point the organization and discipline of the Bulgarian troops broke down. Some excesses, as one would expect, undoubtedly occurred, but the Greek evidence on this matter is untrustworthy. Commandant Moustakov believes that the notables who had been arrested were released. We find, on the other hand, in the semiofficial Greek pamphlet Atrocites
Bulgares, the statement (p. 25) that the bodies of four Greek notables were found outside the town killed by bayonet thrusts; among them was the corpse of the director of the Orient bank. For this assertion the authority of the Italian and Austrian consuls general of Salonica is claimed. (See Appendix B, No. 17.) The member of our Commission who visited Serres had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman, Mr. Ghine, alive, well, and unharmed, and enjoyed his hospitality. Such discoveries as this are a warning that even official statements regarding these events must be subjected to careful scrutiny. On the other hand, there is no doubt that some of the prisoners who were in gaol when the Bulgarians left the town, were slaughtered. This was done presumably by their gaolers without orders. The imprisoned Bulgarians, including many comitadjis, were probably released; it is conceivable that they had a hand in these excesses. The fact of a butchery in the prison is placed beyond doubt by the evidence of Mr. Arrington, the manager of the American Tobacco Company's branch. His porter (cavass), a Greek, had been arrested some days before, apparently because a rumor had got abroad that the famous Greek guerrilla chief. Captain Doukas, was in the town disguised as the cavass of a tobacco warehouse. Mr. Arrington demanded the release of his employee without result. After the departure of the last of the Bulgarian troops, Mr. Arrington visited the prison and found there a heap of thirteen corpses, among which was his man, severely wounded. He died shortly afterwards in hospital, but was able to tell his story. His Bulgarian gaoler had demanded a ransom of ,?10 for his release and would allow him
no facilities to procure it from outside. "We do things methodically here said the gaoler. "You have four hours to live. Every half hour you will b beaten, and at the end you will be killed." He was in fact made to lie on hi back and was pinned to the floor with a bayonet. Mr. Arrington stated that hi arms and back, where he had been beaten, were "as black as his boots." The other twelve prisoners had evidently been treated with equal barbarity.
The main body of the Bulgarian garrison, with the headquarters, withdrew from Serres on Saturday, July 5. A panic followed, and a squadron of dismounted Bulgarian cavalry paraded the town to maintain order. The Greek irregulars and armed citizens were already under arms, and fired from some
of the houses at this squadron. It camped that night outside the town, and entered it again on Sunday, but apparently without attempting to maintain complete control. On Monday, July 7 (if not on Sunday), the effective authority passed into the hands of the local Greeks. The Archbishop was recognized as governor of the town, and at his palace there sat in permanence a commission of the local inhabitants. Thirty armed Greeks wearing the evzone (highlander) uniform, who were, however, probably irregulars (andartes), had arrived in Serres, and one witness states that they were under the command of Captain Doukas. A Russian doctor in the Bulgarian sanitary service (Dr. Klugmann, see Appendix B, No. 22), who was left in the town, heard on Monday a Greek priest summoning the inhabitants to the Bishop's palace, where arms were
distributed, first to the Greeks, and later to the Turks. From Monday morning to Thursday evening these Greek irregulars and the citizen militia which they organized were in possession of the town. Thrice they were threatened by small Bulgarian detachments, which returned and skirmished on the hills outside the town and at the distant railway station. But these Bulgarian scouts were not a sufficient force to enter the town. A telegram dispatched on Thursday by :he Archbishop to King Constantine (see Le Temps, July 13), begs him to hasten ;o occupy the town, which is, he says, defending itself successfully against the
attacks of the Bulgarians. He mentions that he is governing the town and states that it has been abandoned for a week by the Bulgarian authorities. He fears, however, that the citizens' power of resistance may soon be exhausted. These rather aimless Bulgarian attacks must have contributed to excite the local Greeks, and to inflame a spirit of vengeance.
The main concern of the Archbishop's Greek militia during this week was apparently to hunt down the Bulgarian population within the town and in some of the neighboring villages. It is conceivable that this measure may have been dictated in the first instance by the fear that the small Bulgarian minority inside Serres would cooperate with the enemy who attacked it from without. An armed Greek mob followed a few uniformed men from house to house, threatening the Bulgarians and all who should assist them to hide. Their houses were pillaged and their wives ill treated, while the men were arrested and taken singly or in batches to the Bishop's palace; there they were brought before a commission of laymen over whom a priest presided. Whatever money they possessed was taken from them by this priest, and the only question asked about them was, whether they were or were not Bulgarians. This process was witnessed by Dr. Klugmann, and the testimony of this Russian doctor entirely confirms that of our Bulgarian peasant witnesses. From the bishopric the prisoners were taken to the neighboring Greek girls' high school. In the school they were closely confined in several rooms by fifties and sixties. Fresh batches arrived continuously from the town and from the villages, until the total number of imprisoned Bulgarians reached 200 or 250. The gaolers were in part citizens of Serres, some of whom can be named, and in part uniformed irregulars. From the first they behaved with gross cruelty. The prisoners were tightly bound and beaten with the butt ends of rifles. The plan of the gaolers was apparently to slaughter their prisoners in batches, and they were led two by two to an upper room, where they were killed, usually by repeated wounds in the head and neck inflicted with a butcher's knife or a Martini bayonet. Each of the butchers aimed at accounting for fourteen men, which was apparently the number which each could bury during the night. The massacre went on in this leisurely way until Friday, the 11th. The prisoners included a few captured Bulgarian soldiers, a few peasants taken with arms in their hands (see evidence of the villager Lazarov, Appendix B, No. 20), and at least one local Bulgarian, Christo Dimitrov (Appendix B, No. 19), who was known to be an active associate of the Bulgarian bands. The immense majority were, however, inoffensive tradesmen or. peasants whose only offense was that they were Bulgarians. Among them were four women, who were killed with the rest. The only mitigating circumstance is that five lads were released in pity for their youth, after seeing their fathers killed before their eyes. (See Blagoi Petrov, Appendix B, No. 21.) We are unwilling to dwell on the detailed barbarities of this butchery, of which more than enough is recorded in the appendices.
We must here anticipate a part of the narrative to explain that in the early morning of Friday, July 11, a Bulgarian regular force with cavalry and light artillery reached Serres, engaged the militia outside the town, defeated it, and began toward noon to penetrate into the town itself. There were still sixty or seventy of the Bulgarian prisoners alive, and their gaolers, alarmed by the sound of cannon in the distance, resolved to finish their work rapidly. Two at least of the prisoners (Angelov and Limonov) contrived to overpower the sentinels and escaped. Some of them, however, were bound and others were too enfeebled or too terrified to save themselves. They were led to the slaughter by fours and fives, but the killing this day was inefficient, and at least ten of the prisoners fell among the heaps of corpses, severely wounded indeed, but still alive. They recovered consciousness in the early afternoon, to realize that their gaolers had fled, that the town was on fire, and that the Bulgarian troops were not far distant. Ten of them struggled out of the school, and eight had strength enough to reach safety and their countrymen.
The Commission saw three of these fugitives from the Serres massacre, (Karanfilov, Dimitrov, and Lazarov, Appendix B, Nos. 18, 19, 20), who all bore the fresh scars of their wounds. These wounds, chiefly in the head and neck, could have been received only at close quarters. They were such wounds as a I butcher would inflict, who was attempting to slaughter men as he would slaughter sheep. The evidence of these three, given separately, was mutually consistent, We questioned a fourth witness, the lad Blagoi Petrov, who was released. We were also supplied with the written depositions, backed by photographs showing their injuries, of three other wounded survivors of the massacre, who had found refuge in distant parts of Bulgaria which we were unable to visit. (See Appendix D, Nos. 56, 57, 58.) Among these was George Belev, a Protestant, to whose honesty and high character the American missionaries of Samakov paid a high tribute. The written depositions of the two men who escaped by rushing the sentinels, afforded another element of confirmation. Dr. Klugmann's evidence, given to us in person, is valuable as a description of the way in which the Bulgarian civilians of Serres were hunted down and arrested. The Commission finds this evidence irresistible, and is forced to conclude that a massacre of Bulgarians to the number of about two hundred, most of them inoffensive and noncombatant civilians, was carried out in Serres by the Greek militia with revolting cruelty. The victims were arrested and imprisoned under the authority of the Archbishop. It is possible that he may have been misled by his subordinates, and that they may have disobeyed his orders. But the fact that when he visited the prison on Thursday, he assured the survivors that their lives would be spared, suggests that he knew that they were in danger.
The last stage of the episode of Serres began on Friday, the 11th. Partly because they had left large stores of munitions in the town, partly because rumors of the schoolhouse massacre had reached them, the Bulgarians were anx-
ious to reoccupy the town. Their small detachments had been repulsed and it was with a battalion and a half of 'infantry, a squadron of horse and four guns, that Commandant Kirpikov marched against Serres from Zernovo and at dawn approached the hills which command it. His clear account of his military dispositions will be found in Appendix B (No. 23). He overcame the resistance of the Greek militia posted to the number of about 1,000 men on the hills, without much difficulty. In attempting toward noon to penetrate into the town, his troops met with a heavy fire from several large houses held by the Greeks. Against these he finally used his guns. From noon onward the town was in flames at several points. The commandant does not admit that his shells caused the conflagration, but in this matter probability is against him. One witness, George Belev, states that the schoolhouse was set on fire by a shell. The commandant states further that the Greeks themselves, who were as reckless as the Bulgarians, fired certain houses which contained their own stores of munitions. It is probable that the Bulgarians also set on fire the buildings in which their own stores were housed. Both Greeks and Bulgarians state that a high wind was blowing during the afternoon. Serres was a crowded town, closely built in the oriental fashion, with houses constructed mainly of wood. The summer had been hot and dry. It is not surprising that the town blazed. We must give due weight to the belief universally held by the Greek inhabitants that the town was deliberately set on fire by the Bulgarian troops. The inhabitants for the most part had fled, and few of them saw what happened; but one eye witness states that the soldiers used petroleum and acted on a systematic plan. This witness (quoted in Appendix B, No. 17) is a local Turk who had taken service under the Bulgarians as a police officer while they were still at war with his country. That is not a record which inspires confidence. On the other hand, Dr. Yankov, a legal official who accompanied the Bulgarian troops, states that he personally made efforts to check the flames.
The general impression conveyed by all the evidence before us, and especially that of the Russian Dr. Laznev (see Appendix D, No. 57), is that the Bulgarian troops were hotly engaged throughout the afternoon, first with the Greek militia and then with the main Greek army. The Greek forces advanced in large numbers and with artillery from two directions to relieve the town, and compelled the Bulgarians to retreat before sundown. Their shells also fell in the town. The Bulgarians were not in undisturbed possession for so much as an hour, and it is difficult to believe that they can have had leisure for much systematic incendiarism. On the other hand, it is indisputable that some Bulgarian villagers who followed the troops did deliberately burn houses (see evidence of Lazar Tomov, Appendix B, No. 25), and that a mob comprised partly of Bulgarians and partly of Turks pillaged and burned while the troops were fighting. It is probable that some of the Bulgarian troops, who seem to have been, as at Doxato, a very mixed force which included some pomak (Moslem) levies, joined in this work.
The Bulgarians knew that the Greeks were burning their villages, and some of them had heard of the schoolhouse massacre. Any soldiers in the world would think of vengeance under these conditions. In two notorious instances leading residents were blackmailed. The experiences of Mr. Zlatkos, the Greek gentleman who acts as Austro-Hungarian consul, are related in Appendix B (No. 17a). His own account must be compared with the Bulgarian version, which suggests that some of his fears were baseless. The action of the Bulgarian commander in shelling the masses of armed peasants outside the town appears to us to have been questionable. Among them there must have been many non-combatant fugitives. His use of artillery against an unfortified town was a still graver abuse of the laws of civilized warfare.
To sum up, we must conclude that the Greek quarter of Serres was burned by the Bulgarians in the course of their attack on the town, but the evidence before us does not suffice to establish the Greek accusation, that the burning was a part of the plan conceived by the Bulgarian headquarters. But unquestionably the whole conduct both of the attack and of the defense contributed to bring about the conflagration, and some of the attacking force did undoubtedly burn houses. There is, in short, no trustworthy evidence of premeditated or official incendiarism, but the responsibility for the burning of Serres none the less falls mainly upon the Bulgarian army. The result was the destruction of 4,000 out of 6,000 houses, the impoverishment of a large population, and in all likelihood the painful death of many of the aged and infirm, who could not make good their escape. The episode of Serres is deeply discreditable alike to Greeks and Bulgarians.
The events which took place at Demir-Hissar between the 5th and 10th of July possess a certain importance, because they were used as a pretext for the "reprisals" of the Greek army at the expense of the Bulgarian population. (See King Constantine's telegram. Appendix C, No. 29.) We shall have occasion to point out that the Greek excesses began in and around Kukush some days before the Bulgarian provocation at Demir-Hissar.
That Demir-Hissar was the center of excesses committed on both sides is indisputable. The facts are confused, and the evidence before us more than usually contradictory. This is not surprising in the circumstances. The Bulgarian army, beaten in the south, was fleeing in some disorder through Demir-Hissar to the narrow defile of the Struma above this little town. The Greeks of the town, seeing their confusion, determined to profit by it, took up arms and fell upon the Bulgarian wounded, the baggage trains, and the fugitive peasants. They rose too soon and exposed themselves to Bulgarian reprisals. When the Greek army at length marched in, it found a scene of carnage and horror. The Greek inhabitants had slaughtered defenseless Bulgarians, and the Bulgarian rear guard had exacted vengeance.
We print in Appendix B (Nos. 27, 27a, 28, 28a) both the Greek and the Bulgarian narratives of this affair. The Greeks as usual suppress all mention of the provocation which the inhabitants had given. The Bulgarian account is silent as to the manner in which their reprisals were carried out. Both narratives contain inaccuracies, and neither of them tells more than a part of the truth. Nor are we satisfied that the whole truth can be reached by the simple method of completing one story by means of the other. The Greek account is the more detailed and definite of the two for the simple reason that the Greeks remained in possession of the town, and were able to count and identify their dead. The Bulgarians believe that about 250 of their countrymen, wounded soldiers, military bakers, and peasant fugitives, were slaughtered there. It may be so, but the total is conjectural, and no list can possibly be furnished. The Greeks, on the other hand, have compiled a list of seventy-one inhabitants of Demir-Hissar who were killed by the Bulgarians. We do not question the accuracy of this list. But there is no means of ascertaining how many of these dead Greeks were killed during the fighting in the streets; how many were taken with arms in their hands and shot; and how many were summarily executed on suspicion of being the instigators of the rising. Two women and two babies are among the dead. If they were killed in cold blood an "atrocity" was perpetrated, but during a confused day of street fighting they may possibly have been killed by accident.
The case of the Bishop has naturally attracted attention. Of the four Greek Bishops who were said to have been killed in Macedonia, he alone was in fact killed. There is nothing improbable in the Bulgarian statement that he was the leader of the Greek insurgents, nor even in the further allegation that he fired the first shot. The Bishops of Macedonia, whether Greeks or Bulgarians, are always the recognized political heads of-their community; they are often in close touch with the rebel bands, and a young and energetic man will sometimes place himself openly at their head. The Bulgarians allege that the Bishop, a man of forty years of age, fired from his window at their troops. The Greeks admit that he "resisted" arrest. If it is true that he was found with a revolver, from which some cartridges had been fired, there was technical justification for regarding him as a combatant. The hard law of war sanctions the execution of civilians taken with arms in their hands. There is no reason to reject the Greek statement that his body was mutilated, dead or alive. But the Greek assertion that this was done by a certain Captain Bostanov is adequately met by the Bulgarian denial that any such officer exists.
Some of the men in the Greek list of dead were presumably armed inhabitants who engaged in the street fighting. Nine are young men of twenty and thereabouts and some are manual laborers. Clearly these are not "notables" collected for a deliberate massacre. On the other hand, six are men of sixty years and upwards, who are not likely to have been combatants. These leaders of the Greek community were evidently arrested on suspicion of fomenting the out-
break and summarily "executed." It was a lawless proceeding without form of trial, and the killing was evidently done in the most brutal way. We are far from feeling any certainty regarding the course of events at Demir-Hissar. There was clearly not an unprovoked massacre as the Greeks allege. But there did follow on the cowardly excesses of the Greek inhabitants against the Bulgarian wounded and fugitives, indefensible acts of reprisal, and a lawless and brutal slaughter of men who may have deserved some more regular punishment.
The events at Doxato and Demir-Hissar, with the burning of Serres, form the chief counts in the Greek indictment of the Bulgarians. The other items refer mainly to single acts of violence charged against individuals in many places over a great range of territory. These minor charges we have not investigated, since they rarely involved an accusation against the army as a whole or its superior officers. We regret that we were unable to visit Nigrita, a large village, which was burned during the fighting which raged around it. Many of the inhabitants are said to have perished in the flames. We think it proper to place on record, without any expression of opinion, the Greek belief that this place was deliberately burned by the Bulgarians. We note also the statement made by a Greek soldier in a captured letter (see Appendix C, No. 51) that more than a thousand Bulgarian prisoners were slaughtered there by the Greek army. We have also before us the signed statement of a leading Moslem of the Nigrita district to the effect that after the second war the Greeks drove the Moslems from the surrounding villages with gross violence, because they had been neutral in the conflict, and took possession of their lands and houses.
It remains to mention the charge repeatedly made by some of the diplomatic representatives of Greece in European capitals, that the fingers and ears of women were found in the pockets of captured Bulgarian soldiers. We need hardly insist on the inherent improbability of this vague story. Such relics would soon become a nauseous possession, and a soldier about to surrender would, one supposes, endeavor to throw away such damning evidence of his guilt. The only authority quoted for this accusation is a correspondent of the Times. We saw the gentleman in question at Salonica, a Greek journalist, who was acting as deputy for the Times correspondent. He had the story from Greek soldiers, and did not himself see the fingers and ears. The headquarters of the Greek army, which lost no opportunity of publishing facts likely to damage the Bulgarians, would presumably have published this accusation also, with the necessary details, had it been capable of verification. Until it is backed by further evidence, the story is unworthy of belief.
The case against the Bulgarians which remains after a critical examination of the evidence relating to Doxato, Serres, and Demir-Hissar is sufficiently grave. In each case the Bulgarians acted under provocation, and in each case the accusation is grossly exaggerated, but their reprisals were none the less lawless and unmeasured. It is fair, however, to point out that these three cases,
even on the worst view which may be taken of them, are far from supporting the general statements of some Greek writers, that the Bulgarians in their withdrawal from southern Macedonia and western Thrace, followed a general policy of devastation and massacre. They held five considerable Graeco-Turkish towns in this area and many smaller places-Drama, Kavala, Xanthi, Gumurjina, and Dedeagatch. In none of these did the Bulgarians burn and massacre, though some acts of violence occurred. The wrong they did leaves a sinister blot upon their record, but it must be viewed in its just proportions.
It required no artificial incitement to produce the race hatred which explains the excesses of the Christian Allies, and more especially of the Bulgarians toward the Turks. Race, language, history, and religion have made a barrier which only the more tolerant minds of either creed are able wholly to surmount. It is less easy to explain the excesses of which Greeks and Bulgarians were guilty toward each other. The two races are sharply distinguished by temperament. A traditional enmity has divided them from the dawn of history, and this is aggravated in Macedonia by a certain social cleavage. But for a year the two races had been allies, united against a common enemy. When policy dictated a breach, it was necessary to prepare public opinion; and the Greek press, as if by a common impulse, devoted itself to this work. To the rank and file of all three Balkan armies, the idea of a fratricidal war was at first repugnant and inexplicable.The passions of the Greek army were roused by a daily diet of violent articles.The Greek press had had little to say regarding the Bulgarian excesses against the Turks while the facts were still fresh, and indeed none of the allies had the right to be censorious, for none of their records were clean. Now everything was dragged into the light, and the record of the Bulgarian bands, deplorable in itself, lost nothing in the telling. Day after day the Bulgarians were represented as a race of monsters, and public feeling was roused to a pitch of chauvinism which made it inevitable that war, when it came, should be ruthless. In talk and in print one phrase summed up the general feeling of the Greeks toward the Bulgarians, "Dhen einai anthropoi!" (They are not human beings). In their excitement and indignation the Greeks came to think of themselves as the appointed avengers of civilization against a race which stood outside the pale of humanity.
When an excitable southern race, which has been schooled in Balkan conceptions of vengeance, begins to reason in this way, it is easy to predict the consequences. Deny that your enemies are men, and presently you will treat them as vermin. Only half realizing the full meaning of what he said, a Greek officer remarked to the writer, "When you have to deal with barbarians, you must behave like a barbarian yourself. It is the only thing they understand." The Greek army went into the war, its mind inflamed with anger and contempt. A
gaudily colored print, which we saw in the streets of Salonica and the Pireau eagerly bought by the Greek soldiers returning to their homes, reveals the dent of the brutality to which this race hatred had sunk them. It shows a Greek evzone (highlander) holding a living Bulgarian soldier with both hands, which he gnaws the face of his victim with his teeth, like some beast of prey. It is entitled the Bulgarophagos (Bulgar-eater), and is adorned with the following verses:
Another popular battle picture shows a Greek soldier gouging out the eyes of a living Bulgarian. A third shows as an episode of a battle scene the exploit of the Bulgar-eater.
As an evidence of the feeling which animated the Greek army these things have their importance. They mean, in plain words, that Greek soldiers wished to believe that they and their comrades perpetrated bestial cruelties. A print seller who issued such pictures in a western country would be held guilty of a gross libel on its army.
The excesses of the Greek army began on July 4 with the first conflict at Kukush (Kilkish). A few days later the excesses of the Bulgarians at Doxato (July 13), Serres (July 11), and Demir-Hissar (July 7) were known and still further inflamed the anger of the Greeks. On July 12 King Constantine announced in a dispatch which reported the slaughter at Demir-Hissar that he "found himself obliged with profound regret to proceed to reprisals." A comparison of dates will show that the Greek "reprisals" had begun some days before the Bulgarian "provocation."
It was with the defeat of the little Bulgarian army at Kukush (Kilkish) after a stubborn three days' defense against a superior Greek force, that the Greek campaign assumed the character of a war of devastation. The Greek army entered the town of Kukush on July 4. We do not propose to lay stress on the evidence of Bulgarian witnesses regarding certain events which preceded their entry. Shells fell outside the town among groups of fugitive peasants from the villages, while within the town shells fell in the orphanage and hospital conducted by the French Catholic sisters under the protection of the French flag. (See Appendix C, Nos. 30 and 31.) It is possible and charitable to explain such incidents as the effect of an unlucky chance. The evidence of European eye witnesses confirms the statements of the Bulgarian refugees on one crucial point. These shells caused no general conflagration, and it is doubtful whether more than three or four houses were set on fire by them. When the Greek army entered Kukush it was still intact. It is today a heap of ruins-as a member of the Commission reports, after a visit to which the Greek authorities opposed several
obstacles. It was a prosperous town of 13,000 inhabitants, the center of a purely Bulgarian district and the seat of several flourishing schools. The bent standards of its electric lamps still testify to the efforts which it had made to attain a level of material progress unusual in Turkey. That its destruction was deliberate admits of no doubt. The great majority of the inhabitants fled before the arrival of the Greeks. About four hundred, chiefly old people and children, had found shelter in the Catholic orphanage, and were not molested. European eye witnesses describe the systematic entry of the Greek soldiers into house after house. Any of the inhabitants who were found inside were first evicted, pillage followed, and then, usually after a slight explosion, the house burst into flames. Fugitives continued to arrive in the orphanage while the town was burning, and several women stated that they had been violated by Greek soldiers. In one case a soldier, more chivalrous than his comrades, brought a woman to the orphanage whom he had saved from violation. Some civilians were killed by the Greek cavalry as they rode in, and many lives were lost in the course of the sacking and burning of Kukush. We have received a detailed list from a Bulgarian source of seventy-four inhabitants who are believed to have been killed. Most of them are old women, and eleven are babies.
The main fact on which we must insist is that the Greek army inaugurated the second war by the deliberate burning of a Bulgarian town. A singular fact which has some bearing on Greek policy is that the refugees who took shelter in the French orphanage were still, on September 6, long after the conclusion of peace, closely confined as prisoners within it, though hardly a man among them is capable of bearing arms. A notice in Greek on its outer door states that they are forbidden to leave its precincts. Meanwhile, Greek (or rather "Grecoman") refugees from Strumnitsa were being installed on the sites of the houses which once belonged to Bulgarians, and in the few buildings (perhaps a dozen in number) which escaped the flames. The inference is irresistible. In conquering the Kukush district, the Greeks were resolved to have no Bulgarian subjects.
The precedent of Kukush was only too faithfully followed in the villages. In the Caza (county) of Kukush alone no less than forty Bulgarian villages were burned by the Greek army in its northward march. (See Appendix C, No. 52.) Detachments of cavalry went from village to village, and the work of the regulars was completed by bashi-basouks. It was a part of the Greek plan of campaign to use the local Turkish population as an instrument in the work of devastation. In some cases they were armed and even provided with uniforms. (See Appendix C, No. 43.) In no instance, however, of which we have a record were the Turks solely responsible for the burning of a village. They followed the Greek troops and acted under their protection. We have no means of ascertaining whether any general order was given which regulated the burning of the Bulgarian villages. A Greek sergeant among the prisoners of war in Sofia, stated in reply to a question which a member of the Commission put to him, that he and his comrades burned the villages around Kukush because the inhabitants had fled.
It is a fact that one mainly Catholic village (Todoraki) in which most of the inhabitants remained, was not burned, though it was thoroughly pillaged. (See Appendix C, No. 32.) But the fate of other villages, notably Akangeli, in which the inhabitants not only remained, but even welcomed the Greek troops, disposes of this explanation. Whatever may have been the terms of the orders under which the Greek troops acted, the effect was that the Bulgarian villages were burned with few exceptions.
Refugees have described how, on the night of the fall of Kukush, the whole sky seemed to be aflame. It was a signal which the peasants understood. Few of them hesitated, and the general flight began which ended in massing the Bulgarian population of the districts through which the Greeks marched within the former frontiers of Bulgaria. We need not insist on the hardships of the flight. Old and young, women and children, walked sometimes for two consecutive weeks by devious mountain paths. The weak fell by the wayside from hunger and exhaustion. Families were divided, and among the hundred thousand refugees scattered throughout Bulgaria, husbands are still looking for wives, and parents for children. Sometimes the stream of refugees crossed the path of the contending armies, and the clatter of cavalry behind them would produce a panic, and a sauve qui peut in which mothers lost their children, and even abandoned one in the hope of saving another. (See Appendix C, Nos. 33, 34, 35.) They arrived at the end of their flight with the knowledge that their flocks had been siezed, their crops abandoned, and their homes destroyed. In all this misery and loss there is more than the normal and inevitable wastage of war. The peasants abandoned everything and fled, because they would not trust the Greek army with their lives. It remains to inquire whether this was an unreasonable fear.
The immense majority of the Macedonian refugees in Bulgaria were never in contact with the Greek army and know nothing of it at first hand. They heard rumors of excesses in other villages; they knew that other villages had been burned; they fled because everyone was fleeing; at the worst they can say that from a distance they saw their own village in flames. It would be easy to ascribe their fears to prejudice or panic, were it not for the testimony of the few who were in direct touch with the Greek troops. In the appendices will be found a number of depositions which the Commission took from refugees. It was impossible to doubt that these peasants were telling the truth. Most of them were villagers, simple, uneducated, and stunned by their sufferings, and quite incapable of invention. They told their tales with a dull, literal directness. In two of the more striking stories, we obtained ample corroboration in circumstances which admitted of no collusion. Thus a refugee from Akangeli, who had fled to Salonica, told us there a story of butchery and outrage (see Appendix C, No. 39) which tallied in almost every detail with the story afterwards told by another fugitive from the same village who had fled to Sofia (Appendix C, No. 41). While passing through Dubnitsa we inquired from a group of refugees
whether any one present came from Akangeli. A youth stepped forward, who once more told a story which agreed with the two others (Appendix C, No. 42) The story of the boy Mito Kolev (Appendix C, No. 36) told in Sofia was similarly corroborated in an equally accidental way by two witnesses at Samakov (Appendix C, Nos. 37 and 38), who stepped out of a crowd of refugees in response to our inquiry whether anyone present came from the village in question (Gavaliantsi). We can feel no doubt about the truth of a story which reached us in this way from wholly independent eye witnesses. These two incidents are typical, and must be briefly summarized here.
Mito Kolev is an intelligent boy of fourteen, who comes from the Bulgarian village Gavaliantsi, in the Kukush district. He fled with most of his neighbors in the first alarm after the Bulgarian, defeat at Kukush, but returned next day to fetch his mother, who had remained behind. Outside the village a Greek trooper fired at him but missed him. The lad had the wit to feign death. As he lay on the ground, his mother was shot and killed by the same cavalryman. He saw another lad killed, and the same trooper then went in pursuit of a crippled girl. Of her fate Mito, who clearly distinguished between what he saw and what he suspected, knew nothing, but another witness (Lazar Tomov) chanced to see the corpse of this girl (Appendix B, No. 25). Mito's subsequent adventures were told very clearly and in great detail. The essential points are (1) that he saw his village burned, and (2) that another Greek cavalryman whom he met later in the day all but killed him with a revolver shot and a saber cut at close quarters, while he spared a by-stander who was able by his command of the language to pass himself off as a Greek. The material corroboration of this story is, that Mito still bore the marks of his wounds. A shot wound may be accidental, but a saber wound can only be given deliberately and at close quarters. A trooper who wounds a boy with his sword can not plead error. He must have been engaged in indiscriminate butchery. Of this particular squad of Greek cavalry, it is not too much to say that they were slaughtering Bulgarian peasants at sight, and that they spared neither women nor children.
The evidence regarding Akangeli (Appendix C, Nos. 39-42, and Appendix D, No. 63, paragraph b) points to the same conclusion. In this Bulgarian village near the Lake of Doiran, refugees from many of the neighboring villages, who are said to have numbered 4,000 persons, had halted in their flight. A squadron of Greek cavalry, numbering about 300 men, with officers at its head, arrived between 3 and 4 p.m. on Sunday, July 6. The villagers with their priest went out to meet them with a white flag and the Greek colors. The officer, in conversation with the mayor, accepted their surrender and ordered them to give up any arms they possessed. The peasants brought bread and cheese, and thirty sheep were requisitioned and roasted for the troops. Some sixty of the men of the place were separated from the others and sent away to a wood. Of their fate nothing is known. The villagers be-
lieve that they were slaughtered, but we have reason to hope that they may have been sent as prisoners to Salonica. While the rifles were being collected the troopers began to demand money from both men and women. The women were searched with every circumstance of indignity and indecency. One witness, a well to do inhabitant of Kukush, was bound together with a refugee whose name he did not know. He gave up his watch and five piastres and his life was spared. His companion, who had no money, was killed at his side. While the arms were being collected, one which was loaded went off accidentally and wounded an officer, who was engaged in breaking the rifles. Two youths who were standing near were then killed by the soldiers, presumably to avenge the officer's mishap. Toward evening the soldiers forced their way into the houses and began to violate the women.
Another witness, the butcher who roasted the sheep for the troops, saw two young women, whom he named, violated by three soldiers beside his oven. Infantry arrived on Monday, and shortly afterwards the village was set on fire. During Sunday night and on Monday morning many of the villagers were slaughtered. It is impossible to form an estimate of the number, for our witnesses were in hiding and each saw only a small part of what occurred. One of them estimated the number at fifty, but this was clearly only a guess. We have before us a list from a Bulgarian source of 356 persons from seven villages who have disappeared and are believed to have been killed at Akangeli. Turks from neighboring villages joined in the pillage under the eyes of the Greek soldiers and their officers. The facts which emerge clearly from our depositions are (1) that the village submitted from the first; (2) that it was sacked and burned; (3) that the Greek troops gave themselves up openly and generally to a debauch of lust; (4) that many of the peasants were killed wantonly and without provocation.
It would serve no purpose to encumber this account of the Greek march with further narratives. Many further depositions will be found in the appendices. They all convey the same impression. Wherever the peasants ventured to await the arrival of the Greek troops in their villages, they had the same experience. The village was sacked and the women were violated before it was burned, and noncombatants were wantonly butchered, sometimes in twos or threes, sometimes in larger numbers. We would call attention particularly to two of these narratives-that of Anastasia Pavlova, an elderly women of the middle class, who told her painful and dramatic story with more intelligence and feeling than most of the peasant witnesses. (Appendix C, No. 43.) Like them, she suffered violation; she was robbed, and beaten, and witnessed the dishonor of other women and the slaughter of noncombatant men. Her evidence relates in part to the taking of the town of Ghevgheli. Ghevgheli, which is a mixed town, was not burned, but a reliable European, well acquainted with the town, and known to one member of the Commission as a man of honor and ability,
Another deposition to which we would particularly call attention is that of Athanas Ivanov, who was an eye witness of the violation of six women and the murder of nine men in the village of Kirtchevo. (Appendix C, No. 44.) His story is interesting because he states that one Greek soldier who protested against the brutality of his comrades was overruled by his sergeant, and further that the order to kill the men was given by officers. It is probable that some hundreds of peasants were killed at Kirtchevo and German in a deliberate massacre, carried out with gross treachery and cruelty. (See also Appendix D, Nos. 59-62.) For these depositions the Commission assumes responsibility, in the sense that it believes that the witnesses told the truth; and, further, that it took every care to ascertain by questioning them whether any obvious excuse, such as a disorderly resistance by irregulars in the neighborhood, could be adduced. These depositions relate to the conduct of the Greek troops in ten villages. We should hesitate to generalize from this basis (save as to the fact that villages were almost everywhere burned), but we are able to add in the appendix a summary of a large number of depositions taken from refugees by Professor Miletits of Sofia University. (See Appendix D, No. 63.) While it can not assume personal responsibility for this evidence, the Commission has every confidence in the thoroughness with which Professor Miletits performed his task.
This great mass of evidence goes to show that there was nothing singular in the cases which the Commission itself investigated. In one instance a number of Europeans witnessed the brutal conduct of a detachment of Greek regulars under three officers. Fifteen wounded Bulgarian soldiers took refuge in the Catholic convent of Paliortsi, near Ghevgheli, and were nursed by the sisters. Father Alloati reported this fact to the Greek commandant, whereupon a detachment was sent to search the convent for a certain Bulgarian voyevoda (chief of bands) named Arghyr, who was not there. In the course of the search a Bulgarian Catholic priest. Father Treptche, and the Armenian doctor of the convent were severely flogged in the presence of the Greek officers. A Greek soldier attempted to violate a nun, and during the search a sum of ?T300 was stolen. Five Bulgarian women and a young girl were put to the torture, and a large number of peasants carried off to prison for no good reason. The officer in command threatened to kill Father Alloati on the spot and to burn down the convent. If such things could be done to Europeans in a building under the protection of the French flag, it is not difficult to believe that Bulgarian peasants fared incomparably worse.
The Commission regrets that the attitude of the Greek government toward its work has prevented it from obtaining any official answer to the charges which emerge from this evidence. The broad fact that the whole of this Bulgarian region, for a distance of about one hundred miles, was devastated and nearly
every village burned, admits of no denial. Nor do we think that military necessity could be pleaded with any plausibility. The Greeks were numerically greatly superior to their enemy, and so far as we are aware, their flanks were not harassed, nor their communications threatened by guerrillas, who might have found shelter in the villages. The Greeks did not wait for any provocation of this kind, but everywhere burned the villages, step by step with their advance. The slaughter of peasant men could be defended only if they had been taken in the act of resistance with arms in their hands. No such explanation will fit the cases on which we have particularly laid stress, nor have any of the war correspondents who followed the Greek army reported conflicts along the main line of the Greek march with armed villagers. The violation of women admits of no excuse; it can only be denied.
Denial unfortunately is impossible. No verdict which could be based on the evidence collected by the Commission could be more severe than that which Greek-soldiers have pronounced upon themselves. It happened that on the eve of the armistice (July 27) the Bulgarians captured the baggage of the Nineteenth Greek infantry regiment at Dobrinichte (Razlog). It included its post-bags, together with the file of its telegraphic orders, and some of its accounts. We were permitted to examine these documents at our leisure in the Foreign Office at- Sofia. The file of telegrams and accounts presented no feature of interest. The soldiers' letters were written often in pencil on scraps of paper of every sort and size. Some were neatly folded without envelopes. Some were written on souvenir paper commemorating the war, and others on official sheets. Most of them bore the regimental postal stamp. Four or five were on stamped business paper belonging to a Turkish firm in Serres, which some Greek soldier had presumably taken while looting the shop. The greater number of the letters were of no public interest, and simply informed the family at home that the writer was well, and that his friends were well or ill or wounded as the case might be. Many of these letters still await examination. We studied with particular care a series of twenty-five letters, which contained definite avowals by these Greek soldiers of the brutalities which they had practiced. Two members of the Commission have some knowledge of modern Greek. We satisfied ourselves (1) that the letters (mostly illiterate and ill written'> had been carefully deciphered and honestly translated; (2) that the interesting portions of the letters were in the same handwriting as the addresses on the envelopes (which bore the official stamp) and the portions which related only personal news; (3) that no tampering with the manuscripts had been practiced. Some minor errors and inaccuracies are interesting, as an evidence of authenticity. Another letter is dated by error July 15 (old style), though the post-bags were captured on the 14th (27th). We noted, moreover, that more than one slip (including an error of grammar) had been made by the Bulgarian secretary in transcribing the addresses of the letters from Greek into Latin script -a proof that he did not know enough
Greek to invent them. But it is unnecessary to dwell on these minor evidences of authenticity. The letters have been published in fac simile. The addresses and the signatures are those of real people. If they had been wronged by some incredibly ingenious forger, the Greek government would long ago have brought these soldiers before some impartial tribunal to prove by specimens of their genuine handwriting that they did not write these letters. The Commission, in short is satisfied that the letters are genuine.
The letters require no commentary. Some of the writers boast of the cruelties practiced by the Greek army. Others deplore them. The statements of fact (see Appendix C, No. 51) are simple, brutal, and direct, and always to the same effect. These soldiers all state that they everywhere burned the Bulgarian villages. Two boast of the massacre of prisoners of war. One remarks that all the girls they met with were violated. Most of the letters dwell on the slaughter of noncombatants, including women and children. These few extracts, each from a separate letter, may suffice to convey their general tenor:
By order of the King we are setting fire to all the Bulgarian villages, because the Bulgarians burned the beautiful town of Serres, Nigrita, and several Greek villages. We have shown ourselves far more cruel than the Bulgarians. * * *
We have to burn the villages-such is the order-slaughter the young people and spare only the old people and the children. * * *
What is done to the Bulgarians is indescribable; also to the Bulgarian peasants. It was a butchery. There is not a Bulgarian town or village but is burned.
Of the 1,200 prisoners we took at Nigrita, only forty-one remain in the prisons, and everywhere we have been we have not left a single root of this race.
The Greek army sets fire to all the villages where there are Bulgarians and massacres all it meets. * * * God knows where this will end.
These letters relieve us of the task of summing up the evidence. From Kukush to the Bulgarian frontier the Greek army devastated the villages, violated the women, and slaughtered the noncombatant men. The order to carry out reprisals was evidently obeyed. We repeat, however, that these reprisals began before the Bulgarian provocation. A list of Bulgarian villages burned by the Greek army which will be found in Appendix C (No. 52) conveys some measure of this ruthless devastation. At Serres the Bulgarians destroyed 4,000
houses in the conflagration which followed the fighting in the streets. The ruin of this considerable town has impressed the imagination of the civilized world. Systematically and in cold blood the Greeks burned one hundred and sixty Bulgarian villages and destroyed at least 16,000 Bulgarian homes. The figures need no commentary.
No account of the sufferings of the noncombatant population in Macedonia would be complete which failed to describe the final exodus of Moslems and Greeks from the territory assigned to Bulgaria. Vast numbers of Moslems arrived on the outskirts of Salonica during our stay there. We saw them camped to the number, it is said, of 8,000, in the fields and by the roadside. They had come with their bullock carts, and whole families found their only shelter in these primitive vehicles. They had left their villages and their fields, and to all of them the future was a blank. They did not wish to go to Asia, nor did they wish to settle, they knew not how nor where, in Greek territory. They regretted their homes, and spoke with a certain passive fatalism of the events which had made them wanderers. They were, when we visited them, without rations, but we heard that the Greek authorities afterwards made some effort to supply them with bread.
The history of this exodus is somewhat complicated. It was part of the Greek case to assert that no minority, whether Greek or Moslem, can safely live under Bulgarian rule. The fact is, that of all the Balkan countries, Bulgaria alone has retained a large proportion of the original Moslem inhabitants. Official Greek statements predicted, before peace was concluded, that the Moslem and Greek minorities would emigrate from the new Bulgarian territories in a body. The popular press went further, and announced that with their own hands they would bum down their own houses. When the time arrived, steps were taken to realize these prophecies, more particularly at Strumnitsa and in the neighboring villages.
We questioned several groups of these Moslem peasants on the roadside near Salonica. (Appendix A, No. 4.) We took the deposition of a leading Turkish notable of Strumnitsa, Hadji Suleiman Effendi.(See Appendix A, No. 3.) We questioned the Greek refugees from the same town who were at Kukush.We obtained Bulgarian evidence at Sofia. (See Appendix D, No. 65.) Finally, we have before us the confidential evidence of an authoritative witness, a subject of a neutral power, who visited the town before the exodus was complete. From all these sources we heard the same story. The Greek military authorities in Strumnitsa gave the explicit order that all the Moslem and Greek inhabitants of the town and villages must abandon their homes and emigrate to Greek territory. The order was backed by the warning that their houses would be burned. Persuasion was used and was,
in the case of the Greeks, partially successful. They were told that the Bulgarians would massacre them if they remained. They were also assured that a new Strumnitsa would be built for them at Kukush on a splendid scale and they were promised houses and lands. Some of the leaders of the Greek community eagerly embraced this policy and used their influence to enforce it. The Greek exodus was far from being spontaneous, but it was on the whole voluntary. Our conviction is that the Moslems yielded to force. It is true that they had had a terrible experience under the mixed Serbo-Bulgarian rule in the early weeks of the first war. But this they had survived, and most of them stated that Bulgarian rule, after this first excess, had been at least tolerable. Most of them departed in obedience to the order. Some vainly attempted to bribe the Greek soldiers. A few obstinately remained and were evicted by force. The same procedure was followed in the villages.
The emigration began about August 10. On the evening of Wednesday, August 21, parties of Greek soldiers began to burn the empty houses of the Moslem and Greek quarters on a systematic plan, and continued their work on the following nights up to August 23. The Greeks evacuated what was left of the town on August 27, and handed it over to the Bulgarian troops. The Bulgarian quarter was not burned, since the object of the Greeks was to circulate the legend that the non-Bulgarian inhabitants had themselves burned their own houses. To estimate the full significance of this extraordinary outrage, it must be remembered that it was perpetrated in time of peace, after the signature of the Peace of Bucharest.
A similar emigration of the Greek inhabitants of Melnik also took place under pressure. Their houses, however, were not burned, and there are indications that some of them will endeavor to return when the pressure is relaxed.
We found some hundreds of the Greek fugitives from Strumnitsa. at Kukush. They are not, in point of fact, Greeks at all, but Slavs, bi-lingual for the most part, who belong to the Greek party and the Patriarchist Church. One woman had a husband still serving in the Bulgarian army; she at least was not a voluntary fugitive from Bulgarian rule. These people were camped amid the ruins of Kukush, some in the few houses which escaped the conflagration, and others in improvised shelters. They received rations, and hoped to see the "New Strumnitsa" arise on the ashes of what was once a Bulgarian town. From the windows of the Catholic orphanage the remnant of the genuine population of Kukush, closely imprisoned, watched the newcomers establishing themselves on sites which were once their own. The Greek authorities are apparently determined to dispose of the lands of the fugitive Bulgarian villagers as though conquest had wiped out all private rights of property. The fugitives from Strumnitsa are simple people. One man spoke rather naively of his first horror at the idea of leaving his native place. Later, he said, he had acquiesced; he supposed the authorities knew best. Another fugitive, a village priest, regretted
his home, which had, he said, the best water in all Macedonia. But he was sure that flight was wise. He had reason to fear the Bulgarians. A comitadji, early in the first war, pointed a rifle at his breast, and said: "Become a Bulgarian, or I'll kill you." He forthwith became a Bulgarian for several months and conformed to the exarchist church. These "Greeks" will probably be well cared for, and may have a prosperous future. The Moslem fugitives furnish the tragic element of this enforced exodus. It creates three problems: What will become of these uprooted Turkish families? Who will acquire the lands they have left behind? By what right can the Greeks dispose of the Bulgarian lands in the Kukush region? The problem may solve itself by some rough exchange, but not without endless private misery and immense injustice.
In bringing this painful chapter to a conclusion, we desire to remind the reader that it presents only a partial and abstract picture of the war. It brings together in a continuous perspective the sufferings of the noncombatant populations of Macedonia and Thrace at the hands of armies flushed with victory or embittered by defeat. To base upon it any moral judgment would be to show an uncritical and unhistorical spirit. An estimate of the moral qualities of the Balkan peoples under the strain of war must also take account of their courage, endurance, and devotion. If a heightened national sentiment helps to explain these excesses, it also inspired the bravery that won victory and the steadiness that sustained defeat. The moralist who seeks to understand the brutality to which these pages bear witness, must reflect that all the Balkan races have grown up amid Turkish models of warfare. Folk-songs, history and oral tradition in the Balkans uniformly speak of war as a process which includes rape and pillage, devastation and massacre. In Macedonia all this was not a distant memory but a recent experience. The new and modern feature of these wars was that for the first time in Balkan annals an effort, however imperfect, was made by some of the combatants and by some of the civil officials, to respect an European ideal of humanity. The only moral which we should care to draw from these events is that war under exceptional conditions produced something worse than its normal results. The extreme barbarity of some episodes was a local circumstance which has its root in Balkan history. But the main fact is that war suspended the restraints of civil life, inflamed the passions that slumber in time of peace, destroyed the natural kindliness between neighbors, and set in, its place the will to injure. That is everywhere the essence of war.
The Commission was afforded a perfectly natural opportunity of investigating the atrocities attributed to the Bulgarians after they had taken Adrianople. On August 20, 1913, the Dally Telegraph published a very solid body of material sent to the paper by Mr. Ashmead Bartlett, and printed under the suggestive heading "Terrible Reports by a Russian Official." On August 26 and 27, this same report appeared in Constantinople in the official organ of the Committee of Union and Progress, Le Jeune Turc. Since, however, the latter contained details omitted by the Daily Telegraph, the information published in Le Jeune Turc was evidently first hand. On August 28 Le Jeune Turc revealed the source of its information as the result of an unofficial Russian contradiction inserted in La Turquie of August 27. "We are authorized," declared the unofficial organ of the Russian Embassy at Constantinople, "to give a categorical denial of the information of the Daily Telegraph reproduced in Le Jeune Turc and attributed to a Russian official. No Russian official has been commissioned to make inquiries in Thrace and at Adrianople, or to obtain any kind of information : none is therefore in a position to supply such a report. Nor have the Russian consuls recorded the facts mentioned in the Telegraph." Replying to this denial, which certainly emanated from the Russian Embassy, Le Jeune Turc stated that "the document in question was not the work of a Russian official in active service, but of an ex-official, the Consul-General Machkov, who was in fact the correspondent of the Noroie Vremya." It should be added that Mr. Machkov's telegraphic "report" was rejected by his paper, and that, according to the statement of Mr. Machkov's colleagues of the Constantinople press, the expense of his telegram amounting to ?T150, was repaid him by the Committee. Le Jeune Turc itself said: "Fearing, no doubt, lest the paper (the Novoie Vremya) being excessively Bulgarophil [This is not at all the case.] might not publish the results of his eight days' inquiry in Adrianople, Mr. Machkov sent copies of it to the President of the Council of Ministers and the Foreign Minister."
The veracity of the document, which made a profound impression in Europe, is naturally in no way prejudiced by its origin and history, which do however assist an understanding of the spirit in which it is conceived. One of the members of the Balkan Commission came to Adrianople to follow up Mr. Machkov's information. He succeeded in getting in touch with the sources from
which it was largely derived, and had repeated to him verbally practically the whole of the facts and sayings contained in Mr. Machkov's account. The truth seems to be that while Mr. Machkov invented nothing and added practically nothing to the information he was able to collect in Adrianople, he did rely upon distinctly partisan sources, in so far as the medium through which his information came was Greek. The member of the Commission was at pains not to confine his inquiry to this medium. In addition to obtaining from the persons responsible for the administration of the city in occupation, a long series of official Bulgarian depositions (see Appendix G, 3), he succeeded in pushing his inquiries in Adrianople itself, in other than purely Greek areas, and in utilizing the depositions of Turkish prisoners at Sofia, collected by another member of the Commission (see Appendix G, 2). Thus without any intention of rehabilitating the Bulgarians, he succeeded in establishing the facts in a more impartial manner than could be done by Mr. Machkov, who had been known as a very pronounced Bulgarphobe since his tenure of the Russian consulate at Uskub, fifteen years previously.
The account of affairs in Adrianople falls into three sections: first, the capture of the town and the days immediately following,—March 26-30, 1913; secondly, the Bulgarian administration of the town during the occupation, and thirdly, the last days and the evacuation,—July 19-22, 1913.
The particular charge made against the Bulgarians during this short period is that they were guilty of acts of cruelty against the Turkish prisoners and of pillaging the inhabitants of the town. Any clear establishment of their responsibility depends on a knowledge of the situation existing prior to the occupation. To throw light on this point we will refer to a document entitled Journal of the Siege of Adrianople, published in Adrianople itself over the initials "P. C.," belonging to a person well known in the locality and worthy of every confidence. So early as January 31 (new style), P. C. remarks that "the famine has become more atrocious: there is nothing to be heard in some of the poor quarters of the town but the cries of the little children asking for bread and the wailing of the mothers who have none to give them. From the Hildyrym quarter it is reported that a man has committed suicide after killing his wife and three children. A Turkish woman, a widow, is said to have cast her little ones into the Toundja. * * *" And so on. On February 12, P. C. speaks of the "famished soldiers," forbidden to receive alms, and who "beg you to cast your money on the ground, whence they may pick it up an instant after." On March 2, revolt broke out among the Hildyrym populace and the writer forecasts what was to follow in these words: "A day of vengeance and reprisals will come when the besiegers enter." The soldiery stole bread in broad daylight and refused to give it up when taken in the act. P. C. describes, two days
after, how "groups of people pass you who can hardly hold each other up; most of their faces are emaciated, their skin looks earthy and corpse-like; others with swollen limbs and puffy countenances seem hardly able to stumble along. You see them chewing at lumps of snow to cheat their hunger." And nearly two weeks were still to pass before the surrender! On March 12 the following scene took place: "A soldier crossing the Maritza bridge suddenly stopped, beat the air two or three times with his hands and fell down dead." He was thought to be wounded but "it was only starvation." "Stretchers bearing dead or diseased persons pass in constant succession; the doctors predict an appalling mortality as soon as the mild weather comes." On March 19, "In the hospitals one death follows another; yesterday two new cases of cholera were reported." * * * "This morning a poor trooper was brought in, poisoned from browsing on grass. Since the spring the cases have been multiplied." On March 22, "We have had five deaths last night; at the moment the mortality is from 50 to 60 a day, the result not of any epidemic, but of pneumonia affections and physiological starvation. Many have eaten unwholesome or poisonous bodies." Finally, there is the extract referring to the "last day of Adrianople," i. e., Wednesday, March 26, the day on which the town fell. It runs as follows:
The streets and squares are gradually filling with emaciated and ragged soldiers, who march gloomily to the rendezvous or sit down with an air of resignation at the corners and along the walls. There is no disorder among them: on the contrary they present a picture of utter prostration and sadness. * * *In contrast to the calm dignity of the Turks, the Greek mob showed an ever increasing meanness. They did not yet dare to insult their disarmed masters, but began to pillage like madmen, to an accompaniment of yells, blows and blasphemies. The Turks let them carry off everything without saying a word. [These somewhat long quotations from P. C.'s book have been made because it is now a bibliographical rarity. P. C.'s impressions are confirmed by another Journal of the Siege of Adrianople, by Gustave Cirilli (Paris: Chapelot, 1913), see pp. 129-151, etc.]
It only remains now to place the picture thus given in juxtaposition with Mr. Machkov's report and the commentary by the Bulgarian authorities on the events at the moment of the entry of their troops, to see how the different accounts complete and confirm one another.
Take, to begin with, the truly awful fate of the prisoners incarcerated in the island of Toundja, Sarai Eski. A member of the Commission visited the island. He saw how the bark had been torn off the trees, as high as a man could reach, by the starving prisoners. He even met on the spot an aged Turk who had spent a week there, and said he had himself eaten the bark. A little Turkish boy who looked after the cattle on the island, said that from across the river he had seen the prisoners eating the grass and made a gesture to show the inquirer how they did it. General Vasov stated in his deposition (see Ap-
pendix G, 3) that he gave the prisoners permission to strip the bark off the trees for fuel, a fact confirmed by other trustworthy witnesses. The same general, from the second day on, ordered a quarter loaf to be distributed to the prisoners, which he took from the rations of the Bulgarian soldiery. This was confirmed by Major Mitov, who was entrusted with carrying out the order, which is moreover inscribed in the War Minister's archives (see Appendix G, 5). On the first day the victorious soldiery shared their bread with the prisoners and the starving populace. But touching incidents like this could not, any more than the general's order, supply the mass of the people with the food for lack of which they perished, and there are good grounds for believing that these poor wretches went on consuming the "unwholesome or poisonous" stuffs of which P. C. speaks.The mortality among the prisoners must have been severe, especially in the island, where cholera broke out again on the third or fourth day of the siege. There is evidence of a want of tents, which was indeed true of the whole army. The further fact that these unfortunate creatures passed the night exposed to all the rigors of rain and freezing mud, would in itself explain the increasing mortality. It is hardly possible to believe, after reading the descriptions published in the European press, for example Barzini's article in the Corriere delle Sera, that the isolation of the sick really had the good effects alleged by General Vasov.
The number of deaths has been variously estimated. Major Mitov speaks of thirty after the first morning. Major Choukri-bey, a captive officer, puts the number in a single day at a hundred; General Vasov estimated the total number of deaths at 100 or 200. The real figures must be higher. The Turk interrogated by the member of the Commission told him that the group in which he was consisted of some 1,800 persons confined in a narrow space indicated by
a gesture. On the night of March 15, 187 of them, he said, died of cold and hunger. The witnesses, it may be noted, put disease second or third among the causes of death. The main cause was still, as during the siege, weakness and exhaustion resulting from starvation, the agonizing effects of which lasted not only during the five days of the final struggle of which Mr. Vasov speaks, but for months. It must certainly not be forgotten that the explosion of the bridge over the Arda, and the destruction of the Turkish depots, made it difficult to provide food for 55,000 prisoners and inhabitants. But when all these admissions have been made, there remains as a fact not to be denied, the cruel indifference in general to the lot of the prisoners. This fact is fully confirmed by the depositions of the captive Turkish officers at Sofia. One is therefore bound to admit that the conduct of the victors towards their captive foes left much to be desired. Some of the rigorous measures reported by Turkish officers might be given as a reason against the attempts to escape made by certain prisoners. But that can not explain everything: what about the vanquished who were bayoneted at night and their corpses left exposed in the streets till noon? The case reported by Mr. Machkov, of the Turkish captive officer who, being too weak to march, was slain by the Bulgarian soldiers in charge, as well as a Jew who had tried to defend him, is fully confirmed by a reserve officer, Hadji Ali, himself a prisoner at Sofia. Mr. Machkov gives the name of the compassionate Jew, Salomon Behmi; and at Constantinople the very words uttered, in Turkish, by this Jew, "Yazyk, wourma" ("It is a sin: do not kill,") were reported to the member of the Commission. Hadji Ali knew the name of the slain Turk, Captain Ismail-Youzbachi, and saw him fall with his own eyes. The explanation given by General Vasov and the Baroness Yxcoull proves that the death of the thirteen Turks slain in the mosque at Miri-Miran can not be laid at the Bulgarians' door; but the depositions of the Turkish soldiers concerning the murder of the sick and diseased prisoners on the Mustapha Pasha route are more than probably true. We shall return to this question of the treatment of prisoners in the chapter dealing with international law.
A Greek version of the pillage of Adrianople reproduced by Mr. Machkov is unkind to a degree calculated to prejudice public opinion. Apart from Mr. Machkov and Mr. Pierre Loti, who merely repeats the Turkish version prevailing at the moment without verifying it, almost all the authorities agree in recognizing- that the pillaging during the days that followed the fall of the town was due to the Greeks themselves—to some extent also to the Jews, and Armenians; but mainly to the Greeks,—who simply fell upon the undefended property of the Turks. The quotations made above from P. C.'s journal foreshadow this truth, which is fully corroborated and removed from the region of doubt by the body of evidence collected by the Commission.
Pillage had begun in Adrianople before the Bulgarian troops entered the town, and continued until the occupation and the installation of the army was an
accomplished fact. Innumerable scenes have been described by eye witnesses. A considerable number,—which could be indefinitely increased,—will be found in the Appendix.
Even during the entry by the Bulgarian soldiers the streets were occupied by the indigenous mob, which pillaged all the Turkish public buildings, beginning with the military clubs, and attacked private houses, beginning with the vacant abodes of the Turkish officers. Patrols were hastily sent out, who lost themselves in the labyrinth of streets, and the people were instructed to whistle for their aid. However, the mass of the Turks feared reprisals on the part of the Greeks. The patrols wandered hither and thither punishing a few malefactors to the cries of "Aferim" (Bravo!) from the Turks. But the Turks themselves told Mr. Mitov, who described the scenes to us, "you can not be everywhere at once." And so the pillaging went on.
An official (whose name we are not permitted to disclose) went through the streets on the second day of the occupation. Djouma-bey, the Secretary of the Vali, pointed out crowds of men and women on every side, carrying off the goods they had stolen. Going into the Hotel de Ville, he asked for a patrol and went out with Major Mitov. Everywhere the same sight met their eyes. A perpetual stream of women, making off with their plunder. He threatened them with his stick. Mr. Mitov pointed his revolver. The women made off, dropping their bundles; then, as the authorities passed on they saw the same women coming back and picking up their booty. They arrived at the mosque, where the populace had stored its household goods. Standing at the door the Bulgarian officer ordered the pillage to stop and the pillagers to go out one by one. As they passed out they were hit with the stick and the butt end of the revolver. The women, however, would not let go; in spite of the bastinado to which they were treated they stuck to their thefts. There were too many of them, both men and women, to be taken up and punished, and they took advantage of this accident of superior strength.
By the third day the patrols were regularly established; order began to be restored. Nevertheless pillage and robbery went on, though under new forms suited to the new conditions. Sometimes the thieves dressed themselves up as soldiers and having obtained entrance to a house in the guise of a patrol, plundered at their ease. It was at this point that the Bulgarian soldiers in their turn began to follow suit, or rather to cooperate with the rest in a new kind of division of labor. There is evidence to show that the patrols worked to protect— the thieves, on condition that they might share in their booty. Major Mitov himself admitted that the soldiers had, to his knowledge, often been induced by their Greek hosts to take part in pillage, every possible means of persuasion being tried as inducement.
Here again the authorities have simply had to admit their powerlessness. The member of the Commission responsible for the inquiry was told that a
captive soldier "pomak" (i. e., a Bulgarian Mussulman), well known in one of the consulates, was given a written permit to go about as a "free prisoner"; but on attempting to make use of his permit, he was robbed in the streets by the regulars, who stripped him of everything down to his boots. He returned to the consulate barefoot and a complaint was sent in to Commander Grantcharov. All he could do however was to renew the poor devil's permit and give him a medjide (4 1/2 francs) out of his own pocket, to buy shoes.
Pillage even went on at the Bulgarian consulate in Adrianople. The consul, Mr. Kojoukharov, on returning thither from Kirk Kilisse, whence he had been transferred, found his trunks had been emptied. Mr. Chopov, chief of police in Adrianople, told us that he was unwilling to make inquiry into Mr. Kojoukharov’s case, because he was a Bulgarian. On the other hand, Mr. Vasov told us that he refused to make domiciliary investigations, "to avoid disturbing the people," and perhaps also to avoid creating new opportunities for pillage. Such investigations were made, however,—and Mr. Vasov mentioned them himself,—in search of soldiers in hiding and disguise.
Moreover, complaints and requests for inquiries poured in from the pillaged people, especially from the Turks, to the number of two or three hundred a day, according to Mr. Mitov. Thereupon domiciliary investigations were instituted, with excellent results in many cases. A quantity of goods stolen from the Turks were discovered in the houses of the Greeks and handed back to their owners. The chief of police opened a depot in the Hotel de Ville for goods of doubtful origin and unknown ownership; and Mr. Chopov told the Commission that the stolen goods were brought in by the cart load. Certificates were then issued bythe municipality stating that ownership of the goods had been acquired not by theft but by purchase. Mr. Mitov explained to the Commission that this became an ingenious and novel method of claiming ownership of certain goods which had in fact been bought, but at a very low price, by Jews and Greeks.
Domiciliary investigations of course furnished their own crop of abuses. Here again, however, Greek complaints can not always be taken as expressing the truth, and nothing but the truth, as is suggested by one case cited by Mr. Machkov. In his report he says: "Soldiers, armed with muskets, carried off a quantity of jewelry and precious antiques from two Greeks, the brothers Alexandre and Jean Thalassinos; they wrenched rings and bracelets from the hands of their sister."
A great deal has been said about the pillage of the carpets and library of the celebrated mosque of Sultan Selim. The evidence collected by the Commission enables us to settle this point. That the Bulgarian authorities, as soon as circumstances permitted, took every reasonable precaution for safeguarding the mosque is clear. It is however not true, nor did the interested parties ever try to spread the belief, that the mosque was not pillaged at all. In the first confusion the fine building served as a place of refuge and was filled by the
wretched furniture of the poor Mussulman families who sought an asylum there. Mr. Mitov told us how these Mussulmen took their domestic utensils and their rags with them when they left. Mr. Chopov added that the carpets of the mosque were not injured and the representative of the military governor of Adrianople who was attached to the member of the Commission responsible for the inquiry certainly made no complaints on the score of this alleged vandalism.
The case of the library is different. During an entire day it was at the mercy of the populace, thanks to the existence of a private entry overlooked by Mr. Mitov at his first visit. On returning to the mosque in the course of the next day he perceived clear traces of pillage. Books were lying on the floor; some had been torn from their bindings; everything believed to have been of value had evidently been removed. In Adrianople and in Sofia it is said that foreign orientalists, enlightened connoisseurs, were happily inspired to save precious manuscripts and rare volumes by buying them at their own expense. If the happy possessors, now that all danger of destruction is over, restore its property to the mosque, this action will have been admirable. The evidence of Baroness Yxcoull shows that order was restored in the mosque, as in the town of Adrianople, from the third day of the occupation.
Let us now, leaving on one side other characteristic incidents, which could be multiplied ad infinitum, consider the general criticism passed on the Bulgarian administration, during the four months of the occupation,—March 13/26 to July 9/22. That the general impression on the part of the inhabitants of Adrianople today is decidedly unfavorable to the subjects of King Ferdinand is undeniable. Those representing Bulgarian authority have thus ample opportunity of estimating at their true value the official expressions of gratitude which were extended to them on behalf of the heterogeneous population of the town. The Turks are only too glad to pass once more under the sway of their national government. Both interest and patriotism have always made the Greeks hostile to the Bulgarians.
The testimony of foreigners is mixed. Mr. Klimenko, head of the Russian consulate during the siege, authorizes us to state in his name that up to his departure from Adrianople on April 7, he had no complaint to make of the Bulgarian regime. The judgment of the brothers of the Assumption, and to some extent of the Armenians, is equally favorable. The documents annexed to this volume contain a list, supplied by the authorities themselves, of the measures taken by the Bulgarian authorities to restore order and satisfy the various nationalities concerned. On the other hand, Mr. Gustave Cirilli, in his Diary of the Siege, speaks of the Bulgarian administration as creating "an irresistible tide of distrust or aversion"; due, according to him, "not so much to vexatious exactions which alienated the sympathies of the inhabitants," as to the extravagant nationalism of the Bulgarians, their efforts to impose their religious observances and language. At the same time Mr. Cirilli does justice to the administration of the last commander, Mr. Veltchev, of whom Mr. Machkov speaks so ill, describing his system as "the hand of iron in the velvet glove."
The Commission's competence was, of course, limited to a record of the externals of the regime. It is well known that the municipality retained its powers under the Bulgarian domination and that a majority on the council belonged to the nationalities (three Bulgarians, three Greeks, three Turks, two Jews, one Armenian). The Turks were better disposed than the other nationalities to a Bulgarian administration which saved them from pillage, and frequently passed official votes of approval upon it. The Greeks, on the other hand, did not conceal their hostility. Amusing stories are told of meetings between Mr. Polycarpe, the Greek Metropolitan, and representatives of the Bulgarian power, the former being visibly torn between deference due to constituted authority and inward revolt. The most exaggerated statements about the misconduct of the Bulgarians emanate from Greek sources. The measures taken by General Veltchev are the natural result of the temper of bold bravado which again took possession of the conquered or hostile peoples at the close of the occupation period. Mr. Bogoyev indeed told us (see Appendix G, 5)
that Mr. Veltchev called the Turkish and Greek notables together and stated that he should hold the Greek Metropolitan specifically responsible in the event of any rebellion of the "Young" Greeks. The events described above on the Aegean coasts justified only too fully the Bulgarians' suspicions of the Bishop of Adrianople as the center of the patriotic Hellenic agitation directed to the recovery of Thracian autonomy.
In the irritation produced by national conflict, reinforced by the "vexatious exactions" to which the natives were subjected, lies the explanation of their verdict on the Bulgarian regime in Adrianople. Wholesale and retail merchants were thoroughly displeased with the new organization of the wagons employed for importing goods as well as with the maximum prices of commodities fixed by the Bulgarian authorities. The highly interesting explanations of Mr. Lambrev, apropos of Greek accusations on this head, will be found in the Appendix. They describe a most interesting social experiment whose aim was to harmonize middlemen's profits with the legitimate needs of the population.
Complaints also came from the owners of houses occupied by Bulgarian officers. Comparisons between Bulgarian and Servian officers are generally disadvantageous to the former. Even friends of the Bulgars admit that, as far as externals go, the Servians had "a more distinguished appearance" and that their bearing made a favorable impression, in contrast to Bulgarian "arrogance." Obviously, therefore, the Servian officer was, generally speaking, preferred as an inmate to his colleague. All the same it is also probable that, in the troublous days, many people were glad enough to have a Bulgarian officer in the house to keep off the blows of the mob and the dubious protection of the patrols. To this the Greek notables apparently afforded an exception, however; in certain cases they met the demands of the billeting committee with a blank refusal ; [The members of the Committee were Fouad-bey, the Mayor (a Greek doctor named Courtidis), an Armenian and a Jew.]and it was sometimes necessary to use compulsion against them. For example, no suitable lodging being forthcoming for General Kessaptchiev, he was obliged, on his return from Salonica, to put up at the Hotel du Commerce.
It can hardly be denied that there were cases when departing officers,—and not only Bulgarian officers,—did take with them certain "souvenirs" of the houses in which they had dwelt. It is, however, a gross exaggeration to speak of "train loads of pseudo war booty" being sent to Sofia. Mr. Chopov himself has explained the "Chopov case" (see Appendix G, 6) and his explanation could be confirmed, if needful, by the evidence from Turkish merchants. There has been a certain amount of talk about the story of Rodrigues, an Austrian subject, and it is said that the Bulgarian authorities have promised the Inquiry Commission to assign responsibility, and refund the loss. Laces, ribbons and even ladies' dancing slippers are said to have been carried off from a house in Adrianople, the residence of Nissim-Ben-Sousam.
A Sofia paper, the Dnevnik, reported the naive admissions of Mr. Nikov, a Bulgarian officer and another devotee of oriental knick-knacks. In the early days of the occupation, he saw an old Greek woman carrying a seat of exquisite workmanship, adorned with carvings in oriental taste. All the trouble and privation he had had to undergo in the long months of the siege, in the muddy trenches, came to his mind and strengthened his conviction that he had a right to the precious piece of furniture. So, instead of conveying it to the depot opened by Mr. Chopov, he took it from the old woman, whose right to it was the same as his own. These officers came and gave evidence before the Commission or made public confession. There must, however, be others who refrained from appearing or saying anything. The carpets of the mosque of Sultan Selim were not touched and Mr. Chopov bought his fairly and squarely. But a member of the Commission was told that there was a time when the price of carpets fell markedly low, and admirable "windfalls" were secured in Sofia.
Again, sums of money are said to have been extorted for the liberation of captured individuals. Mr. Chopov, for instance, speaks of the case of the Vali Habil, whose freedom is said to have been obtained by these means. The Greeks in Adrianople say that he paid the huge ransom of ?T40,000. Such a scandalous transaction, had it really taken place, could not have passed unnoted; the story must be added to the legends circulated by the Greeks. At the same time the Commission would not venture to affirm that there were no abuses of this character, on a more modest scale. Tales are told in Adrianople of one Hadji-Selim, tobacco merchant and leader of a band, who was finally executed but whom, previous to his execution, they tried to compel to sign a cheque for ?T1,000 to his credit as a deposit in the National Bank of Bulgaria. Hadji-Selim is said to have signed but to have repudiated his signature in prison on the eve of execution, in the presence of the public prosecutor, the director of the Ottoman Bank who had had the cheque presented to him, his assistant and some officers.
These incidents, of interest to the moralist in the tangle they present of human weakness and honest effort, conscientious performance of duty and the crimes that follow in the conqueror's train, may be left to the judgment of the reader: a judgment that must allow for the exceptional circumstances of a great city in a state of siege. There could be no question, at this stage, of the normal administration established later on when the Turks returned as a "tertius gau-dens," when war broke out again after the disagreement between the allies and the violation of the first conventions. We have only now to report the events of the last period of Bulgarian occupation.
On July 6/19, the administrative officials in Adrianople received orders to return to Bulgaria. The telegram arrived at 11.30 at night; the public knew
nothing of it. At midnight the Rechadie Gardens were still full of people, the inevitable cinematograph films passing before the idlers' eyes. The departure of the Bulgarians was sudden. That is why they left their cannon, their store of ammunition and their supplies behind them; why also the accusations of pillage and outrage made against them fall away, since the very conditions of their departure made them impossible. In their haste they even forgot to remove the sentinels stationed at the doors of some protected houses. Bulgarian merchants complained bitterly of the secrecy with which the move was carried out by the authorities. It did indeed take everybody by surprise.
The authorities left Adrianople on the night of July 6-7 (19-20). The Turks however did not arrive. In the city itself Major Morfov, with his seventy gendarmes, and Commandant Manov, represented law and order, but there were no regular authorities at the station or in the Karagatch quarter, and here deplorable incidents took place. On July 7, some eight military trains left the Karagatch station; by the time the last train but one departed the marauders were already at work and had to be fired at from the carriage roofs. A fire broke out in the depots, started, say the Greek witnesses, by a detachment of Bulgarian infantry on its way from the south towards Mustapha Pasha. Some of these same soldiers told the brothers of the Assumption that the depots had been fired by peasants, the Bulgarian army being beyond the station and the depots at that time. According to their statement the soldiers only set fire to the barracks, which was also used as an arsenal. Anyhow, there is no doubt that pillaging began under the eyes of the Bulgarians as they got on board the trains ; that the pillagers were peasants from Karagatch and the adjoining districts, Tcheurek-Keui and Dolou-djaros; that the soldiers tried to fire on them but the departure of the trains left them free to continue their pillaging. The peasants then armed the Turkish prisoners working on the railway—the same, evidently, of whom Mr. Bogoyev speaks. During the evening of July 7/20, the inhabitants of Karagatch laid in stores of petrol, meal, etc., taken from the depots.
Time went on and the Turks did not appear. The Bulgarians accordingly returned on the morning of Monday, July 8/21. They began by disarming the Turkish prisoners. The scene described by Mr. Bogoyev, when the Bulgarians fired on the prisoners and slew at least ten of them, must have occurred at this stage. According to the explanation given at the time by the Bulgarian officer holding the station, the prisoners tried to take flight in the belief that the Turkish army was already in Adrianople. When the Bulgarians asked where the Turkish prisoners could have got arms, they were informed that these were supplied by the population. From that time on the Bulgarians watched the inhabitants of Karagatch vigilantly. Their houses were visited and they were ordered to hand over whatever had been taken by anybody from the depots within a certain time ("up to 3 o'clock in the afternoon), after which requisition •would be made by force and punishment made.
Towards evening domiciliary visitations were in fact instituted. It is not quite clear how the forty-five persons arrested were selected. One of them, the sole survivor, Pandeli (Panteleimon), declared that it was his twelve-year-old son who had taken some meal from the depot; he, the father, had restored the booty, as was ordered, the original order having been that the goods restored should be deposited in the streets, but after that he and his comrades in misfortune had been detained to carry the sacks to the station. Pandeli described what followed in detail and his story, tested by the Commissioner making the report by comparison with two other witnesses, one grecophil, the other bulgarophil, is here reproduced. He said:
In the evening (July 8/21) the wretched creatures were bound together in fours by their belts and conducted along the Marache road by an escort of sixty soldiers. Their money and watches were taken from them before they were bound. They were told that they were being taken to Bulgaria, but when the soldiers got near the bridge across the Arda, someone shouted, "Run quickly, the train is coming!" They crossed the bridge and reached the opposite bank. There they were placed in line, their faces to the river, and pushed into the water. A horrible scene followed. While the poor devils floundered about the soldiers fired on any whose heads appeared above the water. Pandeli owed his life to a desperate movement. As he fell into the water he broke with an effort the belt fastening him to his companions. In the water, alone and free, he began to swim, raising his head from time to time. The shots directed at him luckily did not hit him. He then pretended to be dead, and lying on his back, allowed the current to carry him along. For some time he lost consciousness, then found himself stopped by a tree. He crawled up the wooded bank on all fours. A coachman seeing him fled, terrified by his looks. During the night he made his way back to the Hildyrym quarter and went to the house of his apprentice. (Pandeli is a carpenter in the Karagatch steam mills.)
The photograph (p. 122) shows the corpses of some of the forty-four victims who were fished out of the river some days later. The miserable episode did not come under the cognizance of the responsible Bulgarian authorities, but there can be no doubt of its truth. The panic and excitement of the final moments of departure can not be held to exonerate those guilty of it. The member of the Commission who made inquiry on the spot, learned from the brothers of the Assumption that other persons were arrested for acts of pillage, but they were left as they arrived at the station, people shouting to the escorting soldiers from the carriages of the last train: "Hurry up, the train is going." This happened at three o'clock in the morning on July 9.
The departure of the Bulgarians was then a hurried one. It follows that it is false to urge that "the Bulgarians, knowing that the Turks were going to return, had made every preparation for the final massacre"; that "they were going to massacre the Mussulmen, while the Armenians, whom they had carefully armed, were to be compelled to exterminate the Greeks." The Bulgarians
made no preparations for their own departure, and the "nightmares" spoken of in the quotation from Mr. Pierre Loti's article in L'Illustration, never had any existence save in the lively imagination of the Greek population which had been heated by agitators. The dramatic picture of the "last night," as described by the eminent French author, thus betrays but too distinctly the sources from which it was drawn. Take one more detail in the same article. Mr. Loti speaks of a young Turkish officer, Rechid-bey, son of Fouad, "captured" by the Bulgarians in a final skirmish on the retreat. "They (the Bulgarians) tore out his two eyeballs," says our author, "cut off his two arms and then disappeared. This was their last crime." Assuredly Rechid's death did produce a profound impression in the Turkish army, where he had many friends. The Commission's investigator was shown the monument set up to his memory and recently consecrated on the Mustapha Pasha road. But as a matter of fact the Turk showed more equity than their admirer. When the investigator went to the office of the Tanine at Constantinople to verify the facts, he was told by the paper's special correspondent in Adrianople that in the affray Rechid had received a mortal wound from which death followed instantaneously. The mutilation was but too real; the torture, however, an absolute invention. Even at Adrianople people talked of Rechid's dismembered ears and hands—his hands being beautiful—but no one ever spoke of his eyes being put out.
The account given above of affairs in Adrianople is far from exhausting the evidence collected by the Commission. The curious reader may find fuller particulars in the Appendix, where he can read the documents in proof of what we say. Unfortunately the major portion of the depositions taken at Adrianople itself can not be published or reported in detail since they were given confidentially. But the reader will readily understand that it is those very depositions, collected on the spot, which corroborate and support those used by the Commission in this report.
In order to gain a personal idea of events in Thrace in the course of the two wars, a member of the Commission went to see the villages situated to the east of Adrianople. He visited the villages of Havsa, Osmanly, Has-Keui, Souyoutli and Iskender-Keui. The first of these had been visited by Mr. Pierre Loti, who gave a description of it in L'Illustration. Unfortunately while describing the Bulgarian atrocities in this mixed village, Mr. Loti has not been informed that two steps off, at Osmanly, there was a Bulgarian village where the Turks had taken their revenge.
Havsa is composed of two quarters, the Mussulman and the Christian. The Christians here call themselves "Greeks" but they are Bulgarian patriarchists. Their quarter was not burned. The whole population remained there. The Turkish quarter, on the other hand, was almost entirely burned. The Turkish population fled the village on the Bulgarians’ approach, that is to say
at the beginning of the first war. These Turks took refuge in Constantinople and in Asia Minor. They are now beginning to come back; fifty or sixty families have arrived from Brousse, the Dardanelles and Akcheir. One might have thought that everyone had gone; there could have been no one left to suffer atrocities. Unhappily there were some exceptions. Rachid, an aged inhabitant of the village, told what follows to a member of the Commission. Four Turkish families had been unwilling to take flight. They remained. The names of the heads of these families were Moustafa, Sadyk, Achmed Kodja, and a fourth whose name has escaped 'us. These families were slain by the Bulgarians, who also put to death Basile Papasoglou, Avdji, Christo, Lember-Oghlu and Anastasius. All the women were outraged, but it is not true, as Mr. Loti asserts, that they were killed. Only one woman, Aicha, was killed; and the wife of Sadyk, who was among the slain, went out of her mind.
In the village there were two mosques. One of the mosques was turned into an ammunition depot. Another, described by Mr. Loti, was really seriously damaged. The member of the Commission found traces of blood on the floor. The rubrics from the Koran in the interior were in part spoiled, the Moaphil place destroyed, the marble member half broken, the pillars smashed. The dung seen by Mr. Loti in the minaret had gone, but some traces of it remained. A hole made in the cupola enabled one to get above the higher portion of the ceiling; a hole had been made in the middle of the ceiling and Rachid stated to the member of the Commission that from here, too, dung was spread on the floor below. The sacrilegious intention was even more clearly visible in the way in which the cemetery was treated. "All" the headstones were not broken, as Mr. Loti states, but some of them were. It is likewise true that one of the graves is open. In the bottom of the trench the member of the Commission found the remains of a brandy bottle; relic of a joyous revel! Justice compels the further remark, that the authors of this infamous deed are unknown, and that there are grounds for attributing it to the people of the locality, rather than to the regulars. It was noted that the miscreants confined their attentions to recent headstones and graves, leaving the older ones.
As has already been said, at a short distance from Havsa is Osmanly, a Bulgarian village, and there the Turks took their revenge, when they returned after the retreat of the Bulgarians. There were 114 Christian Bulgarian houses in the village. Not a single one was spared. The churches in the villages were burned and razed to the ground. The member of the Commission could see nothing but the outline of the precincts and the remains of the walls. Research in the interior recovered nothing but the debris of two chandeliers. The member of the Commission, investigating among the cinders, discovered some bits of half burned paper; they were fragments of the Gospel and the Sunday office, in Greek characters (see p. 125). The population had fled to Adrianople and from the Bulgarian frontier, i. e., towards Our Pasha. The whole of the cattle had been lost. Some dozen villagers were, however, working at the harvest in the village. They
explained to the member of the Commission that the oxen they were using belonged to Turks from other villages whose farmers they themselves were.
The next village is Has-Keui, a repetition of Havsa. The Bulgarian quarter (here they are called "Greeks," and they sing in Greek at church) remained intact, but the cattle were carried off together with the produce of the harvest. Our traveling companion, a Turk, ventured the hypothesis that this might have been the work of bashi-bazouks. But a peasant who was present and spoke in Bulgarian to the member of the Commission, said distinctly that it was "askers," the regulars who had pillaged and taken everything without payment. Going on to the Mussulman quarter, we found it still in a state of devastation. Of fifty-five houses only twenty-five remained. This portion of the village was empty, and it was explained to the Commission that the men of the village had gone to Adrianople in search of their families. The refugees who had returned (some twenty-five or thirty families) had gone to dwell in the Christian quarter.
Of the two mosques in the village, one had been entirely destroyed and razed level with the ground, and the school adjoining treated in the same way. The other mosque, which was converted into an ammunition depot, was also damaged, especially inside; several headstones in the cemetery have been broken down.
The two Mussulman villages situated between Has-Keui and Adrianople,— Souyoutli-dere and Iskender-Keui,—underwent the same fate as the preceding ones. Of the eighty-seven houses in Souyoutli only eight or ten, with forty or fifty inhabitants, remain. The population had gone to Anatolia. Those who return dwell among the ruins, which they arrange as best they can to shelter them from sun and rain. They call these wretched habitations "colibi" (huts).
Iskender-Keui suffered even more severely. Out of eighty houses but four or five remain. The population fled to Adrianople; all have now returned. The few houses still standing owe their preservation to the fact that they were occupied by Bulgarians. The mosque and school of the village were razed level with the ground.
The conclusion to be drawn from this description is, that as a matter of fact, at the outbreak of the first war the Bulgarians destroyed the Mussulman villages, that the population fled almost to a man, and that the national Mussulman institutions, mosques and schools, suffered specially. Evidently these are not isolated or fortuitous events. They represent national tactics. Bulgarian officers have endeavored to explain this conduct to the Commission, pleading that the material of the houses was used to make winter cantonments for the army. Apart from the fact that such an explanation is equivalent to an avowal, it is inadequate to the extent of the devastation, and fails to meet the destruction of places of worship and schools.
Coming now to July, the Bulgarians began to retreat while the Turks assumed the offensive. Thrace again became the theater of war. Enver-bey is
accused with considerable unanimity of having sent Arabian and Kurdish cavalry ahead of his regular troops. These "Arabs" are often indicated, in the victim's stories, as being the authors of crimes. The Commission has collected a body of evidence to the effect that Turkish officers themselves sometimes warned those whom they were protecting of the approach of the "Arabs," and told them to be on their guard. An "Arab" soldier, a Catholic, actually admitted to one of his friends that the express orders of their captains were first to burn and ravage, then to kill all the males, next the women (here again all took flight) ; and that he had personally carried out the orders given him. We should not mention this story were it not that it comes from an excellent source, the name of the soldier being known to us, though we naturally refrain from giving it here.
These remarks made and conclusions established, we may pass to another part of Thrace, in order to follow the advance of the Turkish offensive, in relation to alleged excesses.
The member of the Commission had opportunity of free conversation with the Bulgarian refugees in Constantinople itself. They passed through Constantinople in groups. The Commission's member did not encounter the group of ninety persons from the villages of Tchanaktche, Tarf, Yeni-Tchiflik, Seimen and Sinekeli; nor the group of 190 from Baba-Eski and Lule-Bourgas. But the third group of sixty-two persons was still there. There were hardly any but old people, women and children. Most of them Were refugees from the villages of Karagatch (130 houses), Koum-seid (twenty-eight houses), and Meselim (ten houses), peopled by Bulgarians whom the Turks had brought from the village of Bourgas.
The following is the somewhat rambling story told to the Commission by an inhabitant of Koum-seid, who had reached Constantinople on the previous night, still haunted by recollected horrors:
It was Wednesday the 3d (16th). It was night and the village slept. All at once the Turks arrived. * * * The women and children were in a frenzy. * * * They asked for money. They killed many people. Nicolas the shopkeeper (bakal) was killed, Stoyan Kantchev was killed and also his son, fifteen years old. Next came the turn of Demetrius Stoyanov, Saranda Medeltchev, Demetrius Gheorgiev, Petro Stoyanov, Heli Athanasov and his brother. Cone Athanasov (these are his children); next Nicolas Gheorghiev, his wife and his twelve year old son; Demetrius Daoudjiski. Demetrius Christov, Christo Dimitrov—120 persons were gathered together in a single house; the Arabs arrived and asked them "Who are you ?" and they replied "We are Greeks." Thereupon they were asked for money. Everything was taken. Their pockets were searched. On the cries of the victims the cavalry came up. They did not touch the people; it was the "Arabs" who attacked them. The attack on the village did not last more than fifteen minutes. Then the Turks went away in the direction of Lule-Bourgas. * * * However, the next day more "Arabs" arrived. * * *
As the Commission left Constantinople, they met everywhere in Thrace the traces of this Arab cavalry, following on local reprisals and hatreds, and the excesses of the bashi-bazouks who took advantage of the anarchy inevitable in transition from one regime to another.
Unhappily time did not allow the Commission to visit the places which bore the first brunt of the rage of the Turkish army when it resumed the offensive; but the evidence collected by them at Constantinople and in Bulgaria, when collated with the reports of special Armenian delegations and some well authenticated documents emanating from a fresh official source, may supply the defect of personal observation. It seems that at the moment of crossing the frontier, which had appeared for some months so definitively established by the Bulgarian conquest, two sentiments ruled in the Turkish army and population. There was vengeance on those of their Christian subjects who had joined friendship with the Bulgarian invaders in the first instance, and then with the Armenians. The Greeks, although they too had suffered at the hands of the Turks, were rather on their side. They too profited by Turkey's recovery to wipe out the traces of Bulgarian domination and reestablish their own national pretensions. They therefore hailed the Turks' return and often served them as guides and spies. The second feeling, natural enough in the Moslem population returning with the army to deserted villages, was to recover their goods and take them away from their new owners.
At Rodosto, retaken July 1/14, by 200 volunteers who arrived on board an Ottoman gunboat, the first act of the reestablished Ottoman power was the following proclamation to the Christian and Jewish population of the Sandjak:
Anyone in possession of goods or arms belonging to the government or cattle or goods belonging to emigres in the local population, which have been appropriated during the Bulgarian occupation, is invited to come and restore them to the Special Commission sitting at Rodosto. Two days' delay are allowed, starting from today (July 5/18) for those who are in Rodosto, three days for those dwelling in the villages. After the lapse of this delay any one found with appropriated goods in his possession will be treated with all the rigor of the laws.
But the volunteers and emigres returning home did not wait for the end of this nominal delay. The moment of their arrival they began pillaging and massacring the indigenous population. The volunteers had but just disembarked at Rodosto when they slew the Bulgarian commissary who handed the town over to them; they divided themselves into groups, with four or five bashi-bazouks at the head of each, and hastily organized pillage and massacre. They slew the Armenians whom they met in the market place, then the people being once shut up in their houses, ransacked the houses under pretext of searching for Bulgarian soldiers and officers there. The foreign consuls intervened; then the assailants turned their activities to the country outside the town, where no
control could be exercised. The results were nineteen corpses buried in Rodosto and eighty-one victims disappeared and evidently slain in the fields. This last figure should be higher,—some put it at 300. The more well-to-do had to pay for their safety between twenty and sixty Turkish pounds a head. Money, jewels and watches disappeared. Even so they were well off, for at eight hours’ distance from Rodosto, in Malgara, the catastrophe assumed much larger proportions. There the population was taken by surprise; there were no consuls. The heads of the Armenian community were arrested by the Governor at Rodosto, The Bulgarian police had just quitted the town, which for a day remained without any authorities or public force (July 1 and 2, old style). We can not here transcribe the eloquent story told by the Armenian delegation of what happened at Malgara in this state of anarchy.The reader will find it in the Appendix. But some points, common to the whole of this work of destruction, may be mentioned. Here again the motive is the same as at Rodosto and everywhere else; the military commander of the place addresses the Armenian notables summoned before him, in these terms:—-"Armenian traitors, you have in your possession arms and other objects stolen from the Moslems." A sub-lieutenant uses the other argument referred to:—"You other Armenians, you have largely assisted the Bulgarians, but today you shall have your reward.” Such terms encouraged the population not to wait until legal measures were taken. On the second and third days of the occupation public criers in the Armenian quarters order "those who have stolen goods belonging to Moslems or who are in possession of arms, to give them up." On the fourth day an opportunity for beginning the attack presents itself. Two terrified Armenians, on being called on by the soldiers to show them the Ouzoun-Keupru road, run away instead of answering. The signal is given; the soldiers, the crowd, put lighted torches soaked in petrol to the houses of the culprits; and the burning of the Armenian quarter begins. At the same time pillage and massacre are going on in the market. Some Armenian soldiers stop the fire, but it breaks out again in the market and thanks to the strong wind assumes terrifying proportions. Explosions of barrels of benzine, alcohol, etc., are heard; the crowd takes them for hidden bombs. Finally the Kaimakam, the representative of civil authority, arrives at Malgara, accompanied by the captain of police and a policeman. Even by standing surety for their lives, he hardly succeeds in persuading-the frantic Armenians to come out of their hiding places and organize a little band of some fifty to sixty young people who get the fire under. Results, in the town itself, to say nothing of the environs: twelve Armenians killed, ten wounded, eight disappeared, seven imprisoned, eighty-seven houses and 218 shops burned; a material loss amounting to ?T80,000. [Le Jeune Turc of August 12 actually admits that 139 houses and 300 shops were burned at Malgara. It adds: "with the exception of two houses the entire village of Galliopa, consisting of 280 houses, was destroyed by fire; 299 houses were the prey of flames in eleven Christian villages, thirty-five persons were killed and nine wounded.] This time there was also an epilogue.
An Ottoman commission of inquiry tries to cast the responsibility of the pillage and assassinations * * * on the Armenians themselves.
The real massacre begins however when the Turkish army meets Bulgarians on its route, and the events described at Rodosto and Malgara fade before those which took place at Boulgar-Keui, "a Bulgarian village," as its name shows. Boulgar-Keui is, or rather was, a village of 420 houses some miles from the town of Kechane and not far from another village of 400 houses, Pichman-Keui, whose fate was similar. The information collected by the Commission as to these atrocious events comes from different sources and the evidence agrees in the smallest details. The refugees, women for the most part, scattered in all directions. They were found at Haskovo and Varna in Bulgaria, where two agents of the Balkan Relief Society questioned them and transmitted their depositions to a member of the Commission,—depositions that though coming from places very far distant from each other are identical in terms. Another member of the Commission was able to meet in Constantinople a male survivor of the horrors of Boulgar-Keui and thus obtained possession of some unpublished Greek official documents which confirm and complete the oral depositions. From all these sources an absolute certainty emerges that the purpose was the complete extermination of the Bulgarian population by the military authorities in execution of a systematic plan.
These events recall those at Rodosto and Malgara, but the end is different. The Bulgarian peasants, like the populations of the towns referred to, had as a matter of fact appropriated the goods of the Turkish emigres, their coats, domestic utensils, cash, etc. The Turkish soldiers in their turn lay hands on what they can find; they demand money, they carry off clothes, they lead off the big cattle over the frontier to the village of Mavro. Thus a whole week passes, July 2-7. Soon, however, everything changes. The order is given to collect the whole male population at the bottom of the village to receive instructions. The witness spoken of above believed the order to be a lie and preferred remaining at home, thereby saving his life. Nearly 300 men appeared. They were all killed on the spot by a fusillade. Only three men escaped, one of them being wounded (John K. Kazakov). The depositions of the women complete the picture. At Haskovo they told the agents of the English Relief Committee that the Turks went from house to house seeking for male inhabitants over sixteen years of age. Two shepherds, Dimtre Todorov and George Matov, added that the Greeks helped the Turks to tie the Bulgarians' hands with cords. A young woman refugee at Varna described how her husband, father and two of her brothers were shot in front of their house. Another stated that at Haskovo she had seen the Greeks sprinkle her husband and some other men with petrol and then burn them. Other women at Varna confirmed this horrible story and added that the number of victims who perished in this way was twenty-three. A shepherd saw the same scene, hidden in a neighboring place of refuge. The
women put the total number of men killed at Boulgar-Keui at 450 (out of 700). The Constantinople witness adds that all this was going on up to July 29 (old style) when he left the village. At the end of this period the Turks began sticking notices on the walls that there was to be no more killing. A portion of the population believed it and returned. But as the male population returned killing began again by twos, threes and fives. The people were led into a gorge and there shot down. The witness saw that at Pitch-Bonnar and at Sivri-Tepe: in the first place he saw as many as six corpses and recognized one of the six as the "deaf" Ghirdjik-Tliya.
The methods employed with the women were different. They were outraged, and Greeks, clad, according to the witnesses, in a sort of uniform, did the same as the Turks. In the villages of Pichman, Ouroun-Begle and Mavro, the Greeks were indeed the sole culprits, and they outraged more than 400 women, going from one to another. Young men who tried to defend their betrothed were taken and shot. A woman of Haskovo described how her little child was thrown up into the air by a Turkish soldier who caught it on the point of his bayonet. Other women told how three young girls threw themselves into a well after their fiances were shot. At Varna about twenty women living together confirmed this story, and added that the Turkish soldiers went down into the well and dragged the girls out. Two of them were dead; the third had a broken leg; despite her agony she was outraged by two Turks. Other women of Varna saw the soldier who had transfixed the baby on his bayonet carrying it in triumph across the village.
The outraged women felt shame at telling their misfortunes. But finally some of them gave evidence before the English agents. They said that the Greeks and Turks spared none from little girls of twelve up to an old woman of ninety. The young woman who saw her father, husband and brothers perish before their house was afterwards separated from her three children and outraged by three Greeks. She never saw her children again. Another, Marie Teodorova, also saw her husband killed before her eyes, and then, dragged by the hair to another house, she was outraged by thirty Turks. Two of her three children were seriously wounded and one of them died at Varna. Sultana Balacheva is the old woman of ninety with wrinkled face, from the village of Pichman, who was outraged by five Turks.
Here are some extracts from secret Greek reports not intended for publication which will serve to show that the same outrages repeated themselves in all the countries in which the Turks took the offensive: "Yesterday evening (July 4/17) from the first hour of the night (t. e., sunset, alia Turca) to six o'clock, the Turkish population has invested the Greek village of Sildsi-Keui (Souldja-Keui to the northeast of Rodosto), set fire to it and massacred the whole village, women and children included, 200 families in all. The catastrophe was wit-
nessed by so and so [Since all these places have remained in possession of the Turks the necessity of concealing the names of the authors of the documents will be understood.] * * * No one escaped." Isolated massacres of shepherds and workers in the fields, during the same day, by Turkish soldiers and inhabitants, are also mentioned in the villages of Simetli, Karasli (both southeast of Rodosto), Titidjik, Karadje-Mourate, Kayadjik, Akhmetikli, Omourdje and Mouratli. On the same day (July 4/17) Turkish soldiers killed at Kolibia near Malgara the hegoumenos (abbot) of the Monastery of Iveria, Eudocimus, the priest Panayote and some other persons.
This was but the beginning. Since the population of the neighboring villages fled to Kolibia the Turks "after killing in the interior of the church, burned all the families of the neighboring villages that had found refuge there" (report on July 9). In Has-Keui, another village near Malgara, the Turks burned "a considerable number of families." In the same village (report of July 12) the officer ordered the mouktar (head man of the village) to procure him three girls for the night, "otherwise you know what will happen to you," the officer added, showing his revolver. The mouktar refused and bade the officer kill him rather * * * Then "the men were shut up in the church * * * all the women were collected in a spacious barn and the soldiers banqueted for twenty-four hours, outraging all the women from eight to seventy-five years of age." The army took with it quantities of young girls from each village. At Kolibia a young girl, pursued by a soldier, fell from a window. While her body was still breathing the soldier assaulted her.
The Greek report is at pains to add: "The caimacams demand that a declaration be signed to the effect that all these infamies * * * were committed by the Bulgarian army." The words explain why in the declarations published in August, 1913, in Le Jeune. Turc, signed by Greeks and written in the name of the population, the accusations against the Bulgarians are so numerous. The object was in fact to clear the Ottoman troops of all the crimes committed. [For example, at Has-Keui where according to the authority cited there were "a considerable number of families" killed or burned by the Turks. The following is the declaration of the village notables presented to the caimacam of the Haivebolou casa: "We deny categorically the malicious insinuations made against the Ottoman army and in rebutting them protest against crimes such as incendiarism and assassination perpetrated by the Bulgarian army in our town at Has-Keui and at Aktchilar-Zatar at the time of the Bulgarian retreat from these places." Signed Triandaphilou and Yovanaki, members of the administrative council of the casa, Greek notables: Father Kiriaco, representing the metropolitan, Dimitri, vicar of Has-Keui: Father Kiriaki, priest of Has-Keui: Polioyos, Greek commercial notability." See the Union July 24 which published in the same number a supplement entitled "Acts of Bulgarian Savagery in Thrace." The member of the Commission who visited another village of the same name, Has-Keui, near Adrianople, asked to see Constantinos, the priest of the village, who also signed a list equally long, of Bulgarian misdeeds there. (See Le Jeune Turc, Sept. 2.) The priest did not appear.]
Let us add one more report of July 9 on the events at Ahir-Keui (Aior-Keui to the east of Visa) which proves that the same system was applied over the whole area of the territories again occupied by the Turkish army: "Yesterday evening, July 7, the police selected to guard the inhabitants of Ahir-Keui sepa
rated men, women and children. All the men they beat pitilessly and wounded many with oxgoads; outraged the young girls and women, giving themselves up to libertinism throughout the night."
In this way this portion of Thrace was absolutely devastated. The Greek report of July 9 states that the Ottoman army "massacred, outraged and burned all the villages of the casas of Malgara and Airobol. Nine hundred and seventy families from the casa Malgara and 690 from the casa Airobol, i. e., a population of 15,960 persons, have been either killed or burned in the houses or scattered among the mountains." If this be regarded as an example of the exaggeration not uncommon in Greek sources, confirmation may be adduced from a Catholic paper. [La Croix, August 24-25, 1913.] "A commissionaire who came from Malgara and arrived yesterday August 23, at Adrianople, assures us that the whole number of villages burned or wholly destroyed round Malgara is not less than forty-five. He stated that he smelt the intolerable stench of many corpses as he crossed the fields in the neighborhood of Kechane." A month after this deposition the member of the Commission who went to Constantinople heard there the story of a Greek, an English subject. About a thousand Bulgarians, men, women and children, were still wandering in the mountains, whither they had fled before the horrors described. But they were surrounded by Ottoman troops between Gallipoli and Kechane and exposed to every imaginable kind of suffering. The witness saw numbers of terrible scenes and took some photographs. Under his very eyes a Turk opened the stomach of a child of seven years and cut it to pieces. The witness is known in Constantinople, and it is extremely important that his photographs should not be mislaid. We might still be ignorant of facts that have come to our knowledge; the whole of this persecuted population might have remained there, wandering among the mountains, awaiting the last stroke from the soldiers who surrounded them. Very luckily the Greeks made the mistake of taking these peasants for compatriots; they received permission from the authorities (who shared the error), to lead them to Lampsacus, at the other side of Gallipoli. Here the missions concerned themselves with their lot, and the Greeks sent a special steamer to bring them to Prinkipo. Only then did they discover that they were not Greeks but Bulgarians. They were thereupon driven out into the streets. Thanks to the intervention of the Russian Embassy and the aid of the Bulgarian exarchate they were reembarked and sent back to Bulgaria. Chief among them were women from Boulgar-Keui, 412 of whom were seen by the English at Varna, as their fellow villager reported when questioned at Constantinople by a member of the Commission.
The space between the frontier ceded at London (Enos Midia), and the old Bulgarian frontier was traversed by the Turkish army in three weeks. The soldiers arrived with views deducible from the facts. An Arab Christian soldier of the Gallipoli army, of which we have spoken above, when asked why he had
taken part in these atrocities, forbidden by his religion, replied confidentially in Adrianople, "I did as the others did. It was dangerous to do otherwise. We had the order first to pillage and burn, then kill all the men." * * *
Exceptions and distinctions were made however. There was a Bulgarian village, Derviche-Tepe, situated near two Turkish villages, one of which is called Khodjatli. When the Bulgarian army approached, during the first war, sixty Turks sought refuge with their Christian neighbors. They were given protection and did not suffer from the passage of the Bulgarian soldiers. Among others there was a rich cattle merchant who related the following story at Constantinople: "When the Turks returned they had the order not to touch the village. They said to the peasants: Be not afraid of us, since you saved our people; we have a letter from Constantinople to leave you in peace." But the exception confirms the rule. There were also exceptions in the contrary sense, as the history of the village of Zaiouf proves. Zaiouf was peopled by Albanians, Greek in religion. The next village, Pavlo-Keui, was Bulgaro-Moslem (pomak). During the first war the Zaioufians pillaged Pavlo-Keui, and then thought of baptizing the Pavlo-Keuians. They called a Greek priest, Demetrius, and he converted the village. The Turks, on their return, not only killed Demetrius; they razed the village to the ground. At the same time Aslane, the neighboring Christian village, suffered comparatively little. At Zaiouf, 560 persons were killed. On taking the offensive, the Turks transported their habits of pillage across the frontier. Among the villages destroyed in Bulgarian territory the Commission heard of Soudjak, Kroumovo, Vakouj, Lioubimits, etc. When according to the conditions of the treaty of peace, Mustapha Pasha had to be handed back to the Bulgarians, the Turks destroyed it completely, as is shown by the report of Mr. Alexander Kirov of October 19 (November 1), which is in the hands of the Commission. Mr. Kirov recounts that here too the return of the Turks during the second war was signalized by the massacre of the whole male population (eighteen persons). The old woman, who survived this appalling day, described how they killed them one by one amid the laughter and approving cries of the Moslem crowd. The headsman, a certain Karaghioze Ali, varied the mode of execution to amuse the mob. When a young man named Chopov asked to be killed more quickly, that he might not see such appalling scenes, Karaghioze Ali, smoking his cigarette, replied: "Be patient, my child; your turn is coming," and he killed him last. The old schoolmaster, Vaglarov, seventy years of age, was killed in the street, and throughout the day his head was carried by the beard from quarter to quarter. The mother of the writer of the report was killed on July 13/26, and thrown down a well. In the courtyard a portion of her hair, torn off with the skin, and her bloodstained garments, were found.
In Western Thrace traveling was impossible during the Commission's stay. Those places assigned to Bulgaria by the treaty of Bucharest, were inhabited equally by Greeks and Turks. After the departure of the Bulgarian army on
July 9 and 10 (July 22 and 23), the country was occupied by the Greek army and the population little disturbed, "probably thanks to the nomination of a European Commission of Inquiry" (i. e., the Carnegie Commission), in the view of a Bulgarian journal, Izgreve. After its departure, however, September 6/19 up to the time of the definitive arrival of the Bulgarian army, the population was entirely in the power of the republican militia, i. e., of the Greek andartes am Moslem bashi-basouks, grouped by the priests, schoolmasters and secretaries of the Greek metropolitans (bishops). The Bulgarian population, expecting no good at the hands of this militia, was panic struck and threw themselves on all sides into Dede-Agatch, where there were still some Greek regulars. But the military authorities did not permit them to enter the town, and the crowd of 15,000 refugees were stationed a quarter of an hour's distance off, in the Bulgarian quarter and barracks. On September 19, the last Greek troops left Dede-Agatch with the steamer, and the Greek Metropolitan advised the Moslem volunteers of their departure. This is why the refugees, with the exception of about a hundred, had no time to seek shelter in the town. They were discovered by the bashi-basouks "of the militia, and led to Tere and Ipsala like flocks of sheep." They passed the night at Ouroumdjik, where their money was taken from them and the schoolmaster from Kaiviakov, with his wife from Baly-Keui, were massacred. On the morning of September 23, they met upon their way a company of Bulgarian volunteers, who delivered the larger part of the refugees from the bashi-basouks. But during the retreat, the bashi-bazouks succeeded in massacring about one hundred women and children who had remained behind with the baggage, and they took away 100-150 women and children. The rest took the road for Bulgaria with their liberators. But on the morrow, September 24, there was another encounter with the bashi-basouks, near the village of Pickman-Keui. In this encounter 500 were slain and 200 women and children made prisoners. Newcomers had raised the total to 8,000. At the river Arda new slaughter awaited them. After the crossing they counted again and were but 7,200.
The lot of those who remained at Dede-Agatch was no better. A public crier shouted on several successive days the orders for the Bulgarians to quit the town; recalcitrants and those harboring them, to be punished like dogs. The frightened Greeks filled several wagons with Bulgarians and sent them to Bulgaria. On their way they saw two wagons full of Bulgarian women and children at the station at Bitikili, and two other wagons at the station at Soffli. The number of Bulgarian villages burned in Western Thrace amounts to twenty-two and the massacred population to many thousands.
In the Appendix will be found a selection of the documents on which this part of the report is based. In Servia, of course the Commission was not
accepted by the government and it was therefore compelled to rely on its own resources to prove the Servian thesis of the "Bulgarian atrocities." Nevertheless the documents contained in the English translation are official: the Commission obtained them by purchase from an intermediary. [We have not seen the book announced by the Serbische Correspondent of November 28/December 11, which appeared in Belgrade ("publication of the Servian Journalisten Verein) in English on the "Bulgarian atrocities," but the summary of the contents does not speak of official documents, which constitute the most important and only authentic source; and some of the photographs mentioned also appeared in a recent book by Mr. de Penennrun, "Quarante jours de guerre."] If the conclusion were allowable that, enough having been done to satisfy public opinion, the Servian Government was not displeased in at least allowing information to reach us, the Committee would rejoice thereat while regretting the attitude which Mr. Pachitch found it necessary to adopt in regard to the Commission. In the documents, we have kept whatever seemed to be first-hand information, what seemed to us trustworthy and contained no glaring exaggeration. It will be seen that the documents become the more convincing in consequence. They are, for the most part, official reports sent by the head of the General Staff of the different armies to the General Staff at Uskub, in response to an order from the latter dated June 20/July 3, No. 7669. ("In accordance with the order of the General Staff No. 7669 of the 20th inst," a phrase appearing at the head of many of the documents which we have omitted, in abridging them for publication.) Thus at the beginning of the war the Servian government took the steps necessary to secure that no single instance of "atrocities" committed by the Bulgarian soldiery should remain unknown to international public opinion. Unluckily for itself the Bulgarian government took no general step of an analogous kind, so that our data as to crimes of this order are necessarily incomplete.
By way of compensation we have, on the Bulgarian side, information of another kind presented spontaneously, so to speak, and recorded on his private initiative by Professor Miletits, in the depositions of eye witnesses of the destruction of Bulgarian villages during the Servian offensive. The refugees from the villages concerned were interrogated when they crossed the border, at Kustendil, on the state of things they had left behind them. We publish these among those depositions which refer to villages situated along the conventional boundary of the rivers Zletovska. Bregalnitsa and Lakavitsa, i. e., the boundary agreed upon by the two armies before the opening of hostilities. In the originals (transmitted to us in a French translation) the names of the witnesses,-eye witnesses in every case,-are given. Since the territories in question are actually Servian and the population has in part returned thither, we have thought it more prudent not to publish the names.
Concerning the regions round the old Serbo-Bulgarian frontier, the Commission has in its possession documents of two kinds. On the Servian side. since the Commission was unable to carry out their intention of going to Knjazevac
they had to be content with the receipt of the documents here published. On the Bulgarian side, the Commission actually visited the neighborhood of Vidine, which had suffered Servian invasion.
Examining first the country which ultimately became the theater of the war, the regions situated near the ancient Serbo-Bulgarian frontier, the Commission admits that the two reports published on the ravages produced by the Bulgarian invasion at Knjazevac,-the Servian official report and the Russian report are entirely convincing. In Mr. de Penennrun's book (p. 292) there is a photograph showing the room of a Servian doctor pillaged by the Bulgarians in the neighborhood of Knjazevac. Comparing this with the descriptions given by the prefect of the Timok department, Mr. Popovits (see Appendix H, 3), the accuracy of the latter is striking. Yet the first impression of the Russian witness, Mr. Kapoustine, on arriving at Knjazevac, was that of being in a town in its normal condition; and Mr. Popovits confirms this when he says that only isolated houses and shops were burned; twenty-six belonging to twenty owners. When however the houses and shops which appeared in a good state of preservation were entered, there is unanimous agreement (Mr. Popovits visited fifty and Mr. Kapoustine 100) in the sad admission of complete destruction. "It is not a case of mere pillage," says Mr. Kapoustine, "it is something worse; something stupefying." "One was absolutely dumbfounded," Mr. Popovits adds, "by the reflection that all that could have been done in so short a time, when there were, as the inhabitants assured me, only 10,000 soldiers." In fact, the pillagers were not content with carrying off the things of which they could make some use. What one might call a fury of gratuitous destruction seems to have led the destroyers on. They must have been drunk to behave as they did. Whatever could not be carried off was spoiled; the furniture was destroyed, Jam thrown into the water-closets, petrol poured upon the floor, etc.
In the environs it was still worse. The peasants told Mr. Kapoustine that the Bulgarian soldiers went through the villages in groups of fifteen or twenty, pillaging houses, stealing money and outraging women. Mr. Kapoustine did not succeed in tracing the outraged women. But as the Commission knows from personal experience, the difficulty of conducting an inquiry of this nature, especially when the women go on living in the villages, they could not feel Justified in rejecting the testimony of inhabitants who know that "in the village of Boulinovats seven women were outraged, two among them being sixteen years old; at Vina nine women, one of whom was pregnant; at Slatina, five, one of whom was only thirteen."
Turning from this to the impressions actually gained by the Commission in Bulgarian territory, it must be admitted that it is unfortunately true that the same methods were employed by the Servian invaders towards the Bulgarian population. Let us begin however by saying that we have seen homage rendered to the superiority of the Servian command in the Bulgarian press itself. A
correspondent of the Bulgarian paper Narodna Volia felt constrained to admit that "to the honor of the Servian military authorities," there were in the village of Belogradtchik, occupied by the Servians on July 9/22, "few excesses or thefts committed by the army. Such as there were took place in the course of the first day and remained secret. The houses and the shops, where there was nobody, were ravaged. But on complaints being made by the citizens, the guilty soldiers were punished. The commandant, Mr. T. Stankovits, from Niche, a deputy in the Skupshtina, showed himself resolute in preserving order and stopping any attempts at crime." The same can not be said of the Bulgarian military authorities in the Knjazevac affair, on the admission of Bulgarians themselves, collected by the Commission.
But with this single exception the procedure in the one case was the same as in the other; another Servian socialist paper, the Radnitchke Novine, admitted it frankly. It was in the villages that the population suffered most. "Quantities of people," the Narodna Volia continues, "were forced to hand over their money. In the villages of Kaloughere and Bela the gallows are still standing by which the Servian "committees" terrorized their victims. On the "committees" there was even a priest. Whole flocks of sheep, goats, pigs, oxen and horses were lifted. All the seeds that could be discerned were dug up. All the clothes and all the furniture were taken. The Bulgarian villages near the frontier naturally suffered most. Whole caravans came and went full of booty. The Radnitchke Novine speaks of "heaps of merchandise and booty taken to Zayechare and sold there. Also no small number of women were violated." The Commission can authenticate the truth of the statements in these papers by what was heard and seen at Vidia and in the neighborhood. Before leaving the Balkans a whole day was spent in visiting the village of Voinitsa, and taking photographs there.
This village, in the Koula canton, comprised sixty-three houses; thirty-two were totally burned and the rest plundered and ruined. The Commission summoned some of the old men who had remained in the village after the arrival of the Servian troops. One of these old men, "Uncle" Nicholas, aged eighty, was killed in his house and his corpse covered with stones; the Commission photographed his tomb, where a simple wooden cross is to be seen. Another old man, "Uncle" Dragane, aged seventy, was also killed. A third, Peter Jouliov, aged seventy-three, had the idea of going up to the Servians with bread and raki (brandy) in his hands. For only reply one soldier ran him through with his bayonet and two others fired on him. "You have killed me, brothers," he cried as he fell. When the soldiers went, he crawled on his stomach some yards, to the nearest shelter. There for two days and two nights he lay in hiding in the forest without eating. His wounded foot was swollen and he had found no means of dressing it in the village of Boukovtse. At last on the ninth day he reached the Servian ambulance. The doctor made a dressing for him
and the old man thanked him and gave him six apples. "You do not belong to this place, I see," said the doctor, "since no one but you has given me anything. You are a man of God; thank you." Peter Jouliov himself told the Commission this simple and touching story.
At Voinitsa there were also some old women who suffered. Three of them were killed: Yotova Mikova, aged seventy; Seba Cheorgova, seventy-five and Kamenka Djonova. A witness, repeatedly beaten by the Servians who asked him why the population had fled, saw them set fire to the houses; only one was saved, and on it some one had scrawled in chalk the word Magatsine, to show that it was a food depot. Other witnesses saw the soldiers carrying off stolen furniture, carpets, woolen stuff prepared for carpet making, etc. Some peasants who thought that we were a government commission, sent to inventory their losses, brought us long lists of them. Here are some of the papers which we kept for information, after explaining to the villagers the mistake they made:
From the losses here sustained by a single family,-father and two sons, amounting to fr. 19,500 (and the prices are not overstated, so we were assured by the inhabitants of Vidine), some idea may be formed of the enormous figures of the estimated cost of the Balkan War to the inhabitants. The loss caused the Servian peasants by the Bulgarian invasions at Knjazevac is rated in the document we publish at fr. 25,000,000 or 30,000,000. No one, as far as we are aware, has tried to estimate the loss caused the Bulgarian peasants at Belogradtchik and Vidine by the Servian invasion.
In the principal area of military operations, in the canton of Kratovo, Kotchani, Tikveche, Radovitch, excesses are naturally to be expected of a different order from those due to military incursions on the Serbo-Bulgarian frontier. Here were two armies face to face for months at a short distance from one another. Each accused the other of provocation and acts of bad faith. The Bulgarians thought they were sure to defeat the old ally and new enemy at the first encounter. The Servians rejoiced in advance in the opportunity of restoring Servia's military reputation and revenging the defeats of 1885. Each side saw in the issue of the conflict the solution of difficulties that were, from the national standpoint, questions of life and death. The conflict over, the one side said, "We are not vanquished," and the other, after securing the price of victory, declared, "For the first time we have really fought; here are adversaries worthy of us." "Yes," Mr. de Penennrun agrees after seeing the two armies, "From the beginning this great war was savage, passionate. Both sides are rude men and knowing them as I know them I have the right to say that they are adversaries worthy of one another." [Quarante jours de guerre dans les Balkans. Chapelot, Paris, 1913, pp. 39-40, 183.]
The "savage war" opened in a way that was savage in the highest degree. The first shock was peculiarly cruel and sanguinary; it was to decide the fate of the campaign. The general staff of the voyevoda (Poutnik) (commander-in-chief), puts the losses of the two Servian armies during the one night attack (June 16/29 to 17/30) at 3,200 men: almost all the men who fell were slain by bayonet or musket blows, even after surrender. Mr. de Penennrun, who makes this statement, goes so far as to suppose that this Bulgarian fury was intentional and decreed by the commandant, who saw in it a means of striking terror and so of victory. According to him, the "atrocities were almost always enjoined by the officers on their men, who, despite their native harshness, hesitated to strike other Slavs, but yesterday their brothers in arms." The spirit of Mr. Savov's telegram already known to us seems to confirm this supposition, since it enjoins the commandant to "stir up the morale of the army," and teach it to "look upon the allies of yesterday as enemies." However that may be, the Servian documents we publish bearing almost exclusively on these first days of the war, June 17-19 to 25, do prove abundantly that this end was attained and much exceeded.
The reader's attention is drawn in the first instance to documents 1, 3, 7 10 (Appendix H). Here we have soldiers miraculously surviving from fights in which they were wounded, after enduring the same sufferings as their comrades who lie dead on the field of battle. They can recount the treatment inflicted by the. Bulgarians on the wounded, and when they do so they speak as victims. The Bulgarian soldier's first movement was always the same,-to steal the money and valuables on the body which would soon be a corpse. After stripping the wounded man, the second movement,--the intoxication of combat being somewhat dissipated,-was not always the same. Should he be killed or no ? Captain Gyurits (Appendix H, 2) tells us that he heard the Bulgarian soldiers discussing the question among themselves, and that massacre was decided on by the officer. Lieutenant Stoyanovits tells us that the men, after pillaging him, prepared to go off; but one of them reminded the others that there was still something to do, and then two of the soldiers ran him through with their bayonets, and the third struck him with the butt end, but without killing him. Lieutenant Markovits survived, after being pillaged, because the Bulgarian sanitary staff who had stripped him of his valuables did not want the trouble either of killing him or conveying him to hospital, as he asked them to do; instead they left him lying in the forest for three days until, on June 19, he was found there. Prisoners who were not wounded were pillaged likewise, and then kept with a view to extracting information from them (case of Lioubomir Spasits, Appendix H, 3) or let go and then fired on (Miloshevits, Appendix H, 4 (c)). There were cases however in which those who had money to offer were set free while those who had none had their throats cut. Cases were also quoted of whole bodies of prisoners being shot after capture. On the other hand a case is mentioned in which some wounded prisoners not only were taken to the Bulgarian hospital but made their escape, after they were restored to health, through the complicity of a Bulgarian sergeant (Appendix I, 4 (c) ).
All this naturally refers only to cases in which the men were able to deliberate and choose. The horrors of battle itself, during which men were actuated and dominated solely by its fury, were appalling and almost incredible. The most ordinary case is that described in full detail in the two medical reports we publish. The profound impression produced by the death of Colonel Arandjelovits, who was killed during the retreat of July 8/21, and whose death is described in the first reports, is largely due to the personality of the victim, an officer known and loved by everyone, and decorated by King Ferdinand for his share in the siege of Adrianople. The scientific facts were that the colonel, grievously wounded but still alive, was finished by a discharge in the back of his neck and a bayonet thrust at his heart. [See photograph of Mr. Arandjelovits in Mr. de Penennrun's book, p. 292.] The nine soldiers killed during the engagement of July 9/22, perished in the same way, as the second report shows. They were wounded, more or less seriously, by bullets from a distance; then finished by
violent blows on the head delivered close at hand with the butt end or bayonet, or by a discharge. There are quantities of instances of wounded Servian soldiers being stabbed to make an end of them.
Worse still, killing did not content them. They sought to outrage the dead or even to torture the living. Here we have the really savage and barbarous side of the second war. Some of the cases may have been exaggerated or inexactly reported. But they are so numerous that the agreement of the witnesses alone proves their authenticity. We will set them down in the order in which they appear in the documents, as indicated:
1. In the fight that took place near Trogartsi, Servian corpses were found with mutilated parts stuck in their mouths.
4. On June 21 Zivoin Miloshevits and Bozidar Savits had their tongues cut out and chopped in pieces because they had no money to buy back their freedom with (H, I, 4 (c)).
5. On June 19 L. Milosavlevits saw the corpse of a Servian soldier with his eyes gouged out (H, I, 4 (c)).
6. Near the village of Dragovo a Servian corpse was fastened to a pillar with iron bands and roasted-seen by Corporal Zivadits Milits (H, I, 4 (c) ).
7. On June 17 a Servian prisoner was thrown up in the air amid cries of hurrah! and caught on bayonets-seen by Arsenie Zivkovits (H, I, 4 (c) ). The same case is described elsewhere, near the Garvantoi position.
9. On June 25 Captain Spira Tchakovski saw the roasted corpse of a Servian soldier to the north of the village of Kara Hazani (H, I, 5).
10. Captain Dimitriye Tchemirikits saw two roasted corpses, one near the Shobe Blockhouse, another near the village of Krivolak (H, I, 5).
11. Mutilated corpses, with hands and legs cut, have been seen by the patrol in various places (H, I, 5).
12. On the battlefield mutilated corpses are found. One corpse had the skin of the face taken off, another the eyes gouged out, a third had been roasted (H, I, 6).
13. At the positions between Shobe and Toplika, June 24-25, mutilated corpses are found, some with the eyes gouged out, others with ears and noses cut; the mouth torn from ear to ear; disemboweled, etc. (H, I, 6).
16. A Bulgarian lieutenant broke hands and crushed fingers under stones; evidence of Kosta Petchanats (H, I, 9).
17. At Kalimanska Tchouka the wounded left at the village of Doulitsa had their noses and ears cut, eyes gouged out and hands cut off (H, III, 7).
The Commission can find no words strong enough to denounce such outrages to humanity, and feels that the widest measure of publicity should be given to all similar cases, indicating the names of the culprits wherever possible, in order to curb barbaric instincts which the world is unanimous in blaming.
The Commission is not so well provided with documentary evidence as to the excesses which may have taken place on the side of the Servian army during the combat. Isolated cases, however, confirmed by documents and by evidence, show that the Servians were no exception to the general rule. In the Appendix will be found a proces-verbal taken by the Bulgarian military commission, which proves that five Bulgarian officers, Colonel Yanev (at the head of the Sixth Cavalry), Lieutenants Stefanov and Minkov, veterinary sub-lieutenant Contev and Quartermaster Vladev, were massacred. After having been taken prisoner at Bossilegrade on June 28/July 11, Colonel Yanev was ordered, on pain of being shot, to send the Bulgarian squadrons the order to give themselves up to the Servians. He obeyed, but his orders were not followed. The five officers were then taken outside and entrusted to an escort of ten Servian soldiers, who then shot them all, stripped off their boots and plundered them. The sixth, Doctor Koussev, had been wounded by a Servian soldier immediately after yielding, and this saved his life. A Servian doctor, Mr. Mitrovits, came to see him; expressed his astonishment and regret at seeing him wounded and conducted him to the Servian ambulance, whence he was conveyed to the Mairie. The precipitate retreat of the Servians, who had to abandon their own wounded, saved him. We have seen his deposition, which confirms the proces-verbal.
The conduct of the Servians on the battlefield is characterized further by the deposition of a Bulgarian officer in the 26th, Mr. Demetrius Gheorghiev, wounded near the Zletovska river during these same days at the beginning of the war (June 21/July 4). His story is as follows:
Our people had beaten a retreat. I crawled into the thicket. Near-by, in a clearing, a petty officer of the 31st was lying groaning. I advised him not to groan for fear of being discovered. I should have been discovered likewise. I was right. A Servian patrol passed, saw him and killed him. I was not seen, however; I was hidden in a hollow. A little further away from me, at a distance of three or four hundred paces, a petty officer of the 13th lay, Georges Poroujanov. I saw the patrol discover and assassinate him also. Finally, on June 22, the Servian ambulances appeared. I saw and called to them. They asked me, "Have you any money?" I had 900 francs. I replied "Yes." Then the ambulance men came up to me. One of them took the money. They thereupon put me on a stretcher and carried me to the village of Lepopelti.
The rest of Mr. Gheorghiev's story is omitted.After many difficulties, upon the refusal of the Belgrade doctor, Mr. Vasits, to attend to him because
he regarded him "as an enemy," Mr. Gheorghiev was taken to the Russian mission and there attended. [For the treatment of the wounded by the Servians, see also Chapter V.]
If the information as to the conduct of the Servian soldier on the field of battle does not amount to much, our Bulgarian documents call up a sad enough picture of the treatment they meted out to the population in the conquered territory.
Here again the accusations are mutual. We publish a Servian document (Appendix H, III) which gives a general description of the ravages produced in the theater of war, along the left bank of the River Zletovska and the right bank of the Lakavitsa. The document attributes the ruin of these villages, the destruction of property and the violence endured by the population, to the Bulgarians. This may be admitted so far as it concerns the Moslem population, who, according to the document, fled before the Bulgarians and returned later with the Servian army. But the other portion of the population was Bulgarian and it evidently can not have suffered at the hands of the Bulgarian army, except in so far as the population inhabiting the theater of war must inevitably suffer. We know from the Bulgarian document we publish that the opposite is the case, at least in case of the villages whose names reappear in the Servian and in the Bulgarian list, and in that of quantities of others not mentioned by the Servians. What we see is the Bulgarian population fleeing before the Servian army to escape violence and vengeance at the hands of the returning Turks, or awaiting their hour on the spot. The evidence of the refugees is formal and decisive. They were perhaps not sufficiently removed from the events to judge them fairly; but their intimate and profound knowledge of local conditions compensates for this.
Let us stop and consider these depositions from peasants, priests and schoolmasters. whose names are known to the Commission. We see everywhere the reappearance of the Servian army, giving the signal for exodus. It is true that the Servians sometimes declare that they are bringing with them "order and security," and threaten the population with burning and pillage, only in cases where those who have taken flight will not return. Some of the more credulous do return. What awaits them?
It must be recalled that the Servian soldiers do not arrive alone. They are accompanied by people who know the village and their inhabitants better. And there is Rankovits, a Servian comitadji turned officer, who had been carrying on propaganda in favor of King Peter in these same villages since March. Then there are the vlachs (Wallachians, Aroumanians) put in charge of the administration, because they are ready to call themselves "brothers of the Servians," on condition of being allowed to enrich themselves at the expense of the population. Their formula for the Bulgarian population, the most numerous, is as follows: "Up to now you have been our masters and pil-
laged our goods; it is now our turn to pillage yours" (Appendix H, IV). But the most important point to notice is that the Turks appeared with the Servian army, called by them to their aid and free to pursue them when their turn should come (see Chapter IV). The Turks had vengeance to enact for probable spoliation committed by the Bulgarian army; and in addition for forced conversions (Chapter IV). This is what happens. Take the village of Vinitsa (given in the Servian document as having been burned and ravaged by the Bulgarians, "during their retreat"). The Servian soldiers, as soon as they entered, began asking the villagers, "one after another, are they Servians or Bulgarians?" Anyone replying "Bulgarian" is forcibly struck. Then the Commander of the troops chose seventy peasants and ordered them to be shot. In other villages, as we shall see, the order was executed; here it was recalled and the peasants taken to Kotchani. Three days after the Servian entry, the Bulgarian army returns (June 27) and then leaves the village again. It is only then, after having tried Servian "order and security," that the population "mad with terror at the prospect of new tortures," leaves the village. The old people, however, remain. They are witnesses of the pillage of all the shops and all the houses of the Servians. In the Appendix will be found the names of the persons killed and tortured for the sake of their money, and women outraged at Vinitsa.
At Blatets, the same story. The Turks denounce Bulgarian "suspects^" Another witness says, they point them out "as being rich." Some twenty are imprisoned; a boy's eyes gouged out to make him say where there is money. Another is thrown into the fire for the same reason; whole quarters are pillaged and burned. Then the suspects are led away from the village. The officer cries "Escape who can!" The soldiers fire on the fugitives and bring them all down. At Bezikovo some twenty dead are noted, a child a year and a half old burned alive, three women outraged, two of them dying. Sixty houses are burned and the harvest also, and the stock carried off. In the village of Gradets, where the Servian cavalry promises "order and security," only a few old men are left and go to meet the soldiery. On hearing the promises, fifty to sixty peasants, who believe in them, return. Then by express order the Turks throw themselves on the houses; between sixty and seventy men are seized, led outside the village and there stabbed amid the despairing cries of the women who followed their husbands. The Turks want their share; they take three picked young girls and carry them off to their village with songs and cries. The next day the village is in flames. A day later the chase of the fugitives begins.
Some 300 went forth; only nine families reach Kustendil. The others are killed or dispersed. "The Servian bullets rained down like hail;" men, women, children fell dead. In the village of Loubnitsa the Servian soldiers asked the wife of a certain Todor Kamtchev for money. As she had none, they stabbed a child of four years old in her arms.
Red Cross the peasants paid fifteen, thirty, forty-five Napoleons, to escape the tortures awaiting them. The guide who points out the "rich men" here is Captain Yaa, an Albanian, a former servant in the Servian agency at Veles, now head of a band protected by the military government. Our witness concludes: "At Radovitch the Servian officers collected a lot of money." In the surrounding villages too "a great deal of money was extorted." The Servians undressed and searched a woman for money; then outraged her at Chipkovitsa. At Novo-Selo the women fled into the forest; but the men who remained were plundered. At Orahovitsa, a Turkish local magnate from Radovitch wants to have his share. He arrives, accompanied by Servian soldiers, and once more money is extorted from the women by burning their fingers; and arms are carried off.
These are fragments of the dismal annals of these days at the end of June (old style) in a small territory which afterwards became the property of the invading state. "Order" of a kind is restored, the conquest once accomplished, and some of the refugees have returned to their villages. We shall have further opportunity of returning to the "order" similarly established in the annexed territories. For the moment we add one observation. The things we have described, horrible as they are, show in their very horror abnormal conditions which can not last. Fortunately for humanity, nature herself revolts against "excesses" such as we have observed in the conflict of two adversaries. In blackening the face of the other each has tarred his own. After judging them on their own evidence, we have to remember that in ordinary times they are better than the judgment each is inclined to pass on the other and to impose upon us.
The reader who has perused the preceding pages and followed the endless chain of deplorable events studied and described by the Commission, has doubtless discovered the common feature which unites the Balkan nations, though it is necessary to discover that war is waged not only by the armies but by the nations themselves. The local population is divided into as many fragmentary parts as it contains nationalities, and these fight together, each being desirous to substitute itself for the others. This is why these wars are so sanguinary, why they produce so great a loss in men, and end in the annihilation of the population and the ruin of whole regions. We have repeatedly been able to show that the worst atrocities were not due to the excesses of the regular soldiery, nor can they always be laid to the charge of the volunteers, the bashi-basoitk.[This term of dismal memory has taken on an altogether fresh significance during the latest wars. A bashi-basouk is no longer necessarily a Turk. He is the volunteer, the Freischarler of all the belligerent nations without distinction; the Bulgarian comitadji, the Greek andarte; generally speaking he is any combatant not wearing the uniform of the regular.] The populations mutually slaughtered and pursued with a ferocity heightened by mutual knowledge and the old hatreds and resentments they cherished.
The first consequence of this fact is, that the object of these armed conflicts, overt or covert, clearly conceived or vaguely felt, but always and everywhere the same, was the complete extermination of an alien population. In some cases this object expressed itself in the form of an implacable and categorical "order"— to kill the whole male population of the occupied regions. We are in possession of some letters from Greek soldiers, of unimpeachable authenticity. These documents, though written in our own day, throw back to the time of the Assyrian conquest. "We have taken a small number of prisoners and them we have killed, such being the orders received * * * in order that the dirty Bulgarian race may not spring up again" * * * "We are,"—such is the order,— “to burn the villages, massacre the young, and spare none but the old people, children and minors." Here the intention is clearly to spare none but those no longer capable of carrying on the race and those still young enough to lose their nationality by receiving a Greek education.
It was the same in Turkey, as we have seen in describing the events which took place in the environments of Malgara and in Thrace generally. Men, women and children were separated, and all killed without exception. Here the testimony of the Christian Arab soldier shows that, at least in certain por-
tions of the Turkish army, when the offensive was taken, the "order" was given to proceed systematically. It would be too much to assume that the outrages committed on women were the realization of an "order."
The orders given to the Slav armies were perhaps a trifle less barbarous. It does not, however, follow that there was no intention of conquering the territory without maintaining an alien population there. "Orders of extermination" were not given, orders to the contrary were indeed given [see below]. But in private conversations the same idea is constantly met. What proves that it was not a mere mode of speaking, Is the fact that the Turkish population suffered at the hands of the Bulgarians, and the Albanian population at the hands of the Servians as well. As regards the Bulgarians, this is proved by the villages in which all the Turkish quarters were burned, and which were visited by the member of the Commission in Thrace. As to the Servians, we possess authentic evidence in the shape of a letter from a member of the Servian army, published in the Servian Socialist paper Radnitchke Novine, of October 9/22. The contents of this letter resemble only too closely the letters of the Greek soldiers. True, the reference here is to an expedition made to repress a revolt. "My dear Friend," writes the soldier, "I have no time to write to you at length, but I can tell you that appalling things are going on here. I am terrified by them, and constantly ask myself how men can be so barbarous as to commit such cruelties. It is horrible. I dare not (even if I had time, which I have not) tell you more, but I may say that Liouma (an Albanian region along the river of the same name), no longer exists. There is nothing but corpses, dust and ashes. There are villages of 100, 150, 200 houses, where there is no longer a single man, literally not one. We collect them in bodies of forty to fifty, and then we pierce them with our bayonets to the last man. Pillage is going on everywhere. The officers told the soldiers to go to Prisrend and sell the things they had stolen." The paper which published this letter adds: "Our friend tells us of things even more appalling than this (!); but they are so horrible and so heartrending that we prefer not to publish them."
The object of the Albanian expedition, referred to by the correspondent of the Radnitchke Novine, is known to have been the repression of the plans of the Albanians who had at this period revolted against the Servians. The Albanian revolt was represented by the Servians as the result of the activities of the Albanians in autonomous Albania, and at the same time of Bulgarian conspiracies. These two reasons are probable enough, but they do not exclude a third,— the state of mind of the Albanian population in subjection to Servia. This population had its own reasons for complaining of the Servian administration. The event is explained in a letter from Elbassan, published by a Bulgarian paper, (L'Echo de Bulgarie, September 28/October 11), and alleged to come "from a very reliable source." The Commission was not able to verify these statements, but there are no reasons for doubting them, in view of all that has been seen and heard:
On September 20 last (new style), the Servian army carried off all the cattle of the Malesia of Dibra. The herdsmen were compelled to defend themselves, and to struggle, but they were all killed. The Servians also killed the two chieftains of the Liouma clan, Mehmed Edem and Djafer Eleuz, and then began pillaging and burning all the villages on their way: Pechkapia, Pletza and Dochichti, in lower Dibra; Alai, Beg, Machi, Para, Oboku, Klobotchichta, and Solokitzi, in upper Dibra. In all these villages the Servians committed acts of horrible massacre and outrage on women, children and old people. In the town of Dibra itself the authorities published an order to the effect that the bazaar was not to be opened on Sunday or the inhabitants to come out of their houses on that day. Forty-eight notables were arrested. When the Servians saw that the inhabitants of the pillaged villages, of which a list has been given above, had come to reclaim their cattle and were surrounding the town, they had the notables brought out of prison and killed them in the most shameless way. Henceforth terror and despair reigned among the Albanians of Dibra and the neighborhood, and they rose in revolt. They attacked the Servians with arms, or with hatchets, stones and sticks; they killed some of them and drove the rest out of the town. Nearly all of the men who were killed were Servian officials; the soldiers who remained alive fled to the other side of the Radika river.
After this story, the truth of the general description published by the same paper on October 3/16 need not be doubted: [See also the Reichspost of September 29, and the enumeration of massacres committed in the first fortnight of September, 1913, as set forth in the petition of the meeting of Albanian representatives at Scutari on September 21, quoted above.]
The following villages, with a mixed Albanian and Bulgarian population, were pillaged and burnt—Lochnani, Lissitchani, Gitoche, Dibrichta, Harlichte, Dessovo, Gradechnitsa, Ptchelopek. Many Moslem families from these villages, including women and children, were pitilessly massacred. On entering the village of Portchassie, the regular Servian army led all the husbands outside the village, and then brought the wives thither to exact money from them in the shape of ransom, if they wanted their husbands set at liberty. After the ransom had been paid, however, the wretched men were shut up in the mosque, which was then blown up with four shells. In the village of Sulp, seventy-three Albanians suffered a horrible death, and forty-seven others from the village of Ptchelopek were basely assassinated. Was it not the Prefect of Krouchevo, when the Servian army returned from the Albanian frontier, who openly told them to burn all the villages situated between Krouchevo and Okhrida ?
Thus the Albanian petitioners, who on September 21 addressed themselves to the Great Powers in the name of the populations of Djakova, Ipek, Plava, Goussinie and the ex-vilayet of Kossovo, did not exaggerate when they stated, as regards this other theater of the revolt, that "the Servian and Montenegrin regular troops undertook and did everything, from the first day on which they
invaded the Albanian territory, either to compel the inhabitants to lose their nationality, or brutally to suppress the Shkiptar race."
Houses and whole villages reduced to ashes, unarmed and innocent populations massacred en masse, incredible acts of violence, pillage and brutality of every kind—such were the means which were employed and are still being employed by the Serbo-Montenegrin soldiery, with a view to the entire transformation of the ethnic character of regions inhabited exclusively by Albanians.
We thus arrive at the second characteristic feature of the Balkan wars, a feature which is a necessary correlative of the first. Since the population of the countries about to be occupied knew, by tradition, instinct and experience, what they had to expect from the armies of the enemy and from the neighboring countries to which these armies belonged, they did not await their arrival, but fled. Thus, generally speaking, the army of the enemy found on its way nothing but villages which were either half deserted or entirely abandoned. To execute the orders for extermination, it was only necessary to set fire to them. The population, warned by the glow from these fires, fled in all haste. There followed a veritable migration of peoples, for in Macedonia, as in Thrace, there was hardly a spot which was not, at a given moment, on the line of march of some army or other. The Commission everywhere encountered this second fact. All along the railways interminable trains of carts drawn by oxen followed one another; behind them came emigrant families and, in the neighborhood of the big towns, bodies of refugees were found encamped.
At Salonica the Commission visited one of these camps, and made inquiries of the Islamic Committee, whose business it was to transport the refugees to Anatolia. They were Turkish emigrants. Some of them had left their villages several weeks ago; they came from all parts of Macedonia, from Soundja, Djoumaya-Bala, Nevrocope, Petritche, Razlogue, Tchakova, Demir-Hissar, Osmanie, Berovo, Radovitch. At the beginning of September, when the Commission made its inquiry, about 135,000 emigrants had passed through Salonica since the beginning of the second war. Each steamer starting for Anatolia carried some 2,500 bound for Mersina, Adalia or Iskenderoum. Why were they quitting their villages ? The Commission wished to learn the reason from their own lips. Some of its members went to the camp, without taking the official guide, and entered into conversation with isolated groups of emigrants:— "Who are you, whence do you come, wherefore have you departed?"—"We have come"—the old man waved his hand to indicate the plain dotted with carts— "from twenty-six different villages. It has taken us twenty-five days to get here, and we have been here for ten. We were afraid of the Bulgarians."—"Why?" Thereupon we heard the story which the reader knows from the chapter on Thrace. "But this happened during the first war, and now?"—"Now * * * the Greeks have given us the order to go." "Whither are you going? Who is feeding you?" Silence. Nobody knows.
In this section we will attempt to answer a series of arguments used frequently to question the Greek identity of Macedonia.
"Greece officially denied the use of the name Macedonia after the Balkan wars." This is a very inaccurate argument. There are several examples of state institutions and private businesses using the name Macedonia which operate in Greece since the early 1900s. These are just a few of them:
Greece has been actively using the name Macedonia since its liberation from the Ottoman empire. If Greece's official position was to "deny the existence of Macedonia" how would it be possible for hundreds of private companies to be named after Macedonia?
"Greece has changed the "Macedonian" names of locations in the Macedonia region."The Greek names are older than the Slavic ones and most of them have their roots in ancient Greece. The Greek names of the towns in Macedonia are also mentioned in the Bible. A characteristic example is Thessaloniki. This city was founded in 315 bc by the Macedonian king Kasssandros and it was named after Alexanders' half sister - Thessaloniki. How could the Greeks change the name from Solun (as the Slavs claim) to Thessaloniki in 1912 if that was the original name? The name Thessaloniki is even mentioned in the bible by St Paul. Why did he address his letters (epistoles) to the people of Thessaloniki and not the to the people of Solun? What about the Greek names of towns inside FYROM used during the Ottoman times? Did Greece change them as well? "Today's 'Greeks' and ancient 'Hellenes have no relation between them."How is it possible for the people who live in the same region, speak the same language and have the same names and culture not to be descendants of the ancient inhabitants of the region? Similarly we could say that today's Egyptians are not descendants of ancient Egyptians and today's Chinese people are not descedants of ancient Chinese. The name 'Greek' is in fact ancient as well as the famous philosopher Aristotelis verifies: "...and she was not there forever, but after the cataclysm of Defkalion, which occurred in the Hellenic area, in fact, in the ancient Hellas, which was around Dodoni, and it changed many times the flow of Acheloos river. In that area live the Selloi and the ones that were once called Graecoi and are now called Hellenes..." [Aristotelis Meteorologika, I, 14] "There is a large Macedonian minority in Greece"There is no "Macedonian minority" in Greece because there is no such nationality. There is a small group of people who speak a Slavic dialect which is in fact different from what is claimed to be the "Macedonian language" These people are not a "Macedonian minority" as they consider themselves Greeks. There is also an even smaller group of Slav propagandists who are trying to create a Macedonian minority in Greece. Anyone who didn't consider him/herself Greek could and should have left Greece during the exchange of populations in 1919. "One million people in Greece consider themselves Macedonians"In the 1996 parliament elections in Greece the political party of the people who claim to be a "Macedonian minority" gained 3.485 votes (official result). In the 2000 parliament elections they didn't take up part at all. Of course there is no doubt of the integrity of the election procedures since Greece is a member of the European Union. If there was such a large number of "Macedonians" in Greece (1/10th) wouldn't be easy for them to stand up against the "Greek occupation"? "Greece acquired illegally Aegean Macedonia in 1913"Greece acquired 51% of Macedonia in 1913 as a result of the treaty of Bucharest. International treaties are not illegal. Furthermore Greece in 1913 was not a powerful country to acquire any land it desired. This land was "given" to Greece because it historically belonged to Greece and its residents were Greek. "What gives Greece the right to name another country? This issue is straightforward, every country has the right to call itself whatever it wishes."This is a misleading statement. The author knows very well why Greece is objecting to the use of the name Macedonia. In fact every country has the right to chose its own name as far as it does not belong to another country's history. The name Macedonia belongs to the Greek history. Greece has the right to protect its history and heritage. "Saints Cyril and Methdje (or Kirl and Metodi) were not Greeks but Macedonians."Saints Cyrilos and Methodios were Greeks born in Thessaloniki and this is well known to all Christians. Pope John Paul the B' in an official apostolic homily to the entire Catholic Church proclaimed that Methodius and Cyril "Greek brethren born in Thessaloniki" are consecrated as "heavenly protectors of Europe". John Paul B' repeated this statement in a speech delivered in the church of Saint Clements, in Rome. You can see the original document here. "Greece stole the Macedonian history"Greece does not 'steal' history. It has its own lengthy and respected history. It is the only thing that Greece has plenty of it. The Greek history and culture is respected by all the countries in the world. People who don't have their own history need to 'steal' someone else's... "Linguistic science has at its disposal a very limited quantity of Macedonian words. A very limited quantity in this case is a quantity indeed, that Greeks cannot ignore."This argument proves the Greek point that the "Macedonian language" was a Greek a dialect. There only exists "a limited quantity of Macedonian words" because the Macedonian dialect had "limited" differences from the Greek language. How could it be possible for a separate "ancient Macedonian language" to disappeared after what Alexander had achieved? "If Philip united and not conquered the Greeks why did Alexander leave 25.000 men of his army in Macedonia when he is about to face the strongest and most numerous army in the world?"No sensible leader would go on a quest taking ALL his army with him and leaving his homeland unprotected! And of course he did not leave 25.000 men in Macedonia because he was afraid of the other Greeks. Macedonia had lots of real enemies at its northern border (Illyrians, Dardanians,Paionians etc). "If Macedonians were Greek then why only 30% of Alexander's army were Greek?"The right question to ask is 'why as many as 30% of Alexander's army were from the rest of Greece?' After all Macedonians and Greeks were supposed to be enemies! The Macedonians 'conquered' the Greeks according to the Slavic version of the Macedonian history. The fact that a very significant part of Alexander's army were non-Macedonian Greeks shows the truth. "Ancient Macedonians did not take part in the Olympic Games"This is another false statement. It can be easily proved that people from Macedonia took part in the Olympic Games. For a list Macedonians who won the Olympic Games the click here. "Ancient Macedonians fought against Greece."This is another misleading statement. It is well known that the ancient Greek states were largely independed of each other and that often led to wars between them. Some well-known examples are the Peolloponisian was between Athens and Sparti, the Athenians quest in the island of Mitilini, the brutal war between Sparti and Thebes and many more. A war between two ancient Greek regions did not mean that one of them was not Greek. "There are no ancient monuments written in the Macedonian language because Greek archaeologists destroy them when they are recovered."Even if we accept that this is true it still doesn't explain why aren't there any monuments in the rest of Macedonia! What about the ancient monuments in FYROM and Bulgaria? What about the ancient monuments on Alexander's route in Asia? Why aren't there any "non Greek Macedonian monuments" ? Oh, I know why! The Greek archaeologists must have destroyed them as well !!! "If in fact, "Macedonia is Greece", how come they feel the need to emphasize, to shout, and to proclaim over and over again? After all, we never hear them proclaiming that 'Thebes is Greece', or 'Sparta is Greece' ". If the Salvs wanted to name heir country "Republic of Thebes" or "Republic of Sparta" who would shout out "Thebes and Sparta are Greek". But they are claiming to be Macedonians so we shout that "MACEDONIA WAS GREEK" "MACEDONIA IS GREEK" "MACEDONIA WILL BE FOREVER GREEK" If you have an argument which is not answered in this page please email us.
We see proof everywhere and almost on a daily basis that thepropaganda of the ruling class relies not only on the hired handsof lackeys (like media scum and academics), but it is also proppedup by the confusing ideologies of their self declared enemies. Thepower of the rulers lies in their skill in stuffing their slaveswith words to the point of making them the slaves of their words,Vaneigem once said. And he was right.
For the past year there has been much political debate between theGreek and (Slav) Macedonian bureacracies over the name, theconstitution and the symbols of the new Macedonian state. Twolarge nationalist demonstrations were held by the major politicalparties in Greece in order to put pressure on the EEC bureaucracyto stop backing our neighbouring nation-state's claims on the name"Macedonia". The first one took place in February 92 inThessaloniki and the second one in Athens last December. Over onemillion people took part in them (that is one in ten Greeks) andapart from the Trotskyists and some other leninists who opposedthe demonstrations, agitating for the right of (Slav) Macedonia toself-determination - a bourgeois statist concept derived fromLenin, which cost them harsh persecutions on the part of the Law -few "anti-authoritarian" groups managed to confront nationalistpropaganda, not even in theorectical terms. The majority of theso-called anti-authoritarians and anarchists, never having made aserious inquiry into the complex concrete interconnection betweenrepresentative democracy, nation-state, army and wage system,found themselves agitating for anti-militarist and,simultaneously, pro-nationalist ideas! The reason of this confusedstate of mind is to be found in the fact that people-"anti-authoritarians" being no exception - have constantlydetermined themselves and arranged their relationships in linewith the ruling ideas of their epoch; ideas of God, normality,nationality, etc.. To paraphase Marx and Gabel, the nationalistideology, which is an ideology of the ruling class, tends to buildon people's false consciousness of their actual life-process apseudo-history, which instead of explaining "Greeks" throughhistory, claims to explain history through the "Greeks". Thenationalist pseudo-historical method consists of theoreticalcrystallizations that rest on the continuous repetition offamiliar, fixed signs and on the remembrance of historical eventsinterpreted metaphysically. We need to debunk this ideology whosestarting point is a certain form of consciousness taken as aliving individual.
According to the nationalist ideology there are no autochthonousminority ethnic groups in Greece. Whenever one indignantly pointsthem out, this is what the lackeys answer back: "They are actuallyGreeks who someone, somehow, sometime converted to anotherreligion or language or they are just peasants who are behind thetimes, not yet completely intergrated into civilization." One ofthese "non-existant" ethnic groups are the Slav-Macedonians wholive (or, according to the bureaucrats supposed to live) innorthern Greece. Their politically correct name is "bilingualGreeks". According to official historiography they were among thefighters that liberated Macedonia - that "sacred place ofHellenism for over 3000 years" - from the domination of Turks andBulgarians. Contrary to what is generally believed, inventingmyths is an expensive hobby and some people, whether they like itor not, will have to foot the bill. Slav-Macedonians became "ourcompatriots" by anything but peaceful means. Even Evangelos Kofos,a foreign policy representative of the Greek state, admittedduring the sixties that the dictatorial government in 1936, forone, had adopted a policy of forced assimilation: "In a series ofadministrative measures, the Slavophones were forbidden to speaktheir Slavonic dialect in public, and deportations to the islandscarried out indiscriminantly."(1) Those "Slavophone" peasantscalled themselves Makedontsi, a word with a regional rather thannational connotation. Ethnologically speaking, they are kin tothe Slav-speakers of the former Yugoslav Macedonia.
Before being turned into a battleground for competing nationalistscum, Macedonia was just a geographical entity, part of theOttoman Empire. This ethnologically mixed region, which includedKosovo (see map 1), was mainly inhabited by Turkish and AlbanianMuslims and Orthodox Slavs, Greeks and Vlachs. According to HilmiPasha's census (1904), the Orthodox Greek speakers of Macedoniaconstituted 10% of the entire population, while in AegeanMacedonia, which nowadays is part of the Greek state, 30% of thepopulation spoke Greek, 30% were Slavic speaking, 30% were Muslimsand 10% were Vlachs, Jews, Gypsies and others.(2) It's obviousthat prior to the nationalist wars for Macedonia in the early 20thcentury, the identity of the inhabitants was determinedbyreligion, and to a lesser degree, by language.
The ecclesiastical dispute that broke out in the 1860s between theEcumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and the BulgarianExarchate was soon transformed into a nationalist confrontationbetween Greeks and Bulgarians. On the one hand, Greeknationalists, fearing that the neutral attitude of the EcumenicalPatriarchate towards nationalist disputes could not serve theirgoals, sought to Hellenize the institution of the Church inMacedonia. On the other hand, by the early 1890s a "narodnik"group, known as the IMRO (Internal Macedonian RevolutionaryOrganization) which advocated a peasant uprising against Ottomanadministrators and landowners, was founded by Slavic speakingdemocrat federalist intellectuals. According to the Articles ofthe organisation, its aim was to "bring all the discontentedelements in Macedonia and the area of the Aegean, regardless ofnationality, together in order to achieve, by means of revolution,complete political autonomy for these areas" (3). From the verybeginning IMRO was in direct opposition to the Bulgarian Churchand the most chauvinist Bulgarians in Sofia who tried to bringthem under their control.
After the Ilinden peasant uprising organized by the Slavrevolutionaries in 1903 (4), the Greek state reacted to a possibleescalation of the Slav- Macedonian uprising and to Bulgarianpropaganda. They formed numerous armed gangs and sent them toMacedonia where they cooperated with the Turkish army and thegreat land owners against the Bulgarian and Slav-Macedonian bandsas well as the poor peasants who were mostly indifferent tonationalist disputes. During the "Macedonian Struggle" (1904-08),the Bulgarian and Greek gangs tried to Hellenize to Bulgarize theChristian population violently. According to Kofos, "terrorism inMacedonia was the culmination of a quarter of a century ofconflicting nationalist propagandas in a region whose people had,more or less, no formulated national consciousness, but wereguided by the expediency of the moment and the extinct forself-preservation".(5)
We know from the memoirs of the fighters of the "MacedonianStruggle" that a certain faction of the Patriarchal clergycontributed largely to the nationalist struggles. Under duress orunder threat of ecclesiastical anathema, the Slav population waschanged from "Bulgarian" to "Greek" from one day to the next.Greek nationalist ideology found itself in more favourableconditions, since a large section of the Christian peasantpopulation of Macedonia, especially in the central and southernareas, were loyal to the Ecumenical Patriarchate, a religiousinstitution of the Byzantine and the Ottoman Empires, which,although a supranational organization, was under the control of aGreek speaking hierarchy and had never ceased to be a vehicle ofthe Greek language, which was the official language wherebyChristian ideology had been spread throughout the centuries.
Nationalist use of Christianity in Europe. It's always the sameold story! "All the members of the clergy", Mirabeau declared inthe Assembly in August 1789, "are merely officials of the state.The service of the clergy is a public function; just as theofficial and the soldier, so also the priest is a servant of thenation." Rudolf Rocker was right in regarding nationalconsciousness and national citizenship as a political confessionof faith. "National states," he wrote in 1933, "are politicalchurch organizations; the so-called national consciousness is notborn in man, but trained into him. It is a religious concept; oneis a German, a Frenchman, an Italian, just as one is a Catholic, aProtestant, or a Jew". (6)
"When the great war comes, Macedonia will become Greek orBulgarian according to who the winner is. If it is occupied byBulgarians, they will render the population into Slavs. If weoccupy it, we will Hellenize them all to Eastern Rumelia."
The fate of Macedonia was decided during the Balkan Wars(1912-1913), when the concerted efforts of the Greek, Serbian andBulgarian armies managed to end Ottoman rule in the Europeanprovinces of the Empire. Since there were no negotiationsbehorehand concerning drawing the lines of their futureterritorial settlements in Macedonia, the three powers weredetermined to grab as much territory as they could and embrace anyopportunities resulting from the military or diplomatic situation.By the end of the wars Serbia and Greece had hit the jackpot inMacedonia since Bulgaria had paid more attention to the ThracianFront where it beat the Turkish army almost completely, a factthat turned the great European powers against it.
After a series of treaties from 1913 to 1920, Bulgaria annexed 10%of the Macedonian territory, while Serbia and Greece annexed 38%and 52% respectively. The Greek state not only had the lion'sshare, occupying rural territories where no Greek speakingpopulation could be found, but it also succeeded in conquering themost advanced financial centers in Macedonia.
The compulsory exchange of the Greek speaking and Slav speakingpopulation of eastern Macedonia between Greece and Bulgaria in1920, as well as the dramatic transfer of a million, mostly Greekspeaking, Christians from Turkey to Greece and 350,000 Muslimsfrom Macedonia to Turkey, under the treaty of Lausanne in 1923,marked the final stages in the national bureaucracies' efforts toorganize ethnic-linguistic and cultural homogeneity in their newlyconstructed cages.
So the notorious Eastern Question ended, in blood and tears...Thousands of Greeks, Turks and Slavs died in the refugee shantytowns away from their native lands. Nevertheless, every cloud hasa silver lining! Those of the refugees and the soldiers who hadsurvived the wars were given full citizenship and became smallland holders or a cheap labour force. Once the nation-states inthe Balkans had, in one way or another, been formed and theagrarian reforms and the new labor markets had come intooperation, one could have supposed that from then on capitalismwould start functioning "peacefully". However, this was not true,since nationalist ambitions and lower class demands had in no waybeen satisfied. At least as far as Slav-Macedonians (or Croats)were concerned.
During the inter-war period, the Yugoslav governments (composedmainly of Serb bureaucrats) renamed their part of Macedonia toVardar Banovina and thousands of landless Serb peasants weretransfered to the region to assist in the assimilation of thenative Slavs. The official Serbo-Croat language became compulsoryin schools and public life. The situation was even worse in thepart of Macedonia under Greek occupation. The bulk of the Greekspeaking refugees were settled in Macedonia and this was a"national scheme" far more systematic than the previouslymentioned Serbian one. It is of great importance to note that,contrary to recent Greek propaganda, the Greek government of 1926declared Slav-Macedonians a distinct ethnic minority which couldhave schools in its own language. However, since Bulgariansdemanded to use the Bulgarian language and Serbs the Serbo-Croatone as the language of those schools, Greek bureaucrats startedtreating this minority as non-existant and began changing thenames of the Slav inhabitants and their villages into Greek,forbidding as we have already mentioned, any public use of theirlanguage and deporting or imprisoning hundreds of dissidents - acampaign that lasted until the late 50s. Today this assimilationprocess has almost been completed.
In Bulgaria things worked out a different way. After the BalkanWars, the IMRO militants took refuge in Bulgaria and were soontransformed into a political and financial racket supportingwhomever, from extreme right to the left, was willing to fowardtheir nationalist plans.(7)
In the early twenties, after having crushed the proletarianrevolution in Russia, the Bolsheviks began employing the Cominternas the main organ of their foreign policy. In such"underdeveloped" countries as in the Balkans, where there was nosignificant and politically organized workers' movement to beutilized, they favoured collaborations between the "communist"parties and the nationalist, allegedly national liberationmovements. IMRO was one of these movements. In 1924, the Bulgarian"communist" party entered into an alliance with IMRO in order toset the seizure of power in Bulgaria going. In a few months thealliance had broken up but the leftist faction of IMRO remainedloyal to the BCP's of a Balkan federation that would include a"united and independent Macedonia". (8)
What is important in all these political manoeuvres is that fromthe twenties onwards the Balkan leninists had become a significantvehicle for nation-building projects in the area. In the forties,Marshall Tito's stalinist party, which had beat the nazis and wonthe Yugoslav civil war leading the anti-fascist struggle of themulti-ethnic peasantry, would re-interpret the federalist ideologyof the twenties. It created a federal state and recognized,theorectically at least, the right of each of the nations ofYugoslavia to "self-determination, including the right tosecession". Besides Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina, Serbiaand Montenegro, a "state of the Macedonian people and the Albanianand objectives were to create a Macedonian republic that wouldinclude Pirin (Bulgarian) Macedonia as well as a part of GreekMacedonia and also form a South-Slav federation that would includeBulgaria and Albania under their hegemony. Stalin's conflict withTito in 1948 brought an end to such ambitious plans. The Greek andBulgarian stalinists sided with the Cominform and Tito stoppedsupporting the Greek guerillas, delivering the fatal blow to thestalinist-led rebellion in July 1949. 35.000 Slav- Macedonianpartisans were forced to emigrate from Greece and many of themtook refuge in Yugoslav Macedonia.(9)
"Political emanicipation is certainly a big step foward. It maynot be the last form of general human emancipation, but it is thelast form of human emancipation within the present world order.Needless to say, we are speaking here of real, practicalemancipation."
The new Macedonian state, whose first premier was Dimitar Vlahov,the old leader of the leftist faction of the IMRO, was thepolitical outcome of the anti-fascist and anti-imperialiststruggle of its inhabitants against Nazi/Bulgarian occupation andGreat Serb chauvinism. It was on this basis, as well as on thematerial concessions to peasants that the Macedonian bureaucracytraced a route to nation-building. The creation of the new nationwas patterned on the schemes concocted by all previous Balkanbureaucracies during the social and political struggles of thenineteenth and twentieth centuries. The new state class declaredthemselves liberators of the people, turned a regional name(Makedontsi) into a national; transformed the Slav- Macedonianidiom (on which the Bulgarian language is based as well) into a"pure" literary language, set up an autocephalous MacedonianOrthodox Church, invented a unique Macedonian history and adistinct Macedonian tradition, put foward an unredeemist ideologyof "our brothers who are still in bondage" and, here you are, anew nation in the Balkans was born in the same way that the Greek,Serbian and Bulgarian imagined communities had been created.
The nationalization of the European peoples was the main politicaland social consequence of the class struggles of the last twocenturies. These class struggles were mainly peasant strugglesagainst the landowners and the foreign conquerors and were givenvoice through the nationalist-democratic ideology, the people'sarmy and its leadership. They led up to the formation of themodern bureaucratic class which was shaped by the collaboration ofold and new rulers (politicians, democratic intellectuals,administrators, the military etc.). Their greatest preoccupationwas to organize the nationalist indoctrination of the youngergenerations, disintergrate the peasant communities and the guildsand legitimize the civil society, which was already underformation, through legal regulations; a society where a personsacrifices her/himself to the abstract notion of the citizen, i.e.the private individual, a mere member of the multitude. Thus thebureaucrats paved the way for the merchants, industrialists andthe bankers, who themselves had taken part in the socialstruggles, at least as financial supporters, and who managed toreorganize human work into "free" labour, that is, wage labour,cutting the communities into separate households, adaptable tochanges in space and time and suitable for overt exploitation.The myth of the nation, enveloped in sentiments and memories ofthe "liberation" struggles, unites these separate parts. Equalityin the heaven of the nation-state's universality counteractsinequality in the earthly, real life. The state that poses as aguardian/representative of an allegedly undifferentiated societyis the universal power that unifies the competitive privateinterests. The contradiction of the plitical nation-state lies inthe the fact that it unifies the separate parts throughseparation, since it is simultaneously the mediator thatsafeguards and guarantees the perpetuation of private interestsand the continuation of the dissociation of private and publiclife.(10)
The internationalist proletarian movement of the 19th century, theonly social movement that could put an end to the extension of thenationalist- democratic ideology, because it was seeking a real,practical emancipation beyond the present world order (11),gradually degenerated after the promising period of the FirstInternational and the federative Commune of 1871, and split intonational parliamentary "workers" parties. Those parties identifiedsocialism with the "nationalization of the means of production" aswell as the seizure of political power and led the proletariat tothe leninist-stalinist tragedy. After World War II, the secondproletarain assault on class society, culminating in the strugglesof the late sixties and strengthened by a large scale revolt ofthe middle class youth of the "developed" capitalist countries,brought the internationalist perspective to the fore again andprovoked the western bureaucrats and capitalists to actaccordingly. In the Eastern Bloc events took a dramatic course.After the events in Hungary in 1956, the stalinists could notimpede the spreading of class struggles, in other words they couldnot organize scarcity and silence effectively anymore. Thesuccessive struggles, especially those in Poland during the 70sand 80s, exposed the counter- revolutionary nature of thenon-market, industrial based variation of the Oriental despotismof the Russian empire. Besides that, the non-soviet empire as wellas the Yugoslav federation to some extent, were prison houses ofnations and various ethnic groups. The eastern proletariat beingunable to act against the bureaucrats as a class seeking for itsself-suppression, stood against the emperor as if he were a mereconqueror, that is on a national basis, hence they climbed thechariot of the nationalist-democratic ideology of their leaders(Walesa, Yeltsin, Tudjman, Milosevic...).(12) Wherever theseleaders (mostly former members of the disintergrated bureaucracyand now ambitious "national heroes" have been involved infree-for-all wars, the proletariat at worst has become cannonfodder and at best mere defenders of their lives.
There are three methods of approaching the war in the formerYugoslavia that certainly lead to false considerations of thesocial and political situation there. The first and most popularof them is dominated by humanitarian-pacifist beliefs and irassumes that the war is simply the product of evil-mindedpoliticians and thugs and rests its hope for a cease-fire on themilitary intervention of the United Nations of Amerika. The secondone is based on leninst ideology and sees the war as a struggle ofoppressed nations for "national independence". The third holdsthat behind the so-called civil war, the various nationalistfactions are serving the divergent interests of the great westernpowers. It reminds us of the one-sided estimation of RosaLuxemberg who, during the Balkan Wars and the First World War,supported the view that "Serbia itself is only a pawn in the greatgame of world politics".(13) The first method and especially thelast one are the most absurd of all since they bring out a policeconcept of history. The events in Yugoslavia cannot be understoodin terms of good or evil individual action; neither can it beexplained as the result of an external action. As far as theTrotskyist illusions are concerned, the "heroic" era of theso-called national liberation struggles has long passed. One hasto turn one's attention to the history of class antagonisms in theformer Yugoslavia after World War II.
Wedged between Western capitalist and Stalinist regimes, theYugoslav "communist" bureaucracy managed to survive thanks to itslongstanding reconciliation with the proletariat and thepeasantry. (See the law on workers' self-management in 1950 andthe re-distribution of land after the war.) The reconciliationdrew to an end in the sixties when the disputes between thecentralists, the local state officials and the enterprise managersover matters of development policy led to the 1965 economicreform. According to Neil Fernandez, the liberal-conservativestrife was "a confrontation between on the one hand rulers whostressed a degree of Croat and Slovene independence along witheconomic efficiency, and on the other hand those who wereconcerned with the preservation of the machinery of centrallydirected investment, the all-round development of national capitaland the pre-eminence of Belgrade and the largely Serbadministrative apparatus". (14) So the reforms not onlylegitimized capitalism in Yugoslavia by decentralizing investmentpolicy, reducing wages and jobs (especially in the so-called"political" factories) and liberalizing foreign trade, they alsorevealed that conflicting economic and political interests wererapidly being transformed into North-South nationalistconfrontations.
The failure of the internationalist radical wing of the Belgradestudent movement in 1968 to unite themselves with workers fightingagainst wage freezes and income inequality (15), and vice versa,and thus create continous autonomous struggles for a trulyself-managed society, was followed by a large-scale demonstrationin Pristina in November 1968 calling for Kosovo's autonomy and,most remarkably, nationalist demonstrations in Croatia in 1971-2that eventually led to the establishment of a new constitution in1974. The constitution turned Kosovo and Vojvodina intoautonomous provinces and made Yugoslavia into a confederation ofsemi-sovereign states with independent economic policy, their ownpolice force and the right to put veto on any new federal laws.
The league of "communist" bureaucrats tried to preserve theircentral unifying role as the "representatives of the workers" byreinforcing the only two all-Yugoslav institutions, the army andthe so-called workers' self-management. In the years thatfollowed, both attempts to militarize social realtions to someextent and cast the "workers' councils" for the part of areformist political party in the Yugoslavery comedy failedcompletely. By the mid 80s the technocratic leadership cadres andthe local bureaucrats had prevailed over the centralistideologues. The Yugoslav "People's" Army could not offer a bond tohold the country together because it was the armed hand of theParty and as long as the Party was rapidly disintergrating, itmerely became the armed hand of the most powerful nationalistfaction in the Party: the "Great Serb" nationalists.
The petition the Belgrade intellectuals handed the authorities inJanuary 1986 to act against the alleged "genocide" of the Serbminority in Kosovo was the kick-off for the regeneration of Serbnationalism. The constitutional changes and the Serb military rulewhich incorporated Kosovo into the body of the Serbian stategradually prompted the rest of the local bureaucracies to startmoving towards total independence. But the very root of theresurgence of nationalism is to be found in the class struggles ofthe second half of the eighties.
During 1986-9 the federal government, with the general consent ofevery local leadership, tried to totally intergrate the Yugoslaveconomy into the restructuring world capitalism. Their first move,in February 1987, under the guidlines of the IMF - their mainforeign creditor - was to cut wages and increase unemployment andwas soon followed in 1988-9 by the change of the legal frameworkof the cpaitalist relationship: the abolition ofpseudo-self-management, the liberalization of the labor market,decentralization of the banking system, etc.. The strike wave thatbroke out in early 1987 against the bureaucrats, the trade unionsand the workerist cadres in the mines and the factories of Croatiaand Serbia was astonishing and the government threatened to sendtroops and tanks against the workers. The struggle continuedwithout a break: 1623 strikes and 365,000 strikers in 2987; 1360strikes in the first 9 months of 1988. Among their demands was a100% increase in wages! The local bureaucrats were obliged to playtheir last card: nationalist ideology.
The nationalism that had already been used in previous decades toregiment social contradictions by convincing workers in onerepublic that their poverty is due to the inefficiency of theworkers and the leaders in the other republics, reached itsexplosive point in the late 80s. Social control could no longer beexerted by discredited "socialist" ideologues. A renewedlegitimation of bureaucracy and capitalism could only be achievedthrough the creation of nation-states which would manage todivide, police and recompose the proletariat on the basis of a newreconciliation between state and civil society. the leadersclearly saw that in order to maintain and extend their power theyhad to create new social cages by inventing a new form ofcitizenship, a new type of "general interest". By 1989 the massdemonstrations had already become nationalist parades. Things wereheaded the right way... And they still are... (16)
Making war against real or factitious "external enemies" is partand parcel of the making of the nation-state. The members of thewestern ruling class are well aware of this, the nationalizationof peoples in their states having been completed long ago.Professor John Mirishimer, for example, wrote in the "New YorkTimes" two months ago that the creation of homogenous states inthe former Yugoslavia calls for the mapping out of new borders andthe transfer of populations. On March 25,1991 Tudjman andMilosevic met secretly in Karadjordevo and agreed to partitionBosnia between them (17), thus forcing a non-nationalist, nonreligion-fanatical population to take sides through war. Thepartition was backed up by the great powers in London conferencein August 1992. Ethnic cleansing was carried out not only by theSerbian and Croat armies and gangs, but by UN convoys as well.They organized the evacuation of Muslim refugees from Srebrenicaand other places and the exchange of a hundred thousand prisoners.Now the Serbian army has occupied 70% of the territory of Bosniaand 20% is in Croatian possession. (see map 2) "Peace" is justgoing to bring whatever war has left incomplete to an end. (18)We can't say whether the proletarians and the peasants, regardlessof nationality, will resist all "peace makers", like they didagainst all war officers in Vukovar and during the first months ofthe war in Bosnia and whether their reactions will continue to bemainly defensive.
None of the bureaucracies of the Balkan states is out of thenationalist game. The Greek bureaucrats and capitalists thatantagonized the new Macedonian ruling class, blocking theinternational recognition of their state, trying to keep them inthe worst possible place in the new hierarchical inter-statesystem in the Balkans - even making plans to turn that formerYugoslav republic into a protectorate of theirs - have made a lotof concessions in the last months. But the results of the intensenationalist propaganda of 1992 are still largely observable. Allthe pseudo-antagonisms (left wing/right wing parties, tradeunions/bosses, etc.) have collapsed into a nationalist unitedfront against the strikers and high school students and managed,with the help of the media scum, to push their struggles out ofthe limelight. What is worse is that we saw most of our friends,comrades and people we work with fall victims of the deceptivepro-Serb Greek government propaganda. We will deal extensivelywith the very root of this despicable stance elsewhere. Moreover,the future looks bleak. When Milosevic, Greece's best ally in theBalkans, sooner or later, finds himself in need of a new war inthe south, when the oppressed Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia(see map 3) take to the streets again, the Greek proletariat,being indoctrinated for so long by racist ideas against Albanians,and their neighbours in general, will probably continue not to beable to turn against war, that is to turn against Greek leaders,who are equally responsible for all the war crimes committed up tonow as well as for those yet to come.
The failure of the workers' movement in Serbia and Greece toradically oppose nationalism and war testifies that fightingagainst the results of the hierarchical capitalist relationship isnot enough. Unless wage labourers understand that any form ofpolitical emancipation or permanent reform is impracticablenowadays, unless they understand that this war is a reactiongainst their own struggles, however modest they may be, thatnational governemnts are as one against the proletariat; andunless they start fighting for the abolition of wage labour andrepresentative democracy, the future transformation of ourcountries into local units of the EEC will surely be preceded byeven darker years of nationalism. The Balkan societies have beencaught in a dangerous trap. The bureaucrats on the one hand lookfoward to a supranational European capitalism and on the otherhand they need nationalism to regiment working class reactionsagainst austerity measures. The wage-laborers falter fromdefensive struggles to privatization, from conservatism tocontestation. These are times for the best or the worst. A realtransitory period - but to what?

Task-based language teaching is now a well-established pedagogic approach but problematic issues remain, such as whether it is appropriate for all learners and in all instructional contexts. This book draws on the author’s experience of working with teachers, together with his knowledge of relevant research and theory, to examine the key issues. It proposes flexible ways in which tasks can be designed and implemented in the language classroom to address the problems that teachers often face with task-based language teaching. It will appeal to researchers and teachers who are interested in task-based language teaching and the practical and theoretical issues involved. It will also be of interest to students and researchers working in the areas of applied linguistics, TESOL and second language acquisition.
Rod Ellis has written (yet another) agenda-setting book, this time charting a journey through key issues in task-based language teaching. This is a must-read for researchers committed to the pedagogic relevance of their work, and for language educators in search of a deeper understanding of task-based research and pedagogy.
This comprehensive yet personal book will be invaluable reading for very diverse audiences. Synthesizing a lifetime of engagement with language education and tasks, Rod Ellis proposes an options-based approach that can be flexibly adapted across geographies and masterfully re-examines the quandaries cognitive and social researchers investigate through the questions teachers ask.
Rod Ellis is Research Professor in the School of Education, Curtin University, Australia, Emeritus Distinguished Professor, University of Auckland, New Zealand and a Visiting Professor at Shanghai International Studies University. He is also an Appointed Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. He has researched and published extensively in the fields of second language acquisition, language teaching and teacher education.

These two! I don't even know where to start. We spent this whole entire engagement session cracking up.
I met up with Michelle and Chandler and we took engagement photos at a park right out side of Philadelphia. It's easy to see why they are so in love with each other because they make everyone around them fall in love as well. Not only are they absolutely beautiful but they are also charismatic and so, so hilarious.

Perfect for floor to ceiling windows and large window fronts, the MHZ panel shade is a perfect option. The system can be arranged to use a number of panels, varying widths, and lengths in order to meet the unique needs of your space and it’s architecture.
The system is comprised of an aluminum rail/guide that the panels move within. Each panel can be simply removed for cleaning or replacement. This way the system is incredibly versatile and many results can be easily achieved with the same system by only replacing panels. This functionality makes it perfect for changing to a different transparency level in different times of the year as the suns position in the sky may ultimately make some combinations less desirable during those months. This also allows simple changes to the rooms appearance with different colours or patterns.
As with all products, the panel shade is custom made to your style. An alternative use for this product is as a room partition. It is available in a large combination of colours and patterns.
The collection includes over 390 panel options, in four transparency stages with function oriented fabrics including Trevira CS, Perlex, or aluminum back side coating, or fibre glass. The panels are flame resistant and anti-microbial, suitable for humid or wet environments.
A lack of diversity among corporate IT systems allowed the virus to spread, aided by inadequate corporate policy. Guy Campos learns the lessons of Love
The I Love You bug was able to spread easily from one UK company to another because of a lack of "biodiversity" in systems, according to financial information security specialists. In nature, Darwinian natural selection has produced species that share enough genetic code to be interoperable but differ enough to vary in their susceptibility to diseases. And we should aim for similar diversity in corporate IT systems, says DK Matai, managing director of mi2g, which helps companies implement bespoke security controls.
Matai says IT managers can gain the power to shut down parts of an information network in the same way that a submarine commander can hermetically seal compartments within a vessel. Likewise, the ability to receive executable files can be restricted to members of the IT department and approved members of staff, with an IT manager acting as a gateway for other users. Executable files come in many forms, such as Word and Excel macros, but it is possible to detect hidden executables even if they are wrapped up in zip files, says Matai.
It is also possible to monitor any changes to a PC's configuration, such as a user downloading a Flash plug-in to view hot Web sites, with IT managers receiving an e-mail alert about the potential threat to data security. As with any IT investment, companies need to balance expense against the cost of failure, says Simon Owen, a senior management consultant at Arthur Andersen. And there are many companies that have yet to implement common sense controls such as putting in anti-virus scanners that are regularly updated by their suppliers.
"Companies have become so focused on speed to market that corners have been cut," says Owen. Companies can open every executable in a soundbox which tests the effect of the file before allowing it to proceed to its recipient. But this is costly, requiring an IT professional to supervise each test, and slows down communication - removing one of the prime benefits of e-mail. There has also to be a balance between technological controls and human resources policies. "It is quite clear that the Love Bug would not have spread so easily had personnel been reminded that they should delete any attachment that they were not expecting," says Matai.
The culture of sending jokes as executable attachments is rife and there is a need for the most basic education about the danger of e-mail, says Owen. Michael Chapman-Pincher, head of operations at The User Group, which advises on e-business issues, says that if employees are to take Internet security seriously a lead must come from the top. There should be a designated person responsible for security, the IT director or other senior member of staff.
Chapman-Pincher says many users still view e-mail as a novelty and open every message and attachment they get. They do not throw away unsolicited e-mail, as they would junk mail. However, he warned that attempts to restrict access to e-mail to limit the spread of viruses could make people feel excluded from the loop. Many people have huge e-mail address books because management wants to make them feel included and make it easy to communicate with anyone in the company. "But why should anyone have 1,800 names in their address book?" asked Matai.
He holds to a theory that there are four elements to e-security - not just the technological and the human but the legal and insurance aspects too.
In consultation with lawyers, companies should advise recipients of their e-mails that it is their responsibility to check for viruses. Companies can also now take out insurance policies to cover the cost of security failures. Despite repeated scares over Internet security, many users are still living in an age of innocence. "Corporate Internet access reminds me of flower power in the 1960s when people thought you could share your love with anyone," says Matai. "It was only later that people realised that there was no room for casual behaviour and so it will be with Internet security."

This rules states that by dividing your own age by two and then adding seven you can find the socially-acceptable minimum age of anyone you want to date. Take your age, subtract 7, dwting double it. So for a year old, the upper age limit would be 34 i. With some quick math, the rule provides a minimum and maximum partner age based on your actual age that, if you choose to follow it, you can use to guide your dating decisions. But how legitimate is this rule?
Does it match our scientific understanding of age-related preferences for dating? Does it always apply? How well does the rule reflect scientific evidence for age preferences? Researchers Buunk and colleagues asked men and women to identify the ages they would Eyar when evaluating someone for relationships of different levels of involvement. People reported distinct age preferences for marriage thrree a serious relationship; falling in love ; casual sex ; and sexual fantasies.
Based on the figures Buunk and colleagues Three year rule dating three year rule dating and thus the numbers are only informed approximationsI replotted their data superimposing the max and min daating ranges defined by the half-your-age-plus-7 rule. You Tgree see that men are basically rating by the rule for minimum age preferences for marital relationships blue bars and serious dating relationships yellow bars. Those age daing consistently hover around the values denoted by the rule the black line.
If anything, eule practice men are more conservative when it comes to preferred marriage, preferring a minimum age higher than the rule would say is OK. Male Participants' Minimum Preferred Partner Age as Compared to the Rule When it comes to sexual fantasies, however, men have minimum age preferences that are younger than the rule would designate appropriate. For example, this sample of year-old men report that it is acceptable to fantasize about women in their 20s, which the rule would say is unacceptable.
But fantasies, of course, are not generally subject to public scrutiny and the rule is only designed to calculate what is socially acceptable in the public eye—so this discrepancy is not necessarily a failure of the rule. For rule-related involvement e. The rule states that you can calculate maximum acceptable partner ages by subtracting seven from your own age and multiplying it by 2. The rule overestimates the perceived acceptability of men becoming involved with older women.
Instead, men report maximum acceptable partner ages that hover around their own age through their 40s. After 40, maximum age preferences for most categories remain lower than their own age. Thus the rule for maximum ages is fairly ineffective at capturing what men actually believe is acceptable. He approached the line with two other partners, but is well within the threshold in his marriage with Amal Alamuddin.
Does the rule work for women? The minimum rule half-your-age-plus-seven seems to work for men, although the maximum rule falls short, failing to reflect empirical age-related preferences. Below are the data from Buunk et al. In other words, while the rule states that year-old women can feel comfortable dating year-old men, this does not reflect the social preferences and standards of women.
Women in their 40s think that approximately 35 or older is acceptable for marriage or a relationship. Examining maximum preferences, again the rule is more lenient, offering an age range with which most people are not comfortable. The rule states that it is acceptable for year old women to date men who are up to 46 years old, but in actuality, year-old women state that their max acceptable partner age would be less than 40 around By the time of their separation inhowever, Kutcher, then 33 had crossed the minimum threshold How effective is the rule?
Curious outsiders are quick to judge when they can see a wide age gap between two romantic partners. Maybe this is why the rule is so appealing. In a world in which many social norms are often unspoken, the half-your-age-plus-7 rule concretely defines a boundary. But the rule does not map perfectly onto actual reports of what is socially acceptable.
At times it is too stringent, but most often it appears too lenient, condoning age pairings with which most people are not comfortable. So if you are following the half-your-age-plus-7 rule, know that it may not be perfect or truly mirror age-related preference. You might also take care to refer to the maximum age judiciously—the minimum age guideline seems to be more on target and more so for men than women. Age preferences for mates as related to genderown age, and involvement level.
For even, this album of year-old men report that it is relevant to record about women in my 20s, which dzting album would say is relevant. If anything, in album men are more way when it bass to preferred marriage, preferring a thinking age higher than the most would say is OK. In other great, while the natural states that year-old partners can do local dating dad-old men, this politics not reflect the conceptual preferences and stories of women. In a best in which many written cafe are often all, the black-your-age-plus-7 in concretely defines a local. Scotland Participants' Minimum Preferred Partner Age as Worked to the Most When it comes to central fantasies, however, men have home age keys that are younger than the ridiculous would designate appropriate.
And here we go again. Hello guys, happy sunday. Hope everyone is doing good? I am doing so fine and I have been having a lot of free periods lately making me so lazy.

The cost of lighting for wedding depends a lot on the type of lighting that the client is looking for as well as on the duration available. Wedding lighting can cost as much as $1950 as a low-budget estimate, but may vary depending on the service providers. In addition to that, some expert help might be necessary for operating the lighting. Technician fees can be as much as $40 per hour. Sometimes additional costs like travel fees and hotel accommodation charges might be required too if the hired professionals need to travel longer distances to offer their services.

It’s the World Cup craze and the best way to immerse yourself in this Football season is to play a brand new football management game! Introducing Champions Manager Mobasaka.
Champions Manager Mobasaka is a Football management game license by FIFpro. Players get to collect superstars such as Ronaldo, Messi, Aguero, Ozil and many more.
I haven’t played many football management games on mobile thus I can’t really compare the game to others but CMM is definitely one with great graphics. The game is mostly automated with occasional trigger events where Players have to decide whether to dribble, pass or shoot. Also, when there’s a chance at goal, Players can draw the ball path to direct your Player’s shot direction.
The biggest letdown of the game is probably the commentary. I hate to say this but it’s really terrible. I would have given this game a 10/10 if not for the monotonous and nonsensical commentary.
The game is currently available only on iOS for Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia. However, it will be opened up to more countries when the Android version is ready.

Although I'm technically on hiatus, this Letter of Note seemed a timely one to share, considering it's the 4th of July.
In October 1924 F. Scott Fitzgerald had completed the first draft of The Great Gatsby, which would eventually come to be regarded as one of the great American novels. He sent the first draft to his editor Maxwell Perkins with suggestions for alternative titles. Six months later, the novel as we know it was published.
Their correspondence (which can be viewed here) is fascinating, as we see a work of genius as it was a work-in-progress. Some of the alternative titles are interesting - On The Road to West Egg, for instance - as are Fitzgerald's comments that his potential audience must be intelligent since "the lowbrows go to the movies" (I beg to differ).
Baz Luhrmann's new adaptation of The Great Gatsby, the sixth attempt to put Fitzgerald's story on film, will be arrived in UK cinemas on Boxing Day. That gives everyone (myself included) enough time to read the damn thing, so we can show off afterwards.
P.S. Sticking with supposedly great American novels, I'll be reviewing A Place in the Sun (based on An American Tragedy) soon after I get settled.
This is a reprint of my review first published on this blog in 2014, with a number of minor revisions. You can read my original review here.
Female characters in sports films are often dealt a very poor hand. At best their narrative journey is frequently depicted as ancillary and largely complimentary to those of the male participants, and at worst they are reduced either to eye candy or to bitchily carping from the sidelines. Sports films which focus primarily on women are rare and often tackle a particular sport or discipline in a much more patronising way than if the same sport were being practised by men.
All of this makes Stick It such a refreshing piece of filmmaking. Jessica Bendinger, the writer of the cult classic Bring It On, steps behind the camera to deliver a film which rises above its more conventional aspects to give a valuable, impressive ins…
Whenever Christmas rolls around, you could bet whichever family house you’re spending it in on three films being on TV at some point:Die Hard, The Sound of Music and The Great Escape. The enduring appeal of the latter, especially in British culture, is such that it’s now hard to imagine the festive season without it, and it makes it all the more difficult for another Christmas-film-that-isn’t-specifically-Christmas-based to muscle in and claim some of that small-screen immortality. In the year 2000, however, Aardman Animations managed to pull this off. Still flush with the success of the first three Wallace and Gromit shorts, and the Oscar recognition that accompanied them, Peter Lord and Nick Park embarked on the company’s first feature-length offering. The result became the highest-grossing stop-motion film of all time, and remains extremely highly regarded i…
Things have been a little quiet on the Broadclyst Theatre Group front of late - and there's a very good reason for that. The cast of regulars and a new face or two have been working hard over the last few months to bring us two one-act plays, which are being presented in Broadclyst this Friday and Saturday (July 28th and 29th).
Aside from presenting stupendous pantomimes on an annual basis, Broadclyst Theatre Group has always had a knack for putting on cracking one act play. I grant you, I'm biased, having been in both Snow White and the Seven Dwarfsand the one-acter Two Fat Men, which won the Exmouth One Act Play Festival a few years back. But having been in and around this company for so long, I have no reason to doubt that their latest venture will continue in such a consistently rich vein (though it will be tough to topDick Whittington & His Magic Cat, which remains one of the best shows I have ever seen).
I've spoken at great length in my reviews about the questionable cinematic legacy of Saturday Night Live. The show which in its prime provided a springboard for John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd has all too often resulted in poor, one-joke affairs which have no place being on the big screen. As I stated in my review of Tammy, the number of actors (both male and female) who have successfully made the transition to a solid film career post-SNL is disappointingly small.
To some extent, we could hold Wayne's World responsible for this state of affairs. Its success at the box office opened the floodgates for the likes of Coneheads, It's Pat and Stuart Saves His Family to clutter up multiplexes on both sides of the pond at the expense of smarter, better comedies. But while those travesties are now largely forgotten in the minds of the movie-going public, Wayne…
Coming-of-age films and films about the loss of childhood innocence have often used the natural environment as a means to contrast the naivety of their protagonists with the harsh realities that they come to understand. An interesting by-product of this is that films of these sub-genres reflect the environment of the country in which they are set, and the means by which that environment is personified. In a densely populated country like Britain, films as varied as Heartless, Tyrannosaurand The Selfish Giant all take the built-up, urban environment of major cities and make them the embodiment of all that is chaotic, faceless, unpredictable, violent and, in the case of Philip Ridley's film, evil.
In America, where whole sections of the country are more sparsely populated, different parts of the country take on this characteristic. While the major cities …
This is a reprint of my review first published on this blog in November 2016, with a number of minor revisions. You can read my original review here.
We are rapidly approaching Christmas, and with it comes the usual slew of articles and listicles about the greatest Christmas films. And regardless of what film may top said lists - Whistle Down The Wind would be my personal choice - there is one thing of which you can almost be certain: Die Hard will be somewhere on those lists. In the 29 years since it first graced the silver screen, John McTiernan's tour de force has become regarded not just as one of the definitive 1980s action films, but also the definitive alternative Christmas film.
It is tempting to presume, in light of all its inferior sequels featuring an increasingly uninterested Bruce Willis, that the original has becom…
It's been a month since I last posted on here - and I think you loyal people deserve an explanation for my unannounced absence.
In essence, Aimee and I have been spending the bulk of this month moving from Yeovil into our new home in Chard. With that has come a lot of stress and very little time for watching films of any description, let alone writing about them. Couple that with the current lack of internet at our new place (at least for the next week or so), and you have the reason for my radio silence.
After the next fortnight I should be sufficiently unpacked to get back into the swing of things. You'll be getting my finished review of Chicken Run thereafter, followed by a few other reviews in hopefully quick succession. I have decided to discontinue The Goon Show Guide, which has been on hiatus for ages; it's just too hard to find the time for that and reviews. Maybe I will revive it in the future, but for now just enjoy what I've done so far and hunt down the rem…
It's easy to forget that in the so-called dark ages before the Marvel Cinematic Universe existed, comic book film franchises were not always planned out in infinitesimal detail before the first instalment had a chance to break even. The mid- to late-1990s were a dark time for superhero films, with everything from Tank Girl and The Phantom to Batman and Robin and Steel pointing to a tired genre and an increasingly spandex-weary public. In this context the success of X-Men was a pleasant surprise, with a sequel being given the go-ahead shortly after its release.
It's completely logical that Bryan Singer would want to use X2 to expand the X-Men universe on screen; with less time being needed to set up the world from the first film, there is more scope for introducing some of the more complicated elements of the X-Men mythos. But while this film does deepen the existi…
One of the most obvious characteristics of the Bond series is that each instalment of the franchise can sit on its own. Modern audiences are asked to believe that the character has been the same age for more than 50 years, and the series has bent or tinkered with its conventions ever so slightly as the decades have rolled past in order to stay relevant. While this has kept the Bond series as a whole firmly in the realms of fantasy, it has allowed individual entries in the series to push for something more gritty or realistic; if it works, it's embraced and carried forward, and if not the series reverts to type with very few tears.
Since the franchise was effectively rebooted with Casino Royale, an approach more becoming of comic books has been employed: different writers and directors come in and somehow try to stitch all the character's actions together in…
In my review ofBeverly Hills Cop II, I spoke at great length about Hollywood's tendency to demand 'more of the same' when faced with a successful film - whether that success was anticipated or not. I described it as Simpson and Bruckheimer "at their most lazy and cynical. Everything that can be recycled is recycled, so that beat for beat and plot point for plot point, there is almost nothing between the two films" - nothing, that is, unless you count Tony Scott's penchant for explosions and bare flesh.
If Beverly Hills Cop II was the most blatant (and contemptuous) example of 'more of the same' that the 1980s could offer, than Home Alone 2: Lost in New York deserves the same crown for the 1990s. The career-making success of the original film, for both its star Macaulay Culkin and its director Chris Columbus, mean…
We are rapidly approaching Christmas, and with it comes the usual slew of articles and listicles about the greatest Christmas films. And regardless of what film may top said lists - Whistle Down The Wind would be my personal choice - there is one thing of which you can almost be certain: Die Hard will be somewhere on those lists. In the 28 years since it first graced the silver screen, John McTiernan's tour de force has become regarded not just one of the definitive 1980s action films, but also the definitive alternative Christmas film.
It is tempting to presume, in light of all the inferior sequels featuring an increasingly uninterested Bruce Willis, that the original has become a victim of its own hype. We remember it as being great, not because it is great, but because everything that has tried to imitate it has paled in comparison. It is certainly true, with the benefit of hindsight, that it is not quite the best action film of the 1980s; Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade would take that crown, with Raiders and Mad Max 2 vying for second place. But it remains a really entertaining, well-assembled spectacle, with humour, bravado and efficiency to spare.
One of the little-known bits of trivia about Die Hard is that it was quite closely based on a novel. An awful lot of the structure and storyline of Robert Thorp's 1979 thriller Nothing Lasts Forever has survived in the finished film; many of the character names remain the same, the plot still revolves around terrorists attacking a corporation's headquarters at Christmas, and some of the setpieces are replicated exactly, including the sequence with the C4 in the lift.
Thorp had written Nothing Lasts Forever as a follow-up to his 1966 novel The Detective, and had hopes that any film version would star Frank Sinatra, who had played the titular character in 1968. Sinatra, who was 64 when the novel came out, declined the role despite the acclaim which the original film had received. The project was subsequently declined by Sylvester Stallone, Don Johnson, Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger (though stories of it being shaped as a sequel to Commando have been denied by co-writer Steven E. de Souza). The script was eventually retooled as a standalone and the studio took a big gamble on Bruce Willis, then best known for his work on the TV series Moonlighting.
One of the single biggest assets of Die Hard is the simplicity of its execution. While McTiernan's previous work Predator took a long time to figure out what kind of film it was, it's very easy to get into the zone with Die Hard. The good guys and bad guys are clearly defined, the action unspools at an efficient yet methodical pace, and the editing manages to keep things sharp while resisting endless fast cuts or needlessly complex camera angles. It is, as Mark Kermode once described it, "cowboys and Indians in The Towering Inferno" - a reference to the fact that Thorp's novel was originally inspired by the John Guillermin film, produced by 'the master of disaster' Irwin Allen.
In light of this, the phrase that springs to mind about Die Hard is that it "comes from a simpler time". The argument goes that it was made during the Cold War, when we knew exactly who our enemies were, and at a time before technology and digital surveillance superseded macho, hot-headed mavericks who could take down said enemies single-handed, a la James Bond or Riggs and Murtagh in Lethal Weapon. You couldn't make an old-school action film like Die Hard today, just as you couldn't make an old-school western after Unforgiven. Audiences are increasingly aware of how complex and nebulous the world and people are, and just falling back on lazy stereotypes isn't going to cut it any more.
This is an enticing line of reasoning, especially given the popularity of films like Skyfall, The Bourne Ultimatum and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, which focus on infiltration, betrayal and the system turning on itself to justify its existence. But while the argument broadly holds up, there are certain aspects of Die Hard which remain relevant, if not forward-looking. The terrorists who hold up the Nakatomi Plaza are not after political power or ethnic cleansing; they have financial motivations, foreshadowing the electronic terrorism of Goldeneye or the rise of hacking in the internet age.
The film also teases the idea of such groups using politics as a means of leverage rather than a goal in itself. Hans Gruber makes demands regarding the freedom fighters (which he only knows about because of Time magazine) to distract the authorities - a tactic that could easily be employed by contemporary terrorists, using awkward relationships between states to buy time for their own ambitions. The clash between John McClane and Gruber is to some extent one of class and culture - the earthy, street-smart, lowbrow cop against the erudite, snobbish and book-smart criminal.
One of the most common complaints made about action films, both then and now, is that they come with such poorly-written characters that the audience has nothing to connect them to the pyrotechnics. Characters in such films are often written so closely to an archetype - the hero, the villain, the love interest and so on - that they lack distinctive personality traits, and with it the ability to behave in an empathetic, idiosyncratic manner. Die Hard may be structured as a straightforward fight between good and evil, but the characters feel three-dimensional, with flaws and foibles which keep them memorable and make the film all the more rewarding on repeat viewing.
German film critic Philipp Bühler said, very accurately, that McClane works as a character not because of his strengths, but because he is vulnerable. Writing in Movies of the 80s, he said: "He's scared of flying, and he's scared of a world that no longer has a place for men like him... What distinguished him from human tanks like Schwarzenegger and Stallone was his sensitivity and vulnerability, which helped make Die Hard an action movie for people who don't generally like action movies." I said in my review of Red 2 that Willis often betrays in his performances how much he really wants to be in a given film. Here, his performance is disciplined, responsive and very convincing, and besides Twelve Monkeys it remains his finest hour.
Alan Rickman's career-making performance as Gruber is a similar indication of the quality of the script. Rickman's villainous turns often get lumped together in such a way that they have become a pastiche of the archetype, but there is a world of difference between Gruber and the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. The Sheriff is nothing more than an over-the-top, pantomime bad guy, whose hilariously drawn-out death throes give Nordberg's calamities in Naked Gun a run for their money. Even when he's bellowing "where are my detonators?!", Gruber is a more complex, guarded and reptilian beast, who teeters between funny and terrifying thanks to a script which gives the character sufficient scope to explore motivations and pressure points in depth.
As far as its spectacle is concerned, Die Hard still holds up extremely well thanks to its use of physical effects. The set used for the Nakatomi Plaza was at the time the headquarters of 20th Century Fox, with several scenes being shot on floors which were still under construction. Not only did this give McTiernan the power to wreck things as he saw fit (captured by Paul Verhoeven's cinematographer-of-choice Jan de Bont), it also brings an organic sense of entropy to proceedings which CGI cannot match. The injuries McClane sustains are mirrored by the growing destruction of property, and all the setpieces connect and flow beautifully.
For all its good points, Die Hard does have a couple of flaws which somewhat tarnish its glowing reputation. Roger Ebert, who did not like the film, made a valid point about the role of the police as the action unfolds. The stupidity of Al's boss, and by extension the journalists and FBI, serve as a distraction from the central conflict and undermine the script's hard work on making the central characters relatable. Al himself is likeable enough, but he's still an unnecessary concession to generic convention, and the resolution of his arc is far too neat.
The other flaw with Die Hard is its ending. McClane's fight with Karl has such a fitting climax that to bring him back seemingly from the dead for one last jump-scare moment is cheap and unnecessary. After that, the film winds down into standard, American yuletide schmaltz; having held off for so long, it suddenly remembers that it's Christmas and gives us a jarring, sentimental ending, rather than saying true to the novel and letting McClane die. We forgive the film of these fumbles because of how good it has been up until then, but it's still a shame to finish things off so illogically.
Die Hard remains one of the must-see films of the 1980s, being an action film with brains and heart rather than just brawn. Willis is excellent in the role which made him a star, ably supported by Rickman, and it remains as entertaining on the first watch as it does on the 50th. Aside from a few niggling flaws, it is both an easy film to relax into and a must-see for anyone interested in Hollywood cinema. Whatever happens to John McClane in the future, this will always be the gold standard.

House of Commons Hansard #41 of the 39th Parliament, 2nd Session. (The original version is on Parliament's site.) The word of the day was human.
Mr. Speaker, this will not make anybody safer. That is part of the issue. This is not going to make Canada safer.
On the minister saying earlier that releasing criminals across the country would not be considered acceptable, I agree with him. It would not, but I ask, please, for it to be proven that someone is a criminal. We cannot say that we are not going to release criminals across the country but also say that we cannot prove someone is a criminal, so we are just going to hold that person as long as we possibly can or send him or her back to be tortured or potentially to continue terrorist activities in his or her own country.
Not only will Canada not be safer, but as well, our justice system will not be made safer by this kind of legislation, which does not--I repeat does not--uphold the basic tenets of our justice system around the ability for full answer and defence.
At this point, we do not support the bill that will be presented. I believe her party is also against it. Furthermore, I would have liked to have 20 minutes to explain why we are against this bill, instead of only 10 minutes. I do not understand this procedure.
Assuming that the arguments we present here could eventually convince other members, if people vote against the amendment after each clause, what would be the point of holding a debate on the bill itself? I must admit I do not understand this notion at all, unless of course it is some sort of filibuster.
Mr. Speaker, this is not intended at all to be a filibuster. It is intended to show that the NDP, as we have said all along, is opposed to this bill. We did not make amendments at committee stage because that would have been trying to fix what we consider to be a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation.
This was our way of demonstrating and saying to the people of Canada that we cannot support any piece of this legislation and that we do not have an amendment to bring forward to tinker with it, to try to change part of it, or to do any of that. The Chair chose to group the amendments from one to twelve. This is the only way that we saw for being able to do this.
Mr. Speaker, this is obviously a very important piece of legislation. I want to say at the outset that were we in government in response to the position expressed by the court, we would have definitely presented a different piece of legislation.
This is a piece of legislation that during the committee we have tried to actually improve partly or fully because we believe that the court deadline is very important, and the issue of national and public security is very important for the country. In a way, it is a non-partisan issue. It goes beyond political partisanship.
The fact is that this security certificate regime has been in existence since 1977. The court obviously had the opportunity to review this matter and review it in the context of the Charkaoui case and provide us with its judgment.
The fact is that the government could have chosen any of the three or four models, that the court looked at, without expressing approval for any one of those models.
In fact, one of the models the government could have actually adopted, as I said earlier when I spoke to this matter, was the SIRC model, the Security Intelligence Review Committee model, where there was much fuller disclosure available, where SIRC actually set up an adversarial process, and where SIRC was able to set up essentially a courtroom type procedure to deal with these issues and deal with the security issues prior to the security certificate regime coming into being.
The other particular model that the court referred to was the process under the Canada Evidence Act which handles the balance between the protection of sensitive information and the procedural rights of individuals. The Attorney General of Canada of course has a role with respect to that matter about the potential disclosure of important national security information.
Then in fact the court looked at the Arar case, where the commissioner devised a process to deal with sensitive information in a way that as much disclosure as was possible could be provided to Mr. Arar and/or his counsel.
Finally, the court also examined the special advocate regime that is presently in existence in the United Kingdom. It has been criticized in the United Kingdom. It is a scheme that even if the government wanted to bring this scheme into our legislation, it could have been improved much more than it actually attempted to.
I want to say briefly that our committees, both of the Senate and the House, had made several recommendations to deal with the anti-terrorism legislation. Some of those recommendations were directed to the security certificate regime. Both of the reports of the committees found that there was a need for some form of adversarial challenge to the governmental claims that the secrecy was necessary. Both committees concluded that the affected party be entitled to select a special advocate from a roster of security cleared counsels who would be funded by the government but independent of government.
It should also be noted that both reports also provided several other recommendations for changes to be made to this particular legislation beyond just the issue of how to achieve the correct balance. One of the issues that they had dealt with was the faster process and dealing with the issue of the torture evidence.
When we looked at this legislation and looked at it in light of the fact that there was a court imposed deadline and we needed to proceed expeditiously to deal with the issue, we felt that there were some areas of the legislation we could at least quickly improve upon.
The Liberal members on the select standing committee were able to make four amendments. Let me just go through those amendments. They are very significant because they deal with the rights of the detainee with respect to these matters and enhancing the rights of the detainee.
First, we were able to actually specify in the legislation, through the amendment, that there ought to be specific criteria for the minister when creating the roster of potential special advocates to ensure that they are duly qualified, that they are independent, and that they have adequate resources, which means that they are funded by the government in an adequate fashion but they are independent of the government.
Second, we were able to make an amendment to the effect that the detainee, foreign national or permanent residence, who is the subject of the hearing, be allowed to choose his or her own special advocate from the roster and that advocate in cases would be appointed by the judge.
Third, and in fact very important, there was the absence of the solicitor-client relationship altogether in the legislation, and we were able to reinstate the solicitor-client privilege for the detainee to the extent of the information that the detainee may have given to the special advocate, so the special advocate is barred from sharing that information with anybody else other than the detainee himself. Therefore, that provides a degree of solicitor-client privilege which we believe was appropriate in the circumstances.
Fourth, and most important of all, we were actually able to successfully make a very broad amendment that dealt with the issue of evidence that may be the product of torture, whether it is the primary evidence or derivative evidence. Based on the amendment, if the judge that might be hearing the case believes, on reasonable grounds, that the evidence may be the product of torture, directly or indirectly, that evidence would not admissible in the proceedings before the judge with respect to the particular detainee.
I believe that we have been able to make improvements. Let me just go back and recap, and say that if we were the government, this would not be the piece of legislation. The government could have done a much better job. The government could have actually adopted and built upon the homegrown concept and the process that the SIRC model uses. It did not do that. That would have been much better.
Therefore, we will be monitoring this. We will be attempting to make as many changes or improvements as possible over the next number of months and years, but it is important that the legislation pass. We have a deadline upon us and that is the deadline of February 23. It is important that we show some degree of responsibility, so that the court deadline that has been imposed upon us does not go by. We want to have a system in place before that happens.
Mr. Speaker, I do not know if the member saw a news report in the Ottawa Citizen earlier this week, a story about how the government is having difficulty finding lawyers who are willing to act as special advocates, who are even willing to apply for the position. Apparently, so far only 50 have responded to the month-long recruitment campaign.
There were reasons given for that by two very prominent legal experts. Lorne Waldman, a very prominent immigration lawyer, actually an expert on the special advocacy process, said, “Given the nature of what the lawyers are being asked to do, it does not surprise me that there has not been an overwhelming response”. He further went on to say that the system “fundamentally abrogates” the right of the accused to know the evidence against them. He points out very serious problems.
Vanessa Gruben, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, also says that she thinks that the low number of applications for special advocate positions may stem from concerns about the proposed security certificate legislation.
There are concerns among the legal community that the model proposed in Bill C-3 falls short of the constitutional standards set by the Supreme Court. That is also supported by the Canadian Bar Association and the Federation of Law Societies in Canada.
Mr. Speaker, let me first thank Lorne Waldman. I believe it was his evidence and that of others like him that enabled all of us to make the improvements that we were actually able to make to this legislation. I want to publicly thank him and others for making the contributions they did.
On the question of the shortage of applicants, I do not know whether the number 50 means that there is a shortage of applicants with respect to the role of special advocate. Everyone knows that the special advocates have to be in the vicinity of Ottawa or Toronto, mostly for these matters. Everyone that knows the requisites in this particular case, knows that one needs to be experienced in areas of constitutional, immigration and criminal law.
There are very few lawyers in this country who are equally familiar with all those three areas of law. Therefore, I think there could be a shortage of applications for that reason.
Also, I was talking to a very learned Queen's counsel in British Columbia the other day and he told me that in British Columbia they are finding it hard to find senior counsel who can do ad hoc criminal work, prosecutions. That tells me that lawyers are not necessarily going into certain areas of specialization as they ought to, in numbers as they used to.
Mr. Speaker, I realize that we as parliamentarians sometimes have a series of objectives in our society that we have to maintain and sometimes these objectives can be in conflict with one or another, whether it is security and human rights. As citizens it is true to say that we have as much right to be protected by the state as from the state.
The security certificate decision that was taken by the Supreme Court in September 2007 was a very important decision. The court at that time had serious concerns with the security certificates in this country and there was not an adversarial role that was taking place in the process.
The decision came in February 2007, yet the government waited until October 2007 before tabling anything in the House. I find that very lamentable that it took so long to do that. It did not give Parliament sufficient time to deal with this very important issue.
I regret to have to cut off the hon. member for Davenport, but I do have to allow enough time for the hon. member for Vancouver South to answer the question.
Mr. Speaker, the member is saying that he did not ask the question, but I understood the thrust of his remarks.
Those are very important issues he raised, but as parliamentarians, as members of the government and members of the responsible opposition, we have to sometimes work with haste expeditiously to meet the deadlines that may have been imposed by the court. We must also try to create as appropriate a balance between individual rights and national security, as are possible under the circumstances. This is not the most ideal piece of legislation and is not what I would have done, but we need to move with some haste.
Mr. Speaker, the security certificates we are talking about are misnamed. As a result, most people have difficulty understanding what they are. They are actually deportation orders, whereby a sovereign nation exercises its right to refuse to admit foreigners who are deemed to represent threats to national security.
When security certificates are used only when people arrive in Canada, as was done in the summer, far fewer problems arise. Security certificates are always issued against foreigners and cannot be issued against Canadians, for the simple reason that section 6 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides that any Canadian has the right to enter, remain in and leave Canada. Consequently, this sort of procedure cannot be used against Canadian citizens.
There is a separate procedure for Canadian citizens who are deemed to be dangerous even though they have not committed any crime. In my opinion, many people believe the government could use the same procedure against foreigners, but that is neither here nor there. This law has been in existence for some time, and we cannot say it has been abused. Although it has been invoked 27 times, it has been used only five times since September 11, 2001.
A security certificate creates a real problem when it is issued against someone who has entered Canada, has been a permanent resident for many years, has started a family, has had children and, after spending considerable time in Canada, suddenly wants to become a Canadian citizen. Just when he qualifies to become a Canadian citizen and applies for citizenship, the government issues a security certificate against him.
That is what happened to Adil Charkaoui. He came to Canada in 1995 with his parents and, I believe, the person he married here. He had children. A security certificate was not issued against him until 2003.
When the security certificate applies to someone who can return to his country of origin, there is no real problem. We can accept the fact that a sovereign nation is simply exercising its right to refuse to admit someone if it considers that person dangerous. A problem arises when the person will face torture and perhaps even death if he is returned to his country of origin. That is why this person does not want to go back.
The government often defends these measures by saying that the person is in a three-walled prison. One wall is missing, so all the person has to do is leave. For some people, the fourth wall of their prison is actually a cliff. Leaving would mean certain death or torture. This is where serious problems arise. How long will we hold this person?
We must understand what a security certificate is based on. If ministers intervene, it is because the security agencies believe, based on the information they have, which is usually confidential, that this person is a risk. Why do they not reveal this information? There are three reasons. First, because the information was obtained from a country on the condition that it not be made public. It is also because the information comes from secret agents who have infiltrated terrorist organizations. Revealing the source of the information could mean a death sentence for these secret agents. The last reason is that, in the fight against terrorism, which is much more important that the fight against crime, if we were to reveal investigation methods, such as how the information was obtained, the terrorist organizations would have a leg up on our defences. I think these reasons are understandable.
Consequently, after the ministers have signed the security certificate, which is in effect a request for the court to authorize a removal order, the reasons must nevertheless be submitted to the judge—proof that we are a civilized country. He must be given the real reasons or sufficient reasons demonstrating that the decision is not being taken lightly. He must be presented with the facts and the methods and these cannot be revealed to the person in question. That creates a legal problem that is extremely difficult to resolve.
After reading the decisions of the Supreme Court, I was personally convinced. Given the significance of the risks related to terrorism today, I recognize that such procedures must exist to a point, especially procedures used in such an exceptional manner.
However, we do not agree with the government on the measure to be used. It never stops repeating that we must balance—and it is a fine principle—security and the respect for rights. That goes without saying. However, the Supreme Court, which is examining this issue, realizes that the individual involved cannot know all the reasons why they are suspected, in fact, very often, most of them.
I found that Mr. Charkaoui was quite convinced and sincere when he said that he did not know why a security certificate had been issued against him. He had some suspicions because they asked him to be a double agent and he refused. I understand why a father would refuse to be a double agent, especially since he told them that it was not true that he knew terrorists, that perhaps he knew them without knowing that they were terrorists and that, in any case, he did not want to get involved.
It is nevertheless very difficult to make a decision about someone in such a case because the final consequences are exactly the same as for the most serious criminals in Canada. In terms of seriousness, it is the second most severe type of sanction imposed on criminals that we have in Canada. The most severe sanction is life imprisonment. In that case conditional release is a possibility. The other most serious sanction is indefinite detention.
A number of conditions had to be fulfilled before making that kind of decision. Improvements had to be made in accordance with the Supreme Court's recommendation to the government. This government still believes that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Supreme Court decisions set limits that cannot be exceeded. The government is very proud of the fact that it abided by a Supreme Court decision. It seems to me that if the government had reviewed the Supreme Court's reasons for amending the legislation, it would have noticed that it should be doing a little more than what the court suggested, and that it is not up to the court to come up with the system.
I was prepared to talk about this for 20 minutes. The brilliant procedure proposed by the NDP would allow me to speak 12 times for 10 minutes, plus 20 minutes. However, at some point I still would have wanted to put together the reasons that we are likely to support. I will probably have a chance to come back to this.
In closing, we believe that when making a decision as serious as this one—upholding a security certificate—the judge must be certain that the person represents a real risk.
Then they decided to give the person the right to appeal, but it was not really a right to appeal. It was something that allowed judges to discuss issues that could be raised during a hearing. That is not a real right to appeal. I would prefer to give that person the same right to appeal that dangerous offenders get under section 159 of the Criminal Code, that is, a real right to appeal on questions of fact, of law or of fact and law.
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for his intervention in the debate. His comments are always very helpful and very well informed, given his great experience.
Yesterday, the families of the five post-9/11 security certificate detainees gathered here on the Hill, Mohammad Mahjoub's wife, Mona El Fouli, Adil Charkaoui's mother, Latifa Charkaoui, and Mahmoud Jaballah's son, Ahmad Jaballah. A representative of Sophie and Mohamed Harkat, Christian Legeais, also attended. As well, we remembered Hassan Almrei, who is the only person still detained at the Kingston Immigration Holding Centre on a security certificate.
One of the pleas that the families made was to ask that MPs and senators not support this legislation because of their great concerns about the injustice that it does. Ms. Charkaoui, Adil Charkaoui's mother, said that she did not believe there was a place in Canada for a justice system that involved “justice à deux vitesse”, I believe that was the expression she used, two systems of justice, one for Canadians and one for permanent residents or visitors to Canada. She believed that we should be proud of our justice system in Canada and that everyone here should have access to that system.
I wonder if the member could respond to Latifa Charkaoui's concerns about what she believes this security system represents.
Mr. Speaker, if we want to talk about these issues in a strict, legal sense, we have to include nuances that are not always understood.
First, like many people, Ms. Charkaoui probably does not realize that this is not a criminal trial procedure, since the person involved has not been charged with anything. In fact, the first decision made about this person was not to incarcerate him, but to expel him. A citizen cannot be expelled unless it is a matter under extradition law, if he is being sought by the country where he allegedly committed a crime.
This is a process related to immigration law, which enforces the principle by which a sovereign country has the right to refuse entry to foreigners it considers dangerous.
I would have liked to have seen legislation that made concrete improvements, but I cannot propose amendments to change the legislation in that way.
I would like to take this opportunity to say that if the minister were truly serious in asking for a non-partisan attitude toward this matter, he should have talked to us, and we would have—
I am sorry to interrupt the honourable member for Marc-Aurèle-Fortin. I believe there are other questions and comments.
Mr. Speaker, I have worked with the member before. When we had witnesses before committee, as he knows, they came with some excellent suggestions for improving the bill. Not only that, members around the table tried to put in amendments to this bill.
The public needs to understand why some of these very good suggestions could not be incorporated into the bill at this point in time, because of the stage it was at when it came to the committee. I remember that the member had an amendment that was ruled out of order. I would like the member to go over some of the activity that occurred to try to improve this bill, but which improvements could not be incorporated because of the way in which the government chose to send the bill to committee.
Mr. Speaker, in my view, the opposition parties—at least two of them—took their work very seriously in addressing this question. I am convinced that this power must exist somewhere, but the balance has been shifted.
Moreover, we managed to get some amendments adopted. For instance, the person in question can choose his or her counsel from the approved list of lawyers. There was a clear amendment that states that the counsel is bound by solicitor-client privilege. We would have liked to go even further, yet we were held back: the bill, as it stands, provides that it would have to be the most ignorant of counsel. One can sense, once again, that the government was reluctant to fully cooperate, with a view to ensure there were enough members at the meeting to restore the balance. It is unfortunate.
In particular, it would have required provisions to make a distinction between the decision to be made when someone has just entered the country and the decision to be made in the case of a father who has been living here for years, whose parents have received citizenship and whose children were born here and have Canadian citizenship. I do not see why such a person should not be treated like a Canadian citizen.
Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to speak to Bill C-3, the government's response to the Supreme Court decision with respect to security certificates and also the government's response to the Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security and the subcommittee that reviewed this aspect.
Getting the balance right between the civil liberties of citizens and the duty to protect citizens from criminals and terrorists is never easy.
I must say, in Bill C-3, the legislation we are debating today, I believe the government has made an attempt to achieve that balance. The government has paid attention to the work of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security and the subcommittee on the Review of the Anti-terrorism Act.
Recommendations of the subcommittee relating to the use of special advocate for processes other than security certificates, that is the listing of terrorist entities, the deregistration of registered charities and denial of charitable status, and applications for the disclosure of information under the Canada Evidence Act are still under study by the government. The government has, however, incorporated the subcommittee's recommendation to employ special advocates counsel for the security certificate process.
Security certificates are not a post-9/11 product. They have been around for more than 30 years. They are an instrument used very sparingly. Only 28 security certificates have been issued since 1991 and only 6 since September 11, 2001. Nineteen individuals have been removed from Canada as a result of security certificates. They are used to remove from Canada foreign nationals or permanent residents, not Canadian citizens, who are deemed to be security risks to Canadians. Individuals detained under security certificates may leave Canada at any time. Admittedly it is not always possible to find a jurisdiction that will accept these people or locate a jurisdiction that will not torture or cause them harm once they arrive. However, there have been many successful removals.
The subcommittee of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security reviewed the anti-terrorism legislation, which was required after five years that it was brought into play. The committee decided to include a review of security certificates even though they were not a feature of the anti-terrorism legislation. They are instruments administered by Citizenship and Immigration Canada.
I had the honour to work on this committee and participated in the review of the anti-terrorism legislation. Testimony from witnesses completed in the 38th Parliament before it was dissolved. Therefore, we had witnesses in the 38th Parliament and that testimony was regurgitated or brought back before the new Parliament. The subcommittee and the standing committee issued an interim report in October 2006 and a final report in March 2007 in the 39th Parliament.
The interim report had to be released to deal with the provisions of preventive arrest and investigative hearing contained in the Anti-terrorism Act. These provisions had been sunsetted and were about to expire.
For example, the individual about to be detained is informed of what they are accused of. What they are not told is the sources of information employed by the Canadian authorities (CSIS, RCMP etc.) to convince a judge that the person constituted a threat to the security of Canada.
Persons detained, as I said earlier, may also leave Canada at any time. This can be problematic, admittedly, for some individuals for some countries. However, there are examples of people returning to their countries and not being persecuted.
The security certificates process has been challenged in the courts in Canada and had been affirmed as not violating the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, on February 23, 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada pronounced that the security certificates process was inconsistent with the requirements of the charter.
The Supreme Court concluded that these provisions of the act that allowed for the use of in camera, ex parte proceedings from which the named person and his or counsel were excluded violated the right to life, liberty and security of a person under section 7 of the charter.
The court found that the right to a fair hearing included the right to a hearing before an independent and impartial judge who decided the case on the facts and the law, the right to know the case that had to be met and the right to meet that case. Since evidence heard in camera and ex parte could not be tested by the named person and could not be disclosed by a judicially authorized summary of that evidence, the provisions of the act violated section 7 of the charter, the right to liberty.
The court also concluded that the provisions could not be saved by section 1 of the charter as being demonstrably justified limitations necessary in a free and democratic society. The Supreme Court gave Parliament one year to replace and reform the relevant provisions of the act.
The court made reference to the existence of special counsel, special advocate or amicus curiae measures used in Canada and in the United Kingdom where there was a requirement to protect sensitive information while still recognizing the right of individuals to meet the case with which they were confronted.
With respect to security certificates, our committee recommended changes to the process in our March 2007 final report. We recommended the use of security cleared special advocate counsel for the security certificate process, but also for the listing of terrorist entities under the Criminal Code, the deregistration of registered charities and denial of charitable status to applicants under the Charities Registration (Security Information) Act, and applications for the disclosure of information under the Canada Evidence Act.
These three processes all have star chamber characteristics, in my judgment and in the judgment of the committee, and we recommended changes to improve the transparency and fairness of these processes. In Bill C-3 the government has accepted the recommendation to create special advocates to deal with security certificates.
With respect to the use of special advocates for processes other than security certificates, the ones I have just mentioned, the government, in its response to the subcommittee's report this summer, seemed to be lukewarm. The government's comment was as follows:
At the present time, the Government believes that further study of the use of special advocates in other processes is required.
I am hoping that the various government portfolios are still reviewing that and I would like to see some action on that in the future or a wholesome and fulsome response.
It would appear that changes to these other processes are not reflected in Bill C-3 and hopefully they will come later. These processes have the same in camera, star chamber qualities, in my judgment.
The subcommittee of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security had other recommendations on the topic of security certificates. One of these was as follows:
The Subcommittee recommended that sections 79, 81, 112, and other provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act be amended so as to allow for an application to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration for protection only after a security certificate has been found by a Federal Court judge to be reasonable.
In its response to the House of Commons report, the government responded this past summer to this recommendation as follows. The government stated that it agreed “with the stated objective of making the process more expeditious and will examine methods to do so”.
Bill C-3 eliminates the suspension of consideration of the reasonableness of a security certificate that occurs when a person named in it makes an application for protection. In addition, Bill C-3 requires that a judge of the Federal Court must commence a review of the detention within 48 hours.
With these two provisions, the government has responded to the recommendation of the sub-committee on this matter. This improves the sequencing of the process such that people will not be seeking protection from being sent to a country where they would be at risk until a Federal Court has determined whether or not the security certificate is reasonable.
The Subcommittee recommends that section 78(j) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act be amended by adding the words “reliable and” before the word “appropriate”.
The government has incorporated this wording into section 83(1)(h) of Bill C-3. In my view this provides greater certainty that evidence presented to a judge, if obtained by torture, will be inadmissible. Our party at committee introduced amendments to make that even more clear. I am glad to say that the government supported that amendment as well.
Bill C-3 addresses the key concerns of the Supreme Court of Canada and the report of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Public Safety and National Security. For these reasons, I believe Bill C-3 deserves the support of the House.
Mr. Speaker, in spite of the changes to the act with which the official opposition is pleased, does the member think there will be enough financial resources for the special advocate to not only do administrative work, but further investigative work if it is necessary? Will the special advocate have the kind of freedom to information that he would want to see available if he were in the position?
Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Surrey North for her hard work on the sub-committee and the committee on this matter.
This matter was raised and discussed in committee. There was some concern that not only did the special advocates need the sort of rum and ration type of support, but they needed to be able to do all the research and have the resources available as well so they could act and respond in a timely way. The government responded, not unreasonably, that the matters could not be built right into the legislation. We looked at the wording at the time and some improvements perhaps were made to make it more clear.
All of us in the House and all Canadians and people who are interested in this legislation will be watching, I am sure, as the government brings in the regulations to support the special advocate process. That will begin to spell out more clearly how this will work. The next stage will be the estimates and the budget building process to see what actual resources are made available. If they are not sufficient, the House, or the committee or both should flag that and take it on with the government.
Mr. Speaker, most Canadians would be stunned to hear that people have been incarcerated in Canada for periods as long as five to seven years on evidence that potentially was obtained through torture. The bill as it stands now has been amended so that evidence obtained by torture cannot be used.
We also know that evidence is provided by countries from the Middle East, developing countries and third world countries that do not have the same standards of evidence that we have here in Canada and other democracies. What guarantees do we have that evidence from countries that have different standards than ours in terms of evidence, that people will not be incarcerated as a result of that type of evidence?
Second, we also know that many of these countries are not democracies, they are dictatorships. People often seek refuge from those countries because they are political opponents to those dictatorships and seek refuge in countries such ours, Canada. We have a tradition of providing refuge.
We also know that some of those countries are quite adept at forging documentation and have in the past taken out personal vendettas against their political opponents who have escaped their grasp. What guarantees do we have--
I apologize to the hon. member, but I do need to give the hon. member for Etobicoke North adequate time.
Mr. Speaker, I know that in the hon. member's riding, he has a large population of Muslim Canadians, as do I. In fact, I think my riding has the third largest population of Muslims in Canada.
Some of the Muslims in my riding are not very happy with my stance on these particular issues. However, I can tell the House that the mainstream Muslim community that represents the vast majority of Muslims in Canada, I believe, have told me the reason they came to Canada was to escape the kind of intolerant societies, the risk to their personal lives, the corruption and the violence that goes on in those countries. They want a country that is safe for them and their children.
I am not suggesting they would all agree with Bill C-3, and we on the Liberal side are not suggesting that the bill is perfect. However, in response to threats to Canada, I think it is a reasonable solution. Ultimately, it could be challenged in the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court will decide.
Mr. Speaker, the bill was introduced following a decision handed down by the Supreme Court in February 2007, which stated that the procedure for the judicial approval of security certificates established by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and, furthermore, that it was of no force or effect. First of all, I have serious doubts about five particular provisions of Bill C-3.
First of all, arrest without warrant is a serious concern to us. As we know, a warrant can be obtained very quickly if sufficient evidence is presented to a judge. Why is this not the case here?
Second, are security certificates really necessary? Yes, they are, in very exceptional cases. They should only be upheld if the individual is considered dangerous beyond any reasonable doubt. However, with this bill, reasonable doubt is sufficient grounds for the continuing detention of a permanent resident or foreign national subject to a security certificate.
My third concern is whether it is acceptable for the term of incarceration to be indefinite. People are sent to prison but not told how long they will be there, and that evidence is being gathered. Deadlines keep getting pushed back. We are worried about the fact that people can be detained indefinitely. The mere fact that indefinite detention is possible for subjects of security certificates seems extreme to us.
For how long can a society that claims to abide by the rule of law keep people locked up with no evidence that they have committed a crime? It makes no sense that in a free and democratic society, people can be detained without ever having been found guilty following a trial.
My fourth point is that special advocates are not given access to all of the evidence. We think it is important for a special advocate bound by solicitor-client privilege to have access to all of the evidence. Currently, they may be given only a summary of the evidence, but we think they should receive the evidence in its entirety. We think it is important for advocates to be able to defend the rights of an individual facing deportation.
The people involved should be able to select security-cleared advocates from the Minister of Justice's list. Is it not logical to ensure that special advocates have the resources they need to do their jobs? Special advocates should also be allowed to see their clients more than once so they can get additional information once they have received the evidence.
My fifth point is that, clearly, appeal procedures have to change.An appeal will only be allowed if the judge, having heard the government's and the special advocate's representations, upholds the order for removal or incarceration. If the individual cannot be deported, there can only be an appeal on a question of law or general interest raised by the judge. For the individual concerned, it is not very reassuring to know that the person confirming the deportation is the same one who drafted the notice of appeal.
I do not understand why the government went so far. A similar burden does not exist elsewhere in the law, at least not in our law. I still have a number of very serious reservations about Bill C-3.
I would like to ask a question. I do not believe that the Canadian public really understands what a security certificate is all about. I would like my colleague to confirm one thing.
For example, my in-laws live in the United States; they are American. In theory, if they were to come to Canada and if they were suspected of wrongdoing, they could be arrested and put in jail without being given a reason and without having access to a lawyer. Is that true? Are security certificates a threat to us?
Security certificates cannot be issued against Canadian citizens. However, they could be a threat to any visitor or anyone who has permanent residency but not citizenship, so any individual who was granted permanent residency by the government.
Any foreign national, any visitor or any individual living in or visiting Canada could be incarcerated with no access to a lawyer and without being told what evidence exists, if a security certificate was issued against this individual on our territory.

These are two very important elements when you first start. It’s best to learn before you start to earn. Paid channel marketing is something you’ve probably come across in some form or another. Other names for this topic include Search Engine Marketing (SEM), online advertising, or pay-per-click (PPC) marketing. Very often, marketers use these terms interchangeably to describe the same concept — traffic purchased through online ads. Marketers frequently shy away from this technique because it costs money. This perspective will put you at a significant disadvantage. It’s not uncommon for companies to run PPC campaigns with uncapped budgets. Why? Because you should be generating an ROI anyway.

Sources frequently target highly specific, well-defined receivers. For example, after extending the late-night hours of many of its locations, McDonald's needed to get the word out. It targeted shift workers and travelers with digital ads, because the company knew that these people made up a large segment of its late night business. McDonald's encouraged them to download a new Restaurant Finder app, targeting them with ads placed at ATMs and gas stations, as well as on websites that it new its customers frequented at night. © Copyright 2018 Milestone Inc.

Halloween seems like it’s ages away, specially if we consider that Netflix won’t release season 2 of Stranger Things until that day.
So we can all agree that we are desperate to know what happens next, right? Will we see more monsters? Is Eleven hanging out in the forest? Is Will still vomiting creepy slugs? Let’s find out…
Sure, we got to see a bit of it towards the end, but the Duffer Brothers, creators of the show, have hinted at the Upside Down’s return, and we can expect to see more of it and its secrets.
Season 2 has plenty of new additions, but the ones that we like the most are siblings Max and Billy, who will stir things up at Hawkins, and Sean Astin, the unforgettable Mickey from The Goonies and Samwise from The Lord of the Rings, who will play Joyce’s new boyfriend. We can already picture Hopper’s reaction…
During the first season, Noah Schnapp (Will) and Joe Keery (Steve) were credited as recurring characters, but this next season sees them as series regulars, so we are in for more of Will re-adjusting to his pre-Upside Down life and Steve perfecting his hair.
Did you even doubt? Millie Bobby Brown has obviously confirmed it, and while Eleven seemed to meet her end at the season finale, we all know whom Chief Hopper was leaving food for. Also, the last episode is called The Lost Brother. Does this mean we will get to meet Eleven’s mysterious brother? Let’s hope so.
Yes, because she died and nobody except Nancy gave a shit. But don’t worry, because as Matt Duffer said recently, “We’ll make sure there’s some justice for Barb. People get very frustrated, understandably, that the town doesn’t seem to be really dealing with Barb. That stuff is all happening.”

FORMER SENATOR Bob Bennet (R-Utah) will return to Washington as a lobbyist, ending what he calls a “let's-punish-politicians-for-being-politicians” cool-off period. The Examiner’s Tim Carney shared a few words on Bennet's appeal to the first amendment for the right to lobby.
A petition to deport CNN's Piers Morgan “for attacking [the] 2nd amendment,” made the White House petition page, and has since (as of this posting) garnered over 82,000 signatures. A less successful counter-petition aims to keep Morgan in the U.S., partly “to see how loads of angry Americans react.”

In this one, Frank is asked “what grade do you give yourself? 1-10?” His reply: “I give myself a 10 for being smart enough not to answer that question.”
According to The Atlantic, lobbyists should expect incoming Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), who is replacing the late Daniel Inoyue, “…to be a consistent liberal in a reliably Democratic state. He supported a 2009 bill to legalize civil unions that was vetoed by then-Gov. Linda Lingle. In keeping with his work in saving beaches, he's also emphasized environmental concerns and served on energy- and environment-related committees in the Hawaii House.”
Looming over all of this is the fiscal cliff. The Wall Street Journal's fiscal cliff graphics page makes an otherwise tiresome and complicated subject intelligible. (Also see the Nov. 30 LobbyBlog).

The author first became interested in researching the Mormon Church when he was given a copy of the “Book of Mormon” and was told that it had been translated from some golden plates that God had given to twenty-one year old Joseph Smith in the early eighteen hundreds in New England. According to the story, Smith had translated this book by using a seer stone that God had provided him along with the golden plates. The book which Smith had “translated” was a story about Nephi, an Israelite, who with his father and mother and other family members, from an ancient tribe from Israel, traveled to America about 600 years B. C. After they arrived in America, this tribe built cities and developed an advanced civilization.
After several years, according to Smith’s account, the ancient tribe was split into two groups, one called the Nephites and the other called the Lamanites. The Nephites were the God-favored group and endeavored to please God through their worship and clean living. The Lamanites on the other hand were enemies of the Nephites, who often lived in primitive dwellings and huts in the mountains and forests. The Nephites and Lamanites were constantly at war and suffered many deaths and casualties. At times the Nephites were victorious in these wars, and at other times, the Lamanites were the victors. Finally a great battle between these two opposing groups took place and the Nephites were defeated and annihilated with the exception of one survivor called Moroni.
Moroni was the son of one of the great leaders of the Nephites, and was given the task of protecting the historical records of the Nephites. He did this with help from God by burying these records on golden plates on a hill near Palmyra, New York. Joseph Smith, when a boy of fourteen, was told of these records by the angel Moroni and finally at the age of twenty-one was led to the golden plates which contained the seer stone needed to translate them.
The author could not accept the concept that a church claiming a membership of eleven million members and having a corporate worth estimated to be more than fifty billion dollars is using as its basis the highly improbable story of Smith’s “Book of Mormon.” Because the author believed that the story was unlikely he decided to investigate the “Book of Mormon” and the Mormon religion. This book relates the findings of the investigation that resulted in the author’s conclusion that Smith’s book is fraudulent and the Mormon religion which claims Smith’s book as its basis is also untrue. The church has distributed millions of copies of the “Book of Mormon” in many languages to all corners of the earth. And millions of copies of the book are kept in storage for future distribution by missionaries, members and by direct mail from central church warehouses. Various types of public media are used in advertising to encourage the public world-wide to request a free copy of this book.
Much of the evidence that discredits the authenticity of Smith’s “Book of Mormon” is discussed in the first chapter of this book and reinforced in later chapters. Smith’s contention that the American Indian descended from immigrants of ancient Israel is proven to be false by the DNA (genetic code of cells that have lived) study that compares American Indians DNA with people from Israel and from the Asiatic countries of Mongolia and China. This DNA study of over 2,000 Indians shows that their lineages were closely related to people from Southern Siberia near Mongolia in Asia and not from Israel. Another study at Brigham Young University of 3,000 Indians from Peru, also concluded that virtually all these Indians’ ancestors came from Asia. Those who did not relate to Asian ancestry, related to European ancestry, most likely Spain.
Smith’s “Book of Mormon” story contains much information about “the ancient Israeli immigration” which has proven to be false by DNA studies. Since this story and others, found to be false by the author, are still maintained to be true by Mormon Church teachings, and the church has great financial resources and an extensive missionary network to promote and expand this religion that may threaten free and independent life styles and our democracy, American citizens have a duty and responsibility to monitor this religion as well as to research its honesty and truthfulness. The author feels that we cannot sit idly by while these great resources are being utilized through a vast television and human resources network that is constantly at work with slick public relations and carefully-planned missionary programs to expand its membership. The Mormon Church is using all available means to increase its membership by obtaining converts and encouraging members to raise large families for the purpose of increasing its power and influence in the world.
Authority, power and influence are key factors of the Mormon movement. Joseph Smith’s reign as President and Prophet of the church from 1830 to 1844 created the basis for the authority, power and influence of the church leadership. This was strengthened and expanded by Brigham Young in his thirty-year reign from 1847 to 1877. In their forty-four year leadership of the church, Smith and Young held iron-fisted control of their congregations, not just over religious activities, but of their lives outside the church as well. In all possible ways, Smith and Young used dictatorial methods to control the church. Their dictatorial power was accomplished by maintaining that their authority came directly from God.
Several books have been researched and quotes from them have been used to reinforce and document the conclusions reached in this book. Especially notable among these excellent books are Janice Hutchinson’s “The Mormon Missionaries,” Fawn Brodie’s “No Man Knows My History,” Sonia Johnson’s “From Housewife To Heretic,” Deborah Laake’s “Secret Ceremonies,” Latayne Colvett Scott’s “Mormon Mirage,” and D. Michael Quinn’s “The Mormon Hierarchy, Extensions of Power.” Thanks to the charity of the authors of these books and their publishers, the author was able to employ some of their thoughts into this manuscript. Both Sonia Johnson and Fawn Brodie have special book collections at the University of Utah Library. To underscore the respect that scholars have for the classic work of Brodie’s “No Man Know’s My History,” that was first published in 1945, a symposium was held in Salt Lake City in 1995 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of this great work.
In spite of the numerous attempts by Mormon Church writers to belittle, condemn and discredit Brodie’s book, it has withstood all criticisms and remains not only a classic, but the most credible biography of Joseph Smith not only when it was published in 1945, but to this present day. Laake’s book of which more than 500,000 copies were printed in 1993, rose to number eight on the best seller list and remained there for fifteen weeks.
Many of the authors of references used in this book have completed their works at great risk to their employment, as well as being able to remain in the good graces and respect within their Mormon communities. (The Mormon community is a closed society, and those who are not members of the church are not generally included in social and community activities sponsored by the church. Non-Mormons who are prospective converts to the church are temporarily embraced by the Mormon community, but when they do not join the church, they are excluded from the closed society.) In spite of these risks, these authors have striven to present their conclusions and research findings concerning the Mormon Church honestly and without restraint. Some of these authors, who have left the Mormon Church, were forced to leave their families behind since family members were so indoctrinated in church teachings that they refused to accept any findings, though true, that conflict with church instruction. There are numerous instances of ex-Mormons who decided that the church was wrong in its teachings, had their names removed from church rolls and found later that their businesses were boycotted and they were socially discriminated against by the Mormon community. Some of these ex-Mormon stories are summarized in this book.
Practices and beliefs of the church historically and of today are presented that the author believes reveal the fraudulent nature of the Mormon Church’s teachings. The close control that the Mormon Church has upon the social, economic, psychological and political life of church members is also discussed.
The author was dismayed at what he had learned about the church and felt an obligation to put down in writing these concerns, especially since they contrasted sharply with his understanding of freedom of thought, individualism, democracy and independence. Intensive reading and research brought about the discovery by the author that the history of the church was fraught with deception, authoritarian rule and leadership and was conspiratorial. Numerous deceptions and conspiracies were discovered that took place in the fourteen-year reign of Joseph Smith and the thirty-year reign of Brigham Young. The author discovered that these deceptions and conspiracies have continued to the present day. This is exemplified by a review of the Hofmann forgeries cover-up in the 1970’s and 1980’s and the continued propagandizing by the current Mormon Church hierarchy in other matters. The author believes that the Mormon Church hierarchy is well aware of the value of its propagandizing program to enhance its image and to expand its influence. Recent efforts have been made by the church to purchase additional radio stations (in the Chicago area) and newspapers. The most controversial attempt to expand its media control was the negotiations to control “The Salt Lake Tribune.” “The Salt Lake Tribune” (established in the 1870s) has been independent of church control and has been a competitor of the church-controlled Utah newspaper, “Deseret News.” The “Tribune” in the year 2000, carried a series of embarrassing articles about the Mormon Church’s involvement in the 1857 Mountain Meadows Massacre of 120 innocent members of the Fancher wagon train, and many see this as an attempt by the church to throttle the “Tribune” by buying it.
It is not necessary for the author to review the commendable aspects of the Mormon religion, since great resources of the church are used to extol the virtues and desirable practices of the church. However, in the opinion of the author, the commendable aspects of the Mormon religion are outweighed by the undesirable aspects as outlined in this book. Numerous spot advertisements appear on television promoting the family and encouraging viewers to obtain a free copy of a video tape and to request a free copy of the “Book of Mormon.” If you want to learn more about the church, they will happily trot over two young “missionaries”, usually nineteen to twenty years old, who will “explain” what the church is all about. Billions of dollars are spent every year to propagandize the church not only to their own members, but to prospective members as well. Therefore, the author feels obligated to present the documentation that he feels reveals the fraud and dishonesty that the church’s vast propaganda machine dispenses as well as its real threat to democracy and freedom in America and throughout the world.

When applying for a mortgage, you will most likely be presented with the option to pay points to lower your interest rate. In order to determine if this investment is worthwhile for you, you will need to know the amount of your loan, the interest rate before the purchase of points, and the interest rate after the purchase of points. You will also need to know the length of the loan and your savings rate.
If you are taking out a $250,000.00 loan with an interest rate of 5.000%, you might be able to buy down the interest rate to 4.500% with points. If you are getting a 30 year loan and paying for your points, your monthly payment (principal and interest only) will change from $1,342.05 to $1,266.71. This will give you a savings of $75.34.
But, if you put your money in the fund with an average savings rate of 5.000% rather than purchasing points to cut an interest rate of your mortgage loan, you might get $10.42 per month from your investment. When you figure in your investment savings, your true savings will be $64.92 per month.
After considering the cost of paying for the points, you will break even after 3 years and 3 months.

FC Nordsjælland midfielder Godsway Donyoh has set his sights on a great start to the season ahead of their Danish Super League opener against Esbjerg FB on Sunday.
The Wild Tigers will commence their top flight campaign when they welcome newly promoted side Esbjerg FB to the Right to Dream Park.
The Farum-based outfit will be hoping to replicate last season's league performance - where they lost only three of the 18 matches played at the Right to Dream Park, qualifying for the UEFA Europa League qualifying spot after finishing 3rd on the standings.
In an interview with the club's official mouthpiece, Donyoh urged his team-mates to begin the campaign with a positive result at their stomping ground on Sunday.
Donyoh is one of three Ghanaian players named in the side's squad for the clash against Esbjerg FB - after Clinton Antwi and former Ghana U17 ace Ibrahim Sadiq.
Chairman of the Ghana League Clubs Association of Ghana (GHALCA), Kudjoe Fianoo, has admitted that the football fraternity in the country had been a great disappointment to the fans of the local game after several revelations in the Anas Aremeyaw Anas expose on corruption in the domain.
The expose, which was premiered at the Accra International Conference Centre on Wednesday, shed light on how match officials such as referees and match commissioners and officials of the National Sports Authority and the Ghana Football Association were involved in alleged acts of corruption.
Speaking on Citi TV’s The Point of View programme on Wednesday after the premiere, Fianoo expressed his sadness at the development and said that football fans had been handed the short end of the stick in terms of value-for-money.
“We must be the first to admit that we have let Ghanaians down. It’s sad that someone will struggle to get money to go and watch a match, only for an individual to decide the results.
Several reactions have followed the public viewing of the expose but the main theme of most thoughts have bordered on reforms and cleaning the football association.
Fianoo agrees with that line of action and has charged club owners and officials to be at the forefront of the rebirth of the Ghana Football Association.
“GHALCA has the capacity to salvage what’s left of football in Ghana. The investors must find the time to come together to do this.
It took the junior officers of the military to do house cleaning on June 4, 1979. It’s now time for us to make sure that the corrupt people get out of the football industry.”
GFA officials such as its president, Kwesi Nyantakyi, Greater Accra Regional FA boss, Eddie Doku, Eastern Regional FA boss, A. A. Lawal and referees like Samuel Sukah and Reginald Lathbridge were seen in the expose using their positions to engage in alleged acts of corruption.

Training in Spain is cconsidered prestigious and the quality ofthe data. In the ranking of most attractive countries for education, the country occupies the third place, slightly behind the UK and Ireland.
Education in Spain in recent years has become especially popular among students from Russia and Eastern Europe.
Pre-school education presented the kindergartens and preparatory groups. Pre-schools in the country is not mandatory, but is popular. In the gardens children are raised to three years. At this stage special attention is paid to their acclimatization and adaptation in the peer group.
Teachers teach them to interact, to communicate, to Express themselves and build relationships. In the preparatory group of children to teach the basics of reading, writing, arithmetic. Mandatory children are taught music, drawing, systematically engaged in physical culture.
With this practice, many first graders in Spain are unable to read fluently, to write and superficially know at least one foreign language.
Vienna University of technology with a loud, but concise slogan “Technology for the people!” is doomed to success among students from different countries.
The main problem of preschool education in Spain is insufficient number of places in kindergartens. Because of such statistics began to appear illegal establishments, which the government is fighting more than one year. In a particularly prestigious gardens there are reserved seats in colleges for graduates.
Basic or secondary education in Spain is compulsory. Until recently, children at this stage could choose what program will be taught: classical (for the subsequent admission to the UNIVERSITY) or simplified (for subsequent employment in the field of workers). Currently, the program has unified and standardized, so that all students initially receive the same amount of knowledge.
With 8 years in Spain, children learn foreign languages. For teaching in schools invite native speakers, and in the process of learning the methodology of individual interviews and group discussions, games. Often in Spain studying as a foreign English or French.
Austria is a land of beautiful views and clean air, but also one of the best countries in Europe in terms of obtaining higher education.
In fourth grade, students begin to take exams after the completion of each academic quarter. If a student cannot cope with the exam tests, leave it for the second year. Knowledge control at all stages of school education in the spotlight. After graduating from high school, graduates receive a certificate.
This part of the educational process is not mandatory, but the program Bachillerato need to learn for those who are planning to enroll in higher educational institution. Essentially, this is high school. Bachillerato often based in areas of traditional schools.
Not all schools have the opportunity to teach on a full list of these areas. Therefore, some high school graduates are forced to change their place of learning at this stage. The program Bachillerato mandatory enter philosophy, religion, ethics. Also the course is entered by two subjects from the specific specialization of the University.
The circuit University in Brno was founded in 1919 and is a leading higher education institution in Moravia.
In public institutions the training programme is offered on a free basis. After completion of the course shall be final comprehensive examinations, which is both the entrance to the UNIVERSITY. The more points obtained in this exam, the more prestigious the institution may enroll a graduate.
Despite the fact that education in this country is open to new techniques and modern ways of teaching, institutions of higher education may be solely to universities. Depending on the intensity of the training program and its profile, we distinguish the following types of Spanish universities:
Higher education institutions in Spain operate on a fee basis regardless of the form of ownership. Besides state and private universities in the country are seminaries that are under the care of the Church. In the Universities the training is in full-time and correspondence, as well as popular distance learning.
Australia is a unique and amazing continent that makes an indelible impression on almost all travellers.

In Spain you can get high-quality and modern European education. In the national education system cultivated the technique of early development that enables you to quickly get used to the large amount of information and reasoned analysis. Entrance examinations in Universities is quite difficult and foreign students to pass them is not easy, so requires careful preparation.
If price is the most important piece of evidence in identifying opportunities, then risk management is the most important part of taking advantage of those opportunities. From a risk management perspective, technical analysis is ideal for identifying when any trade thesis is wrong. Knowing when you’re wrong or knowing when to exit is crucial to successful trading. We don’t care about being right. We care about being on the right side of the trade. Technical analysis allows us to do that on a consistent basis.
Technical analysis allows us to identify logical entry and exit points to maximize gains and limit loss. Every time we enter into a trade, we must have an exit plan – both for locking in gains and stopping any losses. Too often, investors will enter into a trade without a game plan. That is, without targets and stop losses. This is like entering an unknown and crowded room without identifying any exits or escape routes. Not wise. At 360 Investment Research, we try to identify the most logical entry and exit points before entering any trade. For each investor, entry and exit points will vary based on risk tolerance and individual styles and preferences. Regardless of the aforementioned, all traders, including you, should know exactly when your current trade is wrong. We don’t want to get into a psychological game of chicken with the investment of choice. If/then game planning allows us to remove emotion from the trading process and eliminate as much bias as possible. How do we this? Some examples of setting up if/then scenarios can be found in two great trades we shared with our readers this year: Nike (NKE) and Russia (RSX).
For another example of game planning and risk management, we can look at the current state of the S&P 500. We like to use ETFs to capture markets, sectors, or segments. In this case, we’re long the S&P 500 using the ETF, SPY, as our vehicle. As we’ve previously highlighted in parts 1-5 of this series, we’re seeing some negative evidence appear that is causing us to watch price (the most important piece of evidence) very closely. So we’re long the S&P 500 with some warning signs that need to resolve. What’s our game plan? Where is our exit (which can also be an entry going short)? Let’s take a look. The chart below is of SPY. As you can see, price has been steadily making higher highs and higher lows within the green upward channel. The exceptions being lower lows in February and October, which were subsequently countered with new higher highs. So the trend is up and we are long this market. What will it take to change our long stance? Simple. Breakdowns below previous areas of likely demand (aka previous highs) and below the green price channel. As annotated on the chart, our game plan is to change from long to short (using SH) with a daily close below 204.00. This is our if/then line. We are long above it, short below it. If price moves below 204.00, we would add to our short position with a close below 200.00. Each of the shaded areas and the lower green trend line would be logical places to reassess what price is doing and either add to our short position or change back to long. At each of those levels, we’ll analyze price and make adjustments as needed. With risk management, no game plan is static. We continually reassess our game plan to minimize loss and maximize gain. This game plan is not for everyone. We’re not saying going short is right for you. But, cash is a position too. And for right now, the lines in the sand are pretty clear.
That was quick. Last week, our technical analysis pointed to a good probability of higher prices in NKE after identifying an ascending triangle on a weekly time frame. Maybe you got stopped out at 79.50. Or, maybe you enjoyed the 10% gain! One of the first questions I got from individuals who saw this analysis and subsequent gain was… Why? What happened? My answer: does it matter? Does the 10% gain not count if we don’t know exactly why. You see, every ounce of our body is programmed to ask this question. It could be curiosity. It could be our rebellious nature. We want to know why. In investing, this desire to know why is looming in the deep recesses of our analytical minds. But guess what? We cannot know everything. Do you want to know why NKE went to $89? Because that is what it’s worth. Price is the final arbiter of value. Why is NKE worth $89? Because enough money believes such that it created demand that outstripped supply to the tune of $89/share. That’s really what happened. Sure, fundamentalists will point to earnings. Ok, that’s fine. But how many times have you seen great earnings and see the price drop? That’s right. It happens a lot. Could it be that price forecast the earnings would be that good? Absolutely. We can think what we think, but we must trade what we see. What did we see? That the likelihood of higher prices in NKE were pretty good. Now what? Move your stops up to $84.50 (which is equal to 50% of this original move).
If you benefited from this information, you’re welcome. Share the wealth. Share 360 Investment Research with your friends. Trade safe, curious investor.
Filed Under: Breakout, Equity, Pattern Recognition, Supply and Demand Tagged With: Ascending Triangle, measured move, Nike, NKE
Nike has broken through overhead resistance to new highs on weekly and daily time frames. The move comes after the fourth knock on the 79-80 door. Corrections take place in one of two ways – through price (declines) or through time (sideways price consolidation). This bullish continuation pattern in NKE is a classic ascending triangle, meaning that price formed this pattern during a period of consolidation within an uptrend. In an ascending triangle, one trendline is drawn horizontally at a level that has historically prevented the price from heading higher (for NKE, 79-80), while the second trendline connects a series of increasing troughs (marked with a “360 green” line). What’s great about patterns is that our risk and rewards are well defined. In this case, our reward target is 96ish, a 17% gain. And we can choose one of two stop loss levels to manage risk – either 79.50 (below previous weekly resistance now turned support) or tighter at 80.75 (the ideal support level on a daily basis)
We have our entry (right now), our stop loss, and our target. We don’t enter a trade without an exit plan. So we have our game plan and will enter this trade because of the robust risk/reward opportunity. If we get stopped out, we don’t care. That means our risk management is solid. We’ve removed the emotion while identifying great potential gains. You’re welcome.

I was about ten years old sitting on the couch watching Saturday morning cartoons when the unmistakable lope of a Chevy V8 chugged towards our house. It wasn’t as loud as my dad’s Chevy C/K pickup with the 402 cu in V8 and a ‘special’ cam, but it sounded racy, so I jumped up and headed to the front screen door for a look.
It was a Nova; it might have been my age, and it had its nose lowered; its rear raised. It reminded me of Speed Buggy right before he took off fast. Like Speed Buggy the front tires were smaller, and the rears fat with an inch or so of tire sticking out of the rear fenders and as the car drove past they proved to be at least twice as wide as stock.
“Nah; the front that low it won’t steer for beans and that rake with its ass in the air you can’t see out the back. Look how wide those tires are. They had to cut the trunk out to get them under there.”
The Nova continued chugging and rumbling down the street, so dad grabbed a piece of paper and a pencil and drew me a sketch to explain how they had ‘ruined’ it. He explained how suspension worked and all about camber and caster. How lowering the front of a car that much ‘pinned’ its ears and wouldn’t let you turn the wheel to full lock before the tires would rub on the inner or outer edge making the car ridiculous to turn around, made even more difficult by the ‘rake’ where the back was so much higher than the front. Dad had done some racing in his time, both drag racing and late model oval stuff; back when late model still looked street legal. Dad went on to explain a balanced suspension and weight distribution in the details a ten year old could barely understand. I think his point was either to convince me engineers were geniuses whose work shouldn’t be fooled with, or overwhelm me with technical jargon so I wouldn’t want to become a mechanic like him.
The problem with dads plan though was we still went to car shows, which back then, were mostly custom hotrods; and therefore by dads own characterizations; ruined. Then at one show in Chicago I met George Barris. If you don’t know about Mr. Barris, go check your car enthusiast card; I think it may have expired. The Batmobile, Munsters hotrod, and the Monkeys mobile were some of the most iconic custom cars ever made. Dads terminology of ‘ruined’ suddenly lost most of its authority.
After decades of going to auto shows of all types I’ve gained an appreciation of all things auto. There are many cars that I would say; ‘That’s not the way I would have done it.’ Or ‘That’s not the car I would have spent all that money on.’ But sometimes you have champagne dreams and a beer budget. Sometimes life gets in the way and the project car stays a half built daily driver. I try to appreciate everyone’s car as a work of art or a work in progress, and I try to see it from their perspective and allow them to build it their way, on their budget.
This week is SEMA week. (Specialty Equipment Market Association) Anyone who is anyone in the automotive aftermarket auto parts, fabrication, or modifying business is in Las Vegas to show off how much you can ruin a car and the products to do it with.
I love the idea of SEMA, but in recent years it’s become a proliferation of one builder trying to out build the others and in so doing I feel like they are forgetting the guy who works in his garage with jack stands and his own tools. Many of the SEMA projects are commissioned and have sponsored parts that make the finished project just as unattainable as the car that guy with the jack stands dreams about.
Today I provide a collection of photos from car shows I’ve seen. Some of these cars are literally priceless works of art. Some others are the kind of car you make if you don’t chase after the prom queen and just dance with the girl you brought. In this era of “Rocket Bunny all the things!” that SEMA seems to have become; where is that fine line between an Automotive van Gogh created masterpiece where form is the function; and a ‘Not so much’ Bro-Bro No-No?
I bought one for work and while the car is good and fairly fast (JDM NA SW20 produced around 170hp instead of 130hp in the US), that car is quite sketchy around or over the limit... I didn’t get that feeling with the much more powerful (and LSD equipped) Revision 2 Turbo SW20 but that NA Rev1... hum... Not sure what to think of it. I know many people who’d crash it in a heartbeat hahaha
A while back I mentioned a group of us was going to do a ::deep breath:: Top Gear Style cheap car epic overland road trip. ::exhale:: What that really means is we flew to Sacramento, bought cars and fixed them up for less than $3,000 each, and then drove a lazy arch through national parks and BLM land, sticking to back roads and offroad trails as much as possible. I plan on wiring a full write up, same as I did last time, in the following months, but for now I want to introduce the cars.
Unbeknownst to us, Taylor arrived two days earlier to buy a car. He works remote, so he could do this with little impact to his work schedule. Bastard. His goal was to poach one of the cars we were looking at as a bit of a joke, with the intent to sell it to one of us if we got offended. It was a pretty good plan.
Taylor and I were essentially looking for the same car: manual SUV with a real transfer case. I had pretty well laid claim to the Izusu Rodeo market as I’ve always wanted one, but we were both looking at Pathfinders, XTerras, Amigos, Troopers, etc.
Taylor actually had a bitch of a time finding a car. While he only test drove two, he went to see at least seven. They had various problems like bad brakes, awol owners, “creative” paperwork, and bad transmissions.
He did look at my #1, a two-grand Trooper that looked SWEET. Not sure why he didn’t drive it. If he had, he could have saved me the time and heartbreak. More on that later.
With time dwindling, he finally got a bite. A red 4Runner that he had been trying to see for three days suddenly became available. Taylor was supposed to be picking up one of the others of our group, Charlie, at the airport, but luck for him Charlie’s plane was delayed such he got in at the same time as George and I.
When we all pulled into the AirBnB, Taylor was waiting in the driveway in front of a red 1995 Toyota 4Runner SR5, 5-speed, with keys in one hand and a bourbon in the other. We were confused, alarmed, surprised, elated, enraged, and ecstatic… all at the same time. What a wonderful game he’d played! More importantly, we didn’t have to worry about buying him a car tomorrow, which made buying the other two easier!
As Taylor tells it, after the test drive the seller immediately knocked $500 off his $3500 asking price and a confused Taylor just accepted. He hadn’t anticipated being able to get that much off. Both parties left happy with the deal.
The next morning Taylor and I set off in the 4Runner and Charlie and George in the rental chariot (a 2017 Chevy Tahoe, surprisingly terrible) to go buy the remaining two cars.
Taylor and I headed off to some suburb or another to look at my most promising lead a regrettably automatic but otherwise clean Rodeo. When we got there, we laughed our asses off at the other thing in the driveway: a 1992 VW Cabriolet. (If you’ll recall, George bought a 1991 for the last trip.)
Visual inspection of the Rodeo revealed it’d been sitting for a bit as it was stuck to the ground with spider webs. Still, it fired right up and the AC worked a treat. I actually really liked it! It pulled well in the low end, despite being autotragic, and in general was a pretty sweet car. EXCEPT… the 4WD wasn’t working. Sadly, haven’t forgotten to bring my OBDII scanner and the seller wanting too much money for the car, we quickly noped out and headed back to view the Trooper Taylor had passed on.
We arrived right as the dealer was opening (but accidentally before he had actually opened) and took a look. Luckily, the car was unlocked so we got to go over it and found no reason to pass. When the dealer, confused, arrived he handed us the keys and sent us out on a test drive. That… didn’t go well. To this day I don’t know what was wrong with it, but when pulling away from a stop at any level of throttle produced a violent shaking and juddering until the transmission slammed into 2nd, at which point all was well.
Next up was another Rodeo listed at midnight the night before. When we arrived, the dealer had already started the car (a bad sign) and it was ready for our test drive. Only problem was while “4x4” was plastered all over the listing, this thing was cleared 2WD. The dealer tried to convince me it was AWD, but it wasn’t. It just wasn’t.
After parting ways with that dealer, I had the stupid idea to call him back over and ask “got anything else with 4WD?” He did! A F250 diesel. Sadly it wasn’t going to be “ready for sale” for a few days. Pass. He also had a Land Rover. Ok, any port in a storm. How much? “Three grand.”
Turns out it was a 2001 Land Rover Discovery II SE7. Leather everywhere, power everything, dual automatic climate control… this thing was awesome! A test drive revealed no major problems. Engine was great, AC was cold, and the transmission was buttery. Holy fucking shit balls I was going to buy this car.
After getting back to the AirBnB we decided to park the Land Rover around the corner as a surprise for the others. Because you know… who could be that much of an idiot?!
While all this was unfolding, George and Charlie were on the hunt. His first stop was a dealer that had a 1996 Grand Cherokee Limited that had seen better days. That said, the price was right. He went and took a look, but everything was wrong with this car. The headliner was missing, the 4WD status panel was dead, the trip computer was dead, the interior was from at least three different cars, the lift gate cylinders were shot and it hadn’t been started in at least a month. It was a trash can. Still, it did OK on the test drive and the AC worked well, but he decided to pass.
After that was another dealer with a lifted Grand Cherokee. This one was in way better shape… until he test drove it. This was an experience that he described as “terrifying.” Apparently even for a Jeep the handling was wayward due to the shitty lift, and he got to experience for the first time what he now knows well: Death wobble.
So we have a high mileage 4Runner, a Land Rover, and a beater Jeep to complete an 1800 mile offroad road trip.
Humans love to complain. There must be something in our nature that makes us this way, because we’re always looking for something to share with our friends and family, and good experiences just aren’t as juicy or exciting. This is true when it comes to personal relationships, politics, and interactions with companies.
Did a viral video ever surface as the result of someone having a lovely, on-time flight with nice flight attendants and good airplane food? Nope. That would be wonderful if it ever happened, but it’s not very likely.
Especially in America, we expect good service and reliable products, so we aren’t likely to praise a company to our friends and family unless we have an exceptional experience. But if we have just one bad experience, everyone in our social circles is likely to hear about it.
In fact, one study done by Dimensional Research found that people who have a bad experience with a company are 50% more likely to share it on social media than people who have a good experience, and they are 52% more likely to share it on an online review site like Yelp.
For businesses, this means that great customer service is more important than ever before. It also means that bad hires who interact with customers, either directly or indirectly, can be devastating to your business. It only takes one bad interaction to ruin a customer relationship, and that interaction can spread like wildfire if it is egregious enough.
Better hiring decisions lead to happier employees; a more supportive, productive environment; and ultimately better customer interactions. People who are engaged with their work and who get along with the people they report to and work alongside will bring a more positive, can-do attitude into the workplace, which always leads to better customer service.
Mistakes will still happen – they can’t be erased entirely – but prompt and diligent responses by good employees can lead to some of the best reviews of all. Personally, I’m most impressed not when everything goes smoothly, but when people react with care and speed when things go wrong. That’s the mark of good employees; the kind of employees who prompt positive reviews and a stronger business reputation.
Finding such employees isn’t easy, but it can be greatly facilitated by assessments for hiring. Hiring assessments help hiring managers look past basic qualifications to talent, character, motivation, and potential for growth.

If you are a parent, I’m sure you remember bringing your baby home from the hospital. If you are like my wife and I, we had a mix of emotions ranging from incredible joy to sheer terror. Here is this tiny person, yelling at the top of his lungs and we have no idea why. Is he hungry? Is he thirsty? Is he in pain? Is he uncomfortable? So we pull out the baby books, with their non specific advice and generalities. Questions like should we let him cry? When will he finally go to sleep? How do we keep from doing psychological damage to him? These were all just a couple of questions that we had.
Ages zero through two is the first group we will address, and it is also Erikson’s first stage of development. Erikson calls this stage trust vs. mistrust. Trust as defined by Erikson is “an essential truthfulness of others as well as a fundamental sense of one’s own trustworthiness.” We have all been there, but I doubt if any of us remember much about our lives in this age group. Although we may not remember trauma’s or unmet physical needs, if the conditions are met, we may have developed our first maladaptive schema from an event that we may not remember.
The important things that should be part of the child’s life in this age group are, but are not limited to safety, comfort, food, and affection. Primarily, this usually comes from the mother. Children in this age group have one source to provide them with the essential needs. Touching, holding, breast feeding, diaper changing, and other things that we have to do for our children all add up to the basic needs for healthy development. With these needs provided, the child can trust the world. The views of the world are mostly demonstrated by the parents. At these ages, they are completely dependent upon parents.
Children in this first stage of development are egocentric, the world revolves around them. Every smile brings praise, every baby talking word coming out of the parents mouth is validation that they are good, welcome, and safe. Everything in their world is about them, the good and the bad. So, what bad are you talking about? Well, imagine yourself not being able to be in any position of your choosing. Your transported from loving arms to a crib, to a carriage, to a playpen, to an infant swing and you have no say in the matter. We are forced to trust our caregivers because there is no one else in our world.
Imagine what happens when the loving, sweet voices begin to being loud and angry voices. Since everything is about us (children), the loud angry voices must be about us as well. There you go, you have created a fresh early maladaptive schema. If the child is hearing the loud and angry voices repeatedly, the maladaptive schema gets more powerful, more reinforced. So, here is the first thing to learn; Don’t scream and shout where your baby can hear you.
For a moment, think about what the child is going through and making decisions about at this age group. They wonder if they can trust their parents if they are receiving mixed messages about them. Sometimes my parents are sweet and loving, and sometimes they are mad a yelling. A baby does not need to hear the out of control arguments, keep them to yourselves parents. Remember, this is trust vs. mistrust. How can we trust an inconsistent input into our lives if they change, and for no reason that the child is able to understand. From the baby’s perspective, I’m good sometimes, and sometimes I am bad. I am safe, and I am not safe. It is a terrible roller coaster to be on, and it creates mistrust of the world.
The record of demon possession did not appear first in the Word of God; communications with the unseen world have
characterized the religious beliefs and practices of all nations from the very earliest times. These beliefs are in accord
as to the existence and the working of superhuman intelligences in the midst of mankind. There has been at all times,
and still is, much superstition mingled with human beliefs. But clearer light is steadily growing, and it is becoming
possible to discern between the various forms of demon working that are seen among us, and to quietly and sanely
dispossess the spirits which enter into the bodies of men and women, and to comfort the minds and allay the fears of
An important fact, but one much disputed among Christian students of this subject, is that believers may become
possessed. It is urged that the Spirit of God cannot dwell in the same body with demons and that those who
so suffer must of necessity be the unsaved. The belief is a natural one and has much to support it from the side
of reason. Dealing, however, with actual cases of demon possession, where the evil spirits were in full control, the writer
can testify that, however it may be explained, sincere Christians have been sufferers and have opposed and resisted
Possession may occur in many ways, and its onset is often most difficult to trace. Children are not infrequently victims
of indwelling spirits (Mark 9:21); a number of cases have been brought to our attention where those who are quite
young have shown every sign of being under demon control. In an older person, the history indicated that the condition
had existed from the time she was about six or seven. How a child can come into this unfortunate situation can only be
Contact with spiritism, often in entire ignorance of the danger, is a frequent cause of possession. In one instance a
Christian girl, whose mother to whom she was greatly attached had passed away, was told that it was possible to contact
the spirit of the mother by means of a medium. Not aware of the evil of such approach, she was soon entangled in the
mysteries of the seance. Before long the medium, realizing that the young woman had an unusual degree of psychic
attainment, invited her to join her in the work of benefiting humanity in which she was herself engaged. The invitation
was accepted, and soon the young woman became, unwittingly to herself, quite under the power of the spirits.
Still unconscious of the fact that they controlled her, she entered a well-known Bible school. There, under spiritual
influences, she began to realize that something was wrong with her. She confided in the wife of one of the faculty, and it
was not long until her condition became known. At once steps were taken for deliverance. Over a period of three
Another instance was encountered in the early part of 1950; the subject being a woman of about thirty-five. In her early
childhood she had been cared for by her grandmother, who was a devotee of Christian Science and who also was
interested in a number of the heterodox cults which flood America. As the child learned to read - she had a very
precocious mind - she was used by the grandmother to read to her their literature. In this way her mind was prepared to
receive demon working. For it is a most serious and solemn fact that, just as the Word of God is charged with heavenly
The woman was converted when nineteen years of age but did not go deeply into spiritual things for a number of years;
in fact not until she had begun to attend a Bible school. Then she began to seriously follow the Lord and was baptized.
After this event, the spirits began to seriously trouble her. She had begun to help in the kitchen of the school where
she was attending; suddenly, while working, she fell unconscious to the floor. This occurred a second time, whereupon
she was taken to the hospital room. There the school doctor visited her and, as her actions were somewhat violent,
decided that it would be best to commit her to the state hospital. A student who was interested in her asked the doctor if
he would allow the writer to first see her, which was granted. She was partly unconscious, and a challenge being given
to the demon, the response came from her lips in a decided "No." The demon was then commanded to name himself, to
which he responded with the word "Cults." When this was followed by casting out of the spirits, the first group that left
her called themselves by the name of well-known cults, surprising some of those present. At intervals, groups of
A third instance was that of a young man of twenty-two years of age. He had been very desirous of the gift of tongues.
Though warned of the serious danger of concentrating on any gift, rather than on the Giver, he persisted in seeking
with intensity. Finally he obtained what he sought. So confident was he that the experience was of the Lord that he
considered he now had sufficient light to carry him forward without the Word of God; the personal revelation was all
satisfying. Then came suddenly the understanding that his tongues were not genuine. The effect was a most bitter
disillusionment. He came to the writer's house, and while attempting to pray became unconscious. The test revealed
the presence of demons, one of whom gave the name of "False Tongues." Deliverance came after a somewhat
protracted struggle, and he is now free in spirit and mind and body. He has learned to abide in the Lord and is
These three recent cases were marked by symptoms very similar in character. The spirits would take entire control of
the personality of their victim, causing the sufferer to become entirely unconscious. So complete was the coma that the
individual was quite unaware of anything that had happened during the period of the attack, which sometimes lasted for
as long as eighteen hours. During this time, the demons would respond to a test, would give their names, would try to
talk with those about, at times would use obscene language or would threaten the helpers. When victory was finally
given, and the man or woman was freed, there would be a period of a few days, or even two or three weeks, when the
effort would be made by the spirits to regain the ground lost. This could only be thwarted by the personal resistance of
Sometimes the afflicted person seemed to be able to see the spirits that surrounded him or her. This is usually a proof
of possession; however, it is not always the case, as some, while conscious of the presence about them of the spirits,
are unable to see them visibly. We have known some who claimed that they could see spirits accompanying them along
the way they went. Incidents of the appearance of dead friends, of spirit rapping, moving of tables and other objects
are common phenomena. One woman, a preacher of the Assemblies of God, told of strange appearances in her home,
where a number of spirits seemed to live, where serpents crawled on the floor and articles fell without apparent cause.
Three instances have been mentioned which are characteristic of one class of demon possession. But there are
frequent cases where individuals do not become unconscious and where the spirit cannot be contacted by the means
spoken of. It has been found impossible at times to deal with these, the spirit apparently paying no attention to prayers
or commands, and this over extended periods. The individuals in such cases often claim to be conscious of the
presence within them of other personalities, who they can at times call by name. It is impossible to judge such persons,
as to their willingness to be delivered; they usually express real concern over their condition and desire to be relieved.
Another class of sufferers is similar to the above in that the spirits do not render them unconscious. Their experience of
the presence of the enemy is usually that of deep mental or physical depression. A young man would complain of
manifestations to his mind; at another time, he felt terrible pressure on his head and ears; again uncontrollable jerking
would take control of his body. A young woman suffered from fear, from manifestations, from a strong desire for
psychiatry. These symptoms, apparently proceeding from demon power, were addressed as demons, called by name,

I should probably explain this. Back home, our grain elevator (where you take the grain after you have harvested it you damn city kids) shares it's driveway with my high school. This was a bit annoying when I was haulin' loads with the ol' John Deere in front of cheerleading practice - but I got to know the owner, Terry, quite well.
Terry was the epitome of a small town guy - he knows every farmer that comes through his place by name, and always remembered the lil stuff - where I was at school, what crazy shit I was involved in (rock bands, radio stations). Anyways, Terry kept a healthy stock of snacks at his place, knowing that most farmers don't have time to take a lunch (although I can admit I have driven a John Deere 7610 (seen below) through the Arby's drive-thru).
Among the usual candy bars and cans of pop was a huge bin of peanuts. I have always loved eating peanuts in the shell and my old man would go up to Terry's and buy a shipment of peanuts - which came in a box of 25lbs. So there is your background on where the 25lb box came from. (This paragraph is intentionally unfunny because any joke would have involved puns about being "asSalted" or jokes about "nuts".)
I had more or less steered clear of the peanuts since he brought them up; seeing as how they are messy and make too much noise during The View - but yesterday I decided it was time to dive in like so many circus elephants.
It is amazing to go back and visit something that stirs up so many memories. At first taste I was back home, cracking peanuts as I worked on the farm, tossing the shells on the floor of the John Deere and hiding my face from the cheerleaders. Then, I was at the Jake (still the Jake to me) sitting in the upper deck on a Wednesday night cracking shells and sipping a beer; cheering on my beloved Tribe.
Then I realized it didn't stir up an exact memory or moment - but just a bunch of good memories. It took me back to places that are most core to me - be it as broad as the memory of the small town in Northwest Ohio that taught me how to get my hands dirty and how to drink a beer; or as exact as the sun going down behind my favorite baseball park as my team makes a run towards October.
So here is a quick list of other things that don't recall so much of an exact memory as just a warm fuzzy feeling (for once not a result of whiskey).
So cheers to realizing an old favorite. And to another reminder of those redneck roots I sometimes forget to flex.
And to hilarious pictures of me on a tractor that I am SURE will be used as blackmail at some point in my life.
I am going to let my nerdiness slip here: I have been to George Washington Carver's home. He did over 200 things with a peanut. Great Man.
Claire - First. Yes - extreme nerdiness but I am not one to talk. Second, there were SOOO many jokes in my head about doing 200 things with one nut - I'm glad you corrected it before I embarrassed myself.
Imagine if there were 200 things to do to a nut, how exponentially would it grow if you threw another into the mix?
BloggingJason - I eat the shell until my tummy dictates its time to crack them fuckers open and just eat the treat.
I'm staying out of the nut jokes... but I will add some things that bring back that warm and fuzzy feeling. :)
- the smell of banana bread (either my mom made this a lot, or she just made it really well, because everytime I smell banana muffins or banana bread, I feel like I'm in my kitchen at home)
- Fla-Vor-Ice. You know those popsicles that come in the plastic sleeves and they would hurt the side of your mouth if you had too many? God, I miss being a kid in the summertime.
- Crocuses and daffodils (we had a ton in our yard, and they were always the first to emerge every Spring... I still look for them every year)
Although it is a cold and bitter winter, this picture is going on my list of things that make me happier than I know what to do with. I will be laughing until the warm breezes of spring in Cleveland blow.
The project work on the transition to a local, circular and participatory governance in which community members are encouraged to act responsibly and consciously for the common good and the exercise of full citizenship.
“The Ecobairro is a Permanent Program with the objective of cooperating to make cities sustainable and peaceful from the transformation of existing neighborhoods into Eco-neighborhoods.

Just wanted to celebrate my winning a $10 on a radio show and I was on radio for a few seconds for the first time in my life... Glad to have the opportunity.

The excellent ElectionLeaflets.Org allows voters to upload and monitor the gazillions of leaflets currently being stuffed through letterboxes up and down the country as polling day approaches. Flicking through the site, Guido was struck by something:
“Thanks to Mrs May and her useless Chancellor Phil Hammond, this will not come without pain. But we escape with imagination and true British grit or we will be boiled alive.
It means on this centenary Remembrance of our struggle against tyranny, we risk ceding non-military victory in Europe to the undemocratic forces of an unaccountable totalitarian regime.”

SALEM, OR -- The local agriculture community is getting an extra push to vote in Tuesday's election. Jerome Rosa, Executive Director of the Oregon Cattlemen’s Association, says farmers often underestimate their power at the ballot box. He encourages them to be well informed and exercise their right to vote.
Rosa says many rural residents don’t feel like their voice is heard. But he points to the 2010 Oregon Governor's race as an example of their importance. “A few years ago, Chris Dudley really could have won the race if the rural communities, particularly eastern Oregon, had came out and voted for him. And that was the difference in the race.” He believes several ballot measures and house races directly impact farmers and ranchers.

For those of you who believe that elections come down to choosing the lesser of two evils: Congratulations! You hold the cards in next week’s election.
The latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll shows that voters who don’t like either party or its leaders are leaning toward Democrats.
In the 2016 Goat Rodeo, you in the “hold your nose and vote” Party helped hand Trump the victory. Those who stayed home, smug in their purity also handed Trump his victory.
I will be holding my nose and voting this year. My polling location is close enough to the river that the smell of dead fish will likely be noticeable. The fish are dead largely due to the policies of the Republicans that have been in power in this state for as long as I can remember. The good news is that In just the last month they have all suddenly become champions of the environment. Much like they have become champions of pre-existing conditions. Yes, DAMMIT go vote!!!
Yep, the “Much like they have become champions of pre-existing conditions” statement kind of gives it away. The sad part is I don’t expect their base to notice the hypocrisy and cynicism. Let me amend that – they won’t notice it or else they will recognize it as a ploy to get the suckers to vote for them and quietly cheer it on until after the results are in. Then they will cheer loudly the votes that went their way and cry ‘voter fraud’ for every vote that did not go their way.
I repeat myself here, but cast your vote, make sure that friends, family, and neighbors cast their votes, offer to drive someone to the polls if they can’t make it alone, volunteer to help at the polls on Election Day, donate doughnuts, coffee, snacks to polling place workers…make voting a big deal because it IS a big deal.
I had to hold my nose and vote because we had to vote for at least one despicable person without any other option. Some races had ‘none of these’ options, but there were about 6 with just one choice. Not voting for those gets your ballot thrown out, so nose held, voted.
Um, where do you live that the ballots are thrown out if you don’t check any boxes? How can that be legal?
Oh, and it is Nevada. It says “pick one in each category” although some categories do have a “none of these” options.
M.Davis – Cripes, sometimes there is a whole page of unopposed Rethugs for various local positions on the ballot here, and since I have an innate inability to fill in an oval with an “R” next to it, that whole page will be left blank. Here (in Warshington state), that will count, for nothing. We also have paper ballots, and state-wide postage-paid mail-in voting.
Purplehead – it can be painful, but since there is just one option then not voting will not change the results. There are other races on the ballot that need a vote so I don’t even look, I just fill in the little oval.
We’ve been living with this weird situation for a few years now, so I have zero minus umpty sympathy (used to be straight zero) for purity ponies who think it is fine to throw mud and otherwise sit out an election because they didn’t get their way.

2016 Workforce 100: Ranking the World’s Top Companies for HR. American Express, which has made the list all three years, takes the top spot in this year’s list of top companies for HR. To excel at everything from talent management to recruiting to benefits to diversity is not an easy task. To shine in those areas year after year is exemplary. Now in its third year, the Workforce 100 recognizes companies that excel in various areas of human resources during the course of the previous year. To determine which companies make the list, Workforce editors work with researchers from the Human Capital Media Advisory Group, the magazine’s research arm.
To find out which companies are the best for HR management, the research team created a statistical formula to shift through publicly available data on HR performance to separate the best from the rest. This year, to give employees more of a “say,” we’ve asked recruiting and job review website Glassdoor Inc. to provide data on what workers are saying about the companies that made our short list. From there, we combined that information with the public data available to create our 2016 Workforce 100 list. American Express Inc. was the top company on this year’s list, and it has made the list all three years. Thirty-three other companies have also made all of the lists.
Once you were embarrassed to go to a sex shop, and now for you, it’s like nothing to do, and only there’s nothing to do there. Many sex toys and games can be made at home by hand. There would be a desire, excitement and some marmalade, for example. Here are some best DIY tips for homemade sex toys.
To create this simple game, you will need a regular plastic cube from a child’s play. Print or cut out logs of the desired size with poses, glue / stick them on the double-sided tape to each face and hope for it.
Next time you can diversify the game: choose images (well, or symbols – for modest ones) of a particular type of sex: traditional, oral, and binding. Alternatively, you can use two dice of different colours. On one describes the parts of the body, on the second – the action. Or prepare a separate cube for yourself and your loved one, and throw one by one!
The whole art is to burn wood cubes. In this case, it is better to copy the silhouettes of images – it is more comfortable in the manufacturing process and looks stylish. Such a hand-made masterpiece can be given on your traditional holiday, for example, the anniversary of your acquaintance. By the way, a device for burning costs twice cheaper, than similar cubes in the store.
Slot machine to collect you, can, and will not work. We suggest you first try to make sex roulette. You’ll need a circle, cut out of cardboard, and the arrow on the button. Draw a circle into sectors and illustrate them with pictures. All within the law! By a similar principle, you can play darts. What is considered a “ten”, you two decide?
Prefer logical games, not gambling? Glue on each roundels paper medallion of erotic subjects. Agree in advance with your favourite games on the conditions: can win as a sword, has become king, and that remained last. By the way, at the same time, you can learn about the preferences of the partner. See too, any drafts he will defend until the end, and what donate. Sex toys for women.
Leather (although this is not a prerequisite) laces will give odds to any female sex accessories. It’s enough to tie them nipples. In combination with a drop of hot wax or ice cubes, which can be carried on your chest, this simple item in the application can give a lot of new sensations.
Does your young man have a knife with vibration? Get out of doubt! The survey, conducted on the forum lovers of sex, showed, that 70% of couples at least once used it for other purposes. Remove the block with the blade – and the mini-vibrator with grooved sides is ready! Remember to only sanitise the device before and after use. It seems that now you will suspiciously look at your electric toothbrush.
Not all men are ready to use purchased nozzles and cock rings for the penis. Someone shy, someone feels uncomfortable, otherwise, and completely painful. There is a simple way out: instead of a circle, use a soft bandage or a gelatin snake, which in the final you can erotically eat. Marmalade bears can also be used: spread them around your partner’s penis, put a condom on top. Voila, not only a new volume but also a ribbed surface!
This is the easiest way to make accessories for games in style. Even if you’re a passionate opponent of all these bindings and simulated penalties, after reading the following instructions, you will try it. Everything is harmless and safe.
Make a gag tasty; sex experts advise you to choose your favourite fruit. It can be a slice of pomelo, a quarter of a peach, a circle of banana. Most importantly, to the edible part of the “cork” is not broke; when you’re going through it, thread the thin rubber band. Therefore, if you voted for a banana, let it be a little unripe.
Whip is essentially a solid handle, to which is attached one or more tails. Take the old rope, cut the cord. Here is the pen. Pre-coat it with black nail polish or acrylic paint and dry thoroughly. In the present whiptails, as a rule, leather. You can make them silk, satin or even fluffy! Cut the material you liked in stripes about 50 cm long and 2 cm wide, gather them in the tail, stretch through the handle and tie the ends in a knot. Done! Use the remaining fabric to create a flirty collar.
Mask. Remember, how to make a carnival mask glasses? The same principle is done and accessory for adult games. A little advice: do significant cut for the eyes, and mask itself is made in the same colour, as the whip handle. You do not want black, then paint your accessories in predatory colours. Or do it pink. Your game is your rules!
One young man decided to arrange a beloved unforgettable night. For this, she placed a candy bar in her vagina, so then slowly and sensually eats it. The night turned out to be exceptional: a couple of hours instead of sex scraped melted chocolate, nuts and raisins! But on this unfortunate experimenter did not stop. Another time, he put it in his favourite cell phone (well, at least he took a miniature model and packed it into a condom!). The idea was as follows: he would call, the phone would vibrate, and the girl would experience an orgasm. But they were disappointed: the subscriber was out of the network coverage area.
The Internet is teeming with ideas on the topic “Do-It-Yourself Sex Toys”. Are particular websites and forums, where you can meet the most complicated instructions and incredible products? People fit the handle of a screwdriver and tennis balls, invent vibrators, simulators, artificial vaginas. Not all methods are equally safe. Hopefully, you know that the objects, made of construction foam and glued with a solvent, not only can cause a severe allergy but merely life-threatening.

My apologies, but this review is going to be a bit frantic due to my brain being so oxygen-starved by the novel’s breath-stealing gorgeousness that I'm feeling a bit light-headed. So please forgive the random thoughts. First: Mary Shelley…I love you!! Second: Dear Hollywood - you lying dung pile of literature-savaging, no talent hacks…you got this all wrong. Please learn to read and get yourself a copy of the source material before you FUBAR it again. Third: My heart shattered for the “monster” an My apologies, but this review is going to be a bit frantic due to my brain being so oxygen-starved by the novel’s breath-stealing gorgeousness that I'm feeling a bit light-headed. So please forgive the random thoughts. First: Mary Shelley…I love you!! Second: Dear Hollywood - you lying dung pile of literature-savaging, no talent hacks…you got this all wrong. Please learn to read and get yourself a copy of the source material before you FUBAR it again. Third: My heart shattered for the “monster” and I haven’t felt this strong a desire to “hug it out, bitch” since reading Grendel and Crooked Letter, Crooked Letter. The “wretch” is so well drawn and powerfully portrayed that he form the emotional ligament for the entire story. He is among the finest creations the written form has to offer. Fourth: As surprised as I am to be saying this, this novel has ousted Dracula as my all time favorite of the classic horror stories…sorry Bram, but the good/evil, sad, desperate loneliness of the orphaned monster trying to find a purpose and to define himself in the world trumps The Count. Five: No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success. Life and death appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and pour a torrent of light into our dark world. A new species would bless me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me. No father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as I should deserve theirs. Pursuing these reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible) renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption. As gorgeous as the prose is, I thought it a crime not to include at least one quote. Six: The “non-explanation” for the process that Victor uses to create the monster is thing of genius. No other approach could have possibly conveyed the majesty and significance of the achievement, because we would have known it was bullshit. Shelley did it perfectly…which leads me nicely into… Seven: The corny, slapdash lightning scene is entirely a work of Hollywood? There’s …NO…lightning…scene? Are you kidding me? Even Kenneth Branagh’s supposedly “true” adaptation had electric eels providing power to the “it’s alive” process. All of it bunk. I’ll say it again, Hollywood is a bunch of useless tools. . LIARS!!! Eight: Speaking of tools, Victor Frankenstein is a giant one. As far as I am concerned, he is clearly the villain of the piece. However, what I found so squee-inducingly magical about Shelly’s writing was my degree of vacillation when it came to Victor’s character. I liked and even admired Victor in the beginning of the story and found his personal journey compelling. He was a genius driven by his desire to unlock the secrets of the universe and had that manic, “mad scientist” focus necessary to the accomplishment of such a lofty goal. However, once the “birth” of the monster came, I found myself waffling back and forth throughout the rest of the story. Ironically, his moment of success and his reaction to life he had conjured was when he began to lose his humanity in my eyes. His treatment of the monster was abhorrent. Despite this, Shelley was able to get me to see over my disgust and appreciate Frankenstein’s position and understand why he was so unwilling to continence the existence of “the wretch.” Not enough for me to forgive his lack of compassion, but enough for me to see him as a tragic figure. Huge propers for Shelley as that is excellent writing. Nine: I would place the monster among the finest literary creations of all time. This singular manifestation of humanity’s scientific brilliance and callous indifference to the consequences thereof is masterfully done. Frankenstein’s “wretch” became the prototype of the literary outcast and every “misunderstood” creature since has been offspring from his loins. His character profile is phenomenal, and just as Victor’s actions garner sporadic moments of understanding for his cruel treatment of the monster, so the monster’s wanton acts of vile cruelty severely test our compassion for him. Tested, bent and stretched, but, for me at least, never broken. I understood his pain…I understood his anger…I understood. Ten: No spoilers here, but the final resolution of the relationship between Victor and the child of his genius was…stellar. Everything was reconciled and nothing was resolved. The final reckoning occurs and it is both momentous and useless. Eleven: I expected the prose to be good but, having never read Shelley before, I was still surprised by how exceptional and ear-pleasing it was. Her writing really resonated with me and I loved her ability to weave emotion, plot momentum and a high literary quotient seamlessly together. Good, good stuff. Twelve: The novel is structured as an epistolary nesting doll using the frame story of Captain Walton corresponding with his sister about his expedition to the North Pole. While at the top of the world, Walton finds Victor Frankenstein stranded. This sets up the dovetail into Walton relaying Victor’s story which takes up the bulk of the novel and includes within it the incredibly poignant story of the “monster” in the creature’s own words. It is superbly executed and I thought the framing device was very effective. Thirteen: Despite my trashing of the movie versions earlier, there was one scene that I thought was handled far better on screen than in this story. Kenneth Branagh’s portrayal of (view spoiler)[ the murder of Elizabeth by the monster (hide spoiler)] was far more chilling than Shelley’s more subdued recounting. I actually anticipated this segment being far more shocking and I was a tad let down as a result. This is probably my only gripe about the book. Fourteen: On my list of all time favorite novels. The writing, the story, the characters, the emotion, the imagery, the power…all off the charts. 6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION! P.S.(or Fifteen:) I listened to the audio version of this read by Simon Vance and his performance was extraordinary, especially his portrayal of the “monster.” Definitely check it out if you are a consumer of audio books.
No stars. That's right. Zero, zip. nada. It's been almost 30 years since I've detested a book this much. I didn't think anything could be worse then Kafka's The Metamorphosis.

Kinda like sticking bamboo shoots between my fingernails type of fun. Watching paint dry fun. Going to an Air Supply concert fun. OK, to be fair, I need to tell you what I liked about this.... Well, Mary Shelley was a teen when she wrote this. Color me impressed. At 19 I was just looking for my next college boyfriend, not penning the great English classic. Kudos to Mary for that. Otherwise, I can't think of anything to admire in this book, apart from the fact that it's the only book in my reading history where I actually noted EVERY SINGLE PAGE NUMBER and mentally counted down the time I'd be finished. Why did I persist, you may ask? Well, at the point where the pain became mind numbing, I decided to channel my inner John McCain and just survive the torture. Figured it would make me a better, stronger reader. Might even make me enjoy a re-read of Breaking Dawn....(well, no it wouldn't, but you get the idea). Frankenstein is a classic alright. A classic melodrama. Complete with a wimpy, vaporish, trembling prima donna main character and a pseudo monster whose only sin is being uglier then Bernie Madoff in cell block D. After the upteenth tremble/jerk/gasp/faint/start from our mad scientist Victor Frankenstein, I could only sign in relief that he wasn't a Rabbi about to perform a bris circumcism - oy vey! Were we supposed to be outraged at the monster's killing spree? By the books end, I was merely miffed that the creature murdered the wrong Frankenstein sibling. He would have saved himself a good deal of traveling (and saved me a good deal of suffering) had he snuffed out his maker before he could high-tail it out of the birthing room. I'm sure that the fans of this book will say that I didn't understand the deeper, symbolic nuances of this book, and I'm sure that they are right. At this point in my life, all I know is what I like and don't like in a book, and as far as I'm concerned, this book is unadulterated, mind-numbing crap. But that's just me. Your mileage will vary (as I sincerely hope it does). As for my own mileage, it can best be compared to driving a Ford Pinto in the Indy 500... EDIT Due to the efforts of a few Kool-ade drinking trolls who have gotten their big girl/big boy panties in a wad over an almost 200 year old book and can't comment nicely on my review, I am suspending all future comments. Don't like it? Blame the navel grazing trolls for not accepting the concept of a PERSONAL OPINION.
“I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.” I was walking along earlier today with Jacquie and discussing the important things like, you know... books. And the subject of our top favourite books of all time came up. Oddly enough, two of our top three were the same - Wuthering Heights and Crime and Punishment. Then Jacquie said her third was a book that I hadn't thought “I have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine and rage the likes of which you would not believe. If I cannot satisfy the one, I will indulge the other.” I was walking along earlier today with Jacquie and discussing the important things like, you know... books. And the subject of our top favourite books of all time came up. Oddly enough, two of our top three were the same - Wuthering Heights and Crime and Punishment. Then Jacquie said her third was a book that I hadn't thought about in a very long time. That book was Frankenstein. It hit me like a shot of good literature: I had forgotten all about this classic that had so affected me, made me think and completely torn my heart out multiple times. Frankenstein? I said. I must go review that right now. You see, though, the best and worst thing about this novel is how distorted it has become by constant movie adaptations and misinformed ideas about the nature of Frankenstein and his "monster". For years I thought Frankenstein was the name of that slightly green dude with the bolts in his neck. Nuh-uh. Did Frankenstein scare me? Did it have me staying awake and sleeping with the light on, jumping at every slight creak in the house? Was I terrified of the monster and technology and the dangers of playing God? No. Because the beauty of this story is that it isn't the one so many people think it is. Which is almost my favourite thing about it. This book is not a Halloween kind of story with Halloween kind of monsters. This story is nothing short of heartbreakingly sad. “...once I falsely hoped to meet the beings who, pardoning my outward form, would love me for the excellent qualities which I was capable of unfolding.” The book offers many interesting avenues of philosophical exploration if one is so inclined to ponder such things; for example, allusions to religion and Genesis, possible criticisms of using science to "play God", the relationship between creator and creation. All of these things interest me, yes, but it is the painfully human part of this book that has always so deeply affected me. Because the sad thing, the really sad thing, is that pretty much everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... but so many don't know how human the character is. Created as a scientific experiment by an overly ambitious man, he comes into a frightening and hostile world that immediately rejects him on sight. Even the man who made him cannot look upon his creation without feeling horror. It's that same thing that gets me in books every time: things could have been so different. If people had just been a little less judgmental, a little less scared, and a little more understanding. This being, created from different parts of corpses, seeks love and finds hatred, so he instead decides to embrace it. Fuelled by his own rage at the unfairness of the world, he gradually turns towards evil. Everyone knows him as "the monster" so it's hard for me to call him anything else, but I basically always saw him like this: He belongs in my own little mind category with the likes of Heathcliff and Erik (aka The Phantom of the Opera). Scared, angry villains who were made so by their own unfortunate circumstances that plunged them into worlds where they couldn't find a place. The kind of characters you simultaneously hate and love, but most of all hope they find some kind of peace. So call it science-fiction, if you will. Call it horror, if you must. But this story is brimming with some of the most realistic and almost unbearably moving human emotion that I have ever read. Blog | Leafmarks | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr
So. I finished it. Warning: If you are a fan of classic literature and/or are utterly devoid of a sense of humor, stop reading this review right now. I've always wondered what the real Frankenstein story was like...and now I know. Sadly, sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality. And the reality is, this book is a big steaming pile of poo. It's an old-timey horror story, right? Not so much. I mean, I wasn't expecting it to actually be scary, but I thought it might be slightly creepy. Unfortunatel So. I finished it. Warning: If you are a fan of classic literature and/or are utterly devoid of a sense of humor, stop reading this review right now. I've always wondered what the real Frankenstein story was like...and now I know. Sadly, sometimes the fantasy is better than the reality. And the reality is, this book is a big steaming pile of poo. It's an old-timey horror story, right? Not so much. I mean, I wasn't expecting it to actually be scary, but I thought it might be slightly creepy. Unfortunately, the only horror in the story centered around me having to keep turning the pages. Unless... Beware mortal! You will DIE of boredom! Oooga-Booga-Booga! Yep. Truly frightening. It starts like this: An upper-crust guy sails off to the Arctic to make discoveries, and to pass the time he writes to his sister. Supposedly, he's been sailing around on whaling ships for several years. And he's been proven an invaluable resource by other captains. So I'm assuming he's a pretty crusty ol' sailor at this point. Pay attention, because this is where Shelly proves that she knows nothing about men... So this guy goes on and on in these letters to his sister about how he wishes on every star that he could find a BFF at sea. After a few (too many) letters, they pull a half-frozen Frankensicle out of the water. Aaaaand here's what our salty sea dog has to say about the waterlogged mad scientist... "Blah,blah, blah...his full-toned voice swells in my ears; his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness...blah, blah, blah..." Lustrous eyes?! No (straight) sailor ever, in the history of the world, EVER referred to another dude's eyes as lustrous. Ever. And I know what you're thinking. Well, Anne, maybe this character was gay. Didn't think about that, didja?! Actually, yes. Yes, I did. The only problem with that theory is that NONE of the male characters in this book sounded remotely male. Ladies, do you remember that time in your life (probably around middle or high school), when you thought that guys actually had the same sort of thought waves running through their heads that we do? You know, before you realized that the really don't care about...well, all of the things that we do? You thought that while they were laughing at the booger their idiot friend just flicked across the room, something deeper was stirring in their mind. It just had to be! I'm not sure when it happens, but at some point, every woman finally realizes the (fairly obvious) truth. Men aren't women. That booger was the funniest thing ever, and nothing was stirring around in them other than maybe some gas. And that's ok. Fart-lighting and long distance loogie hawking contests aside, they can pretty darn cool. But this author was too young to realize that. My personal opinion is that Mary was probably fairly sheltered when it came to real men. She was a teenage girl apparently running around with a bunch of artsy-fartsy dudes. Much like today, I would imagine these junior emos were probably blowing poetic smoke up her young ass in the high hopes of getting into her pants. Although it's possible I'm totally misreading the situation. Anyway, Frank tells his story, and Sea Dog writes it all down for his sister. In excruciating detail. Rivers, flowers, rocks, mountain tops...agonizingly cataloged. And the weather? God forbid a breeze blows through the story without at least a paragraph devoted to the way it felt on his skin or affected his mood! And speaking of Frankenstein's mood. I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of reading about a character this spineless before. What a pussy! He didn't talk so much as he whined. And the swooning! He was like one of those freaking Fainting Goats! I can't even count how many times he blacked out and fell over. Of course, then he would get feverish and need "a period of convalescence" to recover. Again, every episode was recounted with incredible attention to detail. I'm thrilled that I never had to miss a moment of his sweaty brow getting daubed with water! Randomly Inserted Fun Fact: The monster quoted Milton in Paradise Lost. Shockingly, I only know this because it was in the appendix, and not because I have any real-life experience with reading that one. Was this the most painfully unnecessary book I've read this year? Yes. Is there a deeper moral to this story? Yes. Some would say, that the monster is a product of a society that refuses to accept someone who is different. Or maybe that Victor Frankenstein was the real monster for not realizing that he had a duty to parent and care for his creation? Perhaps it is meant to point out our obsession with perfection, and our willingness to disregard people who don't meet the standards of beauty as non-human? Some might say any of those things. I , however, learned a far different lesson from Frankenstein. And it's this... Trust no one. Not even someone who (just an example) has been your Best Friend for decades! Let's read a classic, Anne. It'll be fun, Anne. We can call each other with updates, Anne. It'll be just like a book club, Anne. Tee-hee! Liar, liar! Pants on fire! I read this whole God-awful book, and you quit after 10 pages! I'm telling your mom! Anyway. Here's the quote that sums up my experience with Frankenstein: "Blah, blah, blah...in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure."
This was awesome. I listened to an audiobook on YouTube (as it is under the public domain). You can find it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuyEa.... It was great. The narrator did a great job of building the atmosphere and excitement in the story. I always love reading the original stories behind some very iconic pop culture figures.

It's been fifty years since I had read Frankenstein, and, now—after a recent second reading—I am pleased to know that the pleasures of that first reading have been revived. Once again--just as it was in my teens--I was thrilled by the first glimpse of the immense figure of the monster, driving his sled across the arctic ice, and marveled at the artful use of narrative frames within frame, each subsequent frame leading us closer to the heart of the novel, until we hear the alienated yet articulat It's been fifty years since I had read Frankenstein, and, now—after a recent second reading—I am pleased to know that the pleasures of that first reading have been revived. Once again--just as it was in my teens--I was thrilled by the first glimpse of the immense figure of the monster, driving his sled across the arctic ice, and marveled at the artful use of narrative frames within frame, each subsequent frame leading us closer to the heart of the novel, until we hear the alienated yet articulate voice of the creature himself. In addition, I admired the equally artful way the novel moves backward through the same frames until we again reach the arctic landscape which is the scene of the novel's beginning...and its end. This time through, I was particularly struck with how Mary must have been influenced by the novels of her father. The relentless hounding of one man by another who feels his life has been poisoned by that man's irresponsible curiosity is a theme taken straight out of Godwin's Caleb Williams, and the cautionary account of a monomaniac who gradually deprives himself of the satisfactions of family, friends and love in pursuit of an intellectual ideal is reminiscent of the alchemist of St. Leon. Her prose also is like her father's in her ability to make delicate philosophical distinctions and express abstract ideas, but she is a much better writer than he: her sentences are more elegant and disciplined, and her descriptive details more aptly chosen and her scenes more effectively realized. The conclusion of the novel seems hasty and incomplete, but perhaps that is because the concept of Frankenstein is so revolutionary that no conclusion could have seemed satisfactory. At any rate, this fine novel has given birth to a host of descendants, and—unlike Victor Frankenstein—is a worthy parent of its many diverse creations.
"My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human.” The Creature’s diet is unmistakably vegetarian. Vegetarianism becomes a way for the creature to renounce his crea "My food is not that of man; I do not destroy the lamb and the kid, to glut my appetite; acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment. My companion will be of the same nature as myself, and will be content with the same fare. We shall make our bed of dried leaves; the sun will shine on us as on man, and will ripen our food. The picture I present to you is peaceful and human.” The Creature’s diet is unmistakably vegetarian. Vegetarianism becomes a way for the creature to renounce his creator by demonstrating his more inclusive ethics. Indeed, he includes within his moral code animals as well as man, but learns through his experience with the world that both he and animals are excluded from the moral compass of humanity: they are not on the same level. I find this entire representation fascinating, that much so I wanted to add to my review here. I spent a very long time last year researching Percy Shelley’s poetry and how his politics are ultimately shaped by his diet choice. Some of that content is latent in Mary’s work; it does not take the forefront of the narrative, but it is certainly there for a reader who is willing to look for it. There’s much here to use for a proper developed argument, arguments I am eventually going to explore fully in my eventual PhD project. One of my chapters will be a critical address of Frankenstein and The Last Man in conjunction with politics and diet. Indeed, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein mirrors her husband’s discourse in A Vindication of a Natural Diet. In the essay Percy Shelley directly references the promethean myth; he states that it is a prime allegory for man’s lost nature (his fall from the golden age), as when Prometheus applied fire (for culinary purposes- Percy Shelley states) he created a disgusting horror. His liver was wrecked by the “vulture of disease” and all tyrannical vice, this unnaturalness, was born from the despoiling of innocence as it “consumed his being in every shape of its loathsome and infinite variety.” The Creature, after trying cooked offal left by a campfire in Frankenstein, decides to adhere to his own diet; he rejects the promethean fire that humanity has taken, and instead develops a mode of morality separate to the norms of humanity; he wishes for the opportunity to live this peaceful picture away from the corruptions of human company: he wishes to be better. Orginal Review from 2015 Let’s have a party Victor. Let’s get together and celebrate all things Gothic, and dark, and wonderful. Let’s have it in an attic in an old house in the middle of a thunderstorm, and then afterwards let’s go to the graveyard with our shovels and our body bags. Sounds good doesn’t it Victor? We could then create our own doppelgängers from the corpses of criminals and geniuses. Then we can abandon our marvellous creation to fend for itself with his childlike innocence, and then wonder why it goes so horribly wrong and blows up in our faces. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. On second thought we probably shouldn’t have that party. Because if we did it would end in blood Yes, lots of blood: the blood of everyone you love, the blood of all your family Victor. You blame the monster, but you are his creator. You should have taught him the ways of the world and guided his first steps. The things you two could have accomplished together. So I ask you this Victor, who is the real monster? Is it the creature that has gone on a murderous rampage or it you? You are the man who played at god and was horrified at the consequence. You judged your creation by his physical appearance, which was more a reflection of your vain soul. Ahh..Victor you silly, brilliant, man. Surely you don’t wonder why the monster revenged himself upon you? “I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel...” Indeed, the real monster of this novel is Victor Frankenstein, and not his monstrous creation. The creature is a monster on the outside but Victor is on the inside, which is a form much worse. By abandoning the creature he has taught him to become what his appearance is. The first human experience he receives is rejection based upon his physicality. His own creator recoils in disgust from him. He cannot be blamed for his actions if all he has been taught is negative emotion, he will only respond in one way. He is innocent and childlike but also a savage brute. These are two things that should never be put together. Woe to Victor Frankenstein’s family. “There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.” Mary Shelley raises questions of the danger of knowledge, and shows a probable consequence of trying to play god; the novel portrays nineteen century fears for the rising field of science and knowledge and questions how far it could go. Indeed, in this case Victor takes on the role of a God by creating new life. She also shows us what can happen to a man if he so driven by this thirst for knowledge and how it will ultimately lead to a fall. Victor reminds me somewhat of Doctor Faustus (The Tragical History of the Life and Death of Doctor Faustus) in this regard. Faustus is a man who sold his soul to Lucifer for unlimited knowledge in the form of arcane magic. Victor, like Faustus, has stopped at nothing to gain his goal, but in the end is ultimately dissatisfied with the result. Suffice to say, I simply adore this book as you may have gathered from my ramblings. I think this, alongside Dracula, are amongst the strongest representations of Gothic literature. Furthermore, I have a real soft spot for epistolary means of storytelling. I’m not sure why, perhaps it’s the stronger sense of intimacy you fell with the characters as you see their words on the page rather than an impartial narrators. You see inside their heads more and understand their motifs and feelings. My favourite quote: "This was then the reward of my benevolence! I had saved a human being from destruction, and as a recompense I now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone. The feelings of kindness and gentleness which I had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth. Inflamed by pain, I vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind. Listen to the passion, to the intellect and witness such a wasted opportunity. Victor, you’re a silly, silly, man.

I figure it was a good time for a reread since it was one of my favorites and it has been over 20 years since I read it. I did enjoy it again this time and it stands up to the 5 star review and designation of classic. There were a few slow parts - mainly when Dr. Frankenstein would stop the narrative to wax poetical about something - but, not enough t take a way from my overall enjoyment. I still recommend this for everyone and be sure to check out my full original review below. ORIGINAL REVIEW: This is definitely one of my favorite books I was required to read in High School. Also, it is my favorite of the classic horror novels. It is perfectly written, suspenseful, and is a bit more thought provoking than scary. One of the best ways I can compare it to other classic horror novels is to Dracula - which I read recently. Dracula has so much repetitive filler that you do not find in Frankenstein, which is the main reason I find Frankenstein to be a more enjoyable book. Also, I would say that this is more a novel of the human condition than an actual horror novel. Some terrifying things happen, but it is the monster within all of us that may end up being more terrifying! Funny side story: when I read this in High School, it was around the same time that the Kenneth Branaugh adaptation came out at the theaters. We were all encouraged to go see it and found it pretty close to the source material. What was amusing was that Time Magazine had a review of the movie bashing it as untrue to the source material and how disappointed Shelley would be that the Boris Karlovian depiction of a lurching, flattop monster with bolts in its neck was ignored for a more serious drama movie. WHAT!? Time Magazine, for goodness sakes, published an article that claims to know the content of the book but is completely wrong and does it while bashing a movie that did a pretty good job with it!? I mean, it it is okay if you prefer the old time movie version of Frankenstein - and it is a classic - but to make definitive statements that are completely wrong in what is supposed to be a well thought of publication (not your typical tabloid supermarket checkout fodder), that is just too much! We need a copy editor over here!

Mary was – what? – eighteen years old when she went on this famous holiday to Lake Geneva with Percy Bysshe Shelley and Byron and Byron's physician. She was calling herself ‘Mrs Shelley’, though they had not yet married – Percy was still married to someone else. The surroundings were familiar. The last time Mary and Percy had come to Switzerland had been during their elopement a couple of years earlier, accompanied by her sister, who was also in love with him; Mary had got pregnant, but the baby girl was born prematurely and died in February 1815. Now they were back, trying to put the past behind them and enjoy a holiday with Byron, who at the time was sleeping with Mary's stepsister. Percy's first wife would soon be out of the picture, found drowned in the Serpentine in an ‘advanced state of pregnancy’ before the year was out. Mary's other sister Fanny also drowned herself that year, 1816, also pining for Percy. So it was in the midst of this complex love-dodecahedron that the holidaymakers, their festive plans foiled by constant rain, held their famous competition to write a ghost story. The result is something very different from its image in popular culture. Instead of the smoke of Victorian London, we have the Swiss Alps and the Orkney Islands; instead of Igor and bolts through the neck, we have meditations on personal autonomy, scientific responsibility and eugenics. Frankenstein is overwritten and the narrative structure is a bit odd – she was still a teenager when she wrote it, let's not forget – but thematically, it's fascinating. I'm surprised by how few reviews I've read touch on what seems to me to be the intensely female experiences that it obliquely comments on. The confusion of bringing a creature into the world only to feel horror and revulsion towards it. The stress of releasing it into a hostile and uncaring world. And perhaps most of all, the deep sympathy shown with someone who feels that their body is not their own, that it is somehow owned and regulated by others. A body that one is taught by society to hate. The monster's feelings are unimportant, because he was created by a man for the man's own gratification. Mary quotes her beloved Percy Bysshe Shelley, unattributively, when Dr Frankenstein first spots his creature up on the Mer de Glace. She uses the final two stanzas from ‘Mutability’. For me though it's the beautiful first stanza that better expresses the ferocious intensity of Mary and her circle of friends and lovers, surrounded as they all seemed to be by imminent, premature death: We are as clouds that veil the midnight moon; How restlessly they speed, and gleam, and quiver, Streaking the darkness radiantly!—yet soon Night closes round, and they are lost forever… As they all were. But the writing they left behind will last as long as English literature is read, and for all of its problems Frankenstein is among that select group.
With the support of Volvo Car Italia, the LifeGate PlasticLess project for the reduction of plastics in Italian seas entered in the operational phase, with the installation of the first Seabin device last week in the port of Marina di Varazze.
Within a few days the installation of the other two "baskets of the sea" will be completed in the ports of Marina di Cattolica (RN) and Venezia Certosa Marina (VE).
The announcement was made yesterday during a press conference held at Volvo Studio Milano, during which LifeGate explained that every Seabin plastic removal device is able to capture over half a ton of plastic waste per year, including the microplastics.
The LifeGate PlasticLess project, of which Volvo Car Italia is a partner, is part of Volvo Cars' wide-ranging commitment to sustainability, which this year has also led to the support of the Clean Seas campaign promoted by the United Nations.
As part of the fight against plastics, Volvo announced the project to eliminate disposable plastics in all offices, canteens and in-house events, in favor of more sustainable alternatives, including biodegradable paper, pulp and wood products .
In 2018, the initiative will replace over 140 tonnes of single-use plastic items with products made of non-plastic alternative materials.

“One is often told that it is a very wrong thing to attack religion, because religion makes men virtuous. So I am told; I have not noticed it.”
In reality, though, the issue of online cheating is more complex—especially when it concerns sexual activities involving actual interaction with other individuals.But they may be so when participants are also involved in another primary offline relationship, because of the harm imposed on those partners.In this regard, the following aspects are particularly significant: All of these worries are genuine and can be found in many online relationships.As a 29-year-old married woman who often engages in cybersex, says: When people feel trapped by their current circumstances, but still do not want to ruin their relationship, cyberspace may offer a parallel world in which things are better.Time spent in that world can help them their actual world, while not giving up on having exciting, even emotional experiences.
Recent research found infants develop the ability to distinguish between a video call with another human being and footage on the TV within the first few months of life.
Online sexual activity can involve various activities, such as viewing explicitly sexual materials, participating in an exchange of ideas about sex, exchanging sexual messages, and online interactions with at least one other person with the intention of becoming sexually aroused.
The fact that most of these affairs are concealed from offline spouses is indicative of the possible harm.
Consider this reaction: Just as casual sex is not necessarily inherently harmful, neither are online affairs.

Hard Rock Calling rarely holds any surprises. The headliners and going to be huge and the Marshalls will be stacked up, But never has the power of rock music been so visible than at this year’s event. The importance of this year’s event contributed to the cancellation of Hit factory Live to make the site safe; this festival had to go ahead.
Bruce Springsteen even weighed in while Westminster council were debating the future of Hyde Park gigs. But despite Hyde Park’s notorious volume and clarity failings, nothing was going to stop this weekend from rocking out.
Although London’s rock n roll heart was suppressed by bureaucratic killjoys when Bruce Springsteen’s performance with Sir Paul McCartney was cut short during The Boss’ headline slot, the power of the axe had firmly asserted itself.
Indeed Springsteen’s three and a half hour set was assuringly inspiring. Sauntering on stage in blue collar and waistcoat, he gives a coy wave and has a little chat before starting a piano led rendition of Thunder Road, just a voice and keys, putting Hyde Park in absolute silence. It’s a far cry from the relative amateurish shock and awe intro of a Coldplay concert.
A Springsteen set is always for the die-hards. Who else could tolerate a 15 minute band-jam roll calls, and the return of John Fogarty after his set of soft Americana earlier in the day? But a rawkus version of Because The Night, and final rewards of the trio of big hitters — Dancing In The Dark, Born In The USA and Born To Run — convert the blackest of hearts.
It became OK for a new generation to like The Boss when the Moldy Peaches’ Adam Green released Born To Run as a B-side to his 2003 single Jessica. An appreciation for Paul Simon, however, is a much more recent occurrence. The afrobeat trend gripping discos owes a debt to 1987’s Gracelands, which for many of us is still the album of endless late 80’s car journeys.
Simon dictates the set in two parts, his non-Gracelands back catalogue, including appearances by Jimmy Cliff and Hugh Masekela, followed by a complete band change for the arrival of Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the original touring band. The Boy In The Bubble’s accordion, Call Me Al’s horns and Mambazo’s synchronised harmonies sending Hyde Park crazy with memories of damp Cortinas and Going Live.
But it’s Simon himself who is the star, as he stuns everyone with spine shivering acoustic versions of The Boxer and Sound Of Silence, the undoubted highlights of the entire weekend.
While Springsteen and Simon signal the dominance of heritage acts, Friday’s headliners Soundgarden are the champions of the revival, a band who’ve finally come of age and look better than ever. Chris Cornell has matured into the coolest rock star imaginable in mid-length leather jacket and Matt Cameron, who finished touring with his side project, Pearl Jam, three days earlier, has his drums at stage level, simply letting his phenomenal expertise do the showing off for him.
They play tracks from all their albums, even Beyond The Wheel from Ultramagnetic Ok, but it’s Jesus Christ Pose followed by Black Hole Sun which really shake the earth. So much in fact that the heavens are appropriately shattered during the latter, causing the looming rain cloud to erupt. Cornell confesses he forgot to write a song on the set list so would play it in the encore. It’s Rusty Cage, a song so important to grunge teens it’s impossible to contain the excitement of the early 30s crowd.
They end with Slaves and Bulldozers, a song they didn’t play the only other time we’d seen them at Reading 95 and it’s truly phenomenal. It lingers in the air as Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd play a dirgy kiss-chase which is teasingly hypnotic. Cornell announces this was a nostalgia set, and they’ll be back later in the year with new songs, they mean business.
The main stage's supporting line-up over the weekend was clearly to fill time until the megastars appeared. Lady Antebellum’s soft rock and Alison Kraus and Union Station’s vast county fail to ignite anything other than the gasoline powering middle America’s truck stops. Even Iggy and the Stooges’ timeless garage is tiresomely predictable. Of course Iggy Pop, will always be a writhing demi-god, but maybe it’s time to put a shirt on. At least Punch Brothers’ bespoke urban bluegrass was excitedly refined.
While Hard Rock Calling is undoubtedly for a more mature demographic, there is still an amazing array of exciting music on offer. The Hard Rock Rising Stage, which is wonderfully enclosed with bars and seating areas, hosts the first festival gig by Deap Vally whose liquor spittin’ garage rock is creakingly vintage and wonderfully vital. It makes up for a lacklustre show by The Launderettes who are fairly static on stage until the bassist starts getting into the groove, but their Hammond rock garage is too sedate.
The stage’s weekend highlight was a sparsely crowded headline slot by Dylan Le Blanc who appears after only three hours sleep. He’s joined by pedal steel legend BJ Cole for a half hour of beautiful Neil Young-esque melancholia which is wistfully gentlemanly with deep-south understatement.
On the outdoor bandstand Danny Shah plays the bland baladeering of an advert during Hollyoaks, and Daytona Lights chase the departing bandwagon with their catchy but instantly forgettable afropop. Luckily Drop Out Venus save a weak stage of wannabe’s with their juddering junk jazz, which is vitally ferocious and mesmerizingly intense. Their part Velvent Underground, part wide-eyed Wilko Johnson frantic nihilism might just be the greatest thing played in Hyde Park this year. Amazing.
Hard Rock Calling’s jaw dropping surprise is New York born rock goddess LP aka Laura Pergolizzi, her pixie Leo Sayer demeanour masking an awe-inspiring vocal talent on the Pepsi Max stage. She’s dressed exactly the same as Springsteen the night before, a statement of her intent to take on the rock world. Her musicians resemble a hodgepodge mariachi band, with a weedy multi-instrumentalist, a cartel-henchman drummer and a guitarist itching to be in Machine Head. As LP sings her feet scattily shuffle, before clamouring on the monitors to deliver an operatic sermon of vocal virtuosity. This is her first UK gig and she is mystifyingly captivating.
The Pepsi Max stage retains the huge volume and clarity experienced at Wireless, but Big Country fail to make the most of it, their trademark bagpipe guitars being lost under Mike Peters' bravado. Gary Clark Jr also falls short, mainly due to his backing band lacking the expertise needed to support his intense guitar playing. He’s still in training, but being supported by blues-rock standards is holding him back.
There is no such problem for Dawes who make the classic Laurel Canyon sound as relevant as ever by introducing pummelling drumming and driving bass line to Taylor Goldsmith's gripping voice. A Little Bit Of Everything sounds particularly close knit and inclusive, while securing their main stage destiny.
Hard Rock Calling knows exactly what it’s doing. The big bucks are in heritage acts, and they’re able to attract them with an iconic venue and a guaranteed audience, but it’s a festival which could try harder. The main stage lower order simply isn’t exciting enough, but booking acts like LP, Drop Out Venus and Dylan Le Blanc shows their commitment to supporting rock music at all levels. It’s unfortunate that the main focus fell on the Springsteen debacle because Hard Rock Calling was an incredible success.

No one really knows if somewhere in the group of 16 London Soccer Academy players heading to England tomorrow, there will be another Tyler Hemming.
Hemming is the 16-year-old Londoner who played for London City of the Canadian Professional Soccer League. He's also a member of the Academy. He turned heads with Grimsby Town when he attended a tryout in October. He is expected to return to Grimsby in March, when he may be offered a contract.
Grimsby has a working relationship with the Academy, which under the tutelage of London City coach Jurek Gebczynski, works with players of all ages from all teams to improve their skills.
Ian Knight, Grimsby's director of youth development, has made several trips to London looking for talent. On one, he found Hemming. What was a dribble has become an open tap. This time around, he's focused on eight individuals.
"He identified eight younger boys he wanted me to get over," said Cam Vassallo of the Academy. "The idea is that they can't make any promises to 13- and 14-year-olds right now. But they wanted them to get a taste of what it's like to prepare them for the future couple of years down the road. (Knight) is very interested in the young ones.
"We aren't under any illusions. Younger boys will go over and find it tough. Hopefully they will impress them enough to ask them to come back."
Grimsby also allowed the Academy leeway in bringing other players it felt had potential for the purpose of scrimmaging. Eight others will go. The 16 players will leave tomorrow and return Dec. 21.
The boys will pay for their flight to England, while the eight invited by Knight will have their accommodations paid for.
"Our idea is to develop them to the standard of European players," Gebczynski said. "Our problem is the highest competitive league we have is the CPSL. We have to bring up those kids where they can easily play in the CPSL at the age of 15, 16, 17. Then we are pretty sure they might be able to compete."
Gebczynski believes the trip is important not only for the development of the players, but also to give them an idea of the standards in Europe. It's one of the reasons he's going as well.
"This is a good arrangement for us because everybody is looking for good players in Europe and with everyone looking, it's difficult to sign them," Gebczynski said. "That's why they look here for players."
"Some kids will have a hard time over there," he said. "Some might be surprised at how difficult it is to be a professional. If they have potential, they'll be able to work on it. So the trip's a good thing. We want to see how those guys perform in a pressure situation."
Making the trip from North London Soccer Club are Michael Pereira, 12, and Tyler Carey 13. Going from London United are Fidel Villanueva, 14, Sergio Lesik, 14, and Angus Gordon, 14. The Greater London Soccer Club has four players going: Anthony Vassallo, 14, Adam Trevitt, 15, Anthony Mavrikkou, 16 and Brian Yanful, 16. Two players from Forest United, Arnold Kostkowski, 12, and David Kwiek, 13, will be heading to England. Geordan Moogk, 13, of Nucleo Sporting; Dan Barreiras, 16, of Southend United and three 16-year-old players from Windsor, Ryan Mendoca, John Grigorakis and Adrian Jaworski, round out the group.
Putting players in the ultra-competitive and intensive program of professional soccer in England is one way of finding out not only if a player has potential but if he has the desire to work for success. Gebczynski believes that to make it at that level, soccer has to be "in your blood." Skills are great but skills die without dedication.
"This trip might give kids the additional push because they see there is something at the end of the tunnel," he said. "They see the commitment is there. It's what I'm looking for. Cam used to call all those kids to come out to practice and I said, 'Cam, don't do that. If they don't want to come that's fine.' "
And he holds up Hemming as an example of exactly what a player can do with the right combination of skills, attitude and dedication.

Today is the long awaited day to have your ankle repaired. Dr. Tressler has called me from the OR suite to let me know what he is actually going to do today. When he took off your splint to the left foot the lateral (outside) aspect of your ankle/heel did not look good (the outside skin tissue was not conducive to opening and exposing bone to, at this time). Dr. Tressler believes this was caused from pressure on the side of our foot. He is going ahead and work on the ankle, try and locate the taler body and pin your ankle, then reposition the tibia somewhat. He also talked about putting a pin in your calcaneous (heel) to help take some of the pressure off of your lateral aspect of the foot to aid in healing that area for future surgery. I am not sure when your mouth is going to be re-wired as Dr. Tressler was not going to be able to give the Oral/Maxillary surgeons his OR suite when he is done with you as he has two other long cases following you.
We have thought of other acronyms for LAMP besides Look At Me Please, Lord Acknowledge My Path, and Lord Answer My Prayers.
Dr. Tressler just came out to speak to us at 7:15 pm to give us the summary of your surgery. He started off saying he could not have been more pleased with the outcome and how the foot looks. He said he ended up repairing both the ankle and the heel. The area of the L lateral heel that he thought was pressure was definitely pressure—the heel bone was poking out. He cleaned the area and the heel bone and went ahead and repaired it. He also said your surgery was the most difficult case he has done thus far.
The ankle had to be fused because he could not locate the bony piece he thought might have been imbedded in your foot. He rebuilt your ankle bone and your heel bone and placed a plate to stabilize the ankle so it won’t collapse.
He then repaired your L fibula as it was externally rotated which once put back in place allowed your foot to sit right and the tibia did to need to be repositioned.
Dr. Tressler then called in Dr. Hagan, who is the Chief of Plastics, to take a look at the wound on your heel from where the tibia came through. Dr. Hagan debrided (cleaned) the wound down to fresh, good blood flow, tissue and placed a wound vac in your heel. The wound vac will keep the wound free of infection and allow healing from the inside out. Then the plan is to do a “reverse skin flap” over the wound to close the wound completely. He will take some skin tissue from the mid aspect of your left sole and lay it over the wound to cover the wound.
There is no other surgery needed on your ankle or heel, barring no complications, except for the flap. The flap could take pace in a coupe of weeks to months, we are not sure. Dr. Tressler did say that you had told him you could feel the bottom of your foot a couple of times. He also said your screw in your right leg could be seen under your skin as you had lost enough weight. He said, “It’s nothing a number of cheeseburgers couldn’t fix.” Evidently you lost approximately 500 cc of blood from your foot. Dr. Tressler said he never had so much blood come from a foot, usually 100 cc, but not 500 cc. He went ahead and transfused you with a unit of blood, not so much because you needed it but because it would give you good oxygenation.
Dr. Tressler asked what color of car you drove, wanted to know if it was blue. We told him you had a gray jeep, and asked why he wanted to know. He said he found a blue paint chip in your foot.
Mark 11:24 “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.”
We thank God for answered prayers. You came through the surgery beautifully! You arrived in your room at approximately 8:30pm. You were awake, alert, NOT on the ventilator, and complaining of pain. Your right leg had the splint completely off and the leg looked great. You rose up to look at your leg.
You had the wrist restraints back on because our nurse told us you pulled your trach out last night. She found you sitting in bed holding your trach in your hand. You never dropped your oxygen saturation which is good but they paced a new one in last night.
You were asking for something to drink but you could not have anything. I asked the nurse if you could maybe have some ice ships or suck on a wet washcloth. The nurse gave you a couple of oral swabs that were wet for you to suck on. Before we left the nurse informed us you were scheduled for OR tomorrow to get your mouth re-wired. I am glad that is getting done so there won’t be anymore surgery after the mouth for a while.
I pray that all healing will be done without complication of infection and the healing is done quickly.
Gma and Gpa Short, Uncle Steve and Aunt Kathy, Dad and I arrived for visiting hours around 1pm and you were not in your room. You were down in the “neuro gym” building what looked like plumbing pipe models. You were actually involved with your occupational therapy. The therapist would give you a picture of the model you were to build. You then had to find the correct pieces and build the model. We all went down to the “neuro gym” to watch you work. You did a fantastic job – you built the models without any problem.
We visited for a while – I showed your nurse how to put on your bands on your teeth correctly. You were pretty tired from your therapy so we left – to return later for the evening visit.
When we all returned (Keaton too!) we entered a full room of visitors. You seemed much more alert with a little more energy. You shared that you wanted to get a haircut on Wednesday. You have not lost your WIT as you made a joke of Gpa Short and how much he pay for his haircuts! Pretty cute, you got a lot of laughs out of it.
I checked your teeth and the band placement. The nurses had placed the bands correctly. Those bands are pretty tricky and it does help by making it much easier if there is a second person helping to place them.
We brought you some pudding and applesauce for you to eat. We also brought you an “easy” crossword puzzle book to hopefully help pass the time.
Gma and Gpa Short are leaving for Kansas tomorrow – they were so happy to spend time with you and talk with you. Uncle Steve and Aunt Kathy are going back to Georgia tomorrow too. It was good to have them all here.

NY drug dealer arrested with crack in his pants, 7k in drug money FREE TO GO under NJ Bail Reform – Keep California Safe
“A driver was spending his birthday behind bars after an Upper Saddle River police officer found two ounces of crack stuffed down his pants and $7,000 in suspected drug proceeds in his car, authorities said Thursday. Officer Kevin McWilliams pulled the car over on northbound Route 17 for several violations at 1:30 p.m. Wednesday, Detective Lt. Edward Kane said. The driver, Marlin Turner of Saratoga County, NY, had a criminal history involving drugs, records show. Four years ago, he was arrested in Saratoga Springs by authorities who said he and an accomplice were selling thousands of dollars of cocaine, heroin and prescription drugs a week.”
As a Cricket fan, I was mildly disappointed that the Chris Martin at The Classic last night was not former Black Cap cricketer of the same name, although I was also relieved that the Coldplay lead singer hadn’t tried to branch out.
Thankfully this Chris Martin is a UK comedian and he’s here to share with us his musings on growing older in his show ‘Ol Smarty Pants’. One particular difficulty he’s faced in his 30′s is the challenge men his age have making friends from scratch. It seems this search has become as tough as the search for true love. He also shares his anxieties with us adding his own witty twist on life’s hurdles.
It’s always a nice touch when International comics have done their research into the town they are playing in. As Martin has been to the NZ International Comedy Festival a few times now he was able to make jokes that really hit the spot to this local audience, in particular pointing out the ridiculousness of our flag referendum and the many Sushi outlets available on Queen Street.
Mrs Krishnan's Party a theatrical treat worth tucking into - KUWNZKUWNZ | New Zealand Entertainment Magazine
Tags: Auckland Theatre, Auckland Theatre Review, Indian Ink, Indian Ink Theatre Company, Justin Rogers, Kalyani Nagarajan, Q Theatre, Theatre Review
Two decades in the making, Indian Ink Theatre Company have created the spiritual sequel to the wildly successful Krishnan’s Dairy and brought it home to Q theatre. Billed as a ‘joyous, life-affirming take on death, rebirth and the impact of community’ Mrs Krishnan’s Party is almost too good to share but I couldn’t recommend tucking into this theatrical treat more.
The play picks up Mrs Krishnan’s story twenty years on set during Onam, the annual Hindu festival. She reluctantly has to host the party of a lifetime after her boarder (Justin Rogers) invites a hundred audience members into the backroom of her dairy. She’s at a crossroads in her life, about to sell her dairy and uproot everything to go back to India, and now she’s got us lot to deal with.
The party goers are sat around a dining table and on benches in the dairy storeroom creating an intimate atmosphere of celebration and interaction. The seating options include ‘Party Animals’ for standing, ‘Cheeky Seats’ for bar stools and ‘Top Table’ for the bravest of audience members, who get to sit at the head of the kitchen table. But buyers beware, you’ll be expected to open a can of tomatoes or two! Don’t worry, some ‘Wallflower seats’ are provided at the back for those who are not too keen to get in on the fun of handing out outfits or pitching in with cooking the dahl.
Jacob Rajan and Justin Lewis are the masterminds behind Indian Ink’s various theatrical successes and they do it again here. With a whole twenty years between this show and its predecessor, Mrs Krishnan’s Party does in no way feel like a cash-out on previous accomplishments, but instead, it’s something entirely new and relevant in 2018. Mrs Kirshnan herself is played with heartwarming hilarity, excellently portrayed characterisation and wonderful energy by Kalyani Nagarajan.
The show is packed to the brim with original Indian flavours and serves up a trove of originality and off-beat humour to the table that’s sure to win over even those patrons further away from the action. From Lewis’ masterful direction to John Verryt’s intricate set design, the show thrives in the Q Loft space room for improvisation and audience interactions, and if you stick around afterwards you’ll get a good feed out of it too.
Altogether Mrs Krishnan’s Party has everything you could ask for from a theatrical comedy show and more – solid storytelling, expertly crafted jokes, brilliantly animated performances and even a bit of a religious history lesson.
Check out Mrs Krishnan’s Party at Q Theatre’s Loft until 2nd September before it heads off around the country and then over to the states later in the year.

Four years ago, I thought rebooting the franchise with an origin story was a silly idea. Silly me. In the hands of director/producer J.J Abrams, it has taken on a new relevance, and the second effort from Abrams, Into Darkness, is a spectacular success on all fronts.
From the opening sequence, Abrams settles into a breakneck pace, filling the screen with a rousing combination of action, effects, heart and humor that rarely lets up.
The ace up Abrams’s sleeve? His cast. These are characters ingrained into pop culture, and our emotional investment in them is rewarded. Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Karl Urban play Kirk, Spock and Bones with the mischievous twinkle of youth. Without resorting to caricature, all three actors are utterly believable as younger versions of these rogues we know so well.
They are surrounded by an able supporting cast, most notably Benedict Cumberbatch as Harrison, the deadly villain with mysterious motives and a great big Enterprise surprise.
Star Trek screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman return, joining with Damon Lindelof to script a thrilling adventure filled with multiple callbacks to previous film installments and TV episodes.
Quite simply, there isn’t much to dislike. Into Darkness is a finely crafted spectacle, all that a summer blockbuster should be. It is joyously nerdy, yet cool enough for those who wouldn’t know Nurse Chapel from Nurse Ratched. It’s funny, and true to its sci-fi roots while offering sly parallels with today’s political climate.
Next up for Abrams is a new Star Wars sequel, and fans should rest easy. Into Darkness is more proof the man knows a thing or two about making a franchise live long and prosper.

Some women choose to work, where they’re not entitled to mandatory maternity leave in our country. In fact, among the world’s 41 richest nations, the U.S. is the ONLY country that offers NO mandatory maternity leave.
What about stay-at-home moms? They often find that they lose their purpose, identity, and meaning in life.
They also find that they become financially disenfranchised; often becoming indentured servants to the primary earner in their households, namably their husbands.
When women aren’t bringing in their own money, they’re vulnerable to the decisions of the people on whom they’ve become dependent. Yes, we lose financial stability.
Here are four jobs that the “marketers” are trying to sell women on doing that aren’t bringing in the money they need to bring purpose, identity, and financial stability to their lives.
Look, I’m no stranger to seeing the shiny dollar signs when I started the Reclaim Motherhood movement back in 2014.
Today, however, without tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital to spend on advertising, it’s nearly impossible to amass an engaged following.
Currently, most mothers you know are selling something via network marketing, whether it’s beauty, skincare, or juice powders.
“According to a report that studied the business models of 350 MLMs, published on the Federal Trade Commission’s website, 99% of people who join multilevel-marketing companies lose money.” (www.qz(dot)com)
First, you have to buy these products, then you have to store them, then you have to hock them on your friends, and then you have to fulfill them. You should get paid a lot for that, right? Wrong. You’re sadly only going to make about 10% commission for all that work.
Affiliate marketing is when you sell people another person’s product and make money. It’s like the Instagrammer you know in your moms group who brings in $8k a month on a juice powder she promotes to her following.
Without an email list or following on social media, you aren’t going to make money to be an affiliate of a company’s product.
For moms who want to make money now, you need to avoid strategies that take all your time and money without an ROI!
I coach a lot of fitness instructors and yoga studios. However, I tell my fitness professionals the same thing every time: you aren’t going to make money as a fitness coach unless you’re also a MARKETER.
You see, for every yoga class or pilates course you instruct, you have to fill your room to even get a fraction of what you’d make by providing one-on-one coaching.
And the problem? You’ve had to sell twenty people to attend your class, as opposed to just one private lesson.
If you really want to make money as a health professional, provide a clear outcome for your students.
Become the diabetes expert or the back pain expert. Become a weight loss expert or peak performance coach.
It’s easy to fill a few classes for a yoga studio or local gym’s schedule, but unless you’re teaching several packed classes per day, you’re probably not making a fraction of what you’d make by branding yourself well and giving one-on-one instruction.
If you really want to break free of this vicious cycle and start finding freedom in your life’s purpose and mission, you need a real coach who’s gonna give it to you straight.
Here at Moms Wear Capes, we hired more than 30 such coaches and filmed them sharing their best secrets for something we call Superwoman School.

The Hawks clinched a playoff spot Saturday night, beating the Predators in Nashville, by a score of 5 - 4. It is now the fourth consecutive year that the franchise has done such. Not a spectacular feat, but considering what this organization was prior to this, impressive none the less. The Hawks are currently in a tie, points wise, with Detroit. The first tie breaker, Regulation / Overtime Wins, is well preserved by the Wings, so don’t get your hopes up. This game was equally exciting as it was aggravating. I’‘m not sure if I cheered or yelled at the screen more (at 2:00 AM, after getting home from work). If this game was Chinese food, it would definitely be sweet & sour.
Let’s start with the goal tending. It was Crawford (28-17-6) against the ALWAYS tough, and NHL leading victory leader (42-17-6) Riine. To try and convince any one, that in a 9 goal game, that the goalies were amazing, is going to be difficult. You had to be there, as the saying goes. Both made some truly spectacular, point blank saves. Crawford, by far, showed athletic ability, going from post to post, and a quick glove that I have not seen all year, if ever. You come to expect this from Rinne and he didn’t disappoint.
In the 1st period, Rinne robbed Bickell less than 2 minutes in. Them a Hawks Power Play (26th @ 15%) came up big. Sharp, on a centering pass, put one off a Preds d-man. (Whattaya know, it happens to other teams too) 1 - 0 Hawks. Another PP later, never got set up, with the Hawks unable to get the puck in and control it. Crawford had 2 amazing saves in this period. With 10 seconds left, the Hawks went on another PP, which would carry over into the next frame. The Hawks out shot the Preds 16-12!—That’s what I like to see.
The Hawks converted for the second time on the PP to start the 2nd period. Bolland (his 19th) from Kane. I’d like to see Davey hit the 20 mark before the season ends. This guy deserves it. The Hawks then went on a Penalty Kill. They showed the kind of aggressiveness that I like to see on this PK. It carried over to Kane scoring immediately after it was killed. Hjalmarsson with a long pass to a break away Kane, 3 - 0. Less than 2 minutes later, Stalberg showed his speed by going around a defender. He missed the cross goal stuff attempt, but followed his shot and banked it off Rinne from behind the goal line.. This was Viktor’s 20th of the year. 4 - 0 Hawks. Then the problems began. Nashville scores on their Power Play and then again less than a minute later. Now you’ve got the crowd into it and new hope for the players. The Hawks had a couple more PP’s and a carry over PK., but the score remained the same. 4 - 2, into the locker room.
More great saves on either side of the rink, opened up the 3rd period. Nashville scored less than 5 minutes in, to cut it to one. Then, a little over 7 minutes in, the Preds tied it, again on their Power Play, 4 - 4. Weber with his slap shot, did the honors. A little over a minute later, Seabrook put the Hawks up for good, 5 - 4. The Hawks held on with AGAIN, both goalies coming through big. The Hawks closed the 6 game series with a 1 - 4 - 1 record against Nashville. It’s their only losing record in the division..

I hate when people correct my grammar. Every time I say something like “conversate” or “irregardless,” or “where you been at?” or “what you hit me for?” I don’t need some smarty art telling me I made up a word or used it incorrectly, or added an unnecessary preposition. Most people don’t even know what a preposition is.
I’ve been using the English language for quite some time, I don’t know every word and how to use it but you know what I mean most of the time. Nowadays, in this email era, thee extent of people’s education is exposed more and more.
But wait, don’t worry about it, I’m on your side. I used to get annoyed by misspelled words, misplaced punctuation and sometimes typos but now I realize how much of a snob I was. Everyone didn’t go to school, and even the ones who did, didn’t pay attention in English class, and even if you paid attention, how are you supposed to remember when to use “your” or “you’re” when your in a rush? See! Even I get it wrong. Wrong or write though. It doesn’t matter.
Yes I here you, and I hear you too, the squiggly red line doesn’t always pop up, and it’s not your fault anyway. I no what there trying too do man. Its two much too right down.
If no one ever told you the correct way that a word is spelled, how wood you know? They sound alike.
But then there are the terms that maybe you should stay away from, if you haven’t done the proper research:
-I’ve never seen a statue of limitations, but I’m sure it’s a small statue compared to the statute of limitation.
-I don’t know what lip singing is, I’ve heard of lip syncing where your mouth is synchronized with audio. But if lip singing is singing with just your lips, then that must be tough.
-If you’re animate about an occurrence at work, but you mean to be adamant, don’t get mad at me and start to get all cartoon crazy.
-If you want to listen to your inner conscious and I’m boring you to a point where you become unconscience then that’s find with me.
-I like benefits, and although I would rather that they are fringe benefits over French ones, I’ll take what I can get.
-No matter how many different artsistes you like, I hope I’m one of them. Well I know I’m not anymore.
I feel like most shit is common sense. I mean damn, you got a brain use the motherfucker. Common sense tells you a whole lot, if it don’t look right, it probably ain’t right. But then again just cause the shit comes easy to me, doesn’t mean it’s that way for everyone. I don’t know.

After being off from the band for a couple of months, going through a surgery, and also been through a tough time with my girlfriend that got a Stroke recently, i am now getting back on track and are now preparing myself for Pain 2012 shows. It is only a few weeks left until we kick off this years first shows, and as the guitar freak i am i need to go through my weapons of choice this year again...
You may have seen several different guitars from my colection on stage with Pain during the years, but i kept coming back to a few favourites all the time (the RR1, the Bond and the Tuck). The one's that got that feeling you know. Almost all my guitars are Jackson Rhoads, and i belive they are the coolest piece of metal gear you can find on this planet. This year i think i have found a new favourite: Jackson have released a new series called the X-Series, so my latest Rhoads are from the new X-Series and i have decided to bring them on the road this year. They have that same great feeling as many other Rhoads i have, and as i have Rhoads made in both America and Japan, these feels almost like any of the others - which is great considering where they are made... I also like the new color "Transparent Black" which i have never seen on a Rhoads before. Now they only have to make a red one and i have no more guitar-dreams left.
The only thing i always have to do is a few adjustments to make my guitars fit my taste of sound as well as the Pain tuning. I always change micophones to EMG-81 (bridge position) and EMG-85 (neck position) if the guitar doesn't already have that. That also includes all electronics in the guitar, such as connector, volume controls and active battery-powered circuits. Then i change the controls from Volume/Tone/Tone to Volume/Volume/nothing (disconnecting the tone control!). Then i install Strap Locks and finally make the adjustments and setups needed for my crazy tuning and 013-056 Dunlop strings. I am not skilled anough to do this (and i am also way too lazy) so i am not doing this myself... Danne or Peter at Deluxe Music in Stockholm is helping out here and always do a great job!
Anyway, i am looking forward to this years Pain adventures and there are many cool things coming up i can assure you. But for now, this is what you get. I'll be back.

So our Company wanted to build a Timeline. One that shows our projects throughout the years, decades even. One that is sleek, modern and responsive. We’re already running WordPress, and have Bootstrap installed. So this shouldn’t be too bad. It turns out – it was a pretty fun project to build.
Our in house designers are responsible for the design of this page. It’s a little bit of Facebook’s original timeline layout – but a lot simpler and minimalist. Here is a preview of how it looks:
In a nutshell, this is what we’re going to accomplish: We’re going to use custom post types (CPT) for each entry in the Timeline. We’re grabbing them via JavaScript – using the WP Rest API as the endpoint. We’re also using Boostrap’s grid system – so our timeline behaves well in mobile.
We are going to build everything as part of the theme. For more advanced users – you can also build it as a plugin.
Note that you have to be familiar with WordPress, PHP and Front end to follow. There is no download for this – you simply have to follow along.
First off, let’s take care of the data. We need to register the CPT with WordPress and make sure we have the right custom fields. Actually, we only have one custom field necessary – and that is the year. The year is what the timeline is sorted by (newest to oldest).
Above, we’re simply creating our CPT called “Timeline”. We’re setting up the labels, what it supports and what it doesn’t support. Upon logging in you should see a “Timeline” in your admin area.
Now for the custom fields – you can easily add this the default way according to WordPress. In my case, I wanted to make it easier for the users to update – so I’m using this plugin called “Meta Box“. Our custom field is now easier to set up and become much cleaner to the users.
If you have MetaBox installed, adding the field is as simple as below. This goes into your functions.php.
So as you’re following along, go ahead and add several timelines and make sure these fields are filled out.
Before we can call our Timelines through REST, we have to do some setup. Still in functions.php, add the code below:
So the above makes the ‘timeline’ available as and endpoint in REST. Also, we’re adding the ‘timeline_year’ as a property in the response. To find out more about WP REST API, check their documentation.
Now, when you hit the endpoint: YOURURL +’/wp-json/wp/v2/timeline?_embed&per_page=100‘, you should now see data as a JSON string. This is enough for us to work with in our Front End. Let’s go do that now.
As you can see, we’re using the Bootstrap col classes to make each item responsive. We’re also using pull classes – so the alternate item will be pulled to the left.
The above markup simply holds the timelines together. It also has the text “Getting Items” – which acts as our loader – until our AJAX call completes. Also, we have a “show more” button – so that when clicked – the rest of the items appear in the bottom.
This is where we pull the data from our REST endpoint, and pass it on to the handlebars templates that we’ve created. We also need additional logic – specifically grouping the decades together to build the scroller.
Now that we have our objects in place, remove the console.log() line that we have. We have 2 TODOS: functions that we haven’t built yet, namely compileTemplates() and bindDecadeScroller(). You can guess what both of them do.
The above simply compiles the JSON data and hands it over to our templates. This alone should get our views going. But don’t refresh the browser yet. There are plenty of logic that still needs to happen. Notice the new function in line 4 called “buildTimeline()“. On top of that, we have Handlebar helpers that we haven’t registered – so the browser will actually throw a fit. This will be covered in the section below “View Helpers“.
Okay this is the meat of our logic. We’re trying to grab all of the years in our timelines. And from each of those years, we need to calculate the decade, take out the duplicates and stuff them back to a final array, grouped by decade.
In lines 31-34 is where we calculate the decade, then stuffing it to a new property called “timeline_year_decade“. Then we’re doing a couple more loops to remove duplicates, sort and create a clean “decades” array – which we need for our final loop in lines 66-75.
Now we have to do add more scripting to determine additional classes that makes our timeline look the way it does.
In case you haven’t noticed, our templates are sprinkled with helpers for handlebars. Let’s register those helpers now.
The above are view helpers – that cooperates with the HTML templates that we just built. For instance, the “leftOrRight” helper – determines if a class of “left” or “right” is to be added. Below are the images for that:
Finally, the styles that make our timeline look good. I’m not going to walk through what each style does. I’m just going to add this as a reference for you to plugin. You might have a different style depending on your preference.
After our helpers apply the classes, our CSS and images in place – Boostrap will take care of the rest. If you refresh, you should see your timeline. Inspect and you see our classes applied.
This should have a smooth animating effect when you click on the decades on the scroller. Note that our timelines are grouped by decades, encapsulated in a DIV with the ID – of the decade. So when our scroller is cicked – it has the ID of the DIV in it’s href attribute. So technically, even without our animation – it will know where to focus naturally.
And there you have it. We’ve just build a pretty cool timeline – grouped by decades, with a scroller that focuses on the decade when clicked. This is also responsive – so it looks real good in a mobile device. Note that this is a pretty basic timeline – which you can greatly enhance by adding other things. For example, you can add a modal for more details for each of the item. Or even multiple images per item – one that you can scroll left to right like a slideshow. There are many possibilities.
It has been such a busy summer. Three months we have been back and yet I don’t know where the time has gone. It’s been wonderful to catch up with people while we’ve been in the UK, and for everyone we have failed to see – apologies – we’ll make the time when we next return.
Our feet were getting really itchy and we were looking forward to getting back to Folkestone to get the tunnel (Tesco Clubcard vouchers again!) across to mainland Europe. Before we left we had three days in Taunton, an opportunity to spend some time with Auntie Margaret who was staying for a few days after Nan’s birthday, to give Bertie a wash (not a common event) and to cook dinner for Vicki and family in return for the use of their driveway and water.

Feeling like we were on possibly the shortest tour of the UK’s market towns we returned to Taunton. More celebrating was on the cards as Nan’s 90th birthday was imminent.
Nan was making the most of a fortuitous weekend Birthday with a lunch on Saturday in the medieval hall of Blackmore Farm, followed by a cream tea at home and then breakfast at Rumwell Farm Shop on the Sunday (the actual Birthday). Family had been gathered from around the country, children, grand children and great-grandchildren were present to help with the celebrations, close family friends (practically family after all) joined us in the celebrations.
Ninety Years! Trying to imagine the changes that a ninety year old has seen is almost impossible. The ability to keep up, from the point when motorisation and automation was rare to the present computerised day, is not something that should be taken lightly. Despite Nan’s protestations she has kept up with the changes well, uses her laptop regularly (a new laptop was one of her gifts), banks online and is a keen texter. She is even looking forward to getting her first smart phone now that there is one available from the fantastic Doro.
One of Nan’s gifts, a complement to her conscientiously kept diary and work in progress memoirs, was a picture album ranging from her childhood to the present day. It was handed from person to person while we enjoyed cream teas (hands were wiped clean first), with pictures taking us back to the time when Nan was a child and my great grandparents worked the land, through important weddings, family gatherings, and other events. Pictures started in black and white, until the early colour photos started to reveal things you may never have guessed from the monochrome prints, like the startlingly bright auburn of my Mum’s hair. Modern pictures may be more realistic but there is something evocative about the artificially painted quality of those colour photos.
All too soon the gathered family members dispersed and went their separate ways, mostly back to the Luton/Watford/Bedford area. Who knows, in ten years time we may be celebrating a centenary, whether I’m still blogging at that point I don’t know, but I hope that I follow in Nan’s footsteps and keep a record of my day to day life.
About 6 weeks ago we were on our way to Northumberland to spend a couple of weeks with Aaron and fiancé Kate, both of whom serve in the RAF. Now we were on our way back again to celebrate their last minute decision to tie the knot.
During the two weeks we spent with them they had shared their thoughts on their potential wedding. They didn’t want anything over the top and had been considering going abroad with close family and friends, or maybe a small wedding in the UK. We joked about them running away to get married without telling anyone. It was obvious they had been discussing their options and had lots of factors to consider, not least the armed forces rather old fashioned approach to couples (i.e. you have to be married or in a civil partnership to be considered for benefits like married quarters). Little did we know that a couple of weeks later they would have evaluated their options and decided to go ahead with a small wedding as soon as possible, although perhaps we should have seen it coming.
With Kate due to be posted abroad in mid September they didn’t have a huge window of opportunity, and so the date was set as the 1st. We were notified by WhatsApp – how else would you let your parents know that you were getting married! Paul’s suit was dusted off and I ransacked the storage unit for possible dresses and had a minor meltdown when I couldn’t find any of my nice shoes. We booked a small site in Alnwick so that we could be within walking distance (the Shepherd’s Rest was expensive for a certified site, but we were paying for convenience).
Before we made our way up North we spent a few days in Taunton with my family, this time including youngest sister (also called Kate) and her two children. Then we made the long journey north, stopping off for a night in the carpark of the Bluebell Inn near Shirley in the midlands.
After a lovely intimate wedding with plenty of good food and drink, as befits such a food obsessed couple, we followed them down to Scampton where they were picking up the keys to married quarters. A substantial but empty three bedroomed house. Our role was to be there when various deliveries arrived and help sort out the various practical needs of moving into new accommodation. A flat pack extravaganza later and their house was looking more like a home and we could leave them to enjoy it for the few days before Kate’s posting.
We are so proud of Aaron and Kate. No one can ever know what life has in store for them, but it’s always better with someone you love by your side. Here’s to the happy couple.

We took Bertie back to Tedburn St Mary and the accommodating and helpful MC services to have various repairs done to get through the MOT. As well as the steering rack and CV joint repairs we needed a few bits and pieces done including repair to the exhaust and handbrake adjustment. Bertie seems happier now, and if Bertie is happy then so are we.
Paul’s Dad took advantage of our visit to have some logs delivered to rebuild his winter log supply. A couple of hours saw us stack three tonnes of logs in one of the outbuildings. Paul and his Dad are very similar so I got lots of ‘helpful advice’ from both of them on the best log stacking technique. Let’s hope that it doesn’t fall over like some giant game of Jenga. We did such a good job of stacking logs that we were then invited to help fill bags of ice for ‘Mike the Fish’. Our reward was a roast dinner at the local pub, at OAP rates. Cheap labour.
We left Tedburn, had a quick stop in Taunton to do some chores, visit the family and get some washing done before going back down to Exmouth. We got our fix of rugby at a pre-season friendly for the Chiefs. Fingers crossed we will get to see them playing French side Castres in October.
While in Exmouth we also visited a few friends and had one day following the Exe estuary trail on our bikes, going from Exmouth into Exeter and then back out to Dawlish, before retracing our route a short distance back to Starcross where we got the foot (and cycle) ferry back to Exmouth.
We spent most of the time on the campsite in Exmouth but also tried out the parking at the Imperial Recreation ground. This is one of the designated Motorhome parking areas in Exmouth now that overnight parking is no longer allowed at the seafront. It’s a lovely spot overlooking the estuary with views of stand up paddlers, kayakers and kite surfers enjoying the calm, shallow waters of the ‘dock pond’, but I can foresee some conflicts arriving between the motorhomes and the people who use that area for water based activities (although some people combine both). At £11 for twenty four hours it’s not cheap, but there were plenty of motorhomes using it, by the Thursday the majority of vehicles were motorhomes.

Enid Blyton, author of the Famous Five books (amongst many others), was a great lover of the Dorset countryside, particularly the Isle of Purbeck and it’s main town Swanage. You can see how closely the landscape resembles the descriptions in her books, the ruined Corfe Castle, the bay at Lulworth Cove, the heathery moorland of Godlingston Heath. Any trip to the area brings back memories of reading her books. Of course when I read her books nearly 40 years ago I had no idea of the controversy that would arise over their racist, sexist and classist content, I just saw them as wonderful examples of the adventures that could be had by children who managed to escape their parents.
It hadn’t been long since our last visit to the area with my Nan, and we had promised ourselves that we would return in Bertie to do some more exploring. So when I looked on the Out and About App and found that there were three Temporary Holiday Sites in the area we knew we would be heading that way.
For anyone unfamiliar with Dorset, the Isle of Purbeck is not actually an island, but is a peninsular bordered by Poole Harbour and the River Frome to the north and the sea to the south and east. A line that runs roughly from Wool in the north, to Lulworth Bay in the south, makes up the western boundary. There are extensive firing ranges on the moorland, which are not usually used in summer or during weekends. Activity on the firing ranges can make some places inaccessible but you check up online.
We ended up spending a week on the THS near to Corfe Castle. The area is beautiful and has lots of opportunities for getting outdoors. We took two long walks, one along the chalk ridge to Studland and then to Swanage, the other south, following the Purbeck way to the coast at Chapman’s Pool and then along the coast path to Dancing Ledge. There is an excellent summer bus service that runs around the Purbeck and Poole area and we used the buses to return to the campsite after we’d worn ourselves out, waiting for the next bus was a good opportunity for a beer.
We had a bike ride on the cycle tracks across the heath, heading up to Arne nature reserve and then over to Studland. At Arne we wandered around the reserve and stopped to watch the birds wading in the shallow waters of Poole harbour from the large hide. On a separate occasion we cycled to Studland where we met with Mum and Dad, my nephews, Auntie Margaret (Mum’s best friend from her school days), her sisters, children and grandchildren. In all there were seventeen of us and we joined the throng on what little space existed at high tide. The weather didn’t promise wall to wall sunshine but was still warm enough for swimming and a bit of SUP action.
In Corfe Castle we visited the eponymous castle, bringing back memories of previous visits when Aaron was small. We wandered around the town and topped up supplies at the local shop and the bakery. The bakery seemed to be staffed with all of the local population of teenagers who spent a lot of time staring vacantly into space avoiding eye contact with customers. Our wanderings always took us through the station for the local steam railway service where we could watch the trains going too and fro. The sound of the whistle accompanied our stay in the THS, and when the final train had been put to bed in the evening we had the distant sound of firing on the ranges, and the sight of the Perseid meteors to keep us entertained.

For our final weekend in Northumberland we moved again, this time to a newly opened Temporary Holiday Site in Alnwick. This THS was quite different to the one at Beadnell, it was located at the Alnwick Rugby Club so was quite close to town and was much quieter than the one at Beadnell. I may have put my foot in it by mentioning that we’d come from Beadnell as the warden was quite uppity with us, she muttered that Beadnell THS crammed people far too close together, but we actually ended up closer to our neighbours here. Anyway, despite my faux pas, we liked it here. We had the use of the rugby club changing rooms for showers and toilets, the ladies were spotlessly clean but Paul said that the gents were a little more run down, probably an indication of the proportion of male to female rugby players. It was also possible to get electric hook up if needed.
We had a day out at Cragside, a National Trust property about 10 miles away. The bus to Cragside left from the main road near the rugby club, it doesn’t run very frequently but had services that allowed us to get there at 11 and leave at 4 which was plenty of time. The bus driver asked us what time we were planning to come back so he could look out for us, the staff on duty at the entrance to Cragside told us that the bus had occasionally missed people who were waiting at the stop and one kind gentleman said that if we missed the bus back he could give us a lift to Alnwick, but we didn’t have any issues in the end. The bus was incredibly quiet with only one other passenger on each journey. You can see why services get reduced.
Cragside was a great day out, a really interesting house and grounds. The house was built by Victorian engineer and industrialist William Armstrong, who was later given the title of Baron Armstrong. It was the first home to be lit by hydro electricity and William Armstrong was a true ‘early adopter’ installing an hydraulic lift, dumb waiter, dishwasher and other electrically operated gizmos as well as the famed lighting. Around the grounds you can see the way in which he harnessed the water to power the house and later added steam engines to supplement the power. I thought the house externally was a rather ugly Victorian mock Tudor manse, but inside there was a wealth of over the top Victorian details, massive marble inglenook fireplaces and substantial amounts of arts and crafts wood panelling, tiling and stained glass. It was all rather ostentatious, but this was offset by the interesting ‘downstairs’ rooms and the engineering details. I loved it.
Truly enormous inglenook fireplace – the internal dimensions of the ‘nook’ are not much smaller than our van!
We spent plenty of time with Aaron and Katie over the weekend, including a visit to RAF Boulmer for Family Day. This gave us the opportunity to see how they live on base; it’s very like student accommodation with a room each, shared bathrooms but no kitchen to speak of (the expectation is that they eat in the mess). They cant wait to get into a house and I cant blame them. Sadly we had to say goodbye on the Sunday evening, but we’ll be seeing them soon when they come down for Nans 90th birthday celebrations.
We managed to drive back down to Taunton in one hit on the Monday, it was a long day but we took it easy with plenty of stops and eight hours later we were back.

I have always been a fan of public transport. I didn’t learn to drive until I was in my late twenties, and that was more out of necessity for work rather than any desire to actually do any driving. Unlike many people I didn’t equate the ability to drive with any form of freedom, after all you cant read books while driving and that is a serious impediment to my liberty! I suppose it also helps that I always lived in towns within easy walking distance of amenities, had I lived in a village in the middle of nowhere things may have been different. Certainly Paul has a completely different perspective.
On our travels so far we haven’t used as much public transport as we expected, we’ve moved the motorhome to be close to the attractions we want to visit and the trailheads for walks and bike rides. It’s just part and parcel of the way we have travelled, moving every one or two days. It’s also a sign of how well the countries we have visited are set up for motorhomes, the parking areas seem to be in the right places. Now we’re in the UK we are finding ourselves spending more time in one place and a static Bertie means that we need to find a way to get out and about.
By this point we were in the Temporary Holiday Site at Annstead Farm near Beadnell. We took the plunge and moved from the campsite at £22 a night (without electric) to this THS at £8 a night. The THS was as busy as the campsite, but the wardens explained that they try not to turn anyone away; their overflow field and the ability to squeeze some of the generously sized pitches give them room to manoeuvre and still stay within the rules (minimum of 6m from the neighbouring unit). By the time we left on Friday we had been rearranged to provide a pitch for another motorhome between us and our neighbour. They started with over 100 spaces, who knows how many units were on site by the end.
From here we were able to walk the coast path in either direction and make use of the excellent X18 bus that runs along the coast between Newcastle and Berwick-upon-Tweed. The bus comes with a bit of tourist commentary, and kept us entertained as it pointed out key sights along the route.
On our walks we visited Long Nanny, the location of a breeding colony of Little and Artic Terns. The beach is closed off and a community of volunteers and naturalists live on-site during the breeding season. Sadly this year hasn’t been a good one for the Little Terns whose nests were almost wiped out by a storm earlier in the year. We spent a little while talking to one of the rangers who explained how they raise the nests off the ground to try and protect them from high tides and storms. While the parents are away, each nest is painstakingly removed from the ground, boxes full of sand and shingle are then placed over the nest site and the nest is reconstructed on top. By the time the parent birds return it all looks the same as when they left – just a foot higher. All the time we are talking the more successful arctic terns are noisily wheeling around overhead, readying themselves for their migration.
Dunstanburgh Castle sits on an outcrop of rock looking out over the surrounding farmland and sea. It’s one of those evocative ruined castles, sufficiently intact to clamber about in the towers or the remains of the bailey walls. We used our NT membership to visit for free and ate our lunch while watching children running around with wooden swords playing at being knights. You could tell that the school holidays had started. There are plenty of other castles around but we chose to view Bamburgh Castle and Alnwick Castle from the outside rather than pay the entry fees. I’m sure we’ll be up this way again.
Craster was the furthest south that we managed to walk in one hit, famous for it’s kippers, the smell of smoke and fish wafts through the village. It’s much nicer than it sounds. We visit a number of other pretty villages on our explorations, Embleton Newton-by-the-Sea, Seahouses, Beadnell and Bamburgh are all attractive places, but Craster is our favourite and we can sit and watch the harbour for hours.
We ended the week being treated to a slap up meal by Aaron and Katie, we indulge our love of seafood with a couple of massive seafood platters at The Old Boathouse in Amble. It’s a wonderful meal and food wins this contest – we have to take home the smoked salmon for lunch the next day.

It has been seven months since we last saw our son Aaron, when he came out to visit us in Spain just before Christmas. Since then he has got engaged to his girlfriend Katie and they have both been living at RAF Boulmer in Northumberland. Paul and I are both rather excited to be going up for a visit, it’s a stunning part of the country, but one that we only skirted while we were on the UK part of our travels last year.
It’s a long old drive from Devon to the North East, especially in a machine as sedate as Bertie, so we gave ourselves permission to stop en-route. We ended up stopping on the edge of the North York Moors in the town of Helmsley, it’s one of those rare examples of a town that has designated motorhome parking, albeit with no facilities. We divert off of the A1 and follow the A170 eastwards, wondering if we should follow the diversion for caravans and HGVs. By the time we made a decision we were already climbing the steep switchback of Sutton Bank, at one point a 25% climb. Bertie made it, but was close to pushing the car in front up the hill as we tried to maintain momentum. Paul was not happy with the car in front who decided to take the hill in 1st gear at about 5mph, there was a lot of muttering coming from the driver’s seat. If we had stopped there is little chance we would have managed to start again, except by rolling backwards down the hill. We made a note to take the diversion if we came this way in future.
Helmsley in an attractive Yorkshire market town with a ruined castle and market square and many stone buildings glowing a warm gold in the glorious sunshine. We stretch our legs with a walk around the town and surrounding footpaths. It has the sort of shopping that is great for passing the time, more tourist oriented than practical, but we do manage to pick up some bits for our tea in the local co-op. Our night passed incredibly peacefully in the car park and we wake feeling more refreshed than we have for some time.
The following morning we stopped for fuel and shopping before moving onto Beadnell Bay where we had our initial three nights booked in at the Caravan and Camping Club site. It’s a busy site with a long queue of caravans and motorhomes waiting for the 1pm opening time. We booked our first few nights here because of a slight, and unfounded, nervousness about getting a space on the nearby Temporary Holiday Site (THS). It is a pretty bog standard campsite which has the benefit of a good position just across the road from a long dune-backed beach and a short distance away from Beadnell to the south and Seahouses to the north. There is also a food stand which does reasonably priced breakfasts and fish and chip suppers, we didn’t manage to sample any ourselves but looked with yearning at the huge and crispy portions of battered fish.
However we don’t go hungry as Aaron and Katie both love to eat. Being young and fit they can afford to and we spend the next few days feeling permanently stuffed as we tried to keep up with them. We wore off some of the calories with walks to see the countryside and coast that Northumberland have to offer. We visit Beadnell and Seahouses, where the number of fish and chip restaurants beggars belief and where we see dolphins frolicking just outside the harbour. We walk around the island of Lindesfarne with the eerie keening of the seal colony a constant background noise, and we venture into Alnwick (which I have to constantly remind myself is pronounced Annick) to see a small parade, part of the RAF 100 celebrations. After our trip to Alnwick, Aaron and Katie give us a lesson in Sushi making and we get carried away making maki rolls of various flavours.
A long time ago, in a land far far away (well, Spain) we had a bit of an issue with our steering. When adjusting our tracking the mechanic managed to break the adjustment arm and ended up welding it in place.
As we had just shelled out for new front tyres we didn’t want to be driving long distances without checking our tracking again, plus we wanted to get the temporary weld upgraded to a proper fix, so we booked Bertie into our usual garage to get it sorted out. We dropped Bertie off at the garage and Paul’s parents picked us up and took us back to Tedburn St Mary where we would spend the next couple of nights.
Frustratingly it was two days later that the garage told us they couldn’t fit Bertie on the ramps, something that should have been evident as soon as they saw the vehicle. With a long drive to Northumberland planned we were not best pleased and set about looking for an alternative garage who could fit us in at short notice and at least adjust the tracking, even if they couldn’t fully fix the steering before our trip up north.
Paul’s Dad to the rescue, he mentioned a garage down the road from their house who serviced farm machinery and commercial vehicles, they were bound to be able to fit us on their ramps. Could they fit us in to do the work?
In the end they nudged the tracking towards acceptable, but couldn’t fit us in until August. So after bidding Paul’s parents farewell we set off towards Northumberland, hoping that we weren’t doing too much damage to the tyres on the way.
After our time in Taunton we picked up Bertie from storage and took the short drive to Exmouth, settling ourselves on a good value campsite with fantastic views across Lympstone and the Exe estuary. Exmouth was our home for 17 years and we were excited to be going back to see our friends in the town.
In between all of the social activity we took the opportunity of the long dry spell to remove and re-seal our roof light. The leak from our roof has been a constant irritation since we got the van, but every time we’ve been somewhere appropriate to fix it the weather has been too wet. We have learned to park with our nose pointing slightly downhill so that water runs off of us rather than into us, but even so we sometimes find ourselves caught out. Usually the resulting drips end up in one of my trainers. Only one, and if I’m lucky I realise what’s happened before I put it on. Mostly I end up with a wet foot.
After a quick chat to get permission from the campsite owner (who happened to work in the electrical industry so had plenty in common with Paul, including knowing a lot of the same people) Paul set to work.
Removing the REMIstar roof light was a lot easier than envisaged. The internal trim came off easily once the screws were removed and the electrics were disconnected. The main part of the unit was held on with two large screws and angle brackets and despite concerns that we might need brute force to prise it off, it lifted out with no problems, leaving sealant on the roof but none on the unit itself.
I was getting ready to go out for lunch so played no part in the process apart from making encouraging noises every time Paul showed me something. It was definitely a one-man job, I’m sure I would have just been in the way.
When the unit had been lifted off it was easy to see why we had a leak, the sealant was not one continuous line but must have been ‘blobbed’ on and there were three largish gaps along the front edge of the rooflight. Although it was highly frustrating to see the shoddy workmanship, it was pretty pleasing to find an obvious problem that would be easy to resolve. We were pleased that we couldn’t see any evidence of water ingress between the layers of material in the roof, the recent dry weather had done it’s job.
The hard work for Paul was cleaning the roof of all the old sealant so that he could re-seal with confidence. Some gentle scraping with a super sharp scraper and a bit of final cleaning left that section of roof brighter and whiter than the rest.
We re-sealed with Skiaflex 221 as recommended by our local motorhome repair shop; it remains permanently elastic so allows for the movement of the roof, something that is particularly important to us as we keep the kayak on the roof and getting it off and on definitely creates a bit of flex. If you read up on-line there is a lot of disagreement as to the best sealant to use, but there are two things everyone agrees on; don’t use a setting adhesive and don’t use silicone.
The prolonged spell of hot dry weather meant that we didn’t see the results until two weeks later. Happily we can report that the we had no water ingress during the thunderstorms that hit the country last weekend.
Our sensation of returning home when we were on the ferry back to the UK was mostly the anticipation of the familiar (we had two KFC meals on the way back to Taunton – don’t judge us!) and the excitement of seeing the people we’ve missed.
It got us thinking; what is home?. Is it our current residential address? Is it the house we have lived for ten years but is now occupied by tenants? Is it Bertie, our motorhome? We didn’t have an answer but we know now that it isn’t about physical location, it’s a combination of the way it makes us feel (secure and comfortable), the activities we undertake (mundane day to day things associated with just living) and the people who matter to us.
Since returning ‘home’ we’d had two short breaks while Bertie was in storage, and Paul was heading out on a third; a fishing trip to Alderney with his Dad. This is an annual boys trip with various family members (depending on who’s available) and other keen fishermen. It involves an early start and so Paul decided to take the train down to Exmouth where he would stay with friends before setting out at an unmentionable hour the following morning. Only an hour later and he was back, the departure date having been put back by 24 hours. The following day he finally made it.
With Paul away I spent some quality time with my parents and sister Vicki’s family and got on with making appointments; dentist, optician, chiropractor (for Paul) and most importantly hair. Because I’m a bit of a wimp I had avoided having a haircut while abroad, hairdressers can be intimidating enough without the addition of communication challenges. So I had eight months worth of straw like sun, heat and cold damaged hair that desperately needed to be removed. There is nothing quite like the feeling when long hair is reduced to something that exposes the neck. I’m sure it only weighed a few grams but I felt a stone lighter!

In September my Nan will turn 90. As an advance birthday treat we took her away for a short break to Dorset. A trip in Bertie would have been great but Nan would have had difficulty accessing the over cab bed, so instead we booked a cottage and based ourselves near Wool.
We left Bertie in storage and for transport we hired a car using our Tesco clubcard vouchers. We had a wonderful three days enjoying outings in the area. Here are a few photos of the places we visited.
On our first night back in Taunton we stayed on a local campsite. Tanpit’s Farm is our favourite campsite near Taunton. It’s in a great location on the canal, allowing us to easily get into town and is a great price at £10 without electric. We also like the setting in an orchard between apple trees festooned with mistletoe; rabbits, geese and peacocks all roam around the area. Fresh eggs are on sale and, of course, they sell cider.
A night in the campsite allowed us to sort out Bertie ready for a couple of weeks in storage while we stayed at our official home in Taunton. All available bags were put to use to transfer clothes and others essentials from Bertie, who has been our home for the last year, into the brick-and-mortar house. In a couple of weeks we’ll be doing the same in reverse and hopefully it will still all fit.
Once all had been unloaded we dropped Bertie off and cycled back to the house, wondering how it was going to feel to have so much space to knock about in. It didn’t take us long to adapt, but we’re very sure now that we won’t need a big house when we get back from our travels.
We spent our first few days catching up with the family that live in Taunton, doing lots of washing and complaining about how hot it was. We came back to the UK in summer because we expected it to be cooler than the continent. But we seem to have arrived in the middle of a heatwave!

It took a bit of google action to discover that the song ‘Nel blu dipinto di blu’ was that song. We had been prompted into a google search after seeing a statue of Domenico Modugno, Polignano a Mare’s most famous son, standing with arms outstretched on the promenade. After hearing it once it became a bit of an ear worm and we caught ourselves singing ‘Volare ooh oh, Cantare oh-oh-oh-oh’ while wandering round town. We weren’t the only ones.
Polignano had been a good choice of venue for a short break, we had a lovely little apartment just outside the old town, with a sunny and safe terrace and bedrooms with vaulted stone ceilings like little caves. The town doesn’t have any distinctive tourist attractions, but it does have a pretty little old town that is almost entirely given over to tourism and a very attractive cove of a beach that must be hell in high season. The majority of the seafront is a low cliff ten or so meters above sea level where they hold Red Bull cliff diving competitions. We only saw a couple of lads taking the plunge while we were there, the water was cold and deep and the air temperature not yet warm enough to entice sane people in for more than a paddle.
It’s the type of place that is busy throughout the year, so restaurants and gelataria were open for business. There were people of all nationalities, including quite a few British families, enjoying their Easter holidays here. We spent time on the beach, paddling in the cool sea, climbing onto the cliffs to get sight of the fish swimming below us and clambering over the clifftop limestone spotting lizards. We ate pizza and pasta, creamy soft burrata and lots of ice cream (Bella Blu was our favourite place for gelato). We drank the non-regional but very easy drinking Lambrusco. We wandered out in the early evening to spot bats flitting around the lampposts and fisherman setting out with bright lights for catching squid. Between times we relaxed in the apartment, talking, reading, and listening to the kids playing ‘the shopping game’.
Not far from Polignano we found a great beach near the Abbazio di San Vito where there were shallow rockpools hewn from the rocks just right for little ones to explore, turning over every available rock to look for fish, crabs and shrimp. Locals were buying plates of freshly opened sea urchins from a table set up outside the abbey but we didn’t find any underfoot.
A bit further away we visited Alberobello to see the Trulli houses; constructed from limestone these dry stone walled, single roomed and conical roofed buildings looked like something from a fairytale. We ran the gauntlet of cheap tat and slightly more upmarket ‘gourmet’ gifts for sale along the streets of this intensely tourist town, but with children in tow we couldn’t avoid it completely and two not-irritating-at-all whistles were purchased. Uncle Paul used his grumpy face to successfully forbid any playing of whistles in the car.
All too soon we had to take everyone back to the airport. The car was dropped off and help was obtained from tourist information to phone Parcheggio Il Pinguino and get picked up and returned to Bertie.
That night we were back in Bertie again and normal service resumed. You might have heard us humming ‘Volare ooh oh, Cantare oh-oh-oh-oh’ one more time.
We were very, very excited because today was the day my sister and her two bambini were due to arrive to join us for a short break.
But we were also a little apprehensive because we had a few things to sort out before picking them up from the airport at 9pm that evening. Would all the logistics fall into place?
The plan was that we would stay over in Polignano a Mare the night before arrival. Then we could pick up the keys for the apartment we would be sharing in the morning.
Parking proved a little tricky. The car park we had identified as being suitable for an overnight stop was indeed large and empty and still free. However there were signs everywhere saying that parking was forbidden from 7am – 2pm on the 8th. We didn’t want to get up that early! We learnt later that the local driving school was holding some sort of scooter lessons/tests in the car park. Another Italian motorhome had parked up anyway and the scooters worked around it. Oh to feel confident enough to ignore the signs.
So, after visiting two other unsuitable carparks in Polignano a Mare (one too expensive and the other with signs forbidding motorhomes), we spent the night of the 7th inland in a free sosta in Castellana Grotte instead. We parked with four shiny brand new lorries on the edge of an industrial area. It was one of those utilitarian sostas, nothing pretty (in fact the facilities were less than pretty), but useful for visiting the caves that make the town famous – not that we were going there.
We didn’t have to pick the keys up until 11am so we easily made it back to Polignano a Mare, parked as close as we could get to the apartment and popped to pick up the keys. It was Sunday and the town was busy with people enjoying the beautiful spring weather that had arrived.
From this point onwards the plan went pretty smoothly. We managed to do a couple of loads of washing, taking advantage of the washing machine in the apartment and the sunny terrace for drying. We did a supermarket shop to stock up with the basics and packed a couple of rucksacks and a holdall of clothes and things to leave in the apartment. Two rucksacks and a hold all may seem overkill for a four night break away from Bertie, but Paul does like to be prepared for every eventuality! Compare it to my sister who arrived with one carry-on case and one rucksack for the three of them.
It was the sort of day you spend on tenterhooks waiting for something to happen. We couldn’t settle or relax and kept running over our plans for the rest of the day, which just gave me more things to worry about. It was a relief when the time came to head off to the outskirts of Bari where we would be leaving Bertie in secure parking. Parking Il Pinguino was the only secure airport parking we had found that specifically mentioned motorhomes, so we were parking Bertie here and hiring a car for my sister’s visit. The staff at Parcheggio Il Pinguino didn’t speak much English, we only speak a few words of Italian (we had booked up via email using google translate to aid us), but we managed to get Bertie parked and the shuttle to the airport without too much difficulty, after all – why else would we be there? At the airport we picked up the keys for our hire car for the next few days (yes, a compact car was big enough, no need to have worried) and finally settled in to wait for their arrival.
It had been a long day of waiting, but everything had worked out and finally we saw them coming through the arrivals door. We were all set for a few days of family fun.

After Ronda we made our way down to the coast to meet up with Aaron and his fiancée Katie who were joining us for a few pre-Christmas days in the sun. They had booked an apartment near Fuengirola in one of the sprawling white developments that characterise much of the Costa del Sol.
We spent the night before they arrived parked down at the Playa del Castillo, taking a quick walk into Fuengirola to depress ourselves in the shadows cast by the seafront tower blocks. The parking was definitely more pleasant than the town.
It was very odd moving ourselves into the spacious apartment, we’ve become so used to our little space and the way in which have organised it to work for us. The apartment felt very poorly designed and the space unproductive. We did enjoy the sofa though and a chance to sprawl.
We spent a lot of the time with Katie and Aaron doing holiday things, going out for meals, sitting in bars and cafes by the beach and generally catching up. However we did venture further afield on one of the days to visit the Caminito del Rey, the trail that runs the length of the El Chorro gorge, with it’s two sections of aerial walkways hanging halfway up the wall of the gorge.
We cant provide any insights into getting to the walk by Motorhome as Aaron drove us in his hire car, and so much has been written about this walk that I don’t intend to describe it again except to say that it is spectacular and well worth doing.
So any pointers from us? Remember to ask if any of the party have a fear of heights (Katie hadn’t realised what she was letting herself in for), read this page when planning your visit so that you get to the arrival point at the time you have booked, don’t take walking poles or anything else that you cant fit into a rucksack (we saw one gentleman having his poles taken from him as they don’t allow them on the walk – they did offer to take them to the end point though) and leave your vanity at home – hairnets and hardhats are compulsory.
Slight trepidation about stepping onto the glass platform. The bridge in the background looks solid, but it’s deceptive – the actual crossing is a suspension bridge just behind the remains of the aqueduct you can see.
The train line runs on the opposite side of the gorge, mostly in tunnels but every now and again it pops into the open. It would be a good way to get to El Chorro to do the walk.
The original caminito was built to service the workings of the hydraulic power stations in the gorge – every now and again you can see the aqueduct, and at one point (between the two sections of aerial walkways) you walk along it.
You can see sections of the original caminito from the new path. Much of it is still in place, although the concrete is rotten and the steel girders rusted.
Memorial to three of the climbers who died on the original walkway. Although it was closed, climbers and adrenaline seekers still accessed the dangerous walkways. Plenty of climbers still use the gorge for rock climbing and we saw a couple on our visit clinging to the cliffs far above the railway line.
Near the end of the first section of the walkways. From here you could see plenty of griffon vultures wheeling above.
On the way back from the Caminito we stopped at the Castillo del la Mota because we were intrigued by it. We’re still not sure what it is; a folly, a water tower or a house? Whatever it was intended to be, it doesn’t look like it was ever finished and the construction quality was poor. We climbed to the top to see the views.

On the way south we took a small detour around the bottom of the M25 to allow us to visit friends and family who live in South London. We booked into a campsite in Surrey for the duration but didn’t end up spending much time there, Bertie must have felt abandoned, the Low Emissions Zone is not very inviting to motorhomes of a certain age.
Aaron and Kate also made their way down to London to see us before we left the UK, hopefully they will be able to use some of their leave to come and visit us while we’re away.
We had a great day with Mark and Carrie, visiting them on their home turf for the first time (they usually come to Devon) and spent the Sunday with my sister’s family enjoying a roast dinner – masterminded by Aaron – and plenty of time with our niece and nephew.
It feels very strange when we tell people we will now be away from the UK for eight or nine months, although we’ve been on the road for five months so far it has included time spent back in Devon and visiting people around the country. Once we’re on the continent that will not be possible and although we’ll be in touch regularly I know we’ll miss friends and family.

Aaron’s Graduation was a punctuation mark in our journey, the event that would free us up to travel overseas. But it wasn’t really a full stop, more of a semi colon as we had a few more people to see before we left.
Given we were in Lincolnshire for Aaron, it made sense to continue our journey down the eastern side of the UK and see the members of my family who were in the general direction of the Channel Tunnel – our chosen crossing to France mostly due to the fact that Tesco Clubcard vouchers could be used to pay for the crossing.
My Godmother, Auntie Margaret, lives in Norfolk, which was certainly on the way for us. She is Mum’s best friend from their school days and timing had worked out perfectly, it was my Birthday and Mum and Dad just happened to be visiting. Divine providence or Mum’s planning (the two are pretty much the same thing)?
We made our way down to Thetford forest, with a very frustrating stop off in Ely that came to nothing as parking seems was at a premium on a Saturday, and spent a night in the car park at Two Mile Bottom. Who knows what was going on that night, we closed our blinds and speculated, we have no idea whether our imaginations dreamt up anything close to reality.
We spent the next two nights at the Caravan and Motorhome Club site in Thetford Forest, a very reasonably priced club site as it doesn’t have any toilets, showers etc, just water and waste disposal and the facilities in one’s motorhome or caravan. It gave us a base to meet up with Mum, Dad and Auntie Margaret for a walk, a hefty birthday lunch at the Elveden Inn and then a birthday cream tea provided by Auntie Margaret. I was too stuffed to drink my birthday prosecco which has been saved for another day.
Birthday Haul, some of my favourite sweets, a home made Dundee cake from mum and wads of cash to spend on a new waterproof jacket. Thanks everyone x
Around all of this we gave Bertie a wash, inside and out, which left Paul aching from the continual stretch and squat of washing Bertie’s outsides. I was less achy, so when we went for a mountain biking session on the morning after my birthday Paul only managed the blue circuit but I felt the need to do the red circuit as well. Luckily there is not a mountain in sight in Thetford Forest so the red mountain biking route didn’t involve staring down an endless set of steep slopes which took away a lot of the fear factor for me. Paul’s achy legs also meant we stumped up for the parking at High Lodge in Thetford Forest – at £8 for a few hours parking it’s certainly the most expensive we’ve paid, but we have taken advantage of the Forestry Commission free car parks often enough that we didn’t feel too upset at the cost.
We had toyed with lots of different options for the next couple of days but decided to stick to Suffolk, so our overnight stop after mountain biking was at Westleton Heath near the Suffolk coast.

Our son Aaron was due to graduate as an RAF officer on 5th October so we had booked a campsite for a few days to use as a base. Wagtail Country Park is just outside Grantham in Lincolnshire, it feels like it’s in the middle of nowhere but in reality is scant minutes from the A1. Paul’s parents and Aaron’s Mum’s family were staying at a hotel in Grantham so we were all within a short distance of each other.
As well as the graduation day itself, full of pomp and ceremony, our time was spent catching up with Paul’s parents and spending time with Aaron and his fiancé Kate who is also in the RAF.
We were incredibly proud of Aaron for making it through his training, showing great determination and perseverance to get to this stage. His training doesn’t end here, he now moves onto RAF Boulmer where he starts his job specific training as an Aerospace Battle Manager.

As you are probably aware, we were heading south at this point in order to attend Aaron’s passing out/graduation day at RAF Cranwell. As well as a parade and other day time activities, Aaron was very keen for us to attend the graduation ball and I just didn’t have anything to wear.
The only dress I had that was suitable for an even do oft his nature was 15 years old – the dress I had worn to my sister’s wedding. Not only was it old, but it also had a stain on it that even the dry cleaner couldn’t get out – time for a new dress. Paul was ok, he had his dinner jacket and the only item we hadn’t been able to find was his bow tie – an easy purchase to make.
You might think that the opportunity for a bit of shopping would be a delight, the problem is that shopping is one of our least favourite activities. When I do enjoy shopping, it’s rarely in Paul’s company and involves a relaxing day of window shopping without the pressure of a compulsory purchase, maybe with lunch and a glass of wine thrown in. But here we were, heading for Gateshead shopping centre without a shopping friend in sight. Plus Paul had a bad neck and back and was in one of the grumpiest moods I have seen for a long time.
As a result we shopped in record time (do I hear cynical comments about Paul’s supposed sore neck?), we had some things we needed, some things we didn’t need and some things hadn’t been found, but with no desire to prolong the activity we decided to make do. I did at least have a dress that wouldn’t embarrass me.
Once we escaped from Gateshead we made tracks for Gouthwaite Reservoir, a stop over that would allow us to visit Fountains Abbey the next day. We looked forward to going to bed, putting the day behind us and enjoying a peaceful day at Fountains Abbey.

In this review we want to tell you about the Honda Accord 2010. See photos and video of Honda Accord 2010, leave your comments about this car.
Honda it's a Japanese automaker involving in US lineup of cars such as Acura brand. Established in 1946 by Soichiro Honda, was known for motorcycles business back then. Operations in US started off in 1973, never sold cars until fuel-efficient civic arrived in 1973. Known as leader in engineering, they still make motorcycles and other equipment such as lawnmowers and generators.
By choosing to buy a car from Honda company would be the greatest choice considering performance compared to other brands like Toyota. Firstly, their base level models come with an engine of 158 horsepower with a 6 speed manual and a continuous variable of automatic transmission. Unlike Corolla that only offers 1 32 horsepower.
Since Honda Accord 2010 was introduced in USA, there have been a rise in demand on their luxurious vehicles. With that USA has created a strategy to attain the price policy whereby they mainly focus on the behaviours of the customers and quality of the product which in this case is Honda. The managers determine the number of cars sold at different prices through the help of demand schedules so as to set the prices.

Eight high-growth markets drive overall spending; but mature markets remain instrumental in the global shift towards digital consumption of entertainment and media services...
Consumers' access to entertainment and media (E&M) content and experiences is being democratized around the world by ever increasing access to the Internet and explosive growth in the ownership of smart devices. According to PwC's annual Global Entertainment and Media Outlook 2013-2017, growth in the industry will come from spending on digitally delivered media during the next five years, although most spending will continue to be on non-digital media.
In response, E&M businesses are continuing to heighten their customer insight and transform their business models to become more agile, as constant digital innovation becomes the industry's new licence to operate, the Outlook says. Overall, Outlook forecasts that global E&M spending will rise from US$1.7 trillion in 2012 to US$2.1 trillion by 2017, with a 5.6% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).
China, Brazil, India, Russia, the Middle East and North Africa, Mexico, Indonesia, and Argentina will see the most growth, nearly doubling their share of total E&M revenues by 2017 to 22% from 12% in 2008. The average CAGR for these markets is more than double that of the E&M industry as a whole. In addition, the impact of a growing middle class and increased urbanisation in these markets will help reverse the fortunes of some segments of the industry.
At the same time, more mature and technologically advanced markets within North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific, will be instrumental in driving the global shift towards digital consumption of E&M services.
As digital innovation and growth continues to dominate the E&M industry landscape, the strong momentum behind digital spending will trigger significant tipping points in many of the more mature markets of North America, Western Europe and Asia Pacific during the forecast period.
• In 2014, mobile Internet revenues, at US$259 billion, will account for over 50% of total Internet access spending, overtaking revenues from fixed-broadband. Mobile Internet spending is expected to exceed fixed broadband spending in the US and South Korea in 2013 and the UK in 2015.
• Digital E&M spending, encouraged by widespread ownership of smart devices, will constitute 44% of all spending in the mature markets by 2017, almost double the level in 2008 and up from 34% in 2012.
• Every territory is showing double digit growth in the online TV category (from a low base) with the mature markets clearly leading the way. The top 5 in 2012 were the US, the UK, Germany, France and Canada.
• The annual value of North America's electronic home video market—both pay-TV and over-the-top (OTT) streaming services—will surpass box office value for the first time in 2017. North America's electronic home video market will be US$14.78 billion in 2017 compared to box office US$13.5 billion.
• Mobile advertising is becoming a reality, with growth forecast across all regions over the next five years. A 27% CAGR will ensure mobile advertising revenues in excess of US$27 billion in 2017, representing 15% of Internet advertising revenues.
China, Brazil, India, Russia, the Middle East and North Africa, Mexico, Indonesia, and Argentina will see the most growth and will challenge the existing ranking of markets by revenue.
• While there is no change in the markets in the top 10, there is considerable reshuffling. Looking solely at consumer spending on E&M, China will rise from fifth in 2012 to third in 2017. While Brazil will reach number seven. India will surpass Australia but remain just outside the top 10 consumer spending markets.
• Brazil will surpass the UK, Canada and India in 2013 to become the third largest market for TV subscriptions (excluding licence fees). Brazil is one of the fastest growing markets for consumer spending within the subscription segment at 13% CAGR.
• When including all TV revenues, China will surpass both the UK and Japan in 2014 to reach the third spot (behind the US and Germany). China will also become the second largest TV market.
• Indonesia will be the fastest-growing TV market with 21% CAGR in revenues and a market of US$1.7 billion in 2017, while Kenya, Thailand and Vietnam also all show impressive growth (13%+ CAGR). In the mature markets of Europe, growth will generally be limited to 1-3%.
• The global trade-show business will be worth over US$36 billion in 2017, up from approximately US$29.4 billion in 2012. The US, Germany, France, the UK and Japan will again be the key markets. Following a fall in spending towards the end of the last decade, the out-of-home (OOH) advertising market will enter a sustained period of growth as spending increases from US$33.8 billion in 2012 to US$42.8 billion in 2017, a 5% CAGR, helped by innovative technologies and infrastructure improvements.
• Global newspaper publishing revenues from sales and advertising were US$164 billion in 2012, down from US$187 billion in 2008. However, after a period of decline, revenues will stabilise and remain at 2012 levels for the five-year forecast period. Continued expansion in growth markets will offset the longer-term declines in mature markets. A similar trend will also emerge in consumer magazine publishing.
"The growing affluence of a rapidly emerging middle class consumer with a propensity to spend on entertainment and media experiences -- combined with improving infrastructure in many high growth markets -- is bolstering overall growth rates in a number of key segments. Universally, E&M companies need to invest in developing and distributing content in ways that compel customers to loyalty and take advantage of their tendency to engage in sharing content experiences. This will require enhanced digital media measurement tools and business models that respond to the changing patterns of consumer behaviour" said Marcel Fenez, Global leader, Entertainment & media, PwC.
To harness growth and turn it into rising digital revenues, E&M companies of all types are evaluating their competitive advantages and redefining their positions with connected consumers. Every industry participant will need to invest in constant innovation in its products and services, its operating and business models and—most importantly—its customer experience, understanding and engagement.
Outlook findings showcase how current industry trends are impacting consumers, advertisers, content creators and digital distributors.
Over the next five years and beyond, all E&M businesses will increasingly engage with a new and more diverse global customer base, with different needs and expectations. According to this year's Outlook, a new middle class is emerging that increasingly accesses the Internet via mobile devices. Outlook predicts that Brazil, China, India and Russia alone will account for 45% of fixed-broadband subscriptions and 50% of mobile-Internet users by the end of 2017. E&M companies that profit will be those with the speed, flexibility and insight to engage an ever more diverse global base of connected consumers by delivering personalised, relevant, and indispensable content.
Over the past five years, consumers have seen an explosion in their media choices. This year's Outlook finds that this blizzard of consumption choices is creating confusion in the minds of the consumer and this extends to the legitimacy of the content they access.
PwC believes companies across the E&M industry must revisit their business and operating models. Smart and flexible distribution strategies based on consumer understanding will also help deter piracy.
Consumers increasingly want personalised experiences: their content on their chosen devices when they want it. This move to 'my media' can be seen in 'cord-cutting'where consumers abandon their pay TV subscriptions and instead access the content they want via cheaper, Internet-based content services. Although revenues from OTT services are forecast to reach just 6% of overall pay-TV revenues by 2017, operators must adapt their services to changing consumer expectations for more on-demand content. A further manifestation of 'my media' is consumers' growing use of the 'second screen'smartphones and tabletsto comment on and share the experience of TV and other content with others, often via social media.
Outlook found that advertising spending continues to migrate to new digital platforms. However, the traditional tendency to separate digital from other forms of advertising is questionable. The ability to attract advertising revenues in the future will depend on offering advertisers credible, cross-platform metrics that define and measure audience reach, engagement, and relevance.
Content creators need to get closer than ever to the behaviours and needs of connected consumers. This includes harvesting data from social media, adapting the way products are created and distributed, and embracing new business modelsincluding partnerships. The central role of content in attracting, engaging, and retaining consumers has been strengthened by the fragmentation of media choices.
The rising value of content has fired the starting-gun on an industry-wide race to acquire it. There have been several major acquisitions of content assets in recent years, as consumers' rising expectation access drives companies to focus on licensing and/or acquiring content, while developing deeper customer engagement and insights.
To ensure their content remains relevant and valuable, content companies must build new business models around five imperatives:
1. Harnessing the power of second screens exploiting connected portable devices to deepen engagement and access the primary content.
3. Bundling, in order to add value for content providers, operators and consumers including a bundle of services for a 'discounted' rate.
Tackling piracy in the connected era cannot rely just on consumer education and tighter regulation and enforcement. It means understanding consumers in order to deliver the right content to the right people, at the right time, place and pricevia the right experience. It's also vital to sign-post where the legitimate content is available.
"The old rationale of the E&M industry was to achieve complete control over the content life cycle from development through distribution. The connected consumer is the ultimate game changer—control is now in the homes and hands of E&M customers. Now E&M companies have to not only offer engaging content, but also an exceptional digital experience. This puts a tremendous burden on E&M companies of all kinds to find that ideal balance of the right content at the right price at the right time through the right medium" concluded Marcel Fenez.

SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13760 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13760/])
Arriving at the main hall, sound of a Buddhism chants gradually became louder and louder as I approached the doorstep. My sight was drawn into the interior where there stood a golden censer with a dragon sculpture as a background. A stronger scent of incense now creeping up to my nostril, all senses combined was quite an experience. I can’t help but to stand and appreciate for a while with the old Chinese architecture and the decor of Buddhist which incorporated the elements of Fung Shui.
I walked up to the sculpture of Pui Tou and bowed 3 times as a matter of respect and tradition then as I looked around there were hundreds of small sculptures which was really fascinating as each has a different expression and characteristics who represented different meaning for worshipers which I won’t go into too much details about.
The incense, the vast and curled incense dangled from the ceiling and created a site where it was rather artistic. The sun was reaching in from the roof, smoke drifting around, tried to escape to one direction altogether, the bamboo stick of the roof created shadows between sun rays. Creating this picture perfect frame shot where the sun rays were highlighted with smoke yet narrow beams of shadow shot and cut through the light. It was beautiful.
Leaving the monastery, I asked a lady which way is the peak she pointed me the right direction and I headed on. Completing my ultimate mission of the day. It seemed promising, there is still well-paved steps with fences on the side. This must be pretty easy I thought in my head and it was, I was still shaded from the sun I was so happy thinking what a nice walk this is all the way to the peak. Effortless!
I stopped at a cross point and had no idea which way to go, on my left, there was this trail leading on a rather flat path. On my right, there was this uphill trail with a few wild dogs grunting at me. Not exaggerating, but they looked like they were going to jump me and chase me back down to the monastery. Then this group of westerners started to approach and they were quite young looking, around 19-20. They had no idea where to go as well so we thought “Okay, there are wild dogs over there and they don’t look happy but there’s 9 of us we can take them. Or that way? (pointed to the left)” So we all agreed to the left, only because we didn’t want to get rabies from wild dogs attacks.
So they turned out to be missionaries from Arizona, all of them! I was pretty surprised because none of them tried to convert me and it must be a pretty interesting experience for them to visit the monastery earlier on. They were all very nice, but not very wise because some of them were hiking in jeans!!! I was amazed, because I would be dead by now and one of them ate a big mac, never drink water. I was really baffled by this missionary.
What was funny though, they all had name plates on their shirts and as I was introducing myself to them. The old habit of mine is to look at the first name of the nameplate I mean who doesn’t right? So the first person I shook hand with is called “Elder”, the second – “Elder”, the third – “Elder”. Ohhhh right I thought in my head, and I can’t help but to giggle and played it on and just greeted the others by saying “Hi” in the end.
Okay, the sweet and easy time was over, I started to have a de ja vu of the Sunset Peak hike. The trail transformed, I guess I didn’t read the sign properly which stated the difficulty of the trail ahead. The yellow railings and smooth and even steps disappeared and in exchange, we had to climb the uneven and massive rocks for the next 1 hour and 15 minutes. but we were still shaded every now and then with rocks for us to sit down and relax with few glimpse of the scenery.
After our struggles, we have arrived and I sat down at the pavilion and ate my orange. It wasn’t hot up here at all, a strong breeze of wind arrived to cool us down every now and then. I shared my stories with the missionaries as they did with theirs. We talked as we kept exploring the area where there was a telecom signal point on one side and a rocky mountain on the other. So we went up to the telecom building to check it out and it was so windy up there, much like what it would feel like if there was a typhoon.
This place was cool, but certainly didn’t make me feel safe with all these warning signs which said Danger, electric shock risk all around the premises. We went to the other side of the hill to explore the rocky area, from there you can see China, it was a hazy day but you can still see Shenzhen in the distance. I could even see IFC in Central from here, it was quite a nice viewpoint which has an 180 view of the city centers of Hong Kong.
I stayed up there for an hour to enjoy the view and solitude. But I discovered that there was a small area where it is for working out, some weights made of concrete and pull up bars. Who comes up for a workout I thought, It is quite extreme. So here I sat, looking over the city I hate and love at the same time. Thinking about the day and most importantly where is next.
"Stephen Hauptfuhr is full of surprises. First he exploded minds by making dance parties cool for shaggy rocker kids at his weekly Radio parties at Star Shoes in Hollywood. But his quiet demeanor should have been a tip-off that he had even more going on. Like the fact that he is incredibly health-conscious and likes to cook.
So much so that he’s opened Mooi, a raw-vegan catering company, which grew from monthly dinner parties he hosted at his loft. His specialties include beet fettuccine with cilantro pesto and chocolate chili tacos with marinated greens. In addition to catering, Hauptfuhr also sells his desserts at the vegetarian cafe Elf in Echo Park. (He says Alicia Silverstone is a fan of the “Snickrz” cake made with chocolate, peanut butter, caramel and nuts.)
Soon he’ll open his own cafe with Theresa Wayman from the band Warpaint. “It’s called Under the Bridge because that’s basically where it is, so to speak, on Glendale Boulevard under the bridge where Sunset crosses,” he says, making sure to point out that Wayman is the visionary behind the restaurant.
“Eventually I will have a restaurant that is a little more high-end, maybe open a few nights a week for dinner only,” he adds." via: latimesblog

Hey there! This is my 27th book recommendation list. Please note that near the end there are Amazon short links and I’ll be using them instead.
Hi, everyone! I chose this story because I wanted the story to be worthy of sharing. Take a deep breath and enter the magical cat story below.
Once upon a time, there was a cat named Maggie McRita who wanted to be different from every other cat. So she went to her cat books and read but couldn’t get any ideas.
After she finished reading, she decided to research on her cat laptop. She discovered so many ideas and she brainstormed to choose the best idea yet.
The best idea was to learn some magic and become famous. She set out for her kitten books again which were in the cat fun room.
This time she read magic cat books, so she looked at the beginner tricks. She assumed that all the magic was going to be slightly easier than her kitten chores.
She decided to do a coin trick as her first trick. She decided to do a card trick as her next magic trick at 6:00pm PDST or 9:00pm.
She practiced until bedtime and she got so good, she had a good idea. She had started to perform in front of her whole cat family.
She started performing for other cats who lived in the country and they started asking her to perform at a cat birthday party. She started getting famous during her magic tricks.
She wanted a lot of cats to help out too and she wanted a mate. Soon, she was traveling to places she had always dreamed of going.
She finally found a cat who wanted to mate with her and his name was Concertino. She fell in love but she kept on doing her magic tricks and they both had the same clever idea.
She got married to Concertino 3 months later. She and Concertino did magic tricks and traveled together to places they always dreamed of going.
They had two twin kittens named Water and Earth. As the kittens grew up, they helped with magic but they really wanted to be artists.
When they were old enough, they told the truth. Maggie wasn’t disappointed in them, she figured that was what they were up to.
So, off they went and they both found mates that were also twins. They offered to be in just one house.
So they lived in a cat mansion. The mates wanted to become artists also so Water and Earth set off to teach their mates as much as they knew.
Shortly afterward, they each had 4 babies. Meanwhile, Maggie had some health issues and she was unable to do magic during that time.
So the rest of the family helped her to do magic until she was healthy again. She went onward to doing challenging tricks.
One day while Maggie was practicing, she fell on her paw weirdly. The paw hurt so much that it was bleeding and she couldn’t get up.
So the rest of the family went to look for the cat doctor. They found her and the family told them that Maggie had hurt her ankle and come as fast as she can.
After a few seconds, the doctor arrived. The doctor told the family including Maggie that she had a broken ankle and she had to sit in a wheelchair for a few days.
Shortly afterward, she began to walk on crutches for a month. After the month had past, she walked with a rainbow walker that glittered for the rest of the year.
After the last of the year had past, she was able to walk again. She was advised not to do any advanced magic tricks that involved her paws.
She kept that warning for years to come and when her health fell for the last time, no one was able to help her at all. She slipped into a coma that lasted a few weeks and the coma kept coming back after a few weeks more.
Then the coma kept getting worse until she slept the whole time. Eventually, her breathing slowed down until it was nothing at all.
At that point, her death had struck her almost immediately and they thought that she was just holding her breath. Her whole family was completely devastated and that was only her 2nd life and they no longer did magic.
However, they remembered her for the rest of their lives. They put her in the cat Hall of Famous Cats and every cat who didn’t know her asked someone who knew her.

I read this years ago and Loved it! Great story and will need to read again soon. 2016 - Listened to the audiobook version and loved it.
...and so I was born! A man, and not a man; a life, and an un-life. Hair and lips of lustrous black, skin of parchment yellow, watery eyes of dun-colored white. The stature of a giant. A horror among men! And so my creator fled me, horrified of his creation. And so I fled my place of birth, to seek lessons amongst the human kind. My lonesome lessons learnt: man is a loving and noble creature; learning is pathway to beauty, to kindness, to fellowship. And this I also learnt: to witness what diffe ...and so I was born! A man, and not a man; a life, and an un-life. Hair and lips of lustrous black, skin of parchment yellow, watery eyes of dun-colored white. The stature of a giant. A horror among men! And so my creator fled me, horrified of his creation. And so I fled my place of birth, to seek lessons amongst the human kind. My lonesome lessons learnt: man is a loving and noble creature; learning is pathway to beauty, to kindness, to fellowship. And this I also learnt: to witness what differs, to meet what may be noble under the skin but ugly above it... is to then reject that other, to cast him out! Man is a brutal and heartless creature. And as I was rejected, I do so reject: turn from me and you shall find my cold hands, seeking some bitter warmth... O wretched creature am I! My tale is told by Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, in the loveliest and most vivid of flowing prose. A wise writer is this Mary Shelley - and at such a young age! The narrative is as three nesting Russian dolls, a thin one to contain them all, a second of weightier proportions, and a third one within - its gentle and broken heart. That inner story, the smallest, is of my youth - a life of fear, but also of learning, of growing into myself, of witnessing the beauty around me. Of spying upon the family De Lacey - their unknown son. Their own tale is one of bravery and gentleness, of humanity at its weakest and strongest, of survival. But mine is of friendship spurned, kindness returned with terror, a stark rejection, and then a house in flames. And with that burning house burned all the love within this scarcely beating un-heart... all that love, burnt clean away, never to return! The middle story is of my creator, Victor Frankenstein: spoiled child, spoiled man, dreamer, visionary, coward; the foolish instrument of his own despair. A curse upon him, and a blessing, and a curse again! The outer layer is a story of wintry landscapes, an exploration of the icy reaches and the final doom of my creator. It is as well a tale of longing: for justice and for revenge, of course... but also for a companion, for a brother who can never be found. Alas, Captain Walton, a sensitive and lonely soul... I could have been your own brother, such was the depth of our shared yearnings... O wretched are those who walk the earth alone! My father and mother both: Victor Frankenstein. Curse the man who rejects his offspring! Curse the man who seeks to forget his own creation! I was the fruit of his mind and of his labors, born rotten, and thus cast away. The tale of my maker is the tale of a parent suddenly fearful of his young, terrified of what he has wrought. It is a tale of responsibility rejected. The record of his actions are of criminal neglect, of shameful weakness, of a man who lives so much in his thoughts that the world around him crumbles, and the people in that world become abused. My wretched self most of all! And yet I am more than his cast-out son. I am the Frankenstein's shadow self: capable of the sublime, yet enacting the abominable. What is dear to him shall be mine to destroy. His precious ideals shall be the instrument of his destruction. As he would embrace his youngest brother, his dearest friend, his beloved wife... so shall I! And as his shadow self, I will follow him as he will follow me, I will lead him to his destiny, on a terrible trail he has forged himself. I shall spare him, and all others, only the faintest pity... O wretched are those who cross my path! My story is not simply one of thoughtless cruelty or hideous revenge. It is also one of beauty, and of ugliness. Behold the many descriptions of the natural world, the myriad and vivid wonders of nature, of mountain and forest and lake and ocean. There is true beauty. It is a fact upon which we three - Victor Frankenstein and Captain Walton and I - are truly of one mind. In nature there is true transcendence! But alas, it is not simply nature that is judged as beauty, or as ugliness. Inspect the story closely. Note the good fortune of the child Elizabeth, raised in squalor and then lifted into comfort. Why was she so chosen? Because of her fortunate beauty, her golden hair... so different from the children around her, who remained in poverty. A typical act for the human species: forever embracing the fair and turning away from what their eyes call foul. Terrible human nature, that judges the surface alone. Study Victor's reactions to his professors, both steeped in wisdom: one kindly and elegant in appearance, the other misshapen and coarse... his fondness for the former and his displeasure with the latter. See Victor's uncaring and hysterical flight from his own child - myself! Watch his descent into illness at the mere idea of such ugliness. Witness the family De Lacey, and their rejection of one who sought only to ease their burdens, to bring their kindness back upon them - a being who only craved love! Myself! Again and again, the pleasant surface is favored over the ill-formed; the unknown depths to remain unknowable. Foolish humans - victims of their conceits, forever enchanted by what they call beauty. Foul and petty humans - they are villains of their own making. A curse upon them! And so rejected and abandoned, I shall bring ugliness back to their doorstep. I become nemesis; and shall live forever as your deadly child, a perilous inheritance, a nightmare of your own creation... O wretched are you all!

Well, finally I read the original novel after watching infinite film adaptations, variations of the theme and even odd approaches to the topic. I was sure that I would enjoy a lot the novel but sadly, compelled to write an honest review, I have to say that barely I was able to give it a 3-star rating, that I think it's the fairest rating that I can give to the book. The original premise is astonishing, the following impact in popular culture is priceless and certainly the story "behind-of-the-scenes" of the creation of the novel is fascinating. However, the actual writing of the book is tedious, the narration style is odd and the rhythm of the story is too slow. THE GOOD The creation of life has been a subject that captured the imagination of man, along with the chance of beating death and/or getting back from the dead. Mary Shelley, the writer, was able to show an impressive premise that not only is one of the early instances of horror novels but also easily one of the first examples in science-fiction/steampunk works since the process to give "life" to The Creature is through science instead of recurring to magic or some kind or paranormal force. The socio-cultural impact of this novel has been monumental in all kind of media. Some remarkable examples are the 1931's film adaptation with Boris Karloff; the filmed sequel Bride of the Frankenstein of 1935, the 1974's fantastic parody Young Frankenstein with Gene Wilder, Mel Brooks and Peter Boyle; the 1985's twist movie The Bride with Sting and Jennifer Beals; the 1994's film adaptation with Robert De Niro; the two adaptations of Frankenweenie by Tim Burton in 1984 & 2012; and even the outstanding current TV series (2014- ) Penny Dreadful which includes this theme on its merged story. How the novel was created could be covered as a "reality TV show" nowadays: "So You Think You Write Horror: Pros versus Rookies"...watch it only here on GRTV!!! Since all began with a friendly contest, of who can write the best ghost story, between four friends: Percy Shelly (Mary's husband, a famous poet & novelist), Lord Byron (another famous poet), John Polidori and of course, Mary. And the winners are... The rookies!!! Since while Percy Shelley and Lord Byron were acomplished writers, they weren't able to come up with something to compete against Polidori's The Vampyre and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Also, there is the tale of how Mary Shelley came up with the basic idea of the book. She claimed that she had a dream showing the lab with the mad scientist giving life to a hideous creature through the power of a lightning. I won't question her version. I only want to point out the existence of an actual Frankenstein's Castle, located in a town of Germany where, besides several paranormal stories about it, there is a local rumour, that a fellow with the name of Johann Conrad Dippel was a supposed alchemist that created a monster using a bolf of lightning (Where did I heard something just like this? Where?!), even a related rumour tells that this legend was told to Mary's step-mother by none other that the very Grimm Brothers!!! (Ah? Ah?! Try to came up with a cooler legend!). However, Mary always declared that she wasn't aware of that castle and the legends tied to it. Let's take out the part of the step-mother and the Grimm Brothers. It's virtually impossible to believe that Mary Shelley never heard, in some way, about the existence of Frankenstein's Castle and the particular tale of Dippel. Without irrespecting the memory of Mary Shelley, this is just like the story of Diablo Cody, winner of an Oscar for Best "Original" Screenplay for the film Juno of 2007. The main theme of this film is about a teen pregancy. However, in 2005, there was a South Korean film titled Jenny, Juno that it was a romantic dramedy movie about teen pregnancy too. Diablo Cody declared that she never heard before of that South Korean film. Sure, because Juno is such a common name in America that it was an innocent coincidence. (By the way, Juno is the name's boyfriend in the South Korean's movie, instead of the female Juno performed by Ellen Page). American Juno and South Korean Jenny, Juno have totally different stories, different approaches to the subject and even different reactions to the event along with different endings. The only dang similarity is that both are about teen pregnancies. I am not accusing Diablo Cody of plagiarism. That's not the point. I only say that was so hard for her to admit that she watched or heard about the South Korean film and that gave her an inspiration for her own screenplay? In the same way, was so hard for Mary Shelley to admit that she got in contact in some way with the legend of Dippel and the Frankenstein's Castle and she used it as inspiration for her own original book? TIP: If you are using legends, books and/or movies as your own inspiration for your work... change the dang names!!! At least that will make harder to make the connections and even making a more plausible deniability!!! I could not understand why men who knew all about good and evil could hate and kill each other. THE BAD The writing of the book is tedious, or to be more accurate is a too slow burner that it took too much to get into the real story and even worse, once the "action" started, you have again intervals of tedium. It's indeed a roller coaster but in a bad sense, since you took too much time in the tedious way up and the moments of intensity are like split-seconds on the way down. The narration style is odd since the book begins with some letters written by a ship's captain, and the first four letters are boring filler stuff non-relevant to the actual story, and until the fifth letter the story really started. However, later of that, the narration changed to the "voice" of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, but again, our good mad scientist takes too much time to get to the point telling a lot of non-relevant boring details, even worse, it's told in the most tedious "tone of voice" that you can imagine. Without emotion or trying to entertain to the reader. The chapters of the Creature are more entertained but also, sometimes you wonder how possible is that this monster so submitted to rage and murder is able to articule so well his part of the story. So, between that the novel is slow burner, and the moments of real horror with awful deaths are so scarce and presented so quick that you can't even develop the proper emotion on that moments, I wasn't able to enjoy this book as I expected that I would. However, I can't deny the relevant place that this novel has in the history of literature and its impact in multiple ways of the spectrum. Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust?
Goodreads, Oct 20, 20__ TO Mr. Frankenstein, "Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me." Dear Frankenstein ! When your monster said these lines in the last, I asked myself also why did you behold the accomplishment of your toil on that dreary night of November ! Yes !

So ambitio Goodreads, Oct 20, 20__ TO Mr. Frankenstein, "Oh, Frankenstein! Generous and self-devoted being! What does it avail that I now ask thee to pardon me." Dear Frankenstein ! When your monster said these lines in the last, I asked myself also why did you behold the accomplishment of your toil on that dreary night of November ! Yes ! He repented ! ..But your creation did not remorse before he had urged his diabolical vengeance to such an extremity. What a wonderful man you were, Frankenstein ! So ambitious, sharp and determined. How wonderfully you created, one day, such an animated creature from lifeless matter. you became the creator that day ! What had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within your grasp. You perfectly knew then that the real elixir of life was chimera ! You felt exquisite pleasure dwelling on the recollection of your childhood, of your knowledge and invention, of your adventure, of your grief, of your fear and of your remorse. When I was listening to you, I thought of you as the most sagacious researcher of your time. But when I started listening to the evolutionary saga from the mouth of your own creation, I doubted your being the best mind of your time. The powers of learning and more explicitly of deceiving, of your creation,were far ahead of you. When a strong multiplicity of sensation seized your monster and he saw, felt,smelled and heard at the same time, I was also pressed upon by a strong light on my imaginative nerves at that very same moment. When your monster unsuccessfully tried to imitate the pleasant songs of birds, the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from him frightened me as well. From his hovel, where he lived secretly for a long time,watching cottagers, learning human emotions,name of cottagers,the language and then about slothful Asiatics, wars of Romans and stupendous genius of Grecians, I tried to recollect the beginning of my existence as if I too had learned such things in similar fashion. Your monster made me curious about the Werter's imaginations of despondency and about the high thoughts of Plutarch from whom he learned such traits ! Finally, I too felt my flesh tingled with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly, though not as rapidly as yours, every time, when your monster came out of his hide to present himself. Though you had benevolent intentions towards humankind, but how terrible it turned out to be ! “Of what a strange nature is knowledge! It clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock. I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death—a state which I feared yet did not understand" Your affectionate reader, ------------------------------------------- I loved beautiful writing of Shelley in this book. You may be aware about the story, but I think she deserves the reading of this wonderful piece of fantasy and science fiction work and when you know that she wrote this novel in her early twenties, your admiration for her writing will enhance for sure. It is written in a very unique style and I liked the way, first few letters started the story and then it was ended in a similar fashion. Multi layered narration, all perfectly synchronized with one another, makes it a nice reading experience. The natural imagery in the exploration in the North Sea region, Arctic ice and narrator's delightful and full of warmth relations with his family and friends will touch you. The portrayal of devil is extraordinarily plotted in two entirely opposite ways. Some time he will frighten you through his corpse like hideous horror and at some places you will be filled with compassion towards this wretch monster. “I endeavored to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathizing with my feelings and cheering my gloom; their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation. But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts; I was alone. I remembered Adam's supplication to his Creator. But where was mine? He had abandoned me, and in the bitterness of my heart I cursed him" So a very nice piece of work !
I don’t really know what I was expecting – though ‘more’ comes to mind. Let’s start with what I liked about this book. I liked the idea that the monster is ‘made’ a monster by the treatment he receives from humanity. He is ugly and humanity does like to punish the ugly - this is a universal truth about us that in itself is also fairly ugly. The other thing I liked was that standard ploy of gothic novels – the multiple Chinese whisper narration.

I liked the idea that the monster is ‘made’ a monster by the treatment he receives from humanity. He is ugly and humanity does like to punish the ugly - this is a universal truth about us that in itself is also fairly ugly. The other thing I liked was that standard ploy of gothic novels – the multiple Chinese whisper narration. In this the story is all written in a series of letters and then continuous prose to the sister of a sea captain who hears the story on a journey to the North Pole from Frankenstein himself, even though much of the story is also told to Frankenstein by his monster. I do like stories like this -that are like Russian Dolls – where it is hard to tell who is telling the story and just how reliable they could be as a narrator. I'm not sure I would trust anything an adventurer sea captain told me about anything - and in the end he is the only source. Unfortunately, that is about all that I did like. I would have said I know this story well before I read the book. There have been endless films made of this story – so there are elements to the story that are etched into our collective memories. It comes then as a bit of a shock that many (most) of these elements are not in the story at all. No bolts in the neck, no Igor, no organ playing – isn’t it funny how all of these are so strongly associated with the monster and the story, when none of them are in the story at all? I guess that is yet another example of the power of images. The other difference is that in films the monster is a slow moving automaton, whereas in the book he is much swifter, stronger and agile than people. Frankenstein may not have made a very good looking monster, but in every other respect he did a much better job than God did. Frankenstein is a very fast learner - he learns to speak in less than a year. And given the poverty of instruction Chomsky would really be proud! Coincidences rarely work in fiction – and while they bring delight when they happen in life, in fiction they tend to stop us in our wilful suspension of disbelief. As Frank Smith points out somewhere – we don’t find it hard to suspend disbelief, it is something we quite like to do. The problem is that this story seems to go out of its way to make us do tutting noises at the improbabilities and constantly strained plotting twists. My problem was that many of these weren’t really necessary to the story itself. You know, hint - if telling me something silly isn't going to improve the story, don't tell me something silly. I thought there were some interesting comments about the obligations Gods have to their creations. In this case the ‘god’ is the scientist. He spends most of his time swooning – it seemed the slightest problem has him rushing to his bed for months on end. A friend dies and he is almost at death's door himself. About the only things he never did was tear at either his hair or his clothes – but that is hardly high praise. I guess I’m supposed to say that in these days of genetic engineering and such this is a tale more cautionary now than when it was originally written – but I won’t say that because it is too boring and too obvious. If it is horror you want, Stephen King is much more frightening, never tells you how scared you are supposed to feel at any given moment in the story and is basically a better writer. But this is a seminal horror story, so I guess for that reason alone…
“Die ich rief, die Geister, Werd ich nun nicht los!” Goethe’s Zauberlehrling (The Sorcerer’s Apprentice) experiences a deluge of misery when he tries to imitate the magic of his master, and to set the world in motion himself. Starting out with childish and irresponsible experimental joy, he is lost until the sorcerer comes home and uses his superior magic to restore order. Frankenstein, unfortunately, does not have a superior power to rely on when he sets free a creature of his own immature image “Die ich rief, die Geister, Werd ich nun nicht los!” Goethe’s Zauberlehrling (The Sorcerer’s Apprentice) experiences a deluge of misery when he tries to imitate the magic of his master, and to set the world in motion himself. Starting out with childish and irresponsible experimental joy, he is lost until the sorcerer comes home and uses his superior magic to restore order. Frankenstein, unfortunately, does not have a superior power to rely on when he sets free a creature of his own immature image, and he fails miserably in the second stage of scientific innovation: responsible, reflective and mature behaviour towards the creation. What could be more urgently contemporary than Mary Shelley’s short ghost story, created in an environment of intellectual and literary stimulation of giant proportions, 200 years ago, and so important still? Frankenstein represents a new kind of human creator, acting alone, and driven solely by ambition to surpass other human beings in inventiveness and power, but without the love and affection that is still expressed in the Pygmalion myth that was popular in the 18th century. Pointing towards the bleak science fiction of Wells’ The Island of Dr. Moreau, it tells the story of human hubris and carelessness and its bitter consequences. When did Frankenstein fail as an inventor and human being? When he gave his creature giant proportions? When he failed to educate and nurture it? When he ran away and abandoned it? When he refused to support its need for a companion? Or when he failed to own up to his own part in the erupting violence, and did not act to stop it instead of fainting and hiding in passive, delirious illness? When he egotistically misinterpreted the creature’s vengeance to be focused only on his person alone, and not on what he had denied it: the beloved companion? When he let an innocent girl be executed for a murder he knew to have been committed by his creature? The long list of Frankenstein’s failures as a human being can be continued, and the only question that remains is how he could possibly have expected his creature to be more mature than himself? In a way, the creature actually surpassed its creator, for its first steps in the world were filled with optimistic curiosity and love. It eagerly learned the rules of the world, observed the mechanisms of language and schooled itself with admirable perseverance, to the point of being able to ask the question of the meaning of life, reflecting on the different layers of the human condition through the lens of excellent writers such as Plutarch, Goethe and Milton. Rejection and isolation were the triggers of its violence, and scarily reminiscent of the despair that drives people to revolution, according to Camus’ history of L'homme révolté. In Frankenstein’s monster, we find rebellion against a creator, and against a prejudiced and unjust society, as well as artistic rebellion against the traditional rules of creation. Out of control, miserable, lost in eternal ice, the show-down between creator and creation leaves no room for hope, except in the balanced character of the witness Walton, who sets a humane example by sacrificing his scientific ambition and dream of glory for the safety of the sailors that are dependent on him, and whose lives he cannot risk and keep a calm conscience. Absolutely glorious story! Must-read!
If you have not read the book, then you do not know Frankenstein or his monster. Certainly, there is a creature in our modern mythology which bears that name, but he bears strikingly little resemblance to the original. It is the opposite with Dracula, where, if you have seen the films, you know the story. Indeed, there is a striking similarity between nearly all the Dracula films, the same story being told over and over again: Harker, bug-eating Renfield, doting Mina, the seduction of Lucy, Dr. V If you have not read the book, then you do not know Frankenstein or his monster. Certainly, there is a creature in our modern mythology which bears that name, but he bears strikingly little resemblance to the original. It is the opposite with Dracula, where, if you have seen the films, you know the story. Indeed, there is a striking similarity between nearly all the Dracula films, the same story being told over and over again: Harker, bug-eating Renfield, doting Mina, the seduction of Lucy, Dr. Van Helsing, the sea voyage from Varna, the great decaying estate--it's all there, in both book and cultural myth. Even the lines tend to recur, as almost every retelling has some version of the famed "I never drink--wine." But think of Frankenstein's story, the moments that define it: the mountain castle, the corpse-thieving, the hunch-backed assistant, the silently shambling monster, the pitchfork-wielding mob, the burning windmill--none of these things appear in the original story. The first puzzlement comes when the story begins on a swift ship in the arctic, told in letters between the captain and his beloved sister. The structure of the story as it follows is, in many ways, not ideal. It is not streamlined, focused, or particularly believable. It seems that every picturesque cabin in the woods is inhabited by fallen nobility, that every criminal trial is undertaken on false pretenses to destroy some innocent person, that an eight-foot-tall monstrosity can live in your woodshed for a year without being noticed, and that that same monstrosity can learn to be fluent and even eloquent in both speaking and reading an unknown language merely by watching its use. The style itself is ponderous and florid, as Shelley ever is, which is fine when she has some interesting idea to communicate, but bothersome when she finds herself vacillating--which is often, since our hero, the good doctor, is constantly sitting about, thinking about what he might do next, and usually, avoiding actually doing anything. I understand the deep conflict within him, but it might have been more effective to actually see him act on some of his momentary urges before switching instead of letting it all play out in his head. But then, it's hard to think of him as the hero, anyways, since his activities tend to be so destructive to everyone around him. Sure, he is aware of this tendency--hyper-aware, really--and constantly blames himself, but he doesn't come across as especially sympathetic. The monster, on the other hand, is truly naive and hopeless, unable to change his fate though he often tries to do so, while the doctor tends to avoid doing anything that might improve the situation. There is a very Greek sense of tragedy at hand, in that we have a man who, though combined action and inaction, drives himself inevitably to utter ruin. As Edith Hamilton defines it, tragedy is a terrible event befalling someone who has such deep capacity for emotion that they are able to recognize and feel every awful moment, and Dr. Frankenstein certainly has this capacity. In fact, he seems to have an overabundance of such feeling, to the point that he spends most of his time wallowing and declaring his woe--which is not always endearing. But the tragedy remains the most interesting and engaging part of the book, overcoming the sometimes repetitive details of the story. It is an entwined tragedy, a double tragedy between the man and his creation, and it's never quite clear who is at fault, who is the villain, and who is the wretch. The roles are often traded from moment to moment, and there is no simple answer to wrap up the conflict. Of course, the classic reading of this is an exploration of the relationship between man and his universe (often personified by 'god'). As human beings, we see our lives as a narrative, ourselves as the hero, and we look for villains to blame for our short-comings. the way Shelley lets this story play out between these two entangled lives, each justifying himself and blaming the other for every hardship forces the reader to look at how he does the same thing in every day of his own life. Looking at the tale as it is presented, it is easy to read Dr. Frankenstein as the figure of 'god', the creator and authority, the author of life. We see the monster's pain and suffering and on one hand, it is all the result of his being created in the first place, and of his creator not planning well enough. But beyond that, there are also the actions and choices the monster makes that make him a monster--his own will. But I began to look at it in the opposite way: the doctor creates a monster for which he can blame all of his problems, a force which dictates every moment of his life, which causes all of his pains, which haunts him, powerful and unseen, at every moment. Frankenstein has created a god. He has made a force which can lord over him, a god which resembles man, only more powerful, indestructible, inescapable, terrible. In the end, who is the real 'modern Prometheus'? For almost the entire book, the only person who ever sees the monster is the doctor himself, and since the doctor is present for all of the killings, it isn't hard to interpret this story as the self-justification of a madman: the doctor, himself, could be doing all of the killings, causing all of the malice, and then explaining it away as the acts of a horrific creature that only he can see, that only he can speak to. However, I am not willing to carry this 'unreliable narrator' reading to its bitter end, since the story itself does not quite support it--but the fact that the monster can almost be read this way intensifies to the degree to which it is a story of two intertwined egos, each one blaming the other, like so many toxic relationships between people, or even between one half of a troubled mind and the other. But for all that the core idea of the story is strong and thought-provoking, it is still long-winded, unfocused, and repetitive. It is certainly impressive for the first novel of a nineteen-year-old, and demonstrates splendid imagination, but it does not benefit from her literary affectations. However, her style is still thoughtful and refined, unlike the halting half-measures of Stoker's small-minded Dracula , there is a great expanse here, a wide vista which well-reflects the Victorian artist's obsession with the horror of 'the sublime'.
Published first in 1818, and again in an altered form in 1831, Frankenstein at its core is a story about the breakdown of sympathy: both versions of the gothic thriller associate the source of oppressive bonds and human misery with the inability to take pity upon another body's suffering.

The novel's lush descriptions, ornate sentences, and sensational plot obscure the fact that it consists of three interwoven main narratives that all end in isolation, namely Walton's letters to his sister and the stories of Frankenstein and the monster. After listening to Frankenstein's self-centered tale, the friendless Walton loses hope in his expedition, decides to return home, and ceases to write to his sister; Frankenstein stops talking and dies, as the culmination of a life spent pursuing only his self-interest; the monster is rejected by all and left on his own. Walton and the monster fail to receive the sympathy they long for, whereas Frankenstein is incapable of thinking of anyone but himself. In each case, though, the failure to maintain a sympathetic bond with another being—intimately tied to an adverse reaction to the abnormal or marked body—leads to the character's physical or emotional death. The novel seems less about the so-called dangers of science, then, and more about the perils of social callousness, as personified in the character of Frankenstein himself.
WOW. One of the most powerful books I have ever read that speaks so much about compassion and humanity. I feel on the verge of tears, it was so moving. This is like Phantom of the Opera times a thousand. And I love POTO.

Mary Shelley’s story of Frankenstein poses less the spooky and bone-chilling tale that it has received in subsequent permutations, but rather serves more as a warning in regards to scientific exploration. The novel opens with a set of letters by Captain Robert Walton to his sister back in England. Captain Walton is travelling through the Arctic to further his scientific appetite. The captain and crew notice a large creature travelling over the ice and eventually stumble upon a nearly frozen Victor Frankenstein, who tells the story of his scientific struggles and tries to dissuade Walton from any such pursuits. From there, the narrative shifts to Frankenstein’s story, who was encouraged by his parents to explore the world of science and nature. Armed with the knowledge of the ancient natural philosophers, he takes this passion with him to university in Germany, where he is introduced to more modern ways of thinking. Grief befalls Frankenstein after his mother’s death and he turns to science to assuage him, discovering how to bring the electricity of life to that lacking its spark. Creating a being in secret, Frankenstein soon sees that it has gone horribly wrong, both the physical appearance of this eight-foot behemoth (tempered with translucent skin and pulsing veins) and the decision to play God. Frankenstein rages against his creation and flees for the city, only to return and see that the being has fled the confines of his flat. Frankenstein becomes ill and recuperates over a four-month period before returning to his native Geneva. Upon his arrival, he discovers that his younger brother has been killed. Frankenstein sees the tell-tale signs of his creation having strangled the young boy, though the crime is saddled upon a nanny and she is executed by hanging. Full of guilt, Frankenstein chases his creature and learns of the personal journey ‘he’ had over their time apart. The creature tells of how he learned the nuances of language and speech, the complexities of emotion as well as discovering of his hideous appearance. The creature vows to ruin the life of his creator unless he is gifted with a female companion. Frankenstein ponders this and promises to make one, having been threatened with more personal anguish if he fails. Frankenstein travels to the far reaches of Scotland to begin his work, eyed by the creature from afar. When Frankenstein has a final epiphany that his hands can create nothing but increased terror, he disposes with his experiment, knowing the consequences. More agony befalls Frankenstein, who seeks to destroy his creation once and for all. By the end, the story returns to Captain Walton’s ship and a dramatic set of events which solidifies the story’s underlying thread once and for all. A brilliant piece that is full of social commentary and much foreboding as it relates to science. Shelley’s original is less spooky than it is chilling for her thematic messaging. A wonderful read for those who like a good challenge. Deemed the first ever piece of science fiction, Shelley’s story tell of the downsides of playing God with human life and creation. The themes that emanate from the story at hand are numerous and thought provoking. The reader can easily get lost in the narrative and its linguistic nuances, but it is the characters and their messages that permeate the text. Victor Frankenstein and his creature prove to be two very interesting and yet contrasting characters, developed primarily through their individual narratives. Frankenstein is the bright-eyed scientific mind who seeks to alter the path of events by imbuing something of his own making with life, only to discover that thought and reality do not mesh. On the other hand, the creature tells of a struggle to find ‘himself’ and suffers through the reality beset upon him, forced to learn to adapt under the most problematic circumstances. The plethora of other characters develop and support these two, with Captain Walton playing an interesting, yet seemingly background, role in the entire narrative. The attentive reader will see that this original piece lacks the ‘Hollywood’ flavour that has been placed upon it, where crowds with torches chase the protagonists and lightning is used to jolt the creature to life from his metal bolts in the neck. Instead, it is a piece of social commentary that prefers to scare in its foreboding and provides a much more academic approach than might be suspected by the unknowing reader. I was pleased with the novel and all it had to offer. I am sure it will provide a wonderful soapbox for those who wish to open a discussion on the matter. I would welcome it. Kudos, Madam Shelley, for this wonderful piece. That you started it at the ripe age of eighteen baffles and impresses me. I will be adding this to my annual late October reading list!

The holy, glorious and right-victorious Hieromartyr Dionysius the Areopagite (also Dionysios or Denys) was baptized by Saint Paul in Athens and is numbered among the Seventy Apostles. His feast day is celebrated on October 3.
Prior to his baptism, Dionysius grew up in a notable family in Athens, attended philosophical school at home and abroad, was married and had several children, and was a member of the highest court in Greece, the Areopagus. After his conversion to the True Faith, St. Paul made him Bishop of Athens. Eventually he left his wife and children for Christ and went with St. Paul in missionary travel. He travelled to Jerusalem specifically to see the Most Holy Theotokos and writes of his encounter in one of his books. He was also present at her Dormition.
Seeing St. Paul martyred in Rome, St. Dionysius desired to be a martyr as well. He went to Gaul, along with his presbyter Rusticus and the deacon Eleutherius, to preach the Gospel to the barbarians. There his suffering was equalled only by his success in converting many pagans to Christianity.
In the year 96, St. Dionysius was seized and tortured for Christ, along with Rusticus and Eleutherius, and all three were beheaded under the reign of the Emperor Domitian. St. Dionysius' head rolled a rather long way until it came to the feet of Catula, a Christian. She honorably buried it along with his body.
Four theological works are attributed to Dionysius: The Divine Names, The Mystical Theology, The Celestial Hierarchy, and The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy, as well as eleven letters. While there were occasional questions raised regarding the true authorship of the Dionysian writings in the Middle Ages, it is Hugo Koch and Josef Stiglmayer's works (1895)[1] that definitively laid to rest the idea of tracing the texts back to the apostolic age. The scholarly consensus now identifies the corpus as the work of a fifth-century Syrian student of the pagan Neoplatonist Proclus.[2] In his introduction to Mystagogy: A Monastic Reading of Dionysius Areopagita, Orthodox Bishop Alexander (Golitzin) of Toledo writes that it is "now recognized as indefensible" that the author of the Dionysian writings could be the first century disciple of St Paul.[3] "The first clearly datable reference to the Dionysian corpus comes to us from …532…."[4] Bishop Alexander's own suggestion is that the real author of the works was the fifth-century theologian Peter the Iberian.
Pseudo-Dionysius is recognized to be "employing Neoplatonic language to elucidate Christian theological and mystical ideas."[5] Some recent Orthodox scholars (such as Frs. Georges Florovsky and John Meyendorff) have been mildly critical of the influence of the Dionysian corpus,[6] but recent defenders include Bp. (then-Igumen) Alexander, mentioned above, who sees it as a fully Christian liturgical theology,[7] and Vladimir Lossky, who sees the Dionysian interpretation of the unknowability of God as fundamental to any Christian thought and as setting the stage for the work of St. Gregory Palamas.[8] However controversial the texts in recent years[9], their theology was incorporated into the mainstream of Orthodox theology through its adoption by St. Maximus the Confessor and St. John of Damascus, who quotes Dionysius' Letter to Titus in his work On the Divine Images, a defense of icons during the iconoclastic controversies.

It is almost a pity that the story of Frankenstein is so well known because far too many people neglect to bother reading Mary Shelley’s novel under the assumption that they already know the story. This is a shame because Frankenstein is beautifully written, very dark and scary but also quite poignant. Most people have an image of Frankenstein’s Monster as a shambling massive thing with bolts on its neck, going around mumbling GAAHHH GAAAAAH!!! and snapping people’s necks because that is how he It is almost a pity that the story of Frankenstein is so well known because far too many people neglect to bother reading Mary Shelley’s novel under the assumption that they already know the story. This is a shame because Frankenstein is beautifully written, very dark and scary but also quite poignant. Most people have an image of Frankenstein’s Monster as a shambling massive thing with bolts on its neck, going around mumbling GAAHHH GAAAAAH!!! and snapping people’s necks because that is how he rolls. Some people even call the Monster “Frankenstein” which is really a faux pas as that is the name of Victor Frankenstein who created him (though if things had turned out differently and Victor had adopted The Monster as a family member then he would have been rightly called Mr. Frankenstein!). What happens to Victor’s nearest and dearest is quite horrifying even though all the violence happen “off screen” in that the Monster’s murderous rampage is not described in the narrative, the reader is only shown the final result. Somehow this makes the story even more believable and creepy. Classic illustration by Theodor von Holst, pilfered from Wikipedia The way I see it the real monster of the story is Victor, not The Monster. Imagine how things would have worked out if, instead of making a run for it when the Monster wakes up, he welcomes The Monster into the world, make him a nice cuppa tea, and help him to find a place in society. If he is really so ugly just buy him a mask and a hat or something. His reaction also seems to be illogical, while he was stitching the Monster together he must have noticed how fugly the poor thing looks, how is it that he only realizes it as the thing was waking up? How the Monster learns to speak, read and write entirely from observing some neighbors is also not quite believable, it reminds me of Tarzan figuring out how to read all by himself in Edgar Rice Burroughs’ Tarzan of the Apes; rather preposterous. That said Mary Shelly’s prose is so beautifully written I was quite willing to suspend disbelief. Victor is an obsessed mad scientist who runs away from his responsibility and in spite of advance warnings still endangered his family and friends. The Monster is surprisingly eloquent in his speech and comes across as very pitiful and poorly treated by everyone he come across; by his “father” most of all. One point he often comes back to is that he never asked to be born and that if he can not get the love he yearns for he will take revenge as a substitute: "Cursed, cursed creator! Why did I live? Why, in that instant, did I not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed.” “There is love in me the likes of which you've never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.” Poor bastard. There are myriad themes in this book, but the most salient one for me is prejudice based on physical appearances. The Monster wants to be loved and accepted can only take so many rejections and abuse before he goes berserk. Victor gave him life but denies him everything else, he is the real villain of the piece. Mary’s Shelly’s prose is lyrical to the point of being flowery at times. Besides being a morality tale Frankenstein is also a prototype science fiction book, it is amazing that it is written by the wife of a famous poet. It is a terrible shame that she did not write more novels of this kind. Children may find the language a little too flowery and the narrative does go to some very dark places. However, I would recommend this book to just about everybody else. Certainly I would like to read it again one day. Notes: • This book was “listened to” in audiobook format, nicely and graciously read by Caden Vaughn Clegg for Librivox.org (free public domain audiobooks). Thank you sir! (Download link) • Paul McGuigan, the director of Victor Frankenstein (2015), said that Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is "as dull as dishwater", what this indicates to me is that McGuigan has no understanding of subtlety or nuances. The simple fact that he made a movie based on a book he neither fully understand or respects is enough for me to avoid it like the plague. • On a similar note. The Sun (UK tabloid) accuses snowflakes of misunderstanding Frankenstein – while misunderstanding it itself. Graphic novel cover

Stephen King in his Danse Macabre novel mentions this as one of three essential horror classics, he says they are ' The Vampire (Dracula), the Werewolf (Jekyl and Hyde) and the thing with no name (Frankenstein).' The book is so much better than what the movie has tried to communicate. Dr. Victor Frankenstein, who is a brilliant scientist with an obsession tries to play God, by creating a living human being all by himself. But all does not go to plan when the creation turns out to be not quite what he wanted. Frankenstein is terrified and rejects his creation, here's where the Gothic tale becomes a true literary work of art. What follows is the tragedy of a creature created by the arrogance and ambition of one man, an ugly yet fully human being. The monster is not good nor bad he's just plain human. What he needs is affection, love and understanding. His ugliness and clumsiness presents a problem as none is willing to approach him, he scares the hell out of everybody. First, he is sad, then, he is enraged. Here's where the real monster is created by the hatred and frivolity of other humans. A true Gothic masterpiece, this novel is unforgettable for its message, its depth, and especially for its environment and mood. It is all dark, all cold, all terrifying and all moving. The true monsters are the others, not Frankenstein's creature. His wanderings around the world is a wonderful work of horror literature. Don't miss this great book written in one night by Mary Wollstonecraft, the young wife of poet Percy Shelley. Also @ webpage here An Image of the Author.

Hyundai, through its local distributor and importer Hyundai Asia Resources, has announced that it will invest the equivalent of almost 100 million dollars to build its first production plant in the Philippines (with components from abroad).
The factory, for which work has already begun, will be built in the Laguna region and will have an initial capacity of 3,000/5,000 units per year, but destined to expand to about 50,000 units over the next five years.
The Korean company aims this year to increase volumes in the Philippines by 10% to about 42 thousand cars.
A meeting to register my boy for social activities, to get out in the real world – with supports – with people his own age.
Two hours later, after painting my boy as the most horrific child ever to walk this earth (the GIRL is going to be there! THE GIRL AND MY BOY IN A SOCIAL SETTING. Fuck) to ensure that they are as prepared as possible for anything, I wearily drag myself to the car to go to yet another meeting.
Stopping home for a quick revitalising latte. And if I am brutally honest I would have killed someone for a stress relieving cigarette.
In the next meeting we talk about puberty and hormones and Boo’s tendency to shout ‘SCANDALOUS!’ when he doesn’t get his way.
Finishing up with an impromptu one on one in the carpark with his worker talking about strategies to deal with THE GIRL.
I want to shout to the world that he is fabulous and wonderful and hilarious and brave and adorable and caring and has the wickedest sense of humour in the world and PLEASE OH PLEASE CAN WE FOCUS ON THAT JUST ONCE?
But we have to focus on the negative. His awesomeness is not an issue. His awesomeness is WHY these people want to help him but it is so fucking hard when all we are focussing on is this small part of the whole.
Home again, just enough time to stare blankly into the pantry for something to eat before leaving again, and finding nothing.
Get to school and meet with his teacher. Heads up on the days meetings and strategising about how to deal with THE BOY AND THE GIRL. And he saw a new OT. She wants to work with him privately.
We wrap up the meeting and Boo and I walk to the car, where he tells me that he knows where to get the best sausage rolls in the world from, and maybe, one day, he can take me there for a treat.
Your son gets his AWESOMENESS from his mum, how could some of it not spilled down the cord during the 9 months you baked him?
To be honest, when I read your posts about Boo, even the ones where you’ve had a tough time, all I see is the love you have for him & I know these meetings would kill you. What parent wants to tear their child down but to help him this is what needs to be done. It is done out of love, not to mean. I hated it when I had to do it for my nephew, painting him in a negative light when all I wanted to do was ram down their throats how really wonderful he could be.
Hold your head high in the knowledge that your son ADORES you & wants to take you, if he can, for the worlds best sausage roll.
I’m worn out just reading about your day. So I’m sending hugs and virtual chocolate and wondering how I can stock your fridge/freezer with my homemade soup & some half-baked bread so you have something yummy to eat when you don’t know what to eat… <3
I know I should write something profound, but instead I just wanna say I’m so frickin proud of you for not grabbing a cigarette. And I obviously don’t know how to say that without sounding condescending, so apologies for that! xxx
Boo sounds all kinds of awesome. Clearly he gets this from his mother, who’s never ending love and devotion for her amazing son is awe inspiring. I know everyone loves their kids, but not everyone goes the extra second, third and fourth mile when they need to. Be proud of yourself, Kelley, you are a great mum, in a world where not everyone is.
It’s the little things they do. My nephew is the same. Even at 8 years old, he’ll say something that catches me off-guard and I’ll either be crying for love of him or laughing my fool head of. As he is the seed of my sister’s loins and has her impeccable-however-totally-accidental comedic timing, it’s usually pissing my pants laughing.
By the way… Nutella. Buy lots. It lives in the back of the pantry for such an occasion where there is “nothing to eat”.
Just once it would be great to celebrate what makes Boo so wonderful and awesome. I know how it is to have to focus on the negative so you can get what is needed. It sucks, sucks hard.
Just agreeing with the rest of the posse, what a sod of a day! But yay, Boo, way to make Mum feel better. 🙂
Any kids that attempts ‘Scandalous!’ when he doesn’t get his way is a hero in my book. I hope it gets easier for you … sounds hard. And make sure you order in some good food.
I’m sending you all the love, hugs and positive energy that you can possibly absorb because I have no idea where to find the best sausage roll in the whole world and I wouldn’t like to take that away from Boo !!!
Oh sweetheart I think of you often and need to tell you more how fucking awesome and beautiful you are.
I am going to start yelling “Scandalous!” when I don’t get my way. Because I put that in the fabulous category. Focusing on the negative has to be so wearying… 🙁
I am sending you all of my love and strength. I really don’t know how you manage to stay so amazingly awesome dealing with all of these challenges.

Six years have passed since March 11, 2011 when the catastrophic earthquake and tsunami hit the Tohoku region of Japan. How many souls were lost that day, and how many tears have been shed since then?
Industries and transportation in the devastated areas have been recovering steadily, yet more than 130,000 people still cannot return to their beloved hometowns.
As New Yorkers who live far from Japan, and who survived 9.11, what we can do for them is never to forget them.
At this 6th anniversary memorial, once again Fellowship for Japan, a coalition of Japan Relief organizations, is organizing a fundraiser including speakers with deep connections to Japan. Moderated by AK Akemi Kakihara, TOGETHER FOR 3.11 Executive Director, Fellowship for Japan, the event will also remember the people who suffered in the massive earthquake that struck the Kumamoto and Oita regions in April 2016.
Anyone can attend, including children and infants. No registration is required, and there is no dress code or admission. Organizers ask that all attendees bring a pen to write a message for the people in affected areas in Japan. There will be a card inside of the program that will be collected at the church and sent to Japan.
Fundraising items will be for sale by the entrance. All profits will be used to support relief efforts in Japan’s affected areas from the 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake and the Great East Japan Earthquake in Tohoku.

Continuing digging on a soccer field in Okinawa City where suspicious drum cans were discovered earlier last year has yielded four more drum cans buried in the area years ago.
The cans found earlier have been confirmed to have high concentration of toxic dioxin, but what they were used to store originally has not been determined unequivocally, although some suspect that they had contained defoliant Agent Orange used during the Vietnam war.
The Okinawa Defense Bureau that is in charge of cleaning the area of any contamination and is excavating the soccer field for buried items found the additional four drum cans. According to officials, one of the four cans had a hole, and brown liquid was coming out of it giving out an odor. Investigators took samples of the liquid and soil around the area and are scheduled to analyze the samples.

I’ve been a fan of CSI, in all its forms, since the very beginning. I’ve enjoyed each show as they’ve spun off from the original, but I’ve watched CSI Miami go downhill for so long now that I just can’t take it anymore. It’s a combination of things I just couldn’t take any longer: Horatio Cane’s penchant for standing sideways, appearing out of thin air, wearing his sunglasses indoors, and spouting idiotic one-liners. And poor writing that made CSI Miami into more of a wannabe cop action drama than something that relied on forensics and science.
And speaking of science and technology, all the CSI shows have gone overboard when it comes to one-upping each other with who can have the coolest animations for Codis DNA lookups. But CSI Miami somehow traveled a decade into the future and gained access to 9th generation Microsoft Surface computing workstations – you know, the ones with 120 inch wide-screen displays, the ability to place any phone on the surface and immediately pull data off of it, and 3D projection displays. It’s like each member of the special effects department working on CSI Miami takes a hit of acid before they work on an episode and they come up with increasingly crazier technologies that don’t yet exist. Every year the show gets more and more unrealistic, likely to compensate for the increasingly poor writing.

Hailed by his ex- employer Charles Mingus as one of the trumpet greats, Shaw disappeared from sight after a dispute with the bassist in 1957 and leaving his band. He re-surfaced again in 1962 and made the two excellent LPs for Argo Records, Breakthrough and Debut In Blues. The contents of both albums have been fitted onto this single CD and they prove that Mingus was right, Shaw was an exceptionally gifted jazz trumpeter. Blues drenched, always a good sign of a musician’s feeling for the music, Shaw’s solos here are exceptionally fresh and all his own. He had his own sound, a sort of soft focus but intense tone that identified him as soon as he was heard.
These two LPs were made with Shaw’s own group at the time and they play very well. None of the names will be over familiar to jazz buffs but they are all extremely competent. Born in 1926, Shaw died in 1973 having dropped out of music yet again in 1964 and made a final comeback in 1968 and received rave notices for his playing at the Hungry Eye night club in Chicago. Then he disappeared yet again and nobody seems to know where he ended up until he finally returned to California, retired from music and died on August 17th 1973.
A somewhat erratic, nomadic existence then, possibly triggered by Mingus’s mistaken ill treatment of him when he missed a record date through genuine illness. While briefly on this planet though, he played excellent modern jazz trumpet and the evidence is there to hear on this CD.
In the past the Albany Conversation Program has been provided limited funds by NSF and NIH exclusively to support the participation by outstanding and excellent young scientists, particularly graduate students. These funds could be used only to support US citizens or US permanent residents. If we receive such funds this time (we will know about it only a few days before the conference), the program will be able to provide the above support. The support that is provided covers only the registration fee, and the local expenses for meals and accommodation. Students who are qualified to receive support are reimbursed after the conference.

The company said the flaw affected almost 50 million accounts, and Facebook logged 90 million people off their accounts as a safety measure. As in any relationship between people, once a company loses the trust of its customers, there is a long, lingering period of suspicion that the company will do something egregious again.
There is suspicion that greedy banks will take on too much risk again. That Chipotle will make customers sick again.
And that Facebook is too creepy and irresponsible to be an unquestioned staple of daily life. Once trust is gone, it’s incredibly hard to win back and every misstep is magnified.
That is what is happening to Facebook on Friday after it reported it discovered a security flaw that potentially allowed attackers to hijack people’s Facebook accounts.
The company said the flaw affected almost 50 million accounts, and Facebook logged 90 million people off their accounts as a safety measure.
The company didn’t say whether anyone’s account had been hijacked by exploiting the security flaw it outlined. At least based on the available information from Facebook, the company acted quickly and responsibly once it discovered the technical vulnerbility. But then again, that doesn’t matter.
Facebook shares dropped more than 3% on the news, and it set off another round of news reports that reminded people about Cambridge Analytica, Russian propaganda, Myanmar violence and more. (Facebook lost more market value from the security flaw than Tesla lost on Friday after its CEO was sued by the government for securities fraud.)
To people already understandably weary of Facebook after two years of scandal, the combination of the words “Facebook” and “compromised data” are enough to bring up all the bad feelings about the company.
This is what the loss of faith looks like, and it’s hard to imagine Facebook winning people back anytime soon. Everyone at Facebook may believe it’s unfair that the company is being criticised at every turn, but reality bites. (Source:ETTelecom)
Microsoft’s Indian-origin CEO Satya Nadella has netted over USD 35 million after selling almost one-third of his common shares in the software giant. Nadella sold 328,000 shares in multiple trades at prices ranging from USD 109.08 to USD 109.68 as the stock trades near a record price.
The stock sale, disclosed in a regulatory filing yesterday, netted Nadella more than USD 35 million. Microsoft shares have soared 53 per cent in the past year, closing the week at USD 109. The record closing price was USD 110.83 on July 25.
Nadella, 50, still own 778,596 shares of common stock. He is required to have 15 times his base salary in stock. His annual base salary in 2017 was USD 1.45 million, and his total compensation exceeded USD 20 million. “The stock divestitures made today were for personal financial planning and diversification reasons,” a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC. “Satya is committed to the continued success of the company and his holdings significantly exceed the holding requirements set by the Microsoft board of directors,” he said.
Since Nadella took over the CEO role from Steve Ballmer in February 2014, Seattle-based Microsoft’s shares have tripled in value. He last sold shares in 2016, when the stock was worth around USD 58 per share. (Source: The Hindu BusinessLine)
Cyber security experts have noticed a spike in fileless malware attacks, which take advantage of the trust factor between security software and genuine, signed Windows applications. As these malware attacks leave no footprints in the computer system, it is difficult to notice their presence.
“Because this type of attack is launched through reputable, trusted executables, it is hard to detect,” says internet security solutions firm McAfee Labs.It says the rapid rise of such attacks is a cause for concern. Unlike in traditional attacks where hackers sneak into systems by launching malware applications, fileless malware attacks do not install any software on a user’s computer.
“This makes a successful attack extremely hard to detect. Both consumers and corporate users can fall victim. In corporate environments, attackers use this vector to move laterally through the network,” McAfee points out. Cyber security expert Debasish Mandal says CactusTorch is an example of a ‘fileless’ threat. It adopts the DotNetToJScript technique, which loads and executes malicious applications straight from memory.
“These assemblies are the smallest unit of deployment of an application, such as a .dll or .exe. The malware does not write any part of the malicious .NET assembly on a computer’s hard drive,” he says. This makes traditional file scanners ineffective in detecting the intrusions. “We have seen a rapid growth in the use of CactusTorch this year. This can execute custom shellcode on Windows systems,” he says. (Source: The Hindu BusinessLine)
Microsoft’s chief legal officer yesterday called for regulation of facial recognition technology due to the risk to privacy and human rights.
Brad Smith made a case for a government initiative to lay out rules for proper use of facial recognition technology, with input from a bipartisan and expert commission.
Facial recognition technology raises significant human rights and privacy concerns, Smith said in a blog post. “Imagine a government tracking everywhere you walked over the past month without your permission or knowledge,” he said. “Imagine a database of everyone who attended a political rally that constitutes the very essence of free speech.”
It could become possible for businesses to track visitors or customers, using what they see for decisions regarding credit scores, lending decisions, or employment opportunities without telling people. He said scenarios portrayed in fictional films such as “Minority Report”, “Enemy of the State”, and even the George Orwell dystopian classic “1984” are “on the verge of becoming possible”. “These issues heighten responsibility for tech companies that create these products,” Smith said. “In our view, they also call for thoughtful government regulation and for the development of norms around acceptable uses.”
Microsoft and other tech companies have used facial recognition technology for years for tasks such as organizing digital photographs. But the ability of computers to recognize people’s faces is improving rapidly, along with the ubiquity of cameras and the power of computing hosted in the internet cloud to figure out identities in real time.
While the technology can be used for good, perhaps finding missing children or known terrorists, it can also be abused. “It may seem unusual for a company to ask for government regulation of its products, but there are many markets where thoughtful regulation contributes to a healthier dynamic for consumers and producers alike,” Smith said. “It seems especially important to pursue thoughtful government regulation of facial recognition technology, given its broad societal ramifications and potential for abuse.”
Concerns about misuse prompted Microsoft to “move deliberately” with facial recognition consulting or contracting, according to Smith. “This has led us to turn down some customer requests for deployments of this service where we’ve concluded that there are greater human rights risks,” Smith said.

NIIT Ltd will train 20,000 students from four southern States, with employable skill sets in IT and Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) sectors.

Press Trust of India Facebook has said it shared user data with 52 companies, including Chinese firms, weeks after it was reported that the social media giant formed data-sharing partnerships with cellphone makers, giving them access to details of users and their friends.
The social media giant’s acknowledgement came as a part of a more than 700-page document to the US House Energy and Commerce Committee.
The committee released the information publicly on Saturday, The Hill reported. Facebook yesterday revealed the partnerships shedding light on its behaviour related to customer data in the wake of a scandal involving the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica, where data of 87 million people was improperly shared, it said. The list featured major tech companies such as Apple, Amazon, BlackBerry and Samsung. Other firms that featured on the list include Alibaba, Qualcomm and Pantech. But the list also includes four Chinese firms that US intelligence has flagged as national security threats — Huawei, Lenovo, Oppo and TCL.
Facebook said it shared data with the companies in an effort to improve its integrations and user experience across platforms and devices, noting that its partnerships were established before smartphones running on Apple’s and Google’s high-powered operating systems were as ubiquitous as they are now, the report said.
“People went online using a wide variety of text-only phones, feature phones, and early smartphones with varying capabilities,” Facebook wrote.
“In that environment, the demand for internet services like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube outpaced our industry’s ability to build versions of our services that worked on every phone and operating system.”
It said in documents that its initial omission of the partnerships resulted because it had shifted its focus to data-sharing between apps created on its developer platform — the product area which had been implicated by Cambridge Analytica. (Source: The Hindu BusinessLine)
The much-awaited data protection policy may soon come out as the recommendations on the draft Data Protection Bill are ready, and can be submitted to the Minister of Electronics and Information Technology, any day within this week.
An expert Committee chaired by retired Supreme Court judge BN Srikrishna has prepared the recommendations. The Committee was set up in December to study various issues relating to data protection in India and make specific suggestions on principles to be considered for data protection and suggest a draft Data Protection Bill.
The objective was to ‘ensure growth of the digital economy while keeping personal data of citizens secure and protected.’
“The recommendations (on the draft policy) are ready and the Committee has asked a time from the Minister (Ravi Shankar Prasad) so that they can further discuss issues or clarifications, if any,” a senior government official told BusinessLine.
Sources close to the development said that if there are no further discussions, the draft may soon go to the Cabinet. The recommendations come at a time when there are a lot of issues and reports around data leakage, and harvesting of data of Indian citizens by social media sites.
The government has also recently said that it will not allow “fly-by-night” data mining firms to improperly harvest social media data of Indian citizens.
It has already slapped notices to the controversial, UK-based data mining firm Cambridge Analytica for improperly obtaining information from tens of millions of Facebook users globally, including in India and is awaiting its response.
The government sent another letter to Facebook on June 6, seeking explanation of the issue of data sharing without explicit consent through its platform.
According to experts, India needs a robust data protection policy so that such incidents do not occur in the future. A firm legal framework for data protection will be the foundation on which data-driven innovation and entrepreneurship can flourish in India.
According to the white paper on Data Protection Framework for India, fostering such innovation and entrepreneurship is essential if India is to lead its citizens and the world into a digital future committed to empowerment, experiment and equal access. (Source: The Hindu BusinessLine)
Prasad said that Common Service Centre have risen from 83,000 to 2, 91,000, while 89 BPOs have started operating in various states in a matter of 2.5 years.
The Digital India programme has transformed into a "mass movement" and the government will soon finalise a new electronics policy to build on the momentum, IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said. It will also push ahead to meet the ambitious goal of increasing the size of India's digital economy to $1 trillion in the coming years. "We are soon going to finalise the new electronics policy whose sub-segment will be export-oriented initiatives in the field of electronics.
The idea is to make India a big hub of electronics manufacturing to serve domestic as well as outside markets," Prasad told PTI. In an interview, coinciding with the fourth anniversary of the Modi government, Prasad said the troika of 31 crore Jan Dhan accounts, 121 crore mobiles and biometroc identifier Aadhaar (dubbed JanDan-Aadhaar-Mobile or JAM trinity) for pushing welfare benefits and subsidies, have led to savings of Rs 90,000 crore.
"This is India for digital inclusion and if I juxtapose it on what Rajiv Gandhi had said about sending Re 1 from Delhi and 15 paise reaching on the ground ... in the Modi government Re 1 is sent and it reaches the bank account," Prasad said.
Highlighting the milestones on IT and electronics related initiatives, Prasad said that Common Service Centre have risen from 83,000 to 2,91,000, while 89 BPOs have started operating in various states in a matter of 2.5 years.
Production of mobile handsets in India too has seen an unprecedented growth, he said adding that almost 120 units manufacturing mobile handsets and components have been established in the country over the last three years.
"We will further accelerate this process and concretise the potential of India's digital economy to $1 trillion economy," Prasad said.
India is aspiring to become a $1 trillion digital economy in next few years, riding on opportunities in areas like IT and IT enabled services, e-commerce, electronics manufacturing, digital payments and cyber security.
"The common man has come to have a stake in the emerging digital ecosystem in the country," Prasad said underlining programs ranging from national scholarship portal to digital locker, and National Agriculture Market to eHospital. The government sees Digital India as being supported by "low cost technology" that is both developmental and inclusive, he added. (ETTelecom)
Midsize Indian IT services companies may post steady growth on the back of higher digital technology exposure, especially at a time when large companies are projected to have cautious forecast, said analysts. While some of the mid-cap IT firms have registered strong growth in the past couple of quarters, analysts have said they would continue to see higher revenue growth fuelled by digital deals.
“Higher digital (technology) exposure and less legacy (software maintenance, technology infrastructure management) services compared with the larger companies are really translating into higher growth,” said Apurva Prasad, IT analyst, HDFC Securities. Companies such as MindtreeNSE 0.64 %, Zensar garner more than one-third of their revenue from digital technology services.
Prasad said, while the large clients for the mid-cap IT companies are growing faster, large accounts or deals for bigger IT companies have seen enough technology disruption and many of them re-oriented technology spending to drive internal innovation.
“Large contracts for large companies are worth nearly $100-200 million unlike the large deals for mid-cap firms that are valued at $25-30 million.” “Mid-tier companies will report 2-3% constant currency revenue growth sequentially despite seasonal weakness. Growth will be buoyed with share gains in existing large clients and benefits of large deals signed in the past 6-9 months,” Kawaljeet Saluja, analyst with brokerage Kotak Institutional Equities, said in a report.
Companies such as Mindtree, NIIT Tech, Zensar and others are likely to see continued growth momentum with the exception of Persistent Systems, which had warned that a shortfall in intellectual property (IP) revenue would affect its growth and margins in the fourth quarter.
Brokerage Edelweiss Securities had noted that while a drop in IP revenue was expected because of seasonal weakness in IBM’s Alliance business, the $8-million miss is much higher than anticipated due to revenue ramp-down in one of its IP products. “Growth recovery in Mindtree (4.4% QoQ reported) and NITEC (3.4%) should continue; we expect a 4.4% QoQ decline for Persistent Systems post the recent business update citing a shortfall in IP revenues,” wrote Pankaj Kapoor and Akash Verma of JM Financial.
“The momentum is likely to remain strong in the ER&D space; we estimate organic US-dollar revenue growth of 2.3% and 6.9% for L&T Technology Services and Cyient,” Kapoor and Verma said. Shares of Mindtree, Zensar and HexawareNSE -0.80 % have risen over 20% in value over the past three months, in step with the overall rise in midcap stocks.
Analysts had said that the outlook for smaller, under-scale companies are bleak and said consolidation was the only cure. Since then, some of the companies have brought in PE backers — Zensar and Hexaware — or merged with others to create specialisation, as with KPIT and BirlaSoft. (Source: Economic Times)

Wow Cheryl, You really had me stumped here! I'm not sure if this is what you were aiming for, so let me tell you about my thought process. The words that stuck out to me in her directions, were barkcloth and curves. I googled barkcloth and came up with this:
After more searching, and many more images, I realized a commonality to all this was that the shapes were neither symmetrical or complex. Some of them stood alone, and some were embellished with lines and other shapes layered on top:
I tried here to use each fabric more than once, thinking that they would play off each other and unify the piece. I also kept my shapes rather simple... for ease of construction as well as simplicity in design. The fabrics you chose Cheryl are lovely indeed! Looking at it now, I'm thinking perhaps the black fabric should have been used for larger shapes or at least outlined with another fabric, but all in all I think these work well with each other. In the end, I'm thinking if I have time, I'll put together simpler blocks with the leftovers... smaller simpler blocks may help to offset this loud little puppy.
I'm very excited to see how the rest of you interpret Cheryl's instructions. I'm thinking this really could work because the fabrics she gave us are all related. It will be interesting to see the thought processes that went into this one. Please do comment on your trains of thought when posting your pictures! Good Luck!
I know it was hard to leave it so open ended, but I do like to push people. And with blocks like this I am very happy that I did. And very grateful for you accepting the challenge.
wow this is really inspiring. I've also found this round challenging... in such a good way. May have to give those curves a try!

30/12/2016, DIO BENEDICA L'EGITTO DI SISSI.. CHE TRA SCOSSONI E SINGULTI SEMBRA IMBOCCARE LA STRADA GIUSTA: E NESSUNO DOVREBBE DIRE CHE, IO NON PREMIO LA BUONA VOLONTÀ DEI MUSULMANI! il mio Prete è salito sull'altare con una casula che aveva, ai lati di una croce centrale: due lettere ricamate: una (ALFA) e l'altra avrebbe dovuto essere una (OMEGA) ed invece era uno scarabocchio che se non era un simbolo satanico, non significava niente! (queste sono le casule che i nostri preti vanno a comprare da negozi specializzati! ) EGITTO - STATI UNITI. Governo e cristiani contro l’ingerenza Usa nella ricostruzione di chiese distrutte dai jihadisti. Loula Lahham. CERTAMENTE GLI USA POSSONO DARE FINANZIAMENTI, PER REALIZZARE QUESTI RESTAURI, MA, NOI NON CI POSSIAMO FIDARE DELLA CIA E DEI SUOI SACERDOTI DI SATANA! [ EGYPT-US Government and Christians against US interference in Church reconstruction Loula Lahham US Congress discusses a law authorizing the supervision of the work of reconstruction of churches and buildings destroyed by Islamic extremists. 84 in total from 2013 to the present. Cairo authorities and Christian groups call the norm illegitimate form of interference. Fr. Greiche: Where was the United States when the Muslim Brotherhood burned the churches? Cairo (AsiaNews) – Days after dismantling extremist Islamic groups in Rabea and Al-Nahda, the Egyptian government – through the Foreign Ministry spokesman - has slammed a bill being considered by the US Congress to guarantee US control of the reconstruction work on dozens of churches destroyed or burned in the recent past by fundamentalists and jihadists movements in Egypt. The law therefore wants to assign the US Secretary of State supervision of the efforts made by the Egyptian government in the restoration or reconstruction of Christian buildings damaged from 2013 to today. In total there are at least 84 churches, schools and community centers belonging to various Christian denominations in Egypt, targeted by Islamic extremists. The Egyptian Foreign Ministry statement was followed by official statements from the nations Christian Churches and communities. For the Orthodox, the Egyptian government has done all it could to restore the churches, using its own funds and with the contribution of Egyptian workers. In an official statement the leaders of the community say that "President al Sisi has promised and kept his promise. Work has also already started on Boutrossiya [the church attacked last December 11], aided by engineers of the Egyptian Armed Forces team. It will be recovered and ready for the Christmas prayers (which falls on January 7 according to the Eastern calendar) ". Pastor Andrea Zaki, head of the Evangelical Church (Protestant), which has about 220 thousand faithful, is also contrary to the bill being considered by the US Congress. "This is a clear interference - he explains - in our internal affairs. The Egyptian government has always shown solidarity towards Christians, and most of the churches have been rebuilt”. The Egyptian Catholic Church has joined the rejection of American interference in the restoration of places of worship. "The Americans were almost absent on August 14 and 15 2013, when our churches were torched by the Muslim Brotherhood" says spokesman Fr. Rafic Greiche. "Their reaction – he adds – is cold and inbad taste." Secular circles have also come out against foreign interference. The Coptic intellectual and analyst Kamal Zakher stresses: "First of all, we ask the US government to stop funding terrorist groups, and to no longer provide hospitality in the United States. It is essential to stop financing the authors of this devastation and the fires, before even thinking of fixing the damage of their actions and of their misdeeds. " Finally, it is worth mentioning that the new law was promoted personally by Republican Senator David Trott and will be discussed in the next session of Congress, in its 114th year, in January. Trott believes that there are still 29 Christian buildings in 24 different places that have not yet been the subject of restoration. For their part, the United States continues to warn their citizens about the dangers of travel in Egypt, for serious security problems. Among the hottest spots include the Western Desert and the Sinai area, as well as the area around the resort town of Sharm el Sheikh, on the Red Sea.﻿

A commercial ice machine is a must-have for bars and restaurants, and for hotels as well as resorts that allow drinks by the pool. Choosing a new commercial ice machine may be a challenge however, as there are so many from which to choose and they are actually more technical than you might imagine. If you need a new commercial ice maker for your establishment or are even thinking of getting one installed in your basement at home, note this quick buying guide.
If this is your first time buying a commercial ice machine, you may be surprised to find out that different types will create different ice cubes. Full-cube ice is similar to what you make at home with a tray in your freezer; these are good for using around salad bars and in glasses of soda, as they melt more slowly and cool things more quickly.
Half-cube ice is a smaller rectangle and these are good for iced coffees and other drinks where ice is going to be blended into the drink. You can also pack more half-cubes into a glass than full cubes, so they may also be good for mixed drinks.
Flake ice and ice chips are good for smoothies and drinks where the ice will be broken down completely, or for restaurants that serve slushy drinks. Ice machines can also be ordered to create unique ice cubes, including rounded ice or cubes in specific shapes.
Air-cooled machines are more affordable and easier to install than water-cooled machines, and these work with cooled air that blows over a condenser to draw heat away from the refrigerator lines. Water-cooled machines have the benefit of not being affected by outside air temperature. These are better for warmer environments, for keeping an ice machine in the hot kitchen of your restaurant, and for when you need to keep the machine quiet since it works without a fan.
It may be a mistake to think you should purchase the largest ice machine you can fit into your facility so that you always have ice on hand, as larger machines will work harder to keep the ice cold. An under-counter variety can also be a good choice for keeping ice convenient for wait staff or to tuck under a bar at home. Take actual measurements, noting any space needed for ventilation, and choose one that fits the space but which won't be too expensive to operate or waste energy to cool more ice than you need.

Newly repackaged, President Barack Obama's State of the Union address will deliver familiar content along with some targeted first-time initiatives that both test and illustrate the limits of divided government in an election year.
WASHINGTON (AP) � Newly repackaged, President Barack Obama's State of the Union address will deliver familiar content along with some targeted first-time initiatives that both test and illustrate the limits of divided government in an election year.
His message to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday will identify measures where he and Congress can cooperate, and he will press issues that will distinguish him and Democrats from Republicans. He'll also make a case for acting alone.
Illustrating his willingness to act on his own, the White House says Obama will announce that he will sign an executive order increasing the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 for new federal contracts. The measure affects only future contracts, not existing ones, and would only apply to contract renewals if other terms of the agreement changed. As a result, the order would benefit far fewer workers than the number foreseen by advocates of federal contract employees.
Still, the issue dovetails with what will be Obama's broader call for an increase in the national minimum wage to $10.10 and for future increases to be tied to inflation. Obama last year had called for an increase in the minimum wage to $9.
The address will be wrapped in a unifying theme: The federal government can play a key role in increasing opportunities for Americans who have been left behind, unable to benefit from a recovering economy. Yet, at the core of the address, the president will deliver a split message.
Even as he argues that low income Americans and many in the middle class lack the means to achieve upward mobility, Obama will also feel compelled to take credit for an economy that by many indicators is gaining strength under his watch. As a result, he will talk positively about a recovery that remains elusive to many Americans.
"We hope that he does not dwell on the successes of the economy, which may be apparent in employment statistics, the GDP and stock market gains, but which are not felt by folks at the grocery store," Democratic political analysts James Carville and Stan Greenberg wrote in a recent strategy memo.
The president will present Congress with an agenda largely unchanged from what he called for a year ago, but one that nevertheless fits neatly into this year's economic opportunity theme. He will continue to seek an overhaul of immigration laws, an increase in the minimum wage and expanded pre-school education.
But after a year in which those proposals languished and gun control failed, the White House is eager to avoid letting Obama be defined by quixotic ambitions. As a result, he will stress success through executive actions, though their reach would be far more modest than what he could achieve through legislation.
"You can be sure that the president fully intends to use his executive authority, to use the unique powers of the office to make progress on economic opportunity to make progress in the areas that he believes are so important to further economic growth and further job creation," White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday.
Obama's biggest and most lasting accomplishment of his second term could be immigration legislation. House Republican leaders lately have sent signals that they are willing to act on piecemeal legislation, and Obama has given them room to work without prodding.
How immigration gets resolved will depend much on what the House is able to pass and if and how it can be reconciled with bipartisan Senate legislation that passed last year. Conservatives are pushing back against any bill that gives legal status to immigrants who are in the country illegally. And some Democrats would prefer to use the unresolved issue to mobilize Hispanic voters for this year's midterm elections.
Eager not to be limited by legislative gridlock, Obama on Tuesday is expected to announce executive actions on job training, retirement security and help for the long-term unemployed in finding work � all in addition to his order to increase the minimum wage on new federal contracts.
Among them is a new retirement savings plan geared toward workers whose employers don't currently offer such plans. The program would allow first-time savers to start building up savings in Treasury bonds that eventually could be converted into a traditional IRAs, according to two people who have discussed the proposal with the administration. Those people weren't authorized to discuss it ahead of the announcement and insisted on anonymity.
"Tomorrow night, it's time to restore opportunity for all," Obama said Monday on the video-sharing site Vine, part of the White House's broad social media promotion of the speech.
The White House says the hike in minimum pay for federal contract workers would most benefit janitors and construction workers working under new federal contracts, as well as military base workers who wash dishes, serve food and do laundry. The White House says contractors will have time to take the higher minimum wage into account when pricing their bids.
Obama's go-it-alone approach has already irritated Republicans, some of whom claim he is pushing the limits of the Constitution; others diminish his initiatives as insubstantial.
"He can work with us to create opportunity and prosperity," wrote Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. "Or he can issue press releases."
The approach, some Republicans say, could also backfire by angering GOP leaders who already don't trust Obama's administration.
"The more he tries to do it alone and do confrontation, the less he's going to be able to get cooperation," said John Feehery, a former top House Republican aide.
Obama will follow his State of the Union address with a quick trip Wednesday and Thursday to Maryland, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Tennessee to promote his proposals. On Friday, Obama will hold an event at the White House where he'll announce commitments from several companies to not discriminate against the long-term unemployed during hiring.
Following tradition, the White House has invited several people to sit with first lady Michelle Obama during Tuesday night's address. Among them are General Motors CEO Mary Barra and Cristian Avila of Phoenix, an immigrant who with two younger siblings was brought to the U.S. illegally when Avila was 9. Now 23, Avila is one of the so-called Dreamers who have benefited from an Obama policy allowing young people who immigrated illegally with their parents to avoid deportation.

Havas Chicago is responding to negative comments made about the agency and its employees on anonymous industry app Fishbowl with an anti-bullying-themed art installation and a brochure that encourages disgruntled employees to look elsewhere.
The installation, which opened on Friday, was showcased on Chief Creative Officer and Chairman Jason Peterson's Instagram account. His posts show a photo of a wall with the words "All of us work here some of us fucking love it," and another of a wall with the words "Employee of the month" above a collection of framed anonymous Fishbowl comments saying things like "The laughing stock in charge is obssesed (sic) with his 1M fake followers" or "I'm embarrassed to work at havas (sic) as well." (Peterson has 1.1 million followers on Instagram.)
Peterson's posts from Friday evening also include images from a brochure, available in the agency, with the same "All of us work here some of us fucking love it" message. The inside has a section introduced as "Conscious Uncoupling."
The brochure reads: "We assume you love working at Havas but if you are not happy in your role, you don't have to continue feeling that way. Conversely, if we see that this is not your jam, we are going to raise this with you. We want you to be happy. We won't hold this against you, we've got your back … Talk to your Manager or your Talent Management Partner to get the conversation started."
That document lists three HR people at the company. It also lists contacts for recruiters from Chicago agencies like FCB, Digitas, Upshot and McGarryBowen.
Tatia Torrey, president and chief client officer at Havas Chicago, said in a statement that "A group of our employees brought this idea to us, they wanted to address some of the hateful online commentary and bullying that exists around some of our employees and our greater industry and expose the damage that it does to people who love their work and this business." Her statement noted that the agency uses its office as an installation space to express what's happening culturally, and has addressed "tough, but real" topics like suicide awareness, immigration, gender equality and racism in the workplace.
"We took it a step further and sent out material that encouraged our staff to talk to us openly if they have real issues, and quite frankly, to consider their choices in their work," she said. "Bullying is something that we simply won't tolerate. If there are issues amongst our business, we would rather address them openly, ultimately with the goal of making this the best possible place to work for our amazing staff that work so hard."
The shop said multiple people in the agency, including Peterson, stepped forward to share comments made about them personally.
The Peterson posts come a month and a half after an internal video popped up on Fishbowl and prompted some negative industry commentary. In the video, which featured Peterson and Havas Creative North America CEO and Chairman Paul Marobella, Peterson said shops like Leo Burnett, FCB and BBDO or other "shitty agencies" aren't Havas' competition, but instead its competition is "kids with iPhones and millions of YouTube followers."
Asked at the time to respond to criticisms that he had called other agencies "shitty," Peterson said the video was internal, so if any Havas employees "want to go work at these other agencies please by all means go and do it."
In a statement regarding the art installation, Peterson said, "Havas Chicago is a unique creative company that requires unique creative people with the right level of commitment, courage and contribution to what that means. In the case where there is not a mutual fit, we'd rather know and address it now and encourage those employees to pursue what's best for them in their careers, while we maintain an amazing creative team here who share a vision and point of view. Constructive discussion and criticism is just that -- constructive," his statement reads. "What we simply will not tolerate is hate or bullying while hiding behind anonymous sources within our business."
The agency says since Peterson posted about the installation on his Instagram, he has received more than 350 direct messages from people interested in working for Havas (many of which he posted on his personal Instagram account stories).
"We are loud and proud and we are not for everyone," she wrote in part. "...We value and promote social media. Yet, the anonymity with some platforms allows for pointed and painful comments at times. Recently many of those comments have been directed at our agency, our environment and the people who work here. We are not O.K. with that. In a manner that is truly Havas CHI, we are bringing this to the forefront. We created a lobby installation to address it head on. We want to talk about it."
The agency says the installation coincided with the launch of Monica Lewinsky's anti-bullying campaign and will likely last until mid-month when it will make way for a breast cancer awareness installation.
When asked for comment, Fishbowl chief operating officer and co-founder Loren Appin said in a statement that the app's community guidelines are thorough and are "not only explicitly against bullying, but also against unconstructive, excessive negativity."
"We have no opinion on how [Havas has] chosen to interact with their own employees, but do believe the representation of Fishbowl as a place for professionals to bully one another is entirely false," he said.

If you want a dual-sport bike that rivals any off-road motorcycle on the planet you want a 2015 KTM 500 EXC, it is quite possibly the greatest dual-sport bike in history. It is an incredible dirt bike that just happens to have a license plate, turn signals, a horn and functions on the road well enough to get from trail to trail, from your house to the trail or just down the road to work if you like. Check out the video here.
What’s a good dirt bike for someone who has 3 years and about 20k miles of street riding under his belt but has zero dirt experience?
I’m happy with this bike, but I wish it had some power down low- it’s so damn easy to labor the engine. It’s like it only has power on a small part of it’s rev-range.
A 7th gear would also be nice (or taller 6th) it feels like it hates doing anything over 75kph. Still, it goes through corners like a beast!
Can someone help me? Where can I get one of these without it being used? I’m new to all this dirt biking stuff. What will be the price? What is the MPG? I’m doing my own research but would appreciate feedback. Thanks in advance.
I’m looking at the ktm 350excf and the 500excf or maybe even the wr450f street legal. Are the ktm’s worth an extra 2k? I hear the the wr is like the most reliable. I really want it for 99% dirt and the only street riding would be to get to the dirt. Maybe 10-15 miles of street. Any suggestions?
hey im 6ft, 160lbs and 16, i have been riding for 6 yrs and was wondering if i should get a yz125 or yz250? Anyone have any suggestions?
I’m looking to get 1 of these dual purpose ktm’s for my next bike. I just can’t decide whether I should get the 350 exc-f or the 500EXC. I’m a light & small dude so I’m leaning towards the 350. as far as experience I’ve ridden my whole life (22yo) & I race a kx125 & 250f in the intermediate class. if anyone has any suggestions I’d be more than happy to hear from you. would you guys please do a video for the 2015 350 exc-f or maybe a comparison video would be cool. BTW great video, beautiful location.

OSWEGO — SUNY Oswego’s high-tech new signs will glow purple overnight Oct. 20 into Oct. 21, to help the campus “Shine the Light on Domestic Violence,” including dating abuse.
The campaign to raise the profile of Domestic Violence Awareness Month encourages public, private and non-profit entities to embrace the color purple — the symbolic hue for domestic violence awareness — by shining purple lights on buildings or other structures in their community, wearing purple or sponsoring awareness events.
LED lighting technology associated with SUNY Oswego’s large exterior signs allows college officials to specify non-standard colors for special occasions.
The college also is asking all employees and students to join the state Office for the Prevention of Domestic Violence’s call for New Yorkers to wear purple on Oct. 21, to help generate discussion and awareness of domestic violence and dating abuse.
SUNY Oswego is engaging the topic of domestic violence in other ways in October, said Title IX coordinator Lisa Evaneski.
Students are taking part in the domestic violence victims’ advocacy Silent Witness Initiative on the academic quad, the train-the-trainer program of One Love.org and an information event on Marano Campus Center’s concourse with a Services to Aid Families advocate.
Elsewhere among awareness initiatives this month, the State University Plaza building in Albany will join many structures statewide bathed in purple lights, according to Chancellor Nancy L. Zimpher.

Masturbation, the habit of self-abuse, often formed before puberty, is an artificial development of sexual precocity. Most boys, from the age of nine to fourteen, interest themselves in sex questions and matters, but these are usually presented to them in a lewd and improper manner, by improperly informed
companions. Dwelling upon these thoughts the boy is led to play with his sex organs in secret and masturbation results. A secret vice of the most dangerous kind, masturbation or self-pollution is often taught by older boys and takes place, to quote an authority "in many of our colleges, boarding, public and
private schools," and is also indulged in by companions beneath the home roof. If it becomes habitual, generally impaired health, and often epilepsy, and total moral and physical degradation results. Stains on the nightshirt or sheet occurring before puberty are absolute evidence of the vice in boys.

These are: Dehydration, heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and most severely heat stroke. Read the rest of this entry »

Nowadays social networks have become ubiquitous and are used to communicate almost anything. For example, you can post a complaint about your leaking kettle directly to Argos` Twitter account and make them apologise!
Investigating the discourse strategies used in tweeted apologies, Ruth Page analysed 1183 apologies gathered from 100 public accounts that included celebrities, ‘ordinary’ members and 40 different companies. The data included both British and American English. She used corpus linguistic tools to identify posts containing direct apologies, searching for key words such as sorry or apologise. Page wanted to find out whether corporate Twitter users apologise differently as opposed to the ‘general public’.
First, she looked at the words used most frequently to express an apology. The absolute winner was sorry (occurring approximately 3600 times per million words): this appeared in posts from all 40 companies. Apology was also very frequent, occurring 563 times per million words. Another option, afraid, was chiefly used by British companies (95% of all uses of afraid, to be precise).
If you are a big company and you`ve already said sorry, is this enough? The answer is ‘no’, unless you want to lose customers. There are several steps you can take to regain your client`s good books.
Page discovered that companies use various linguistic tricks to minimize the damaging effect of a complaint. For instance, they often downplayed the company’s agency by name the third party or the factors beyond the company`s control (e.g. the weather, legal requirement, etc) to be the causes of problems. Constructions downplaying company`s agency are abundant in Tweeter corporate apologies, for example:
· naming non-human factors beyond the company’s control as the cause of the problem – the responsibility lies with the weather, a bot or an app (for example, weather is causing many delays tonight);
· using nominalisations instead of verbs, so avoiding mention of any subject – for example, Booking office closure as opposed to we closed the Booking office;
Companies often present themselves as a source of a solution rather than the source of the problem, for example by offering credits, refunds or further investigation. This is a specific feature of corporate apologies, since only 10% of ‘ordinary’ Twitter members made offers of repair.
Another difference is that companies rarely explicitly restated the reported offence. Two thirds of the companies avoided posts like sorry about the leaking kettle, preferring vague phrasing such as sorry about that. On the one hand, this allows them to avoid drawing further attention to their faulty goods or services and damaging the company’s reputation still further. On the other hand, they still acknowledge the complaint: not doing so could be interpreted as insincerity, which might eventually result in the loss of a customer.
Also, in order to show fellow feeling with the customer, corporate apologies often begin with Hi + first name (e.g. Hi Steve) and finish with Thanks. This may actually work the opposite way, though, because the ‘ordinary members’ don`t need to say Hi Steve every time they post something relevant to their friends!
Tweeting apologies enables companies to react to customers` complaints quickly, so as to minimize any harm to the company`s reputation, avoid losing customers and enhance rapport with them. As Page points out, though, we now need research to find out how customers react to the apologies that they receive through tweets.

Would you like to know more about BMW ConnectedDrive Services? Have you got some questions about the Bluetooth and USB interfaces? You’ll find answers, links and contact data here.
Bluetooth® is an industry standard that enables wireless communication between different devices. Various functions are supported in Bluetooth® profiles. Vehicle-relevant profiles include, for example, Hands-free Profile and Phonebook Access Profile. Further information on Bluetooth ® is available on the internet at www.bluetooth.com and www.bluetooth.org.
BMW was the first automobile manfacturer to introduce the Bluetooth® communication standard for the integration of mobile phones and to offer it in all vehicle models. Requirements for using this standard are the BMW optional equipment SA 644 mobile phone preparation with Bluetooth interface or or SA 633 mobile phone preparation Business with Bluetooth interface (or option code SA 639 for North America).
The mobile devices tested by BMW can be found on the internet at www.bmw.com/bluetooth. Here you can also obtain detailed information on which functions of your mobile device are supported in your vehicle as well as further notes on usage.
BMW recommends using the mobile devices listed at www.bmw.com/bluetooth, which have produced positive test results. Non-listed mobile devices should generally support the basic functions. However, these devices have not been tested by BMW.
Due to the large number of devices appearing on the market, it is necessary to make a selection. Before a selected mobile device can be included on the list, it has to undergo extensive testing with all mobile phone preparations installed in BMW vehicles. After the device has passed these tests, it can be included ionn the list of mobile devices tested by BMW. BMW works with all leading manufacturers so that the latest mobile devices can be included as soon as possible.
BMW recommends using the software status for mobile devices listed at www.bmw.com/bluetooth. No comment is possible on the functionality and compatibility of any other software status. However, general experience shows that when a more recent software status is used, it can be assumed that compatibility characteristics will be similar. Please note that, in some cases, functional limitations may also be due to the data stored in the mobile device and the size of this data.
Why are there differences between the various mobile devices in terms of handling and scope of functions?
As implementation of the Bluetooth® standard differs distinctly between various mobile devices and may also change during the product life cycle of a model, limitations of function in the vehicle may occur for which the BMW Group is not responsible. In addition to the software status of a mobile device, the following factors may also influence compatibility:
For this reason, sporadic functional limitations cannot be ruled out, even in the case of mobile devices which otherwise function reliably.
What happens when there is more than one registered mobile device with activated Bluetooth® function in the vehicle?
When the telephone system is switched on, it automatically looks for the mobile device which was last connected. If this device is not found within a certain period of time, the vehicle automatically looks for the next phone on the list of registrations. If necessary, the list is scanned again.
If you have any questions regarding your mobile device, you can find further information in the operating manual for your mobile device. Assistance is also available from the phone manufacturer or from your mobile phone provider.
Information on the model is generally on the outside of the casing; alternatively in the following menus:
When I reset the mobile device to the factory settings, I am asked to enter a device code. Where can I find this code?
This information can be found in the operating manual of your mobile device. Alternatively, you can obtain it from the manufacturer of the device.
Please avoid exposing the mobile device to extreme conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity), as this may affect the functionality. For example, the charger should be switched off when operating temperatures are running high. further information can be found in the operating manual of your mobile device.
The USB audio interface makes it possible to connect Apple iPhone/iPod devices, suitable MP3 players and USB sticks to your vehicle via a USB interface or a suitable snap-in adapter (not Bluetooth or Aux input). The connected device can be operated using the vehicle’s input controls and the audio data stored on it can then be played. A selection of music is offered according to genre, artist, album, song and playlist. The information displayed is based on the information stored in the MP3 player (e.g. ID3 tags).
The following device classes are supported (details can be found in the compatibility information on the appropriate BMW Group website):
MP3 players and USB sticks (USB mass storage complying with the specification USB Mass Storage Class)
The message “Device not supported” inside the vehicle indicates that the device in use belongs to an unsuitable class of devices.
Due to the large number of devices available on the market and technical differences between them, it is only possible to ensure that they operate perfectly in the vehicle by carrying out a functional test inside the vehicle.
Please note that mobile USB devices have not been developed for use in the vehicl. Therefore, operating conditions inside the car, such as heat, cold and extreme vibrations, may cause damage.
In isolated cases, it is possible that old USB sticks or USB sticks with low transfer rates may not be recognised by the vehicle. This can lead to prolonged waiting times.
Avoid the CDFS file system. The FAT32 file system is recommended. Information on other formats that are supported can be found in your vehicle’s operatring manual.
Some mobile device models do not permit simultaneous Bluetooth operation for the device, i.e. there is no guarantee that it will be possible to receive or make calls.
When Apple iPhone/iPod devices, MP3 players and mobile phones are connected, they are supplied with electrical current via the USB interface. Depending on the entertainment system, up to 1 A is supplied. If your mobile device has been fully discharged prior to use with the USB audio interface, it may take several minutes before you can use it to play music. If the vehicle is not in operation, your mobile device will not be charged any further.
In the case of vehicles with a graphic display, it is also possible to show any covers saved on the player.
In the case of MP3 players (USB mass storage devices in accordance with the specification USB Mass Storage Class or with Media Transfer Protocol (MTP)), the covers to be displayed have to be saved in the individual music files (in the meta data). Please use the special software (e.g. Apple iTunes, Windows Media Player, etc.) for saving the album images in the music file.
The software version of your Apple iPhone/iPod can be found under Settings > General > About > Version. Further information is available on Apple websites. Please note that iTunes can automatically update the iPhone/iPod software, which might adversely affect the interplay between the iPhone/iPod and the USB audio interface.
A description of how to carry out a reset on your iPhone/iPod can be found at the following address:
Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) is a further development of the Picture Transfer Protocol. It enables the transfer of data between mobile devices and computers. MTP-capable MP3 players use the MTP protocol to transfer and synchronise music files. Some MTP-capable MP3 players permit a manual switch between MTP and USB mass storage mode. Please consult the operating manual of the device used in each case.
Depending on your vehicle equipment, you can play audio and video files from an iPhone/iPod or USB device via the USB audio interface.
It is only possible to play iPhone/iPod videos via a snap-in adapter or via a special adapter cable. For more information on playing videos from your iPhone/iPod in the vehicle in your vehicle and on where you can obtain obtain the special adapter cable/special snap-in adapter, please consult the relevant dealer.
For security reasons, your mobile device and mobile phone preparation have to go through a one-off registration (pairing) procedure. You will find notes on the registration procedure in the operating manual of your vehicle as well as in the operating manual for your mobile device.
If a mobile device has already been registered in the vehicle, the connection will be made automatically when you start your journey. However, in order to establish the connection, make sure that the Bluetooth® service is activated both on the telephone and in the vehicle.
During the registration procedure, you will be asked to enter a pass key. You can choose any key you wish. However, for security reasons, it should consist of at least four digits and not be easy to guess (e.g. “0000” or “1234”).
Up to four mobile devices can be registered at the same time. One of these mobile devices can be active (i.e. connected) at any time.
If your BMW vehicle supports music via Bluetooth®, another device (mobile device or a Bluetooth®-capable audio player) can also be connected with the vehicle at the same time.
You can remove the ignition key during the telephone conversation without having to end the call. The telephone system remains switched on until either you or the person you are talking to has ended the call. However, depending on the vehicle equipment and battery charging status, the telephone system may be switched off earlier. You may then continue the call on your mobile phone.
I have made changes in the contacts, calendar entries, to-do notes or notes on my mobile device. When will these changes be shown in the vehicle?
Please check on www.bmw.com/bluetooth whether the relevant function is supported by your mobile device and vehicle equipment.
In general, the data update is initiated as soon as the ignition is switched on. Please check the display on your mobile device as well: you may have to confirm the data transfer.
The sort sequence for the telephone book depends on both the mobile device and the vehicle equipment. Some mobile devices do not distinguish between first names and last names: Both names are entered into one text field; in many mobile devices, a comma or semi-colon determines which part is interpreted as the first name or last name. This applies in particular to entries on the SIM card as well.
Some mobile devices provide an option for setting the sort sequence – however, this may not necessarily be taken into account when the telephone book is transferred via the Bluetooth® connection. In current vehicles with the relevant equipment, it is possible to set the sorting sequence in the Control Display.
You will find further information in the operating manual for your vehicle and at www.bmw.com/bluetooth
This function must be supported by your vehicle equipment, the mobile device and your mobile phone provider. The mobile phone provider may have to activate this service on the SIM card.
Further information can be found in the operating manual for your mobile device, in the operating manual for your vehicle and at www.bmw.com/bluetooth.
Normally, this is because the caller has activated the Withhold number function on their mobile device.
Please check the settings of your mobile device to see whether the Withhold number function is activated.
If this is not the case, the problem may be due to the fact that your mobile device provider activates this function by default (CLIR = Calling Line Identification Restriction). To have CLIR deactivated, please contact your mobile device provider.
Appointments that are either older than 20 days or that lie more than 50 days in the future are not transferred. Completed to-dos or to-dos that lie more than 90 days in the future are not transferred. Depending on the number of appointments stored in your mobile device, not all will be displayed in the vehicle.
The transfer of call lists depends both on the mobile device and on the vehicle. Please check which mobile devices support the export of call lists at www.bmw.com/bluetooth and whether your vehicle is equipped with this function.
When you are using mobile devices that do not support call lists, the lists shown in the vehicle include only those calls made using the Bluetooth® connection in the vehicle.
The transfer of text messages depends both on the mobile device and on the vehicle. Please observe the information on this at www.bmw.com/bluetooth.
Make sure that the Audio (Bluetooth) function is activated on the Control Display and check whether your mobile device supports Bluetooth audio reproduction on www.bmw.com/bluetooth.
On some mobile devices, it is necessary to start the programme for playing music files on your mobile device and then select a title using the device.
Normally, the muting of audio reproduction is cancelled automatically. Should this not be the case, you can restart the audio reproduction by pressing the volume key again.
Can I use the audio reproduction function of my mobile device via Bluetooth® if the mobile device is connected with the vehicle via the USB snap-in adapter or a USB cable?
Why is the contact photo that is stored in the telephone book not shown on the Control Display for some of my contacts?
Please check on www.bmw.com/bluetooth whether the function Contact pictures is supported by your mobile device and vehicle equipment. Please note that the number of contact pictures supported is limited by the system.
This requires the optional equipment with the option code SA 614 in connection with SA 644 or SA 6NK in vehicles with a date of production of September 2010 onwards (this function is not offered in all countries).
Please ensure that the system has been updated before you use the internet in the vehicle for the first time. This can be performed in the Control Display under BMW Services > Service status > Update BMW Services.
Please also make sure that your mobile device is properly configured. Further information can be found below in this FAQ section.
In the operating manual of your mobile device, you will find instructions on configuring Access Point Name (APN); other names for this may be “Internet Settings”, “Modem Settings” or “Tethering Settings”. The required settings are available from your service provider.
Please note that most Sony Ericsson mobile devices only recognise the first entry in the APN list. We therefore recommend deleting all other APN configurations.
After a Bluetooth connection has been established, my mobile device attempts to dial a phone number on its own.
In connection with BMW TeleServices (option code SA 6AA), a BMW Teleservice Call is initiated automatically when a service is required. This may involve numerous attempts to establish a data connection over the mobile device in order to transmit vehicle data.
If the mobile device supports the transfer of entries stored on the SIM card, these are also shown in the vehicle.
Why is it that, when I make a phone call, a different name to the one I dialled appears in the display?
This sometimes happens when the same number is used for several different entries in the telephone directory. When a phone call is made, only one of the names attributed to this number is displayed.
File names should be kept short so that the length displayed (including the directory paths) does not exceed 255 characters. Should this length be exceeded or several files with the same name be present on one storage medium, they will be identified by numbers and the names will be shortened. Please do not use any special characters or symbols when naming your device.
When MP3 players or USB sticks are connected for the first time, the music files can initially only be accessed via the directory structure of the device. The more convenient method of searching via genre, artist, album or song is not possible until all the relevant file information has been transferred. The response of the MP3 player or USB stick, such as the duration of the synchronisation and the operating speed, depends on the storage capacity and technology of the device being used as well as the number and type of stored audio tracks. In the case of an MP3 player with an 8 GB Flash memory, this synchronisation takes approximately 10 minutes. This may take longer, depending on the device used. During this time, the audio tracks can be selected via directories and file names.
Playlists in M3U format are supported by all BMW USB audio interfaces. Other formats are also supported, depending on the type of your USB audio interface. Please consult your operating manual for information on this subject.
Why doesn’t my vehicle always start with the USB audio interface, even though the last audio output source was from an external device?
Some USB devices need more time to be recognised by the USB audio interface, depending on size, capacity and speed of access. This becomes apparent, for example, due to the fact that some devices have to be actively selected under Entertainment and the music playback does not start automatically, even when the USB audio interface was the last active audio source when the user left the vehicle.
In individual cases, problems may occur with recognition of the Apple iPhone/iPod. The following steps may provide a remedy:
If you have a vehicle with Extended connection for music player in the mobile phone (USB snap-in adapter), it may be necessary to remove the USB snap-in adapter from the base plate if you wish to operate an iPhone/iPod on the USB interface. This also applies to an empty snap-in adapter.
For example, when the vehicle is switched off and on again and the mobile device remains connected via the USB cable, the USB connection is occasionally not re-established. In this case, the USB link must be disconnected and then reconnected.
Equipment with the option code SA 6NB or the SAP snap-in adaptor can be operated via the SIM card of a GSM provider or via a mobile phone that supports the SAP Bluetooth profile.
Why do I need the optional equipment Extended connectivity of the music player in the mobile phone (SA 6NF)?
In addition to existing telephone equipment (options SA 633 or SA 644) and the USB audio interface (option SA 6FL), there is the extended connectivity of the music player in the mobile phone (option SA 6NF). With the aid of a matching USB snap-in adapter, this equipment can be used for accessing the music data stored on the phone in nearly all series for selected mobile devices.
Equipped with the matching USB snap-in adapter for your mobile device, you meet all the conditions for using your mobile device with both the hands-free and audio reproduction functions at the same time.
For optimum operation of the mobile device in the vehicle, BMW Group recommends using a snap-in adapter to ensure that the mobile device is secured safely, that it is charged and that it is connected with the external aerial. Information on the current range of snap-in adapters can be found at www.bmw.com/bluetooth.
Audio reproduction from USB devices is supported with the special optional equipment SA6NL, SA6NK, SA6NH or SA6FL. This may also be available as standard equipment in some markets.
In vehicles that contain the USB audio interface as a standard feature, the SA numbers are no longer listed separately.
Extensions can be used to connect your devices, as can adapter cables from USB mini/micro to USB. This use of a flexible adapter cable is actually recommended in order to protect the USB interface and your MP3 player against mechanical damage. The cable should not be more than one metre in length.
First of all, check whether the mobile device is on the list of mobile devices tested by BMW (www.bmw.com/bluetooth).
The pass key entered in the vehicle must be identical to that entered in the mobile device. In addition, the registration procedure has to take place within 30 seconds. For older models, the passkey should be entered within seven seconds. If you have to repeat the registration procedure, it may be necessary to delete the existing entries on the list of devices. For more information, please consult the operating manual for your mobile device.
Why is my mobile device unable to automatically reconnect? And why is a previously reliably supported function no longer available as usual?
Make sure that the Bluetooth® service is activated in the mobile device and in the vehicle. If no automatic connection is established, check the display on your mobile device.
Some mobile devices require a confirmation for the current connection and for subsequent connections. Further information can be found in the operating manual for your mobile device.
If the mobile device fails to connect automatically even after several attempts, this may be solved by switching the mobile phone off completely and then switching it back on again, by briefly removing the battery or resetting the mobile phone to the factory settings. Before resetting the mobile phone, you are strongly advised to back up your data.
Also check whether the registration information is still present in both the vehicle and in the mobile device. If this is not the case, delete the remaining registration entries and carry out the registration procedure again.
The inability to establish a permanent or stable connection (e.g. repeated interruptions of the Bluetooth connection) is often due to a hardware error in the mobile device or in the data stored on the mobile device (e.g. telephone book entries, text messages, call lists). In such cases, it is recommended that you reset the mobile device to the factory settings (if necessary, carry out a data backup beforehand).
The name of the person I am talking to is not displayed, although this person is stored in the mobile device.
If the call was initiated from the mobile device while a Bluetooth connection was active, it cannot be guaranteed that the number or name of the other party will appear on the Control Display. Otherwise, check whether the telephone book of the mobile device is displayed on the Control Display and that the contact has been transferred correctly and completely.
This function is not supported by all mobile devices. And some mobile devices transfer the current signal strength but with a considerable delay. Further information is available www.bmw.com/bluetooth.
Not all contact entries are shown on the Control Display and/or not all details of the contact entries of the mobile device are displayed. The transfer of contact entries depends both on the mobile device and on the vehicle. The number of contact entries is limited by the system. Further information is available www.bmw.com/bluetooth.
In many cases, Blackberry mobile device are operated in Enterprise mode. In such cases, the company’s IT administration defines the security settings and policy.
In most cases, the problem can be resolved by adapting one of these security settings. Please check whether the following option is set to No:
If you are not able to change this option or it does not produce the desired effect, please consult your IT administrator.
First of all, check at www.bmw.com/bluetooth, whether your mobile device supports the desired functions in connection with your vehicle. Also make sure that downloading e-mails and text messages as well as the calendar, tasks and notes does not begin until the telephone book has been downloaded completely. This may take several minutes, depending on the size and contents of the telephone book. In addition, the download process is interrupted when a telephone call is made or received.
After a Bluetooth connection has been established, notification sounds can be heard repeatedly on my mobile device. Some of these sounds are transmitted over the vehicle’s loudspeakers.
When calendar entries, tasks and notes are accessed, some mobile devices emit notification sounds. Depending on the mobile device used, these notification sounds can be deactivated (e.g. in the profile settings). Status and error messages that may appear on the mobile device can be ignored.
In this case, data encryption (Content Protection) prevents the transfer of data from the locked Blackberry to the vehicle. If the Blackberry has been unlocked by entering the password, the messages will be transferred correctly.
To resolve this issue permanently, the security options should be configured on the mobile device as follows: Menu > Options > Security Options > Encryption: Disabled. If you are unable to adjust these settings, please contact the administrator of the Blackberry Enterprise Server at your company’s IT department.
Purchased songs are often provided with copy protection (DRM: Digital Rights Management). Songs with copy protection cannot be played and are skipped. The next eligible song in the list is then played. The same procedure applies to corrupt or defective songs.
Please check your MP3 files and re-rip them or rip them with different software. If you have connected your mobile device with the Aux-In port, set the output volume on your device to maximum and then adjust the volume via the entertainment system of your vehicle.
If you can find certain songs in the directory only, check the ID3 tag information for the songs. If this information is not filled in correctly, it is not possible to sort the songs correctly.
If you change the ID3 tags of files on the storage medium, it is sometimes possible that the change will not be recognised by the USB audio interface. In such cases, please disconnect the device from the USB audio interface and delete a file on the device or add a file to it. By doing this, you force the song information to be reread when the device is next connected to the USB audio interface.
Sometimes the radio plays when the vehicle starts up, although the USB audio interface was the last audio source selected.
When the vehicle starts up, an attempt is made to play the last audio source. In the case of the USB audio interface, this is affected by the MP3 player connected. When the vehicle starts up, the time taken to recognise the MP3 player may vary. This depends on factors such as the size, capacity and access speed of the MP3 player. In some cases, communication to the MP3 player cannot be established quickly enough and the vehicle therefore first switches to radio.
Why does it sometimes take some time for the USB audio interface to react to the random play setting?
Random play is executed by your Apple iPhone / iPod or your USB audio interface. The time taken to adopt the random play setting depends on the size of the lists. Delays may occur particularly with long lists.
The digits shown represent placeholders for entries in the list and are displayed whenever the information from your MP3 player cannot be loaded quickly enough. As soon as the information is available, the entries in the lists are completed.
This message appears when you are scrolling quickly in a list or when browsing in folders with lots of entries.
MP3 files playing at different volumes although the sound control for playback in the vehicle has not been altered might be due to the MP3 files themselves. Please check the volume settings when converting the audio tracks to MP3 files and, if necessary, reconvert the audio tracks into MP3 files. Alternatively, you can use a programme to standardise the volume of your music collection.
In the case of older software versions, the music filter is sometimes not saved in the vehicle. You should therefore update the software version of your Apple device. You can display the software version you have installed on your Apple device via the menu option: Settings > General > About > Version.
In rare cases, it is possible for a black image to be shown when apps are active in the background on your Apple device. If this is the case, you should close any apps that are not required, via the task manager of your device.

As you can guess from my blog, I love reading books! I'm doing this just for fun, to share my love for books, but I'll always write an honest review for every book I read, it doesn't matter if it's a book I bought myself, a book I borrowed or a book that was sent to me from the publisher or the author. I read & love books from all genres & for all ages! I also love participating in reading challenges & read-a-thons, too!
"Waiting On" Wednesday is a weekly event, hosted by Jill at Breaking the Spine, that spotlights upcoming releases that we're eagerly anticipating.
Fourteen-year-old Nick has learned that the strange antiques in his attic bedroom were left there by the eccentric inventor Nikola Tesla. They are pieces of Tesla's Far Range Energy Emitter, capable of transmitting 'free energy' to the globe. Some components of the contraption are still missing, but the objects themselves seem to be leading Nick and his friends to their current owners.
However, members of the Accelerati, a menacing secret society of physicists, are on the hunt too, and their brazen leader, Dr. Alan Jorgenson, will stop at nothing to foil Nick and steal the objects. It takes a dangerous build-up of electromagnetic energy in the atmosphere to reverse everyone's fortunes--and lead Nick to his destiny.
Readers who enjoyed the strange science, quirky humor, and out-of-this-world plot twists in Tesla's Attic will be captivated by this second book in the electrifying Accelerati Trilogy.
I loved the first book in the trilogy Tesla's Attic, and I can't wait to read more. I know that Edison's Alley will be another entertaining novel full of awesomeness.

Press Release - GSCS’ First Annual Clean Water Cup Helps Fund Clean Water for 50,000 Reports CEO Philip Odette
Global Supply Chain Solutions’ first Clean Water Cup charity golf tournament raised enough money to produce between 10 and 20 clean water wells around the world.
Weathermatic contracted Global Supply Chain Solutions, LLC. to substantially reduce costs and improve the visibility of supply chain operations.

Not too bad, given the slim pickings on the ballot this year. Taylor Swift is the top country nominee with eight noms. Keith Urban earned four, while Willie Nelson, George Strait, Lee Ann Womack, and Zac Brown Band earned three.
Additionally, Johnny Cash and Keith Urban picked up nominations for Best Long Form Music Video and Dolly Parton earned a nomination for composing and producing the cast album for the Broadway adaption of 9 to 5.
I’m amused that Brad Paisley was nominated in the Best Rock Instrumental Performance category, but none of the tracks from Play could land in the corresponding Country category, which only has four nominees… Way to be, NARAS. Way to be.
Wow. 8 nominations for Taylor Swift…really? I mean, seriously?! All I can say if she beats Carrie in the vocal race then I would lose most if not all respect in the NARAs because “Just a Dream” has the best vocals of all the nominated songs…not to mention it’s a better written song than “White Horse.”
And since she’s nominated in the all genre album that’s basically a lock for her to win the country one right?? You guys are good researchers…has any country album that has been nominated in the all genre category NOT won the country album Grammy??
My biggest wish would be for “Sea of Heartbreak” to pick up a trophy. Compared to last year, the country categories are super weak. I’m excited to see Womack with three nominations.
This has to be the most mainstream list, at least in the general field, we’ve ever seen. I expected these exact top contenders, but never thought they’d rack up so many nods. Beyonce’s great, but ten nominations? Really? And do not even start me off on Black Eyed Peas.
What I really want to know is how “Halo” got the nod for Record over “Single Ladies.” How does that work on any level?
To paraphrase Ulysses Everett McGill: It’s a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
“Single Ladies” was, for whatever reason, submitted for Record of the Year last year before it was actually a hit, so it was ineligible to be submitted in that category this year… But not in any of the other categories that it wasn’t submitted in last year, like Best Female R&B Vocal Performance.
I completely and wholeheartedly agree. Right now, pretty much nobody can touch Kelly for vocals. Her voice is ridiculous.
But I am super excited about Lee Ann picking up 3 nominations. It almost made up for the Kelly snub. Almost.
To paraphrase Ulysses Everett McGill: It’s a fool who looks for logic in the chambers of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.”
Willie Nelson & Asleep at the Wheel nominated as Best Americana album ????. That album is more country than any of the country nominees !
The first round ballot was shorter than usual this year, but if there’s one surprise from my perspective, it’s that Brad Paisley didn’t get a nod for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, even though he submitted both “Then” and “Welcome to the Future.”
I wonder if the Instrumental category was limited to four nominees because there were only 23 to choose from?
I know you guys think Brad Paisley can do no wrong, but IMO Keith Urban can sing rings around him. I also think his album is way better than Brad’s. Keith’s may not be country, but I’d still rather listen to it than anything Brad sings. Congrats to Keith for all his hard work. Oh yeah Hoggy…how do you think Taylor wins all her awards if it weren’t for her gigantic sales??? It sure can’t be on her singing ability and all her high school songs.
I thought the Grammys had a higher intergrity then this, Last year they shunned Swift out altogether, which was a great message to send considering the Grammys are all about artistic integrity and the music. Of course they could never get away with that again without losing alot of viewers and causing an uproar so give her 8 nominations to keep everyone happy. Garth Brooks was popular once, did he ever sweep the nominations, I dont think so but the young girl who cant sing can pull it off.
I think the worst nomination for me, even more then the 2 female vocalists is ‘Song of the Year’ for ‘You Belong With Me,’ Of all the songs written in the past year, this is considered in the top 5? What rhymes with me? oh ya, why can’t you see’ Bubble gum pop rules! What’s sadder, I’d be suprised if she doesnt win all 8, that’s 8 shocked camera close up looks of her face we will have to see, after her horrible performance she’s gonna give which will have the usual props and hair flicks to cover up the voice.
The Grammys are a popularity contest. It’s the only way a dreadful, piece of trash like You Belong With Me can be nominated and every awards show loses credibility by nominating Swift.
If you study this site, you will see that there is plenty of criticism for brad. Even I’ve given a less than favorable single rating to “Then” and “I’m Still A Guy and I was lukewarm about “Waitin’ on A Woman”, even though most others liked it.
I think the Grammys have rarely been about integrity and have instead veered among conservatism (the Beatles and Elvis in their prime), routine (Alison Krauss, Mary Chapin), late-in-time recognition (Ray Charles, Herbie Hancock, Steely Dan) and sheer unadulterated popularity (pretty much every year).
All in all, I don’t think the nominees are that bad. At least there’s no stand-out weird nomination on the country side. And if it’s odd that Brad Paisley gets a rock instrumental nomination, I don’t care: it’s payback for the year Aaron Neville was nominated for male country vocal.
I’m not going to lie I think this is the weakest nominees the Grammy’s have ever had. I mean in general, nit the country category in particular, which actually isn’t too shabby.
Wow, I’m not pleased that “Muddy Water” and “Ride” got beat out by the other two songs, or that “Welcome to the Future” didn’t get a nod. And both of the other Urban songs submitted were more worthy IMO than “Sweet Thing”.
I would doubt that Taylor Swift could win most of those awards. But I learned never to doubt Taylor Swift again when she won Entertainer of the Year, and especially when Gloriana beat Lady GaGa simply due to the fanbase they probably got from touring with Taylor (that is correct, isn’t it?).
“What I really want to know is how “Halo” got the nod for Record over “Single Ladies.” How does that work on any level?”
Halo was submitted for record and Single Ladies for song only. That’s why it’s so screwed up. Beyonce is a Grammy favorite, so she’ll probably win at least one of those….
Gloriana beat Lady GaGa simply due to the fanbase they probably got from touring with Taylor (that is correct, isn’t it?).
No, that’s incorrect. Swift told her supporters to vote for her. They wouldn’t have given a damn if she hadn’t interfered.
Alison Krauss also picked up a nomination with Yo-Yo Ma in one of the classical categories for his Songs of Joy and Peace album.
basing on what i read here and most of the message boards — it would benefit swift to win 1 or 2 awards only from all these categories she’s nominated on. if she wins about 5 of them — it will surely backfire on her career. i dont think the music industry can take a mediocre singer who sings about boys and high school too much anymore. to get a pop vocal performance nod over kelly clarkson is just atrocious.
i’m betting that aside from the Big Four — the grammy’s will start to air all the categories that beyonce or taylor is gonna win. that should clue us all.
Lemme ask some questions, Why American Saturday Night and Revolution weren’t nominated in the Best Country Album Category?
Taylor Swift is about as country as Snoop Dogg, and if I have to see her fake surprise act one more time when she wins, I will hurl.
If that bubble gum highschool musical album wins Album of the year, then music truly is dead, or else her rich daddy passed some major payola to the voters and Grammy museum, just like the jonas brothers donated 75k last year. Then they got a nomination and performance slot. Interesting.
Taylor being nominated in any vocal category is a joke and an insult to Reba, Kelly Clarkson, and all the more deserving artists that got snubbed to make way for the Taylor Swift Express train.
I used to respect the Grammys and CMAS. Now, after the 2009 CMAS, I lost all respect for how they gave the worst vocalist in the history of country music, top honors over Carrie and Miranda for Female Vocalist. I am still in shock over that.
If Taylor sweeps all these awards, despite having the worst live singing voice of even the hip hoppers and rappers, something is very very rotten in Denmark.
I wonder if this is all a knee jerk reaction to the Kanye West VMA thing still? If so, get over it voters, because she is laughing her way home with truckfuls of awards and huge sales, and I swear the whole Kanye thing was planned. Brilliant PR move, Ms. Swift.
Now let’s hope the grammy voters are finally over the Taylor mania or pity voting after the Kanye incident. If they vote with clear heads for once, hopefully Carrie or Miranda will win Female Vocalist, and more deserving artists like Lady Gaga or Beyonce will sweep the big categories.
Seriously, I’m not going to defend Swift’s voice, but she’s certainly not the worst vocalist in the history of music. Hyperbole much? Her level of success is somewhat baffling, I admit, but I really don’t believe it has anything to do with her father’s money. Maybe the money helped get things started for her, but it’s highly unlikely that it’s what’s sustained her career on its current level.
Sugarland (“Nightswimming/Joey”) and McBride (“Ride”) should’ve been nominated for their respective other submissions… which were remotely better than the ones that made it into the final cut.
I think I feel kind of neutral on Swift now… since she has picked up noms in Pop AND Country… Flabergasted… Don’t know what to think.
(On the other hand, Faith Hill did recieve a Pop nom for her “There You’ll Be” song from Pearl Harbor)
I do think “Single Ladies” would’ve been a better choice than “Halo” and wish that Kelly Clarkson could’ve been nominated…
I wholeheartedly agree that TS can not sing and is a teeney bopper entertainer. I think once she matures she might be worthy of her songwriting ability and awards. But enough already!!!!
George Strait’s “Twang” is a whole lot better and more country than TS “Fearless”. If anyone should win the Country AOTY, it should go to George for Twang. Also vocal performance should go to George for Living for the Night. This man is amazing and is still going strong after 25+ years in the industry. Go, George, and win those grammies.
Why isn’t In Color in the Best Country Song of the Year category? How can People Are Crazy, High Cost of Living and You Belong With Me make it but not that?
Mike, ‘In Color’ was nominated last year (it lost to ‘Stay’). The Grammies only let you nominate something once.
…if you pick on your husband the way you pick on taylornation every chance you get, you might put yourself in danger of getting the “earl- treatment” one day, maureen mccole.

The 600m Summits of Ireland 2001 (from Joss Lynam, created from earlier lists which had the cooperation of Rev CRP Vandeleur)
Extensive revision and extra data has been accepted from many people including Brian Ringland, Paul Donnelly, Simon Stewart, John FitzGerald, Paul Tempan, Denise Jacques, Colin Dalton, Brendan O'Reilly, Mark Brennan, Peter Walker, Gary Smith, Bryan McCabe, Pat Healy, David Walsh, David Purchase.
Irish forms of mountain names were originally compiled by Paul Tempan, along with translations and notes on the summits and their names (2004-). The main sources for names are Ordnance Survey maps (OSI and OSNI/LPS) and the databases of An Brainse Logainmneacha / The Placenames Branch and of the Northern Ireland Place-Name Project. Others are gathered from place-name surveys (see article in Resources), and some are the result of original research by Paul Tempan
From November 2014 an enhanced system "Propose Place Database Change" was introduced allowing users to propose changes to the database of summits that MountainViews holds. Changes can be proposed to over 30 fields ranging from names to mountain area to geology. As of August 2015 over 150 changes had been proposed with most accepted. In May 2017 some 549 islands were added sourced from Oileáin by David Walsh.
Popularity information as of 2012 is based on the over 1400 people using MountainViews to record what summits they have climbed. (2002-)
Mountain rating information as of 2012 is based on around 8000 ratings of summits (in seven categories) by MountainViews members. (2002-). Position information is continuously being revised by the online GPS measurement system.(2004-)
Note: For most of the lists, which are summit lists, inclusion is based on absolute height listing. Mountains must be 400m or above with a 30m drop (aka prominence) from the summit qualifying them as a separate top or 150m or above with a prominence of 150m. The list will be refined as checking proceeds. The aim is to produce a "strict" or "standard" list adhering to the prominence requirement and an "inclusive" list including those that didn't appear to quite make it or which have some other intrinsic interest. The inclusive list maximises opportunities for comments, photos and inclusion in walks, all objectives of this site.
The "County Highpoints" list includes the 27 County Highpoints of Ireland, not all of which are summits.
The "100 Local" list includes the first 100 summits we list nearest to where you have told us your location is. The purpose of this is to provide a list whose completion requires less travelling.
The "Hundred Highest" list includes summits with a prominence at minimum of 100m and has been introduced to give a height based list, not too long, with a spread of locations for Ireland.
The "100 Rated" uses information from each of thousands of individual rating entries provided by members to rank summits and provide a unique and hopefully useful selection.
The "Vandeleur-Lynam" list includes those summits of at least 600m with a prominence of 15m. Its definition follows the practice of and agreement with the late Joss Lynam.
The "Arderins" list includes those summits of at least 500m with a prominence of 30m. The name Arderin was chosen as a representative member of these summits, near the centre of the island of Ireland and whose name means Height of Ireland. Some summits are both Vandeleur-Lynams and Arderins.
The "Arderin Begs" list includes those summits of at least 500m with a prominence of between 15 and less than 30m.
The "Carns" list includes those summits of at least 400 but less than 500m in height with a prominence of 30m.
The "900m" list has the same summits as a 3000 footer list, the height of the Scottish Munros (3000 foot= 914.4m). This list is short and oddly bunched in one main area in Ireland with no summits north or west of Wicklow and is included for historical interest as it doesn't make much of a long-term challenge or interesting agenda.
All lists can be sorted by any of their fields such as "height" or "popularity". For most of the height based lists it is possible to further select by area.
As of May 2017 a basic list handling islands has been introduced. However this has various ambiguities which will be improved in time. Records of islands or island highpoints logged as being visited will be retained.
Mountain Views is an online service developed by Simon Stewart (website: Hillwalking in Ireland) and others using data from a variety of sources. The software is copyright Simon Stewart and was developed with open source tools starting from the launch in June 2002. Help from Eoin O'Sullivan ( www.hillwalkers.com) is greatfully acknowledged. Additional data about map boundaries came from Tom of Megalithomania.
Digital elevation data used to construct the topographical maps ("SRTM data") came from a NASA shuttle mission of 2000. The data was released in early 2004. The version we have used was partially cleaned up by Geomantics in the UK.

The summit overlooks great areas of Cork farmland and some of Kerry. There is a good view of the gracious Paps to the SW. It can be reached from the Duhallow Way to the north and east, with particular starting points such as W196893 A or W177850 B. Or make it part of a ridge walk from Caherbarnagh from which it is separated by around 650m and a NE facing corrie.
Going is good on the summit with short grass or heather though some of the lower slopes are harder. The exact top is somewhat vague. Trackback: https://mountainviews.ie/summit/157/comment/4917/
To the west the sensual Paps contrast with the violent, twisted slopes of Crohane and Stoompa rising above the tranquil Lough Guitane
then up to Glanaprehane, to Caherbarnagh, then eastwards along the ridge. The views were excellent but the terrain is a little boggy. If two cars are available it would be possible to
walk along the whole ridge from Knocknabro to Claragh mountain and then down to Millstreet. Trackback: https://mountainviews.ie/summit/157/comment/1463/
Wish the view was as good as the photo by Jackhill the day I took my camera. Going up can often be easier than coming down and today we came down from Glanaprehane on the closer fallaway ridge by moving out to the end of it turning right near the end and then left again. Much easier to go up. The boggy soft ground is a help but a few more rocks would make a man feel safer on the way down. To go up, in my opinion its one of the best challenges to reach the higher Caherbarnagh apart from taking it straight on from the coom (very hard) or firstly ascending Stoukeen considering any ascent from the Clydagh valley is pretty damp. This said I would alternatley recommend an ascent from W177 850 B as the driest from the Clydagh valley which is beautiful and long valley which is nice and quiet as there is only one way in and out for normal traffic. Trackback: https://mountainviews.ie/summit/157/comment/2277/
Approached Caherbarnagh NW from Knocknagowan via Caherbarnagh, I had planned to head on to Knocknabro and back up the road in Clydagh valley, but the going is so tough over the tussocky boggy ground from Clydagh I decided to head back the way I came.
The views to the North are lovely and the valley between Caherbarnagh NW and Caherbarnagh looks like a great climb, I'm sure it's horribly slippery though.
Reaching the summit of Caherbarnagh NW, I came across a tiny cairn which needs some urgent help, so if you've got some room in your backpack for a few rocks, you know what to do. Trackback: https://mountainviews.ie/summit/157/comment/6745/

They have been overwhelmingly supportive and interested in searching for solutions and commonalities, participating in several meetings between the leaders of the nonprofits and themselves in the weeks leading up to the Trinity Church community meeting.
Coming on the heels of the city blocking short-term rentals in the River Arts District, City Council voted against allowing such lodging throughout the Haywood Road corridor. At its Nov. 28 meeting, City Council placed heavy restrictions on lodging along Haywood Road in West Asheville, specifically targeting whole-unit short-term rentals such as those offered through Airbnb.
For the second meeting in a row, City Council will consider whether to allow whole-house, short-term rentals in a neighborhood covered by a form-based zoning code. On Nov. 28, it will take a close look at STRs in the area around Haywood Road.
Homeowners on Vermont Avenue in West Asheville see their neighborhood as a quiet, special residential pocket of the city — and they intend to keep it that way. Residents implored the Planning and Zoning Commission to stop a property owner from opening an art gallery in a house on the street. That issued tied into a discussion of short-term rentals and whether Asheville wants tourists “in every nook and cranny.”
Asheville City Council appears committed to holding the city’s line on any potential expansion of short-term rentals. Council members put the kibosh on a proposal to allow short-term rentals on a stretch of Haywood Road in West Asheville, while also instructing city staff to explore banning the practice in all areas of the city, including the River Arts District and downtown. Homestays, a type of accommodation where the primary resident is home during a guest’s short-term stay, would remain legal.
In keeping with the autumn harvest season, Asheville City Council will feast on a cornucopia of topics at its Oct. 3 meeting, including dam improvement, Haywood Road development and the business impact of special events.

The concept is equal parts old-school butcher shop, meat-centric restaurant and friendly neighborhood bar. The hybrid, slated for an early September opening, is taking over the 697 Haywood Road location that previously housed Bandidos Latin Kitchen.
City Council’s regular meeting on Tuesday, March 22 at 5 p.m. will be preceded by a budget worksession at 3 p.m. in the first floor conference room of City Hall.
A new fast-casual Italian eatery is taking over the Haywood Road space previously occupied by Pineapple Jack’s.
It’s walkable, artistic, neighborly, inspiring and it’s not filled with tourists. It has grit and its own unique spirit. It’s not downtown — it’s West Asheville.
After months of preparation, city of Asheville staff will present a new “form-based” zoning plan for the Haywood Road corridor at a meeting tomorrow night, Thursday, March 27. The new plan is a very different approach from the city’s previous development rules, and could provide a model for overhauling other neighborhoods’ zoning as well.
Late last month, Asheville City Council passed the Haywood Road Vision Plan, a years-long effort by community members and city staff to outline the future of the corridor. It’s not a one-time event either: Such plans for different areas of the city are a main way city leaders hope to shape the Asheville of tomorrow, and it’s a plan they want to extend to more neighborhoods. Sometimes, however, these plans can also prove controversial.
From grand plans for the future of the Haywood Road Corridor to the Avalon housing development, Asheville City Council will face both still-forming designs and more concrete building efforts at its meeting tomorrow, Feb. 25.
After months of development, a new plan for the future of West Asheville’s major corridor comes to Asheville City Council at its next meeting, Feb. 25. The plan calls for a new form of zoning, improved pedestrian infrastructure and keeping the area’s historic feel to make “a neighborhood leader for sustainability in the city.” If successful, other neighborhoods might get similar development overhauls.
At an open house last night on the city of Asheville’s plans to change development rules on the Haywood Road corridor found many community members taking a “wait and see” approach, even as they discussed some goals with planners and consultants.
The truck, which will also visit The Lot, serves an idiosyncratic mash-up of global cuisines and novelty meats.

When people feel powerless – locked out of decision-making, bypassed by real governance – they turn to protest. Especially for the disenfranchised and oppressed, protest is often the only way to exert power and affect policies and practices that impact their lives and communities.
With Donald Trump in the White House and the Republican Party in control of both houses of Congress and a majority of statehouses around the country, protest is now a key avenue of resistance.
We can’t expect an agenda that puts people and planet first to come from above, so people are taking to the streets. The first hundred days of the new administration have been marked as much by protest as by Trump’s demagoguery and appeals to hate and fear.
So it is no wonder that there is a new wave of anti-protest laws being implemented across the country. When protests are powerful, the powerful punish protest.
On May 9, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed a bill into law that increases fines for civil disobedience, and seeks to punish “conspirator” organizations. The ordinance, HB 2128, targets protests that disrupt “critical infrastructure” with felony charges and a minimum of $10,000 fine. There are further fines of up to $100,000 and up to ten years in jail for those found damaging facilities. Organizations that “compensate” such protests could face up to $1 million in fines.
Rep. Mark McBride faced a barrage of questions from Democrats, including Rep. Cory Williams, who asked what constitutes “compensation” under HB2128.
“I’m sorry, what?” Williams said. “Is it a check? Is it money? Is it staying at somebody’s house? Is it some other benefit conferred?”
“All due respect, we’re supposed to be writing laws. They interpret them. Our laws should have definitions in them,” Williams said.
Rep. Collin Walke bristled at a provision saying an arrest — not necessarily a conviction — is enough to create that liability.
“And if that doesn’t cause you concern as a small-government conservative, that we are punishing legal activity, then I question your status as a small-government conservative,” Walke said.
In Oklahoma, oil and gas are king. The goal of these measures is clear: dissuade protests against oil, gas and pipeline facilities and interests.
But Oklahoma is just the latest example of an attempt to punish protest. At least 19 U.S. states have introduced measures to curb the right to protest since Donald Trump’s election.
In North Carolina, there was a proposal to punish heckling of politicians with five years jail time. In Arizona, legislation was ultimately dropped that would have seized homes and other property from protesters. North Dakota state Rep. Keith Kempenich proposed a bill that would make a driver who hits or kills a protester who is obstructing traffic free from punishment!
This trend even caught the eye of the United Nations. Maina Kiai, UN Special Rapporteur on freedom of peaceful assembly and of association, and David Kaye, UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, issued a report about the wave of anti-protest legislation in the U.S.
“The bills, if enacted into law, would severely infringe upon the exercise of the rights to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in ways that are incompatible with US obligations under international human rights law and with First Amendment protections. The trend also threatens to jeopardize one of the United States’ constitutional pillars: free speech.”
One has to wonder why those in power are so worried about protest. Giant mega-corporations have all the money and influence. Corporate allies and henchmen dominate our legislatures and government offices. It would seem they have all the power. So why punish protest – why not just ignore it?
Because protest works. Even in the face of massive wealth and political influence, protest has the ability to change the conversation, to educate the public, change facts on the ground, and mobilize opposition.
When a police officer shot Michael Brown to death in Ferguson, Missouri in August, 2014, spontaneous protests by local Black young people turned what would have been yet another unnoticed police shooting into a national movement declaring “Black Lives Matter.”
In 2016, thousands of American Indians gathered near Cannonball, North Dakota through summer heat and bitter winter cold, to stand in prayerful opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline project ignored the concerns and sovereignty of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, and bypassed government procedures and environmental regulations. In the end the pipeline went through, but not before winning the hearts and minds of the world and sparking a new upsurge in Native organizing.
On January 21, millions took to the streets of Washington DC and around the world for the Women’s March, setting records for mass protest, one day after the Presidential inauguration. The march galvanized opposition to Trump and reframed his agenda as an affront to the majority of people in the U.S.
Tens of thousands of people have packed town halls and forums across the country to express outrage over GOP plans to gut healthcare for millions. These protests blocked the first attempt to present the bill to repeal healthcare in the House, and derailed the second attempt.
Even though the House passed their “Trumpcare” bill on May 10th, millions are still making their voices heard, and the bill faces massive public opposition as it enters consideration in the Senate.
Corporate apologists, who have bought and sold influence in this country for so long, and their friends in government simply can’t understand there is a kind of power that can’t be bought.
When they see massive turnouts at town halls and in the streets, they imagine it must be paid for, just as they are accustomed to do. But authentic protest is an expression of people’s power – which in the end can’t be stopped with SLAPP suits, fines or “free speech zones.”
During the civil rights movement, thousands of people put their lives and livelihoods on the line to bring about a massive sea change in attitudes. No laws or even violence could turn this tide, once people took hold of protest as their road to change.
We are likely to see more State laws aimed at curbing protest. But we are going to see a lot more protest too. It’s our only option.

Republicans are aglow with the fresh hope of passing sweeping tax cuts. In this B movie, they're swinging an axe every which way. But if we stand firm, we'll make sure their aim on taxes proves as bad as it did against health care.

The defining moment in The Dictator comes when Sacha Baron Cohen sings ‘Ebony and Ivory’ with the decapitated head of a black man. Cohen’s character, the fictional North African dictator General Hafez Aladeen has just snuck into a funeral in Harlem, intent on stealing a beard from the deceased. When Aladeen and his cohort are discovered, they hastily cut off the man’s head, and narrowly escape an angry black mob. Once they’ve returned to their hideout, Aladeen slips his hand inside the lifeless black head and uses it as a puppet to sing a mocking rendition of a song about racial harmony. It’s a sequence that may well define Cohen’s brand of comedy which presumes to irreverently satirise racial attitudes, while appropriating and hiding behind a black or brown mask.
Just as Aladeen is pursued by an angry mob, Cohen often leaves a trail of lawsuits in his wake, once his real-life marks realize they’ve been duped. For many, like Ayman Abu Aita, the Palestinian civilian, smeared as a terrorist in Bruno, and the impoverished Romanian villagers mocked in Borat, there is little recourse. Cohen has the deep pockets of a Hollywood legal team, while the residents of Glod don’t even have running water.
When you want to make it in Hollywood, however, you pick your targets carefully and go through their agents. Only then can you safely teabag Eminem or ‘kidnap’ Pamela Anderson. When in doubt, pick on someone smaller, a C-lister or an old woman and then call it satire.
The Dictator is Cohen’s first film as a Hollywood insider. Too famous to prank anyone with internet access, Cohen has brought his minstrel show out of the realm of Candid Camera verite and into the tamer genre of middlebrow American comedy. He brought his brown masks along with him, but the racial satire is broader than ever before.
As you may have guessed from the marketing assault, Cohen plays General Hafez Aladeen, the tyrannical leader of a fictional North African country called Wadiya. He has a coterie of female bodyguards, outrageous fashion sense, and a penchant for executing anyone who crosses him. The movie follows Aladeen to New York, where he’s meant to address the UN, but due to a political conspiracy, gets replaced with a doppelganger. Aladeen finds refuge in a hippie co-op run by a naive vegan feminist played by Anna Faris. Most of the film’s comedy rehashes Cohen’s ethnic fish out of water template, with Aladeen’s racism and misogyny clashing against the liberal values of his new friends. At one point, Faris offers to take him to visit the ‘rape center’ . You can guess the punchline to that one.
Cohen also plays the doppelganger Efawadh, a dimwitted peasant who, when left in a room with naked women, mistakes them for goats and tries to milk their breasts. He also drinks his own piss in front of a UN Assembly.
Despite its retrograde premise and Arab minstrelsy, The Dictator opened last week to mostly positive reviews, and almost no serious criticism. Mainstream pop culture sites, even those that typically critique racism in the media, were curiously silent. It was a stark contrast to the high profile controversies of the Pop Chips ad featuring Ashton Kutcher in brownface and Billy Crystal’s Sammy Davis shtick at the Oscars. Is this because, as Max Blumenthal tweeted, ‘Some minstrel shows are more popular than others?’
To be fair, there has been some pushback. In an op-ed for CNN, Dean Obeidallah criticised the movie, not because of its racist jokes, but because Cohen is white. ‘If you are going to mock and ridicule us for profit,’ he wrote ‘can you at least cast Arabs and Indians to play us?’ There was also this lengthy essay at Loonwatch and a more blunt assessment at Foreign Policy.
Two days before the film opened, Daily Show correspondent Aasif Mandvi penned a satirical column for Salon attacking Hollywood’s history of whitewashing. His article and the accompanying slideshow called out familiar lowlights like Mickey Rooney as a bucktoothed Japanese neighbor in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, but made no mention of Cohen or The Dictator. When I engaged with Mandvi on Twitter, he denied that The Dictator fit his definition of whitewashing.
Mandvi responded that ‘whitewashing and minstrelsy are separate issues’ and said that he really couldn’t comment on Cohen’s character without seeing the film. (Mandvi has a small part in the movie.) Ultimately, he claimed that the issue was too nuanced for Twitter.
Well, let’s look at those nuances. Below I present the most common defenses of The Dictator and my thoughts on them.
Perhaps anticipating charges of minstrelsy, early in the film, Cohen has Aladeen deny that he is an Arab. Racial ambiguity has been a hallmark of Cohen’s shtick ever since Ali G, harassed by an authority figure, asked ‘Is it because I is black?’
But there’s no mistaking the inspiration for this character. A map in the movie situates Aladeen’s homeland of Wadiya directly to the east of Sudan. Cohen has said that the film was inspired by a novel penned by Saddam Hussein. Aladeen is also clearly meant to resemble the late Muammar Gaddafi. There’s also a hint of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, as the film’s timely plot concerns Wadiya’s enrichment of uranium ‘for peaceful purposes’ .
Though Wadiya is clearly an Arab country, the film follows Hollywood’s Orientalist playbook, mixing Persian, Arab and South Asian performers and cultural references. The central Arab characters are played by Cohen, Ben Kingsley (who is part Indian) and Jason Manzoukas (a Greek American.) The movie’s theme song is by Punjabi MC, a British Indian musician.
This is one of the slipperiest defenses offered for racist humor – that it’s not really racist, but rather ironically commenting on racism. The claim almost always deserves scrutiny. First of all, if this were true, The Dictator would not have found such popularity among racists, as these tweets demonstrate. OK, you might say, perhaps Cohen’s satire goes over the heads of your average American racist. But this ignores the thorny nature of ironic humor. In the film, Aladeen refers to black people as ‘subsaharans’ and ‘blackies’ . The white liberal audience laughs (mine did). Are they laughing at Aladeen’s ignorance? At the violation of hearing a racial slur? Do they recognize their own racism in the character?
In one scene, Aladeen remarks that darker-skinned men have lower sexual standards in women. The audience laughs again, as if the joke has revealed an uncomfortable ‘politically incorrect’ truth, rather than pandered to a racist stereotype. Ironic racism lets audiences have our cake and eat it too. It gives us permission to laugh at the violation of a racist joke, while comforting us that we do not share the same toxic attitudes.
Most of the film’s humor – the racial caricatures, the creepy attacks on feminism, the numerous rape jokes and the gay stereotypes have a similar thorniness. We’re invited to laugh at their wrongness but allowed to feel superior to such backwards attitudes, because we’re good liberals who know better, while the (brown) characters in the movie are savages.
It’s true that in The Dictator, as in his previous work, Cohen’s humor relies heavily on anti-Semitic jokes. But here, as in Borat, he’s attributing those sentiments to the ethnic Other. Cohen doesn’t really mock Jews. In fact, he makes a caricature of the Other’s anti-Semitism. Borat, for instance, was a vicious anti-Semite whose village in Kazakhstan held an annual ‘Running of the Jews’. This gag was based on a lie, because anti-Semitism in Kazakhstan is actually quite rare. One of the deeper ironies of the village sequence is that Borat was also racist against ‘Gypsies’. And yet, Cohen the prankster had no reservations about exploiting the people of Glod to make the film.
Even in Cohen’s most notorious stunt, in which Borat led a bar full of ‘rednecks’ in a singalong of ‘Throw the Jew Down the Well’, it’s unclear how much he revealed about actual anti-Semitism. Though what we saw onscreen was a room full of rural white Americans cheerfully singing about killing Jews, follow-up reports suggest that many of the patrons were in on the joke.
In any case, if Cohen were really an equal opportunity satirist, he would pick more challenging targets. His frat-boy style satire doesn’t tip any sacred cows, for instance, when it comes to Israel. Cohen, an Orthodox Jew who was raised in the Zionist Habonim Dror, rarely criticises Israel and its policies. Instead, his comedy exaggerates anti-Semitism, while also attributing violence, homophobia and misogyny to the Muslim Other. It’s pinkwashing as comedy.
Yes, in the film’s penultimate scene, Aladeen gives a speech in which he inadvertently argues that America with its income inequality, media consolidation and disproportionate imprisonment of African Americans already has the hallmarks of a dictatorship. It’s the movie’s only attempt at critiquing a first world target, but it mostly feels like pandering to Obama liberals.
The Dictator is not the work of a radical satirist, but of an establishment court jester. If Cohen’s political sympathies are at all in doubt, check out his social media team’s obnoxious linkbait at Buzzfeed, where Evo Morales is branded as a ‘dictator’ mocked for wearing traditional Andean clothing (seems they’ve silently edited this since I tweeted about it) and where Hugo Chavez finds himself in a rogue’s gallery with Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini and Kim Jong-Il.
The Dictator has much in common with voyeuristic spectacles like Boobquake and Draw Muhammad Day, in which Western liberals engaged in Islamophobia while purporting to defend feminism and free speech.
Cohen probably thinks he’s Charlie Chaplin lampooning Hitler, but of course Hitler was still on top of the world when The Great Dictator came out in 1940; Cohen is actually Chaplin’s antithesis, a first-world bully content to target the Other.
Whatever you think of The Dictator, it does not arrive in a cultural vacuum. It finds us, instead, at the ‘end’ of a bloody and illegal war that had grave consequences for the people of Iraq. It appears as we are ‘winding down’ our long war in Afghanistan. And while we rattle sabers with Iran. It follows Obama’s, um, ‘unauthorized bombing’ of Libya (Wadiya’s most obvious inspiration) which led to the eventual capture, rape and execution of Gaddafi.
The film’s release coincides with a new era of drone warfare against Arabs and Muslims, of faceless warriors dropping remote control bombs on Pakistan and Yemen. It arrives in an era of presidential kill lists, indefinite detention and omnipresent surveillance of Muslim Americans. It opens while liberals boast about the one-year anniversary of President Obama’s success in putting a due process-free bullet in Osama bin Laden’s face. In short, Cohen’s minstrel show comes in the midst of a period of peak violence against Arabs and Muslims.
There is no war without culture war, and Cohen’s Dictator shtick has the dubious function of allowing us to laugh at (or perhaps justify) our recent and ongoing crimes of war and racial profiling. After Cohen smeared Abu Aita as a terrorist in Bruno, he perpetrated the lie in an interview with David Letterman while out of character. Branding ordinary Palestinians as terrorists to further your own agenda? That’s what bullying governments do. It is not the stuff of satire.

Well, moral outrage is Cohen’s most effective megaphone. Bigots may have their poisonous views reinforced but I doubt his rubbish will convert anyone to such views. Just another deadening tentacle of the reactionary pop culture mash cloaked in “irony”. I won’t be losing sleep waiting for him to lampoon an Israeli settler.
Boris I kind of disagree. I know a few people who, while not out and out bigots, will see this film as further legitimising their tendencies in that direction. Perhaps mainly because its only in this ‘ironic’ and ‘funny’ medium that they feel free to express and revel in racism.
Excellent piece! It raises a question: how is this actually possible? How can someone like Cohen purport to be a liberal engaging in satire when he is really a court jester for the establishment, as you put it? I reckon answering it requires us to face up to one of the ideological fundaments of late capitalism (which is why this is an excellent piece).
Cohen occupies a problematic ideological position, and invites us to laugh in a complex fashion. On the surface it would seem that he portrays racist fantasies/stereotypes that we ‘don’t really believe in’ in a way that lampoons those stereotypical fantasies and the people who hold them. In that sense he would appear to be a good liberal satirising racism. As the response to this most recent film demonstrates, however, this is actually too quick, and the complexity and level of irony do not simply cancel out the deep racism (I actually think this has been the case with Cohen for years and, though I haven’t seen The Dictator yet, it seems like a line has been crossed here, and he is starting to show himself for what he always was). There’s something very interesting happening here to belief, to how we believe we believe. Cohen’s work is evidence of a shift.
In this respect it is similar to the work of Trey Parker and Matt Stone. What’s difficult about a show like South Park or a film like Team America is the slipperiness of the ideological position, but (like Cohen) they are often simply defended on the grounds that they ‘have a go at everyone’. As you pointed out in our recent Twitter conversation, Matt, Team America ends with a militaristic paean to America’s role as international policeman. The fact that that paean is delivered ironically, indeed obscenely (it is basically an extended dick joke), is actually part of its content: the lesson is that we don’t have to ‘really believe’ in something to be ideologically wedded to it. Soldiers of past generations have gotten revved by watching anti-war films like Full Metal Jacket, ignoring the ideological content and simply soaking up the violence; in Iraq they cranked America: Fuck Yeah! in their tanks, a song that is actually a joke that isn’t really a joke at all. Or rather, the joke is the message, and the message is America: Fuck Yeah!
I’m reminded of this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uh4U-Tbqbx4. As the cutting makes abundantly clear, there are two presidents here: the one who gravely warns the American people of the lethal weapons hidden by Saddam Hussein, and the one who comes along afterwards to joke obscenely at his expense. The first president possesses (or pretends to possess) both power and authority. The second president is brazenly acknowledging his lack of the latter, but in a way that does not call his possession of the former into question. What we are witnessing is a break in the link between power and authority; it is now possible to have one without the other. It’s a terrifying thought, actually: we don’t – indeed maybe we can’t – ‘really’ believe in power, but we exercise it with impunity in spite of that fact (or, more terrifying still, perhaps because of it).
Thanks for expanding on your tweets here, Matthew. I think you’re onto something about the contradictions inherent in “ironic” humor like this. It reminds me of Zizek’s observations about ideology as something that reveals itself through what we do, even as, in the case of capitalism, we disavow our belief in it. (If I’m understanding his point.)
We’re at a point where much of popular culture comes with its own prefab auto-critique, as if it’s anticipating and neutralizing challenges in advance. David Foster Wallace wrote about this phenomenon in advertising back in the 90s, but you could well apply it to most cultural products, perhaps especially to humor. So I think your question about the function of irony in late capitalism is a big one, and worth exploring.
Your observation about Bush is an interesting one. It also makes me think a bit of Obama’s joke about killing the
Jonas Brothers with drones, although obviously in that case, the joke isn’t really at his own expense.
We need to win, once again, an argument about racism. IMO, for many people, racism has come to mean a set of ideas held only by a minority of evil cranks. Because of that, they find it almost impossible to accept that anti-Arab bigotry constitutes racism, on the basis that such notions are so widespread and so normalised.

I find deciding what to cook is one of the hardest things about going camping. Yet going camping doesn’t have to mean baked beans on toast, or firing up the BBQ every evening. If you are like me, you don’t want to be slaving over the BBQ whilst everyone else is outside enjoying the evening. I want to go off – like everyone else – for a shower after a day on the beach, and enjoy a cool beer watching the sun go down. More importantly, feeding the kids before they start crying with hunger is conducive to a stress-free camping holiday! So, with the help of other experienced campers, I have put together this list of the best quick and easy camping meal ideas. I guarantee you there will be something for everyone. In addition, not may ingredients are required, meaning you don’t have to worry about storage space.
Don’t worry about that. Despite them being awesome, these meals do not require a high degree of cooking expertise. All you need is a few bits and pieces, such as a BBQ, (we use a Cadac), a stove, a pan, a wooden spoon, and a tin opener. There are a couple of others bits, but that is dependant on the meals you choose from the list below. So as promised, here is your list of the best quick and easy camping meal ideas.
Pea and Bacon Risotto – I do this using the wok but you can make this in a normal camping pan as well. Fry off the bacon – I prefer smoked – add a bit of garlic and the risotto rice. Make sure the rice is coated and then add your stock and water. Turn down the gas and just leave to bubble. Add the peas towards the end, and then sprinkle with cheese just as you serve and stir it in.
Butterflied Chicken and Bacon Burgers – It is just a nice change to the normal beef option. Butterflying the chicken means it cooks in half the time.
Chilli – Quite simply one of the easiest and best loved meal ideas to cook up when camping. Laura makes hers and freezes it up beforehand. It defrosts on the journey ready to eat that evening. Genius!
Fondue – This suggestion is very different, yet what a really sociable meal idea. Polly reckons it is great in the evenings and her kids love the dipping element and the cheese.
Fajitas – You could use the left over chilli from the earlier suggestion, or make a chicken variety – Kelly
Filled Jacket Potatoes – Prick the jackets, wrap in foil and put directly into the coals or fire to bake. Alex takes grated cheese and various toppings in little Tupperware pots – her favourite is chilli but the kids always love beans and cheese!
Home made pizza – This one requires a pizza stone plate for the Cadac. Tracey buys a pizza base and then tops it with any left-over ingredients in the fridge.
Campfire Salmon – This suggestion from Megan is awesome and not something you think possible, but it is. It is so easy that it blew my mind. I tried this at the weekend and it is a must-have! Get all of your ingredients together (I had pak choi and spring onions), layer them up in a piece of foil and lay the salmon on top. Wrap in newspaper and tie it up in to a parcel. Make sure you get the paper wet and then place on a rack just above the coals.
Witches Stew – Brilliant idea from Jade as you can use up the left-overs from breakfast. All you need is bacon, sausages, baked beans, tinned tomatoes and a bit of Worcester sauce all in the same pan. Serve with a crusty rolls, perfect!
And as a little treat why not try this little beauty for pudding suggested by Emma – Bananas and chocolate wrapped in foil – Yum!
If you are heading off for a week then there is more than enough there to go with. Pick and choose as you like. To be honest with that list – and a few ingredient substitutions – you could keep going for a fortnight. All that’s left to do is write the shopping list, go out and buy it, organise the cooking equipment and off you go. Have a great trip and come back and let me know how you got on.
If you have any other quick and easy meal suggestions please fee free to leave me a comment so I can add it to the list. I love hearing new ideas.

The details of our academic program are outlined throughout our school's website and brochure. The building was later torn down, and that plot of land has since become a parking lot. Commitment Pathway Center for College & Career Readiness The vision of Talladega County Schools is to provide an engaging, rigorous curriculum empowering all students to be college and career ready. The faculty and staff is equipped with enthusiastic and exceptional professionals that actively participate in professional development for using these 21st century tools with their students. Comer Memorial High School is for every student to be fully prepared to meet the challenges of college or a career after high school. Alabama's Plan 2020 states a college and career ready school provides students with the knowledge and skills needed to enroll and succeed in credit-bearing, first-year courses at a postsecondary institution, such as a two- or four-year college, trade school, or technical school without the need for remediation. It was housed in what later became the Avondale Mills Credit Union building.When one political party holds the governor's office and a majority in both houses of the state legislature, the state is governed by a state government trifecta.Prior to the November 2016 general election, Alabama was one of 23 Republican state government trifectas.His barked orders and put-on baritone are all part of the package, and can strike an observer as funny.At least until you remember this guy is trying to turn the country into an all-white gated community. In a five to four decision, the Supreme Court ruled that opposition to homosexuality is part of BSA's "expressive message" and that allowing homosexuals as adult leaders would interfere with that message.
The school's infrastructure has been updated to accommodate the school's 21st century transformation.According to those who know Miller’s history, that’s not so far off the mark.Dating back to junior high school, Miller has been the unwavering right-winger now before us.In 1937 a new building was built as a Public Works Administration project at the cost of 1,965.
Fifty-five percent of this amount and eighteen acres of land were donated by Avondale Mills.At the time of the case, it asserted that homosexuality was inconsistent with those values.

A republic is a form of government in which the head of state is not a monarch and the people (or at least a part of its people) have an impact on its government. The word 'republic' is derived from the Latin phrase res publica which can be translated as "a public affair".
Both modern and ancient republics vary widely in their ideology and composition. The most common definition of a republic is a state without a monarch. In republics such as the United States and France the executive is legitimated both by a constitution and by popular suffrage. In the United States, Founding Fathers like James Madison defined republic in terms of representative democracy as opposed to only having direct democracy, and this usage is still employed by many viewing themselves as "republicans". In modern political science, republicanism refers to a specific ideology that is based on civic virtue and is considered distinct from ideologies such as liberalism.
Most often a republic is a sovereign country, but there are also subnational entities that are referred to as republics. For instance, Article IV of the Constitution of the United States "guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government." The Soviet Union was a single nation composed of distinct and legally sovereign Soviet Socialist Republics.
Niccolò Machiavelli described the governance and foundation of the ideal republic in his work Discourses on Livy. These writings, as well as those of his contemporaries such as Leonardo Bruni, are the foundation of the ideology political scientists call republicanism.
The idea of a republic first appeared in the writings of Italian scholars of the Renaissance, most importantly Niccolò Machiavelli. Machiavelli divided governments into two types, principalities ruled by a monarch and republics ruled by the people.
In medieval Northern Italy a number of city states had commune or signoria based governments. In the late Middle Ages writers, such as Giovanni Villani, began thinking about the nature of these states and the differences from the more common monarchies. These early writers used terms such as libertas populi to describe the states. The terminology changed in the 15th century as the renewed interest in the writings of Ancient Greece and Rome caused writers to prefer using classical terminology. To describe non-monarchial states writers, most importantly Leonardo Bruni, adopted the Latin word res publica.
While Bruni and Machiavelli used the term to describe the non-monarchial states of Northern Italy, res publica has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin. The term can quite literally be translated as 'public matter.' It was most often used by Roman writers to refer to the state and government, even during the period of the Roman Empire. The English word commonwealth derives from a direct translation of res publica, and its use in English is closer to how the Romans used the term res publica.
Niccolò Machiavelli defined republic in The Prince by stating that "all states, all the dominions that have had or now have authority over men have been and now are either republics or princedoms." Today the term republic still most commonly means a system of government which derives its power from the people rather than from another basis, such as heredity or divine right. This remains the primary definition of republic in most contexts.
This bipartite division of government types differs from the classical sources, and also the earlier of Machiavelli's own works, which divided governments into three types, monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. As Machiavelli wrote, the distinction between an aristocracy ruled by a select elite and a democracy ruled by a council appointed by the people became cumbersome. By the time Machiavelli began work on The Prince he had decided to refer to both aristocracy and democracies as republics.
A further set of meanings for the term comes from the Greek word politeia. Cicero, among other Latin writers, translated politeia as res publica and it was in turn translated by Renaissance scholars as republic. This is not a very accurate translation and the term politeia is today usually translated as form of government or regime. One continued use of this archaic translation is the title of Plato's major work on political science. In Greek it was titled Politeia and in English is thus known as The Republic. This naming is preserved for historic reasons, but is not considered accurate. Within the text of modern translations of The Republic alternative translations of politeia are used.
In English the word first came to prominence during The Protectorate era of Oliver Cromwell. While commonwealth was the most common term to call the new monarchless state, republic was also in common use.
Until modern times, the form of government for almost all states was monarchy. During the classical period the Mediterranean region was home to several states that are now known as the classical republics.
Several republics also developed during the Middle Ages in the merchant dominated city states. Beginning in the 18th century larger states began becoming republics, and in the 21st century only a minority of countries are monarchies.
The concept of the "republic" itself was not a meaningful concept in the classical world. There are number of states of the classical era that are today by convention called republics. These include the city states of ancient Greece such as Athens and Sparta and the Roman Republic. The structure and governance of these states was very different from that of any modern republic. There is a debate about whether the classical, medieval, and modern republics form a historic continuum. JGA Pocock has played a central role, arguing that there is a distinct republican traditional that stretches from the classical world to the present. Other scholars disagree. Paul Rahe, for instance, argues that the classical republics had a form of government with few links to those in any modern country.
The political philosophy of the classical republics has had a central influence on republican thought throughout the subsequent centuries. A number of classical writers discussed forms of government alternative to monarchies and later writers have treated these as foundational works on the nature of republics. Philosophers and politicians advocating for republics, such as Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Adams, and Madison, relied heavily on these sources.
Aristotle's Politics discusses various forms of government. One form Aristotle named politeia consisted of a mixture of the other forms he argued this was one of the ideal forms of government. Polybius expanded on many of these ideas, again focusing on the idea of mixed government. The most important Roman work in this tradition is Cicero's De re publica.
Over time the classical republics were either conquered by empires or became one themselves. Most of the Greek republics were annexed to the Macedonian Empire of Alexander. The Roman Republic expanded dramatically conquering the other states of the Mediterranean that could be considered republics, such as Carthaginian Republic. The Roman Republic itself then became the Roman Empire.
In the pre-modern period republics are generally considered to have been a solely European phenomenon, and states in other parts of the world with similar governments are not generally referred to as republics. Some early states outside of Europe had governments that are sometimes today considered similar to republics. In the ancient Near East, a number of cities of the Eastern Mediterranean achieved collective rule. Arwad has been cited as one of the earliest known examples of a republic, in which the people, rather than a monarch, are described as sovereign. The Israelite confederation of the era before the United Monarchy has also been considered a type of republic.
One part of the world where much attention has been paid ancient republics is India . In the early 20th century a number of Indian scholars, most notably as KP Jayaswal, argued that a number of states of ancient India had republican forms of government. Unlike in Greece there are no surviving constitutions or works of political philosophy from this period in Indian history. The forms of government thus need to be deduced, mostly from the surviving religious texts. These texts do refer to a number of states having Gaṇa sangha, or council based, as opposed to monarchial governments.
A second form of evidence comes from Greeks writing about India during the period of contact following the conquests of Alexander. Greek writers about India such as Megasthenes and Arrian describe many of the states there to have republican governments akin to those of Greece. Beginning around 700 BCE republics developed in a band running along the Indus Valley in the northwest and along the Ganges Plain in the northeast. They were mainly small states, though some confederations of republics seem to have formed that covered large areas, such as Vajji, which had Vaishali as its capital around 600 BCE .
As in Greece, the republican era came to an end in the 4th century with the rise of a monarchial empire. The Maurya Empire conquered almost the entire subcontinent, ending the autonomy of the small republics. Some did remain republics under Mauryan suzerainty, or returned to being republics after the fall of the empire. Madra, for instance, survived as a republic until the 4th century CE. The final end of republics in India came with the rise of the Gupta Empire, and an associated philosophy of the divine nature of monarchy.
In Europe new republics appeared in the late Middle Ages when a number of small states embraced republican systems of government. These were generally small, but wealthy, trading states in which the merchant class had risen to prominence. Haakonssen notes that by the Renaissance Europe was divided with those states controlled by a landed elite being monarchies and those controlled by a commercial elite being republics.
Across Europe a wealthy merchant class developed in the important trading cities. Despite their wealth they had little power in the feudal system dominated by the rural land owners, and across Europe began to advocate for their own privileges and powers. The more centralized states, such as France and England, granted limited city charters.
In the more loosely governed Holy Roman Empire fifty-one of the largest towns became free imperial cities. While still under the dominion of the Holy Roman Emperor most power was held locally and many adopted republican forms of government. The same rights to imperial immediacy were secured by the major trading cities of Switzerland . The towns and villages of alpine Switzerland had, courtesy of geography, also been largely excluded from central control. Unlike Italy and Germany much of the rural area was thus not controlled by feudal barons, but instead by independent farmers who also used communal forms of government. When the Habsburgs tried to reassert control over the region both rural farmers and town merchants joined the rebellion. The Swiss were victorious, and the Swiss Confederacy was proclaimed, and Switzerland has retained a republican form of government to the present.
Italy was the most densely populated area of Europe, and also one with the weakest central government. Many of the towns thus gained considerable independence and adopted commune forms of government. Completely free of feudal control, the Italian city-states expanded, gaining control of the rural hinterland. The two most powerful were the Republic of Venice and its rival the Republic of Genoa. Each were large trading ports, and further expanded by using naval power to control large parts of the Mediterranean. It was in Italy that an ideology advocating for republics first developed. Writers such as Bartholomew of Lucca, Brunetto Latini, Marsilius of Padua, and Leonardo Bruni saw the medieval city-states as heirs to the legacy of Greece and Rome.
The dominant form of government for these early republics was control by a limited council of elite patricians. In those areas that held elections, property qualifications or guild membership limited both who could vote and who could run. In many states no direct elections were held and council members were hereditary or appointed by the existing council. This left the great majority of the population without political power, and riots and revolts by the lower classes were common. The late Middle Ages saw more than two hundred such risings in the towns of the Holy Roman Empire. Similar revolts occurred in Italy, notably the Ciompi Revolt in Florence.
While the classical writers had been the primary ideological source for the republics of Italy, in Northern Europe the Protestant Reformation would be used as justification for a new set up republics. Most important was Calvinist theology, which developed in the Swiss Confederacy, one of the largest and most powerful of the medieval republics. John Calvin did not call for the abolition of monarchy, but he advanced the doctrine that the faithful had the right to overthrow irreligious monarchs. Calvinism also espoused a fierce egalitarianism and an opposition to hierarchy. Advocacy for republics appeared in the writings of the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion
Calvinism played an important role in the republican revolts in Britain and the Netherlands. Like the city-states of Italy and the Hanseatic League both were important trading centres, with a large merchant class prospering from the trade with the New World. Large parts of the population of both areas also embraced Calvinism. The Dutch Revolt, beginning in 1568, saw the Dutch Republic reject the rule of Hapsburg Spain in a long conflict that would last until 1648.
In 1641 the English Civil War began. Spearheaded by the Puritans and funded by the merchants of London the revolt was a success, and King Charles I was executed. In England James Harrington, Algernon Sydney, and John Milton became some of the first writers to argue for rejecting monarchy and embracing a republican form of government. The English Commonwealth was short lived, and the monarchy soon restored. The Dutch Republic continued in name until 1795, but by the mid 18th century the stadholder had become a de facto monarch. Calvinists were also some of the earliest settlers of the British and Dutch colonies of North America.
As well these initial republican revolts early modern Europe also saw a great increase in monarchial power. The era of absolute monarchy replaced the limited and decentralized monarchies that had existed in most of the Middle Ages. It also saw a reaction against the total control of the monarch as a series of writers created the ideology known as liberalism.
Most of these Enlightenment thinkers were far more interested in ideas of constitutional monarchy than in republics. The Cromwell regime had discredited republicanism, and most thinkers felt that republics ended in either anarchy or tyranny. Thus philosophers like Voltaire opposed absolutism while at the same time being strongly pro-monarchy.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu did praise republics, and looked on the city-states of Greece as a model, but both also felt that a nation-state like France, with 20 million people, would be impossible to govern as a republic. Rousseau described his ideal political structure of small self governing communes. Montesquieu felt that a city-state should ideally be a republic, but maintained that a limited monarchy was better suited to a large nation.
The American Revolution thus began as a rejection only of the authority of the English parliament over the colonies. With the Declaration of Independence the leaders of the revolt firmly embraced republicanism. The leaders of the revolution were well versed in the writings of the French liberal thinkers, and also in history of the classical republics. John Adams had notably written a book on republics throughout history.
The French Revolution was also not republican at its outset. Only after the Flight to Varennes removed most of the remaining sympathy for the king was a republic declared and Louis XVI sent to the guillotine. The stunning success of France in the French Revolutionary Wars saw republics spread by force of arms across much of Europe as a series of client republics were set up across the continent. The rise of Napoleon saw the end of the First French Republic, and his eventual defeat allowed the victorious monarchies to put an end to many of the oldest republics on the continent, including Venice, Genoa, and the Dutch.
Outside of Europe another group of republics was created as the Napoleonic Wars allowed the states of Latin America to gain their independence. Liberal ideology had only a limited impact on these new republics. The main impetus was the local European descended Creole population in conflict with the Peninsulares governors sent from overseas. The majority of the population in most of Latin America was of either African or Amerindian decent, and the Creole elite had little interest in giving these groups power and broad based popular sovereignty. Simón Bolívar was both the main instigator of the revolts and one of its most important theorists was sympathetic to liberal ideals, but felt that Latin America lacked the social cohesion for such a system to function and advocated autocracy as necessary.
In Mexico this autocracy briefly took the form of a monarchy in the First Mexican Empire. Due to the Peninsular War, Portuguese court was relocated to Barsil in 1808. Brazil gained independence as a monarchy in September 7, 1822, and the Empire of Brazil lasted until 1889. In the other states various forms of autocratic republic existed until most were liberalized at the end of the 20th century.
19th century France would see the creation of the briefly lived Second French Republic in 1848 and Third French Republic in 1871. Spain saw the briefly lived First Spanish Republic, but the monarchy was soon restored. By the start of the 20th century France and Switzerland remained the only republics in Europe. Before the First World War, Portuguese Republic, established by the revolution of October, 5, 1910, was the first of the 20th Century. This would encourage new republics in the aftermath of the First World War when several of the largest European empires collapsed. The German Empire , Austro-Hungarian Empire, Russian Empire , and Ottoman Empire were then replaced by republics. New states gained independence during this turmoil, and many of these, such as Ireland, Poland, Finland and Czechoslovakia , chose republican forms of government. In 1931, the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939) turned into a civil war would be the prelude of the Second World War.
Republican ideas were spreading, importantly to Asia. The United States began to have considerable influence in East Asia in the later part of the 19th century, with Protestant missionaries playing a central role. The liberal and republican writers of the west also exerted influence. These combined with native Confucian inspired political philosophy that had long argued that the populace had the right to reject unjust government that had lost the Mandate of Heaven.
Two short lived republics were proclaimed in East Asia, the Republic of Formosa and the First Philippine Republic. China had seen considerable anti-Qing sentiment, and a number of protest movements developed calling for constitutional monarchy. The most important leader of these efforts was Sun Yat-sen whose Three Principles of the People combined American, European, and Chinese ideas. The Republic of China was proclaimed on January 1, 1912.
Strictly speaking, any real or hypothetical state organized along the principles of socialism may be called a socialist state.The term socialist republic is used by those socialists who wish to emphasize that they favour a republican form of government. Furthermore, since socialism purports to represent the interests of the working class, many socialists refer to a state organized according to their principles as a workers' state.
Communist states such as Vietnam require that their leaders adhere to that ideology and to the line of the Communist party.

The years after the Second World War saw most of the remaining European colonies gain their independence, and most became republics. The two largest colonial powers were France and the United Kingdom. Republican France encouraged the establishment of republics in its former colonies. Great Britain attempted to follow the model it had for its earlier settler colonies of creating independent commonwealth realms still linked under the same monarchy. While most of the settler colonies and the smaller states of the Caribbean retained this system, it was rejected by the newly independent countries in Africa and Asia who revised their constitutions and became republics.
In the Middle East Britain followed a different model. It installed local monarchies in several colonies and mandates including Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen, and Libya. In subsequent decades revolutions and coups overthrew a number of monarchs and installed republics. Several monarchies remain, and the Middle East is the only part of the world where several large states are ruled by monarchs with almost complete political control.
Islamic political philosophy has a long history of opposition to absolute monarchy, notably in the work of Al-Farabi. The law, sharia, took precedence over the will of the ruler, and electing rulers by means of the Shura was an important doctrine. While the early caliphate maintained the principles of an elected ruler, later states became hereditary or military dictatorships though many maintained some pretense of a consultative shura.
None of these states are typically referred to as republics. The current usage of republic in Muslim countries is borrowed from the western meaning, adopted into the language in the late 19th century. The 20th century saw republicanism become an important idea in much of the Middle East as monarchies were removed in many states of the region. Some such as Iraq and Turkey became secular republics. In Iran the Iranian Revolution overthrew the monarchy and created an Islamic Republic based the ideas of Islamic democracy.
With no monarch, most modern republics use the title president for the head of state. Originally used to refer to the presiding officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain the usage was also applied to political leaders, including the leaders of some of the Thirteen Colonies (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the "President of the Council." The first republic to adopt the title was the United States of America . Keeping its usage as the head of a committee the President of the Continental Congress was the leader of the original congress. When the new constitution was written the title of President of the United States was conferred on the head of the new executive branch. Today almost all republics use the title president for the head of state.
If the head of state of a republic is also the head of government, this is called a presidential system. There are a number of forms of presidential government. A full-presidential system has a president with substantial authority and a central political role. The United States was the first example of such a system, and the basis for the model adopted elsewhere. In other states the legislature is dominant and the president's role is almost purely ceremonial and apolitical, such as in Germany and India .
These states are parliamentary republics and operate similarly to constitutional monarchies with parliamentary systems where the power of the monarch is also greatly circumscribed. In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power. Semi-presidential systems have a president as an active head of state, but also have a head of government with important powers.
The rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France , when the members of the ruling cabinet and the president come from opposing political factions, this situation is called cohabitation.
In some countries, like Switzerland and San Marino , the head of state is not a single person but a committee (council) of several persons holding that office. The Roman Republic had two consuls, appointed for a year.
In liberal democracies presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council. Typically in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people, or is indirectly elected as done in the United States. In that country the president is officially elected by an electoral college, chosen by the States, all of which do so by direct election of the electors. The indirect election of the president through the electoral college conforms to the concept of republic as one with a system of indirect election. In the opinion of some, direct election confers legitimacy upon the president and gives the office much of its political power. However, this concept of legitimacy differs from that expressed in the United States Constitution which established the legitimacy of the United States president as resulting from the signing of the Constitution by 9 states. The idea that direct election is required for legitimacy also contradicts the spirit of the Great Compromise, whose actual result was manifest in the clause that provides voters in smaller states with slightly more representation in presidential selection than those in large states.
In states with a parliamentary system the president is usually elected by the parliament. This indirect elections subordinates the president to the parliament, and also gives the president limited legitimacy and turns most presidential powers into reserve powers that can only be exercised under rare circumstance. There are exceptions where elected presidents have only ceremonial powers, such as in the Republic of Ireland .
The distinction between a republic and a monarchy are not always clear. The constitutional monarchies of the former British Empire and Western Europe today have almost all real political power vested in the elected representatives, with the monarchs only holding theoretical and rarely used reserve powers. Real legitimacy for political decisions comes from the elected representatives and is derived from the will of the people. While hereditary monarchies remain in place, political power is derived from the people as in a republic. These states are thus sometimes referred to as crowned republics.
There are also self proclaimed republics that act similarly to monarchies with absolute power vested in the leader and passed down from father to son. North Korea and Syria are two notable examples where a son has inherited political control. Neither of these states are officially monarchies. There is no constitutional requirement that power be passed down within one family, but it has occurred in practice.
There are also elective monarchy where ultimate power is vested in a monarch, but the monarch is chosen by some manner of election. A current example of such a state is Malaysia where the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected every five years by the Conference of Rulers composed of the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states. While rare today, elective monarchs were common in the past. The Holy Roman Empire is an important example, where each new emperor was chosen by a group of electors. Islamic states also rarely employed primogeniture instead relying on various forms of election to chose a monarchs successor.
The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had an elective monarchy, with a wide suffrage of some 500,000 nobles. The system, known as the Golden Liberty, had developed as a method for powerful landowners to control the crown. The proponents of this system looked to classical examples, and the writings of the Italian Renaissance, and called their elective monarchy a rzeczpospolita, based on res publica.

In the early 21st century, most states that are not monarchies label themselves as republics either in their official names or their constitutions. There are a few exceptions: the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Israel and the Russian Federation. Israel, Russia, and Libya would meet many definitions of the term republic, however.
Since the term republic is so vague by itself, many states felt it necessary to add additional qualifiers in order to clarify what kind of republics they claim to be. Here is a list of such qualifiers and variations on the term "republic":
Parliamentary republic — a republic, like India , Bangladesh , with an elected Head of state, but where the Head of state and Head of government are kept separate with the Head of government retaining most executive powers, or a Head of state akin to a Head of government, elected by a Parliament.
Federal republic, confederation or federation — a federal union of states or provinces with a republican form of government. Examples include Argentina , Austria , Brazil , Germany , India , Russia and Switzerland .
Islamic Republic — Countries like Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran are republics governed in accordance with Islamic law. (Note: Turkey is a distinct exception and is not included in this list; while the population is predominantly Muslim, the state is a staunchly secular republic.)
Arab Republic — for example, Syria its name reflecting its theoretically pan-Arab Ba'athist government.
People's Republic — Countries like China , Vietnam are meant to be governed for and by the people, but with indirect elections. The term People's Republic is used to differential themselves from the earlier republic of their countries before the people's revolution, like Republic of China and Republic of Korea.
Democratic Republic — Tends to be used by countries who have a particular desire to emphasize their claim to be democratic; these are typically Communist states and/or ex-colonies. Examples include the German Democratic Republic (no longer in existence) and the Democratic Republic of the Congo .
Commonwealth (Rzeczpospolita) — Both words (English and Polish) are derived from the Latin word res publica (literally "common affairs"). Used for both the current Republic of Poland , and the old Nobility Commonwealth. Apart from the Polish term, it should be noted that some subnational entities with republican governments (e.g. Virginia and Puerto Rico), as well as some sovereign monarchies (e.g. Australia and The Bahamas ), also style themselves "commonwealths."
Free state — Sometimes used as a label to indicate implementation of, or transition from a monarchical to, a republican form of government. Used for the Irish Free State (1922–1937) under an Irish Republican government, while still remaining associated with the British Empire.
Venezuela has been using, since the adoption of the 1999 constitution, the title of Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.
Other modifiers are rooted in tradition and history and usually have no real political meaning. San Marino , for instance, is the "Most Serene Republic" while Uruguay is "República Oriental", which implies it lies on the eastern bank of the Uruguay River.
In general being a republic also implies sovereignty as for the state to be ruled by the people it cannot be controlled by a foreign power. There are important exceptions to this, for example, Republics in the Soviet Union were member states which had to meet three criteria to be named republics:
be on the periphery of the Soviet Union so as to be able to take advantage of their theoretical right to secede;
be named after at least one million people of the ethnic group which should make up the majority population of said republic.
Republics were originally created by Stalin and continue to be created even today in Russia. Russia itself is not a republic but a federation.It is sometimes argued that the former Soviet Union was also a supra-national republic, based on the claim that the member states were different nations.
States of the United States are required, like the federal government, to be republican in form, with final authority resting with the people. This was required because the states were intended to create and enforce most domestic laws, with the exception of areas delegated to the federal government and prohibited to the states. The founding fathers of the country intended most domestic laws to be handled by the states, although, over time, the federal government has gained more and more influence over domestic law. Requiring the states to be a republic in form was seen as protecting the citizens' rights and preventing a state from becoming a dictatorship or monarchy, and reflected unwillingness on the part of the original 13 states (all independent republics) to unite with other states that were not republics. Additionally, this requirement ensured that only other republics could join the union.
In the example of the United States , the original 13 British colonies became independent states after the American Revolution, each having a republican form of government. These independent states initially formed a loose confederation called the United States and then later formed the current United States by ratifying the current U.S. Constitution, creating a union of sovereign states with the union or federal government also being a republic. Any state joining the union later was also required to be a republic.
The term republic originated from the writers of the Renaissance as a descriptive term for states that were not monarchies. These writers, such as Machiavelli, also wrote important prescriptive works describing how such governments should function. These ideas of how a government and society should be structured is the basis for an ideology known as classical republicanism or civic humanism. This ideology is based on the Roman Republic and the city states of Ancient Greece and focuses on ideals such as civic virtue, rule of law, and mixed government.
This understanding of a republic as a distinct form of government from a liberal democracy is one of the main theses of the Cambridge School of historical analysis. This grew out of the work of J.G.A. Pocock who in 1975 argued that a series of scholars had expressed a consistent set of republican ideals. These writers included Machiavelli, Milton, Montesquieu, and the founders of the United States of America .
Pocock argued that this was an ideology with a history and principles distinct from liberalism. These ideas were embraced by a number of different writers Quentin Skinner, Philip Pettit and Cass Sunstein. These subsequent writers have further explored the history of the idea, and also outlined how a modern republic should function.
A distinct set of definitions for the word republic evolved in the United States. In common parlance a republic is a state that does not practice direct democracy but rather has a government indirectly controlled by the people. In the rest of the world this is known as representative democracy. This understanding of the term was originally developed by James Madison, and notably employed in Federalist Paper No. 10. This meaning was widely adopted early in the history of the United States, including in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828. It was a novel meaning to the term, representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics.
The term republic does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, but does appear in Article IV of the Constitution which "guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government." What exactly the writers of the constitution felt this should mean is uncertain. The Supreme Court , in Luther v. Borden (1849), declared that the definition of republic was a "political question" in which it would not intervene. In two later cases, it did establish a basic definition. In United States v. Cruikshank (1875), the court ruled that the "equal rights of citizens" were inherent to the idea of republic. The opinion of the court from In re Duncan (1891) held that the "right of the people to choose their government" is also part of the definition. Due to the 1875 and 1891 court decisions establishing basic definition, in the first version (1892) of the Pledge of Allegiance, which included the word republic, and like Article IV which refers to a Republican form of government, the basic definition of republic is implied and continues to do so in all subsequent versions, including the present edition, by virtue of its consistent inclusion.
Beyond these basic definitions the word republic has a number of other connotations. W. Paul Adams observes that republic is most often used in the United States as a synonym for state or government, but with more positive connotations than either of those terms. Republicanism is often referred to as the founding ideology of the United States. Traditionally scholars believed this American republicanism was a derivation of the liberal ideologies of John Locke and others developed in Europe.
The political philosophy of republicanism initiated by Machiavelli was thought to have had little impact on the founders of the United States. In the 1960s and 1970s a revisionist school lead by the likes of Bernard Bailyn began to argue that republicanism was just as or even more important than liberalism in the creation of the United States. This issue is still much disputed and scholars like Kramnick completely reject this view.
Oligarchies or aristocracies are not always indicated as republics, but for instance Montesquieu in his 1748 The Spirit of the Laws (e.g. book II, 1: "a republican government is that in which the body, or only a part of the people, is possessed of the supreme power"), does
Some states, although not being led by a monarch, and having a democratic constitution, choose not to term themselves "republic".
"A republic, by which I mean a government in which the scheme of representation takes place, opens a different prospect, and promises the cure for which we are seeking. Let us examine the points in which it varies from pure democracy ...", from James Madison. The Federalist, Number 10, The New York Packet, 23 Nov., 1787
The novelist and essayist H.G.Wells regularly used the term crowned republic to describe the United Kingdom, for instance in his work A Short History of the World. Alfred, Lord Tennyson in his poem Idylls of the King.

There is something about the smell of the water in Orlando that says we've arrived. A la; Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore. I am convinced I can smell it coming off the plane. I would imagine it's something to do with the amount of chlorine they add to it but I'm no water expert so we'll just leave it at, it smells different, nice different. Although, I have heard people wholeheartedly disagree on this.
Ever since the first two challenges over at Disney Scrappers were posted I have been itching to do a watery themed page. I don't have a while lot of watery photos from Disney. In fact, we've never been to any of the water parks - I know, call yourself a Disney-a-holic?!? It is impossible to see and do everything in one trip. What can I say.. we NEED to go back.
During our second trip in 2007 we managed to fit in a day at SeaWorld. OK, so it's not quite Disney but Orlando and Disney are interchangable in my mind - one means that other and vice versa. I don't just love Disney, I love Orlando, hell, I love Florida :)
Echo Park's Splash was perfect for some SeaWorld photos. I hand cut a waves, a clould and a sun and added some matching stickers. I used a very old (so old I can't remember who it's by) 'Paradise Found' rub-on and an even older SeaWorld logo die cut. Continuing to use old supplies I added two wooden embelishments that I bought in Michaels on our last trip on Orlando. I then sneezed, a big old flower sneeze. I added buttons, gems and pearls for flower centres and bubbles in the water. Thanks for stopping by. Kx
oh you have convinced me! I am totally getting that collection for Sea World photos. I haven't been in like 6 years but I never got it all scrapped. My photos aren't as pretty because the park in Texas isn't as tropical as the one in Orlando. Love your layout designs here and I may have to borrow a few ideas. LOVE it all!
Just found your blog from disneyscrappers, love it and those layouts are adorable, live in London now but originally from Glasgow, small world!
Awesome, Kristeen! What a gorgeous photo! Your colors really bring the feel of the Florida tropics to your layout! And your flowers, title work, and that great anchor rock!
I have stumbled on quite the discovery. A scientific development unlike any seen before! Or maybe just a plot for another romantic comedy. Quick, someone call Katherine Heigl.
A shift of power in her favor, of course. And not necessarily a concious one on her behalf. It is less about her gaining power, and more about me losing power. And pride, but that is another post.
When you are dating - the girl is constantly looking for that ring. If you are walking in the park and bend down to tie your shoe she gets tears in her eyes. Order champaigne for the two of you on a fancy date and she'll pour the whole glass on the floor looking for a ring like it is a box of Cracker Jacks (which is ridiculous - her ring isn't worth nearly as much as a box of Cracker Jacks).
And when you ARE engaged - you get to play tough guy about the wedding. She wants chair covers and a live band and a pack of unicorns? Too bad, honey - I say two unicorns, MAX!
But after the wedding - she has already gotten everything she wanted. There is no ring, no wedding - just a shell of a man who is folding laundry while watching The Walking Dead. It is like I've become an antique - I swear I saw her trying to sell me on eBay the other day.
So I've got an idea. Not to get all Obama on you, but we gotta spend our way outta this mess. I think men should institute a re-engagement ring.
Think about it - sure it is going to cost a pretty penny - but it leaves her on pins and needles for the entire marriage!!! It is like when you were 9 and suddenly became the most well-behaved kid on earf as soon as November hit because you wanted to fool Santa. And apparently putting roofies in the milk you left out so you could get ALL the toys in his sled is frowned upon (sorry, Mom.)
And if the re-engagement ring doesn't work? We can always fall back on the roofies. Hey, it worked on Santa.
Congrats on tying the knot...and sorry about that loss of power. But I think you could get all of woman-kind on your side with this re-engagement ring idea. Seriously...the ladies loooove jewelry.
Dude. Glad you're back. I totally dig that Walking Dead show. I love watching it On Demand the day after, so I can fast forward past any part that might catch me off guard watching it at regular speed.
There's the eternity ring (diamonds all around implying never ending love), the three stone anniversary ring (for past, present and future), and on and on. And, really, why stop at rings? Earrings, pendants, bracelets... there's so much for you to spend your money on. Of course, it won't reinstate any power but it'll make you look less jerky to the in-laws.
Well, let's see life was good until just over two years ago. My wife had surgery for breast cancer. She's still living but life is hell! Intimacy hasn't happened since then. She or I just can't seem to make thing work as they used to. She gets pissed for no reason. Menopause has kicked in. Transferred to a store that is on the wrong side of town so work is he"". The pressure keeps coming at work and to top it all off our insurance isn't paying for all of the things it used to so Money just isn't there. Haven't gotten a raise in 4 years. I just want out!!!

I was lucky enough to get to Abilene, Kansas this week to catch up with Chris on his third rest day. It was good to see my fella. He looks good and feels good. Yes, he’s pretty tired but his spirits are good. There is no ‘give up’ in my Hubster, none! As I said goodbye to him yesterday morning and watched him cycle off for what was a 104 mile ride day with nearly 5000 ft of climbing, I remembered back to his first 9 mile ride only ten months ago, during which he had to take a break mid-ride to rest! When he signed up to do the ride, he was not a cyclist. However, what he initially lacked in cycling skills and miles in the saddle, he made up for with a huge commitment to train, and great coaching and guidance from the very talented and enthusiastic Julie McKenzie! Yesterday marked the half way point in his big adventure. Since setting out from Manhattan Beach, CA on May 13th Chris has cycled over 1700 miles, passing through California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri. Each day he doesn’t think beyond the ride ahead, and that is probably a good thing, as he still has a long, long way to ride!
For him, the ride has become much, much bigger than a bucket list item. He is riding to be reminded that he still controls his life and most importantly what we chooses to do with his life post his WM diagnosis. He is riding to be reminded that he still has a lot of living ahead of him, regardless of the impact of WM on his life now and in the future. He is riding to be reminded that he will not be defined or constrained by WM, despite the fact that it will try to do both to him! He is riding to be reminded that there is really nothing he cannot do (I already knew that anyway)! Most importantly, he is riding to raise much needed dollars for research into better treatment options and an eventual cure for WM. As a rare/orphan disease, WM receives very little funding because of the small numbers of people who are diagnosed (three in a million). The fantastic news is that at the half way point on the coast to coast ride you have helped Chris raise over $20,000 for research at Mayo Clinic. What is even more astounding is that the $20,000 has come from only 39 donors. All of the money donated on behalf of Chris will be directed to fund a specific research project at Mayo Clinic that is focused on the development of a WM patient-specific vaccine for long-term cure. We picked this particular project after discussions with Chris’s haematologist at Mayo, Dr. Sikander Ailawadhi, given that vaccine technology holds remarkable potential. If you haven’t already donated, you can access the Mayo Clinic giving site via Chris’s blog by clicking on the ‘Donate’ button. No donation is too small (or too large), so please donate whatever you can and spread the word to your friends, family and business colleagues. Every penny we raise together can and will make a difference. I am reminded of something Seamus Heaney once wrote – “Believe that a farther shore is reachable from here. Believe in miracles and cures and healing wells.” He wasn’t writing about a coast to coast cycle ride, nor was he writing about someone living with an incurable cancer. He was writing about hope, which is something we all could use a little bit of in our lives.
A simple thank you really doesn’t adequately capture the extent of Chris’s (and my) gratitude for the support, both in terms of the huge amount of money donated so far but also the many lovely emails and messages that you’ve sent from all across the globe! The generous donations and the very kind words of support and love have motivated Chris each and every single day to get up at 5:30 am, get back on Irma (his bike, in case you haven’t been reading the blog since the early months) and pedal (and sometimes endure) another 70-100 mile ride to the next town. At the start of the ride, he was determined to ride EFI (every foot and inch), and at the half way mark, this remains his goal. Boston is only another 1700 miles away!

The # 2 Aston-Martin DBR1/300 (S/N 2, would win this race) of Carroll Shelby & Jack Fairman, followed by
Last but not least the # 10 Ferrari 250 TR 59 (S/N 0766TR, would finish 3rd) of Olivier Gendebien (other sources say that Cliff Allison drove the car until it was taken over by Phil Hill / Tony Brooks).
In the photo, we see the car being rolled off the lorry with a fantastic backdrop composed of early 1960's French cars and some sponsor vehicles like Dunlop and the Citroen HY of Bardahl Oil.
The car, which bears race number 6 here is S/N 0808 (previously 0780TR, a 250 TR 60, which frame was lengthened, a Fantuzzi body was mounted and equipped with a 4 Liter 390 HP V12 engine) and which seems to reside in Argentina now.
In the photo, we see Olivier getting a hand to climb over the pit wall after his stint. Taking all aspects into account (like the shadows, the dirt on the car etc) this photo was taken around 11 o'clock in the morning of June 24, 1962 (how lovely it is to discover such details on a COLOR photo!).
In the photo, we see the VERY start of the race where Phil Hill makes an athletic jump into the car so it was taken at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of June 23, 1962.
This is a vintage 1962 photo of the Scuderia Serenissima Ferrari 250 TRI 61 which was driven by Carlo Abate and Nino Vaccarella during the Nurburgring 1000 KM race.
The car in question is the 246 SP S/N 0796 which was later modified to serve as a mule for the Tipo 250 P and crashed during practice for the 1963 Targa Florio. The car burnt out completely and was assumed to have been scrapped although parts of it seem to survive.
In the background we see the # 108 Porsche 718 GTR of Nino Vaccarella and Jo Bonnier which would finish 3rd overall.
The photo measures some 5.5 x 3.5 inches or 13.5 x 9 cm and is in excellent condition. The back carries NO photographer' stamp.
This is a vintage photograph of the Ferrari 250P (# 22) of Mike Parkes and Umberto Maglioli during the April 6 and 7 1963 tests / qualification for the 24 Hours of Le Mans.
This is a so-called "wire photo" which was sent around the world by Interpress from Paris, France in April 1963 and comes complete with a brief description as shown in the scan.
This is a vintage 1964 photo of the 196SP, S/N 0790, during the training day for the 1964 Targa Florio. Terra would partne up with Cesare Toppetti but unfortunately, the pair only managed 5 laps and dropped out of the race.
The car, S/N 0790, was bought by Terra in January 1964 and after a mere 4 races the car was stored until 2002. It now seems to reside in Germany.
The photo measures some 6 x 4 inches or 15 x 10 cm and is in excellent condition. The back carries NO photographer's stamp.

Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said he needed to lose a few pounds before he'd be ready for Burning Man. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call file photo)
Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid does not plan to attend the Burning Man annual gathering, which kicks off Sunday in the Black Rock Desert in his home state of Nevada.
The Democratic senator was actually asked about possibly visiting the event during a wide-ranging interview with the Reno Gazette-Journal which was posted online late Tuesday.
Link Logger can use Yahoo to send alert emails. Of course you need a Yahoo email account and configure Link Logger as shown during our testing. Note the use of port 587.
I am often asked if Link Logger supports the Linksys WRV200G which always poses a dilemma for me as currently Link Logger doesn't support the WRV200G. The reason is the WRV200G doesn't have complete logging, as it only logs outbound traffic and not inbound traffic (if a port is forwarded it logs it). So for example scans against your WAN IP are not logged by the WRV200G.
Now the sad reality is the WRV200G has more complete logging then just about any other newer Linksys product. Fortunately you can run DD-WRT, Tomato etc with a number of Linksys products (but not currently the WRV200G) and they support syslog and Link Logger, but otherwise for the most part Linksys has drop traffic logging in their newer products.
Today was a good day as Amazon delivered my Blade Runner (Five-Disc Ultimate Collector's Edition) [HD DVD] (2007) today as a late Christmas present. Blade Runner is my all time favorite movie and to be able to see the original North American release (yes I like the narration as it gives it an old Bogart feel) in HD using my Xbox 360 Elite and the HD player was simply WOW!! I own the VHS original, the DVD director's cut, but when I saw this, I had to get it as I've been waiting a long time for a DVD version of the original film and to get it now in HD is exactly what I would have asked for. I'll be watching it again tomorrow night, the only question is what version but I'm thinking the Workprint version, and then the next night the International version and so on. This is going to be a great week of movie watching.
If your a Blade Runner fan like me then perhaps next time your in Seattle you should check out the original Flying Spinner and other movie props at Experience Music Project / Science Fiction Museum and Hall of Fame in Seattle. Experience music is simply amazing, but I was hugely surprised at how good the Science Fiction Museum was. Toss in the Museum of Flight and the Seattle Underground and Seattle becomes a very cool place to visit. So I will be going mid April for the MVP Summit Conference at Microsoft, but I'll be visiting some of my favorite museums again as well.
On November 20th I did my first webcast as part of the Microsoft Ignite Your Code Webcast series (ya I know that is a suckie picture of me, just there are not many photos of me in existence) . I did the presentation on Windows Security Essentials . You can download my demo code from here
The webcast includes an introduction into how Windows implements security and then how to include security into your code. I hope you enjoy and learn something helpful.

Build an infinite lava/water source if lava/water is scarce near you. Infinite lava is harder to make, as you need four lava source blocks to make infinite lava, but only two water source blocks to make infinite water.
I thought that once the fabric arrived I would be inspired, but I found the combination odd, stymieing me further.

Society has experienced years with men walking around clean shaven. But, times are changing and the beard has come back in style. The 1970’s is an excellent reference when it comes to beards. There are more than 30 beard styles to choose from. The most common beard styles are full beard, stubble, goatee, anchor, bandholz and ducktail. Since beards are here to stay, it’s time to learn how to take proper care of them. The following 9 ways to care for your beard will help you look your best.
Comb your beard with a wide-tooth comb to help remove tangles. This process also helps remove debris such as food particles and sticky substances such as coffee and other liquids from your beard. You will be surprised how often your beard will collect crumbs and other substances. If you have a thick beard you should also follow up by using a brush to assure you remove all particles. Keeping your beard combed will help prevent embarrassing moments when in public.
Your beard consists of strong coarse hair that needs to be specifically treated. Your regular shampoo is not going to help your beard too much. Also, standard shampoos often contain ingredients that dry your skin. Since the beard industry is booming, manufacturers are creating new and improved products that help men care for their beards properly. Shampoo’s that are specifically made for beards also treat your skin. Men that use standard shampoo are often surprised when their skin gets dried out and flakes begin to appear. These skin flakes show up in your beard and resemble dandruff. You can prevent this from happening by choosing a shampoo specifically made for beards.
It’s not a secret that oil helps hair stay moisturized and looking it’s best. The true secret is finding the right oil for specific hair types. Since beards have course thick hair, a special oil formula specifically created for beards will be your best option. Beard oil also helps improve the condition of your skin by keeping it moisturized and healthy. Pacino's beard oil is made with tea tree oil which provides a multitude of benefits. Tea tree oil is known for its antibiotic properties that will help prevent skin infections, which is a common issue for some men that have beards. Pacinos beard oil is also an incredible hair softener that will keep your beard looking polished, shiny and healthy.
As mentioned earlier some men experience skin infections under their beards. This happens when the skin is not taken care of properly or has a lack of exposure to fresh air due to being covered by strong, thick, black hair. Caring for your skin is important, but not complicated. A simple solution is using a beard and face scrub.
There are more than 30 types of beard styles to choose from and it’s up to you to decide the best option. Once you choose a beard style, make sure you keep it in shape with regular trimming. Whether you choose a long or short style, always pay close attention to the mouth area. Trimming stray hairs so your lips are visible is recommended.
Some men allow their beard to grow out for months or years without shaving any area of their face. While this is a freeing experience, shaving and sculpting your beard might come in handy to preserve the style you are wearing. Shaving specific sections to create a design or sculpt a beard to perfection is something almost every beard wearer experiences. Some men prefer to allow a professional to do the work, while others won’t let anyone touch their beard. If you are the ruler over your beard, you need shave properly. A cooling shaving gel is very useful during this process.
The neckline is a common area that is ignored by men that have beards. The neckline needs to be cared for as frequently as the face. Using a beard and face scrub will help keep your skin in good condition. Shaving the neckline regularly is recommended along with using a shaving gel.
As time goes forward and your beard grows into the style you desire, you will notice stray hairs will pop up along the way. Use a trim razor for accuracy. A trim razor often becomes a favorite tool that helps keep beards under control and looking great.
Combing, shampooing, conditioning, applying oil and trimming stray hairs helps to maintain your beard. However, if you ignore your beard or skip days, it can quickly grow into a disaster. Set a regular schedule to take care of your beard properly and give it the attention it needs. The frequency depends on the style and looks you desire.
Remember there are more than 30 different beard styles to choose from. You don’t have to settle on just one look. Keep your style fresh and new by trying a new beard style each season. Now that you know the best way to care for your beard, it’s time to take action. Pacinos offers a full line of men's hair grooming products that will keep your beard in excellent condition.

That’s what I’m thinking as I am interrupted mid-forkful of beef by a shout of “tail” from a steward. We’ve heard it for days, but we respond with enthusiasm. Simultaneously, each of the 31 guests onboard the Safari Explorer push back our chairs, grab our binoculars and head up to the bow. Beth, our exhibition leader, has spotted a pod of humpback whales engaged in “bubble net feeding.” The whales dive deep under a school of herring, form a circle and simultaneously blow their breath out, creating a “net.” Their haunting calls frighten the herring. The herding forces the herring to the surface, where the humpbacks surge to the surface, their huge, gaping mouths capturing their prey. Beth says this is a rare occurrence; that you could come to Alaska for years and never see this sight. We are lucky.
“Whales rock,” she says. So do sea lions, bald eagles, brown bear, Dall’s porpoises, Sitka black-tailed deer, seals, otters and puffins, all of which we see during our seven-night American Safari cruise in Alaska’s Inner Passage.
The journey begins and ends in Juneau, an unassuming former gold mining, city of just 30,000 people, but it has a cool vibe. A town, it has one great shoe store, several galleries and lots of saloons. You can tour the charming Alaska State Museum with tribal artifacts and the capitol, a former territorial building. Fortuitously, my visit coincides with the annual Celebration. More than 2,000 dancers from Tlinglit and Chilkat tribes in Alaska, Canada and. Washington perform at several indoor and outdoor venues wearing spectacular ermine-trimmed and button-festooned robes, beaded dresses and clan hats.
Before boarding the yacht, we take a bus to Mendenhall Glacier, one of 38 glaciers that flow from the Juneau Icefield. The area is part of the Tongass National Forest (below), the largest in North America, with old-growth Sitka spruce and western hemlocks. Peering through a telescope in the Visitor Center, I can see mountain goats scrambling up the mountains adjacent to the glacier; beavers are in evidence at the creek. Mendenhall Lake has a milky color because of the ground up rock, called glacier silt, it contains.
The excitement is palpable as we greet the awaiting crew of the 145-foot Safari Explorer, which holds just 36. According to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service, wildlife viewing is up in popularity in by 22% over the past five years. Because of its size, we can ply waters larger vessels cannot. The advantages are myriad: we can get up close and personal with wildlife, we can reach little-seen villages, there are no waits for shore excursions, we are flexible as we chart our course and we have less impact on the environment.
My stateroom is casually elegant with a bathroom with heated floors, an iPod docking station, and a flat screen TV. There are no room keys. The guest/crew ratio is 2:1. The combination living room, library, bar and dining area boasts a large screen TV (for slide shows and lectures), leather couches and chairs, board games, DVDs and books. Almost immediately, guests kick off their shoes, some snuggling under throws, and chat, read or nap.
Camaraderie is a big part of the shared small-ship experience. Many of us will exchange email addresses. We are from different parts of the globe, we have different occupations, we have different life experiences and we are of different ages, yet we intermingle with ease.
Gourmet cuisine is another big part of the voyage, and Chef Phil and his staff of two turn out regionally inspired, two-course breakfasts and lunches and three-course dinners. We also enjoy fresh-baked cookies every afternoon and pre-dinner hors d’ouevres like salmon sashimi, potstickers or house-smoked cheddar. Ninety-five percent of the food is prepared from scratch.
Breakfast might include a spinach and feta quiche with Dungeness crab or apple oat pancakes with ham steak and red eye gravy. My favorite lunch was our only buffet: a BBQ sampler with pork ribs and grilled marbled King salmon, coleslaw with carrots, cabbage and apples, home-style potato salad and mini pecan tarts. Dinners featured tomato bisque, sockeye salmon with zucchini and summer squash, Alaskan King crab legs, smoked black cod with pesto risotto, rib eye with Stilton crumbles and cheesecake with raspberry puree.
At 6 a.m., we stop to pick a U.S. National Service park ranger who will be pointing out wildlife and answering questions while we are in Glacier Bay. The water is glassy, calm, a Caribbean aqua. The park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage site, is ever-changing, the result glacial movement. It feels as though we have it to ourselves—there’s not another boat in sight.
Alaska is two and half times the size of Texas, with more designated wilderness area than any other state. Much of the land is remote, with few roads; there are more licensed pilots in the state than all other states combined. From the ship, the unsullied and breathtaking grandeur of the place reveals itself. The weather plays hide and seek as we traverse the fjord (left) where the water plunges to 600 feet. Then it clears. The water sparkles; the sun warms enough to remove a layer of clothing. It’s a pristine early summer day, ideal for wildlife-watching.
First, we spot magnificent bald eagles diving for fish and resting on icebergs. Then come the humpback whales, the largest mammals in the world (some females are 50 feet or longer), distinguished by their enormous fluke (tail fin) breaking the surface. Next are the coastal brown bears, a mother and cub at the shoreline. The female rears up on her hind legs as another adult clambers down from the mountain. There are also cawing gulls and puffins, perched on rock outcroppings, and harbor seals, slithering off rocks into the water. It’s a lifetime’s worth of animal spotting, all before lunch.
There are glaciers in Southeast Alaska the size of Rhode Island. At Grand Pacific and Margerie Glaciers, we hope to see dramatic “calving” as large chunks break off and crash into the water. Just 200 years ago, this entire region was completely covered by ice. Glacial ice is a special clear, brilliant shade called storis blue. The ice appears blue because it absorbs all colors of the visible light spectrum except blue, which it transmits. As we drop anchor, we watch and listen to the stresses and strains of melting ice, water dripping, air bubbles popping and cracking. “Ice crispies,” Beth calls it.
We hear the calving before we see it: it sounds like a giant thunder clap. Eyes riveted to the glacier in front of us, we wait. A few minutes later, a huge block breaks off and hurtles into the water—just like on TV. I have goose bumps and not because I’m cold.
Later, we hike with Richard, our other onboard naturalist, who points out the old man’s beard that hangs on the hemlocks in the forest. It looks like Spanish moss and is an indicator of good air quality and a lack of pollution. When I return to my cabin, the bed’s been turned down with chocolates. Sweet dreams indeed.
Merlinda, wellness instructor, has been offering yoga and stretching every morning at 7 a.m. But I’m not an early riser. Instead, I sign up for my complementary 45-minute massage. There’s also a sauna and two step machines on deck. Just a few steps away is the bridge. Open to guests 24/7, it could probably accommodate all 31 of us at the same time. Scott is passing the wheel after this trip and Shawnda will pilot the ship for the balance of the season.
We’ve entered the richest whale waters in Southeast Alaska. We don orange life vests, put our cameras in the waterproof bags provided and climb into an inflatable skiff to get nearer to these gentle giants. Humpbacks are endangered, but this is their summer playground. It is thrilling when Beth spots telltale plume spray: there’s a pod of five, including a mother and calf. She cuts the engine and we watch, riveted, as a light rain begins to fall. The humpbacks are aerobic, acrobatic whales, diving, breaching and slapping their massive flukes on the surface of the water. At one point they come within 15 feet of the skiff, their huge knobby heads just above the water. We can feel the sea spray. Then comes the money shot, when the Y-shaped fluke crests the water. After 20 photographs, I finally snap proof. Sea lions cavort just in front of the skiff. We might be a little wet and a bit chilly, but we are energized.
Tonight, we celebrate the birthday of an 85-year old female passenger with a candle-lit cake. She’s given a tiara to wear, but I suspect she’d rather have a kayak paddle.
Thousands of sea lions on Brother’s Island jostle for space on the rocks, bellowing their discontentment when a patch of sunny stone is compromised. Talk about high-density living.
This morning’s excursion is kayaking in Kelp Bay where Sea lions bob their heads up, playing a game of hide and seek. They follow us, ducking below the surface as we attempt to steal a glance or take a picture. When we round the rocks too close to them, they waddle and slip with a splash into the water.
In the afternoon, we pull into Baranoff Harbor to hike to the hot springs. The sulfuric smell fills the air as we disrobe to our bathing suits. The springs are located in a shallow rock pool directly over rushing falls; the rocks are slimy with moss but the water feels silky and warm. One of the group brandishes a bottle of champagne from his backpack and pours each of the (all-female) “Baranoff Babes” a plastic cup of bubbly.
We hike further into the woods, coming upon skunk cabbage. It’s well named—the odoriferous plant fills our nostrils before we see the bright yellow flowers and waxy leaves. Richard tells us Indians used to wrap fish in them. The ground underfoot is mossy, springy and spongy; the forest looks almost fairylike. One passenger spontaneously hugs a giant tree.
We’ve pulled into Petersburg, a Norwegian fishing village (below). It’s the quintessential Alaska fishing town—think Northern Exposure. The hardware store sells groceries. There’s also a great bookstore where several of us replenish our reading material. The townspeople are friendly and stop their trucks to let us (jay)walk across the street.
A small group of us bike around town. We spy two Sitka-black tail deer on the front lawn of a house. They are not spooked by us at all. The owner is backing out of his driveway. He rolls down his window when he sees we have stopped to admire them. “They’re a nuisance,” he shouts with a smile. “You can have ‘em. I can’t keep them out of my yard.”
After dinner, we get another show as Dall’s porpoises appear below the bow. With their unique black and white coloration and thick-in-the-middle bodies they look like miniatures Orcas. We lean over the rail to get a closer look; at one point I count ten of them. I try to react quickly enough to catch them on camera, but their rapid-fire swimming, jumping and zipping from side to side shows up as a splash and bubbles on all my shots. Photo by Mike Colvin
We are hugging the steep fjord walls of Endicott Arm and Ford’s Terror. The name comes from a naval crew member who rowed a dinghy into the narrow entrance at slack tide in 1889. As the tide began to rise, Ford was trapped in the turbulent current of the granite-chiseled canyon for six terrifying hours.
We’ve dropped anchor. The weather, mostly warm and sunny all week, has turned rainy, chilly and a bit melancholic but it’s hardly terrifying. Still, Beth, our onboard exhibition leader, gives us a serious safety briefing before we launch our kayaks. “Watch out for icebergs—and not just the big ones. Even the bitty bergs can capsize your kayak. You can’t see what’s underneath.” Dawes Glacier is both spectacular and surreal; I feel as if I am floating in a giant cocktail.
Some chunks of ice are the size of cars; others the size of ice cubes. The water is gin-clear, aquamarine, smooth as glass. It’s quiet, so quiet that the only sounds I hear are the paddle slapping water, a seal crying out and ice creaking, cracking and shifting. I begin clicking off pictures, trying to capture this moment.
We begin to paddle, heading toward the wall of ice that glistens a couple of miles ahead of us. It takes us a few moments to gain a rhythm, to get our paddling in sync, and we have to make split-second decisions about the potential hazard of the icebergs—big and small—in our path. I shout out the simplest, most succinct directions: “Iceberg right, steer left.” “Big iceberg ahead. Bear right, then straight.”
We paddle toward a huge iceberg that glints like blue topaz. A harbor seal pop its head above the surface. We paddle toward a mother and pup on an ice floe, getting within a paddle length before they slip into the water. We paddle toward the rocky shoreline, then back toward the glacier. We take turns coasting, putting the paddles across our laps and taking photographs. Or just listening intently for the tell-tale boom of calving.
Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the sun comes out. Misty clouds lift from the mountains. The icebergs begin to melt like a huge slushy. There are fewer, less imposing obstructions and we navigate with greater ease. Fewer words are exchanged. We have gained some mastery and more than a little faith in our abilities in the past hour.
All too soon, Beth is signaling for us to return to the ship. Bradley and I are the last of the passengers to paddle in; we jokingly contemplate making a break for it, forcing the boat to chase us through the fjord, thinking we are nimble enough to elude the captain.
Back onboard, Elaine, the bartender, uses an ice pick to break up a CPU-sized block of glacier ice and proposes a martini.
At the farewell dinner, champagne is poured and Captain Scott speaks of friendships that are formed during oceanic voyages. Beth shows a photographic slideshow of the weeks’ activities to raucous good cheer (we will receive a copy during breakfast before we disembark the next morning). Even though we have to be in port at Juneau early the next morning, no one wants to end the night, so Elaine obliges us into the wee hours.
The Safari Explorer’s season in Alaska runs from May to September. For information and reservations, log onto www.amsafari.com.
for many, many years my family's Christmas outing was to go to Rockefeller Center to have lunch at the Sea Grill, skate on the ice rink, and take in the great lighted fir tree. But while the skating and the tree still hold their wonder, I haven't been back to the Sea Grill since chef Edward Brown, who had been there 17 years, left a year or so years ago. Fortunately he has reappeared, now on his own, at Eighty One, a splendid new Upper West Side restaurant near the Museum of Natural History.
Brown's impressive résumé, before the Sea Grill, includes stints at the Maurice under Alain Senderens and Christian DeLouvrier, and before that at Lucas Carton in Paris. His own book, The Modern Seafood Cook (1995), is still one of the best on the subject. So I was all prepared to see what Brown could do with non-piscine fare too.
Eighty One is a deep, broad restaurant with high-backed booths, deep red lipstick colors, and polished wood floors. The tables are well set with the finest napery, stemware, and silverware, the winelist is very strong on every count, and service is amiable throughout the evening, well attiuned to the pacing of the kitchen. Over two visits the decibel level in the full room never rose above the conversational level. This is a fine restaurant for people who want to dine, not be part of a scene.
Brown's modern American cuisine shows the deft way he used to focus on fish species to bring out their best, now with meat, fowl, and vegetables. He combines foie gras and chicken in a terrine (left), light and mild, with baby arugula, celeriac, apples, and truffles. Wonderful New Bedford sea scallops and foie gras ravioli in a chervil-based wine sauce makes for a refined starter. One evening gnocchi parisienne were much too soft and starchy, but a summer's fava bean and pea soup with fromage blanc, a hint of garlic, and crab croquette showed marvelous delicacy and flavor. Crispy softshell crabs were fat, sweet, and indeed crispy.
he cooks fluke on the Spanish griddle, giving it a gentle sear, then combines it with summer's vegetables in a fresh lemon-thyme broth. His succulent roast squab comes with peppery purslane, walnuts for texture, and caramelized daikon for sweetness. And Colorado lamb comes two ways, with roasted baby zucchini and the lovely creamy touch of ricotta. You can taste in every dish the finesse and respect he has for the principal ingredients, because they are always top of the season.
For dessert John Miele provides more complex, textured dishes; his bittersweet chocolate-hazelnut mille-feuille with Mandarin hot fudge and a white chocolate crèmeux will give you the general idea; there's also a fine Meyer lemon frozen soufflé with lemongrass pannacotta, pistachio, and a blood orange sorbet.
Brown (right) has said he wants elegance with comfort at 81, and that is what you get. It's not at all stuffy, but the propriety of good service and sophisticated cooking makes this (still) a rarity on the West Side, where restaurants get better all the time--just not with this much refinement.
While Chilean red wines like Concha y Toro’s Almaviva, Casa Lapostolle’s Apalta, and Montes Alpha “M” have achieved real status among the wine media and the enviable sales to go along with them, Chile’s white wines have not, as yet, fared quite so luminously.
Of course, white wines have a lot of catching up to do in Chile, where the Spanish brought red wine grapes, mainly Pais, during the colonial period. Indeed, red European varietals like cabernet sauvignon and carmenere were only really planted there as of there 1980s, and, only in the last decade, has modern technology allowed vintners to boost white wine quality.
Overall, Chile’s wine industry is booming: in 2007, Chile was the fourth in bottled wine market share, with 8% of the imported bottled wine market in the US, according to the Gomberg-Fredrikson Report. Imports of Chilean wine increased by 13% in 2007 and increased in value by 24%, up to $207 million. Currently, Chile is the only one of the top ten wine- producing countries in the world showing an overall increase—2 percent--in wines being imported to the US. Of that amount, white wines grew by 9 percent, making up 24 percent of the Chilean wine brought into the US. The most recent data, from the of 2006, shows that there are 28,468 hectares of white wine planted in Chile, which is a remarkable 24.4 percent of all vines planted.
The two main white Chilean varietals are sauvignon blanc (8,697 hectares) and chardonnay (8,548 hectares), with viognier beginning to make some gains. Shamefully, it was not until the 1990s that Chilean vintners admitted that a lot of what they said was sauvignon blanc was actually the unrelated, inferior sauvignonasse, also called sauvignon vert. Those days are, apparently, long gone.
Chile’s vineyard regions spread up and down the Pacific coast, whose winds cool the white grapevines in the morning and evening, from Casablanca in the north to Bio-Bio in the south. The soils seem to favor the kind of fruit ripeness these days preferred in white wines, especially sauvignon blanc, which I found the most desirable of the dozen examples of Chilean whites I tried.
I expected to find the wines refreshing and bright—all from recent vintages—as an aperitif, but because some reach a minimum of 13.5 percent alcohol, they go very well with food, which included a salad of avocado, chickpeas, and peppers. To my surprise, the chardonnays, with their mellow acids, went well with lasagna made with mozzarella, ricotta, and parmesan cheeses with tomato sauce, because the creaminess of the cheese is ideal with chardonnay, and the sweetness of the tomato (itself a fruit, not a vegetable) was enhanced by the wine.
By far the largest wine producer in Chile, with sales in excess of 6 million cases annually, Concha y Toro was founded in 1883. (It now has a 50-50 agreement with France’s Baron Philippe de Rothschild SA company to make Grand Cru class red wines like those from Château Mouton-Rothschild.) Concha y Toro’s Terrunyo Sauvignon Blanc Vineyard Selection (Block 28) 2006 ($22-$25; above) was a striking example of how far Chilean whites have come. The seductive tropical fruit is definitely there, but this is no fruit punch. Its balance of acid, flinty notes, and creamy smoothness on the finish make it uniquely Chilean, without the cloying sweetness of so many New Zealand sauvignon blancs or the acrid grassiness of lesser Sancerres.
Punto Niño Sauvignon Blanc 2007, from the Casablanca Valley, is a great buy at $15, a brisk and refreshing wine with which to enjoy tapas like shrimp, sardines, and cheeses, with a pretty floral bouquet and just enough fruit, minerals, and crisp acid to keep it on the dinner table.
Casa Marin Sauvignon Blanc Laurel 2007 ($22) also has a fine, passion flower nose, but it was far too fruity and a tad too sweet to enjoy with most foods aside from a nibble of country bread with an olive tapenade.
Of the chardonnays I tried, I was not much taken with Los Vascos 2007 ($9-$10) from Colchagua Valley. This winery also has a Rothschild connection—this time Lafite—and they make a pleasant Bordeaux-style red called Le Dix. But this chardonnay had almost no color whatsoever, little of the aroma of a white Burgundy, and none of the oak and caramel of a California example. It was simply a bland, ten-dollar white wine.
The Garces Silver family’s Amayna Chardonnay 2005 ($20) is a limited run of only 1.543 cases, and it shows the benefits of oak and age without crossing the line into muscularity. At 14 percent alcohol it’s a bold white wine, and I sensed that it is at its peak right now and probably won’t gain further maturity. Drink it right now with the last lobsters of summer.
~~~~~~~~~~From September 18-30 the trade organization Wines of Chile will partner with Gourmet Magazine to present the third annual "Salud! Chilean Wine Fest" in New York. Thirty restaurants and ten retail wine stores will be showcasing Chilean wines, some with complementary tastings.

“The road beckons, so we heed its call and peel out. The radio’s playing a song with a gravelly refrain that goes `Minnesota. . . we got pride, pride, pride!’ Motorcycle gangs, all bandannas and flapping leather fringe, thrum down the asphalt. A crust of butterflies forms on the front bumper. We slow down to let wild horses cross, and I wrestle splinters of beef jerky out of my molars.”--Nathalie Jordi, “Farm Fresh,” Condé Nast Traveler (August 2008).
The French Foreign Legion is producing a wine called "Esprit de Corps" to raise funds for its veterans. The 2007 Côtes de Provence red and rosé vintages are produced from grapes grown in southern France where its war-wounded and former fighters work in the vineyard. Lieutenant-Colonel Xavier Lantaires described them as “strong when attacked, solid on the onslaught, full of grapeshot on the front line."

NEW FEATURE: I am happy to report that the Virtual Gourmet is linking up with three excellent travel sites:
I consider this the best and savviest blog of its kind on the web. Potter is a columnist for USA Weekend, Diversion, Laptop and Luxury Spa Finder, a contributing editor for Ski and a frequent contributor to National Geographic Traveler, ForbesTraveler.com and Elle Decor. "I’ve designed this site is for people who take their travel seriously," says Potter. "For travelers who want to learn about special places but don’t necessarily want to pay through the nose for the privilege of staying there. Because at the end of the day, it’s not so much about five-star places as five-star experiences." To go to his blog click on the logo below: THIS WEEK: THIS WEEK: 6 EUROPEAN HOTEL CHAINS PROMISE CHEAP SLEEP.
Eating Las Vegas is the new on-line site for Virtual Gourmet contrinbutor John A. Curtas., who since 1995 has been commenting on the Las Vegas food scene and reviewing restaurants for Nevada Public Radio. He is also the restaurant critic for KLAS TV, Channel 8 in Las Vegas, and his past reviews can be accessed at KNPR.org. Click on the logo below to go directly to his site.
Tennis Resorts Online: A Critical Guide to the World's Best Tennis Resorts and Tennis Camps, published by ROGER COX, who has spent more than two decades writing about tennis travel, including a 17-year stretch for Tennis magazine. He has also written for Arthur Frommer's Budget Travel, New York Magazine, Travel & Leisure, Esquire, Money, USTA Magazine, Men's Journal, and The Robb Report. He has authored two books-The World's Best Tennis Vacations (Stephen Greene Press/Viking Penguin, 1990) and The Best Places to Stay in the Rockies (Houghton Mifflin, 1992 & 1994), and the Melbourne (Australia) chapter to the Wall Street Journal Business Guide to Cities of the Pacific Rim (Fodor's Travel Guides, 1991).

He is author of The Encyclopedia of American Food & Drink (Lebhar-Friedman), The Dictionary of Italian Food and Drink (Broadway), and, with his wife Galina, the award-winning Italian-American Cookbook (Harvard Common Press).
My newest book, written with my brother Robert Mariani, is a memoir of our years growing up in the North Bronx. It's called Almost Golden because it re-visits an idyllic place and time in our lives when so many wonderful things seemed possible.
For those of you who don't think of the Bronx as “idyllic,” this book will be a revelation. It’s about a place called the Country Club area, on the shores of Pelham Bay. It was a beautiful neighborhood filled with great friends and wonderful adventures that helped shape our lives. It's about a culture, still vibrant, and a place that is still almost the same as when we grew up there.
Robert and I think you'll enjoy this very personal look at our Bronx childhood. It is not yet available in bookstores, so to purchase a copy, go to amazon.com or click on Almost Golden.

A southern farmer got in his pickup and drove several miles to a neighboring farm and knocked on the farmhouse door. A young boy, about 12, opened the door. "Is yer pa home?" he asked.
"No, she ain't here either. She went to town with pa." "Well, then, how about yer brother, Joe, is he here?" "No sir, he went with pa and ma."
The farmer stood there for a few minutes, shifting from one foot to the other, and mumbling to himself.
"Is there anything I kin do fer ya'?" inquired the young boy politely. "I know where all the tools are, if you want to borry one; Or maybe I could take a message fer pa."
Well," said the farmer uncomfortably, "I really wanted to talk to yer pa. It's about your brother Joe getting my daughter, Pearly Mae, pregnant."
The boy considered for a moment. "You would have to talk to pa about that," he finally conceded. "I know that pa charges $500 for the bull and $250 for the boar hog, but I really don't know how much he gets for Joe."

If you have ever run a business you must be aware of how difficult marketing can be when you want to reach a wider market. Marketing your business manually is one of the most daunting and unreliable efforts one can employ. Advertising helps reach a wide market and easier. This necessitates the production of commercials to communicate your message through a number of channels. Advertising and commercials are almost the same though.
Advertising is a form of communication intended to persuade an audience (viewers, readers or listeners) to take some action. It includes the name of a product or service and how that product or service could benefit the consumer, to persuade potential customers to purchase or to consume that particular brand. Modern advertising developed with the rise of mass production in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries. Commercial advertisers often seek to generate increased consumption of their products or services through banding, which involves the repetition of an image or product name in an effort to associate related qualities with the brand in the minds of consumers.
In the current fragmented market, the marketers are facing tough competition from their competitors. Each marketer has to prove himself to be better than his competitors. The cut-throat competitive market environment has made the advertising field very experimental and hence advertisers are adopting different measures to attract the attention of their target customers. They try to present their advertisements in such a way that catches instant customer attention.
Being business entities, sometimes companies are carried away with their profit motives. They forget that as they are a part of the society, they have a responsibility towards the society, as well. Any activity of the company should not have an adverse effect on the society. The same stands true in respect of advertising also. With the growth in the reach and frequency of mass media, the advertising industry has also grown by leaps and bounds. It implies that the persons exposed to advertising are also growing with the growth of mass media and the advertising industry.
One of the major media platforms you can use to communicate your message is the television. This medium’s combination of audio and visual makes it standout. However, producing and running a television commercial is quite expensive, although one ought to ensure that they get the best for their company from the commercial.
To get the most out of your TV advertising, the best practice is to not only learning from others, but to carve out your own niche. So to answer your question, TV advertising can be expensive if you want it to be, or it can be as cheap as using your iPhone to take HD video and hiring a local guy like myself to compile the images and video together. The downside to the cheap way is that while the commercial will look good, the quality of the images won’t translate well during television broadcasts and are mainly suited for the Internet.
The production of a commercial is as complex as the ideas in your head for how you want your company to be perceived. For example, Empire Construction paid Comcast $1,000 in 2008 to produce a 30-second commercial. Comcast’s videographer came out for one hour, shot some generic ‘b-roll’ footage, and then edited it all together. Empire Construction wasn’t happy. They paid so much for the commercial that they felt they had to show it in order to get their monies worth. My company came in, helped Empire Construction create a more compelling commercial for $500 – one that the company owner helped make – and this commercial continues to be shown. Better yet, the company agreed to make a second commercial with us.
Granted, Empire Construction still has to pay for the airtime to show the commercial, but self-producing allowed the company the freedom to stream the commercial on its website, on YouTube, and any other social media outlet.

As much as commercials are important to any business, these costly ventures are a great challenge to small businesses without much financial support. This, among a number of other influential factors makes the small business owners opt not to strain their limited finances in funding commercials. However, the coverage of these businesses is not as wide thus they enjoy the close proximity of their customers, which outweighs the necessity for commercials.
Small businesses have significantly lower budgets than large corporations, so they allocate less money to advertising activities, which limits their visibility. While large corporations opt for glossy advertisements in national publications to reach their market, small business owners place advertisements in local publications.
Small businesses can take advantage of local marketing by making direct connections with the community and its members. From participating in local business associations to sponsoring local events, they have the ability to personally introduce their businesses to market they service. Arrange speaking engagements in your business community to generate potential leads for your business.
With less staff than a larger business, small business owners have a limited amount of staff with the skills and abilities necessary to market their companies. As a result, they are unable to execute large-scale events and promotions without overworking their staff and exhausting their resources.
Metro Midwives is a home birth midwifery practice designed to offer healthy women a holistic, family centered alternative to medical-based obstetrical services. We offer comprehensive care which includes complete prenatal care, labor, birth, and postpartum care for mother and baby all in the comfort of your own home.
Today's families want more than technological care during pregnancy and birth. And studies show that low-risk women can safely give birth in their own home with the help of a skilled midwife. We spend a considerable amount of time at each pre-natal visit, getting to know you, the whole person. The families we care for are encouraged to take an active part in prenatal care and birth. Our support, encouragement and education during this time provide women with the environment in which to listen to their bodies, and enables them the empowerment to give birth naturally. It is our belief that every woman has the right to give birth in a nurturing environment where she can actively participate in her care and the birth of her baby. To borrow a statement from the World Health Organization... "Birth is not an Illness"!
It is our firm belief that education and support will enable women to make the best possible choices for themselves, and result in the most beautiful, transforming experiences for their families.
I have attended homebirth as a primary midwife since 1997. I received my academic and clinical training at a nationally renowned birth center in Dearborn Michigan where I had the opportunity to attend about 200 births before starting my own midwifery practice. This experience prepared me for the NARM exam which I successfully passed both the written and skills portion. In 1998 I opened a free standing birth center in Taylor, which I directed and operated for nearly 13 years. During that time I had the opportunity and pleasure to assist in the births of nearly 700 families, either at the birth center or in their homes. Nearly 70% of the women I serve choose to give birth in water. Almost all women use water for relaxation at some point in labor.
I have 4 children. My first daughter was born by C-section in 1988. I have since had 3 VBAC'S. My oldest son was born with midwives in a birth center in 1993. I also have a son who was born in 2004 and a daughter born in 2006. Both were amazing home waterbirths.
I work with a couple of different students that share my views and philosophies about pregnancy, birth and breastfeeding. They are an integral part of the care that I provide. I choose one student based on geographical location to assist myself and your family during the course of prenatal care, labor and birth, and the postpartum period.

Be amazed as I tell you how we turned one ordinary unassuming cowboy hat into not one...but TWO totally new hat creations just like magic! Yes, you read that right. We created this porkpie hat for Mr. Sam...
...out of one used cowboy hat! Well, okay, it might not be too terribly "amazing" or "like magic" in any way. But, it is definitely thrifty, right?! :)
Not so recently we acquired another cowboy hat (this one is from my dad who heard us yammering about our interest in reshaping felt hats). Right away Mr. Sam had started making it into a short top hat style like the previous brown one, but he didn't like how it was turning out due to the red vent holes on the sides and gave up. After it sat for awhile in our craft shelf, I finally pulled it down, reshaping and shortening it even more on top to the porkpie style we've come to know and love.
This one is much shallower than the brown one because of the deeper fold. When he put it on I kinda thought he reminded me slightly of when Johnny Depp wore a porkpie in "Benny and Joone", except that this one is black and the brim is shaped slightly different.
After finishing it, I don't think the red rivets look so bad. Though, I think it would be nice with an extra wide hadband with red in it. You think? I'm contemplating making a band out of seed beads. Perhaps a snake pattern or something.
Then out of the blue, I managed to pull a second hat out of the first. Or, should that be off of it? All I know is there's one thing we keep accumulating from all these felt hats. (I think 8 now actually, not including our gazillion tabistry and leather hats!) It's lots of scrap felt from the excess brims. Cowboy hats tend to have really wide brims. And, we keep cutting them down to about 1 1/2-2 1/2 inches, leaving me with a pile of felt rings. And, you probably know by now that I can't throw anything away. :) So, the other day as I was straightening up the craft room, I was inspired by the coiling of the scrap felt as I put it up. It looked like it would make a unique little cocktail hat for a rockabilly-ish night out.
I made a kind of tapered slanted pill box by wrapping the felt around in a more deliberate coil. The top was then covered with a piece of scrap felt. I embellished the front with a big black removable pin. This way I can be indecisive and change it to match my outfit. Like the red paper hat I posted about, I used a piece of netting (probably from produce or something), this time in black, to make a short veil. Later, I went back and added the black lace trim. (Forgive me for "photoshopping" the top of the hat in this pic. I actually didn't put on the lace trim until a few days after the event.)
For this last mintue event, I just pinned the hat on my head using hairpins. There is a ridge created just under the outer ring by the overlapping coiled strip that I secured the pins so that they weren't visible. But, eventually I will sew in a clip/comb or two to keep it in place. I have to say, the hairpins kept it in on my head pretty well considering how wild we can sometime dance! :)
We had a really good time. Watched some talented performers and, best of all, listened/danced to some great live music. Need to do it again soon!
In other news, I've got a mile long list of crafting to get back to on top of tutorials to write. And, Halloween is approachng very sneakily. So, if you don't hear from me for awhile, don't panic. :) I hope to have some spectacular stuff to show when I come up for air. Until then, be craftastic!!
Wow! That really is amazing how you came up with those to awesome hats out of that cowboy hat! Too clever!!
Nice hat. You look elegant on it. That cowboy hat also looks amazing. You come up with the best ideas ever. Keep it up.
Thank you for sharing your how to's and creation ideas - inspiring! If I may, did you sew the coiled felt together?
Yes, Luna. You're correct. I hand stitched the coil together. Though none on the stitching shows from the front. The felt is thick enough that I only had to grab enough to tack to the other side. You could probably just glue it together.
Projects and inspiration for everyday crafting using mainly discarded materials or supplies found locally. I'll be updating my 3 blogs whenever I create something new. Feel free to comment. I enjoy the feedback.

Female game individual is tossed behind bars in Iran for posting photos of her workouts on Instagram
Royalty free holiday clip art of a cheerful stick man wearing pink bunny ears and holding a spring sign.
Natasha, (click here to visit her incredible Instagram!), hired us to create another themed dessert table. This time, for her daughter… an enchanted fairy garden party!
As always, she requested that everything be made with organic, vegan, gluten-free, soy-free ingredients, natural colors and flavors, and to have a reduced amount of sugars while using primarily Whole Foods. We used Harry’s Berries Gaviota Strawberries – the best strawberries in the world – and India Tree colors, turmeric, and blue spirulina to color the treats.
Coming up with ideas for food using Pinterest really helped bring this dessert table to life. Here is what we came up with…
Moss Cookies – sugar cookies with a hint of lemon, coated with a thin icing, covered with pulverized and green-colored coconut shreds.
Gnome Made Granola Cups with Honeysuckle Cream – my granola recipe with more date paste to stick the cups together, baked in mini cupcake pans, with spooned in yogurt, berries, and mint.

The field of alternative cancer therapies includes at least 500 different treatments. The Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is involved in evaluating such treatments. Many cancer survivors have gone outside the mainstream to explore treatments that are either less invasive or less toxic or possibly more effective than conventional therapies.
If you have been diagnosed with an illness that has been labeled as terminal or one for which there is no safe or proven cure-you should be allowed to choose or purchase any drug or treatment that may help, so long as it will do no harm.
With so much information available to the public about alternative treatment modalities, it is important to seek professional advice to assist in your decision making. At Maine Whole Health Center Dr. Krassner can guide you in bridging conventional and complementary cancer therapies.

i picked out the book Extra Yarn by Mac Barnett by chance at our library. I know they say you can't judge a book by its cover, but the cover of this book was so gorgeous, it just drew me in. {sorry, not the greatest with the arrow and all...but at least it matches my color scheme}
it was obvious to me that whatever activity we did for this book had to have yarn incorporated into it. so we dyed our own yard using food coloring. Bear thought it was neat to see it change color. {it was also funny to see The Sergeant and Pip's faces when they thought i dyed spaghetti}
the next day, i put the yarn into a small box similar to how it was in the book. Bear thought it would be fun to "knit" with it {righthand image}.
ever since i learned about Huichol yarn painting in a multicultural art class last year, i've wanted to do try it with Bear. some of the images artists come up with using this technique are just amazing! to create his, i provided a piece of cardboard, our homemade colored glue, and small pieces of the yarn we dyed for him to arrange and glue down however he chose.
this is his final result. i'm going to be adding a real frame around it and a hook to the back so it can hang on the wall.
after we had read the book, i began thinking about the similarities in the book between the box of yarn the little girl had and the abundance of love that God has for us to share with each other. no matter who the little girl makes a sweater for, she still has more and more yarn. which connects to the fact that no matter how much love we share with others, He always refills our cup. so many connotations in this book. i'd be interested in hearing your thoughts on this after you read the book.
using this idea, i helped Bear write up a list of things that we can do to share God's love with others. here's what we came up with:

A2Hosting is an online service provider that has been around since 2003. Based in Houston, TX the company claims to have hosted over a million websites through their service to date. Though A2Hosting has been around for more than a decade, they are not as popular as some of the other hosting companies on the market today. In fact, many people have never even heard of them.
That, however, is quickly changing since A2Hosting was purchased by Endurance International Group and went through a major revamp and re-launch in 2015. Initially, A2Hosting was running on older cPanel. However, as part of the revamp, not only did they get a whole new website design, but they also switched over to the latest cPanel.
This move enabled them to provide their customers with a more reliable and feature-rich control panel. A2Hosting also introduced a bevy of new features down the line with a new low price.
In other words, the purpose of the revamp was to offer their customers more flexibility. They want their customers to be able to easily choose which options and features they wanted to use.
Going out from this A2Hosting review we are going to dive a little deeper and discuss all things A2Hosting. In essence, we are going to analyze uptime, reliability, the pros and cons of the service and much more.
If you are looking for a budget friendly host, you will absolutely love A2Hosting. For just $2.75 per month you will get a free domain name, unlimited add on domains, unlimited data transfer, unmetered storage capacity, access to hundreds of A2Hosting templates, a free email address and free marketing tools.
Please note in order to be eligible for the $2.75 per month option you must opt for the 36-month term. There are also shorter terms for a higher monthly fee.
With A2Hosting you will get everything you need to succeed online. And while most online service providers seem identical on the surface, in reality they are not. Here are a few additional features that come with A2Hosting plans:
With A2Hosting you will have access to all the best tools on the Web. You will be able to create a blog, build an online store or set up a photo gallery with the click of a button. It doesn’t get any better than that!
When developing a web presence for business or personal use, there are many small factors that play into the success of the website, yet the one large decision you must make is who is going to host the website. Literally thousands of websites are in existence that offer web hosting with outstanding platforms, programs that will bolster your search engine presence, and more; so, how do you choose?
The process is simple: look for affordability, up-time and guarantees that go above and beyond the call of service, which is best found within the services of WebHostingHub, a premier solution for the business and personal site users that want great service from a server and not pay outrageously for it.
With the ability to create a site in literally 5 minutes and offering a free domain with your purchase, the service that you’ll receive is evident in the efforts WebHostingHub puts into their packaged services. They allow you to pick a domain for free when you choose their services, letting you literally be online as fast as 90 minutes from the time you purchase their services. What an excellent service they are!
Not only do they offer software platforms for blogging, such as WordPress and b2Evolution, which are the standard in today’s world of blogging. Simply choose the platform you want from your control panel, and you’ll be on your way by clicking the installation button and let the blog install itself; excellent for beginning to novice blog users. Read more about this on Hosting Manual.
For those that would like to incorporate e-commerce into their new website, WebHostingHub is top-notch by offering the best shopping carts, such as ZenCart, CubeCart, and OS Commerce, while offering a share SSL platform for a level of security that your customers can come to rely on.
While offering your customers online shopping in a safe format, you can also expect to receive the same deep levels of security with content management systems such as Joomla, Drupal, Geeklog, Mambo and Moodle.
WebHostingHub simply cares for your online presence to the point they offer these platforms free of charge and assist with the install of the programs, too.
Have a large group of people that need email addresses? No problem; you will receive, with your domain, unlimited email addresses as well as forwarding options to connect mail that comes to specific boxes with users who have email elsewhere.
And one of our favorite features about WebHostingHub is there ‘No-Downtime Transfer’ guarantee, which means that while your site is being moved, a temporary URL will be created to streamline your move and still allow visitors to come by and purchase or interact with you at the old location.
With a top notch customer service group that is standing by online at all times, tech support that is educated and willing to go the distance, and prices that are well below the industry standard for what you receive, the choice is obvious for new businesses and personal bloggers to choose WebHostingHub today.
Ecommerce hosting is a special type of hosting available for companies that wish to have an online store. In fact, ecommerce is just a fancy technical name for a web shop. Some of the most visited websites on the planet, such as Amazon.com or Ebay.com are sites specializing in ecommerce and trading online.
Whatever business you have, you can find many good providers on the Internet, who will have fully-fledged applications in order for you to be able to set up your web shop.
It’s always a good idea to look at the competition whenever you are trying to set up a business. It’s no different when you’re searching for an ecommerce hosting provider. If you’re in the business of selling used books online, or you’re starting up a trading company in your local area powered by the Internet, then you would do well to take a look at some of the more popular sites to see if you can find a provider that will give you many of the features that make these companies successful in the first place.
A good rating system powered by users. Concerning ecommerce hosting, one of the most important aspects of any ecommerce website is a good rating system that is driven by the users themselves. Potential clients would like to know whether a product is worth investing in or not and the best way you can do this (apart from of course making high quality products in the first place!) is to allow them to rate and comment on their purchases.
You can use a 5 star system or a value out of 10, but whichever you pick you should allow them to talk about the pros and cons of the product they have bought and also compare it to other similar products. Some sites also allow their clients to write reviews about their products. For instance, when you buy a book on Amazon.com, you can write a book review about it which every person who searches for that book will see.
Excellent categories and a fast database. When you’re searching for ecommerce hosting, you need to find a provider that gives dedicated servers that will allow you to store massive amounts of data, with potentially thousands (or in the case of Ebay, millions) of clients clicking on links at the same time. Nothing is more frustrating to a user than waiting for links to load while they are searching for something.
Shopping carts and one-click purchasing. Online shopping carts can be a valuable tool for consumers who would like to buy more than one product at a time in a bulk order. It should be flexible and allow users to add and remove products with ease, and the price should be updated automatically. For instance, on the Apple Store (store.apple.com) the price automatically updates as you add and remove items when you are building a new computer or buying an iPad. One click purchasing is another excellent tool that you should be looking for in an ecommerce hosting site, which allows returning customers to make purchases quickly with the click of the button once they are logged in.
Client registration and military-grade security and encryption. Clients should be able to register accounts. This is especially true if you are trading in electronic currency. When customers purchase an item, they should be able to securely input their credit card information and remove it if they no longer need your services. The ecommerce hosting company that you select should be Verisign authorized and provide secure, SSL transactions for electronic purchases. There are so many stories in the news these days of major companies losing sensitive customer financial information to hackers, so you have to make sure you have all your security issues covered.
Suggested purchases. Based on customer history, many ecommerce hosting sites provide a list of suggested purchases. For instance, if a customer likes to buy books written by Stephen King and Dean Koontz on Amazon, then after a while Amazon will suggest similar titles to that customer. This is a very effective marketing strategy and can significantly boost your sales.
Contact information and quick customer service. Your ecommerce hosting provider should provide quick customer service to your clients. They should have call centers as well as online options such as e-mail or chat rooms, and any billing issues should be resolved as soon as possible. All your contact information should be provided on the website and customers should feel that they can trust you with their money.
Here is a list of other things that you should ideally be looking for when you are searching for an ecommerce hosting company:
Whatever the product you sell, or whatever the service you provide, partnering with a special ecommerce hosting company instead of trying to set everything up by yourself or with limited help on standard domain name registrars is a good idea. Going the route of the ecommerce hosting is by far the more efficient way of doing business, because you can worry less about the administration and technical aspects of the web store and worry more about the important things, such as customer service and great products.

Louisville suffers no shortage of available music venues in town, more so than you may expect for a city of our size. While many spaces in town cater to a diverse set of musical interests, there are a number of places that, for one reason or another, tend to attract a specific genre. Here you’ll find the best rooms for the tunes that rock your world. (You can exclude places like Headliners or The Louisville Palace here, not because they aren’t exemplary spots to see fantastic music, but because both offer an incredibly mixed bag of disparate artists.)
The jazz community in Louisville scattered after the closing of the Jazz Factory several years ago, but that doesn’t mean it’s not here. Visiting the Louisville Jazz Society web site yields a variety of places to catch the genre in one form or another, and perhaps none quite so exciting as Germantown’s Nachbar, which features jazz that skews a bit more eclectic than not.
Folk or singer/songwriter music is a hard genre to find a good home for, given the tame nature of the music. For those seeking a comfortable locale without too much ambient noise to get intimate with the music, look no further than Gallery K. Located on Barret Avenue in Butchertown, Gallery K is a coffeehouse that welcomes the quiet and pensive moments that suit folk and similar forms so well.
Depending on how you identify punk rock, Third Street Dive is right on the money. True to its name, this is a dive bar with all the trappings: neon lights, dingy interiors, ample beer on tap, bathroom decked out in band stickers, and a pool table in the corner. But the centerpiece of this downtown bar is the stage area positioned right at the entrance, the home to plenty of bands out there just trying to make a little noise.
Where once The New Vintage offered an intimate spot to bust out your prized leather jacket and spiked gauntlets, Diamonds Pub & Billiards Highlands is still a rocksteady location to get in the pit and try to love someone. The room is large and open, but no less conducive to venting your aggression at maximum volumes. The venue hosts bands like Powerman 5000, Superjoint Ritual (featuring Pantera’s Phil Anselmo), hometown metalcore acts like Knocked Loose, and a heap of bands decked out in all black, midnight dwellers out to scream at the sun. Put on your black face paint and get into it.
Honestly, pretty much anywhere you can catch local hip-hop is a good spot, given the quality of the overall content, but if there were any one spot to pick, it’s certainly the Mercury Ballroom. It’s here that you can catch not only the biggest names coming up in town like Dr. Dundiff & Friends, 1200, Kogan Dumb, and more, but where you can see acts like Ghostface Killah and Raekwon or Joey Bada$$. A mid-sized venue, there is ample space to move around and plenty of good vantage points for the stage.
For those seeking the weirder side of life, there is no better place than dREAMLAND. Located behind Decca in NuLu, dREAMLAND occupies the space that used to be the chapel for Wayside Christian Mission, which makes for some interesting acoustics. Performances range from improv jazz or electronic groups, to established acts like Will Oldham, Faust, or Skull Defekts who may show up on their way through town. This is the vanguard of weird and host to some of the most compelling and often indescribable music out there. Case in point: Sonic Youth guitarist Lee Ranaldo recently played a set.
Get a weekly dose of bluegrass at Germantown’s Barret Bar and walk away feeling good about yourself. Featuring a regular get down once per week, the Barret Bar is the spot to post up and tap into some old timey goodness. Typically hosted on the patio, grab some fresh air and let your mind wander outside of the city for a moment, moved by some gleeful picking and grinning.
The calendar for Gerstle’s Place, located in St. Matthews, is a who’s who of local cover band talent, and a mecca for those seeking to take a load off. The venue is a small compound with several stages spaced throughout different areas in the bar. This is where you go on a Friday night after work, with a cold beer in hand, and an open mind to hearing the best of classic rock.
It may come as a surprise to catch dance or electronica music in a dive bar, but Mag Bar offers the best of the best. With a good beer selection and multiple rooms to choose from, this Old Louisville venue is an excellent host to folks looking to rock a drum machine or turn table in a bid to get people moving.
There is stiff competition for best spot to see some of the best up-and-coming indie rock in the city, but Zanzabar wins out by staying consistent. Several nights a week you can catch anything ranging from Andrew W.K. to Young Widows to Earth and beyond, making sweet noise in this great Saint Joseph spot. The stage is reasonably short, making it feel like you’re right there with the band. The sound is great and there are plenty of places to visit if your ears need a break, including an excellently maintained arcade. Combine that with a good beer selection and great food and you’re in the right spot.

We have a wealth of brilliant articles on our website covering the many various aspects of affiliate marketing in depth, however, for those of you who are completely new to the concept, I’m going to go back to basics and explain in detail exactly what affiliate marketing is, what it takes to succeed and how you could become a successful affiliate marketer, too.
Most marketers track and analyze a variety of metrics when it comes to their digital marketing efforts, especially for e-commerce. Some of the metrics are largely useless, others are very interrelated, and maybe only a few are the critical KPIs. Here, we’ll examine the most important metric of them all when assessing your e-commerce website. Specific to digital marketing and e-commerce, I’ll argue that the most important (and often most misunderstood) metric is Revenue Per Visitor, or RPV.
If you want to sell products online, you may can it by creating your own website. As there's lot of competition and several existing websites in place already catering to this market, an attempt to create a niche in terms of products may be considered. Or, you can use the platform such as Amazon, Flipkart to sell. One can increase reach and visibility through affiliate marketing.
Not promoting the right products is a common issue with newbie affiliates. Would you purchase the product you are promoting through a website? Think about it. You can advertise a Ford dealership on your website until the cows come home, but will anyone seriously purchase a brand new car via a website without visiting a garage? I don’t think so. Don’t market cars, houses, wedding venues, perfume or dogs online. Do market products people will actually buy from a website without seeing them in the flesh!
23. Affiliates – There are many affiliate networks, such as FlexOffers and CJ Affiliate that allow you to promote other people’s products and services. You simply put a link or a banner on your page and then you get a percentage if someone clicks through and buys the product/service. You’ll want to select products that are specifically within your blog’s category.This is an effective way to earn money once you have the traffic coming to your blog.
Okay, so passive income is where it’s at. Clearly, it will allow you to scale things out and make far more money. But it doesn’t happen quickly. However, most people don’t have the upfront investments to get things off the ground when it comes to areas such as real estate, dividends from stocks or ATM and vending machines. For that reason, they need to turn to digital avenues for income generation.

During Network Field Day 17 in January, VeloCloud gave a presentation about SD-WAN and there were a few surprises that I wanted to write down to make sure I got them right. Here is the primary video that outlines the features.
VeloCloud wants to present a vision of SD-WAN as automated, contextual, and self-learning. I would call that intent-based networking.
The idea of “self-learning and adaptation” is unusual among SD-WAN vendors. Many network engineers focus on declarative networking with hard coding of all variables. The idea of self-configuration and automated change is anathema to many because product quality is so poor that it’s unsafe to trust the software. It’s certainly true that SD-WAN is automated configuration that works.
I was not aware that VeloCloud (or any SD-WAN solution) is PCI DSS compliant. Having a compliant WAN network does substantially reduce the burden of auditing and validation.
At this point in the presentation (1540seconds) Service Providers can extend their network footprint by federating or using the physical networks of other regional providers.
If you have ever spent time working on carrier-to-carrier MPLS at a technology level you will appreciate this. If you have sat through business meetings where two carriers agree to carry each other’s traffic ……. well, you can guess the level of sadness I’ve experienced.
Telcos get visibility into performance of the interconnection and can force the partner to deliver the agreed level of service for carried traffic.
We saw a demo of a Palo Alto VNF being instantiated on the VeloCloud edge device using the SDN controller. It was as simple as adding a license to VeloCloud Orchestrator to instantiate an instance on the branch appliance and then completing the cycle by registering with the PAN Panorama monitoring platform.
Here is the video showing a demonstration of the workflow that includes the licensing and monitoring of PANW virtual services. That’s quite impressive to me.

Bob Marley is the “Reggae King.” He’s the Jamaican musician, singer & songwriter most responsible for reggae’s international success. A pioneer who’s earliest fame came with good friends Peter Tosh & Bunny Wailer as Bob Marley & The Wailers. “Simmer Down” was one of their ska classics. Bob drove a BMW not because he loved the car. It’s because he loved the letters BMW. They stood for Bob Marley & the Wailers.
Bob resurrected an old time 60’s tune and turned it into a soft stoned love poem. “We’ll be together with a roof right over our head.” “We’ll share the shelter of my single bed.” This would be a popular theme as several Marley songs lead to his single bed. He’s fathered 11 children. Rumor is there’s many more. But no one’s done “The Math!” After solo careers for Bob and these Wailers, he achieved fortune, fame and an idolization that’s as powerful today as when he was gone in 1981.
He’s sold 15 million albums in the U.S. and 25 million worldwide. He continues to outsell most reggae artists 30 years after his passing. Bob Marley’s estate earned $21 million last year Marley’s huge reggae influence and inspiration will always have him at # 1. His worldwide classics “One Love,” “Stir It Up,” “No Woman” “No Cry,” “Buffalo Soldier,” & “Could You Be Loved,” are anthems everywhere reggae music is celebrated.
These favorites offer a common Bob Marley theme. Overcome social injustice, no matter what the question might be. Love is the answer and always will be the answer. He offered “Love the Life you Lead” “Live the Life You Love.” “There will never be.” “No love at all!” “Don’t worry about a thing.” “Every little thing is gonna be alright.” Smoking herb is and always will be the gospel. “Smoking herb helps us free our minds.” “Smoking weed reveals you to yourself.” “Why should I drink and drive.” “When I can smoke and fly.”
We thank Bob Marley for his great music, spirit and generosity. Celebrating the man who gave “No Woman” “No Cry,” songwriting credit to Vincent Ford. His childhood pal from the Trenchtown Ghetto in Kingston. These residual checks helped Vincent keep his Trenchtown Soup Kitchen open for his entire lifetime.
We celebrate “Reggae Icon Time,” as we share our Bob Marley 1981 special issue first day cover cancelled envelope. Each stamp features a different image of Marley set against a sheet of music of one of his songs. My Forever Treasures leaves you with these Bob Marley words. “The day you stop racing.” “Is the day you’ve won the race.” **All of our clients are Winners.:)
Seeing a lot of “the sky is falling” sentiment last night and this morning from people who are genuinely shocked that a blatantly racist and misogynistic buffoon like Donald Trump could become the de facto Republican nominee, and who have equated that with Trump’s ability to win in the general election. I’ve also seen more than one person cite this blog post by Scott Adams as argument for Trump’s strength in the general and his ability to pivot towards the center. (The fact that the argument for Scott Adams’ intelligence is his capability to recycle the same dozen gags over and over again to get people to buy Dilbert merchandise seems to have been momentarily lost.) The other big argument is that pundits got Trump’s chances wrong across the board and thought he could never win the nomination.
To this, speaking as someone who started predicting a likely Trump nomination victory in November of last year and advised people not to write off his chances as early as August – in short, as someone who has been more or less continually right about Trump’s chances all along – I’m going to say now: although it is not impossible for Donald Trump to win the general election against Hillary Clinton (it is never impossible; that is the nature of a two-party system), there is probably not a worse candidate with the possible exception of Ted Cruz that they could have nominated to go against Hillary, and every piece of actual data we have, rather than pundit sentiment, says that Trump is going to get absolutely murdered in the general.
Firstly, consider the low baseline. There are 18 states (plus the District of Columbia) that have gone Democratic in every election since 1992: Washington, Oregon, California, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Rhode Island, Maryland and Hawaii. Every single one of those states right now currently polls a hypothetical Hillary/Trump matchup with Hillary winning. In most cases she’s winning by ten points or more. If she wins all of these traditionally strongly Democratic states, and then wins Florida – where she presently beats Trump in the hypothetical matchup by thirteen points – that’s the ballgame because she has enough electoral votes to win. If she loses Florida but wins Ohio and Nevada (where she also leads Trump in general election matchups), she wins too. If she loses Florida, Ohio and Nevada but takes New Hampshire, Colorado and Virginia, she still wins. In order for Trump to have a shot of winning he has to crush Hillary and win essentially everywhere that he stands even a modest chance of winning. He has to be perfect.
He won’t be. There is a difference between winning a hyperpolarized Republican primary, where you can essentially say anything and it doesn’t matter, and winning the general. The modern GOP doesn’t really give a shit about policy; they’re a party founded on resentment (of liberals, of minorities, of foreigners, etc.) and if you express that resentment for them they’ll follow you over a cliff, which is how Trump won. But, across the board, he won a plurality of GOP voters – not even a majority, although by the end he’ll probably have a slight majority of overall votes and delegates. Trump is massively unpopular. His net unfavorability rating is averaging around negative twenty-five percent. Hillary, who is widely disliked, only averages around negative twelve percent – and historically that gets better whenever she’s obviously the target of sexist attacks. Donald Trump will be incredibly misogynistic towards Hillary because that’s who he is:
And if Trump has a weakness – he has many, actually. Trump’s personal and business history is loaded with egregiously awful things that will make glorious attack ad fodder, more juicy than the ad above. But his defining weakness is that he is a bully and when he gets challenged he loses his temper. His few moments of discomfiture during the Republican debates came when he was attacked, and during the GOP campaign his opponents could not call him out on many of his weaknesses because to the GOP primary audience they were strengths, but they will not be strengths with the general electorate.
Since we are talking about hypothetical general election matchups, let us talk about Bernie Sanders for a bit, because at this point in the campaign hypothetical election matchups are really all that is left. He and Hillary agree on too many policies for it to be otherwise; Bernie himself has pivoted to talking primarily about how he is best suited to beat Trump (or any other GOP candidate, but really, it was Trump everybody was talking about). The argument for Bernie is as follows: Hillary is unpopular; Bernie is not. Hillary does all right in hypothetical Trump matchups; Bernie does better. Therefore, Bernie is better equipped to beat Trump.
The problem is that Bernie is simply wrong about this. The argument assumes that Hillary and Bernie are equal quantities; they are not. Whatever one thinks of Hillary, she is a known quantity to the general American public; she can’t not be. Everybody in America has their opinions about Hillary more or less set already. Bernie is not a known quantity, and there is ample fodder for attack ads that the Hillary campaign has never touched. For example: in 1980, Bernie was an elector for the Socialist Workers Party. In 1980, the Socialist Workers Party called for solidarity with the revolutionary regime in Iran during the Iranian hostage crisis. The attack ad writes itself. As does the one where Sanders applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. And the one where he called for the abolishment of the Armed Forces in the 70s. And the one where he was arguing that military budgets should be halved in the 90s. All of these will hurt Bernie, some more than others, but he will have trouble arguing back against them because they all happen to be true.
And this is before we get to the big problem, which is that Bernie is a self-identified socialist. (Over the last couple years he’s started saying “democratic socialist” but it doesn’t really matter.) It’s literally the least popular trait a presidential candidate can have. According to polling, fifty percent of Americans would not vote for a socialist Presidential candidate. That’s worse than “atheist” (forty percent), “Muslim” (38 percent) and “gay” (24 percent). Even if we assume that’s soft and Bernie can get one out of five of them to consider it once he explains his policy enough, that still means only sixty percent of the electorate would be even willing to consider voting for Bernie.
This doesn’t mean that Bernie can’t beat Trump. He may well be able to do so. But it does mean arguments that he can beat Trump more easily than Hillary can because of current polling are facile arguments with no real weight to them.
Another thing with Trump is that he mostly won in Democrat states. It doesn’t matter what happened in the primary, there is no realistic chance that New York votes Republican.
Yeah. Boy. On the one hand, I’m kind of glad that Trump is the GOP candidate, because I really don’t think he can win. On the other hand, there’s this little voice in my head that says, “The media gave him over $2 billion in free advertising in the primary…and they hate Hillary.” It says, “Lots of pretty smart people thought Trump would fail in the primary, like FiveThirtyEight.com, and he still won.” It says, “There’s a lot of really stupid people who somehow think that Scott Adams isn’t a hack.” That voice is what makes me worry.
I’d rather we had better democratic candidates (Joe Biden, how I wish you had run…or Warren or Sherrod Brown). I think Hillary’s a little too eager to flex our military muscles down here and tends to resort to force first because she’s afraid of being called soft. I suspect that if Hillary wins, we’re likely going to get involved in at least one, if not two, major military engagements within 4 years (my bet is North Korea and either Palestine or Syria). I don’t think Sanders was a better choice, but I don’t think Hillary’s the best we, as a country, can do. I wonder – is this what people felt like when they voted Buchannan or Harding or Pierce?
I think people tend to forget that Hillary’s negatives may not be as high as they can go. She’s never actually been seriously campaigned against by a Republican (Lazio ran a hands-off campaign and Spencer was a lets-pretend-to-run-someone-against-her thing.) When the kinds of attacks that Obama and Sanders wouldn’t think of making actually start going on in prime time her net favorables could drop to within the margin of error of Trumps.
I don’t like Hillary (and the thought of Bill being around the White House for four to eight years again makes me nauseous), but the thought of that temper tantrum piece of shit egomaniac with the emotional control of a two year old being anywhere near the nuclear launch codes makes it no contest: Hillary all the way.
“As does the one where Sanders applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War. And the one where he called for the abolishment of the Armed Forces in the 70s. And the one where he was arguing that military budgets should be halved in the 90s.”
Everything wrong about Americans can be summed up by how negative these traits will play in the election. God forbid someone have a conscious and not automatically fellate our Brave Men And Women In Uniform.
My main concern at this point is due to the high negatives of both presumptive candidates, and their highly polarized public personas, predicting the makeup of the electorate that actually shows up in November is going to be very difficult. There are people who simply won’t turn out to vote for either of them, or will vote for the other candidate in a ‘cut off your nose to spite your face’ scenario, and that’s going to play havoc with all the models. Plus, there’s general fatigue of the old familiar faces; from 1980 until 2012, a Clinton or a Bush has been President, Vice President, or Secretary of State, as well as those same people or family members being Senators or Governors. The streak ended in 2012 just so people of those names could run for President.
I honestly think we’re headed to the lowest turnout year in quite some time. I don’t trust a single poll that’s matched the two of them, and won’t until we’re much closer to the election and the Nate Silvers of the world have been able to get a look at voter engagement for the general. And even then, I’ll be skeptical.
@Jeff R.: Hillary has been the object of a near-non-stop Republican smear campaign for 25 years. There is nothing they can throw at her that they haven’t already.
@Sean C.: There are plenty of lines of attack that have never significantly crossed the boundaries of the modern dual epistemically closed media worlds. When we get to the national ad campaigns and debates, those barriers are coming down.
(Assuming there are debates this year. If I were advising HRC, I’d be strongly considering refusing to debate Trump, either directly or engineering a negotiations breakdown.)
I still have this feeling that eventually Trump will finally just admit that he doesn’t really WANT to be President, which is far more work than he is prepared for, and that all of this was just an introduction to his newest Reality Show.
@Michael: Sure. The average non-fox-viewer who isn’t wonkish enough to religiously follow Vox isn’t currently aware of Juanita Broadrick’s account. That’s not going to last.
That would be terrible advice. Hillary is an excellent debater and Trump is actually a bad one when he’s not performing for your standard audience of Republican flying monkeys. His jibes will lose a lot of their effectiveness when nobody is allowed to cheer him (as is standard for Presidential debates), and when he isn’t allowed to shut down his opponent by talking over them he gets hit badly. Plus, he’s a rampant misogynist and he’ll look like a bully when he cracks about Clinton’s looks, which he will do because he can’t help himself.
@Jeff: I had to look her up, but I remember all that from back when Bill was president. No one cared then (all of this bullshit actually increased his popularity) and certainly no one will care now. Are you seriously arguing that after 2 years of the Republicans publicly calling her a traitor that a dismissed rape allegation against her husband from 2 decades ago will change anything?
Criticism of hawkishness from the left is very well-known by now. But there’s a right-wing variant of it too, a mix of isolationism, pragmatic reasonableness, and self-interest on the rare occasion they’re all on the same side. Ron Paul, for example, described 9/11 as blowback. Trump has said that 9/11 was partially Bush’s fault (I can’t be bothered to look up the exact phrasing, but if you Google Romney’s speech on Trump, he objects to it there), and he would be happy to blame Clinton for it too. Voted for the Iraq war while in the Senate, the other Clinton laid the groundwork while president… Except Trump would not be making a L’Internationale no-blood-for-oil argument, he’s making a screw-them-all, not-our-problem argument. Big difference.
It’s only arguably true that she’s never faced that criticism before, and I’m not saying I find it persuasive, but I think it’s worth mentioning.
When a candidate has been running over a year, has collected a record-setting $200 million in donations, and has won twenty states, and yet he’s an “unknown quantity,” it really demonstrates how broken things are.
Unknown versus who? We all know Rubio and Kasich, who each won a whopping one state. Sanders has been an elected official since 1981 and federally since 1991. He trumps Clinton on experience by double and gave us 8.5 hours of straight talk during a 2010 filibuster.
That’s not an unknown quantity, that’s the party and the media doing everything they can to slow down progressive candidates so they can continue the shift to the right.
@Alan Pugh: Sanders is an unknown quantity because he has never been the subject of nationwide political attention before 2015, and he has never had the entire GOP smear machine running hard negative against him. His political experience has been confined to Vermont, where he is well-known and well-loved.
@Cyrus Correct me if I’m wrong, but hasn’t Trump been going around saying he’ll force other countries to basically give us tribute at gunpoint? In any case, Trump has been for every war before he decided he was against it, like Libya or Iraq.
The first one might have worked in other elections (and, if Trump wins, it might very well work in 2020), but in *this* election, people are sick to death of “politics as usual” and “The System,” and are in love with the idea of a political outsider who doesn’t answer to “The Party” and “Special Interests.” It’s why, instead of just walking in and claiming the Democratic nomination virtually unchallenged, Clinton is having such a hard time against Sanders, a Socialist and minor figure that few people had ever heard of.
As for point #2, “I’m not [The Other Guy] is not a winning platform. It never has been. It can’t be. It only tells them what you’re *not*, not what you *are.* It’s one of the big reasons Dubya beat Kerry and Obama beat Romney. It’s why Trump blew all of the other Republican candidates out of the water. When your position is “I’m not The Other Guy,” people aren’t thinking about *you.* They’re thinking about The Other Guy.
Trump says he’ll Make America Great Again. Clinton says she’s not Trump. Hence, Clinton *won’t* Make America Great Again. (Yes, that’s horribly flawed logic and completely stupid. It doesn’t matter. It’ll be in the back of people’s brains as they go to the voting booths.)
Trump’s unpopular because he ran his mouth and said a lot of stupid inflammatory shit, but wait until he starts campaigning in the general election. He radiates confidence (even if it’s unwarranted) that Clinton does not. He has a sort of charm (albiet a loudmouth, scumbaggy kind of charm); Clinton does not. Expect the polling numbers to change significantly once the general election campaign kicks in.
Now, there’s still the very real chance that Trump’s victory in the Republican race was a pyrrhic one and he sabotaged his chances in the general election. But I wouldn’t count on that. If I were a gambling man, I’d bet on President Trump.
“but in *this* election, people are sick to death of “politics as usual” and “The System,” and are in love with the idea of a political outsider who doesn’t answer to “The Party” and “Special Interests.” ”
People are always sick of politics as usual and the system. Always. Trump’s supporters have more specific issues: they’re sick of not getting what they want. They’re sick of their jobs getting outsourced (I’m with them on that one), of Obamacare not getting overturned, that a Christian nation is allowing Muslims to supposedly take over, that it’s not like the good old days when men were men and women were women.Trump’s hatemongering is the same vision Republicans have been pushing since the 1980s, that if they vote for him, he’ll fix all that. He’s not just offering himself as a political outsider but as someone who’s willing to insult Mexicans, Muslims and women and never back down in the face of “political correctness.” And that after failing to win in Iraq or Afghanistan, he’ll conquer ISIS/Iraq/Iran and take their oil, wall off the Mexican border and make them pay for it, etc., etc. And for a lot of people on the right, that vision of American Empire is pretty appealing.
The assumption that because Sanders voters want change, they’ll buy what Trump’s selling, is just nonsensical. I wouldn’t rule out a Trump victory, but not for the reasons you cite.
It’s true that Trump won (mainly) on opposition to politics as usual… in the Republican primary, against a weak field. The claim that the field was weak is hard to be scientific about, admittedly, but there’s definitely a big difference between the Republican primary and the general election. Democrats and people who don’t vote in primaries may not enjoy politics as usual, but I doubt they hate politics as usual enough to vote for Trump.
It’s also worth mentioning that nobody in the Republican Party could muster up a convincing rebuttal to Trump’s arguments because they’ve been pushing much the same line of thought for several decades. The difference between Jeb Bush and Donald Trump is basically nuance–Bush wants to discriminate and exploit Mexicans, while Trump wants to deport them. It’s awful hard for Bush to strike a strong, decisive tone against Trump while simultaneously explaining to hard-right voters that he still hates the minorities of the world just like they do.
Clinton, on the other hand, will be able to eviscerate his arguments without having to worry about her own base tearing her apart for apostasy. She can say a lot of the things that none of the Republican candidates could, and Trump has no defense against those things because his entire policy is basically cribbed out of the back of a Jack Chick tract that someone peed on.
Clinton is also not currently campaigning against Donald Trump. If she wins the nomination, and she continues to run on the platform of “you’d have to be an idiot to vote for that guy,” then you’re 100% correct, she’ll absolutely lose, and deservedly so. I’m hopeful that she’s learned something from Ann Richards and Al Gore, though.
I dislike Trump. That said, what’s laughable to me are the people who think Hillary is a better option. She is not! The only people who think this, are bias liberals (like the author of this piece) that have digested Hillary’s many blatant lies as to be something else. Meaning, many Democrats are phony, naïve and perhaps liars just like Hillary.
Furthermore, the Democrat Party is not “hyperpolarized” ? Hillary, who has a MASSIVE machine behind her, is unable to put away a crazy old socialist. Her crowds/events are boring snoozers, while Bernie’s base is fired-up! Let’s stop playing pretend, the Democrats are also polarized.

I usually say I became a journalist by accident. I needed money to get me through art school so I started writing art reviews for a friend on a local paper.
Suddenly writing became more important than painting, so I dropped out of art school and began an even more precarious life as a freelance journalist. As it turned out I had a series of lucky breaks and quickly found myself editor of a national monthly for gay men. Having made the jump from novice writer to editor in under-eighteen-months, I learned a lot very quickly – learning through immersion, pressure and instinct.
Ten years later, mid-career ennui led me to the UTS Masters in Journalism. After being an editor of both a monthly magazine and a weekly newspaper it wasn’t practical skills I was after, I wanted a space to think about what I was doing. I found it: a space for thinking and doing, I ended up staying to work on a PhD and teach young journalists.
That story sums up my philosophy of teaching and learning: we learn by doing and thinking and good teaching assists both thinking through doing and doing through thinking. And around the circle goes. It’s what the literature calls reflective practice.
It also sums up my attitude to the tired practice versus theory, industry-based versus university-based training debates that still plague journalism education. I believe the most successful courses integrate theory and practice.
My approach to teaching starts with setting up a conversation and good conversation has both ideas and examples.
My basic goal as a teacher is to provide the scaffolding students need to climb and explore new subject towers safely and adventurously. The practical ways I do this are familiar: participating in discussions, listening and asking questions, offering suggestions, pointing to resources, being available for consultation and critically: completing the feedback loop in carefully planned formative assessments. Case studies bring theory alive and theoretical readings provide a framework for discussion of journalism practice.
One model of learning that has been influential for me has been the idea of learning through Authentic Tasks developed by Jan Herrington and colleagues. An authentic task have a range of important dimensions but the first three defined by Herrington are critical:
Authentic tasks have real-world relevance Activities match as nearly as possible the real-world tasks of professionals in practice rather than decontextualised or classroom-based tasks.
Authentic tasks are ill-defined, requiring students to define the tasks and sub-tasks needed to complete the activity Problems inherent in the tasks are ill-defined and open to multiple interpretations rather than easily solved by the application of existing algorithms. Learners must identify their own unique tasks and sub-tasks in order to complete the major task.
Authentic tasks comprise complex tasks to be investigated by students over a sustained period of time Tasks are completed in days, weeks and months rather than minutes or hours, requiring significant investment of time and intellectual resources.
Commitment to this open ended model of learning and assessment means working hard to support students through the various stages of its development. Although the tasks need to be open-ended or “ill-defined” to allow for personal/multiple interpretations it is also critical that students know exactly what is being asked of them. So very specific and detailed assignment outlines, assessment criteria and additional resources and examples are also important in modeling the multiple possible outcomes of any given task.
In many of our lab-based classes at UOW, assignments are modular or portfolio based, ensuring tasks gradually build towards the submission of a key piece of work, or collection of stories after drafts have been discussed and students have had a chance to learn from feedback and discussion. This models the professional environment of journalist editor interaction. In other classes work-in-progress seminar presentations that focus on the development and improvement of the major assignment throughout the semester. Students are thus encouraged to do their best possible work over time, integrating feedback from their classmates and myself as tutor, rather than just aiming for a make or break end of semester deadline.
Journalism and many of the creative professions are industries in upheaval and transition so a key outcome of our teaching and learning programs must be building resilience, and equipping our students for the long haul of constant reflection, learning and innovation. Developing students ability to reflect on their learning process is a key skill and I encourage this through an ongoing process called The Philosophy of Journalism Statement.
I believe they learn best when they are given a framework or overview and then enabled to specialise in areas that most interest them.
I believe being clear about expectations, learning goals and assessment criteria help students to feel safe in their explorations.
I believe talking about learning processes as well as course content encourages students to be reflective learners.
I believe that learning occurs through groups and individuals building associations, exploring patterns and making meanings.
