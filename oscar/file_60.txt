Personal Assets – Getting a traditional loan for a franchise can be difficult. The more personal resources you can bring to the table, such as retirement funds and personal savings, the easier it will be to buy a franchise. If you’re planning to get a bank loan or an SBA loan, then you at a minimum need a 10-20% down payment and some collateral (if the franchise involves the purchase of real estate, that can be used as collateral).
Part of the reason we spent a full day researching and figuring out location has to do with what it will cost you to start. If you’re working from home and not seeing clients, you may find your startup costs are limited to marketing, stationery, any supplies, and legal. If not, you’re going to need enough to set aside for at least the first months rent and utilities of the new space, including all the amenities to outfit your new office.
Able Lending will manage and administer your process of raising 100% of your needed funds from friends and family. They make it easy for you to look professional, be charged your agreed upon interest rate with each individual investor, and they make sure everyone gets paid on time. They do all of this for a single origination fee of 1-3% at the time of funding.
Using a stock loan (securities-based financing) allows a potential franchisee to leverage the value of their stocks without giving up ownership of the stocks. Securities based financing allows potential small business owners to get fast, affordable funding, while also having the ability to keep all the upside of keeping their stocks (dividends and stock price growth). Funding usually comes in the form of a line of credit backed by the stocks’ value.
4. Set up and claim your business online. Whether you get on board or not, information about your business is and will be on the internet. Wouldn’t you rather proactively control what people read or see about your business when they Google it? Do a search on different browsers to see what information you see about your company and then claim or create a listing for your business.
Your eligibility. Each franchisor has its own set of requirements for you to meet, and from there you’ll need to meet the criteria any lenders have. Confirm eligibility with the providers you’re interested in to see whether you meet their minimum standards. If not, you have the option of learning what you can change to make the cut. And keep exploring your other providers.

Being that each franchise launch means the business doesn’t have existing/trailing revenue, opening a franchise business is essentially opening a startup business. As with startups, the small business lending options are limited — but available. Other franchises are existing entities and are looking for capital to help with operating expenses and other working capital options. Here are the main options:
If you start your company with co-founders, you should agree early on about the details of your business relationship. Not doing so can potentially cause significant legal problems down the road (a good example of this is the infamous Zuckerberg/Winklevoss Facebook litigation). In a way, think of the founder agreement as a form of “pre-nuptial agreement.” Here are the key deal terms your written founder agreement needs to address:
Stock Option Plans are an extremely popular method of attracting, motivating, and retaining the best employees, especially when the company is unable to pay high salaries. A Stock Option Plan gives the company the flexibility to award stock options to employees, officers, directors, advisors, and consultants, allowing these people to buy stock in the company when they exercise the option.
Although you’ll often need to make a specific financial commitment and meet certain regulations to open a franchise, there’s a lot you get in return. You’ll get the built-in name recognition that brings customers in, as well as guidance on everything from hiring to keeping local regulators happy. Before you get started, there are a few important things to know.
Getting money in advance of doing any business is called “mobilization capital.” This means you are looking for capital to help start a business and don’t have customers yet. This is also known as unsecured lending and is typically very difficult to secure. Your best bet in these situations is to try and raise seed capital investment aka friends and family investors. If your hot idea is really as good as you think, you should be able to find friends to join up and start up a company.
In most cases, maintaining a good business credit report is enough to qualify. In addition, it instills confidence not only in the lender, but also in you. There is at least one SBA office in every state in America. If you contact them regarding the startup status of your business model and plan, you can get started on a government small business loan that will give you the financing to make your dreams a reality.

Satellite altimetry is a technique that uses orbiting spacecraft to make very accurate measurements of the height of Earth's land, ice and ocean. Jason-3 carries a radar altimeter system specially designed to make extremely accurate and precise measurements of the height and waves of the ocean surface. Each second, the Jason-3 altimeter bounces thousands of radar pulses off of the sea surface, while a radiometer measures how the radar waves are slowed by the atmosphere and three additional instruments help measure the satellite's precise orbit.

Former US envoy to Serbia says Belgrade and Pristina should learn to work with each other | N1 Srbija
Former US ambassador to Serbia, now the CEO & President of The EastWest Institute, told N1 on Thursday that the best solution for both Belgrade and Pristina would be their mutual recognition, adding he was surprised with Serbia’s authorities reaction to current Washington envoy’s statement that for his country Kosovo was an independent state.
Kyle Scott said on Tuesday that Kosovo was not the so-called state, but the recognised country, provoking fierce reactions by some Belgrade officials.
"As ambassador Scott said, it is nothing new. That’s the US stand about a real state, as Serbia is a real state,” Cameron Phelps Munter, who served as the US envoy in Serbia during Kosovo’s declaration on independence in 2008.
"The best solution is that independent Kosovo and independent Serbia learn to work with each other,” he told N1.

HD bikini Sex Tube We love eighteen year old playgirl with nifty juggs and ass is taking off her bikini on a poolside That Babe demonstrates
Fancy having loads of steamy hot chicks getting fucked senseless in their bikinis? Wonder no more, for with our hot bikini tubes, the wild delights here
I don't have fancy pictures, 20,000 followers or companies sponsoring me. Add to that, EVERY other person you meet is a blogger and may I say competition is alive; and I for one am not competitive in that way.
I love my home and want to create a "welcome home" for my friends and family; that was the basis of starting my blog.
As I began to contemplate (spurred on by my daughter) returning to blogging I knew I needed to focus. I had so many thoughts running through my head, I would start one only to delete it and start another. The more I thought about that the more I realized I need to focus in so many areas of my life. I'm sure you can relate . . . standing at the kitchen sink, the buzzer for the dryer goes off. You head toward the dryer but see your husband's shoes so you pick them up and take them to the bedroom. In the bedroom the bed needs to be made so you do that and by the end of the day you are exhausted and not really sure why.
Several years ago I gave up making "resolutions" and instead chose a guiding word for the coming year. I've had several; Simplicity, Intentional and this year I decided to be the year of
I need to focus on growing my relationship with my husband by being attentive to him and listening when he speaks; not checking Facebook, Pinterest, bHome and Instagram on my phone while he rattles on in the background.
I need to focus on my (remaining at home) daughter. She turns 18 in February; time with her at home is quickly running out.
I need to focus on creating a "welcome home" by setting aside time each day to complete home caring tasks so my home is ready at the knock on the door to welcome any and all inside.
I need to focus on what's for dinner ~ earlier than 4:30 in the afternoon; because hungry people will be coming through the front door and it's my responsibility to feed them.
Hooray!!!!! I am so proud of you. Focus is an amazing guiding word, and I know that with the Lord as the forefront of everything you do, things in your life will also come into focus ; ) Love you!!
1. Energy Source or Illumination (A) - the first requirement for remote sensing is to have an energy source which illuminates or provides electromagnetic energy to the target of interest.
2. Radiation and the Atmosphere (B) - as the energy travels from its source to the target, it will come in contact with and interact with the atmosphere it passes through. This interaction may take place a second time as the energy travels from the target to the sensor.
3. Interaction with the Target (C) - once the energy makes its way to the target through the atmosphere, it interacts with the target depending on the properties of both the target and the radiation.
4. Recording of Energy by the Sensor (D) - after the energy has been scattered by, or emitted from the target, we require a sensor (remote - not in contact with the target) to collect and record the electromagnetic radiation.
5. Transmission, Reception, and Processing (E) - the energy recorded by the sensor has to be transmitted, often in electronic form, to a receiving and processing station where the data are processed into an image (hardcopy and/or digital).
6. Interpretation and Analysis (F) - the processed image is interpreted, visually and/or digitally or electronically, to extract information about the target which was illuminated.

There’s nothing streaky about these beautiful pastels. They are on the thin side, so I found 3 thin coats worked best. Each shade self leveled easily.

Below are the Lakur Spring polishes in action.

I hear that Spring is on its way, though we still have an awful lot of snow here in New England, and more to come this weekend. I know I’m not the only one longing for warm Spring days, being able to take a walk without hiking through 5 feet of snow, and cute spring outfits!
I thought it was a good time to switch purses, and update it for the upcoming season. I love the shade of this cheerful blurple (blue-purple) bag! It’s basically a neutral, right?! I do love my bright bags!! Here are a few of my must-have items that I am never without!
protection from evil – the horrid monthly evil visitor that is. Mine always comes unexpectedly. Always. And never when I’m home bumming around in yoga pants. I always keep a stash of UbyKotex Ultra Thin Pads in my bag just incase! Look how cute the packaging is! It’s not even obvious what they are! Click for FREE samples!
lipgloss and lipstick – I usually have about 58 tubes rolling around in my purse, but since I just switched there’s only a few. I typically reach for lippies that I can apply quickly in the car, sometimes without a mirror! A few of my go-to staples are Bite Beauty’s BB for lips in Tawny, IT Cosmetics CC+ Blurred Lines in Love, and Tarte’s LipSurgence lipsgloss.
Notice there are no warm scarves, gloves, mittens or hats in my Spring purse. I’m thinking positively! What’s in your purse?

The mani above is with Sweet Spring and One In A Melon. I am really liking these vibrant spring shades! The only disappointment of the bunch is the yellow shade. It was a runny, streaky mess. The FingerPaints Picnic In The Park collection will be available at Sally Beauty in March and April. Do you think you’ll be picking up anything from this collection?
I have pics and swatches of a few of Tarte’s Spring offerings to share today! Celebrated is the newest Amazonian Clay 12 hour Blush, while it’s said to be a warm pink nude, it definitely looks peachy on my skin. I suppose it’s a pinky-peach, and it’s beautiful and very wearable! The packaging is a little different, as this is part of the 15 year Tarte anniversary release. It lasts all day, and performs well like the rest of the Amazonian Clay blushes. Also in new packaging is the Amazonian Butter Lipstick in Ethereal Pink. This gorgeous peachy pink shimmer is LE, so grab it while you can. The moisturizing formula is wonderful, and this shade will look beautiful on a variety of skin tones! Glitzy LipSurgence lip tint is a neutral peach, filled with lots of gold shimmer. It’s not a color I would have been drawn to, but I’m glad I received it. It’s really pretty for layering! I actually love the look of it over The Ethereal Pink butter lipstick.
If you love the Maracuja oil and eye cream like I do, the new Neck Treatment might be right up your alley. Meant for the delicate thin skin on the neck and decolette, this intense hydrator will encourage skin cells to regenerate over time, and promote elasticity, while decreasing wrinkles and fine lines.
You probably know about my obsession for ALL of the LipSurgence glosses by now. The new Skintuitive Lip Gloss and Lip Tint goes on clear and adjusts to your own personal perfect pink shade. These are some of my favorite lip products, hands down.
I don’t have the Tartelette eyeshadow palette, but I’ve hear nothing but rave reviews if you love Tarte’s matte shadows. Do you have anything from Tarte’s Spring line up? Anything interest you?

The last reference to Husband on the Pickering Town Council website was removed today. Remarkably he was still showing as Town Clerk. His deputy is now described as Acting Town Clerk.
I'm guessing it's perfectly possible that Pickering Town Council either genuinely didn't realise that their Andrew Husband was also James Andrew Husband of York, the Accused, or else that some of the town councillors (and Rotarians) did know of the charges but had been convinced by Husband himself that it was all nonsense and a complete fabrication, as would in due course be revealed in court. He himself may even have believed that he could never be found guilty, because as far as he could see it was only a case of one person's word against another's. Evidently he reckoned without the highly emotive 'beard rash' thing and the taint of his having supposedly been a close associate of the monstrous Dobbie.
What with the innocent until proven guilty concept, the most the Town Council could've done pre-verdict was to suspend him on full pay whilst awaiting the outcome of the case, which it appears they chose not to do, for whatever reason. As aforesaid, his employers may not even have known that he was THE James Andrew Husband until very recently. Not everyone is as bright as a button, after all, and presumably the Andrew Husband they knew was the sort of decent, upright citizen who could never in a million years have committed the type of offences he was accused of.
You are right that they could only suspend him on full pay, unless his contract of employment specifically allowed them to suspend him without pay.
Husband will have tried to ride the storm. He didn't appreciate that the allegations (now found proven) had been in the wind for 25 years and he could give no reason why they were being falsely made.
It is possible that the last reference to him on the council website may have been removed yesterday because he has done the decent thing and resigned.
It occurs to me that the reason Husband wasn't suspended on full pay may simply have been that town councils are shoestring operations these days and Pickering Town Council simply couldn't afford to pay wages to a replacement town clerk whilst continuing to pay Husband's presumably meagre stipend. If the job doesn't involve contact with minors and vulnerable adults, Husband wouldn't have been seen as posing any sort of hypothetical threat to anyone.
You are right Spoony that Pickering Council runs on a shoestring. The budget is not a lot and Husband topped hi salary up by auditing the accounts for other local parish councils for abut £80-£100 a shot.
This is from the minutes of a council meeting in January 2018. Note that the bank account signatories were 2 councillors and the assistant town clerk.
Looking at what the council is responsible for (street lights, play areas and dog bins) it's kind of hard to see why being Town Clerk would be any more than a 2 day a week job.
If this wasn't such a serious subject, I would now be typing a cynical and not very PC comment worthy of 'Mock the Week', or 'Have I got.....'
IF that was a complete extract of the relevent bits, as a banker (retired) I would not be satisfied. The minutes should state the number of people to sign and if there are specific controls (ie a Councillor plus authorised person or whether two councillors can sign or limits on amounts - as examples).
For prevention of fraud it should also name the persons required to open the new account(s) who would not necessarily include the day-to-day signatories (it would be easy for Joe Snooks and Freda Fuzmaculander to simply walk in to the bank and claim to be council officers - I have heard of that happening in respect of major companies and also (beleive it or not) Mr In Land Revenue!
‘So, still happy you voted for my namesake who took away your health insurance, raised your taxes and should turn out to be a mental patient?’
Apparently he had some glowing testimonials from his work colleagues, which must be from the council.
My husband was a Rotarian for many years. In the U.K. The Paul Harris Award is not given lightly. If I recall correctly, the Rotary Club has to give Rotary's own Foundation US$1000 before it can nominate somebody they consider outstanding to receive the award. The fact that Pickering Rotary Club gave him such an award means they did think highly of him, at the time.

Digitisation of the Drawings Collection has been made possible through the generosity of the Leon Levy Foundation
Sir John Soane's collection includes some 30,000 architectural, design and topographical drawings which is a very important resource for scholars worldwide. His was the first architect’s collection to attempt to preserve the best in design for the architectural profession in the future, and it did so by assembling as exemplars surviving drawings by great Renaissance masters and by the leading architects in Britain in the 17th and 18th centuries and his near contemporaries such as Sir William Chambers, Robert Adam and George Dance the Younger. These drawings sit side by side with 9,000 drawings in Soane’s own hand or those of the pupils in his office, covering his early work as a student, his time in Italy and the drawings produced in the course of his architectural practice from 1780 until the 1830s.
Browse (via the vertical menu to the left) and search results for Drawings include a mixture of Concise catalogue records – drawn from an outline list of the collection – and fuller records where drawings have been catalogued in more detail (an ongoing process).

If you nominate yourself as a "Specialist"; "Non-Specialist" or "Educational" user then the appropriate filter will be employed for you so that only the most relevant pages are shown. You can, of course, always return to the Home Page and choose to access the whole site if you change your mind.
Texts and Films are largely of secondary importance on the site. The exception to this is MS B as a searchable Reading Text allowing thematic searches. See below.
If you click on an individual manuscript you should first see a series of small "thumbnail" images on the screen. These are photographic representations of the entire manuscript.
You can move the cursor up and down either the page or the photograph and the corresponding line on either the photograph or the page will be highlighted. Because of the limitations of the pilot (in terms of time and money) only the text of MS A has been entered in a fully searchable line-by-line way. However, it is to be hoped that this will be undertaken for all the other MSS in due course.
The site also contains a fully searchable Reading Text of MS B for which a wide range of search themes have been entered. This allows the user to search for a number of key ideas and images in the text as well as a limited number of poetic effects. Again, it has the potential for future enlargement.

The study of the interaction of bubbles with shock waves and ultrasound is sometimes termed ‘acoustic cavitation'. It is of importance in many biomedical applications where sound waves are applied. The use of shock waves and ultrasound in medical treatments is appealing because of their non-invasiveness. In this review, we present a variety of acoustics–bubble interactions, with a focus on shock wave–bubble interaction and bubble cloud phenomena. The dynamics of a single spherically oscillating bubble is rather well understood. However, when there is a nearby surface, the bubble often collapses non-spherically with a high-speed jet. The direction of the jet depends on the ‘resistance' of the boundary: the bubble jets towards a rigid boundary, splits up near an elastic boundary, and jets away from a free surface. The presence of a shock wave complicates the bubble dynamics further. We shall discuss both experimental studies using high-speed photography and numerical simulations involving shock wave–bubble interaction. In biomedical applications, instead of a single bubble, often clouds of bubbles appear (consisting of many individual bubbles). The dynamics of such a bubble cloud is even more complex. We shall show some of the phenomena observed in a high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) field. The nonlinear nature of the sound field and the complex inter-bubble interaction in a cloud present challenges to a comprehensive understanding of the physics of the bubble cloud in HIFU. We conclude the article with some comments on the challenges ahead.
Cavitation bubbles appear ‘naturally’ in the human body when our joints crack. It is proposed that the ‘fluid cavitation is responsible for the cracking noise’ [1]. The cavitation bubbles in our bodily liquids are generated from the dissolved gas in the liquid. As noted by the ‘father’ of microscopy, Anthoni van Leeuwenhoek (paraphrasing in English), ‘…a large quantity of bubbles came out of the water, rose, and even more appeared when I gently tapped on the glass…’ when he described the use of an ‘air-pump’ to study the presence of air in water and blood [2]. When there is an external excitation, such as a shock wave or an ultrasound field, cavitation bubbles are nucleated from gas pockets in the liquid. In most cases, these bubbles also contain water vapour.
Cavitation bubbles are not stationary. They oscillate (usually strongly) in volume. They are found ubiquitously on moving ship propellers, underwater explosions and in shock wave lithotripsy treatment for the disintegration of kidney stones. A schematic of the spherical oscillation of a cavitation ‘explosion’ bubble is shown in figure 1. The radius–time curve shows the variation of the radius of the bubble in time as it oscillates (figure 1a). The bubble expands (from 1 to 3) because of a high initial internal pressure, and reaches a maximum size at 4. It then collapses (from 5 to 7) to a minimum volume (figure 1b). This bubble behaviour is strongly nonlinear, i.e. the bubble spends much more time near its maximum size than near its minimum size. The interested reader can refer to the basic spherical bubble dynamics theory in appendix A.
(a) Radius–time curve of an oscillating bubble. (b) The corresponding bubble shapes at different times (indicated with 1–7) of its oscillation cycle. The pressure inside the bubble is high at instants 1 and 7. The pressure is low (close to vapour pressure, a few thousand pascal) between 2 and 6. After its collapse at 7, the bubble can rebound, and may exhibit one or more oscillation cycles.
The bubble dynamics change when there is a nearby boundary. In particular, the loss of spherical symmetry can result in the formation of high-speed liquid jets traversing the bubble. A typical example is given in figure 2, which shows the non-spherical collapse of a bubble near a rigid plate. Initially, the bubble expands almost spherically (figure 2a). The top side of the bubble near the plate is flattened as the bubble approaches its maximum size (the last three outermost curves in figure 2a). From its maximum size (outermost curve in figure 2b), the bubble collapses. As the bubble shrinks, it moves towards the plate, and develops a jet which transverses the bubble (inner eight curves in figure 2b). The jet then impacts on the top bubble wall and eventually on the plate. The speed of this water jet is very high, usually around 100 m s−1, and is independent of the bubble size. Figure 2c shows an experimental observation of the same bubble collapse. The bubble is at its maximum size in the first frame on the left. It then collapses and moves towards the plate on top. The last frame shows the bubble at its minimum size at the plate (probably with a jet).

The bubble expands from the innermost circle to the outermost circle. (b) Collapse phase of the bubble. It collapses from the outermost circle to the innermost curve where a jet has developed towards the rigid boundary. The bubble moves towards the plate as it collapses. (c) Experimental observation of the collapse of a cavitation bubble. It was initiated with an electrical discharge about 5 mm away from the solid surface. The first frame shows the bubble at its maximum radius of about 4.5 mm. It shrinks and moves towards the boundary in the second frame. Finally, the bubble collapses, presumably while forming a jet towards the surface (last frame). The collapse time is about 0.6 ms.
The jet in a collapsing bubble could also be observed when a shock wave moves across a stationary or a cavitation bubble. This jet develops in the direction of the travelling wave. The jet speed in this case is often supersonic (a few km s−1). The physics involved in the bubble–shockwave interaction can be rather complex (especially with regard to reflection of shock waves, both outside the bubble and internally), but the jet speed will be analysed in greater detail in §2.
Another similarly complex phenomenon is the bubble dynamics in a strong ultrasound field. When a HIFU transducer is placed near or in a water tank, bubble clouds are generated in the water. These clouds move, expand and collapse in the sound field. They are driven by acoustic radiation forces (Bjerknes forces [3,4]). It is possible that similar structures appear in the human body during treatment with HIFU.
HIFU is already clinically used for the treatment of prostate cancer, uterine fibroids and bone metastasis. It has also been tested for treating other tumours such as kidney, liver, pancreatic and bladder tumours. HIFU is currently being tested for treating essential tremor and Alzheimer's disease. Most clinical HIFU equipment uses high frequency (in megahertz) at low intensity. The main advantage of HIFU in medical treatment is its non-invasiveness. Treatment can be administered extracorporeally without surgery. Also the treatment area can be highly selective as HIFU has potentially a focal region of a few millimetres in length [5]. The bubble generated by HIFU at the focal region could also be used for imaging during the treatment. This is because the bubble (with its air core) has different acoustic impedance from its surrounding tissues.
As a side note, a special type of bubble, known as an ultrasound contrast agent (UCA), has been developed for imaging purposes. These bubbles have a shell (made of lipid or polymers) and a gas core (air or a heavy gas such as octafluoropropane). The shell prevents the bubble from dissolving, and the gas core provides the acoustic impedance required for the imaging. Apart from imaging, UCA is applied in other research areas such as targeted drug delivery. Drug-loaded UCAs are transported to the tumour site, and ultrasound or a shock wave is applied to excite the UCA for the delivery of the drug. Interested readers are referred to recent reviews on UCA [6,7]. A clear distinction should be made, however, between endogenous cavitation nuclei, which we study in the rest of this article, and artificially introduced nuclei, such as the UCA.
Another method of targeted drug delivery still under research is the use of acoustics to vaporize a droplet which could block blood flow to a tumour or deliver lethal drugs to cancer cells [8]. Many other interesting topics are undoubtedly worth mentioning, but, due to length constraints, this review will not be exhaustive. This paper is organized in the following manner: we begin with the subject that is most well understood, namely bubble–shockwave interaction (§2). In §3, some of the intriguing phenomena observed in HIFU are shown and discussed. Section 4 deals with some comments and thoughts on the challenges ahead, followed by conclusions in §5.
A shock wave is basically a very large localized pressure perturbation, as shown in figure 3. It travels with a velocity slightly greater than the speed of sound (approx. 1500 m s−1). The most common use of such a shock wave is in lithotripsy, the disintegration of kidney stones. Once such a shock wave hits a bubble, it is found that a jet is generated in the same direction as the travel direction of the shock wave.
Example of a typical shock wave as used in several medical applications; shock wave pressure as a function of time. The pressure first briefly attains a very high value (approx. 40 MPa), then it becomes very low (approx. −8 MPa). Water can sustain such a negative pressure only for a very short time. The positive part of the shock wave has a time duration of approximately 1 µs, and, as the shock speed is approximately 1500 m s−1, the spatial extent is about 1.5 mm.
Field and co-workers [9–12] conducted many experiments studying this interaction in the late 1980s and 1990s. In their experiments, the shock wave was generated by an impact striker which generated a shock pressure in the gigapascal range. The gas bubbles were trapped in a two-dimensional gelatin gel. The gel liquefied as soon as the shock wave went through it. The observation of the shock was done using Schlieren shadowgraphs combined with high-speed photography. It was observed that the shock wave induced the collapse of the gas bubbles with accompanying high-speed jets (a few hundred metres per second) in the direction of the travelling shock wave, as seen in figure 4. They also studied the shock wave impacting on several bubbles arranged in a row or an array (a primitive ‘bubble cloud’). In certain cases, a shielding effect of the outer bubbles on the inner bubbles in an array was observed [10] (for more discussion on shielding effects in bubble clouds see §3.2). It must be kept in mind, though, that these are essentially static ‘holes’ instead of bubbles generated with a laser, spark or by ultrasonic means. Nevertheless, these experiments are important from a historical point of view.
Early experiment on shock wave–bubble interaction. A cavity with initial radius 1.5 mm in a gelatin block is collapsed by a shock wave travelling from left to right at six different time instants. The bubble does not collapse spherically, but instead a high-speed jet of 400 m s−1 is observed going in the same direction as the shock wave. The time between two frames is about 2 µs.

In Japan, Tomita et al. [13] investigated the collapse of multiple gas bubbles on a boundary by a shock wave. They placed two air bubbles on a gelatin block. The bubbles interacted with a travelling shock generated by an explosive. The bubbles collapsed by jetting into the gelatin. They found that, beyond a critical separation, the bubbles collapsed without influencing each other. Another group at Tohoko University studied the interaction of gas bubbles with shock waves generated by an explosive [14]. They found that, if the bubbles were close enough to each other, the direction of their jets during collapse was influenced by the adjacent bubble in such a way that the jets did not follow the direction of travel of the shock waves, but slanted towards the centre of the two bubbles. The group also studied the interaction of shock waves with a bubble on different surfaces (aluminium foil, gelatin, rat liver and rat abdominal aorta) [15]. High-speed photography was used to observe the bubble collapse after its interaction with a shock wave generated by the explosion of a silver azide pellet. The bubble on the aluminium foil was found to jet through the foil as it collapsed (figure 5a). On the other surfaces, the authors observed bubble migration and oscillation after the shock wave travelled through. Eventually the bubble collapsed, and penetrated into the surfaces (figure 5b). They also analysed the tissue damage caused by the collapsing bubble.
The collapse of a bubble attached to (a) an aluminium foil and (b) a gelatin surface. The pressure applied was about 10 MPa, and the inter-frame time is 10 µs. In (a), the equivalent bubble radius is 0.59 mm. The thickness of the foil is 15 µm. The bubble penetrates the foil, and re-expands behind it. In (b), the equivalent bubble radius is 0.61 mm. It is seen that the bubble collapses with a jet into the gelatin. (Reproduced with permission from [15].)
The interest in bubble shock wave interaction grew with the recognition of the crucial role of bubbles in extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). It was understood that the collapse of the bubbles induced by the shock waves causes the formation of microjets, which impinge on the renal stones and facilitate their disintegration [16]. Coleman et al. [17] reported that the jets from the collapse of cavitation bubbles generated by an extracorporeal shock wave lithotripter were violent enough to puncture thin foils and to deform metal plates. In Germany, the research group led by Lauterborn studied the interaction of lithotripter-generated shock waves with air bubbles [18]. They placed a small bubble (between 0.1 and 0.9 mm in radius) on a thin plastic foil. As the shock travelled through the bubble, it collapsed and penetrated the foil with a high-speed jet (between 400 and 800 m s−1). Ohl & Ikink [19] imaged the jetting of micrometre-sized gas bubbles interacting with a lithotripter shock wave. From their observation, the small bubbles (generated by pulsed electrolysis) collapse with micrometre-sized jets in the travel direction of the shock waves, as seen in figure 6. They postulated that the mechanism could be potentially exploited for drug or gene delivery into cells.
Four bubbles 0.3 ms before the arrival of the shock wave (a), and 1.5 µs after the shock wave has travelled from the bottom of the frame (b). The frame width is 250 µm. The left to right arrows depict the centre of translation and the other arrows show the remaining bubbles after the jet penetration. Note that each bubble has moved upwards. The top bubble still clearly exhibits the entry of a jet in the upwards direction. The three other bubbles show remnants of these jets in the form of even smaller bubbles. These have probably split off from the main bubble. (Reproduced with permission from [19].)
At Duke University, Sankin et al. [20] studied the lithotripter shock wave interaction with an oscillating bubble generated by a laser. They found that, if the shock wave reached the oscillating bubble during its collapse phase, the resultant collapse was more intense (larger shape deformation and jet velocity) than if the shock wave reached the bubble at its expansion phase. They further extended the study to include an elastic boundary on which the gas bubble was attached [21]. They confirmed that the maximum jet penetration was achieved when the shock wave arrived during the bubble collapse phase. They suggested that this phenomenon could be exploited for targeted drug delivery and gene transfection.
Shock wave–bubble interaction was also studied using laser-generated shock waves. Kodama & Tomita [22] reported that the shock wave generated by a collapsing laser-bubble caused an air bubble attached to a gelatin gel to collapse with a strong jet which penetrated the gelatin. Many other studies involving the use of laser bubbles include the investigation of shock waves emitted by a single bubble [23,24], the interaction of two laser bubbles [25,26], the collapse of a laser-generated bubble near a rigid boundary [27,28], an elastic boundary [29,30] and a free surface [31,32].
There are a number of interesting simulation studies that are worth mentioning. An early work by Church [33] modelled the bubble by the Gilmore–Akulichev formulation (essentially an extension of the Rayleigh–Plesset formulation for spherical bubbles in appendix A). The ESWL wave was considered as a pressure wave that changed in time. Very high pressure (up to 10 MPa) was considered. Some 10 years later, Zhu & Zhong [34] also used the Gilmore formulation to calculate the bubble response when it interacted with an ESWL field. They considered three different pressure profiles as generated by different lithotripters. The main drawback of these models is that they can only be applied to spherical bubbles, while all the above experiments clearly show deviation of sphericity in the form of jets in the shock wave direction.
A more advanced model and simulation technique was developed at the University of Southampton, UK [35–37], in this century. A numerical simulation code based on the free-Lagrange formulation to solve the Euler equations was developed. The travelling shock and the bubble collapse are captured by the mesh which changes its connectivity as the bubble deforms. The group first developed a two-dimensional version, and then extended it to an axial symmetrical version. Their results showed the reflection of shock waves inside the bubbles, and dynamic stress loading on nearby solid materials. In [37], the authors validated their code by comparing with an arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) simulation reported in Ding & Gracewski [38], who used the ALE method to solve the Euler equations for the simulation of a shock wave interaction with an air bubble. Both weak (less than 30 MPa in peak pressure) and strong (up to 2 GPa in peak pressure) shocks were investigated. They noted that, for weak shocks, the bubble remains quasi-spherical, while for strong shocks a jet appears in the bubble. The shock was modelled as a step pressure (as compared with an ESWL shock wave profile, as in figure 3). A bubble of initial radius 1.0 mm collapsed with a high-speed jet (2200 m s−1) in the travel direction of the shock wave. However, full domain simulations such as those above are computationally very expensive, especially if they are being extended to full three-dimensional simulations (for example, to model the interaction of two or more bubbles with a shock wave [39]).
In Singapore, an active group of people is involved in bubble dynamics studies, which essentially started as a spin-off from underwater explosion-related work [40] in which the prediction of jets in collapsing bubbles is essential. Klaseboer et al. [41,42] attempted to simulate the bubble–shock wave interaction using the boundary element method (BEM), where only the surface of the bubble is meshed as an alternative to the above-mentioned numerical methods. A typical simulation is shown in figure 7, where the shock wave is modelled as a travelling step pressure. In [41], the code was validated by comparing with the simulation results from previous papers [36,38]. It was found that the BEM code successfully captured the bubble deformation and collapse. The high-speed jet upon bubble surface impact (2000 m s−1 by BEM) was comparable to the previous reported values (2200 m s−1 for ALE and 2250 m s−1 for free-Lagrange). However, in BEM, the model is based on potential flow. There was no travelling or reflected shock wave inside the bubble. Nevertheless, the simulation captured most of the bubble dynamics because the phenomenon of bubble shock wave interaction is governed by inertia (potential flow can predict the jet and its speed accurately). Klaseboer et al. [42] modified their model to include a lithotripter shock wave and compared the results with experimental observations [20]. They reported good agreement between the collapse times of the bubbles and the pressure peaks measured (water hammer pressure in the simulation). They concluded that the BEM model is capable of predicting jet shape and velocity (as well as other parameters) during bubble collapse after interacting with a shock wave. The biggest advantage of the model is that it is computationally very efficient.
Simulation result of the interaction of a pressure pulse of 0.528 GPa (modelled as a step function, i.e. the pressure is atmospheric in front of the shock-front and 0.528 GPa behind it) with a bubble of radius R0=1.0 mm. Five time instants are shown with the time interval between each frame 0.44 µs. The vertical line moving across the bubble represents the advancing shock front. Also indicated are velocity vector plots. Each frame is surrounded with a rectangle of 4.0 × 4.0 mm (the computational domain is infinite). The left-hand-side bubble surface accelerates first to form a jet, which attains a maximum velocity of around 2 km s−1 upon impact. The simulation was performed with a BEM. More results can be found in [42]. This case was also analysed by Ding & Gracewski [39] using a finite volume method and gave virtually identical results.
A group at the University of California, Berkeley, used a boundary integral method code to study the interaction of shockwave and bubble near rigid surfaces [43,44]. They considered the reflection and interface of the shock wave at the rigid boundary. They found that the reflection of the shock wave at the wall affected the bubble collapse. Constructive interference of the waves enhanced the expansion and subsequent collapse of the bubble. On the other hand, destructive interference suppressed the bubble collapse. Also in California, Johnsen & Colonius [45,46] developed a high-order quasi-conservative scheme to solve the Euler equations. Their simulation captured the travelling shock and the highly deformed interface of the bubble. As in the free-Lagrange method, the simulation runs beyond bubble jet impact. They showed the rebound of the collapsed bubble, and the emission and reflection of shock waves during the collapse.
The jetting phenomenon can be analysed in simple terms, from a physics point of view. Our analysis shows that the collapse time and jet speed can be predicted. The theoretical collapse time for a spherical bubble as derived in appendix A is:
2.1 Here ρ is the density of water (1000 kg m−3) and, if pref is taken to be 0.528 GPa, one gets 1.4 µs (with R0 = 1.0 mm). Numerically, a larger value for the collapse time of the bubble of 1.76 µs was obtained for the simulation of figure 7. This can easily be explained by the fact that the jet must traverse slightly more than the bubble radius alone (as the right-hand side of the bubble in figure 7 has not shrunk as much as the left-hand side with the jet). The pressure pulse that was applied in figure 7 was 0.528 GPa. This is a very high pressure and the corresponding shock speed is larger than the speed of sound at 1950 m s−1 [41]. The shock front has travelled a distance of 1950 × 1.75 × 10−6 = 3.4 mm during that time. Similarly, as was the case for a spherical bubble, the jet speed is also independent of the bubble radius and is given by
To summarize, the shock wave essentially acts as a sudden pressure rise, causing the bubble to collapse in a very similar manner to a spherical bubble. But as the pressure rise starts earlier at one side of the bubble, this side collapses first. The other side of the bubble only starts collapsing later (when the shock wave in water has arrived there). This results in a jet travelling in the direction of the shock wave. Note that the case of figure 7 (done with a BEM) uses the same parameters as those in Ding & Gracewski [38] (see their fig. 12). Their finite volume method obtained a collapse time of 1.60 µs and a jet speed of 2.2 km s−1; these values are not far off those obtained with the above theory.
However, for weak shock waves, due care must be taken. For example, Ding & Gracewski [38] (see their fig. 8) took a bubble with R0 = 0.1 mm subjected to a shock wave of 20.5 MPa. The bubble collapsed in 0.75 µs, which is in good agreement with equation (2.1), which gives 0.69 µs. However, no jet was observed in the bubble. This can actually be explained relatively simply, as the shock wave moves over the bubble relatively fast, i.e. the shock wave has travelled a distance of 1500 × 0.69 × 10−6 = 1.1 mm; thus 10 times the bubble radius. This means that the front and back of the bubble feel the shock wave almost at the same instant, resulting in an (almost) spherical bubble collapse.
The interaction of a stationary bubble between two acrylic plates with a spark-generated cavitation bubble. The time in microseconds is given on the right-hand bottom corner of the frame. The spark bubble is initiated 4.8 mm away from the stationary bubble. The stationary bubble has a horizontal radius of 1.65 mm. The spark bubble has a maximum radius of 4.7 mm. The shock wave and flow from the expanding spark bubble causes the stationary bubble to collapse with a jet and break into two bubbles.
Another point worth mentioning is that, if the shock wave is relatively narrow, the bubble does not feel the maximum shock wave pressure during the whole collapse, resulting in larger values for the collapse time than equation (2.1) and lower jet speeds than those of equation (2.2) (as the effective pref is much smaller). The typical shock wave shown in figure 3 has a ‘width’ of about 1.5 mm.
An interesting alternative application of lithotripter technology was recently found [47] by the discovery of ‘particle shooting’ when relatively rough micrometre-sized particles are subjected to the negative part of a shock wave. Rapidly growing cavitation bubbles that form on the surface of such particles cause the particle to accelerate. A microparticle was successfully ‘shot’ into a skin-like jelly material with this method. The technique could be used for non-invasive ultrasonic drug delivery (see [47] for more details). However, the directionality of the shooting particle might be an issue; individual particles are seen to accelerate in random directions, depending on the location of the growing bubble, which could be anywhere on the surface.
More recent work on shockwave–bubble interaction has been carried out in Oxford, UK [48]; a front-tracking method simulated the detailed interactions in three dimensions and complex wave reflections were observed (including after the collapse phase). In a follow-up work, multiple bubbles in an array were simulated [49]. The mechanics of bubble–shockwave interaction can be more complicated when there are multiple bubbles involved. This is because oscillating bubbles emit shock waves during expansion and collapse phases. These shock waves interact with the nearby bubbles, and induce them to collapse with jets in the direction of the travelling shock. Figure 8 shows an example of how a spark-generated bubble induces a jet in a stationary nearby bubble during its expansion. The bubbles are placed in between two acrylic plates and facilitate visualization. When there are hundreds or thousands of bubbles in close proximity, as in a bubble cloud, their interaction with a shock wave (and each other) is still a challenge to observe or model.
In conclusion, we presented a summary of previous and recent studies involving the interaction of a shock wave with a single or several bubbles. It is understood that the phenomena, up to the jet impact, are primarily inertially governed [41,42]. The same might not be so for a bubble or bubble cloud in an ultrasound or HIFU field. The main differences between an ultrasonic field and a shock wave are such that the amplitude of the ultrasound is much lower (only a few bars), and ultrasound is applied in waves (either continuous or in wave-trains). In comparison, a shock wave often has a pressure of a few hundred or thousand bars, and has a pulse-like pressure profile. In the next section, we will investigate the interaction of a bubble with a HIFU field. We will show some interesting experimental observations.
The first use of HIFU can be traced back to the late 1930s [50] with the invention of focused ultrasound and its first biological application in the early 1940s by Lynn et al. [51] in which ‘focused ultrasound could be applied in any selected direction, to a predetermined depth, in the tissues of living animals’. The underlying physics of HIFU is usually explained as ‘conversion of mechanical energy into heat, and through inertial cavitation’ [52], where the cavitation consists of rapidly collapsing bubbles. Several applications have been developed [53,54], and research on the use of HIFU is still ongoing [55]. However, the physics and exact mechanisms involved are not yet well understood. First of all, the nucleation process is still much of a mystery (especially in human tissues). But also, the interplay of the thousands of bubbles that usually occur in HIFU, the creation of bubble clouds and their movement is not clear. Therefore, instead of investigating a many-bubble system, we will firstly concentrate on a single bubble interacting with a sound wave. This will highlight some of the phenomena involved.
Our HIFU experimental set-up is shown in figure 9. The HIFU is generated by a bowl-shaped piezo electric transducer. It is supported by a holder and has been waterproofed. It has a resonant frequency of 250 kHz. The transducer is submerged in a water tank of approximately 300 mm3. It is driven by an amplifier to which a signal generator is connected.
Experimental set-up of the HIFU system. A bowl-shaped piezo-electric transducer (diameter 60 mm) is placed at the centre of a water tank (approx. 300 mm3). The transducer is driven by a class A amplifier which is connected to a signal generator. The observations are recorded using a high-speed photography system.
When a bubble is placed in a weak low-frequency ultrasound field generated by the HIFU set-up in figure 9, it does not stay spherical but instead starts to undergo shape oscillations. An example is shown in figure 10. The bubble of radius 0.3 mm is created by electrolysis at the tip of an electric wire. Then an ultrasound field of 15 kHz is applied from below. The images are captured by a high-speed camera with 150 000 frames s−1. The bubble starts to oscillate after a short delay of about 40 frames (approx. 267 µs). The oscillation period is about 20 frames (approx. 133 ms), thus the oscillation frequency is approximately 7500 Hz. This is half that of the driving frequency of the ultrasound (15 kHz). Note that 15 kHz can hardly be called ultrasound. This frequency is chosen such that the phenomena can be recorded with a high-speed camera (this frequency is achieved by exciting the transducer in the radial vibration mode, instead of the transverse mode). Similar phenomena are also highly likely to occur for higher frequencies. The change in the shape of the bubble could be described in terms of a perturbation of summed spherical harmonics superimposed on a sphere [56]. As in the case of a bubble there is an axis of symmetry, the plots of spherical harmonics are divided into zones of alternating signs as seen in figure 11.
A bubble with radius 0.3 mm (generated through electrolysis) is suddenly subjected to an ultrasonic field of 15 kHz. The time period between each frame is 6.67 µs. Shape oscillations are observed. The ultrasound is started at frame ‘1' (not shown); at frame ‘46' the first oscillation become visible.
Shape oscillations as described by summed spherical harmonics. The amplitude is small, and the order is 6 throughout the sequence in figure 10. The time in microseconds is shown in the left-hand corner. The corresponding frame numbers (in increasing time) are 45, 54, 62, 72, 76 and 86.
The top row in figure 11 shows the initial order 6 (n = 6) oscillation of the bubble after it has been hit by the travelling ultrasound. The positive and negative zones of order 6 oscillation are shown in the first and second drawing on the right, respectively. In the second row, the oscillation amplitude increases. Both positive and negative zones display shapes with more pronounced corners. In the last row, the oscillation amplitude is reduced slightly from row 2. The order of shape oscillation remains 6 throughout the experiment.
A feature that should be mentioned with regard to the interaction of a single bubble and a sound wave is the Bjerknes force [57]. This force can not only accelerate a bubble in a sound field to considerable speeds but also keep a bubble trapped in the node or antinode of a sound field. More effects related to the Bjerknes force will be shown in §3.2.
At high driving voltage, a HIFU transducer in water produces a high pressure at its focal point which in turn generates bubble clouds. The dynamics of these bubble clouds is a major challenge from a modelling point of view [58]. The sound field is nonlinear (i.e. the amplitude of the sound wave is so large that the linearization of the fluid dynamics equations is no longer valid), and the bubbles undergo complex interactions such as collision and coalescence. Nevertheless, there is still a strong motivation to understand the acoustic bubble clouds as they are perhaps responsible for the mechanisms behind the success of the use of HIFU for medical treatment.
A similar set-up as depicted in the previous section has been used here. When the transducer is driven strongly (387 Vpp), streams of bubbles are observed to form above the transducer (figure 12). The bubbles in the streams are small, and the largest bubbles have radii of about 60 µm. It is noted that these bubbles are smaller than the resonant bubble size (Rres = 150 µm) (see appendix A for discussion on resonant frequency). They seem to have been initiated from or near the surface of the transducer. They travel upwards towards the focal point of the transducer, which is about 5 cm above the transducer centre.
Streams of bubbles formed above the transducer of 8.0 cm in diameter when it is driven at high voltage (387 Vpp) at 20 kHz. The frame width is 5.8 cm. (a) The experimental observation of streams of bubbles mostly starting from the surface of the transducer and travelling towards the focal point located near the top of the figure. (b) A schematic of the trace of the streamers. The bubbles emerge from the motes (the source of the streamers) and form streamers which converge/merge and continue to travel towards the focal pressure antinode above the transducer. A movie file is available as the electronic supplementary material.
A similar structure is mentioned in [56]. Cylindrical transducers placed at the bottom and the top of a glass cylinder are used to generate an axially focused ultrasound field. The created structures consisting of the observed bubbles are termed ‘streamers’ (figure 12b); it is argued that the bubbles nucleate on ‘motes’ which are solid particles or gas pockets (impurities in the water). The primary Bjerknes force [57,59] drives the streamer bubbles (less than resonant size) to the focal pressure antinode.
Lauterborn and co-workers studied the streamers generated by a cylindrical transducer operating at 20 kHz with experimental observations [60,61] and numerical analysis [59,62–64]. The group termed the streamers ‘acoustic Lichtenberg figures’ (very similar to figure 12). In [61], a simple model of a two-phase mixture interacting with a travelling sound wave was presented. The pressure amplitude of the sound field depends on the location in space, and consequently also the resulting radial bubble oscillations. The result showed the evolution of the bubble concentration and sound field pressure distribution over time. Parlitz et al. [59] reported a new particle model for the bubble cloud. The bubble oscillations were calculated using the formulation from [65], which includes compressibility. The sound field is modelled using the wave equation from [66]. The results showed that the nonlinear bubble oscillation causes the movement of big and small bubbles (relative to the resonant bubble size) to pressure node and antinode to be less predictable. The authors also mentioned the complications from the secondary Bjerknes force, the added mass and the drag force. However, both added mass and drag force were not included in the calculation.
While the above mentioned model [63] attempts to predict the individual behaviour of each bubble, a totally different approach consisting of averaging the behaviour over many bubbles as a ‘mixture model’ has been proposed. For example, D'Agostino & Brennen [67] have reported the development of a one-dimensional bubble cloud simulation where the sound field was modelled as a Gaussian-shaped pressure distribution. The authors analysed the mode oscillation of a bubble cloud. There are limitations to this model, for instance the bubble cloud is spherical and interactions between the bubbles are not considered. Subsequently more complex models were developed (for example for vapour bubbles [58]). Doinikov [68] showed a Lagrangian formalism model which is capable of modelling the radial and translational motion of a bubble in a three-dimensional cluster in an ultrasound field. The interaction between the bubbles is considered up to the third order. However, the calculation requires the bubbles to be far apart. Pelekasis et al. [69] presented a two-bubble model based on Keller & Miksis [65]. The model considers compressibility. The authors used the calculation to study the attraction and repulsion of the two bubbles (of different sizes) in a sound field of various sound amplitudes.
An attempt to simulate a bubble cloud behaviour is presented in figure 13. The model is based on the numerical framework developed in [70]. Contrary to the above models, the bubbles are no longer always spherical and can now develop jets. No ultrasound is applied; instead, the bubbles oscillate because of an initially high internal pressure (‘explosion’ bubbles). The model is based on the BEM where only the bubble surfaces are meshed. There are 362 nodes on each bubble. All 37 bubbles are initiated with the same high initial pressure of 36 MPa (figure 13a). During the growth stages (figure 13b,c), the outer bubbles grow bigger than the inner ones due to a shielding effect. Also, the outer bubbles collapse earlier (last frame). They all jet towards the centre of the cloud while the inner bubbles have yet to collapse. This simulation shows the complex dynamics and interaction of individual bubbles in a bubble cloud. Note that all the bubbles in this particular simulation have been placed deliberately in the same plane, yet the shielding behaviour is already clearly observable. For bubbles in a random three-dimensional configuration (as in a real bubble cloud), this shielding effect will also be present (the bubbles in the centre are then shielded from all sides).
Three-dimensional simulation of the growth and collapse of a bubble cloud. There are 37 bubbles in the cloud, which are all placed in the same plane. They are initiated with a high initial pressure (a). They all expand (b,c). The outermost bubbles expand more than the bubbles in the centre. Eventually they collapse first, each developing a jet towards the cloud centre. The centre bubbles are ‘shielded' by the bubbles on the outermost ring and collapse later. (Online version in colour.)
The bubble clouds generated by HIFU at a high-voltage amplitude are complicated structures. In order to understand them better, we attempted to photograph the bubble cloud movement in a travelling sound field generated by the HIFU in a burst mode (figure 14). Under this burst mode, 500 cycles of the ultrasound (approx. 2 ms) are applied. The time for each frame in milliseconds is shown at the bottom of the frame. The experimental set-up is similar to that in figure 9. The concave HIFU transducer (Sonic Concepts) has a resonance frequency of 250 kHz, and a diameter of 64 mm. In the water tank, its focal height is about 50 mm. The video was taken with a high-speed camera (Photron FASTCAM SA5) and a long-distance microscope lens (Infinity K2).
An example of the nucleation and expansion of a bubble cloud in a travelling ultrasound wave. The ‘source' (at the nucleation point) sheds a large number of bubbles, and an ‘umbrella'shaped structure is formed on top. The ‘comet' probably consists of many very small bubbles. A movie file is available as the electronic supplementary material.
As seen in figure 14, the bubbles first appear in a spherical cloud (t = 0). Then the cloud starts to elongate, with the top part of the bubble cloud beginning to spread out (from t = 0.27 ms to t = 1.6 ms). During this process, the bubble cloud looks like a ‘comet’. Eventually, the bubbles form an ‘umbrella’ shape structure. The size of the structure reaches about 2 mm (t = 2.93 ms). It is interesting to note that a typical speed of a ‘comet’ was 1.5 m s−1 (figure 14), which is many times the rising speed of an individual bubble rising solely because of buoyancy (which would be in the range of mm s−1 or even smaller). Also the expansion of the top bubbles occurs in multiple directions.
Mettin [71] gives a summary of various bubble structures that have been observed in a standing HIFU field. He describes the movement of ‘small’ and ‘large’ clusters (up to a few hundred) of bubbles in a standing wave. The structure shown in figure 14 was described as a ‘comet’ by Mettin [72]. In Crum & Nordling [3], the same structure was termed ‘feathery track’. The formation and dynamics of these structures is still not well understood. Figure 15 shows an ensemble of at least four different comets occurring simultaneously. It is seen that there are multiple sources (or comets) as indicated by the arrows. The bubbles generated at these sources move in different directions. It is obvious that the development of numerical capabilities to simulate such complicated behaviour as seen in figure 15 will be a unique challenge.
The nucleation and trailing movement of the bubble clouds generated by the HIFU transducer in burst mode. The sources are indicated by arrows. The width of the frame is 200 µm. It is seen that there are multiple sources in a cloud. The bubbles generated at the sources move in all directions. A movie file is available as the electronic supplementary material.
Apart from the ‘umbrella’ shape as shown in figure 14, other shapes of bubble clouds have been observed when the HIFU is operating in a burst mode. Figure 16 shows the formation of a ring-shaped bubble cloud. Mettin [71] has reported a stream of bubbles forming a ring-shaped structure. The rings of streaming bubbles in Mettin [71] are thin, probably only a few bubbles in thickness. The ring in figure 16, however, seems to be at least tens, if not hundreds, of bubbles in thickness. Also the bubble cloud is initially spherical. It expands into a ring as the bubbles move upwards.
The formation of a ring-shaped bubble cloud. Time in milliseconds is given in the left-hand bottom corner of each frame. The frame width is 1.3 mm. The HIFU is operated at 100 kHz for a 1000 burst cycle with a driving voltage of 260 Vpp. The framing rate is 10 000 frames s−1. It is seen that the initial spherical bubble cloud moves upwards and expands at the same time eventually forming a ring-shaped structure (t = 0.8 and 10.0 ms). A movie file is available as the electronic supplementary material.
The dynamics of bubble clouds in a HIFU field is complex. The nucleation sites (sources or comets) are perhaps where the motes (solid particles) or gas pockets are. Each bubble interacts with the primary and secondary Bjerknes forces. It is also not clear if these bubble clouds are generated when HIFU is applied in clinical treatment. As about 60% of an adult male human (not obese) consists of water, it is conjectured that bubble clouds as described may form at the focal volume of the HIFU transducer when it is applied to the human body (although strictly, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there is not yet any experimental evidence to show this). One can surmise that the propagation of HIFU waves to the focal region may not be too adversely affected by reflection as the acoustic impedance of the (high water content) tissues can be fairly close to that of water. There are, however, differences between water and tissue; for example, free movement is limited at tissue boundaries. Yet, similar to what is shown in figure 4 on the interaction of gelatin and a shock wave, at high HIFU intensities (near the focal point), it is possible that this tissue liquefies in a similar manner and still exhibits a more fluid-like character. To what extent the results obtained with water can be extrapolated to human tissue thus remains an open question.
The bubble clouds behave differently in the presence of a nearby boundary. Figure 17 shows the formation and movement of a bubble cloud above a membrane in an ultrasound field generated by the HIFU system depicted in figure 9. The sound field frequency is 27 kHz, and the driving voltage is 150 Vpp. Once more we start by investigating the phenomena at a very low frequency (in order to be able to record the phenomena more easily), before turning our attention to the more common HIFU frequencies. The bubble A oscillates and travels towards the membrane (t = 0 to 0.4 ms). It is seen to have collapsed and formed a bubble cloud at t = 0.5 and 0.55 ms. Then the bubble cloud A moves across the surface of the membrane (t = 0.7 ms) and merges with bubble cloud B (t = 0.75 ms) to form bubble cloud C (t = 0.8 ms). Bubble cloud C continues to oscillate and move across the membrane surface until it encounters bubble D (t = 1.25 ms). The bubbles merge to form bubble cloud E (t = 1.3 ms). The cloud moves on the surface from t = 1.7 to 2.4 ms before it moves out of the frame.
The movement of a bubble cloud towards a membrane surface (a surgical glove) in an ultrasound field. The membrane is placed near the focal region of the transducer. The time in milliseconds is given in the left-hand top corner of each frame. The framing rate is 20 000 frames s−1. The ultrasound field is 27 kHz (which is very low and not representative of the common or typical HIFU frequencies). The driving voltage is 150 Vpp. It can be seen that bubble A moves towards the membrane (located at the bottom of the frame) (t = 0 to 0.4 ms). Then it breaks into a bubble cloud on the membrane (t = 0.5 ms), and merges with bubble cloud B (t = 0.75 ms) into a bubble cloud C (t = 0.8 ms). Another bubble D (t = 0.95 ms) appears and combines with C to form the bubble cloud E, which then moves across the surface (t = 1.3 to 2.4 ms). The width of each frame is 0.6 mm.
In another experiment, a similar transducer with a higher resonance frequency of 250 kHz was used. An aluminium foil of 10 µm in thickness was placed near the focal point of the transducer about 5 cm from the transducer surface (figure 18). After sonication, small holes were observed in the aluminium foil. Bubble clouds were seen to pass through the holes, and reappear at the other side of the hole. It is very likely that individual bubbles create high-speed jets, which eventually cause sufficient damage to generate the holes on the foil. For both cases shown in figures 17 and 18, the presence of a wall greatly influences the dynamical behaviour of the bubble cloud.
The interaction of bubble clouds with aluminium foil placed at the focal point (approx. 5 cm) above the transducer (out of frame). It is operated at 250 kHz with a driving voltage of 180 Vpp. After 20 s of sonication (a: t = 20 s), a small hole appears (b: arrow at t = 20.004 s). In a separate experiment, the same foil is subjected to 60 s sonication. Large holes (arrows) appear on the foil (c: t = 60 s).
At a lower driving voltage (120–150 Vpp), the bubbles form concentrated circles above the transducer (figure 19). The radii of the bubbles range between 0.25 and 1.0 mm. They are trapped in the pressure node of the standing waves. The separation between the circles is about 3 mm, which is half the wavelength of the standing waves created by the 250 kHz transducer.
Bubbles in concentric circles above the transducer operating at 250 kHz, driving voltage of 120 Vpp. The standing wave is stabilized by a rigid reflector which is placed about 10 cm above the transducer. The visible bubbles are larger than the resonance radius RRes (here RRes = 12 µm; see appendix A). They move accordingly to the pressure nodes because of the primary Bjerknes force. (Online version in colour.)
In order to stabilize the bubble circles (or rings), a rigid reflector (same bowl shape as the transducer) is placed about 10 cm above the transducer (out of view in figure 19). The bubbles in the circles are not static, but move around in each circle. They may also coalesce, jump between the rings or escape altogether due to buoyancy when the size becomes sufficiently large.
When zooming in on an individual bubble in figure 19, the movement of a single bubble (dotted white line) towards a trapped bubble in the concentrated ring is shown in figure 20. The bubble has been nucleated near the large trapped bubble. It moves in a zigzag manner to the pressure node where the large bubble is trapped. The bubbles eventually coalesce. More small bubbles nucleate, move towards the large bubble, and coalesce with it. The coalescence of the bubbles increases the size of the trapped large bubble gradually. When the trapped bubble reaches a critical size of about 400 µm in diameter, the buoyancy force causes it to float upwards.
The movement of a single bubble (nucleated near the left-hand side of the frame) towards the bubble trapped in the concentric ring. The small bubble has a diameter of 25 µm, and the stationary large bubble has a diameter of 300 µm. Many small bubbles nucleate (randomly in the water), and move towards the nearest trapped large bubble. Eventually, the large bubbles reach a critical size of about 400 µm in diameter. They will then float upwards due to buoyancy. The trajectory of the small bubble is that of a typical ‘dancing’ bubble as termed by Mettin & Doinikov [73]. (Online version in colour.)
At an even lower driving voltage of 80–100 Vpp, the concentrated circles of bubbles disappear. In their place, a stream of bubbles appears to move from the transducer to the top of the water tank (figure 21). These bubbles are nucleated on the transducer surface. They move along the direction of the travelling waves and eventually float to the top of the water surface. There is no standing wave in the tank. This is because the ultrasound reflected from the free surface is too weak to form a standing wave with the ultrasound generated from the transducer. The bubble stream is funnel-shaped with a narrow middle because of the focusing effect of the sound waves from the bowl-shaped transducer.
A stream of bubbles moving from the transducer surface to the top of the water tank in the direction of the travelling ultrasound wave. The transducer is driven at 250 kHz with 80 Vpp. The black arrow indicates the focal point of the transducer at approximately 5 cm from the transducer. The difference between figure 19 and the current figure is most probably due to the lack of a standing wave field, as the acoustic field is not strong enough now. A movie file is available as the electronic supplementary material. (Online version in colour.)
This ends our discussion on surface oscillations, bubble clouds and streamers which occur during the application of HIFU.
As discussed in §2, ESWL is now widely accepted as a treatment for kidney stones. Bubble dynamics plays a crucial role here. HIFU is used to treat, for example, prostate cancer. It has been tested for histotripsy (mechanical tissue fractionation using HIFU) and sonothrombolysis (removal of blood clots using sound waves). Often it is essential in medical treatments to estimate and control collateral damage to nearby tissues. The damage could be caused by cavitation bubble activities or heating of the surrounding tissue [6].
The main question, which is largely unanswered, is whether the phenomena shown above, which all occur in water-based systems, also manifest themselves in the human body when HIFU is applied. The answer to this question is not easy, as the human body is not all fluid. Also because of the high frequency of HIFU, the observation of cavitation or bubbles, even with the high-speed equipment available today, is still a major challenge. This is further complicated by the fact that most bubbles are of a very small size. It could be argued that, at least in tissue with a high water content, many of the above effects are likely to be present in some form or another. Now, if even some of the above phenomena do occur, what would be the effect of the bubbles? For example, would the occurrence of free radicals [74] outweigh the advantages of the non-invasiveness of the therapy?
In an attempt to avoid such potential problems related to HIFU in the human body itself, some research has been conducted using HIFU in a microfluidic environment. A major obstacle was the creation of cavitation bubbles in such systems (owing to a lack of nucleation spots in the small volumes of liquid involved). Tandiono et al. [75] reports the development of an ultrasonic microfluidics platform where strongly oscillating bubbles are generated. The authors have a gas inlet and a liquid in their microfluidics channel. The gas–liquid interface is excited by an external transducer around 100 kHz (the resonant frequency of the microfluidics system). The surface waves created facilitate the generation of strongly oscillating cavitation bubbles and even sonoluminiscence [76]. The developed platform can potentially be used to harvest cell contents, for cell lysis or other treatments [77]. The development of HIFU for microfluidic systems is still at a very early stage though.
New areas in shock wave applications include advanced designs of transducers (electroconductive systems [78] and electromagnetic and piezoelectric sources [79]), development in clinical techniques for maximizing effectiveness of stone fragmentation [80], and minimizing collateral damage to nearby tissues and organs [81]. HIFU remains an interesting area of research. New medical applications currently being tested include the use of HIFU for essential tremor treatment [55], sonothrombolysis [82] and non-invasive detection of tumours [83]. Other areas of interest that could be mentioned are in dentistry applications [84–86], for example for root canal cleaning. Also, the incorporation of UCA microbubbles for therapeutic purposes opens a new field of possibilities apart from imaging. The backscattering from such bubbles could potentially be used for tissue property measurements.
Fascinating phenomena on bubble shock waves and ultrasound interaction have been shown in this review. Most of the interaction involves complex physics. Considerable progress can still be achieved in our understanding of the interplay between ultrasound, oscillating bubbles and biomaterials, which in return will benefit any potential treatment. Modelling and simulation tools are still far from achieving a complete fundamental understanding of the phenomena involved. This is especially so for the dynamics of streamers and bubble clouds such as those shown in figures 12,14–18. The purpose of the current article, for these phenomena, far from giving an explanation, is merely to show the phenomena involved, even though we do not understand them fully, or even know under which conditions they appear. The most likely way forward is a gradual improvement in our knowledge by a combination of experimental, numerical and theoretical techniques. Fundamental understanding of bubble HIFU interaction will be facilitated by better high-speed photography techniques and higher computing power. The advantages of the non-invasiveness of sound waves for medical treatments or imaging remain a primary driving force for innovation.
Much of the physics involved in oscillating bubble dynamics can be deduced from the equation that describes the evolution of a spherical bubble, the so-called Rayleigh–Plesset equation. Lord Rayleigh [87] derived this equation based on energy considerations. An alternative approach based on the Bernoulli equation is followed here (figure 22).
Imagine a bubble with radius R oscillating (i.e. changing volume) in an infinite fluid. If the velocity of the bubble wall is indicated with dR/dt, then simple preservation of mass over the bubble surface and at some distance ‘r' from the bubble must give (with the radial velocity at radius r indicated as ‘u'): ρ4πr2u = ρ4πR2dR/dt (with ρ the density of the liquid). Both u and dR/dt can be positive or negative (expanding or collapsing bubble, respectively). Thus, the radial velocity anywhere in the liquid is u = R2/r2 dR/dt. A velocity potential ϕ (with definition u = ∂ϕ/∂r) can be introduced as: ϕ = R2/r dR/dt. Besides mass conservation, the second piece of physics that can be injected is the Bernoulli equation, relating the pressure in the liquid, p, to the velocity as:
A 1 in which t represents time and pref is a reference pressure (such as the atmospheric pressure). The last term in this equation arises from the fact that the flow is unsteady and thus one must use the unsteady Bernoulli equation with the term ∂ϕ/∂t = −2R/r(dR/dt)2−R2/r d2R/dt2 (the above derived expression for the potential is used here). At the bubble surface (r = R), ignoring surface tension and viscous effects for simplicity, the pressure must be equal to the pressure inside the bubble, pb, and the velocity of the fluid must be equal to u = dR/dt. Thus finally,
A 2 This is the simplest form of the Rayleigh–Plesset equation, the equation of motion for a spherical bubble [88]. For an alternative derivation see also [57]. It cannot be solved analytically. However, if the reference pressure pref is constant (not an explicit function of time as is the case for sound waves) and if pb is only a function of the bubble radius, an analytical solution expressing dR/dt as a function of R can be found. For example, if pb = 0 and if the initial radius is R0, assuming zero initial velocity, then, according to Rayleigh, the solution of equation (A 2) is
A 3 This can easily be verified by back-substitution (see also [89]). Integrating dR/dt, with the help of a gamma-function, Rayleigh then found the Rayleigh collapse time, the time it takes for a bubble to collapse from r = R0 to r = 0 as:
The pressure inside the bubble consists of the sum of two partial pressures, the vapour pressure of the water, pv (usually negligible), and the pressure of the non-condensable gas inside the bubble, pg. Usually this is taken to behave adiabatically (as there is not much time for the bubble to exchange heat with its surroundings), i.e. pg = pg0(R0/R)3γ, with pg0 the initial gas pressure corresponding to R0 and γ the ratio of specific heats of the gas (γ ∼ 1.4).
For mildly oscillating bubbles, equation (A 2) can give us further information about the resonance frequency of a bubble. Assume that the bubble oscillates around a resonance radius RRes as R = RRes + ɛ sin ωt, with
such that dR/dt = ɛω cos ωt and d2R/dt2 = ɛω2 sin ωt. Substituting these in equation (A 2) and noting that the first term is of order ɛ2 while only retaining terms of order ɛ:
if the angular frequency is replaced by ω = 2πf, then, finally, the Minnaert resonance frequency [90] for standard water under atmospheric pressure is recovered:
This result is very useful when dealing with low-amplitude sound waves interacting with bubbles. For example, a frequency of f = 100 kHz would give RRes = 30 µm (for higher frequencies surface tension effects become important [6]). If the bubbles in a standing acoustic wave are smaller than RRes, they will travel to the pressure antinodes, while bubbles larger than RRes will move to the pressure nodes instead. A specially designed highly accurate numerical BEM without singularities which was recently developed for sound waves [91] would perhaps be useful for an even better understanding of the scattering phenomena involved in these situations. Surface tension, liquid viscosity and compressibility can be included in more advanced versions of the above shown equations relatively easily.

The process of making novel CMOS compatible vertical MOSFET by incorporating Dielectric Pocket (DP) is shown using virtual wafer simulation tool. The corresponding device doping profiles of a junction is highlighted and demonstrated good device profiles for the feasibility of the approach. The effect of amorph Si recrystallization as the result of different RTA time is also evaluated. Both the transfer and output characteristics of the DP vertical MOSFETs indicates a reasonable value of drive and off -leakage current (I ON and IOFF), sub-threshold swing (S) and Drain Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL). The increasing time of RTA to 100 s shows better performance of the device than for shorter time, but in the thread-off of higher drain junction depth and leakage current. Â©2008 IEEE.
A polar-orbiting weather satellite (POES) orbits Earth in a nearly	north-south direction passing near the poles.It travels in a relatively low altitude (800 to	1000 km). The satellite’s orbit traces	out a plane in space while the planet continually rotates	on its axis through the plane of the satellite’s orbit. With	each orbit, points on Earth’s surface (except near the	poles) move eastward so that onboard sensors sweep	out successive overlapping north/south strips.
A geostationary weather satellite (GOES) revolves around Earth at the	same rate and in the same direction as the planet rotates so	that the satellite is always positioned over the same spot	on Earth’s surface and its sensors have a consistent field of	view. The sub-satellite point, the location on	Earth’s surface directly below the satellite, is essentially on the equator.

I told Shintaro-nii that I wanted to visit Host Club because it looked interesting from what I read on Shoujo Manga. But he's very worried about me so he suggested Butler or Maid Cafe instead.. Told Toru-san afterward that I want to go to Butler Cafe in Akiba, and he brought me to Refleurir
We went there straight from Shibuya after visiting Be-Staff Make up School. Akibahara is quite far, takes about 25 minutes by train from Shibuya.. But Akiba is really a different area compared to other areas in Tokyo. It's really anime-ish, otaku-ish, and fun lol
I was running around Akiba to get pictures of real Otaku, and it looked very silly as if you see, a gaijin gyaru takes pic of otaku, it's very wtf lol But in the end got no good pic cos they're very fast hiding their faces. I guess it's cos they're too used to taking pic of someone else so they know if they're being taken pictures
Hence I will just simply blog about the Refleurir Butler Cafe XD Which is like, one of my main highlights on this trip xD
Like any other places, Refleurir Butler Cafe is located inside a building in Akiba. We used google map to reach there
One of the butler receptionist told us about how the cafe went. We had to order one dish and one drink for 80 minutes stay. Then he brought us to the real cafe
When I stepped inside, the butlers greeted us in a polite manner. They bow while speaking "welcome to the cafe" in very polite Japanese. Then Toru-san said that I came from Indonesia, so I only understand a little bit Japanese. Then one butler, with glasses, spoke english suddenly!!!
He spoke in a very formal english as well and very fluent so if you're a tourist, I do recommend Refleurir Butler Cafe as they have a japanese butler that speaks english.. Other cafes mostly dont have english speaker butler. I know there's an english butler cafe in Shibuya, but the butlers are white people lol
Unfortunately I cannot take picture of the restaurant or the butlers in charge, they do not offer service of photo either [some cafes charge about 1000yen for a picture with butler] so yeah, I let the imagination goes inside your mind lol
There were 3 butlers in charge at that time. An ikemen [means good looking] butler like anime, his hair is styled perfectly and has anime face. Very pretty one *_* but he doesn't speak english hahaha, I wish my japanese were better so I could get him as my butler LOL
Then there was a tall butler that looks very manly one. And the butler in charge of my table, is the small sized one LOL if you say in manga, he is a character who is the smart type. With glasses, speak english perfectly, and behave very nicely. But not very dependable? LOL
Like I said, we had to order at least one food and one beverage. You can order one dessert and one beverage too. But I went with today's set because I was quite hungry lol
They offer like about 50-60 types of tea o_o So I asked my butler *coughs* what he recommended lol as I don't like bitter stuffs
I can pick my own tea cup set too!! Picked september because it's my birth month. But you can pick other tea sets according to colors or flower. I just picked my birth month. Lotsa possibilities XD
Very very refreshing. The taste is very light and not very sweet for all the foods. They really make it according to women's taste XD
Toru-san friend is the one who distributes Fairy Drops Mascara and he gives me one cos he heard from Toru-san that I am a beauty blogger. I told him that fairy drops are very popular but difficult to purchase and ask him to bring it to Indonesia XD
Anyway okay okay I know you guys must be very curious about how it feels at Butler Cafe. So I wrote these "Shit Butler Says" after I came back from the cafe so I wont forget lol
B = "I am sorry Danna-sama, Ojou-Sama, I am only a lowly servant and I have no right to touch you nor your personal belongings otherwise Big Master would be angry to me"
B = *comes with mango tea and puts it nicely* "My young lady, September flower is Daisy, do you know what Daisy means?"
S = *whispers to Toru-san* Hey, I don't think it's real, they just want to make it sound high class lol
B = "My lady, please call me when you want to refill your cup. The tea pot is very dangerous and Big Master would be angry if you hurt your precious fingers"
B = "My Lady, I know you since you were from a little kid, so please, order me anything! Your order is my pleasure. I will do anything"
B = "Yes you can order me anything, my name is xxx *i forgot wtf* so please, do something like, xxx, ocha!"
B = "I am sorry my young lady but I cannot take pictures with you because you and I are from different status so with all my respect, I cannot be on the same picture with you"
B = "My young lady, Big Master has prepared for your carriage and it would arrive within 15 minutes so please be ready"
B = "Young lady, It is my honour to serve you. Under, we have prepared for your pink dress to keep you beautiful so you may take it and please be safe on your travel"
I think they mentioned so many things but I laughed a lot and I enjoyed every second when I was there so I apologize I cannot mention every single thing.. But it's very good and I really recommend you to go to Refleurir!!! Especially if you're a gaijin/foreigner that wants to experience Butler Cafe but cannot speak Japanese!
I really want to visit it again if I have chance to come to Japan again, after all though it's pricey but it's quite fun and funny experience lol

Amazon has begun early delivery of Walter Isaacson’s much anticipated Steve Job’ biography to Kindle users.
As the screenshot below from @davidj, editor of Tmonews, shows, users of the Amazon reading device are getting their pre-ordered copies of the book before the official release date tomorrow, October 24.
Despite the early deliveries, the Amazon store is still listing the book’s release date as October 24.
Preorders for the biography jumped 4,180% after the former Apple CEO passed away earlier this month, and the news that Kindle owners are getting their hands on the copy early is a true sign of Amazon considerable influence and power in the distribution industry today.
In delivering a book that is so eagerly awaited by industry observers and general Apple and gadget fans, Amazon may have just provided another reason to own its Kindle device.
Isaacson’s biography is the first major release in a long line of Steve Jobs tributes that is likely to include a film, after Sony purchased the rights, while an authorised biography is tipped too be released in 2012.
According to Korean ET News, Samsung Mobile’s Advanced Development Team has started work on 20 megapixel camera modules with the goal to ship them in second half of 2014. Which is right about the time their flagship Galaxy Note 4 phablet is scheduled to come out and should be the logical device to show off new camera capabilities.
Samsung decided to continue to increase its camera megapixel count as the main differentiating feature, after they failed to include Optical Image Stabilization function for its next generation 2014 flagships. Samsung expects that 25%, or 90 million of their smartphones in 2014 will be equipped with high end 16 megapixel camera modules. However, due to limited supply of some parts like autofocus actuators, those cameras won’t have OIS.
Thank’s to the huge volumes of flagship devices they ship, Samsung expects 16 megapixel cameras to become a new standard in high end devices next year, with pixel count moving to 20 million in 2015.

The eye can be analyzed with relative ease as to both its function and its structure. A practical assessment consists of the capability to relocate the orbit and the response of the student to light and accommodation.
The function of the eye might be evaluated in several ways. The client might be asked to identify illuminated letter or things of varying sizes on what is referred to as the Snellen chart.
On the other hand, the evaluation of the structural part of the eye may be made in several methods. Stress within the eyeball is measured by a "tonometer." In certain illness, especially in glaucoma, the stress in the eyeball is increased considerably.
It should be well remembered that a patient with an eye issue may have other problems. Frequently other physical conditions are main and impact the eye as a effect. The look of the eye can notify the client and the doctor to problems in some disruptions of other parts of the body even before other symptoms present themselves.
Consequently, one's dependence on sight is stressed when one deals with a possible or momentary irreversible loss of this important sense. Thus, when corrective measures are looked for, particular types of vision correction such as contact lenses or spectacles are prescribed.
On the other hand, some individuals are bothered with the fact that they have some framed lenses or contact lenses in front of their eyes.
For this factor, advanced surgical operations were established to motivate reduced usage of contact lenses or glasses. One of which is the now popular LASIK eye surgery.
Generally, LASIK eye surgery is the short-term for "Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis." Like its concrete counterpart, LASIK eye surgical treatment is another kind of vision correction. The only difference is that with this kind of surgery, one's vision is corrected permanently.
The primary purpose of this surgery is to produce a threadlike, rounded "flap" in the cornea using a blade referred to as "microkeratome." In a series of unfolding and laser processing, the cornea is lastly reformed, permitting better the eye to direct more light into the retina.
Amidst the growing popularity of LASIK eye surgery, there are still disadvantages that people should understand. Probably, the primary reason that this type of eye surgery has actually become well accepted is because the majority of its cases had been effective.
Because LASIK eye surgery includes the operation of the retina, which is one of the most sensitive parts of the eye, many people say click site that the operation can be very risky.
To puts it simply, a simple error could practically trigger an person's lifetime blindness. click for more It is important to consider many elements prior to choosing whether LASIK eye surgery is the best corrective measure one has to go through.
LASIK eye surgery may remedy your vision however it does not always mean that it can give you a twenty-twenty. Even if analytical reports show that 70% of the patients may have 20/20 vision, this does not necessarily imply they have ideal vision as well.
Provided all these things, it can be deduced that, in spite of the popularity of the operation, LASIK might not constantly be the ideal eye surgical treatment the method the majority of people see it
Alternatively, the examination of the structural part of the eye may be made in numerous methods. It must be well remembered that a patient with an eye issue may have other problems. Often other physical conditions are main and impact the eye as a consequence. The appearance of the eye can signal the client and the physician to difficulties in some disruptions of other parts of the body even before other signs present themselves.

Mortgage refinancing is usually advertised as a means to get a better deal on your mortgage rates by taking out another loan that pays off your initial loan and replaces it with a loan under “better terms.” If you are not careful, though, mortgage refinancing can lead to a deal that is even more expensive than your first mortgage. Read on to learn how to make the most out of your mortgage refinancing loan:
Before you start looking for companies and refinancing deals, make sure that you are fully aware of your situation and the options that are available to you. Try to analyze your current mortgage loan, the rates, and the overall expenses and fees so you can get a good idea of the total costs that you are looking at. Remember that there are a lot of risks involved in refinancing loans, so you may want to get help from financial experts, friends, or relatives who have experience with mortgage loans and refinancing.
When you are considering getting a mortgage refinancing loan, you should only deal with companies that are well known and reputable. In doing so, you will be sure that your finances and your home are in safe and dependable hands. Aside from reading reviews and comments on certain lenders, you can also check the reliability of such companies through well known rating sites such as the Better Business Bureau.
Now that you have a good idea of all the factors involved in mortgages, refinancing, and your own financial situation, you can make a well educated and well thought decision on the refinancing plan that is best for you. Compare and contrast the deals that have been offered to you. Once you find two or three deals that you like, try to negotiate with the companies to see if they can give you better terms on your refinancing loan. Finally, choose the refinancing loan that is the safest, cheapest, and most reliable plan to get you through these tough economic times.
Of course, you can always explore other options than mortgage refinancing so you won’t get stuck in debt. You can create your own budget cuts or look for other sources of income. But especially during these tough times, you need to consider options that will grant you better loan agreements. If you’re having trouble financially, you can always look for loans that have offer longer payment period or provide better payment scheme for your situation.

In this episode of Open Door, Grammy-winning record producer and DJ Zedd gives an in-depth tour of his $16 million mansion in Benedict Canyon, an area of Los Angeles that's near Sherman Oaks and northwest of Beverly Hills. Zedd's self-decorated home is 9,500 square feet with views of the canyon and tons of full-length glass windows. See photos and read the full interview here: http://archdg.co/x3PLMMq The house is structured into three sections: work, living, and sleep. The work section has Zedd's recording studio and an unfinished gym. The driveway leads into the front entrance, which crosses a moat. A huge wall with cubbies holds art, awards, and silly memorabilia. For instance, Zedd's Grammy sits next to a poop emoji. At the end of a corridor, before going outside, guests can pick their favorite flavor of the rainbow from the Skittles machine. Zedd also has a server room and a "Costco Room" that contains just about anything he would need if he weren't able to leave the house for a long time. The bathrooms feature automated blinds that can sometimes surprise the person taking the shower early in the morning. The remote-controlled curtains in Zedd's bedroom make him the happiest of any feature in the house. Outside, the pool has a hidden jacuzzi / hot tub that's revealed when the pool's water level drops. The kitchen has four built-in hibachi grills, a pot filler above the stovetop (which Zedd says is the reason he bought the house), and built-in vacuums.

How To Make Easy Birthday Cake At Home - Simple Sponge Cake Recipe - Indian Sweet Weigh three eggs, and use an equivalent weight of fat, sugar, and flour. An authentic British sponge cake is made by first mixing the fat with the sugar and then by beating the eggs with the sugar-fat mix, until this is light and creamy, then carefully sieving and folding in the flour. Depending on the recipe, the flour may be mixed with a small amount of baking powder though some recipes use only the air incorporated into the egg mixture, relying on the denaturing of the egg proteins and the thermal expansion of the air to provide leavening. In the French version the yolks are beaten with the sugar first while the whites are beaten separately to a meringue-like foam, to be gently folded in later. The mixture is then poured into a cake tin and baked. Both methods take great care to incorporate air in the beating, whisking, and sieving stages. This makes a very light product, but it is easy to lose the air by removing the cake from the oven before it has finished cooking. Before the cooked cake has cooled, it is still flexible. This allows the creation of rolled cakes such as the Swiss roll. This basic recipe is also used for many treats and puddings, such as madeleines, ladyfingers, and trifles, as well as some versions of strawberry shortcake. In addition, the foam cake technique is used in angel food cake (where only egg whites are used) and some recipes for Belgian waffles (where the egg whites are separated from the yolks and folded into the batter at the end of preparation Sponge cake is a cake based on flour (usually wheat flour), sugar, butter and eggs, and is sometimes leavened with baking powder. It has a firm yet well-aerated structure, similar to a sea sponge. In the United Kingdom a sponge cake is produced using the batter method, while in the US cakes made using the batter method are known as butter or pound cakes. Two common British batter-method sponge cakes are the layered Victoria sponge cake and Madeira cake. Cakes made using the foam method are not classed as sponge cakes in the UK; these cakes are classed as foam cakes, which are quite different. These cakes are common in Europe, especially in Italian patisseries. The cake was first invented by the Italian pastry chef Giovan Battista Cabona (called Giobatta), at the court of Spain with his lord, the Genoese marquis Domenico Pallavicini, around the middle of the 16th century. The sponge cake is thought to be one of the first of the non-yeasted cakes, and the earliest attested sponge cake recipe in English is found in a book by the English poet Gervase Markham, The English Huswife, Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues Which Ought to Be in a Complete Woman (1615). Though it does not appear in Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery made Plain and Easy (1747) in the late 18th century, it is found in Lydia Maria Child's The American Frugal Housewife (1832), indicating that sponge cakes had been established in Grenada in the Caribbean by the early 19th century. Variations on the theme of a cake lifted, partially or wholly, by trapped air in the batter exist in most places where European patisserie has spread, including the Anglo-Jewish plava Italian génoise, the Portuguese pão-de-ló, and the possibly ancestral Italian pan di Spagna Derivatives of the basic sponge cake idea include the American chiffon cake and the Latin American tres leches cake.

Here are some tools and material you may need 3/4 inch PVC pipe - http://amzn.to/2zdlXlt Drill Bit Set - http://amzn.to/2BblbXH Key Hole file set - http://amzn.to/2zegGKo Its a really low cost and really rewarding build! you will need a piece of 3/4 inch (19 mm) schedule 40 PVC pipe at least 19 inches long! Its better to make it long so when you tune it you wont start out below the key you want. You will need a cork from a wine bottle, they work really well for this size pipe. You will also need a needle fine set and a flat file. The first step is to make a center mark on you pipe so all your holes will line up. The easiest way to accomplish this is to take a piece of wood at least the length of your pipe and but your pipe up against it, then simply take a pen or a marker and run it along the top of your piece of wood, as shown in the video. Now you will need to make a line from one end of the pipe the first line is 1 7/8 inch (48mm) from the end and the second is at 3 1/2 inches (89mm). Then you will use your flat file to file the pipe between those two marks, until the flat part is about 7/16 inch (11mm) wide, This is the part of the flute that will generate the sound. Now you will need to mark a line where your holes will go at 2 1/4 inches (57mm) and at 3 inches (76mm). Now drill a 3/16 inch (5mm) hole in the spots you just marked. Next you will need to draw out the actual hole size you need which is a square, 3/16 inch (5mm) by 3/8 inches (10mm), This is where you will need the needle files set. The first hole that you filed out is where the air will be blowing out of and the second is the hole that the air will be forced to blow back into, this is where the noise is made. Next you will need to file down the front of the second hole you filed out, you will need to file it down at a 45 degree angle as shown in the video. Next you will need to get a measurement between the two holes you filed out, it should be around 1/2 inch (12.5mm) Now you will need to cut the wine bottle cork down to this size and push it inside the pipe until it is between the two holes, as shown in the video. Now you will need to make your bird, this is the part that will force the air coming up from the first hole to go into the second hole that you beveled at a 45 degree angle. I simply took a piece of 1 inch (25mm) pipe and cut it to 1 1/2 inches (38mm) long, Then I took a hand saw and cut one side of the pipe length wise as shown in the video, then all you do is slid it over the end of the pipe you have been working on and adjust it until you get the low tone you are looking for, you wont need to blow very hard at all for this flute to work, in fact if you blow too hard it wont make the low pitch and you wont get it tuned right. The next step is to tune it, you will need a tuner of course, you can download one on your phone like I did to make it easier. Now to tune a flute you will be cutting off the opposite end you have been working on, you will only want to do about 1/8 inch (3mm) or less at a time because a little goes a long way when tuning. Something to keep in mind is the shorter the pipe the higher the tone, If you go too far you will have to start all over and make another flute, or you could simply extend the flute with a PVC coupling, I haven't tried this so I cant guarantee it will work, but its worth a shot. Once you are getting close to the desired note, you will need to finish it up with your flat file so that you don't take too much off. Now to find the finger holes I used a website I showed you in the video and Ill put the link up for you right here http://www.flutopedia.com/naflutomat_1_37_1.htm All you need to put into this is the size pipe you are using and the key you are tuning your flute to. I show more about this in the video. You can adjust the holes sizes like I did to make it a specific drill bit size like I did. I made all my holes 5/16 inches (8mm). The chart will tell you where to put your finger holes measuring from the end you cut down to tune it. The measurements I had were as follows 4 1/16in (103mm), 5 7/16in (138mm), 6 13/16in (173mm), 7 5/8in (193mm), 8 3/4in (222mm), and 9 5/8in (244mm) If you enjoyed this project be sure and check out my other video making a bass style native american PVC pipe flute it's tuned in the key of C4. here is the link https://youtu.be/NjICdkjTIHY We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.

Special Alert: Now Available In Your Area! Hi, my name is Ross Williams . Let me share a personal story with you. Back in 2007, I held an excellent position at a large IT company with a nice monthly salary. By 2008, the great recession hit. The company ran into financial problems and was forced to lay off over 50% of its staff. Unfortunately for me, I was included. So there I was stranded, unemployed, with all the bills to pay and a family to support. Where I lived, such jobs werent easy to come by. So I decided to do a little research. I spent many sleepless nights on the web just searching for something to do, anything that could help support me and my family. I just wanted a way to make money, and not lose it, as I soon found to be the case with numerous internet scams. Just like you, I often stumbled upon all types of web sites offering me some money matrix scheme, promising me all the money in the world. Yeah, right! From stuffing envelopes, Multi Level Marketing, High Yield Investment Programs, to selling all types of useless products. You name it, Ive been there, done that.
Finally, I came across something that worked. Online advertising has skyrocketed over the past few years. In 2015, companies spent close to $50 billion advertising online. That figure is expected to increase substantially in 2016. What does this mean for you? A lot more money could be going into your bank account this year. Thats IF you take advantage of this secret system. Companies worldwide are desperately searching for people just like you to type up their ads and post them online, and theyll pay you nicely in return. Its a win-win situation. They get more customers, you get paid. Its as simple as that. These companies have cash, LOTS of it and theyre eager to share it with you. All types of individuals around the world are using this system to make more money than they ever could working in a boring, dead-end job. You can work part-time or full-time, its all up to you.

In stage 1 of the treatment, therapy is focused on getting behavioral control. People who enter treatment at this stage are actively struggling with life threatening behaviors (e.g. cutting, suicide attempts, excessive drinking), treatment interfering behaviors (e.g dropping out of treatment, hostility towards therapist, skipping therapy) and major quality of life interfering behaviors (e.g. risk of losing housing, being expelled from school, losing marriage, custody of children).
The rationale for focusing on gaining behavioral control at this point is that it is assumed that a life lived out-of-control is excruciating. Progress cannot be made on underlying emotional issues until you have the skill to manage emotion without engaging in dangerous behaviors and are committed to the process of therapy.
I own all of the Viking reprints of the first four Dark Tower books. The copy of the Waste Lands that I purchased says Viking on the spine and on the book jacket but on the copyright page it says it was published by Plume. It does say that it was printed in 2003 simultaneously with a Viking edition or something along those lines. I realize Plume and Viking were both part of Penguin Publishing but I was just curious if the copy I purchased is less desirable than one by Viking. It looks identical and again even has Viking on the spine and dust jacket. I thought that was strange and couldn't find anything on the net about it. Any knowledge on this would be appreciated. Thanks
Here are some pictures. Also there is no price on the inside of the dust jacket. Were there book club editions of these?

Induction Heating Assisted Foam Mat Drying of Papaya Pulp: Drying Kinetics, drying modeling, and Effects on Quality Attributes
The study was focused on investigating the drying kinetics, drying modeling and quality parameters of induction heating assisted foam mat dried papaya pulp powder. Variable parameters in induction drying were induction voltage (150, 175 and 200 V) at 100º C and foam-mat thickness (4, 6 and 8 mm). Both the independent variables had a pronounced effect on drying characteristics of papaya pulp foam. For comparison, 6mm thick foam was dried at 100º C air temperature. Seven drying models were fitted to obtain the models that fit best. The selection of model was done on the basis of certain statistical parameters. Midilli-Kucuk Model was found to be the best in all cases except at thickness 6 mm and 200 V where Wang and Sing model exhibited best results. Effect of drying parameters on properties of reconstituted papaya pulp powder was studied by applying face-centered design of response surface methodology. Modified quadratic models were significant at p≤0.05 for pH, Vitamin C, total sugar, reducing sugar and TSS, but not for color change. The optimum values of input voltage and foam-mat thickness were 150 V and 8 mm, respectively which would yield dried papaya powder of pH 4.6; reducing sugar 3.55%; ascorbic acid 126.42 mg/100 mL; color change 10.26 with desirability 0.889.

12 Abstract: The drawing technique, of fundamental importance in any engineering modality, motivated the creation of the Descriptive Geometry and Technical Drawing. Inside the discipline there is the teaching of the perpective drawing technique, that aims to aproximate a tridimensional object by a bidimensional representation. With this, this article aims to do a description of the aplication of practical activity to the civil engineering students from Unioeste by theacher Marta de Siqueira. The activity consists in drawing a real object using the isometric and cavalier perspective. To draw the perspectives, the studen guides himself by the real object and by their orthogonal cylindrical projections. As a result, the work of two students is pressented, each one representing an objetct in two perspectives. By the end of activity, it is observed that the two techniques are similar, however, the isometric perspective has more aplications in engineering than the cavalier perspective, because it is drawned with real measures facilitating the procces of materials budgeting, in case the objet is a structure. Beyond that, it is concluded that this activity is of great importance to the development of spacial perception in graphical representation in students, one of the most important skills of engineers. Key-words: Descriptive geometry, Isometric perspective, Cavalier perspective, Orthogonal cylindrical projections.
Don't forget that next week is National Fire Prevention Week!! October 7-13!During National Fire Prevention Week, October 7 - 13, 2012 attention is focused on promoting fire safety and prevention, however we should practice fire safety all year long. Many potential fire hazards go undetected because people simply do not take steps to fireproof their home. Many bedroom fires are caused by misuse or poor maintenance of electrical devices, careless use of candles, smoking in bed, and children playing with matches and lighters. Most potential hazards can be addressed with a little common sense. For example, be sure to keep flammable items like bedding, clothes and curtains at least three feet away from portable heaters or lit candles, and never smoke in bed. Also, items like appliances or electric blankets should not be operated if they have frayed power cords, and electrical outlets should never be overloaded. Fire Safety Checklist: Install and maintain a working smoke alarm outside of every sleep area and remember to change the battery at least once a year. Designate two escape routes from each bedroom and practice them regularly. Teach everyone the "Stop, Drop, and Roll" technique in case clothing catches on fire.

Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
This Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (the "Policy") is incorporated by reference into your Registration Agreement, and sets forth the terms and conditions in connection with a dispute between you and any party other than DropCatch1544 (the registrar) over the registration and use of an Internet domain name registered by you.
By applying to register a domain name, or by asking DropCatch1544 to maintain or renew a domain name registration, you hereby represent and warrant to DropCatch1544 that (a) the statements that you made in your Registration Agreement are complete and accurate; (b) that to the best of your knowledge, the registration of the domain name will not infringe upon or otherwise violate the rights of any third party; (c) you are not registering the domain name for an unlawful or malicious purpose; and (d) you will not knowingly use the domain name in violation of any applicable laws or regulations. DropCatch1544 does not check to verify that your domain registration is legal. It is your responsibility to determine, whether your domain name registration infringes or violates someone else's rights.
a.In certain situations, DropCatch1544's receipt of written or appropriate electronic instructions from you or your authorized agent to take such action;
b.Receipt of an order from a court or arbitral tribunal with proper jurisdiction, ICANN, Verisign, or other appropriate authority, requiring such action;
c.Receipt of a decision of an Administrative Panel requiring such action in any administrative proceeding to which you were a party (as explained in detail below); and/or
d.To comply with the resolution of a dispute concerning your domain name under another registrar's domain name dispute resolution policy that is identical to this policy in all material respects.
DropCatch1544 may also cancel, transfer or otherwise make changes to a domain name registration in accordance with the terms of your Registration Agreement, other legal requirements, or for any reason DropCatch1544 deems necessary.
By registering any domain with DropCatch1544.com you submit that such domain name(s) will be participate in the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy that is described and mandated by ICANN. This policy and procedure is outlined and explained here: https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/dndr-2012-02-25-en These proceedings will be conducted before one of the administrative dispute resolution service providers listed at http://www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm ("Providers"). Per ICANN's UDRP policies:
a.Applicable Disputes - You are required to submit to a mandatory UDRP administrative proceeding in the event that a third party (a "complainant") asserts to the applicable Provider, in compliance with that Provider's rules of procedure, that (i) your domain name is identical or misleadingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; and (ii) you have no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; and (iii) your domain name has been registered and is being used in bad faith.
b.Evidence of Registration and Use in Bad Faith - For the purposes of Paragraph 4(a)(iii), the following, in particular but without limitation, shall be evidence of the registration and use of a domain name in bad faith: (i) offer to sell, rent or otherwise transfer the domain name registration to the complainant who is the owner of the trademark or service mark or to a competitor of that complainant, for valuable consideration; or (ii) your attempt to attract, for financial gain, Internet users to your website or other on-line location, by creating confusion with the trademark or service mark of the complainant; or (iii) your registration of a domain name in order to prevent the owner of the trademark or service mark from reflecting the mark in a corresponding domain name, provided that a pattern of such conduct has been established on your part; or (iv) your registration of a domain name in order to disrupt the business of a competitor.
c.Selection of Provider - The Provider who will administer a particular proceeding shall be selected by the complainant.
d.Initiation of Proceeding and Process - Each Provider's rules of procedure state the process for initiating and conducting a proceeding and for selecting the panel that will decide the dispute (the "Administrative Panel"). The rules of procedure for each Provider appear at http://www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm.
e.Consolidation - In the event of multiple disputes between you and a complainant, either you or the complainant may petition to consolidate the disputes before a single Administrative Panel. This petition shall be made to the first Administrative Panel selected to hear a pending dispute between the parties. This Administrative Panel may consolidate before it all such disputes in its sole discretion, provided that (i) such domain name registrations are governed by a domain name dispute resolution policy identical to this Policy in all material respects; and (ii) all of the disputes are before Providers listed at http://www.icann.org/udrp/approved-providers.htm.
f.Fees - All fees incurred in connection with any dispute before an Administrative Panel pursuant to this Policy shall be paid as set forth in the relevant Provider's rules of procedure.
g.DropCatch1544 Involvement in Administrative Proceedings - DropCatch1544 does not and will not participate in the administration or conduct of any proceeding before an Administrative Panel. In addition, DropCatch1544 will not be liable as a result of any decisions rendered by the Administrative Panel.
i.Notification and Publication - The Provider shall notify DropCatch1544 of any decision made by one of its Administrative Panels with respect to a domain name you have registered with the Registrar. All decisions under this Policy will be published over the Internet, except when an Administrative Panel determines in its sole discretion not to have its decision published.
j.Availability of Court Proceedings - The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded. If an Administrative Panel decides that your domain name registration should be cancelled or transferred, DropCatch1544 will wait ten (10) business days after being informed by the applicable Provider of the Administrative Panel's decision before implementing that decision. DropCatch1544 will then implement the decision unless it has received from you during such ten (10) business day period a copy of a complaint, file-stamped by the clerk of the court, against the complainant regarding your right to use your domain name. If DropCatch1544 receives such a complaint, it will not implement the Administrative Panel's decision, and it will take no further action, until (i) DropCatch1544 is informed of a resolution between the parties; (ii) DropCatch1544 is informed that your lawsuit has been dismissed or withdrawn; or (iii) DropCatch1544 receives a copy of an order from such court dismissing your lawsuit or ordering that you do not have the right to continue to use your domain name.

DropCatch1544 will not participate in any way in any dispute between you and any third-party regarding the registration and use of your domain name(s). You shall not name DropCatch1544 as a party or otherwise include DropCatch1544 in any such proceeding. In the event that DropCatch1544 is named as a party in any such proceeding, DropCatch1544 reserves the right to raise any and all defenses deemed appropriate, and to take any other action necessary to defend the company.

DropCatch1544 reserves the right to cancel any transfer of a domain name registration to another holder that is made in violation of this provision.
b.Changing Registrars - You may not transfer your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending administrative proceeding brought pursuant to the UDRP Policy or for a period of fifteen (15) calendar days after such proceeding is concluded. You may transfer administration of your domain name registration to another registrar during a pending court action or arbitration, provided that (i) the domain name you have registered with DropCatch1544 shall continue to be subject to the proceedings commenced against you in accordance with the terms of this Policy and if permitted by the relevant authority; and (ii) the new registrar has a domain name dispute policy under which it will recognize and implement any decision rendered in any such proceeding. In the event you transfer a domain name registration to DropCatch1544 during the pendency of a court action or arbitration, such dispute shall remain subject to the domain name dispute policy of the registrar from which the domain name registration was transferred.
DropCatch1544 reserves the right to modify this Policy at any time. All revisions to this Policy will be posted at http://www.namebright.com/disputepolicy.aspx when it becomes effective. Unless this Policy has already been invoked, in which event the version of the Policy in effect at the time it was invoked will apply to you until the dispute is over, all such changes will be binding upon you with respect to any domain name registration dispute, whether the dispute arose before, on or after the effective date of the change.
Should you object to a change in this Policy, your sole remedy is to cancel your domain name registration or transfer your domain name registration to another registrar, provided that in the event of a transfer, you will not be entitled to a refund of any fees you paid to DropCatch1544. The revised Policy will apply to you until you cancel or transfer your domain name registration.

Format/Rules The 2001 tourney was the best DA BUT yet. A combination of sunny fall weather, competitive play, intermittent boat races, and bbqing cemented DA BUT's reputation as the premier beach ultimate tournament in the Washington, DC metro region.
After a morning of tough play, GHUT, Team Schaeffer, Petra, and Monkey Love Potion advanced to the semis. A determined Schaeffer squad upended the infamous GHUT team and advanced to the finals. On the other side, Monkey Love Potion, in a come-from-behind desperation move, challenged Petra to a boat race. The underdog drinkers, Petra, held firm, winning the boat race and advancing to the finals. The many fans in attendance witnessed a classic showdown between two well-balanced teams. With daylight fading, it came down to a next point wins situation, and Schaeffer didn't disappoint.
Yesterday we presented the Homeless Children’s Playtime Project with a check for $90,000, the proceeds of our fundraising efforts. It was the largest donation they’ve ever received and allowed them to hire their first volunteer coordinator, Deborah Sherman. It also granted them the ability to expand their program to the hotels that are housing the overflow from DC General. N Street Village and FAIR Girls both received $5000.00 as part of the DC Wise legacy program. We are so proud to have helped these groups in 2016! We’re also grateful for your support. It would not be possible without you!

Multivariable systems are generally and encountered in real industrial processes due to the complexity, resulting in increased number of loop controls to maintain the quantity and quality of industrial productions. The industrial processes include petrochemical industry, oil and gas industry, refinery industry, cement industry, power plants, etc. Recently, the development of science and technology generate many types of controllers, nevertheless the PID controller still has an important role in the industrial processes because it has several advantages such as robust performance in various range of operating conditions and simple to utilize. Hence, the engineer can easily operate and also appropriately controlling the process. However, the process of finding the best PID tuning parameters is still a major problem in performing PID controller tuning. Over the years, various methods have been developed to perform PID tuning controls on multivariable systems which has been categorized into 6 groups, detuning, sequential loop closing, iterative or trial-and-error, simultaneous equation solving, independent and optimization methods. Certainly, each method has its own advantages and disadvantages in generating the best PID controller parameters.
In order to support resolving the issue, Department of Engineering Physics, Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS) Surabaya, Indonesia as a pioneer in instrumentation and control study invites students from all over the world to take part in developing a method to perform PID controller tuning on a multivariable system in a competition called IPCC (International Process Control Competition). IPCC is an international competition about the process control in relation to solve the multivariable system tuning issue which is intended to university students. The competition includes the modelling and identification of a multivariable system to determine PID tuning parameters (Kp, Ti, and Td). Hence, the competition topics include problem formulation, modelling and identification system, tuning methods, and optimization algorithms.

There is something to be said about my love for sundresses. The obsession started since I could dress myself, well actually since I could point at the dresses and say "mine!" When Spirit 75 Boutique reached out to collaborate of course I was delighted. They are such a trendy, boho, unique boutique that just makes you spend hours upon hours browsing around... especially drooling over dresses.
I recently did a little spring cleaning with my closet and tossed all the clothes that haven't passed the "must wear in 2 years to be saved" rule. After I cleared out a large portion I organized the rest and quickly noticed that I had a lack of clothing that were prints, most of the items are solid plain colors. Bors and snors if you as me! Mission add more prints to my wardrobe was a success when I found this geometric dress at Spirit 75. The colors are perfect for this season & the dress is flattering on its own or even layered under a jacket or vest!

In this 3D representation of the relationship between collaboration and mean citation impact in the Longwood Medical Area, each building’s height reflects the number of citations of papers originating in the building, while the color gradient (from gray/low to blue/high) represents the proportion of publications originating from that building in which both first and last authors work in the building.
Chatting around the water cooler may yield more than office gossip; it may help scientists produce better research, according to Harvard Medical School (HMS) investigators.
The benefits of collaboration are well accepted in the scientific world, but researchers with the HMS Center for Biomedical Informatics wondered whether physical proximity affects the quality of those collaborations: Do scientists who have more “face time” with colleagues produce higher-impact results? To test the hypothesis, they examined data from 35,000 biomedical science papers published between 1999 and 2003, each with at least one Harvard author. The articles appeared in 2,000 journals and involved 200,000 authors.
After analyzing the number of citations each paper generated (a standard way to gauge article quality) and the distances between coauthors, they concluded that personal contact, especially between an article’s first and last authors, still matters—even in an age of e-mail, social networking, and video conferencing. (Their analysis, “Does Collocation Inform the Impact of Collaboration?” appeared in the online journal PLoS ONE in December.)
“Our data show that if the first and last authors are physically close, they get cited more, on average,” says research assistant Kyungjoon Lee. As that distance grew, citations generally declined. (Typically, the first author is a graduate student or postdoctoral fellow and the last is a more senior faculty member; they are often affiliated with the same lab, but do not necessarily work closely together.) The effect didn’t hold true for other author combinations, such as first and third; in fact, the middle authors normally don’t interact much on a project, Lee notes. The team also found that, on average, a paper with four or fewer authors based in the same building was cited 45 percent more than one with authors in different buildings—“So if you put people who have the potential to collaborate close together,” he says, “it might lead to better results.”
Roy Cargo Pants Black Trendy Size Rachel Plus Satin RACHEL Lee was first author on the study; the principal investigator was center co-director Isaac Kohane, the Henderson professor of pediatrics and health sciences and technology. Kohane had long suspected that proximity promotes collaboration, despite a lack of hard evidence, so he secured funding and recruited Lee and others for the study.
Gathering data was much harder than Lee expected. A team of 15 undergraduates used floor plans, staff directories, and their feet to track down the specific office and laboratory addresses of the 7,300 Harvard authors across several Harvard campuses and Massachusetts General Hospital, as well as addresses for the non-Harvard scientists included in the study. Then they built a three-dimensional image of authors’ locations, calculated the distances separating them, and evaluated the relationship between citations and distances.
More research is needed to explain why proximity seems to enhance scientific productivity, the group says, but Lee knows firsthand the difference it can make. Early on, he worked on the fourth floor of Countway Library, while Kohane was one flight above. Eventually, Kohane moved to Lee’s floor, and the two wound up chatting a lot in the center’s kitchenette. “I became more active in exchanging ideas because of this experience,” Lee recalls. “Science is all about communicating your ideas so others can build on them.”

For many years I have been a supporter of the Dominica Labour Party. My household and I have always voted them. But we have come to realize that this new DLP doesn’t stand for what we believe and moreover the country could have been more advanced and this since before Maria. I am not a diasporan, I am right here In Dominica. I believe it’s time for a change in Dominica. We need a break from this DLP government. So I have been thinking which one? I don’t trust the DFP. I don’t like the UWP.
I repeat I don’t like the UWP but I love Dominica. And this time around a vote for change is a vote for Dominica.
Now let me get to the real reason for this letter. I am one but the voice of many. I have listened to fellow Labourites who want change like me; I have listened to Labourites who are blinded by their love for their PM or some who just think that the country is okay how it is. I have also listened to the UWP supporters. And they all make sense in their own way.
They all say the same thing: the Opposition Leader needs to make some changes to his personality if the party wants to win the election.
Mr. Opposition leader you need to step down to the level of the people. You need to give the people what they want.
1. Smile for those around you. You will make your supporters happy and you might just gain someone from the other parties. Charm them with your smile.
3. Go out there find out which of the elderly that’s not being taken care of and help them. You don’t need much. The diaspora is with you. They will help you. If you can help at least 2 people from each constituency that would be great.
4. Undertake a project to fix at least one road (the people are playing ignorant nowadays, they know that’s not the role of the opposition but that’s what they want).
5. Stop focusing on corruption. Some people care but most don’t – especially as long as they are getting a little something, or hope to.
6. Get someone else in the party to talk about corruption and to expose the government. But YOU focus on what your party will do for people and how they will be better off and happier with you.
7. Take trips to get investors and friends of Dominica, not to waste your time talking about the PM.
8. You are an intelligent man, even more than the PM himself – and he knows it. That’s why he’ll never debate you one on one. The people are saying you have no education. Well do a bachelor’s degree in political science online or whatever and let the people know you are doing it.
9. Meet the young people both in home and on the block. Greet them. Talk with them. Find ideas from them. The youth have great vision.
10. Have more charisma. Don’t be scared to shake hands with people. Listen to the voice of the people not Workers alone, but all the people of Dominica.
11. Go out meet the common man on the street, by the bay etc… Educate them. Those that are already educated have made up their mind already. They are either for or against corruption. But the common man and the uneducated need to be educated. Meet the forgotten ones, the poor farmer who are trying to make ends meet.
12. Do what it takes to convince the people who want nothing to do with Labour anymore but who you haven’t been able to convince to vote for your party.”
14. Try to get your team to plan some activities in their constituency. For example game night, BBQ, sporting activities etc.
If uwp executive team had any sense or strategy in their blood they would have asked the new party leader to lead us to victory. The lady is smart and very diplomatic. Linton is linton that serious booway face not working for workers. Joshua and her i believe can landslide the next election. I keep following her and like her or not thats our winning card. I give her plenty pressure but she can handle herself . Remember she is very like-able. Trust i met her she sweet. We have to be real we cannot afford to lose another election. Mark my words without her coming on board i not seeing a win for us straight up
Yadi yadi yada. Can you change the spots on a zebra?! Can you remove the dimples of from Skerrit’s face? I say this to say that; Lennox will and should remain Lennox. Why should he pretend to be a people’s person when he is not! My only concern is that when placed in government he and the UWP team need to live up to the expectations of the people in terms of providing jobs and placing Dominica on the “Map” etc. Trump came in as a little arrogant person and guess what?! many did not approved of him but he won! right? he won the election and is now the President of the USA.
FINALLY! A labourite who has seen the LIGHT! This person is speaking 100% truth. I myself am a freedomite….from back in the day…not the current DFP. Nonetheless, I am a Dominican. And opposition leader really needs to do1 of 2 things…step up his game as mentioned above…or please…step down. And give another member of opposition the job. Full stop.
What if he doesn’t will the likes of u put the dlp back in power. We need to get this govt out then five years down the road think about that other stuff . It is just a distraction right now
No offense but this comes across as someone who is trying to get information. Take it for what it is a letter to DNO.
You are a student this is the type of advice you give to the candidate contesting your village council or at your high school. NICE TRY A FOR EFFORT.
Number 2 gave you away. This is why we have Public relations people happy go lucky at constituency level. What constituency are you from see what goes on with the representatives of the different parties. Your parliamentary representative or potential is your direct line of focus there.
I am in full agreement with the writer. Very well written and Lennox and the UWP crew had better take note. Anything else and they will wallow in the wilderness.
Every election DLP cheating by spending five times the money of the uwp and bringing overseas voters no amount of advice to uwp can change that.
UWP gained three crucial seats in the last elections. No one believed UWP would achieve this under the professional leadership of Hon. Linton.
I know that there is some level of fear that the failed Skerrit corrupt labour party will get back in government, but it is not going to happen. Those who are asking for Hon Linton to be more smiling, let us focus on promoting the UWP as a decent and focussed change for Domininca to be in office under the leadership and team of the professional Hon Linton & his Able Team. We Dominicans must stop being personal and focus on what we want for Domininca and which party is more sincere & professional to achieve this under sincere professional Linton.
Hon Linton is trustworthy, has a brilliant team nd those who complain of Linton must be out there giving the smiles, hopes, encouragement and education to be our people to vote UWP, for good governance. Hon Linton is an exceptionally disciplined, honest and focussed man with the interest of Dominica.
Yes DLP and Skerro must go, but LL clearly does not possess the natural persona or strategic ability to lead Dominica.
Even if he wins he will be an arrogant leader. UWP needs a new leader now, which many in the UWP leadership are clearly aware of and voiced in closed circles.
The person who claim because they want change, no longer wish to support Labor, is a very dangerous person and a liar!
If you wanted to launch a personal attack on Lennox you should simply do so and spare us your lies and hogwash; in the first place you cannot be a diasporan, I do not believe there is any such person; nevertheless: “I am a Dominican living in the diaspora; and that could be any place in the world!”
Personality is define as the quality and state of being an individual person in existence, it is the condition or fact of relating to a particular person specifically, we are born with our personality. You are suggesting that Lennox is a disparaging hustle person therefore he must change his personality.
You hate Lennox because he has exposed Roosevelt corruption; such as money that was misappropriated to buy the trash bin of which the greater part went into the pockets of the crooks involved.
Amen Francisco, Amen,, Tell them. They are scared of Hon Linton and protect the mismanagement and bobol of Skerrit’s government.
Mr Telemarque I must admit that while reading the comments I was specifically looking forward to reading yours since I have always read your input under other people ‘s post. I was very disappointed when you started by calling me a liar and an enemy. I thought you were a wise man that could detect sincerity but I guess I was wrong.
I am just someone who listens to people. And whether some people like it or not this is what people have been saying . You all need to respect people’s opinion. Some people look for different things in a leader. First impression is a lasting one for some people.
Therefore sir you are accusation has no basis. This is the problem with some grown people on both sides you all are quick to call each other hurtful names.
Yes I was a favourite. Yes I am disappointed in my party. Yes I want change. And a bote for uwp is a vote for change.
The personality of someone is something which they are born with; that cannot be change. If we are dealing with someone who has a learent habit; such as stealing, smoking a violent wife beater, or let’s says thief thief.
A violent person, or a thief can seek help (psychological help; therapy) which might help them break such bad habit!
Nevertheless, when you say to me I need to change my personality, it would be like telling me I need to change my phenotype (my face or the appearance of my face) which is my face which is my God given! So, my facial expressions is part of my personality, and that cannot change.
Case and point, in 1964 I returned to Dominic, and worked for J Astaphans briefly, I drove around in a van, always looking serious the van broke down, Johnny sent me to guy to have it repaired the man began speaking to when I responded said “aa” you are different than the way you appear.
Let me say to the author of the open letter,I appreciate you reading my comments, and I wish you continue; however, try and not to be over sensitive, because once you are involve in to politics, even your friend, brother or sisters may say something to you or about you that you do not like.
The worst thing one can do is take a political comment personal: Even if I say you are a liar, and an enemy of the nation, that does not have to be true:
If you know you are sincere you should not worry about what I said; but whereas I know I am a loose canon, perhaps you can find a way to change you rhetoric a bit where it pertains to the leader of the opposition, in reality perhaps you do not like the fact that Lennox seldom smile, that does not make him a bad person.
The UWP needs to position themselves as the “Alternate Party” and not the “Opposition Party”. They are failing in this regard. They need to give Dominicans something to vote for not just vote against.
I am a very strong supporter of UWP and I must say I am in full agreement, though I strongly disagree with point # 3, 4 and 5. But generally speaking I believe it’s a fair letter that can only make Mr. Linton a better person and more likeable. No doubt Mr. Linton has what Dominica needs at this time but he needs to work hard on winning those that hate him. I know him and love the man to death but I must say I feel a way when he walks right next to me without saying high to me and others. I Know he has said that he is a work in progress but Hon. Linton for the sake of Dominica please start to connect with people ASAP. Please let’s make ourselves like others to win them for the sake of Dominica. I know you are not fresh or copawayzon so you can do it! I believe it’s more shyness than anything but please overcome it. Start tomorrow Sir. Make it your goal to stop by and shake the hand of at least ten persons you never met before. We are all in it together and we play to win!
SO NOW YOU BEGGING the NOVICE to change his attitude. Only now you see that man is not a peoples’ person? Only now you realize how selfish this leader of yours is? Very concited and thinks he is above everyone else. If he was a handsome guy one would well imagine the Earth would be too small for him to walk on.
Personally, I see nothing wrong with honourable Lintons demeanour.I agree that he is way ahead of the current PM in terms of intellect .What is shocking to me is the lackluster attitude of our people towards their country,and its direction.In which other country people vote for handshakes or dimples?
One of the main reasons ROSS left is because of all the hate, violence, and destructiopn this guy is preaching and spreading in the country. People fear for their lives so they have no choice but to leave the country.
My friend it’s not based on what you think or not because people like you and I will vote Mr. Linton everyday ahead of that corrupt and disgraceful Skerrit. But we need to help others, especially laborites come over. Being friendly will not hurt him or uwp or Dominica. We will all benefit. We need to learn to play the people game, to win some. It is a fact that some people vote personality, while some vote party and others vote for country. If we understand that and plan on winning those that vote personality and party it will only help us deliver Dominica from the deep shit Skerrit has our beautiful country in. I am hearing a lot that not only with laborites but also uwpites and in constituencies we carry.
Dominicans do not learn. They are aware what the young dimpled man did to that country, but they want another beauty to run the country. Why don’t they go tell the management of Ross to come back to Dominica, because Dominica is famous for producing the most handsome and charismatic men in politics in the Caribbean, who knows, maybe they might come back.
No bro you are wrong. We know Skerrit the deciever uses his dimple to fool the people. But right now our country is in deep …. and we need those who have been fooled by Skerrit to come over to help us deliver Dominica from our oppressor and therefore I, a loyal supporter of UWP call upon Hon. Linton to put aside his shyness and any sense of rejection he might be battling with for the sake of our country. I call of those around him to help him overcome. These are qualities our good leader ought to add to his humility, honesty, faithfulness, love for country etc according to 2 Peter 1:5-9. I love Mr. Linton and pray for him daily but he sure would help my prayers get answered if he would take my advice.
It would have been best if the writer had face Lennox and talk to him instead of PRETENDING commenting under the name of a LABORITE. You claim to hate UWP, THEN WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO VOTE FOR THEM?
Who so ever you are(UWPITE) GOOD ADVICE to your Leader. Hope he listens to you because this guy is a nusense and a nonsense opposition leader that thinks of only PERSONAL POWER. HE HAS NO LOVE in his heart for others. He is distruction. He is greedy, fierce and self centered.
You are so stupid..so, you are saying that a Labourite on the verge of changing cannot write this; if he/she is concern about these traits/attitudes in the Opposition leader? Please, note in democracies; people who once support the ruling party are the easiest to shift alliance.
I am not voting for a personality but for Dominica, that needs changes and right now Lennox Linto is the right man for the job . He is no kisser of babies or passing the time of day just saying pleasantries but he will get the job done that is needed right now. Enough respect.
I think it is good, neutral advice. I am an objective person and I agree that the opposition leader needs to step up and be more positive and approachable.
But even more than that, we Dominicans who feel UWP is weak, need to join them and support others to join them so they can be strong. I am ready for something new. Over 18 years is too long for any party – we need to keep governments on their toes and changing them when they least expect it is one way. And yes I voted for both UWP and DLP before.
Good letter, but how can it convince me. Remember when they changed Bird in Antigua. Remember when Trump supporters ask for change because his attitude would change to presidential nature . Remember the saying put a hog in a palace …. about the spots on a leapod .A negative and violent attitude is just like a river flowing away from the sea towards the mountain. It cannot change.
I wonder where the UWP leaders were hiding, what did they do to help re Maria, Cat 5. I guess they do not know the meaning of “MOBILIZE ”
DLP supports can identify with the ideology of their party. Opposition forces have no ideology , and bashing them will not change them.
DLP the only party that have been stoned (violently) out of office. The are the only ones who suffered the Sankey Song, split twice, came back after twenty years . So you think they do not have the experience to defend…
Having read this open letter through a number of times I am still unclear what it is really about. Is it a personality thing between parties? It must be me?
Simple Wayne. It is a clever and devious attempt by Skerrit operatives to create discord in the opposition.
Lennox is an intellectual politician more interested in winning debates and debates over everything than in real politics. For example in the case of Ross instead of pushing hard on the failure of Skerrit and that he should now move aside he gets trapped in debating with cronies about who is responsible, why Ross went away and what led to it. Who cares. Skerrit lost Ross and he must be made to pay should be the undiluted message nothing else. If UWP is to win elections the lazy senators other than Baptiste must show their mettle on the ground.
Mr Williams…they have nothing to show. They have no track records of positive things that they have done for anyone. Nothing from nothing equals nothing, but fake news. Both for Erica and Maria they were M.I A, Now they are trying to weaponize the departure of Ross because they have nothing to offer.
You are a coward why didn’t sign your name instead of concern citizen. I think you are a UWP who wants Lennox change but asking alot. Good luck,
Let mr Francis lead the UWP.. I have confidence that he’ll give the dlp a whooping… Alot of people what change but don’t see lennox capable enough to represent them..
All I want is a Change for my Country. I have the conviction that Lennox Linton has the interest of Dominica at heart. He seems genuine to me and we need to give him that chance to prove himself. We have seen this DLP Leader and his style of Governance…he is not true to the people and the country. He is only there to stay in power and keep the people waiting on empty promises. It is time for a CHange in our beautiful country.
It is sad to see how this GOvernment has failed us. It is disheartening to see how they do it with no conscious. Whenever there seems to be some unsavory issues, they send their ambassadors and soffisticated lawyers to slant the truth and fool the people. This is wrong and this must end now!!!
Your sentiment on being in the OPPOSITION and finally gaining sense to realise that Dominica really needs change – don’t add up; you haven’t given no reasonable or credible explanation for it. Being an effective ‘steward’ as PM of a country has little to do with personality. In a political process it involves balancing competing influences and demands. It will include:
4. Regulating the behaviour of a wide range of actors – from political advisers to cabinet ministers; and
In today’s world, the primary competence needed by any LEADER / POTENTIAL LEADER to grow a Country’s economy is (item 5) listed above. Personality aside, only HON LENNOX LINTON can guarantee you such quality – a…
At this time Dominica needs change and an effective leader should know which leadership quality, strategy and characteristics are required at the right time and now we need change. I totally agree that “an effective ‘steward’ as PM of a country has little to do with personality” however, it appears to be critical to many of the voters. That is why Roosevelt Skerrit continues to win, because he has not demonstrated any of the five points you listed above.
This is politics, not economics or a university class. That is the problem or rather challenge the of the UWP is faced with. They want to do it right but that has proven very very difficult as we have seen over the years. Having won the election, the party will have to being the process of reeducating the population to vote on issues. I am very confident that they can achieve that, but greatest concern is getting in.
Ignorance is a curse among D/cans, in the eyes of economic performance. Here’s setting the record straight on what in your own “tunnelled” world equates to this misnomer, since the threshold set by the Caribbean monetary union is 5% annual GDP growth.. To give you an insight, here’s some hard evidence on Dominica’s dismal economic performance in Real GDP Growth (Annual Percentage Change), since 2001, as it continues to deny the citizens of a reasonable “STANDARD OF LIVING” – according to the IMF:
I seem to do it regularly, educating Dominicans like you to quell your ignorance. Now, you said… “This is politics, not economics or a university class”. It’s a good thing when my mother sent me to school I never slept in class to deny myself absorbing any knowledge. Therefore, sit down open you eyes wide and internalise (if you’ve got the ability to do so) this little teaching from me:
Politics and economics go hand in hand. From politics point of view economics are tools, for economic point of view politics are tools. So “the most important” is a matter of point of view. For capital owners politics are means to gain more capital, for politicians, capitals are means to gain more power. As sciences, both political sciences and economic sciences are social sciences, and they’ve got more or less the same end-goal, to provide society with a framework for efficient development.
Hi Concern Dominican, this is not a beat-up thing. The point I want to highlight is about winning an election, not running the country. You must first win the election before you can run the country. Economic advisers will draft economic plan to be presented to the electorates but the party can’t implement these plans unless they have won the election. The UWP has always presented much better economic plans than the DLP, yet they lost the last 2 elections. While “imported voters” had an impact, it appears than these economic plans were not properly sold to the voters on the ground. Back to my initial point, the party MUST improve their PR/communication strategy. Bty, thanks for the ECON101 class. Actually Dr. Fontaine was my first econ lecturer before i moved on to 401 .
@Concern Dominican. Im not even reading your entire comment just the first line and i know you are senseless. The above article was perfectly written and everything that was said above ive thought of it in the past and said the very same thing. GREAT MIND THINK ALIKE. Im a strong labor supporter and if only Lennox Linton changes his attitude, maybe he just might get my vote.
The Dominican public at large needs to change its attitude. This dependency syndrome in Government, which renders the majority of you defunct, unable to be enterprising and elevate yourselves in an evolving world of science and innovation is what impoverishing Dominica. This junk food phenomenon that sees average Dominicans unwilling to work the soil, and a growing appetite for the best clothes, cars and luxury quality goods without a means of income or servicing your debts remains the cancer among this new breed / generation of Dominicans. My only advice to you is the measure your own contribution towards D/ca’s prosperity for a level of self-satisfaction, as opposed to playing Party colours. I’ve satisfied myself by doing my bit and can now say no more under this corrupt regime.
I respect the views of the write but he/she has to remember Lennox is a human being and to be a honest politician has to maintain some part of his authentic nature. I believe personally he has made some changes in his personality since becoming a politician but better can also be done in the area on more community work on the ground.
But I would go further and say on personality ” IRON Lady” PM Eugene Charles was no different from Lennox in terms of been personable and we loved her dearly because Dominica came first.
Wonderful …. The Iron Lady, first female PM in the Caribbean was NOT a very socialable person…. hardly ever smiled but was all for economic growth in Dominica!
Sorry. But there is a difference in not smiling and being personable. The Iron Lady did not smile much and was not always Grinning her her teef!!! however she was very personable! She was for the people! She loved the people and the people loved her back! There will never be another Iron Lady!!! best prime minister in the history of Dominica!!! if we could only have a prime minister with 1/2 the values, tenacity and motivation as Dame Eugenia Charles we would be a much better country! And she for sure would not be selling off the people’s land And tainting the sacred Land of the cabrits as you see today! The curent state of dominica is DISGRACEFUL!!! THE LOSS OF ROSS, CBI….ALL OF IT, HUGE DISGRACE.
Fist of all, this letter was written by a UWP supporter so lets stop the SCL propaganda. Second of all, the UWP needs a new leader, period!! There is absolutely no was they can win under the current leadership. They are trying to gain some grounds on the ROSS issues but they are falling flat on their faces.
Mr St Jean….please allow me…. Because Linton has the gift of gab he did very well last election. A new face, his first try, six seats after filing 21candidates. Great job. If he was a serious leader he would have endeavored to get some members of the DLP side to cross the floor. In stead he became a basher of everyone. He did not see the need to inform himself of the procedure and rules o the house (self education), instead bashed the speaker with accusation of bias.
As a member of the house he could have bought issues to the house in a statesmanship manner, instead he took them to the streets in campaign mode.
He has been bashing the DLP for diplomatic passport issue, only to use one to crash a heads of government conference in Guyana. Was on CNN blasting the C B I program now he is saying HOW he can use it. The list can continue with walkouts, boycotts, quittings and demonstrations, and inciting hatred and violence. Leading on a path to destruction like a judass goat.
tome, you fail,, We will not change our leader, Change yours, because ours is getting stronger whice yours is fading, The next step from down is up, And the next step from up is down, From 3 to six cannot be going down, Only in labourites mathematics , And from 18 to 15 ,cannot be going up, Only in labourites maths also, And this is why I do not like labour, Because their mathematics turns people into fools
If Skerrit’s smile and fake Charismatic charade could develop Dominica we would already be the best place to Live, Work and Enjoy Life, but sadly it takes way more, and a level of seriousness such as what Mr. Linton brings to build a country.
Linton will come around to the smiles and chatter when the time comes..Mamo was also a serious person that cared about country and she showed it everywhere.
Linton also cares about Dominica and it’s people and it shows with the personal sacrifices he has made over the years to stand for truth and justice. If Skerrit remains in Dominica even half a term in Opposition I think would eventually be deserving of the Doctorate he purchased. Highly unlike that will happen though..the people who cares don’t necessarily have to smile and fool people with charisma.
Is this a joke, ” The people are saying you have no education. Well do a bachelor’s degree in political science online or whatever and let the people know you are doing it.” Good luck with that one….
I will admit upfront that I am a support of UWP. I really hope Mr. Linton take note of the points in this letter. Mr. Linton, you may think, you’re doing all what is being suggested by the author, but it is obvious many people do not think so. If you dismiss this letter because you think there is no more you can do, then you would have failed Dominica. It is very obvious that people want change and you and the UWP seams to be the alternative, so their is that extra burden on you to deny yourself for the sake of country. Just for a moment listen to these advise.
When I speak to people even before the departure of RUSM, I was getting excited about a UWP government, then they would say UWP have no ideas. I know the UWP have ideas, I have heard them over and over again. But the party have not found away to communicate their plans to their non-supporters. The party MUST invest in improving it’s PR/Communication ahead of the next election if you stand a chance. It’s a MUST…
What this letter is saying, is literally the opinions of near 70% of the electorate. People are voting, not for leaders but against bad leaders. That’s the mistake Linton makes, he believed the added votes to UWP from the last elections was from people who loved him, it was from people who got fed up of Skerrit. He is Dominica’s Hillary Clinton.
Of all the suggestions, number 8 stands out for me. Linton as an individual never saw it fit to progress himself academically. Not only that, even in his position, he was ignorant enough to believe he can be respected in this day and age without even a high school diploma. To me the fact that after 5 years as UWP leader, and he never progressed just shows his level of ambition. He comes across as someone with a ‘know-it-all’, ‘you cant tell me what to do’ attitude, which is way to rampant in Dca. Will he listen to advise once elected? He doesn’t even show these qualities, which is essential to good leader while in opposition.
I will agree with some of what you say as hard as it may be for me to swallow. A lot of people see Linton as a ‘know-it-all’. Maybe it’s his level of confidence which cause him to appear that way, but I really don’t think Linton is a ‘know-it-all’.
UWP supports, remember, the party have your vote already, so while you may disagree with what is being said, if you want to win the DLP supports over, the party may, just may have to consider some of the points which is being suggested by the none-uwp supports. Look at it this way…. it’s not Linton change because people want him to….it’s Linton changing to SAVE Dominica.
I have always felt the man should have taken an online course even in the most malleable academic discipline to placate his detractors. When I looked at Mr. Linton litigating a case in front of the Privy Council, I began to ask myself many questions. But it is he who we have at this time as a viable opposition, and I just hope he listens to the letter, because I can tell you Bro, Dominicans will not give you all the chances they gave to Skerrow.
You are 100% right A_DAMassive. Dominicans will not give him all the chances they gave to Skerrow. Infact i’m 100% certain that if UWP had won in 2014, with all Erica and Maria happening they would have already be kicked out of office for pulling less than half of the the stuff Skerrit has done. Lennox doesn’t have a cult following, if Edison wants to run again in Marigot, Lennox would lose his deposit. lennox doesnt have a track record of success or anything.
My biggest fear is replacing Skerrit, only for him to win with a resounding victory 5 years later- like Vere Bird Sr. in Antigua. And like it or not, Lennox is at best a one term makeshift solution to stem wastage- i expect nothing much. I just wonder why the writer didn’t mention the DFP as a variable option. Maybe this list, excluding No.8, refers to their leader perfectly too.
Anything to get Hon Linton, professional out of the picture. It appears that those who write such comments are really scared of Linton as he has surfaced Skerrit in being an intellectual, honesty, good governance, sincere and a real politician.
Hon Linton is an exceptionally qualified and decent person to run the affairs of Domininca. Stop looking for excuses to protect Skerrit, with all his doctorate cannot and will not make himself availed for a national debate with Hon Linton. Why then is Skerrit running away from the Budget debate speech.. Simple, Skerrit is unable to prepare and present such academic speech compared to Hon Linton. So there is panic in th Labour ca voleur camp that Skerrit is on his way out.. he must go, he has been a nuisance and failed ductored PM.
Utter garbage talk the last part about know it all I may agree with but the about academics makes no sense . Do u listen to the PM speak, do u want a crook with a PHD
100% agree with you. How can he expect to compete with a “Doctor” même si its not a real doctorate. The people will always see him as grammar school drop out. There is absolutely no reason to be sitting with that status when you can get a degree on line. Simple fix.
The writer has made some good points most of them are practical and salient. One has to be sincere as people can easily detect the insincerity in a person. All that most citizens want their elected government officials to do is to create the enabling environment for the working poor to live a comfortable life. People gain employment, work for a decent wage, put food on the table for the family, own a piece of the rock, they are good. The problem arises when greedy politicians want their slice of the pie, your slice and still my slice and leave is with crumbs or nothing.
@Dominican. Some people are just great at masking their true character and intentions. Politicians are adept at this.
You can’t cut and paste someone’s character,however I must admit that some of what you have listed can and should be adopted if there is to be success.
lennox’s dilemma is his strong stance on professional ethics and morality, two attributes foreign to politicians,while attempting to be a politician. While he will be an ideal leader, even his closest allies will be uneasy. Linton can’t change the game. He has to play it as it’s been played through the ages.
Good Letter. I especially like that the letter stresses that this is what people want. You cannot want to be in politics and not be a politician. I do hope the opposition leader takes note.
Nonsense letter . That is his personality. Are you voting for someone to move the country forward or is it a personality contest. No wonder we are where we are
Well Said….i too feel the very same way. it’s time for Change, not for political affiliations but for Dominica!
If you know what you changing to go right ahead. The central policy of the UWP is that Skeritt must go and over the years the UWP has attacked his reputation relentlessly with absolutely no proof to support their claims. I have asked many UWP operatives for their evidence to support their claims against Skeritt but I am still waiting. The UWP is now infested with people of shady character, the evidence is there it is public record both locally and overseas. Unfortunate those who are advocating change are deliberately ignoring the facts
The point is you are forgetting the numerous Bobol activities Hon Linton discovered or undiscovered of this corrupt Labour government. The fear of Skerrit exiting government is frightening for his supporters who are in denial.
Skerrit is a failed leader and for 18 years has corrupted Domininca and brought it more into poverty. All those who promote and defend Skerrit do not have Domininca in their interest.
Focus on the failure and so called bobol activities of the Labour government. For example the bin Bool,, the Fertilizer Bobol and Red Clinic Bobol. The loss of Ross University under his eyes…has been blind did not see it coming. Skerrit is a failure and he must Go. Skerrit Must Go
Lennox is who and what he is. decent, professional politician, a sound determined leader and has Domininca at heart.
I think you’ll find that the UWP has a number of solid policies which are published on their website, just follow this link: http://www.uwpdominica.com/policy
What you think Lennox is? A piece of clay, easily malleable to be shaped in the different ways different people want him to be? While I admit Lennox needs to be more engaging with people generally- an area where he has made some improvements- Lennox has to retain his basic authentic self. He cannot be all what all people want him to be. Can you be whatever all people want you to be? Your list of conditions in order to consider voting for his party is generally unfair. We have had charisma, flattery and telling people what they want to hear. Where have all these taken Dominica? Not in a desirable state by your own admission.
What makes you believe I am a member of the UWP? For your info, I am not. And I am not childish or puerile when I engage in political discussions.
Why should you want to make a leader into what you want or believe he should be like? Lennox is who he is, a grown man well past 60 and his attitude developed over a lifetime will not change. What you are asking of the Opposition leader is to fool the Dominican people as to who he really is. And by the way what are the qualifications of Lennox that he should go through this drastic attitude change so that he can become PM, what is his track record in leadership and management? Surely you are no turn voter, just another frustrated UWP supporter saying that Lennox is not fit to lead
I too am a disgruntled Labourite and a diasporan who just had it with the mess going on in Dominica, and the embarrassment when I discuss Dominica with fellow Caribbean brothers and sisters, and even Africans too. So do not believe the world is not watching. How in the world could a leader of HIS country send HIS wife to make their babies in North America, and it is OKAY with many Dominicans: It is because they are a disrespectable people, and skerrow knows that. This foolishness makes all of us Dominicans look like absolute fools.! And I mean period, with an exclamation following.
Mr. Linton, if, when I was younger, I had been given the advice as you were given in this letter, I would have had amassed so much more wealth. When you are in public service, you are no longer yourself, you are no longer a husband only to our family, and definitely, you are no longer a father only to your children.
The fact that Skerritt had his wife birth his children in America is extremely disrespectful and insulting. So what is he saying, that the country is good enough to rob and lead astray but not good enough for his children to be born there. Come on!!! Being a Dominican is one of the things I am most proud of.
Anyways, he knows that he help make the Dominican passport worthless especially since he selling it to all different criminals and all different nations. He wouldn’t want his children to be associated with a place that sells citizenship to any and every criminal and vagabond.
Is it before he became Opposition Leader, or is it after he became Opposition Leader were his children born in the USA?
@ That nasty Dragon Dominican, my advice to you if you don’t know what you talking about please keep that crap off yours shut before you come talking about Prime minister Dr.Skerrit and his family you dam Well rude ……..
@A_Damassive what difference does it make? If Skeritt had his children born in The US because he thought Dominica was not good enough for them to be born in that is also true for Lennox who made a choice to have his children born in the US. It matters not wether he was leader of the opposition. Are you telling me that his love and concern for Dominica only took root when he became opposition leader? Stop looking for excuses to apply double standards.
Good letter that makes a lot of sense. You care about both sides and it shows that we have tried this gov’t long enuff. Especially after loosing Ross U, a blunder that cost 7% or so of the economy under their watch. Though I sympathized with them for the enormous task of rebuilding after Maria, and the opposition’s insensitivity for continuing their relentless barrage of mepuis and corruption claims the very week after that devastating hurricane; with this Ross U blunder I think someone should step down, there should be an exodus from that gov’t. I agree with you it’s time for a change of government.
WTH that have to do with developing a country, lennox if u lose so what it is there business, this is nonsense ross leaving Dominica and u want the man to smile.
All I want is someone that means business and puts Dominica first, I’m not looking for love or friendship
If you have heard about any kind of Federal financial aid for students, you are already familiar with US Department of Education loans. The US Department of Education handles all government aid for defraying the cost of attending college in America, from grants to loans. The first thing that you will need to do to apply for US Department of Education loans is to fill out a FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid form. FAFSA forms compare the amount of money required to attend a specific college to the amount of money that can be expected to be paid by the family of the attendee. Any difference is the amount of money eligible for student aid.
US Department of Education loans have specific qualifications that an applicant must meet to be eligible. The qualifications include US Citizenship (some non-citizens with social security numbers are also eligible), financial need, possession of a valid Social Security Number, and proof of eligibility for higher education in the form of a high school diploma, General Education Development (GED) certificate, or similar. Furthermore, applicants for US Department of Education loans must be in good financial, academic, and legal standing. In other words, they must be registered with the Selective Service if required, they must not have defaulted on a student loan in the past, they can have no record of conviction on charges of sales or possession of drugs, and they must maintain a certain grade point average (GPA) to continue to receive student loans from the Department of Education.
There are three main possibilities when considering US Department of Education loans: grants, which are monetary gifts, student loans, and work-study programs where the money for education is earned. Only in the case of student loans
does the money need to be repaid. Most federal grants are based solely on financial need, and some are given on a first-come-first-served basis, so it is important to apply as early as possible.
Work-Study programs are not technically US Department of Education loans, but they are a federally mandated way to
receive financial aid to attend college. A number of work-study hours are specified as part of the financial aid package.
These usually involve jobs working with non-profit companies or on campus, and pay a modest salary. The money earned can be used for college tuition. True US Department of Education loans include the Perkins Loan, the Stafford Loan, and the PLUS loan for parents.
Perkins loans have a particularly low interest rate and can be paid back over a time period of as long as 10 years. There are a limited number of Perkins Loans available to each school every year. The Stafford Loan has a higher interest rate than the Perkins loan, and doesn’t necessarily offer a grace period after graduation. However, there are more Stafford loans offered by the US Department of Education every year. Stafford loans are even available to students who don’t have a pressing financial need. Stafford loans may be paid off over a period of as long as thirty years.
PLUS loans are the final type of US Department of Education loans. They are offered to parents of undergraduates, as opposed to the students themselves. Payments on Federal PLUS loans start two months after the money is received, and can be paid off over a ten-year term.

This spring I started playing for a new soccer club as I moved to far away from my old club, which by the way also ended last fall by totally closing their women’s department, so it was a good time to move! My new club, DSIO, is located just across the street where I live now, and I have had no problem settling down with my new team mates. Though we lost the two last games of the spring season, we stayed in the regional series of Funen (Fynsserien), bringing 2 points to our score in the fall tournament. This is actually quite an achievement, as I learned that the team just advanced to this series this year! Newly advanced teams usually have a hard time finding their feeds in the first season, but we managed to go through with only two lost games and three draws (out of 9 games in total), placing us in the top of the table until the last two games. We start the fall season as no. 4 of 6 teams, due to the transfer of points from the spring season, so we have to work to stay in the regional series. I should be possible though. We play each team twice, home and away, and the pool winner will advance to the national series (Danmarksserien), whereas no. 2 will go into two play-out games for possible promotion to this series as well. The number of teams that will advance to the national series depend on the number of teams from Funen that are relegated from this series, though. I don’t believe that our team is qualified to play in the national series anyway, so I think that that it would be fair for us to “just” aim for the 3rd or 4th place this fall.
Today practice starts for the soccer fall season. We have had the possibility to play a bit once a week during summer, but I haven’t gotten off to that, so I look forward to start again, although it was nice with the 1-month break :-)
In a previous post, I wrote about my discussion with my diabetes nurse about how to handle blood sugars during, and especially after, soccer games. We agreed that I should try wearing the pump during the games, mingling with the basals to see if that would solve the problems that I experienced in the spring season. Though I am still not that comfortable with wearing the pump during a game, I think that I ought to at least try it, and then if it doesn’t really work either, I will go back to shots at least on game days – that I know how to handle!
I am not all satisfied with the fact that I will have to figure out how to wear the pump and what the adjustments of the basals should be during games only. However, as I haven’t had the same issues during and after practice, I really have no choice but to try to figure the basal thing out during games. Where to wear the pump on the other hand I plan to experiment with during practices. This will probably also allow me to get an idea of the temporary basal level during at least the first part of a game (until adrenalin takes over and mess things up. My guess is that if I play a full game – 90 minutes – after approximately 30 minutes of warm-up, I will probably have to increase my basals slightly during the second half of the game, while the excitement and gearing up to hard work during warm-up and first part of the game will likely render a lower basal rate necessary). I plan on starting out with rather severe decreases of the basal rates (probably going down to at least 25-30 % of my normal rates) during the initial practices until I find the right level. In spring I went low several times during the last part of our 90-105 min. practices. This is quite annoying as the last half hour of our practices are usually devoted to games and shot practice, neither of which can be performed adequately when hypoglycaemic, but because I really want to be in those activities, I will usually end up just taking a 5 min break to swallow some glucose tabs before continuing. That is of course not ideal, I know, but I can’t help it, it is so hard to accept that diabetes should interrupt in this way and keep you out of the game for 15 minutes or more.
Finally, some question for those of you pumping and playing contact sports wearing the pump: 1) Where do you typically place your pump and tubing during games and practices? 2) How much to you decrease/increase your basals during and after games? 3) How long before and after a game or practice do you run on temp basals? I know that I will have to find my own answers for these questions myself, but it doesn’t hurt to listen to, and possibly learn from, other people’s experience :-)
It's frustrating because it can be so trial & error - and as you talked about, for me, it's really hard to get my body back to feeling strong & quick after dropping too low. The lows just wipe me out.
I'm playing full court basketball at least three times per week for two hours each time. Basketball is contact, but I don't think anything near how physical soccer is.
To wear or not to wear: I have found, as you suspect for you, that I need to go back to my 100% basal about an hour into the exercise. I think my body is using it's alternate fuel sources, usually spilling ketones (from the fatty acids), and making me a bit more resistant to my insulin. Maybe it's not that complex, and is more due to adrenaline, etc. - but the end result is the same. I need my insulin.
I start a temp rate of 30% basal for three hours, starting 2 hours before I start (did you follow that?). You have to make your basal adjustment far enough in advance so it will have time to take affect.
I still usually need to drink gatorade during, which is Ok, to keep from dropping too low. That is usually from having some hangover of my breakfast bolus still working. I'd like to make some changes to my routine on those mornings, but hey, one thing at a time right?
My favorite place to wear my pump is using an elastic strap with a "pump pouch" purchased from one of the online pump accessory shops (pump wear inc or unique accessories, etc). I would wear the strap around my chest region, and place the pump just under my armpit area. I felt I could protect the pump there, and that it was not exposed to much trauma.
But, that didn't work for long. The place I started playing basketball uses a "system" for teams based on shirts or skins. So, one team will have their shirts on and one team will have their shirts off. Makes it easy to know who's on your team, as they change all day long based on how many folks are there.
You can imagine that wearing my pump around my chest would not work too good when I have my shirt off! Not so much the strap or the pump, but rather the tubing running from my pump down to wherever I have my set placed! It would be easily "snagged" and yanked off.
So, I started simply wearing my strap around my waist, underneath my shorts, and tucking the tubing in my shorts too. I will often have my sets placed on my lower back, an inch or two above my beltline, so there is a little tubing exposed, but it's never been caught on anything or anybody.
With the strap around my waist, I place the pump just to the left or right of my "center line", if that makes sense.
We have, I think, a natural instinct to protect our delicate genital & abdomen areas if we start to fall or something - you know, you usually will tuck and try to brace for impact, taking what you can on your arms/legs, etc.? So, the pump feels like it would be very safe there.
I am planning to shop around on the net today to see if I can find some alternative pouch/straps to wear the pump in during soccer. I tried wearing it in my sports bra under my arm for practice yesterday, but that didn't really work out. It moved too much around, and I ended up disconnecting after about an hour in which I had used every small break to try get it back in place :-/
I think it may be more comfortable wearing it at the waistline instead, which will, as you say, also ease the hiding of the tubing.
As for the basal settings, I started out with a temp basal of 50 % yesterday. I generally have a low basal - the lowest of all my basals - at 3.30-6.00 PM (our practice is from 5.00-6.30/6.45 PM) because I tend to go low late in the afternoon. Yesterday I was 5.2 (94) just before practice, so I ate a banana, and otherwise just drank water during practice (as it was the first of the season, we had a rather light session). I was 7.4 (133) afterwards, despite having been disconnected for approximately 45 min, so that was okay.
Hmmm, I do karate, and am dreading the day I take a kick or punch right to the infusion site. I generally use my stomach for my sites and tuck the pump into my sports bra w/o too much movement. But my sports bra is a serious high compression affair and the pump is pretty well wedged in between the "girls." As far as rates go - I find that I also tend to swing high afterwards if I don't have any basal going at all, even if I'm only off pump for 1.5 hours. I do very very low (15-30%) temp basals while exercising intensely and then go to 90-95% for that night.
I was interested to see Scott's comment that he thinks his insulin resistance goes up after exercise. I've also noticed some post exercise highs.
My nurse actually also suggested to place the pump between the "girls", as you call them. I don't think that is ideal though, as occasionally I bring the ball under control using my chest and/or stomach, which could result in some pretty hard punches to the pump from time to time. Although, I would imagine that it wouldn't move around as much being placed there :-)
Tonight is another practice, and at the moment I am battling a bit with myself whether to try to use the velco-strap waist pouch that I normally use for sleeping (until the sports pack I ordered yesterday arrive next week to test), or just disconnect as I used to do in the spring.....

Your Kindle will take it from there. Just make sure that it remains turned on so that the update can be fully implemented. The whole process only takes a couple of minutes.
Prior to the update, my Kindle was running really slow. I had a difficult time trying to get to the different menu options. There have been reports of page turn lagging slow navigation to the home screen. Now that the update is complete, it does seem to run faster. The real verdict will come once I get the chance to use it for a longer period of time.
Overall, this update is minor but it makes some much needed adjustments that will make your navigation and reading experience better. Generally speaking, it is always good to keep the software up to date for top performance and security.
Provide clearer navigation commands. Sometimes I try to move to the next page in my list of books on the home screen, and it clicks into the book itself.
Lastly, page turns for lefties. That is the one thing I miss about my older generation Kindle. It had page turn buttons on both sides.
On e-Reader Tech News we track down the latest e-Reader news. We will keep you up to date with whats hot in the bestsellers section, including books, ebooks and blogs... and we will also bring you great e-reader tips and tricks along with reviews for the latest devices and accessories.

The developer Waninkoko has released its CFW 3.55 v2 loader code allows home and also supports the burden of backups for our PS3.
- This custom firmware for the PS3 increases the system capabilities of your console to allow installation and execution of homebrew applications.
- The Custom Firmware can also allow the loading of legal copies (backups) using these new functions by using backup managers.
- The main core of the payload is based on Hermes, also has some features of PL3 and supplementary code and improved by Waninkoko.
If you have another custom firmware installed (whatever it is) is recommended reinstalling the official 3.55 firmware. To do so follow the following explanation as if you were to upgrade from a lower firmware.
- We take the PS3UPDAT.PUP file and copy it in the UPDATE folder of our Pendrive. It should be something like ms0: PS3/UPDATE/PS3UPDAT.PUP
- Rename the file CFW_PS3UPDAT.PUP to PS3UPDAT.PUP and copy it into the UPDATE folder from Pendrive.
- To install the CFW 3.55 v2, this is recommended from our PS3 Recovery Menu. To enter the Recovery menu will follow the following steps:
- Release the button and turn to leave the button pressed, the console is turned on, will beep 1 time and then make another beep, hold the button wait until one turns off again. Again we let go of the button when the red light.
- Go back to keep your finger on the power button, back has light, make a beep and hope has to do two beeps.
- Release the button and get the Recovery Menu (takes a few seconds to appear), then you will be asked to conect command and press PS button.
- When you reboot our PS3 will see that in the Games menu and the folders Install Packages and / app_home/PS3_GAME / with which we can install applications and run backups (previously loaded with a backup manager) respectively.
- To install homebrews, we'll just enter the installable files .Pkg in a pendrive, connect the Pen to the PS3, go to Install Package and install flies.
- The first thing I install, will be a backup manager, to make copies of our games and to load them: Latest version of multiMAN.
- Its use is simple, press X to load and O to copy. At the time of copying a game, we first ask if you want to copy it to the internal hard drive of our PS3, if you press a No, we asked if we burn to an external hard drive (via USB), choose where you go better.
- To load a game with MultiMAN, get on the game and press X, after which we asked if we start directly without going through the XMB, select No, as the compatibility of this option is low.
- After this, the PS3 return to XMB. Now to load a copy of our game, if you have a disc of any game in the PS3, we can load the game loaded from the disc as the PS3 will believe that is what we have loaded in MultiMAN.
- We also have the option to run the game app_home/PS3_GAME loaded from the folder, and the PS3 also will recognize it as the game.

The history of Malkangiri seems to be in no way less thrilling and adventurous than any other place of India. The land of dense inaccessible forest, small but beautiful rivers, undulating plateaus and splendorous rich tribal culture. Malkangiri has its history of human civilization enrooted as long as 2500 years back. Prior to the modern civilization, many mythological episodes took place in and around Malkangiri. During the reign of Lord Ramachandra, Malkangiri occupied an important place in the entire "The Ramayana". It was the holy river "The Tamasa" and its environs which encouraged Saint Balmiki to express his internal feelings in the form of The Ramayana, the holiest book of Hindus. This place was known as "Malyavantagiri" in the Ramayana. River the Tamasa flowing out of a cave has derived its name from a tribal word "TANSA", which means cave.
Banks of this river witnessed the creation of the largest mythological the Ramayana. The scenic beauty if this Malyavantagiri has found an important place in the "Dandi Ramayana" of Balaram Das. The belief of a visit of Lord Ramachandra is further strengthen by the existance of "Sitakunda" the bath place of Godess Sita near Mudulipada. Also during the period of the Mahabharata, this place became the point of attraction for the Pandavas. They spent their "Angyatvasa"(exile) for a period of one year in the dense forest of Malkangiri. In the villages of Koyas, "PANDABOERU"(Pond) are found which they believe to be used by the Pandavas. Even during the month of January, "PATAKHANDA PARVA" is celebrated by the Koyas, a primitive tribal community in which a sword is worshiped. People believe that this sword belongs to the Pandavas. Also they celebrate the "Bhimudu Parva" during January in which "Bhima", the middle Pandava is worshiped and the Koyas believe the Bhima will save their families. Kanamraju (Lord KRISHNA), Balaraju (ARJUNA) and Poturaju (BHIMA) are three famous Lords of this area, who are being worshiped by the people. In every alternative year, Badayatra, the festival of these Lords is celebrated throughout the district.
During the period of Indus valley civilization, a rich civilization was florished along the bank of river the Tamasa. In the year 1995, some ancient monuments were discovered from the same place signifying the above face. Also a big "Shiva Linga" was discovered from beneath the ground, enlighting a linkage of this civilization with that of Indus valley. The ancient kings of this place during the early vedic and later vedic period, worshiped Lord Mallikeshwar after whom they named their kingdom as "Mallika Nagari". This Mallika Nagari gradually became Malkangiri in the modern times. One ancient Shiva Temple now submerged in the Chitrakonda Reservoir was known as Second Lingaraj of Orissa. This famous Shiva Temple was visited by Sri Chaitanya Deva during his visit to Nandapur.
Existance of a number of Shiva Temples in and around Malkangiri signifies the fact that the ancient kings were shiviests. The founder ruler of Jeypore State King Vinayaka Dev came from Kashmir and got married to Lilabati, the Princess of Nandapur. In the path of establishing the kingdom, he faced a lot of hardship and revolts. Singaraju, the brother of Lilabati sponsored his sincere efforts to King Vinayaka Dev in suppressing the rebel groups. King Vinayaka Dev established two new villages namely Nilakamberu and Singarajukhunta as a mark of respect and gratitude towards Lilabati and Singaraju. Some ancient monuments and idols of different Gods were discovered from Nilakamberu. Malkangiri was florished as a hilly kingdom during the regin of the "Ganga Dynasty" It was known as "Kumbudiri" as mentioned by the first Collector of Koraput District Mr. R.C.S.Bell in gazetter, 1941. There is enough evidence that the wild forest country of Malkangiri is known for a former civilization. In Kondakamberu there are two inscriptions recording a gift to the God Nilakantheswar by the queen of Pandu Singh in the year 1376 A.D.. Kondakamberu was formerly known as "Kambudiri". During the period from 1400 A.D. to 1872 A.D. this priencely state was ruled by as many as twenty six kings. The entire state was divided into four MUTHAS namely Mout, Podia, Korukonda and Padmagiri. The head of each mutha was called "MUTHADAR". Each mutha was further divided into a number of villages of which "PEDA" was the head. The post of Muthadar and Peda were hereditary and recogined by the King of Malkangiri. There was always a fear of foreign invassion for the kingdom for which there was no permanent place for the Kings. Temporary castles were built for the Kings in several places of the state. Ruins of such a castle is still existing over "RajaRani Hill" just in front of Bhairavi Temple of Malkangiri. An annual meeting was held on the "Vijaya Dashami" festival at "Sardar Basani Ambatota" of Deva Dangar. The meeting was attended by all the Muthadar and Pedas of the State. The King used to preside over this meeting and all important decissions were discussed in the meetings. The King delicates power to the Muthadars in this meetings to execute his decissions. The last Queen of Malkangiri, Bangaru Devi ruled over here from 1855 A.D. to 1872 A.D.. She defeated King Ramachandra Deva III of Jeypore by her powerful and extra-ordinarily large Koya Army. She along with her Koya Army faught bravely against the mighty Brithsh Army and finally deposed in 1872 A.D. resulting a complete accession of Malkangiri State into Madras Presidency. Queen Bangaru Devi tried her best and faught for another 8 years upto 1800 A.D. to come power but failed. Finally she lost her life at the age of 70 in the year 1885 after a prolonged illness for 5 years. In the year 1880 A.D., Tama Dora, a brave Koya youngman led the Koya troop, defeated the British Police of Malkangiri and declared himself as the ruler of Podia and Motu. In this incident one Inspector and six policemen of Podia Police Station were killed. This incident is famous as "Koya Revolution" and had its great impact throughout the country.
Colonel Macqoid of Hyderabad ntigent marched with 100 men to protect more but failed by the sever attack of the Koya Army under the leadership of Tama Dora. However the efforts of the brave youngman came to an end when he was brutally killed in the Rampa Forest near Mout on 28/07/1880 by the Military Police of Hyderabad and the organised Koya Army was fragmented lacking a dynamic leadership. After a long gap of 35 years (from 1880 to 1915), rebel groups again tried to fight against British Empire in and around Malkangiri. Unifying all the small rebel groups, alluri sitarama Raju established a big Guerrila Troop and faught against the Brithish Army. Chitrakonda and Kondakamberu were the Headquarters of Sitarama Raju. He was initially a follower of non-violence and grasped a good deal of knowledge on Indian culture, Mythology and religious activities of Hindus. Observing the exploitation of honest tribals by the British Police and their brutality he became violent and their and declare direct war against them. He attacked the young Koya people to join his army by delivering elocant speech. He became popular in an area from Bhadranchalam in Andhra Pradesh to Bastar in Madhya Pradesh. Fearing at the grawing popularty of A.Sitarama Raju, British Tahasildar Bastian along with a huge English Army arrested Raju but finally relased him due to pressure from all corners. He, after being released from police custody made himself involved in direct battle against the British police. He alongwith his large Koya troop raided the Raja Bamangi jail and released a freedom fighter Biraya Dora. In the month of September,1922, two British Army Officers namely Wrighter and Cobbard were killed and another officer Themoy Heir was seriously injured by Alluri Sitaram Raju and his troop. In another incedent in September, 1923; Malkangiri police station and Treasury were looted by Raju & his group. During the begining of 1924, Assam Rifles and Malabar Troops were sent to the forest of Malkangiri for supprerssing the rebels. The troops cordered Chitrakonda and attacked the Koya Army from all sides. A large no. of Koya yound fighters were killed and many tribal families werer tortured brutally by English Army.
Finally A.Sitarama Raju was called for a discussion with the Collector. But it was a conspiracy. Raju was caught by the Malabar Troops and tied up with a tamarind tree. Finally by order of Major Guddal, Malabar Troops fired at Raju and killed him. The brave episode of Sitarama came to an end with the clear suppression of Koyas. Again Malkangiri came into National News when Laxman Naiko, the greatest freedom fighter ever this place had led the tribals for a non-cooperation movement against the British. He was a follower of non-violence principle of Mahatma Gandhi. In 1942 he led a demonstration in Mathili on 21st of August police opened fire at the peaceful nob killing & demonstrators namely Nakula Pujari, Samara Nayak, Narasingha Bhumia and Linga Bhumia. In this incident, a forest guard namely G.Ramaya was killed for which Laxman Naiko was accused of and arrested. The trial continued for four months and on 13th November, 1942 the then Sessions Judge V.Ramanathan put forward his verdict, " Accused No.1 Sri Laxman Naiko is convicted under sectuion 302 I.P.C. and sentenced to death subject to confirmation by the Hon'ble High Court ". Advocate Radha Charan Das of Berhampur and famous freedom fighter Uma Charan Pattnaik of Berhampur went to Patna High Court for an appeal which was finally rejected. On 29th March, 1943 the file of Sri Laxman Naiko came to an end when he was hanged till death in Berhampur jail. It has been studied that the case against Laxman Naik was weak and it was opened to go for higher appeal in court of law. But no significant steps were taken in this regard by any of the famous personalities of that time. Even it is most unfortunate that the people involved in the entire process of Laxman Naik's arrest and death penality were able to get all Government facilities, employment and promotion during the post indepence period. Prior to 1936, Malkangiri was a part of Madras Presidency. In 1936, Koraput District from Madras Presidency merged in Orissa and Malkangiri Tahasil war included in Koraput District. The first English Collector of Koraput District Mr.R.C.S.Bell in the year 1941 prepared the Gazetteer of Koraput in which he described the physical condition,climatic condition and all about the tribal people of Malkangiri Tahasil. This Tahasil was a part of Nawarangpur Sub-Division of Korapur District. In 1st January, 1962, Malkangiri Sub-Division came into existence. In 1958, Dandakaranya Development Project was implemented to settle the refugees coming from East Pakistan.
This project was continued for 30 years until it was declared closed in the year 1988. Finally in 2nd October, 1992 Malkangiri got its identity as a District as per Notification No. 49137/R dated 01.10.1992 of Orissa Government in Revenue and Excise Department, Orissa, Bhubaneswar which carved out of Koraput District.
Malkangiri District came into existance with effect from 02nd of October'1992 after being bifurcated from the earstwhile Koraput District as per Notification No. 49137/R dated 01st of October'1992 of Government of Orissa in Revenue and Excise Department, Bhubaneswar, Orissa. Malkangiri District lies between 17° 45' N to 18° 40' N Latidudes and 81° 10' E to 82° 00' E Longitude and at a height of 641" (feet) form the sea level.
In the EAST Malkangiri is bounded by KORAPUT(a portion) of ORISSA, VISHAKAPATTANAM and EAST GODAVARI district of ANDHARA PRADESH.
The Climate of the major portion of the district which lies in the elevation to the north of the District puts a great impact to the climatic condition of the Malkangiri District. The year may be divided into four seasons, the hot season from March to June, the mansoon season from July to September, the post-mansoon months October and November, and the cold season from December to February. December is the the coldest part of the year with the average daily minumim temperature at 11.2°C. Both day and night temperature progressively increase after January till May which is the hottest month. On individual days in May and June before the onset of the mansoon maximum temperature may reach over 47°C. Therefore temperature decreases with the onset of the mansoon. During the mansoon, weather is cool and pleasent with day temperatures nearly the same as those in the cold seasons. Humidity is generally high especially in the mansoon and post mansoon months. In other months, afternoons are comparatively drier. Humidity varies widely between the mansoon months of July and August and the winter months of November and December. During the summer months winds are generally light and blow from directions mainly between south and west.During the pre-mansoon and mansoon seasons winds strengthen and blow from a south-westerly or westerly direction. In the post-mansoon and cold seasons winds are light and variable. The district is affected by depressions from the Bay of Bengal particularly in September and October that causes high wind and widespread heavy rain. A few high wind and thunderstorms occure in the pre-mansoon months.

Yeah, I do. Though these days it's "code the demo at work or not at all" as I don't really feel like coding when I come back from work.
Same applies here, if I can do the slaves at work, no prob, but that's not always possible. Plus, I prefer doing slaves for demos anyway. I guess I only do demo slaves and slaves for football games

This was the second brand campaign the TM agency did for Discover Network. It began as the theme I developed for a booth at a trade show. Discover Network had recently won an antitrust ruling that opened the door for merchants to accept Discover cards. Prior to the ruling, Discover cards could not be processed on the same terminal as Visa and MC cards because their merchant agreements did not allow it. Acceptance of Discover cards began growing by leaps and bounds.

The ad is brilliant in that it sums up the positioning the Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) agency had carved out for the Volkswagen Beetle and equates it to the lunar lander in the same endearing tone.
The work DDB did for VW was so groundbreaking Advertising Age proclaimed it the best advertising campaign of the 20th century. Take a look at how different it was from other advertising at the time. Below are two ads from the early 1960s. One is for Buick and the other was created by DDB for VW:
Volkswagen was just one of many memorable campaigns by DDB — the agency is widely credited with sparking a creative revolution in advertising.
The secret sauce? In a time when ad agencies were routinely staffed by WASPs with Ivy League Educations, Bill Bernbach shook up the status quo by hiring talented Jews, Italians and Greeks. He was also the first to pair art directors and copywriters together. The result was a style of advertising that was irreverent but persuasive.
The Exxon Valdez was a supertanker carrying approximately 55 million gallons of oil when it ran aground on a reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, on March 24, 1989. At least 11 million gallons of crude oil spilled into the habitat for salmon, sea otters, seals and seabirds.
As frequently happens when things go wrong, people immediately looked for someone to blame. They settled on the captain of the ship, Joseph Hazelwood. He was portrayed as a careless drunk who was singularly responsible for the disaster.
In fact, he was the only person to face criminal charges. Before his trial, he claimed he had been “flushed down the toilet” by Exxon and was being made a scapegoat. Many agreed. Ultimately, Hazelwood was acquitted on all felony charges, but was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of negligent discharge of oil.
About this 1989 ad, copywriter and agency president Rick Colby told Communication Arts: “We did the ads for Greenpeace for almost ten years, and we won lots of awards for the work. But I think this was my favorite ad. It was so simple, so true.”
That makes for an effective ad — people recalled it decades later with the advent of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.
Because the truth is, the spill was caused by a nation drunk on oil. And a government asleep at the wheel.
When Daffy Dan’s Bargain Town opened in Elizabeth, NJ in 1961 it was a store where you could find all sorts of items for surprisingly low prices (silver dollars were 88 cents). Today, the store specializes in clothing and is simply called Daffy’s. Read More
This 1987 ad for the Honda CRX-Si is best understood in the context of the times. After two major oil-price shocks in the 1970s, the muscle-car era in America gave way to the economy-car era. The CRX-Si promised the best of both worlds.
Good advertising always has an element of truth to it. Here’s a comment from a former Honda CRX-Si driver that was made on the Internet in 2008:
I owned the all black 1986 Honda CRX si. I loved that car more than any car I have ever owned. It is the reason I have always owned Hondas; Accords, Element and the Odyssey. I was 18 at the time and the car was a pure pocket rocket. I balded the front tires within 3 months from “excessive acceleration” according to local PD. It handled like a dream and cornered like it was on a slot car track. So much fun to drive.
English Heritage is a government-funded group in the United Kingdom that is responsible for raising awareness of UK history and preserving historic buildings. By that standard, this 1995 ad and the others in the campaign are winners. Not only do they educate readers about UK history, they also encourage visits to the sites. Ticket and souvenir sales at these these historic sites are used to fund the group’s preservation efforts.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in Canadian women and early detection dramatically increases a woman's chance of survival. Until recently, womens' ages were considered the single most influential risk factor for developing breast cancer. Today, the density of fibroglandular tissue within the breast is considered just as important a risk factor as age. Because of this, accuracy and consistency while estimating tissue density is paramount. Currently, radiologists use the BI-RADS classification system to place mammographic images into one of four different categories. However, inter-observer variance has been shown to be as high as 30% and the methodology can be highly subjective. Many computer vision algorithms have been developed to automatically quantify breast density but only a few of these algorithms take advantage of the latest digital mammographic imaging technology. One algorithm, specifically designed to use digital mammography images, is explored in detail. Its ability to quantify and classify fibroglandular breast tissue is demonstrated and its accuracy is shown to be consistent with experienced radiologists. Finally, a modification to dramatically improve the running time is shown to have minimal effect on the overall accuracy of the algorithm.
Is it honorable to force men or women to wear veils or any particular garment? - Page 2 - Biblical Criticism & History Forum - earlywritings.com
Most churches and mosques are run by men who impose dress codes and decide on what the punishment will be for infractions. In Islam, to the point of Honor Killing.
I live relatively near five mosques, have visited all of them, and have met women from all of them. There is zero reason to believe that any of them dictate a dress code for women in public, much less advocate "Honor Killing." Your rhetorical question is little more that bigotry proffered in a disingenuous (if not cowardy) way.
Is there any honor in using force to have people comply with un-proven religious customs, or killing the women who refuse?
So, you do not consider it "honorable" to "dictate" a dress code? Your language is a little "loaded," which I did not notice at first. Why the chip on your shoulder?
Amish boys & girls do not join the church until they are baptised as adults. They believe in baptism as a member of their faith only after making a dedication to follow god in their traditions. Until then (around age 21 for most) they are in a period they call "rumspragah" (sp?) which means "free room" of something like that. Lost of Amish girls go to bars or clubs, wear makeup, smoke cigarettes and maybe try drugs a bit. Boys also smoke, try drugs, get into fights, maybe buy a car which they hide in the family cornfield even though their parents usually know about it. One Amish man who ran an interior trim business told me they loose about 15% of their youth (that means they do not become members). They might decide to go Baptist or low order Mennonite, or nothing at all, and there is no penalty for this kind of thing. They have followed their conscience.
I do not know whether Islam (or one or more of the variants of Islam out there) has a tradition for adult "confirmation," although I don't think so. It is the more fanatical factions of Islam who blow up mosques of other factions in suicide attacks. White "crackers" types have also attacked people they despise, lynching them in the "old days" or "cracking" heads. We used to call them the KKK. Honor killing, where it occurs in Islam, is cultural. I think that Saudi rulers recognized that westerners have different cultural values, so they have the US military personnel (including female soldiers driving cars, etc.) in bases that are isolated from Saudi society to avoid clashes. Shopping malls, mixed bathing pools and beaches, and all that. Sucide bombers do not seem to target these facilities.
But like I mentioned before, we in the USA had a tradition, only about 100 years ago, in which women were property of men and a man had the right to beat his wife for no good reason. We consider ourselves more sophisticated than that today, although the sexual harassment scandals show that many men still like to push around women like they owned all they can see. But I have worked for or seen many managers (men and women) who were tyrants, building mini-feifdoms and bullying their employees, regardless of sex, relentlessly to advance their agendas, played out like a game of chess with the employees as pawns. I do hate all game players, men or women, who callously play their games with human lives. Sometimes I can sympathize with anarchists who want to tear down that whole crappy system in hopes that people, allowed to the inherent good in everybody, will build a better society, but I think this is probably just a pipe dream.
All clothing is artificial. It only serves a purpose for warmth or sexual enhancement. A human's natural state is naked, but all persons are forced to wear clothing in public. Yes it is wrong to force another to behave against nature. All people should walk naked.
And I think that the covering-up 'rules' for women in Islam are, amongst other things, deeply sexist.
When in South-East Asia if I wish to visit certain temples I am dishonorably forced to wear a sash around my waist. Sometimes I am forced to remove my shoes. In New Guinea male children grow up being forced to wear penis sheaths. Anthropology is the study of the dishonorable. Humans are universally forced to display certain types of dress, follow certain diets, control body impulses, .... all dishonorably arbitrary, the mere whim of social customs.
Rushed to labour and then given birth to an adult or a litter of animals recently? Well, surprisingly enough, you’re not alone. This is a common theme in pregnancy dreams and thankfully doesn’t mean you have anything to worry about! When we’re pregnant, our dreams will often take a vivid turn and a recurring topic will be the growing baby.
Although everyone dreams, a lot of people don’t remember their night time adventures. (This may have been you pre-pregnancy!) However during week by week pregnancy the hormone progesterone means we experience more emotional highs and lows, which may be translated onto our subconscious self.
Pregnant women are much more likely to have disturbed sleep thanks to needing the toilet, anxiety, heartburn, nausea or insomnia. The more times someone wakes up in the night, the more likely they are to remember their dreams. So this is why it might suddenly seem like your subconscious is going crazy as soon as you find out your expecting, or even before.
Obviously, once we know we’re pregnant, we think about it nearly every moment of the waking day. This is why you often dream about your baby, as your mind is making sense of the day’s events.
When you experience nightmares, it’s hard not to panic and feel like your body is trying to tell you that something is wrong, but nightmares during pregnancy are actually very common because of the anxiety which comes with being pregnant. Your body is trying to sort out all your fears and worries and often these can translate into nightmares of losing the baby or harm coming to you, your partner or the baby. It’s helpful to remember that dreams are meant to be therapeutic and are a natural way for your brain to process all the changes in your body and mind.
Although some women can revel in the new creativity they are experiencing at night, others may have more disturbing dreams which leads to insomnia. If you are worried about your sleeping pattern then talk to your GP and see if they can help. Otherwise, try to enjoy your vivid new dreams and if you remember them in the morning, don’t over analyse them. Tell a friend, laugh them off and concentrate on catching up on some ‘zzz’s.
Dreams are always interesting, sometimes I wonder what they mean. I believe that the pregnant woman, the experience must be incredible.

TechnoBoy - age 13. My handsome boy loves loves loves anything electronic: computer games, television shows, gadgets and more are his style. He recently took up collecting baseball cards. He wants to be a fireman part time and a computer programmer part time when he grows up, especially if he gets to invent computer games.
The Mercenary - age 13. This wavy haired cutie loves computers and gadgets like his brother, but loves money more. Is even willing to [gasp] work for it. The Mercenary is a salesman's salesman. I once counted him asking his twin for something 17 times in a row and not taking no for an answer. We do have some fears that he'll go into politics.
The Manager - age 8. Has the biggest smile and most gorgeous blue eyes a boy could have. Rules are important in The Manager's life, except for when they're not. He NEVER stops thinking or talking about what he's thinking. He loves to help Mama pick up around the house and is a great helper.
Captain Earthquake - age 8. Is tremendously adorable and knows it. He earned the nickname with his wild sleeping habits. Is very fond of showing off his latest trick to loved ones. Definitely a Mama's boy, but will flirt with any female who captures his attention. He likes to gross out older brothers by telling them that he likes girls.
In the sky over the Mediterranean Sea on Saturday, December 23, was recorded a slowly moving meteor. The event lasted about 14 seconds before the celestial body exploded.
“This wonderful meteor, which resembled a Christmas star, was seen in Spain at 22:07 local time (21:07 UTC),” said Jose Maria Madiedo, a professor at the University of Huelva.
Presumably, it was part of a comet fragment that entered the earth’s atmosphere at a speed of 43,000 km / h. His flight began at an altitude of about 93 km and ended at an altitude of 60 km above the Mediterranean Sea.

The timeless music of ABBA will resonate from the western hilltops when the Warsaw Federal Incline Theater opens its 2019 Summer Classics Season with the smash-hit musical MAMMA MIA.
Cincinnati Landmark Productions announced today that it will mount the first local production of the successful and oft-requested jukebox musical. Opening night is set for May 1, 2019, with a total of 20 performances ending on May 26, 2019.
Executive Artistic Director Tim Perrino said the group has been keeping a close eye on the production rights for years and is anxious to bring it to the Summer Classics Season audiences. In fact, it was the runaway, most-requested show title on audiences surveys for several years.
“MAMMA MIA fits perfectly in the category of a modern classic musical,” he said. “It’s bright, it’s fun and it’s energetic. We can’t wait to assemble the best local talent to produce it and wow our audiences.”
Subscriptions for the 2019 Summer Classics Season go on sale on August 15, 2018. The other three productions in the season will be announced later this summer. Current subscribers have until March 2019 to renew their tickets and keep their seats. Non-subscription, single show tickets for MAMMA MIA and the other 2019 Summer Classics productions go on sale April 1, 2019.
MAMMIA MIA uses ABBA's hits to tell the hilarious story of a young woman's search for her birth father. This sunny and funny tale unfolds on a Greek island paradise. On the eve of her wedding, a daughter's quest to discover the identity of her father brings three men from her mother's past back to the island they last visited 20 years ago.
The story-telling magic of ABBA's timeless songs propels this enchanting tale of love, laughter and friendship, creating an unforgettable show. A large cast, non-stop laughs and explosive dance numbers combine to make Mamma Mia! an audience favorite.
ABBA has re-appeared in the cultural zeitgeist recently. The band announced last week that it was set to release new music for the first time since breaking up in 1982. The film version of Mamma Mia!, starring Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan, became the highest grossing live-action musical film of all time upon its release in 2008. A second film, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, will be released in cinemas later this summer on July 20.

SYNOPSIS: Prison guard Nick Glass is new to the job, and he's completely unsuited to it. He's an obvious mark for both the hardened cons and the veteran guards alike. When his wife and child are threatened, Nick agrees to do one favor for the cons. Of course, one favor turns into many and soon the pressure of trying to hold together and protect his family, as well as do his job, pushes Nick closer to his breaking point and a chain of events that no one, least of all Nick Glass, could have predicted.
REVIEW: After reading the synopsis, you may think you know what this book is about and you may even think you have some idea of how it will progress. You'd be dead wrong. In fact, this isn't even a prison story in the usual sense of that term. 'Slammer' isn't just about a physical prison; it's about all the prisons, external and internal, that confine a young man who suffers bullying and abuse and extortion. While some events occur within the prison where Nick works, Nick himself becomes the figurative prisoner of more forceful characters, and he's also a prisoner to those he loves. This is a dark jigsaw-puzzle of a book where mirrors and memories are not to be trusted anymore than Nick can trust the prisoners out to take advantage of his weaknesses.
Author Allan Guthrie does a staggering job of creating a Nick Glass who is irritating in his weakness but is also pitiable and likeable, a man as fragile as his name. Nick has murky depths beyond his primary character flaw, and Guthrie irrevocably adjusts, sometimes violently and sometimes indirectly, the lights and mirrors to reveal what's swimming in those depths. To say more would be to give away important elements of the story, and this book is too good to mistreat.
Adding to the vise-like pressure of Nick's situation are the claustrophobic scenes occurring either within the confines of the prison or the small house Nick shares with his wife and child. Nick becomes a black hole of pressure, where tension goes in but cannot be released. The author doesn't so much raise the level of tension as he compresses it around and into Nick personally, and the scenes begin to feel more and more confined until it's as if everything that is happening is entirely internal to Nick.
Readers should be prepared to give Nick's story full time and attention because events move quickly and there are time shifts. Casual references made early assume greater significance as the book progresses. Even so, expect moments of 'oh, I see!' mingled with sharp sadness. Nick Glass is an unforgettable protagonist and Guthrie has placed him in a darkly tragic, poignant, and ultimately satisfying psychological thriller.
Your review makes the story sound downright claustrophobic and panicky (in a good way... and that's saying a lot for someone who doesn't like confined spaces). The pressure/bullying setup here could be quite gripping to the reader. Interesting that the cover artwork you use here differs significantly from the one the major online resellers are using. Do either give something away in the story? Wonderful review, Corey.
Thanks for pointing out the two covers, Michael. I've added the photo to the post to amend my error. I should have been paying attention since my ARC has the eye-catching skull cover! Does either cover give something away? I'd have to say no regarding the keys cover. The skull cover hints maybe, but doesn't give away anything major. It gains in significance after reading though.

This medieval temple is a Shivalaya (where Shiva is worshipped) and named after the sculptor Ramappa. It is the only temple in the world named after its sculptor/architect. Its presiding deity, Ramalingeswara, is the form of Shiva and a personal god of the Avatar of Vishnu, Rama. The history says that it took 40 years to build this temple.
This is opposite the beautiful temple, an example of brilliant Kakatiya dynasty art, Planned and sculpted by Ramappa, the temple was built on the classical pattern of being lifted above the world on a high star-shaped platform. Intricate carvings line the walls and cover the pillars and ceilings. Starting at its base to its wall panels, pillars and ceiling are sculpted figures drawn from Hindu mythology.[2] The roof (garbhalayam) of the temple is built with bricks, which are so light that they are able to float on water
The hall in front of the sanctum is filled with exquisitely carved pillars that are placed as to combine light and space wonderfully with the finely chiselled walls and ceiling. There are two small Shiva shrines on either side of the main temple. The enormous Nandi within, facing the shrine of Shiva, remains in good condition. In most of the shiva temples, the Nandi was strait to deity but in the temples built by KAKATIYAS the nandi is in an alert position and waiting for the order of lord shiva. Acharya Nataraja Ramakrishna revived Perini Shivatandavam (Perini Dance), by seeing the sculptures in this temple. The dance poses written in NRITTA RATHNAVALI by JAYAPA SENAANI also appears in these sculptures. The temple built area is 5 acres and a twenty acres of land was developed by the greenery around the temple. A total of 25 km radious found historic temples in the district.

After his years with Monty Python and getting little chances to direct here and there with Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Monty Python and the Meaning of Life, Terry Gilliam made his real directorial debut in 1981 with Time Bandits (not counting, of course, the Python-esque Jabberwocky).
Conceived as a "quickie" while waiting for his more expansive Brazil to get off the ground, Time Bandits is one of those rare films that succeeds as a fantasy delightful enough for children and entertaining enough for adults. It's not one of those films that dwells on clichés -- i.e. learning lessons -- or anything you might have seen before.
Young Kevin (Craig Warnock) is the only one in modern-day England with any imagination. His parents and all their friends are obsessed with the latest time-saving electronic gizmos. But everything changes when six dwarves crash through his bedroom closet and whisk him away to the time of Napoleon (Ian Holm, in his first of three appearances as the great conqueror). Apparently, the dwarves work for the Supreme Being (Ralph Richardson) and have stolen a map from him. The map documents the various holes in the universe through which one can travel through time. After robbing Napoleon, the band visits Robin Hood (John Cleese), King Agamemnon (Sean Connery) and the deck of the Titanic. Eventually the travelers end up in a kind of weird fantasy land, where history holds no bearing. Unfortunately, Evil (David Warner) will stop at nothing to steal the map for himself.
Gilliam's strongest point is his potent imagination and his ability to twist it into awesome reality. He's fond of shooting from startling angles, revealing as much of his vision as can possibly fit on the screen. It's amazing how the homemade special effects of this comparatively low-budget picture are still effective today -- even more so than many computerized effects.
Time Bandits was produced by George Harrison's Handmade films, which also gave us such treasures as Mona Lisa and Withnail & I. Harrison even produced and provided a song for the end credits.
Gilliam, who co-wrote the screenplay with Monty Python's Michael Palin, relies on old-time jokes to round out the adventure story, but never quite gets into the toilet. Palin, who appears in two time periods as a love-struck schmuck stuck on Shelley Duvall, hints at flaws in his physical prowess without ever getting gory. In any case, the film still made me laugh 23 years after its initial release.
In 1999, the Criterion Collection released its Time Bandits DVD with a director's commentary track. In 2004, Anchor Bay released a 2-disc DVD set with no commentary track, but with an hour-long documentary on Gilliam, a half-hour interview between Gilliam and Palin, trailers, the original screenplay available via DVD-Rom, a fold-out map, and other goodies. (The Criterion version is apparently still in print, while the Anchor Bay edition is not.) Now, in 2010, Image Entertainment has released the Blu-Ray edition, but with even fewer extras. Now we get only the Gilliam interview and a trailer. However, the picture looks quite glorious, and it comes with optional subtitles. I think I'll be keeping this edition, as well as my 2004 DVD version.

Egg sharing enables women who are willing to share their eggs to have free fertility treatment. The treatment cycle is done, however after the egg collection, half of the eggs collected are given to an egg recipient who pays the expense of treatment. If there is an odd number of an egg collected then you will have the capacity to choose whether you or recipient gets the remaining egg.

October is National Vegetarian Month. According to Wikipedia, the purpose is to “bring awareness to the ethical, environmental, health, and humanitarian benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle. World Vegetarian Day initiates the month of October as Vegetarian Awareness Month, which ends with November 1, World Vegan Day, as the end of that month of celebration.”
As I am practicing a 7 Day Raw Food Cleanse this week, I consider it serendipitous that I began the cleanse in the month of October. Although I’ve been plant based for a couple of years, eating raw fruits and veggies this week has raised my awareness of and gratitude for this health lifestyle.
I don’t often offer reasons for why this is a great lifestyle. Instead, I prefer to live my life as an example of one who has benefitted greatly from changing my diet, and answer questions when people ask. In honor of the month, and the week I am experiencing, and truly, in honor of the extraordinary healing I have received, consider the facts below about eating more fruits and veggies.
Vegetarian – a person who does not eat meat, and sometimes other animal products, especially for moral, religious, or health reasons.
Plant Based – a diet based on foods derived from plants, including vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds, legumes and fruits, but with few or no animal products.
Vegetarians avoid meat but may use other animal products. Vegans strictly avoid ALL animal products including honey and beeswax, leather, silk, wool and fur, and cosmetics containing animal products or that were tested on animals. Plant based eaters choose whole foods and avoid meat, dairy, eggs and fish but may use honey or wear clothing derived from animals.
I classify myself as plant based. I do use organic honey, although I probably wouldn’t if producing it killed the bees, but I avoid most other animal based products in all areas of my life.
1. Reduces inflammation in the body, lowering risks of heart attacks, strokes and autoimmune diseases.
3. Gives the body’s microbiome a makeover, which reduces the risks for obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, autoimmune disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and liver disease.
5. Reduces risk of type 2 diabetes. Animal fat, animal-based iron, and nitrate preservatives in meat have been found to damage pancreatic cells, worsen inflammation, cause weight gain, and impair the way our insulin functions.
6. Gives the body the right kind, and right amount, of protein, reducing risk for cancer. The average omnivore in the US gets more than 1.5 times the optimal amount of protein, most of it from animal sources. Excess protein is stored as fat or turned into waste, and animal protein is a major cause of weight gain, heart disease, diabetes, inflammation, and cancer. On the other hand, the protein found in whole plant foods protects us from many chronic diseases.
7. Makes a huge impact on the health of the planet and its inhabitants. Animal agriculture is destructive to the planet. It is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and is a leading cause of land and water use, deforestation, wildlife destruction, and species extinction. About 2,000 gallons of water are needed to produce just one pound of beef in the US. Oceans are rapidly becoming depleted of fish; by some estimates, oceans may be fishless by 2048. The current food system, based on meat and dairy production, also contributes to world hunger—the majority of crops grown worldwide go toward feeding livestock, not feeding people.
Equally important, animals raised for food are sentient beings who suffer, whether raised in industrial factory farms or in farms labeled “humane.” Eating a plant-based diet helps us lead a more compassionate life. After all, being healthy is not just about the food we eat; it’s also about our consciousness—our awareness of how our choices affect the planet and all of those with whom we share it.
I get it. Change can be difficult. My switch to plant based was initially to shift my health. As my body healed, I became aware of the other benefits that extended beyond my own health.
Here are ways you can increase your fruit and veggie intake, even if you don’t feel ready to make big changes.
• Create a Meatless Monday and/or a Fresh Food Friday meal each week, experimenting with new foods, prepared in new ways. Plant based doesn’t mean boring salads. Far from it!
• Look up recipes on Pinterest for inspiration. In the search bar type Plant Based Recipes or Vegan Meals.
• Instead of starting the day with a heavy breakfast or sugary cereals, try a fruit smoothie. Combine bananas with fresh or frozen fruit or greens and just enough water to make the smoothie pourable.
• Replace a soda, or two, with herbal teas or a fresh juice. Run your favorite fruits and veggies through a juicer and enjoy.
• Take a plant based cooking class, online or in person, and learn new ways to prepare nutritious meals.
• Go grocery shopping with a friend and challenge each other to shop from the produce section only. Brainstorm together and come up with meals to create from the abundance there.
The best way for me to celebrate National Vegetarian Month, other than taking excellent care of my health and wellbeing, is to make a positive impact on others. An opportunity appeared this afternoon, to discuss the benefits of a plant based lifestyle with a young man working in a grocery store. He studied my shopping cart and then curious, asked me good questions about why I eat the way I do.
How long have you been plant based? Why did you change your diet? Was it difficult? What about the holidays? Do you skip the turkey?
We had a wonderful conversation. His openness allowed me to be open. I wasn’t trying to force him to change. He wasn’t trying to defend his choices or ridicule mine. We simply discussed what it means to be plant based, and the impact animal agriculture is having. And we chatted about health and how crucial food is to keeping our bodies running smoothly, or not.
I appreciated him. And I am grateful for this whole month set aside to increase awareness of what it means, to individuals, to animals, to the planet, to be vegetarian, vegan or plant based.
Giving up sugar, dairy, eggs and meat isn’t a death sentence. It’s a life sentence. Long may we all live, in the greatest possible health.
I stirred briefly last night, my consciousness rising from some vague dream, mumbling a single word: euphoria. Speaking aloud woke me up enough to wonder why that particular word was important, and to lock the experience into my memory. Sleep claimed me again.
This morning I recalled the incident with a chuckle. It’s not unusual for me to wake with a word, movie quote or the snippet of a song in my head. What’s important is that I’ve learned to pay attention to these seemingly random thoughts.
A few months after I shifted into a plant based lifestyle in 2016, these incredible feelings of joy would suddenly wash over me, seemingly from no where. In fact, I was usually alone, engaging in an ordinary, routine task like driving or tidying the kitchen.
I’m naturally a happy person who can be annoyingly upbeat and positive. However these waves of energy were intense…deeply experienced…and they inspired gratitude. I knew enough to identify the feeling as euphoria. Yet I never questioned the source, beyond believing that my improving health perhaps contributed to the sensation.
I eventually decided that I had lived with pain for so long, that I had forgotten what healthy felt like.
The euphoric moments have continued, and increased in frequency. Multiple times a week, and sometimes daily, this inexplicable joy surges through me, radiating outward from the center of my being, my heart. Tears fill my eyes even as my mouth curves into a smile.
Early this morning, I reached for my phone. After waking up with the word escaping my lips, it was time to dig deeper. I looked up euphoria.
By definition, euphoria is “a feeling or state of intense excitement and happiness“. From my research I found that alcohol, stimulants, and exercise can induce euphoria, as can success. These episodes are typically brief, and none of these are the sources of my own experiences.
Looking at the origin of the word provided a clue. Euphoria comes from the Greek words eu – well and pherein- to bear. Combined the words morphed into euphoros – well borne, healthy and later the word that we know today.
My instinctive association between euphoria and health proved accurate. The “intense feeling of happiness” is a result of my body bearing well the state of good health.
For the past month, I’ve considered entering into a raw food cleanse. My healing journey began two plus years ago, with a 28 day cleanse, in which I only ate raw fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds. Although I’ve experienced a week long juice cleanse and I eat raw foods about half of the time, I’ve not participated in a fully raw cleanse since 2016.
Guided by euphoria, I stocked up today on fresh organic fruits and veggies. My freezer is filled with bags of organic fruit as well, for morning or evening smoothies. My sister Linda, who is taking charge of her own health and well being, joined me on a fun shopping trip.
For the next week, and possibly beyond, I’ll nurture my body with nutrient dense foods that will deliver health at a cellular level. My digestive system gets a break while my liver detoxes. The journey will be documented on my other blog site, Journey With Healthy Me. Follow along there.
Photographing some of my life giving produce this evening, that incredible feeling of joy rose and I laughed. My body is already vibrating at a higher energy level, in response to the sight of such gorgeous food. I nibbled on sprouts and sampled cherry tomatoes, sweet strawberries and tart blackberries. It feels like such a loving thing to do for myself.
Everyone is familiar with the old adage, an apple a day keeps the doctor away. I’ve heard that saying all my life, and yet I’ve never felt inspired to eat more apples, even though I liked the idea of keeping the doctor away.
What if the emphasis should be on eating an apple…at least one…every day, rather than avoiding the doctor? After switching to a plant based lifestyle, I experienced an incredible amount of healing. Becoming pain free and able to walk without a cane was my initial motivation. However, what happened was that my focus shifted to simply eating whole plant based foods, and that allowed my body to do its thing.
A body that is supported and supplied with high energy living foods naturally heals itself. It’s what the body is created to do. A body that is fed poor quality, low energy, processed foods struggles to maintain itself and begins to function poorly and then break down.
As my diet changed, my body healed, eliminating the pain, yes, and also healing from a host of disorders and ailments. It also naturally released excess weight.
I’ll be starting another 28 Day Cleanse again soon, where I will focus on consuming raw fruits and vegetables. I like the energy that comes from simplifying my diet, and the detoxing that occurs as my body purges itself from any toxins I’ve picked up. I’ll be inviting people to join me, or at least to follow my journey, if they would like to experience a profound health shift.
However, for those who don’t feel ready for such a dramatic change, this easier challenge is the perfect way to bring more life giving food into the diet.
Anthony William, also known as the Medical Medium, issued a 21 Day Apple Challenge this morning, that officially kicks off tomorrow on Instagram. The challenge is simple. Eat at least one apple a day and post a photo on Instagram. The pic could show a bowl of apples, or apple slices with date sauce, or your family picking apples at an orchard.
Each day Anthony will select two posts on Instagram to feature. The creators of those posts will each receive a copy of Anthony’s newest book that releases next month, Liver Rescue.
Why an apple for the 21 day challenge? Because that fruit is so vital to liver health that it graces the cover of the book. Apples help to heal liver related diseases such as eczema, psoriasis, acne, SIBO, gout, bloating, weight issues, premature aging, fatigue, autoimmune diseases and many more disorders. I’m looking forward to receiving this new book and focusing on a healthy liver.
In the meantime, what a great way to begin cleansing and nourishing my liver by participating in the 21 Day Apple Challenge. I stocked up on apples today. I enjoyed a sliced apple this afternoon and I look forward to trying new ways to include apples in my diet daily.
Get on Instagram…it’s free to create an account…and follow Medical Medium. All the details about the challenge and winning free books are there. While you are on Instagram, find me as well. I have two accounts…Journey With Healthy Me and Cindy Lauderdale Moore.
Let’s do the challenge together! An apple a day…or two or three…will not only keep the doctor away, it will begin to transform the body.

Contemplating what story to tell, at almost 10:00 pm, I thought back over my day. It was a long one, full of joys and appointments. I showed property, climbed stairs, crawled in and out of the car multiple times, trotted across parking lots, got drenched during a thunderstorm, sat for extended periods of time, shared meals with grandkids. None of those activities are unusual, except that two and a half years ago, I would not have been able to put in such a day. The reoccurring thought that I entertained today was one of gratitude for my legs. This is a story about legs.
For years I took my legs for granted. They got me around and I never gave them much thought, beyond occasional dissatisfaction with the way they looked or the fact that I toe in when I walk, due to my hip joints.
After a serious car accident in 1995, I became much more aware of my legs because of damage to my low back. Inflammation set in, in my sciatic nerves, and thus began my journey with chronic pain.
I can’t adequately describe the agony of living with chronic pain. Sitting, standing, and walking were all uncomfortable. Muscles tightened around my knees, to the point that those joints would lock and not want to straighten out if I sat or slept with legs bent. They tightened in my calves as well. My nerves became so sensitive to touch that jeans and slacks against my skin created constant irritation and the soles of my feet could feel the texture of my socks. My feet didn’t like that. Restless legs kept me from sleeping well at night and long rides in the car or by airplane were unbearable.
As the years passed the pain increased, in spite of every kind of treatment imaginable. Doctors gave up. I gave up and learned to live with the pain and growing weakness in my legs. In 2015 it became necessary for me to use a cane to walk and a wheelchair seemed inevitable.
That was the lowest point, in this story about legs. That’s when I cried out, at a heart and soul level, for help. My cries were heard, and an answer given.
I found Anthony William by way of Facebook. I read his first book, Medical Medium, and my life changed, because my health changed. I discovered that the shingles virus had attacked my sciatic nerves, and that I could heal by avoiding foods that feed the virus, and consuming foods that support and heal the body. (Read more about healing foods.)
Switching to a plant based diet began a healing journey that continues today. In the last two years I’ve completely eliminated the shingles virus, healed inflamed nerves in my legs, strengthened weakened muscles, loosened stiff joints, eased nerve sensitivity and said bye bye to chronic pain, the cane and restless legs syndrome. Amazingly, something even shifted in my hip joints because I don’t toe in as much as I used to.
I can easily cross my legs, put on my shoes, stretch out my legs, climb stairs, squat and walk…all activities that had become impossible for me. I’m still careful going down stairs as that has been the most difficult thing for me to do, however I can manage, and as my legs continue to improve stairs are less and less problematic.
The thought I’ve had repeatedly the last two months is these don’t feel like my legs anymore. I love how great my legs feel and how well they work. Taking them for granted will never happen again. I say “thank you” to my legs, to the Divine and to Anthony every day.
My healing journey inspires me to help others who are struggling with health problems or chronic pain and disorders or who have given up, thinking they will never feel good again. There is hope. And my intention is to share that hope. The work I am doing now is leading me down the path of making a difference for others.
As I drove home tonight, I opened my library of songs on my iPhone and hit “shuffle”. I call this game Spirit Songs and I asked the Divine to select the songs I most needed to hear. The tunes that popped up were all perfect. I knew I had time for one more song before I arrived home. I asked the Divine to select the last song. Make it a great one, I whispered.
The next song up was Dancing Queen from the Mama Mia soundtrack. Of course, the Queen reference made me laugh. But as I listened intently to the words, tears filled my eyes.
A story about legs…it has a happy ending, or it will have, because this story is still being told, my healing is ongoing.
Now though, I can dance, I can jive, I AM having the time of my life. Watch this girl as the scenes unfold. I am the dancing queen.
This is not the story I thought I’d be writing tonight, however it’s the one that asked to be written. On Instagram, in the health conscious community that I am part of, Anthony William, also known as the Medical Medium, issued an invitation. He encouraged all of us to incorporate more berries into our lives, proclaiming July as Berry Challenge month.
I eat berries every day, adding frozen strawberries or wild blueberries to my morning smoothies. I loved the idea though of consciously choosing to include more berries in my diet daily, which is especially easy to do during this time of summer abundance. All berries have nutritional value, so I’ve been purchasing blackberries from the Farmer’s Market, and fresh strawberries and big bags of frozen wild blueberries from the grocery store.
Berries are so good for us, high in antioxidants that slow the aging…or dying…process while delivering phytochemicals, amino acids, coenzymes, vitamins and minerals to the body. I could go on about the health benefits of these amazing little fruits…and I will…just not in this blog post.
What’s been extraordinary during this first week of the Berry Challenge is seeing all the posts and photos on Instagram from people around the world who are participating as well, by eating more berries. Children, adults, seniors, men, women, families, groups of friends, even pets are all captured in beautiful pictures as they pick berries or purchase them, eat them or share them.
I was moved, in a deep and profound way, as I clicked the like button on photo after photo last night. I felt strong connections between all of us, as we make healthy choices and reap the results in our bodies. The thought came to me that we are healing individually and collectively, and the higher vibrational energy created brings a level of healing to the world.
A few minutes ago, out of curiosity, I looked at the chapter on berries in the Life Changing Foods book by Anthony. I’ll share more of the health benefits this week in my Journey With Health Me blog. Tonight, I read instead about the emotional support and spiritual lessons that berries offer.
Anthony writes that emotionally, berries hold unique powers to offer relief from distraction, uncertainty, lack of focus, fogginess, puzzlement and confusion. They bring healing to the conscious and subconscious, physical and metaphysical, mind and soul.
Spiritually, berries teach us about abundance. From spring until fall there’s never a gap in berry offerings as different varieties come into season. Berries grow low to the ground, making them accessible to animals and birds and people. There’s enough for everyone. When we consume berries that attribute of generosity becomes a part of us, so we can be givers and not just takers.
Those lessons explain what I’ve been feeling the last few days, after eating more berries for a week. These fruits heal on many different levels, boosting energy, raising the body’s frequency, grounding us when we pick them. That’s what I’m experiencing. Connection. Greater awareness. Higher vibrational energy. Clarity. Expansiveness in my soul.
I snapped a beautiful photo of my own today, of a simple bowl of strawberries and blackberries, in a pottery bowl crafted by a local artist. I enjoyed my berries while seated at a vintage picnic table, in my backyard garden. It was pure bliss…and so healing for my body, mind and spirit.
This post falls under the category of Health Story, and it will serve double duty, as I will share this post on the Journey With Healthy Me blog as well. Two years ago this month, I embarked on a healing journey that has completely transformed my life. Here is a recap on the healing that occurred during year one, and an update with the continued healing that has taken place in the last 12 months.
My healing journey began with a desperate prayer for help. After suffering with chronic sciatica and pain in my legs for 20 years, after a car accident, my left leg deteriorated, requiring me to walk with a cane. The pain and the tightness in leg joints and muscles continued to worsen. I struggled to walk at all, or sleep, or even straighten out my legs. A wheelchair seemed inevitable.
I asked the Divine for help and help arrived the next day, via an article by Anthony William, the Medical Medium. He wrote that a traumatic incident, such as a car accident, could create injuries that do not heal and chronic pain. His words described me and my condition. Thankfully, he offered hope. I ordered Anthony’s books, and immediately began a 28 day healing cleanse, eating raw fruits and vegetables. I saw such remarkable improvements after 28 days that I adopted a plant based lifestyle and never looked back.
I avoided meat, eggs, dairy, sugar, gluten, soy, corn (unless non GMO) and canola oil. And I ate fruits, vegetables, brown rice, legumes, nuts and seeds. The problem, I discovered from Anthony, was that the viruses I had in my body…some since childhood…were wreaking havoc. The shingles virus was the culprit that attacked my sciatic nerves. Epstein Barr and strep had infected my liver and thyroid, and other organs and body systems. My action plan was two fold: eliminate the viruses by avoiding the foods that feed them and support my immune system with healthy, wholesome food.
With such amazing changes in my health, I chose to remain plant based. Returning to my old way of eating would mean a return to my old way of feeling unwell. I’m not willing to sacrifice my health, ever again.
My mainstays this past year, as my healing journey continues, are celery juice first thing in the morning, followed by a fruit smoothie. At least 3-5 times a week, that breakfast smoothie is a heavy metals detox blend of wild blueberries, bananas, Hawaiian spirulina, cilantro, Atlantic dulse, chaga mushroom powder, barley grass juice powder, aloe vera gel and hemp seeds. I eat fruits and veggies, and add brown rice, legumes, nuts and seeds to round out my diet. I sip on lemon or lime water, ginger water, juices and herbal teas throughout each day.
My meals are simple, beautiful, and full of health boosting nutrients. I rarely eat out, preferring to prepare meals at home. A desire that I expressed, to cook more, is being fulfilled with this lifestyle.
In the past 12 months, my health has continued to improve. I’ve experienced healing of these symptoms/disorders:
My skin is clear and healthy. My hair texture has improved, and although it’s hard to tell in photos, as my silver hair reflects more light, I swear my hair is darkening up. I have more dark strands of hairs growing in, than I did a year ago. My legs feel so incredibly good that they amaze me every day. I continue to see improvements in flexibility and strength in both legs. I am energetic, have mental clarity and operate at a high vibrational frequency.
I’ve come to understand how marvelously and wonderfully made my body truly is. It is a finely tuned sensor, that lets me know if I need the nutrients in a certain food, or if I accidentally ingest something I shouldn’t. I trust my body. I listen to it. I respect it. I nourish it and care for it like I never have before. And I’m mindful of what I put on my skin and in my home. I’ve been eliminating chemicals and toxins by switching to natural cleaning, laundry and bath products.
To celebrate my two year anniversary, I climbed into my favorite tree…the redbud in my front yard, something I couldn’t do two years ago. This tree survived the Joplin tornado in 2011, when thousands of trees perished. My redbud twisted and lost branches and now bears scars…but its deep roots held. The redbud tree is symbolic of my own experience. I’ve survived my own storm, one that lasted many years. I twisted, parts of me broke, and I bear scars as well, however, I am strong and determined, and healing continues.
This exciting journey is ongoing with health and wellbeing my priorities. It’s onward and upward from here.
When I began my plant based journey almost two years ago, I entered into unfamiliar territory, alone. I had the books of Anthony William to guide me as I made changes. And soon Greg and my mom joined me by shifting their diets as well. We were a tiny band of plant based eaters.
Dr. Mark Hyman wrote, “The power of community to create health is far greater than any physician, clinic or hospital.”
I’ve learned these past 23 months just how crucial it is to be surrounded by a group of like minded people, who are headed in the same general direction. I’ve found an amazing online health-minded community, on Instagram. We encourage each other every day, posting photos of our glasses of celery juice and the latest healthy recipe we’ve tried. We ask each other questions and reach out for help if the day is rough. I greatly value the input of each person and make sure I communicate frequently with as many people as I can. Although we are scattered around the world, we have figuratively locked arms and we are walking each other home.
I thought that online health community might be the only one I could find. How beautiful it has been to be led to others in the Joplin area who are on a similar journey.
I met Robin Jeep several months ago, when she invited me to join a group of people and watch the documentary Eating You Alive at the local movie theater. I was excited about the invitation. I wanted to see the film, but I was even more excited to connect with others in my area who have embraced a plant based lifestyle. It turned out I knew several people who attended the documentary that night.
Robin, who is a plant based chef and founder of the Vibrant Living Society, has been great to offer classes, educating people on the difference a change in diet can make in improving health. This evening she hosted a plant based potluck dinner. Everyone contributed to the meal. I cut up a watermelon, one of my favorite summertime meals, and shared it. Robin demonstrated making a plant based lasagna that we sampled. It was delicious!
We had planned to watch the film Forks Over Knives together. That didn’t happen tonight. Instead, we got to know each other. Some in the room have been plant based for several years or more. Some switched two months ago. Two have completed three weeks so far, eating more fruits and veggies. And some have not yet made the full commitment, but they are curious and open.
And we shared stories. They ranged from wanting to heal to in the process of healing to full healing. I appreciated the earnestness and sincerity of everyone there. I held those who are just beginning their healing journeys, or who stand on the edge of taking that leap, with great compassion. And I applauded, literally, those who have turned their lives around.
I look forward to being part of this growing, healing, questing community, in my own hometown. We are strengthening each other.

St. Patrick’s Day may bring to your mind little men dressed in green, standing near a pot of gold with a rainbow behind them. However, this is not the true image of St. Patrick's Day as history recorded it. The real story of St. Patrick is one of a man of God standing for the truth in his day and age and bringing the Word to a country rampant with pagan worship and false gods.
St. Patrick was a British boy, born to a respectable family in England. At the age of 16 he was taken prisoner by Irish raiders who stormed his village. They brought him to Ireland and sold him into slavery. It was while he was in captivity as a sheep herder that he found the Lord and surrendered his life to Him. He escaped from his captors and went back to England. After a period of time, a great burden came back on his heart to bring the Gospel back to Ireland. The fire in his heart for the Gospel would be needed to bring the Word to people who were controlled by Druid priests and pagan worship and magic.
God used St. Patrick to ignite the spread of the Gospel throughout all of Ireland. St. Patrick lived during the time of St. Martin who was the church age messenger to the Pergamos church age. St. Patrick preached similarly to St. Martin and Paul’s message. Much of Ireland's Christian heritage is controlled by Catholicism in modern day Ireland, but the roots of Christianity were laid by St. Patrick, a man of God who stood for the truth of the Word.
One of the most amazing things about St. Patrick is that he followed the burden the Lord placed on his heart. He gave up being home again and the chance to live a normal Christian life to go back to his captors and bring them the Gospel. For St. Patrick, surrendering to that leading led to the salvation of countless Irish pagans to the Lord.
Always follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in your life. The eternal destiny of someone could rest upon your surrender to the Lord’s will.
Now, most everyone back there, those people died out in the… These men like Irenaeus, and Martin, and Columba, and they faded out. And now you take anybody that wants to search back any history you wish to, if it's an authentic history, and when they tell you that "Saint Patrick was a Catholic," they don't know what they're talking about. Saint Patrick protested the Catholic church, and never went to Rome, and firmly refused their doctrine. That's exactly right. You go to northern Eng-… or Ireland today, and you'll see the same thing. Saint Patrick was a man of God! But, Saint Patrick, when it said in there that he—he chased all the snakes out of Ireland, that was a legend.

What started out as innocent child's play turned into a near fatal incident when two children were attacked by a dog in Alpine Meadows.One girl was in serious condition with multiple bites around her torso and was airlifted to Reno last week while the other girl was taken to Tahoe Forest Hospital. Though the girls are recovering, the fate of the dog remains unknown.
Nine-year old Allyssa Hilker went over to her friend Marylou Warner's house in Alpine Meadows after school to play. The fourth-graders headed down to Bear Creek to a tree house when they spotted a dog they had never seen before -- a 120-pound, 10-month-old Rottweiler, Allyssa said Wednesday. The dog started fighting with Marylou's puppy, a yellow Lab named Vanilla. Then all of a sudden, the Rottweiler pounced on Allyssa, firmly clamping its teeth around her back, and dragged her into the creek, shaking her like a rag doll.
Allyssa doesn't recall exactly what happened next, but she does remember the screams of her friend. Three construction workers who were working nearby also heard the cries and rushed to the girls, pulling the dog off of Allyssa. Brad Krommenhoek and Brian Schneider, who work for Krommenhoek Masonry, kicked and sat on the dog. But the dog was not finished. When the men got off the dog, it jumped up and bit Marylou on the leg. After that, the men had had enough. After a few more kicks and punches, they tied the dog up in Marylou's garage.
North Tahoe Fire Protection District medics found Allyssa crying but remarkably calm for a child.Allyssa had significant wounds to her mid-chest area, under her arm, and around her back. In addition to chunks of skin missing, Hopwood was concerned that the lining surrounding her lung could have possibly been punctured. She was airlifted to Washoe Medical Center in Reno.Allyssa had more than 40 puncture wounds, in addition to scrapes and bruises, and had to have 50 stitches. Surgery was performed to clean out the lacerations and she was released the following day.Marylou had a single bite to her thigh and was taken to Tahoe Forest where she received five stitches.
Placer County Animal Control took custody of the Rottweiler, but it took 24 hours to find the dog's owner. Watterworth said the owner, whose name was not released, was apologetic and offered help. According to Watterworth, the owner normally keeps the dog locked inside but that morning it somehow got out.
Animal Control is holding the dog for a 10-day quarantine period as mandated by state law. The agency does not plan to release the dog. If the owner decides to claim the dog, the agency is looking into filing vicious animal charges against him. In that case, a court will decide the fate of the dog. If the owner voluntarily gives up the dog, it will be euthanized. According to Animal Control Officer Peter Krengel, no crime was committed so no charges are presently being filed against the owner.

4. There is a set of social skills that children need to learn and practice in order to be successful. They form the acronym CARES – cooperation, assertion, responsibility, empathy, self-control.
Teachers and administrators must model the social and academic skills that they wish to teach their students.
The approach to rules and discipline described in the Responsive Classroom Approach is neither autocratic nor permissive. Often referred to as an efficacious, positive, or judicious approach, it aims to help children develop self-control, begin to understand what socially responsible behavior is, and come to value such behavior. It does not rely on punishment or rewards to “get students to behave.” Neither does it ignore behavior that is detrimental to the child or to the group. Rather, this approach offers clear expectations for behavior and actively teaches children how to live up to those expectations. When children break rules, the teachers help children recognize and fix the problems their actions may have caused.
Teachers using this approach strive to be firm, kind, and consistent in their approach to rules and rule breaking. Their aim is to create calm, safe, and orderly classrooms – one where teachers can teach and children can learn – while preserving the dignity of each child.
This requires a constant balancing of the needs of the group with the needs of the individual, the need for order with the need for movement and activity, the need for teachers to be in control of the classroom with the need for students to be in control of their own lives and learning. It requires taking the time to teach children how to be contributing members of a caring learning community.
Just as teachers don’t expect children to come to school knowing how to read and write, teachers using this approach don’t make assumptions about the social skills children bring to school. Some children will come to school with highly developed social skills and many years of experience being part of a large group. Others will need to start from the beginning.
School provides an ideal setting for social learning. There are endless opportunities at school for children to learn to control their impulses and to think about the needs and feelings of others. Whether they’re learning to wait their turn to talk, ask politely for markers, welcome a newcomer into a group, or disagree with someone’s ideas without attacking them personally, school is rich with opportunities for children to learn to think and act in socially responsible ways. The time teachers spend on classroom rules is an investment that will be richly repaid.
Rather than being “handed down from above”, rules in these classrooms and schools are created collaboratively with students and teachers during the early weeks of school. Not only are students more motivated to follow rules that they’ve helped to create, but in the process of creating the rules students learn much about the role of rules in a democratic society. They are better able to understand that the rules are there to keep them safe and help them achieve their goals in school.
One of the most effective ways of building trust in the classroom is through a special kind of meeting: Morning Meeting, a fifteen-to thirty-minute whole-class gathering at the beginning of each day. This routine is simple, yet powerfully establishes a positive climate for learning, reinforcing academic and social skills, and giving students daily practice in showing respect, empathy, cooperation, and self-control. Morning Meeting works as a form of proactive discipline because it satisfies children’s need for a sense of significance, belonging, and fun. Much social science research has confirmed that in all human beings. Behavior is motivated by these intrinsic needs. Children will always strive to fulfill these needs. If they can’t find positive or constructive ways to fulfill them, they’ll seek unproductive and even destructive ways. Morning Meeting offers this all-important positive outlet and it sets the tone for the rest of the day.
Our class is busy developing into a caring learning community. We begin each day with Morning Meeting, a twenty-minute gathering during which we practice some of the academic skills we’re working on as well as important social skills such as listening, speaking, problem solving, and group participation.
1. Greeting: Children greet each other by name. The greetings are structured and often include shaking hands, clapping, singing, and other activities.
2. Sharing: A few children share news and interests, usually personal news, and respond to each other, articulating their thoughts, feelings, and questions in a positive manner.
4. Morning Message: Students practice academic skills and build their sense of community by reading and discussing a daily message written by the teacher.
3. Morning Meeting motivates children by addressing two human needs: the need to feel a sense of significance and belonging and the need to have fun.
Taken from The Morning Meeting Book by Roxann Kriete and Parents and Teachers Working Together by Carol Davis and Alice Yang
Sharing is an important part of our Morning Meeting. It is a structure in which students present news they wish to share and respond to each other by asking questions and offering comments.
2. Helps students develop the ability to gauge the appropriateness of sharing various kinds of news with different audiences
Abstract: MapReduce was introduced by Google in 2004. Thanks to its functional programming abstraction and fault-tolerant distributed framework, MapReduce makes easy to write parallel programs. In 2004 MapReduce was mostly used for web indexing; however nowadays we are seeing different type of applications (relational, graphs or machine learning analytics for example) which does not fit well within the MapReduce paradigm. In this talk I will use some research projects I have been working on in the past years to (1) introduce Apache Spark and Apache REEF; (2) describe how relational, graphs and machine learning applications can be efficiently run at scale using such systems; and (3) illustrate system's pros, cons and design choices.

For the third season running, Bryan Fuller et al have managed to shock us silent with the revelations and twists that bring the season to the close. With this finale possibly being a bit more final than the other two, we discuss whether it’s possible it could’ve ended better, worse, or even differently. We discuss the omissions from the Red Dragon arc, and whether they were necessary to begin with, and dig deeper into the #Hannigram.
All on this episode of Eat The Rudecast, a podcast about NBC’s Hannibal, and the works of Thomas Harris.
The breakdown of scenes from Manhunter, Red Dragon, and Hannibal is here: https://vimeo.com/137513763
We’re joined by an out of town friend, fan of the podcast and the show, Raina, as we discuss the penultimate episode of our season (hopefully not series). Raul Esparza gives his best performance of the series, Richard Armitage creates an otherworldly persona through movement and vocalizations as he truly becomes the dragon. We speculate on the end of this season, discussing what will become of Will Graham. And we talk about Meatloaf. Just ‘cuz.
Formerly NBC’s Hannibal goes far off-book with this episode, taking us to a place where we smug book readers are just as uncertain about what is to come in the final two episodes of the season. The Red Dragon is thrown at Will’s family in a tense scene of stalking, Hannibal spends as much time as possible fucking with everybody around him, and Will is absolutely done with both Jack Crawford and former BFF Hannibal Lecter.
We’re halfway through the Red Dragon arc on Hannibal, and are being given both stunning beauty in the scenes between Dolarhyde and Reba, and stunning acts of CGI crappery (see the below CGI teeth). We go off on several tangents, Cooper calls some fans hipster douchebags and spends a good four minutes angrily ranting about the aforementioned terrible CGI. Find more information about The Great Red Dragon paintings of William Blake here.
The Red Dragon arc reaches the beauty that separates this work of fiction from so many in this genre with the introduction of Reba McClain (Rutina Wesley) and beginning to peel back the story of Francis Dolarhyde. Meanwhile Will and Hannibal begin a dance of working together in their own family, as Hannibal remembers his building of a family with surprise guest Kacey Rohl as Abigail Hobbes, and Will clings to the relaxed comfort of his family. Miko returns to the table with Cooper & Ophilia, and they’re all around the same table again!
We’re joined by Kate Kulzick from Sound on Sight‘s Hannibal podcast This is Our Design joins us to discuss the rise of The Great Red Dragon, as Miko completes her summer walkabout in a vacation home with poor wifi. Cooper is a bit jarred by the transition from pretentious seventies foreign film first half of the season to (relatively) straight forward procedural adaptation of the first book of the Hannibal Lecter series Red Dragon. We marvel at an almost silent introduction of our new character Francis Dolarhyde played by Richard Armitage.
An episode that could very well be the series finale, as it brings us all the way up to the beginning of the Thomas Harris novels (excluding Hannibal Rising). The Italy portion of this season comes to a close, as does Mason Verger’s story line. This episode brings us some of the most bizarre and upsetting imagery of the series, which says a lot. All in all a superb episode of television that doesn’t pull a single punch in wrapping up its ongoing stories.
The Francis Bacon painting we spoke about in the episode, entitled Study after Velázquez’s Portrait of Pope Innocent X
Everything comes to a head in Florence, as Hannibal’s time there is nearly at an end. Bedilia puts her drug and confusion filled plan into effect, Mason, Margot, & Alana go to plan B, and Will is briefly reunited with Jack, before getting to the reunion we’ve all been waiting for.
The tragic hubris of Inspector Pazzi comes to a head in an episode that gave us severe déjà vu from the film version of Hannibal. We lament that his story was rather brief, and a single line change from the text leads Cooper down a complaint path to Watchmen. In the mean time Will and Chiyoh take the dream train through Narnia, and Jack says goodbye to Bella in Italy. This all leads to another fantastic fight scene, the ultimate throwdown between Hannibal and Jack, who no longer has any fucks to give.
A bang up episode that finds Chilton running his Avengers Initiative, Dead Abigail, and post Red Dinner origins for all of our characters. We meet Joe Anderson’s version of Mason Verger and are quite pleased, as well as find out what happened (in brutally graphic fashion) to Frederick Chilton post Miriam Lass intervention last season. The only thing keeping this from being in the top five episodes of Hannibal is the sheer lack of the man himself, seen in flashbacks, fantasies, and epistolary cutaways.
So, now the question: Did Hannibal kill and eat his younger sister Mischa? Was she his first victim? This is the major overarching discussion of this third episode of Hannibal’s third season. Cooper is a bit exhausted by the slowness and didn’t initially like the episode. Miko & Ophilia are a bit more on board thanks to firefly symbolism. Jack Crawford makes his way to Italy, Will heads to “the place Hannibal can never go,” visiting Stately Lector Manor in Lithuania and meeting Chiyoh, the new addition to the cast, and Hannibal does a lot of entertaining, and some stabbing.
At once an episode full of hallucinations and dream logic, and an episode that follows a very straight forward timeline. Will Graham wakes up after the events of the Red Dinner and heads to Italy himself. There he encounters Inspector Pazzi from the novel Hannibal. Will seeks Hannibal both for closure, and for comfort, to offer forgiveness.
And we’re back! Hannibal roars back onto our screens on a motorcycle in Paris, stalking his prey. This tremendous season opener written by Bryan Fuller & Steve Lightfoot, and directed by Cube director Vincenzo Natali wastes no time in proclaiming Season 3 to be an entirely different beast than seasons 1 and 2. The adventures of The Fells, Hannibal & Bedelia DuMaurier, in first Paris, then Florence, are stunning achievements of television, as well as looping back in time so we can spend a significant amount of time with our old friend Dr. Gideon. Can’t wait for episode 2!
We are joined at the table once again by Kate Kulzick from Sound On Sight, The Televerse Podcast, and our progenitor the This is Our Design Hannibal podcast. The reason for our expanded table is that we have arrived at the finale! Tonight, the throw down happens, and we get resolution that is both beautiful and horrible, painful and exquisite. Cooper unabashedly calls this the greatest episode of television he’s ever experienced. The Jack/Hannibal confrontation we glimpsed 12 episodes ago comes to horrible fruition, the waters surrounding which side Will is on grow murkier, and there’s a fateful date with a linoleum knife.
All on this episode of Eat The Rudecast, an unauthorized podcast about NBC’s Hannibal, and the works of Thomas Harris.
This is the final episode of Eat The Rudecast for this season, but we will return next summer when the show returns. In the meantime, Damn Good Podcast is coming, as Cooper, Miko, & Ophilia deconstruct Twin Peaks.
Mason Verger is disturbed to find himself not the star of a show called Verger, but merely the “little-bad” on a show called Hannibal. The final pieces are put in place for the epic season finale, and a guest star returns.
We can barely contain our excitement as Hannibal has multiple sessions with Mason Verger, the reveal and deveal of Freddie Lounds fate occurs, the windego morphs into Shiva, and the game changes significantly for Will and Hannibal when it comes to Mason Verger.
We’re thrilled to meet Mason Verger, played by Michael Pitt, as our story kicks over into end game and mini-series blasts its way toward the fight conclusion. This episode offers one of the most unnerving tableaus in the sabertooth Randal Tier display, and a thrilling climax that involves Will cutting the ginger.
From the opening fantasy sequence where Will uses his ravenstag to kill Hannibal/Wendigo, through the expansion of the Margot Verger subplot, to the most raw KOW (killer of the week) in Randall Tier, the beast, the mechanical cave bear, we adore this episode. Even if it does have one of the most unusual and abrupt endings of the series.
A treat of an episode filled with guest stars Katherine Isabelle, Jeremy Davies, and Chris Diamantopoulos. We spend the first ten minutes discussing the character of Margot Verger and the differences between the books, movies, and this series, and Bryan Fuller’s versions of a character that was a bit of a stereotype in Thomas Harris’ work. Beyond that we get the strangest killer of the week scenario involving a horse and womb.
Poor Frederick Chilton. After Will gets released and a severely damaged Miriam Lass returns to the FBI, Hannibal figures now is the time to pull the trigger on his “fall guy,” setting up Chilton.
A hell of an episode advances all the plotlines while taking a significant turn to the beautiful surreal of experimental films. We discuss the validity of the Hannibal/Alana storyline, the reality of the cages in the BSHCI, and the beauty of the food at Hannibal’s dinner party.
Check out Hannibal‘s food stylist Janice Poon’s blog for sketches and stories of the creation of this amazing food.
We return from weeks of illness and vacation and illness again to a really cracking puzzle box of an episode that unfolds and unfolds with more plot points than we can even be prepared for. We bid a farewell to Beverly Katz as she has been deconstructed by Hannibal. Cooper feels that this is the episode where Hannibal becomes magic, but is willing to make the leap. We’re thrilled to see the returning Abel Gideon (“We thought you were dead!”) and Frederick Chilton continues to make Cooper giggle.
We marvel at the dichotomy that a very strong episode with a slammin’ finale could have so many clunky scenes. Beverly behaving as a greatly dumbed down version of herself is a red flag. We all fawn over the naivety of Chilton and I put forth that Hannibal doing a Punch and Judy style hand-puppet show in a dream sequence in season 3 would be the best thing ever!
As Season 2 of Hannibal moves into the courtroom drama phase, the girls both really like what’s being offered up, while Cooper grumps about the show not feeling enough like itself. We talk of the gory murders, guest star defense attorney, the return of Dr Chilton and Freddie Lounds, and more gloriously gory tableaus.
Hundreds took to the street of downtown Santa Ana to protest the removal of DACA on Sept. 5, 2017 in Santa Ana, Calif.
The measures demanded by President Donald Trump to save the young immigrants protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program would create another immigration casualty: investor visas that have channeled hundreds of millions of dollars into South Florida development.
The perpetually endangered EB-5 visa — which narrowly escaped death last month when Congress extended it to December, days before it was set to expire — would be eliminated in Trump’s proposed immigration reforms.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claims Iran was "brazenly lying" when it said it never had a nuclear weapons programme.Mr Netanyahu says Iran has continued to preserve and expand its nuclear weapons knowledge for future use after signing the 2015 nuclear deal, officially named the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.The deal granted Tehran relief from international economic sanctions in return for curbs to its nuclear programme.But Mr Netanyahu says Iran did not honour the agreement and instead just intensified its efforts to hide its secret files after signing the deal."Tonight I'm here to tell you one thing: Iran lied," Mr Netanyahu told a news conference in Tel Aviv.Iran's foreign minister Javad Zarif says Mr Netanyahu's allegations are old and have already been dealt with by t...
March 27 (UPI) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent medical evaluation at a hospital in Ein Karem on Thursday after he experienced a high fever and cough, his office said.Doctors were considering keeping the premier overnight for evaluation after a series of tests at Hadassah University Medical Center. He traveled to the hospital in his car, not an ambulance."He is going through initial tests and once completed, the hospital will issue a statement on his condition," hospital officials said.Netanyahu's physician, Dr. Tzvi Berkowitz said he didn't rest enough after having the flu two weeks ago and his symptoms worsened. During his illness earlier in the month, Netanyahu worked from home for six days and missed his scheduled questioning for one of three corruption cases in w...
Israeli police on Tuesday recommended indicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in two corruption investigations, a move that could lead to the first indictments after months of corruption investigations focusing on the prime minister and his family. Israeli police said in a statement they had "sufficient evidence" against the prime minister in both cases "for the offense of accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust." Israeli police alleged Netanyahu received at least 1 million shekels, around $ 283,000, in lavish gifts and bribes. Case 1,000 alleges that Netanyahu accepted gifts from wealthy patrons in return for advancing their interests. In so-called Case 2,000, Netanyahu is accused of striking a deal with Israel's second largest newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth, to provide h...
Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says he expects European countries to follow the US in recognising Jerusalem as his country's capital.He is in Brussels for talks - the first time an Israeli prime minister has visited the city in more than 20 years.But the EU's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini says the bloc's stance on the matter is unchanged.Donald Trump's move has left the US isolated on a highly sensitive issue between Israel and the Palestinians.Arriving in Brussels, Mr Netanyahu again welcomed the announcement, saying Jerusalem had been the capital of the Jewish people for 3,000 years and Mr Trump had put "facts squarely on the table"."I believe that all, or most, European countries will move their embassies to Jerusalem, recognise Jerusalem as Israel's capital and engage robustl...
The occurrence site of Mukden incident which became the direct trigger of the Manchurian Incident. On the night of September 18, 1931, Nakuuchi Kawamoto, an independent garrison garrison at Shenyang, ignited the explosive here aimed at a full iron wire. This was made by the Chinese army to create an excuse for occupation of “Manchuria” military force. A monument was built by the Japanese side during the “Manchukuo” era, but after the war, it was overthrown by the Chinese side. Currently, the monument is “the nineteenth and eighteenth calendar monument”, and “9, 18 incident change display hall” is established in the hopeful flower street nearby. Today, near the scene, a memorial hall is newly constructed and open to the public, with the Chinese side “Nine-eighteen residual calendar monument”. It is in liu tiao hu of Yuan Ward, North Suburbs of the city.

There's a save pedestal just to the right of the city entrance, so go ahead and save your progress there if you like. Make sure that you check the long walkway beyond it to find a treasure chest that holds the Funny Mask. Then look to the left of the town's entrance. There's a building you can enter (marked on the map as a merchant's shop), but just to the left of that is an opening to pass into a walled courtyard. If you enter the courtyard, you can find a chest that contains the Kabuki Doll. Grab that, then purchase anything you need from the merchant.
Now you have a slight choice about how to proceed. There are three points with blue aura that you can use to further explore the village. Each of those points lead to new portions of the village that currently don't have any attractions aside from huts with purple mist around them that signify enemy encounters. You will be warned away if you try to approach the huts.
Start with the central area that is through the main gate beyond the save point, you'll find a girl named Kagu who is being pestered by some demons. Save her by defeating the two weak demons and she'll become your partner. Now you can continue forward along the bridge to find a new scene. The Playhouse where she wanted you to take her is now known as Purgatory. Kagu says that you will find the rear entrance. Return to the save point and save if you like, then explore the area to the left of the item shop.
You'll now find two demons bothering a young woman. Defeat them to save her, then start forward and you'll meet with Raiden. He explains a new system that you can put to use while Kagu is with you. The girl can see spirit floors that otherwise wouldn't be visible. A brief tutorial of sorts walks you through the process. Let Kagu cross, then use Vine magic to cross over with her. Now as you start forward, Kagu will point out that the back door to the building has been destroyed. Repair it with your brush, then step inside the Playhouse dungeon.
Head to the Dreamyard area, which is accessed by first traveling to Striaton City and then entering the forest along the northeast side. When you were here before, there were obstructions that prevented you from fully exploring the area. Now those obstructions are gone and you can access a special underground area near the area's upper right corner.
Descend the stairs to the underground area and you'll have to battle your way through while facing various trainers. Not all of them will attack. Some will try to flee if you get near. Winning battles against the high-level trainers can net you a lot of experience points, so you might not want to let them get out of your way. You can duck behind crates or portions of wall, then wait for them to run around and bump right into you so that a battle can occur.
When you explore the underground area with the trainers, make sure that you head to the lower right corner and ascend some stairs. You'll appear back outside. Head down and you'll find an old man hiding to the lower right, near some trees. His name is Gorm. He'll rush you as you find him. Talk to him and he'll hand over the TM75 Swords Dance. Then Looker will appear and take Gorm with him.
If it's Friday, note that the tall just north of the room where you battle all of the trainers is a great place to find wild Musharna creatures with the special Teleport ability that can't be obtained elsewhere. Gorm mentions them before Looker takes him away. You might want to spare a moment to recruit one before you continue your adventure.
Once you've used Fly and arrived at Solaceon Town, take a brief moment to find the Pokemon Center in town. Heal your Pokemon there, and then swing northward out of town and onto Route 210, continuing in this direction until you run into the four Psyducks that are blocking your path towards the yet-unexplored reaches of the road. Examine them, and you'll be given the option to use the Secret Potion that Cynthia earlier handed over to you. This mysterious potion will cure the Psyducks' headaches, and they'll scurry off. Cynthia will then show up. She'll hand you an Old Charm and ask you to deliver it to her grandmother in Celestic Town, which happens to be our next destination. But first, we must navigate this new section of Route 210.
The initial "new" part of Route 210 will lead you through some thick grass. This grass is full of Pokemon, but nothing that's new and exciting as of yet. Be sure to veer left through the grass to find a Max Repel, and in the very center of the grassy area, on a small sandy patch of land, a Hyper Potion can also be acquired. Once on the other end of the grass, go northward into the next area of Route 210, but be sure to examine the area to your right (surrounded by a less invasive form of grass) to grab a Nest Ball, which is tucked cleverly into a nearby corner. Also, be sure to scour that initial grassy area beyond where the Psyducks were earlier posted, since you'll be able to find three well-hidden trainers when you do.
The next part of Route 210 you encounter becomes somewhat of a nuisance, because it gets really foggy. You can use Defog here to clear the fog and make things easier for you. It's not the visibility being cut down that's the real pain, here, but rather that the fog will make you miss your attacks in battle from time to time, both with wild Pokemon and Pokemon sent out after yours by another trainer. Thankfully, the effect works both ways, hence negating it entirely. But still, use Defog and clear the air before battling any wild Pokemon or trainers, or fights will become longer and clumsier.
For now, you can't head north in this area; you'll simply have to head westward through some grass, where you'll encounter your first trainer battles of the area. You can dodge the grassy area completely if you smash through the sapling using Cut, but you may not have a Cut-capable Pokemon with you, in which case you'll simply have to go through the grass. Prior to the sapling, you should be able to find a couple of trainers that want to do battle (such as Ace Trainer Alyssa and her trio of Pokemon), and you should also be able to find a Red Shard in your vicinity. After those battles, use Cut to head westward from the sapling's location. Veer up some stairs towards a couple of people running in circles. These are trainers. After fighting a double team (a Gyarados and Raichu), you can climb some stairs heading upward and join a series of bridges that will essentially bring you the rest of the way westward towards Celestic Town, our next destination.
Traveling westward is fraught with danger. There are plenty of trainers to challenge you en route, with Ace Trainer Ernest and Veteran Brian packing the biggest punch. However, these trainers shouldn't provide you with a challenge that's overwhelming, even if they have fairly high-leveled Pokemon that are starting to close the gap with the Pokemon in your own active party. Keep in mind that you'll need to use your Bicycle to cross the thin wooden strip heading westward from the first bridge you encounter. You can then take another strip southward to an isolated platform. Use Rock Smash here and grab your prize, TM30.
Otherwise, you'll want to rejoin the main bridges heading westward. You'll ultimately need to cross three in total while battling various trainers you encounter. Be sure to veer off of the path when necessary to grab more items, including a Smoke Ball and four berries growing near the entrance to Celestic Town -- a Sitrus Berry, a Chesto Berry, a Wiki Berry and an Aguav Berry. There's plenty more to do here, but you don't have the tools necessary to do those things yet -- primarily the ability to walk on water and climb rocks. So, when we have those abilities, we'll return here. But in the meantime, you'll want to head westward into Celestic Town to continue.
Once in Celestic Town, the wild Pokemon encounters will all but come to an end for the time being, so rest easy. To ultimately proceed with our mission, we'll need to acquire the ability to use Surf, or more simply, walk on water. In the northwest corner of town, you can shop at the Poke Mart, and in the southeast corner of town, you can visit the Pokemon Center to heal your Pokemon and switch up your party if needed (be sure to battle Clown Lee here, and acquire the Great Ball from the man on the left side of the main floor as well). Otherwise, let the exploration begin immediately. Other than visiting the house in the southwest corner of the town to find a house where a piece of your Poketch, the Analog Watch can be found, you'll want to direct your attention towards the center of the town, where the ancient ruins are located.
At the entrance to the ruins, you'll have to do battle with a Galactic Grunt. The Galactic Grunt will come at you with a level thirty Golbat and a level thirty-two Houndour... in other words, nothing too extreme. Take his Pokemon out with ease, and then give the Old Charm to the elderly grandmother when she comes to visit you at the ruins thereafter. When you regain control, be sure to grab the Dragon Fang to your right, by using the staircase to reach it.
All won't be finished, however. The Galactic Grunt and his simplistic Pokemon were one thing, but how will you hold up when you have to deal with Galactic Boss Cyrus and his three powerful Pokemon? He'll engage you in battle as soon as the grunt is dispatched, so be ready to deal with him. He'll come packing three Pokemon -- a level thirty-four Sneasel, a level thirty-four Golbat and a level thirty-six Murkrow -- obviously, the latter is the most dangerous. Deal with his Pokemon, and hostilities will end for the time being.
With the Old Charm now given away and Cyrus sent packing, head inside the ruins and examine the ancient paintings on the north end of the small excavation site. The elderly grandmother who just took the Old Charm from you will come inside after you as you examine the artwork and hand over HM03, the Surf command! This will allow you to go on water, fighting new Pokemon in various areas, and more importantly, giving you access to all-new, unexplored areas.
After getting HM03, use Fly to teleport to Jubilife City. Heal your party and rearrange it if need be, and then swing westward out of town. This will lead directly to Route 218, a location we briefly explored very early in the game. But now that you're equipped with HM03 and can use Surf, you can walk on the water separating the route into two distinct segments. Thus, you can reach Canalave City on the other side in one piece.

The essence of Eckhart Tolle's message is easy to grasp: If we connect to the stillness within, we move beyond our active minds and emotions and discover great depths of lasting peace, contentment, and serenity. With his bestselling first book, The Power of Now, his message has reached millions of people worldwide. In this much anticipated follow-up, Tolle gives us the essence of his teaching in short, simple pieces that anyone can easily understand.
Stillness Speaks is organized into ten chapters whose subjects range from "Beyond the Thinking Mind" to "Suffering and the End of Suffering." Each chapter is a mosaic of individual entries, concise and complete in themselves, but profoundly transformative when read as a whole.
Eckhart Tolle understands the spiritual needs of our time. He draws from the essence of all spiritual traditions, expressing these truths in startlingly fresh new ways. The result is a book that is paradoxically both ancient and contemporary, filled with timely and powerful messages. Stillness Speaks can be no less than an awakening for readers willing to give the words a chance to work their quiet magic.
Eckhart Tolle is a contemporary spiritual teacher who is not aligned with any particular religion or tradition. In his writing and seminars, he conveys a simple yet profound message with the timeless and uncomplicated clarity of the ancient spiritual masters: There is a way out of suffering and into peace. Eckhart travels extensively, taking his teachings throughout the world. He lives in Vancouver, British Columbia.

So I'm just wondering how difficult it would be to transfer from a degree in computer engineering at curtin university to a double (arts and computer engineering) degree at unsw- after one year of study. I'm currently living in Perth, in year 12 with a predicted atar of 98 really want to study at unsw but unfortunately can't afford to move interstate at the moment. No universities in Perth offer a double in arts and computer engineering (yeah I know it's a weird combination.)
How difficult is it to transfer/ how competetive is it/ what kind of first year results would be required?
What credit transfers would I be able to get? Could I contact the universities to find this out or is this not really feasible until I've actually completed a year?
Would I just be better off working full time for a year and then applying under the guaranteed entry scheme (taking a gap year)?
sydney is very expensive and you will very likely struggle financially unless you're making like 500+/week
I'm seriously considering that. Only thing is my parents are going to get me to pay board unless I commence university inmediately. So I'm not sure how much more I'd be able to save working full time than if I worked part time while studying but not paying board.
to be honest if you're working full time, you can afford the board (idk how much parents charge like maybe $200?) but that will only be a small amount in comparison to what you will make full time
lets say you make $1000/week full time after tax, you'd have $800 savings which works out to be about $3k/month = about $35k by the end of the year. that would be a sufficient start in sydney.
I'd opt for the gap year imo. I doubt UNSW would have a lot of credit transfers from curtain anyways and that way if you have a decent atar, you can get straight in after the gap year
Yeah thanks for the advice. I think I'm going to take the gap year. Looking at the course outlines- curtin does a "general engineering" first year before focusing in on the actual specialisation while unsw just goes straight into the computer bit, so you're right- it's highly doubtful that there will be many credit transfers from that. Thanks again.
It would probably be easier to move from UWA to UNSW than from Curtin, since UWA & UNSW are both "group of 8" research universities, while Curtin is more of a tech uni - more applied.

We decided to build a lot more features into the software than planned, but we will definitely release the first beta soon.
What do you mean 'closed Beta'? Is it a beta that's finished, and no testing, or a beta that is 'as is' and we try it. Will it be for current Pro user or testers?
I would love to be considered for the closed beta. In addition to my audio engineering background, im also an application developer and may be able to provide some more in-depth feedback/troubleshooting.
Here is another short update. We have finished another software we will release shortly and we have installed it in the first radio stations. The "DRS 2006 Community Radio Manager".

As I promised in my last post, here’s more about that awesome Munchkin Step Diaper Pail attendees were sent to try. But first, here’s another look at me sitting in that sweet lil nursery Munchkin set up for us at Mom’s Night Out 2.0 — I don’t happen to be the kind of mom whose nursery looks that put-together all the time, so I won’t show you what our nursery actually looks like. Rest assured, it’s a mess, with onesies, toys, and boxes of diapers tossed everywhere (Hubba Hubby might kill me for admitting that, oops). But you know, it’s a real baby room with a real baby occupying space and getting her diaper changed there multiple, multiple times a day, and not a showroom just for us to take pictures!
Here’s a picture of just that awesome Munchkin Step Diaper Pail – one thing that remains the same in both this show-nursery and our nursery at home, though, is the presence of a diaper pail. Honestly, I know “back in the day” people just used regular garbage cans but the world is a far more pleasant-smelling place now with diaper pails trapping in those awful poopy diaper smells. I’m told it’ll get worse once baby starts on solids, but even now, the smell of ‘buttered popcorn’ can be overwhelming (y’all who have had babies and/or changed diapers… you know what I mean!!!). Having the Step Diaper Pail takes it one “step” farther (see what I did there?! … dads aren’t the only ones who make ‘dad jokes’) with a nifty foot pedal to make operation hands-free — so keep your baby safe with one hand on baby, one hand on the dirty diaper, and one foot on the pedal… easy-peasy!
I’m so glad we were sent a diaper pail; this makes nighttime diaper changes a breeze as we now have this diaper pail next to our 2nd changing station in our bedroom. No worrying about diapers stinking up our bedroom!

On the way back, I keep watch out the right window of the Sumo. A large chinar tree between here and Sangrama, they had said, and that was all the description I got. It was only later that it struck me, I don't even know what a chinar looks like.
In any case, about two-thirds of the way to Sangrama, we pass a large tree. Chinar or not, I have no idea. But it dominates the landscape hereabouts enough that it might be the correct one. And as a coda to my sighting it, as a reminder of a bloody day in 2001, there is a bicycle there, leaning against the tree. For one long instant, I have the feeling that I've been transported back to that day. That any second now, as we drive past, the bicycle will explode and send sharp bits of metal slicing into my flesh. As it once did to 38-year-old Major Abhimanyu Sikka, famous in these parts even then.
Returning from Sangrama, Sikka was driving when they passed the chinar tree: driving, and thus further from bike and tree than his mate in the passenger seat. But I'm told a flying piece of the bike passed by the passenger – how does that poor fellow feel? – and cut deep into Sikka's jugular vein. He was actually conscious for a while. Turned to ask how his men were, got out of the vehicle and checked if anyone needed help, radioed what had happened to their base unit only a few miles down the road, stood there for a while like that, talking quietly with his men and waiting for help, until he noticed he had blood down his front. His back. His fingers. His toes. His eyes. His nose. Faint from losing blood, he crumpled, never to rise again.
All this flashes through my mind as I register the presence of the bike, leaning lazily on the tree that might be a chinar. But of course, this bike doesn't explode. I relax, though I realize I've held my breath for a few seconds, I’m breathing hard. Our Sumo rumbles on towards Srinagar.
I came here seeking Abhimanyu Sikka, gone since May 2001. In how that bike made me feel for those few seconds, in the thoughts it put in my head all over again, I found him.
The road from Srinagar starts out like roads in most northern cities: raucous with traffic, dust everywhere, rubble and garbage, I cough and cough again. Sure, this is a pretty city. In parts. It is also a dreary one in other parts, and this route is one of them. Through Lal Chowk and Batmaloo, we crawl even early in the morning, past knots of people looking for rides, through messes of cars and bikes and buses and Qualises. At one three-way junction on the outskirts, there is the familiar and pure chaos that results when such junctions are left untended and unsignalled.
Why Srinagar, my friends ask in wonder, why Kashmir? I feel oddly bashful offering the sole answer I have: I'm in search of patriotism. I'm worn out with the variety that only seems like phony posturing to me – the “love India or leave it”, “my country right or wrong” kind of rhetoric that is applauded as patriotism. I'm searching for different ways to look at this near-holy virtue, different ways it is experienced and lived. Even fought for.
I'm travelling for that. And if you're travelling in search of patriotism in India, the road leads inexorably to Kashmir. In the way it has become a litmus test of our feelings for our country, in the emotions it inspires in us, Kashmir is no-brainer patriotism. Naturally I want to visit, learn for myself what ticks over here. Yet what my friends also mean is the mundane question of safety. Is it really a good time to go to Kashmir? Is Srinagar safe? Can you trust those Kashmiri Muslims, don't they all hate us Indians?
So I get to Srinagar. I roam the city, take the buses with their guttural conductors, shop for shawls and dupattas, lunch on the leisurely lawns of the Amar Singh Club, watch football matches at the University, sit beside Dal Lake and write postcards, debate settling into a houseboat for a few days.
Yet what else is normal is what makes this city profoundly abnormal. I mean the immense presence of armed forces: soldiers every few metres, concrete bunkers festooned with rolls of barbed wire, guns cradled in alert arms everywhere you look.
And already this is a journey. From the chaotic certainties of Bombay, through the disorderly ostentation of Delhi, to this city of guns where it took me six – count 'em, six – different security checks to board a plane, where you must turn on your inside light if you're driving your car after dark, where the streets are dark after dark. And when I begin to experience some of this, I also begin to realize all it has done to what people here feel about a country. Come to Kashmir for the beauty and the chinar trees, but come too for a taste of that.
Rashid, who sold me two shawls on the Boulevard, has thought about this. “Koi hadd bhi hoti hai,” he begins. On the way home after a wedding, he weaved through a roadblock and came to a stop at a CRPF jawan who had his gun pointed at him. Where are you coming from, where are you going, why so late, the jawan barked. Rashid's simple answers – “wedding”, “home” and “weddings run late”, respectively – only annoyed the man, who brandished the gun some more. So after a while Rashid emerged carefully from his rusting Maruti. “Koi hadd bhi hoti hai,” he repeats to me. “These soldiers are all stupid goondas.”
He stood there, this balding, shambling, slightly flabby man. Pointed to his wife and kids, to his own belly, asked the jawan: “Why are you treating me like this? I'm Indian like you. Do I look like a terrorist?”
I get the unsettling feeling he is really asking me. Me, the travelling Indian whose easy ideas about patriotism also run into roadblocks in this place.
No, he doesn't look like a terrorist. But this is more normal stuff in this terrorist, tourist, town. And in some ways, it's in tales like this, of which there are plenty for a visitor to hear in Srinagar, that my search for Abhimanyu Sikka takes root.
Because the logical place these tales pointed to was the other end of those guns: those cradling arms, those eyes that look out from bunkers. What must it be like to be a soldier here? To be seen as a stupid goonda? To be on duty not knowing where the next terrorist might pop up? To peer at ordinary citizens along the barrel of a gun? What does it do to your ideas of serving the country? What must it be to sometimes die here?
Of Sikka, I knew only his cousin, who suggested that on one of my Srinagar trips, I might go see where he had died. Well, I also knew the village nearest where the bomb went off, Sangrama in Baramulla district, and the name of his unit. Armed with this much, my plan was simple: head for Baramulla and ask.
The road beyond the three-way junction arrows across placid Kashmiri plains, through stands of trees and past fields of grain. Not my idea of scenic, so I close my eyes again and doze. Awake some indeterminate time later, look out groggily to note we are speeding through a little chai-shop town called ... Sangrama. I croak to the driver, stop here stop here I want to get off!
Over biscuits I begin asking. Anyone know this man, he died in a blast around here a few years ago? Blank faces from the chai man, the STD owner, the CRPF post, the cloth seller. Soon, I realize my best option is to find my way to his unit, another 5 or 6 km down the road. A crowded minibus drops me there. Some searching questions, a patdown and a longish wait in a shed later, I'm in. I'm talking to a young major whose name isn't his name.
Here's my first clue to what it's like to be a soldier here: you don't use your real name. You don't say where your home is, your family is. For there have been times when the phone has rung in such homes and spewed threats at frightened wives and kids. It's only when the major and his friend, a younger captain, are persuaded that I am merely an itinerant writer, that I want to know something about a man still revered here – only then do they relax and tell me about assumed names and homes. And their real names and homes.
“Oh yes, Abhimanyu Sikka,” the major begins. “Yeah, I came here after his time, but I know about him. Our unit holds an Abhimanyu Sikka Memorial Cricket Tournament here every year, where local teams participate. You see, he was famous in this area, most of all among civilians. They had a name for him. Boba. In Kashmiri, that's 'mother.'“
No mere story. Talking to a local youth later that afternoon on the road outside, I ask if he knew Sikka. “Of course. Tall guy, nice guy. We all called him Boba.”
I'm beginning to sense that Sikka was an unusual sort. In this place, this calling, that is almost defined by violence and virility, this man had qualities of caring enough that he was called “mother”. It’s not unheard of: In far-off Tamil Nadu, there is a temple to Tayumanavar (“He who became a mother too”), Shiva in the form of a mother come to help her daughter in need. In Maharashtra, the poet-saint Dnyaneshwar is often called “Dnyanoba mauli”, “mother” again, for his gentle teachings on religion and philosophy. There are those venerated traditions, yes. But that a tough modern soldier, of all people, gets a name like that? He must have been unusual.
“In my CO's office,” says the major, “you'll find a picture of Abhimanyu. Next to it is another picture. Those are the bastards who killed him, after we killed them. That shot, we call it 'Abhimanyu Sikka Revenged.'“
The major invites me to join him and a few other officers for lunch, typically delicious Army fare. Beside me is the young captain. A smile plays on his lips as we talk about his profession. “It's hard work, sure. But you sleep at night with the satisfaction that you're doing what you were trained for.” He smacks a fist into the other palm. “When we go after a terrorist, it's like the hunter and the hunted, you know?”
The look on his face is, by now, nearly wistful; the smile almost bittersweet. Like you might reminisce about first love, this athletic young man gets misty-eyed about what he does every day. “The thrill of hunting, you know? And then we shoot the fucker down.”
I can't eat much. The food is good, I am hungry, I like this young man, I'm conscious of his sincerity, his passion, his spirit. You might say, his patriotism. But suddenly, I can't eat much.
We're on an arrow-straight road again. Another major, another assumed name, takes me another few kilometres to “Abhimanyu Post” that he now commands, successor to Sikka. There's a picture of Sikka on the wall in the office, my first look at the man I've been tracking all day. Boba wore glasses, I note. After tea, the major and I stroll out of the post. On either side of us are smart soldiers with guns, looking this way and that in wide-eyed trigger alert, protection detail for the two of us. But protection from whom? The people they are themselves charged with protecting?
We walk below tall shady trees to the footbridge that his men built across the trickling river behind the post. This is the most tangible memorial to Sikka, this bridge named after him. A slender, spare structure that, if you want to get to the other side, saves a long walk.
Sikka himself, the major tells me, pointing, used to roam those low slopes across the river. Every day, just him and one or two men, open and frank, meeting civilians and listening to them, getting to know them. He was a fine soldier – I remember another one, the captain with the wistful hunter’s gleam – and he saw this outreach to civilians as a vital part of his job. He did it well. He showed he cared. That's why Boba was so loved by people here.
A bridge to that other side: in this place of all places, it's a fine metaphor, and it has me humming lines from Dire Straits:
What was Abhimanyu Sikka's river, I wonder. The one that trails past below the bridge? The one that runs between a soldier's life of battle and tension and killing, and the less fraught lives the rest of us lead? The one between soldiering and reaching out to the people you soldier for? The gulf that says people not like us are stupid suspect monsters, merely for being not like us?
And I've travelled a long way in search of something called patriotism. In Kashmir, as I've heard stories and ridden the buses and drunk my chai, my own ideas of it have taken flight to places unknown, and that's been my real journey in this sometimes beautiful, always tragic land. But here where Boba roamed, from the hints I've had of this man's life, I think I'm beginning to understand. Understand him, understand what he says to me, and even understand Dire Straits’ Ride Across the River for the first time.
You reach out to the other guy, you ride across your river to the other side – and you know what your country really means to you. You know what patriotism means to you. And so on this trip, as I pass a bike that leans against a tree, holding my breath, I know I've journeyed as far as I'm going to. It's time now to go home.
Beside the Major Sikka Memorial Bridge, a plaque carries his name, as also the new major's name – which isn't his name. In Boba country, when you die for your country, you get your name back.
Postscript: You might want to read the short speech I gave at the Outlook/Picador award function in New Delhi in February.
Your piece was very well-written. The 2 main aspects I liked about it were the questions that you raised at the beginning of the piece (reg patriotism), and the final sentence - wot a killer punch!
While the piece seemed good, I had a feeling that it ended a bit abruptly. Maybe it could've been a little longer. I had expected it to dwelve deeper into how different people - Kashmiris, Army officers and Boba's relatives - saw Boba .. so that it would give the reader a complete view of how normal Boba was (it could've been any one of us), but still how different he was.
Thanks, all. One or two others have suggested that I should have said some more about Boba. I would like to, and plan to at some point, though I'm not sure this was the place to do it. I didn't want to make this essay longer.
The last sentence -- actually that only replicates what I felt as I looked at that plate, reading the real name of Abhimanyu who had died, and the assumed name of the officer standing with me. There was something unreal and tragic there.
Well writen Dilip. That last line is some punch. Brings home the point. And the name 'Boba' reminds me of 'Bubba' from the movie Forrest Gump.
I did live in the Valley till 94 when I completed my schooling. I've since then finished college and emigrated abroad thanks to the blessings of God. My family and I were fortunate to have lived without harm through the years of 90 to 94 and that is thankfully because of the army's presence. I know for a fact that people including I, do not like being at gunpoint everyday while going across the streets and I do know that some of the soliders are less than polite. But from their point of view I do understand that while they're guarding our lives with theirs, they are still in danger from the same anonymous masses. No one knows where the next bomb is going to explode. It does get on everyone's nerves and everybody's on hair trigger.
Not many people realize this anyway. I have had excellent experiences as well as bad ones with our army people. But, on any given day, I bow to the courage of the jawans and officers who guard the frontiers against the fuckin' terrorists and Paki slime.
I for one, truly believe that peace between India and Paki's is not possible. They are deceitful people and what we need are politicians from south India without the emotional baggage of unified India or separation at partition.
How do you decide whether someone looks like a terrorist or not??? Isn't calling the army jawans goondas is easy but just place yourself in their shoes and try imagining the situation with your colleagues getting killed every now and then by people who do not, unlike in movies, sport a huge beard always.
Goyal, thanks for your comment. My only response is that it's for the very reasons you mention that I wrote this article. To make the point that what's happening in Kashmir is not black and white. The Army guys have a hellish job; the ordinary Kashmiri is sick of violence and just wants peace and a normal life back. I wrote this to try to provoke thought in the rest of us about what's happening in Kashmir. Do we need to think about it some more, in some different ways?
Hey Dilip, I was browsing in b/w work and came across this from Amit Varma's blog. I have to say, I missed a few hrs of work but enjoyed every bit of it. And very nice essay, this one (I have read it before).
Dont ever think of taking out the anon posting, those guys will never bother to get a user ID and post.
on another, these comments left by "anonymous" are extremely entertaining, your replies even more so.
It's true, perhaps I did end abruptly. I have it at the back of my mind to take this forward, to write some more about this man Sikka. I need to find a way to do that.
I had read this story in the Outlook Booklet that it was published in.(The one that mentions you as earning your 'dal-fry' :))

Militaries are inherently trained to see in black and white.Anything grey is suspect and enemy. Its the enemy that motivates them like the fist of the captain indicated. At the end of the day everything goes down into the regimental histories and War Diaries and ends there. Soldiers are taught to just pass by the fallen comrades and keep moving. In assault there are no pauses.
But mush must also be shared by the governments for setting policies and interests that do not win hearts and mind. Democracy is all about sociology.

Here, I am reminded of my friend and course mate, Major James Thomas, AC (P) who laid down his life whilst saving other two. That's why when a soldier gives his message, to the messenger going home, says "When you go home ~ Tell them of us and say ~ For your tomorrow ~ We gave our today".
The wastewater from an industrial site can take on many different characteristics, and create many different problems from both an environmental as well as a cost standpoint. D & D Engineering works closely with the chemical/process environmental design engineers to integrate the best electrical system for the needs of the wastewater train. This includes storage elements and control of level and flow, treatment elements including flow and chemical treatment, and discharge elements including flow monitoring and control. All of these elements are required to keep the wastewater process in compliance with the state and federal discharge limits imposed on each facility. Choice of the correct piece of instrumentation from both a functional standpoint as well as a materials-of-construction standpoint can make the difference in a successful control strategy or an operational/maintenance nightmare. The staff of D & D Engineering has, as one of their primary design criteria, the process train environment to insure that their design provides dependability and longevity of service.

Kiwako Flügel Makina (蒔名フリューゲル季和子, Makina Furyūgeru Kiwako) [1] is the former chief guard at Deadman Wonderland. She had the entire prison under her command, with the exception of G Ward. After she discovered Tamaki's secrets about the Wretched Egg, the Deadmen and the Forgeries, she turned against him and shut the prison down. Later, she set out on a mission to defeat Hagire Rinichirō and seal the Wretched Egg.
Sometime before the storyline, Makina joined the Special Forces, where she learned her swordsmanship skills. There, she also befriended Ekō Kaidō, Kashima Toraichi and Bonbu. At some point, she became a warden at Deadman Wonderland. Four years before the start of the series, Makina ordered that the Necro Macro be used to hunt down and capture a rampaging Kiyomasa Senji within the prison.
Makina is a young, attractive woman. She has noticeably large breasts (G-cupped, as she stated) with long, dark-brown hair that is usually kept in her prison-hat, with one lock of hair hanging right of her face. She has dark-blue eyes and she sports glossy nude pink lipstick. On duty, she wears her prison-uniform, that is dark-blue, with a matching hat. Her pants are white and she has black knee-length boots that are high-heeled.
Makina is a harsh, stone-cold enforcer, who doesn't hesitate to punish, often brutally, the prison population. She uses her sword to cut whoever breaks the prison's rules.
Despite Makina's brutality, she is far less twisted than Tsunenaga Tamaki, whom she is was greatly suspicious of before finding out the truth regarding Deadman Wonderland. Makina is honest when answering questions concerning herself, as she casually told a prisoner her breast size when he asked in a lecherous manner and also mentioned her diet to her subordinate, Kasuga Kyōko, during an important situation. Makina also has a habit of giving things odd or silly names.
Makina has an odd sense of justice. She is willing to commit crimes to solve greater ones. Makina also isn't above blackmailing even government officials to achieve things her goals. She cares for her friends and those she calls comrades.
She is first seen welcoming the prisoners to Deadman Wonderland, including Ganta. She introduces herself as the chief warden. She then explains that Deadman Wonderland is a special prison. She explains the full publicity and the touristic function of the prison. She asks if there are any questions and a prisoner asks what her bra-size is. She replies that it's a G. She was just about to talk about the prisoners' necklaces, when Yō Takami bumped into Ganta and stole his candy. Makina sees this and tells Yō that she'll overlook it if he gave the candy back. Yō pretends that he doesn't know what she is talking about and Makina says that he'll receive an appropriate punishment, and slashes him across the chest. While Kasuga tends to Yō's wound, Ganta yells that Makina is insane. Makina responds by stepping on Yō's head and telling Ganta that, insane or not, reality is made to be unfair and unjust. She concludes by saying that he and the other prisoners have no chance of escaping their reality - Deadman Wonderland.
She is next seen in Tamaki Tsunenaga's room, with him asking her if she did went a little overboard. Afterwards, she is seen explaining the functionality of the poison within the collar, as a prisoner goes insane. She explains that the prisoner does not have much time left to live, as the poison will kill him soon.
Makina, suspecting Ganta Igarashi to be somehow involved in the Red Man's attack in a Deadman Wonderland courtyard, sends out the Necro Macro to hunt him down. She later gets angry when Ganta and the Necro Macro go off the grid, causing her to believe there's an area of Deadman Wonderland that was hidden from her jurisdiction. After her men find no trace of the prisoners and the Necro Macro, she heads off to confront Tamaki on the matter. Outside of Tamaki's office, Makina runs into Chan and En who tell her that he is not currently accepting visitors. Makina states that she'll be quick and walks forward, Chan and En place their blades to her neck, telling her that that would be most ill-considered. Makina heeds their warning and leaves, angrily. When Makina returns, she discusses the recent tremor and the Red Hole incident with them.
Makina and Kasuga illegally sneak into Tamaki's office when he's preoccupied with entertaining Major Aohi. They come across his list of "potentials" and are interrupted midway, forcing the two of them to hide within a stuffed chicken. Makina laters questions Tamaki and tells him that Ganta and Yō will be thoroughly questioned regarding their whereabouts over the last eleven days.
After a short time skip, Makina is seen alongside Kashima, Kasuga and Bonbu training a group of soldiers.
Sword: Makina's sword is a basic katana that is decorated. She has ample skill in the wielding the blade.
Worm Eater sword: When Karako Koshio smuggled some Undertaker weapons outside Deadman Wonderland, she handed them over to Ekō Kaidō and he brought them to a university lab. The lab investigated the Worm Eater and later had them embedded within this blade. When Makina invited Ekō and his companions to Deadman Wonderland, he delivered the sword to Makina. She wielded the blade during her battle with the Forgeries.

Watch Discovery Channel: Animals are everywhere in this world! Also on the rooftop where your solar panels wait – as a bait. Because some rats, martens and the whole weasel family like the rubber in the wires.
Another reason to have an inspection at least once per year is to find out about possibly unwelcome visitors. But look carefully! Mice like to hide in cable ducts and chew the insulation off the coper wires.
Birds build their nests in nooks and crannies under the solar panels. Martens also like to bring up their hide away their broods where they will not be disturbed – underneath the solar panels. There are areas, where pests like these are making quite a lot of trouble for operators of solar installations. If such cases get out of hand, you will need to secure the installations using wire mesh or more sturdy sheet metal.
In some case there were crows observed which threw nuts and fruits from high altitude on the modules in order to crack them. Therefore glass-glass-modules provide the best stability against this folk – from both sides of the panel.

Here are universal rules players should follow to enjoy discovering and exploring more in the story:
That off-hand remark by a random person on the street, a recurring nightmare, that random object you happened to stray upon… Very few things in an RPG are meaningless.
Storytellers give you hooks designed to lead you to something important that helps in figuring out the obstacle at hand. Don’t make the mistake of thinking we won’t hand out red herrings or dead ends because we respect your intelligence (we’re here to have fun, too), but do pay attention, keep thinking, and be observant.
There’s nothing more frustrating to a ST than to lay out a trail of clues and have no characters with the intelligence and courage to follow it.
Don’t avoid following clues just because they lead to a “scary place.” Role-playing your character’s disinterest in following the clues is one thing, but don’t let your personal fears of getting your character stuck in a sticky situation get in the way of the story.
If you find yourself bored and uninvolved in the story, it’s probably time for you to suck up your insecurities and make a move (or leave the game). You are responsible for your involvement on the site; if you want to be doing something, don’t wait for an ST to initiate.
Don’t be afraid to try new and not-entirely logical things. Even misguided creativity is rewarding. Here are some basic problem-solving ideas:
Talk to Non-player Characters (NPCs). There’s a lot of information out there that players discover by simply asking – if you can find the right people and ask the right questions.
Check out the background. Talk to people who knew the victim or the big baddie, like family or teachers or allies. Pull out all the records you can get. Basically, do your research. Forewarned is forearmed.
Check out the Setting. STs may not be specific about the setting of a scene, but the information is there for the asking. Don’t be afraid to contact an ST to ask questions, even if the information seems silly or irrelevant.
Work as a Team. Two heads are better than one, right? Be smart about partnering up. Other players can be just as good a resource as anything the STs provide.
There is nothing the STs like more than to have their nefarious schemes spoiled. We’re glad to see characters figuring things out and giving back the same level of challenge that we dish up.
How to Create Believable Characters is your critical guide to learn the near-magic trick that breathes life into your character, the crucial tips to create believable personality and the pro writer advice on how to craft characters readers fall in love with.

No known air checks exist of Sandy Jackson, the original Storz disc jockey during the time he was at KOWH. This brief clip, which includes his well known PAMS theme song was recently discovered. It is believed this was recorded in 1957.
Contrary to popular belief, KOWH was not originally a Top 40 station under Storz ownership, which began in 1949. Sandy played a variety of popular and other music, as well as taking requests and making dedications. Regardless of the exact format, the station played popular music and had huge ratings, perhaps the highest in the nation at that time. The "Top 40" format was introduced in 1954 on Storz Station WTIX, and within weeks on WHB. Whether the actual Storz "Top 40" format was ever placed on KOWH, and if so, when, is not entirely clear.

You don't want to miss a episode once this case study starts. I'm going to be sharing massive tips and advice to help you better understand how to make money with Amazon. Plus, you will see me actually doing the things I share in my own business. As well as the end result.
﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Everything I have learned so far about Amazon and that I am doing to build a profitable AMZ store is largely contributed to this free training webinar where you will learn exactly what I am doing, how I am doing it and what tools I am using to set up this entire Amazon business.
The business model that I am using is known as “Retail Arbitrage”. Retail Arbitrage is when you find a product being sold in a store at one price, buy that item and then resale it for a higher price somewhere else.Retail arbitrage is a multi-billion dollar industry and can be done with virtually any service, or product. In this particular instance we are talking about physical products being listed for profit on Amazon
Before I get to deep into this episode I just want to clarify one thing that I know is going to come up.
﻿Recently Amazon has cracked ﻿down ﻿on 3rd party sellers on their platform. After having an extensive conversation with an ﻿﻿﻿Amazon ﻿﻿﻿customer service rep (I like to get my info straight from the “horse’s mouth”)…Amazon does not mind 3rd party sellers as long as they can keep up with demand and have great customer service.﻿
Especially since almost half of Amazon’s revenue comes from 3rd party sellers. Which I explain in the video above.
Bottom line is you are an experienced Amazon seller and you don’t feel comfortable with the business model I am showing, you don’t have to use this same model for yourself. Throughout this case study I am showing what is and has been working for ME so far.
As I mentioned before throughout this process I am not spending money on marketing because Amazon already spends over 1.23 BILLION DOLLARS in marketing and retargeting there products.
So I’m not even going to try to compete with that at this stage of my business. I would much rather build this 6-7 figure business just feeding off of the traffic they are already bringing in.
I would not worry if you are not making a lot throughout this time. The fact is with this particular model (sense we aren’t spending any money on traffic) you may or may not make a killing.
There is way to say how much money you will make in this time period. It depends on many factors like how fast you start building your store with profitable products and how many of the products you have.
Without getting to deep the buy box is where most of the sales on Amazon come from, about 86% to be specific. Chances are if you have done any shopping on Amazon at all, most of the items you have bought have been through the buy box.
As an Amazon Seller getting the “Buy Box” should be one of your top 2 objectives. (The first for me is having great customer service)
The good news is the “Buy Box” does not stick with one seller. It rotates through the top 3-5 sellers of a product, but there are a lot of variables that will determine whether or not you will be one of those sellers.
1. You have to be a professional seller for more than 90 Days. (This is the paid amazon seller account)
This isn’t all of the factors that can affect whether you get the buy box or now, and only Amazon knows the exact formula that they use to determine who gets the buy box and for how long.
Keep in mind just because you don’t have the buy box does not mean you won’t make sales, but it definitely helps…ALOT
· We opened our store July 7th , I was able to make this even with medical appointments, and recovery from surgery ( I was down for about 4 weeks) so technically I have only been actively running this business for about 3 weeks
Honestly, that last point is the overall reason why I like this business model so much. The fact that all we have to do is list high quality items one time and it can sell over and over again until the day we take them down is awesome. Spend 10 min listing an item and sell it potentially hundreds of times…I can dig it.
· My cancellation rate is at 14.29% which I am working on improving right now. This is mainly because I wasn’t staying on top of my inventory like I was supposed to be doing. Since then I got set up with an inventory management software the eliminated this problem.
(I know what you are thinking. Oh wait DeAnte I thought you said you don’t have inventory with this business model? We don’t but you still have to make sure that items you are listing on Amazon are in stock at the supplier you will buy it from when it sales)
When you check out this free webinar training you will see which software I use to manage all of this for me automatically.
· My late shipment rate is 14.29% because I set my shipment rate in Amazon to low. I think it was set at 2-3 days so I just increased it to 4-6 days. As my daughter would say "Easy Peasy"..lol
· My valid tracking rate is at 14.29%. I was inputting my tracking numbers and not clicking the right shipping company. So I decided to pay closer attention to this when I am confirming my shipments. Another easy fix.
This is how my Amazon business is going so far peeps. I hope you enjoyed this episode. Leave a comment below if you have any questions or just to let me know if you are digging this case study so far.

The ever-so-lovely Kate, from The Goodie Life, invited me to participate in her fun and eye opening series, "What's on your nightstand?" As you might suspect by the title, it involves bloggers sharing a peek of their bedside tables and the contents thereof. Pretty racy stuff, huh. ;0) Well I was so flattered that she would ask, that I promptly got out the duster and set to work. I'd love it if you would stop by and visit and tell me what you think. See mine here.
And Kate, thanks so much for inviting me to play along! Oh, and while you're there, be sure to check out the previous participants. Even Apartment Therapy got in on the act!
Nelya, you creative soul you! How wonderful that the photos of your boys are the last things you see before you turn off the light.
Would you want the truth (a haphazard pile of four magazines and three books, a clock, and two pairs of earplugs) or the stylized version (artfully-arranged reading material, a still-to-be ordered sexy clock from MoMA, the mystery perfect lamp I have yet to find, and an Amazon lily in an "important" bud vase?
Ticklish and Raina: This is the stylized version. Come by on a regular day and the entire house is pure, unadulterated chaos. ;0)
I'm so impressed with you! Your nightstand is fabulous. Besides your precious boys, I especially love that lamp. My nightstand is a horror show. Stacks of books, several pairs of reading glasses, a water bottle, and a huge jar of ginger-scented hand cream.
Great! First time here and love these types of insider voyeuristic posts! Will check it out...judging by your blog, sure its lovely!
Completely, totally, madly head over heels smitten with my three boys and my one-and-only. This is a spot where I can corral the numerous images and thoughts and delightful finds that come my way. If you find joy or inspiration here as well, all the better. Thanks for stopping by. -Nelya

Details: Sarasota Opera is pleased to invite composers to submit works for a new opera for possible production in November 2017 by Sarasota Youth Opera, one of the most comprehensive programs in the United States.
This invitation is open to any living composer or librettist, of any age, who is a United States citizen.
Since 1984, Sarasota Youth Opera (SYO) has given young people age 8 to 18 an opportunity to experience the magic of opera through participation in after-school choruses, Sarasota Opera mainstage productions, summer workshops, and the Youth Opera's own full-scale productions.
Regarded as a leader in the commissioning and producing of works for young voices, SYO is the only program in the United States committed to presenting annual, full-scale opera productions for young voices with professional musicians, direction, and costume and scenic design.
Since 1986, five commissioned world premieres and over 20 additional youth opera productions have been presented. Past commissions include:
Our most recent commission, Little Nemo in Slumberland, featured over 106 young people and used a ground-breaking projection technology called SCRIBE (Self-Contained Rapidly Integratable Background Environment) to bring Winsor McCay�s comic strips to life. Since it�s 2012 premiere, Little Nemo in Slumberland has been performed by The University of Kentucky Opera Theatre, Tulsa Youth Opera, La Sierra University, and Pittsburgh High School for the Performing Arts.
In November 2014, SYO presented Dean Burry�s The Hobbit. Based on the writings of J.R.R. Tolkien, this classic adventure was brought to life with a cast of over 95 young people and 12 professional musicians on the stage of the Sarasota Opera House.
"Sarasota Opera is dedicated to performing classic works of opera in a manner that is true to the composer�s intentions. In the years that we have been doing productions with our Youth Opera, I have found there are few works of substantial musical value for young people to perform. In our desire to increase the repertoire we are looking for music that is rooted in the classic music style, reflecting how that music is written today without the influence of other genres such musical theater, jazz or other popular idioms.

Valentine’s Day or Single Awareness Day is an excuse to do something different and enjoyable. Express your affection by making your own gifts this Valentine’s Day. We are featuring today three lovely easy-to-make and very tasty gift ideas to show appreciation to your love one, friends and family!
Make your Valentine’s Day perfect with our 3 most romantic and sweetest Valentine’s Day recipes we cherry picked for you.
Over medium-low heat, combine 2 cups sugar with honey and 1 cup water in a saucepan. When sugar melts, add mint leaves and let simmer, stirring occasionally, about 30 minutes. Strain and return liquid to saucepan. Remove from heat. Stir in fresh lime juice, crushed rosebuds and rose water. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or up to a week.
Thin, flat flower heads, such as violas, violets and chamomile, are ideal. Marigold and rose heads are bulky and contain too much moisture, and will cause the hard candy to “weep.” Consider using their petals instead.
Be sure to use organically grown flowers. Eat only those flowers you are positive you can identify. Use pesticide-free plants from nurseries and herb gardens that offer organically grown flowers; pick them from a trusted friend’s organic garden or your own.
Hard Candy Notes: It’s a good idea to check the accuracy of your candy thermometer before you begin. You can do this by placing it in a saucepan of water and bringing the water to a boil. At boiling, the thermometer should read 212° F; if the reading is higher or lower, take the difference into account when testing the temperature of your candy mixture.
Your candy can take on a burned flavor if it is heated beyond the hard crack stage 310°F. You can remove the liquid candy from the heat once your thermometer registers 300°F. Allow the temperature to rise on its own for the last 10 degrees.
Step 1: Cover a heat-proof work surface with parchment paper. Two or more metal baking sheets can also be used.
Step 3: Bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Continue to heat without stirring until the bubbling mixture reaches the hard-crack stage (302-310°F). This will take approximately 25 minutes. Remove pan from heat.
Step 4: Stir in flavoring oils and one or two drops of food coloring. (Be extra careful because the mixture will steam with these additions.) Stir well. As you stir, the mixture will develop small bubbles.
Step 5: When most of the bubbles have disappeared, drop the liquid candy onto the parchment paper by the spoonful using a metal spoon. Allow the candy to stand for a few moments before placing the petal or mint leaf (or combination of the two) on the hot candy. If you place the petal on the hot candy too soon, it will wilt immediately.
Step 6: Place a petal or mint leaf face down on the candy round. Use a finger (carefully!) or the end of a lollipop stick to slightly press it into the candy. Pour just enough hot candy over the petal to cover the back side, encasing it completely in the candy. Place a lollipop stick in the candy and rotate 1/2 turn. Allow the candy to harden and then lift from the parchment paper. If the lollipop appears cloudy, you may quickly and gently rinse it under a thin stream of warm water.
Step 7: Wrap lollipops in clear cellophane and tie-off with a ribbon or twist-tie. Display lollipops in sugar-filled glasses or jars. You can also use flower pots with Styrofoam inserts. lollipops to air-dry overnight before packaging.
Gift as a candy bouquet or individually, either way this is a great way to make homemade treats for everyone you care about, and it’s quite inexpensive too!

Like many things in life, the importance of something is never truly appreciated until it is gone. If you’ve lost your teeth, whether due to injury, tooth decay or gum disease, you surely understand. The good news is that you have options to replace them. Dentures can help restore your way of life by helping you with day-to-day functions, such as eating and speaking, as well as help restore your confidence by improving your appearance and smile.
Making a denture is a process that usually takes about 6-12 weeks, however this can vary from one patient to another.
It also depends on the type of the denture and the technique the dentist or the laboratory technician uses to make the denture.
Complete dentures are made using your mouth as a model. First, the dentist will take an accurate impression of the upper and lower arches of your mouth. This impression is then sent to the dental laboratory.
At the next visit, the dentist will record the relationship of the arches that best resembles your original bite and helps you select the shape and color of the denture teeth and gums. Keep in mind the color of everyone’s gums varies. To make a more natural denture the dentist will help you choose the shade that best matches your mouth.
In the subsequent visits the dentist will adjust your bite, test your speech and check the appearance and functionality of the denture teeth and gums. After a satisfactory fit and appearance is achieved, the denture is then sent back to the laboratory for fabrication.
While every effort is made to make a good and functional denture, please keep in mind that there is no such thing as a perfect denture. After delivery of the denture, it may require a few adjustment visits and some time for you and your new denture to adapt to each other. The most important point to remember is that adjusting to your new dentures is a process; it sometimes takes a little time to get used to.
A new denture can also alter your eating and speaking habits and it may require a bit of practicing before you get comfortable.
Finally, due to differences in the shapes of the jaws and the strong muscle movement of the tongue and cheek, a lower denture may be harder to keep in the mouth compared to an upper denture.
There are new advances in making dentures. One such advance is an implant-supported denture that stabilizes the denture. This kind of denture requires the placement of implants in your mouth before making the denture.
If you’ve suffered severe tooth decay, injury, or gum disease and need your remaining teeth replaced, an immediate denture can help relieve you of some concerns you may have after the extraction process is complete. An immediate denture, as its name implies, is a denture that is placed in your mouth immediately after your teeth are removed. It makes the transition to dentures less noticeable and also helps keep you performing everyday functions, like chewing and speaking.
Immediate dentures are made using your mouth as a model. First, the dentist will take an accurate impression of the upper and lower arches of your mouth and establish a bite that best resembles your original bite. The dentist will also help you select the shape and color of the denture teeth and gums. This impression is then sent to the dental laboratory.
During the next visit the dentist will adjust your bite, test your speech and check the appearance and functionality of the denture teeth and gums. Sometimes it is necessary to repeat this step to ensure that everything is just right.
After a satisfactory fit and appearance are achieved, the denture is then sent back to the laboratory for fabrication. At the subsequent visit, the remaining teeth will be removed and the denture will be delivered. Please note that the extractions may be performed at one visit or they may be removed in two or more visits depending on the number and condition of the teeth to be extracted, the shape of your jaws and your health condition. The dentist will best advise you of the preferred timing for your extractions.
While every effort is made to make a good and functional denture, please keep in mind that there is no such a thing as a perfect denture. After delivery of the immediate denture, it may require a few adjustment visits and some time for you and your immediate denture to adapt to each other. This is due to the fact that when your gums heal following the extractions they will shrink for a period of about 6 months and the denture needs to be re-based or re-lined to fit properly.
The most important point to remember is that adjusting to your immediate dentures is a process; in some cases, it takes weeks or months to get used to your immediate denture.
An immediate denture can also alter your eating; you will not have the same chewing efficiency as you had with your natural teeth. An immediate denture will also alter your speaking and it may require a bit of practicing before you get comfortable. Keep in mind that due to differences in the shapes of the jaws and the strong muscle movements of the tongue and cheek, a lower denture may be harder to keep in the mouth compared to an upper denture.
Fortunately there are new alternatives now, such as implants, which can help restore functionality that is more like natural teeth. You can discuss this possibility with the dentist.
Partial dentures are replacement teeth for people who have lost one or more of their teeth. Partial dentures can be taken in and out of the mouth and consist of a denture base, which closely resembles the color of your gums and denture teeth, which are attached to a supporting framework. The partial denture then attaches to the existing teeth via a clasp or some other retentive device.
Making a partial denture requires about 6-8 weeks, however this can vary from one patient to another. It also could depend on the type of denture and the technique your dentist or the laboratory technician uses.
The first step in making a partial denture is the preparation of the teeth. During this phase your dentist may prepare the teeth that the partial denture will use for support. Next, your dentist will take an accurate impression of the upper and lower arches of your mouth and records your bite. The impressions are then sent to the dental laboratory.
At the subsequent visits your dentist will evaluate your bite, test your speech and check the appearance and function of the partial denture teeth and gums.
After the final satisfactory fit and appearance are achieved, the denture is then sent back to the laboratory for final fabrication.
While every effort is made to make a good and functional partial denture, it may require a few adjustment visits and a little time for you and your partial denture to adapt to each other. The most important point to remember is that adjusting to your partial denture is a process; in some cases, it takes weeks to get used to a partial denture.
A new partial denture can also alter your eating and speaking habits and it may require a bit of practicing before you get comfortable.
There are newly developed techniques in making partial dentures. One such advance is an implant-supporting partial denture that helps give additional support to the partial denture. While it offers additional support it also requires the placement of implants in your mouth before making the denture.
There is also a partial denture that uses a special material called valplast which is more aesthetically pleasing to the eye. This kind of partial does not use metal as its base and has hooks that are made with a flexible plastic material.
If you are scheduled to have a tooth pulled before getting your partial denture, then your dentist may advise you to get a temporary partial denture or a stayplate while your gums and their supporting bone are healing. A stayplate will replace the missing tooth or teeth and can help you with your chewing and speaking until a more permanent solution is achieved. A stayplate will also help maintain your appearance when in public and keep your existing teeth from shifting in your mouth and creating bigger problems.
Stayplates are made using your mouth as a model. First, your dentist will take an accurate impression of the upper and lower arches of your mouth and establish a bite that best resembles your original bite. Your dentist will also help you select the shape and color of the stayplate teeth and gums. This impression is then sent to the dental laboratory.
Please keep in mind that there is no such a thing as a perfect stayplate. After delivery, it may require a few adjustment visits and some time for you and your stayplate to adapt to each other.
Stayplates can also alter your eating; you will not have the same chewing efficiency as you had with your natural teeth. Stayplate will also alter your speaking and it may require a bit of practicing before you get comfortable.
The most important point to remember is that adjusting to your stayplate is a process and stayplate is a temporary replacement until another form of treatment such as an implant, bridge or a partial denture can be made.

Popular pubs and restaurants could disappear from the high street as a result of a business rate rises in April, the Government is being warned.
A group of business leaders has written a letter to Chancellor Philip Hammond pushing him to reconsider the hike that could see some companies hit by a 42 per cent rise in rates.
Bosses at All Bar One, Wagamama, Pizza Express, Greene King, and Slug & Lettuce have asked that the Chancellor to curb the rise in next month’s budget, claiming it will add between £300-500m for the hospitality sector.
The joint letter, according to The Times, states: “Margins in our sector are already under intense pressure, due to the cumulative impact of increased wage, training and regulatory costs and there is a very real danger that these increases will result in a freeze in investment and a scaling back of new openings and job creation.
“We have already seen evidence of outlets closing as a result of the planned increase. Modern pubs, bars and restaurants are valuable social, economic and community assets— they contribute to our thriving tourism sector, high street regeneration and attract and support significant inward investment.
“As such, they are well placed to capitalise on the opportunities presented by Brexit, but they will not be able to do so if hampered by unsustainable additional costs.”
The new rates, which will come into force from April, will see potential a cost in bills rise 12.5 per cent to 42 per cent.
A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: “The great British pub is a national asset, providing thousands of jobs and boosting the economy by £21 billion a year. The method of valuing pubs was agreed by the five major trade bodies and has not changed.
“Following the revaluation, three quarters of properties will see no change or even a fall in their bills, and the small minority of businesses that face an increase will benefit from our £3.6 billion transitional relief scheme.”

I now spend my time indulging my passion for making things. I paint, carve, make lovespoons, draw and make beaded jewellery .
My pictures often spill out over the mount as a regular rectangular or square shaped mount or frame is too restricting.
I have also been incorporating threads and beads into images painted with acrylic paints on canvas, as well as into my images printed on to cotton or silk.
I have always been fascinated by the sea and as I now live in Southerndown within sight and sound of the coast, I am concentrating on exploring the ever-changing colours, moods and patterns in my paintings , prints and jewellery to try to communicate my feelings and emotions connected with the ocean.

What do you think about the death penalty? Or punishment in general? Have you ever read Discipline & Punish? I can’t stop.
I’m against the death penalty, as no government “of the people” deserves the right to take a life any more than an individual person does. As far as punishment in general, our criminal justice system is a punitive and grotesque method of social control that is the single greatest obstacle to our freedom. Too often, those involved in our legal system confuse their duty to protect the people with the authority to punish them.

BPHSCA Sci-Quest performers set 4-peat victories at NSQ | Department of Education, Region IV | Calabarzon
‘Being consistent champion at National Science Quest for 4 consecutive years is an achievement to be proud of. TUGSAYAWIT, JINGLE –MAKING and SCI- FOLK DANCE that require exceptional skill in body movements and in musical composition were the edge of our young artists in every competition,’ school principal Dulce Amor M. Abante exclaimed referring to the recent success of Batangas Province High School for Culture and Arts’s performing artists at the National Sci-Quest held in Baguio City on February 5-7,2016.
NSQ has invited schools all over the country to be part of its advocacy of enhancing and promoting Science through competitions that focuses on the importance of science in daily living is the main objective.
‘Too much effort is needed to make every aspect near to perfection; from lyrics, original musical composition, motif, choreography, costumes, etc. and the expenses! Anyway, God will provide and thanks God, hindi kami nabigo,” expressed with a sigh of relief by Mrs Abante.
From 2013, BPHSCA has been the representative of Batangas Province to the Regional Level where all the entries qualified to compete and represent the region in the National level.
BPHSCA’s Tugsayawit and Jingle were declared Champion at NSQ 2013, 2014 and 2016 in Baguio City and NSQ 2015 in Pasig City.
Prior to the contest, the creative team composed of specialists/teachers from 5 specializations did the brainstorming that eventually ended up to a sound conclusion. ‘Proper scheduling of classes and rehearsals is also important to make sure that the academics are not left behind and the good thing for this is the open-mindedness and being understanding of subject teachers who helped a lot to the team,’ she added.
Before NSQ’s Tugsayawit, the school participated and won in the same category like the SAYAWIT conducted by Edukasyon sa Pagpapahalaga. The school was declared champion in the Division and Regional levels and 1st runner up in the Nationals held in Baguio.

Posted wait times reflect the approximate time to see a physician at each ECHN campus. Wait times change frequently as conditions change. Patients with the most serious illnesses/injuries are given priority, so your wait time may be longer. Wait times may be affected by the number of patients in the emergency department and severity of their conditions. Wait time postings are for general public information only and are not a commitment to serve any patient within any time period.
Hospital emergency departments treat patients with the most serious conditions first, so patients with less urgent needs will often wait longer to see a doctor.
ECHN offers Urgent Care Services in South Windsor for treatment of non-emergency conditions where patients are seen on a first come, first served, walk-in basis.

PARIS - Salty water just below the surface of Mars could hold enough oxygen to support the kind of microbial life that emerged and flourished on Earth billions of years ago, researchers reported Monday (Oct 22).
In some locations, the amount of oxygen available could even keep alive a primitive, multicellular animal such as a sponge, they reported in the journal Nature Geosciences.
"We discovered that brines" - water with high concentrations of salt - "on Mars can contain enough oxygen for microbes to breathe," said lead author Vlada Stamenkovic, a theoretical physicist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California.
"This fully revolutionises our understanding of the potential for life on Mars, today and in the past," he told AFP.
Up to now, it had been assumed that the trace amounts of oxygen on Mars were insufficient to sustain even microbial life.
"We never thought that oxygen could play a role for life on Mars due to its rarity in the atmosphere, about 0.14 per cent," Stamenkovic said.
On Earth, aerobic - that is, oxygen breathing - life forms evolved together with photosynthesis, which converts CO2 into O2. The gas played a critical role in the emergence of complex life, notable after the so-called Great Oxygenation Event some 2.35 billion years ago.
But our planet also harbours microbes - at the bottom of the ocean, in boiling hot springs - that subsist in environments deprived of oxygen.
"That's why - whenever we thought of life on Mars - we studied the potential for anaerobic life," Stamenkovic.
The new study began with the discovery by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover of manganese oxides, which are chemical compounds that can only be produced with a lot of oxygen.
Curiosity, along with Mars orbiters, also established the presence of brine deposits, with notable variations in the elements they contained.
A high salt content allows for water to remain liquid - a necessary condition for oxygen to be dissolved - at much lower temperatures, making brines a happy place for microbes.
Depending on the region, season and time of day, temperatures on the Red Planet can vary between minus 195 and 20 deg C.
The researchers devised a first model to describe how oxygen dissolves in salty water at temperatures below freezing.
A second model estimated climate changes on Mars over the last 20 million years, and over the next 10 million years.
Taken together, the calculations showed which regions on the Red Planet are most likely to produce brine-based oxygen, data that could help determine the placement of future probes.
"Oxygen concentrations (on Mars) are orders of magnitude" - several hundred times - "greater than needed by aerobic, or oxygen-breathing - microbes," the study concluded.
"Our results do not imply that there is life on Mars," Stamenkovic cautioned. "But they show that the Martian habitability is affected by the potential of dissolved oxygen."

From February 6 through May 13, the exhibition "Lines of Inquiry: Learning from Rembrandt's Etchings" will be on view at Allen Memorial Art Museum in Oberlin, OH. The exhibition has been organized in collaboration with the Johnson Museum of Art in Ithaca, NY.
Rembrandt’s etchings, long treasured for their innovation and perceptive portrayal of the human psyche, continue to inspire a wide range of audiences and admirers, including scientists and engineers. Encouraging close looking at these masterworks in the context of collection building and new scientific approaches, this multifaceted exhibition will highlight Rembrandt’s scope and subtlety as an etcher.
More than sixty impressions from across Rembrandt’s oeuvre will show the artist’s process, including how he made changes to his plates, and detail his use of a variety of printing supports. Works from the collections of Cornell, Harvard, Princeton, Syracuse, and Yale Universities, Oberlin and Vassar Colleges, the University of Kansas, the Morgan Library & Museum, and private collections will feature subject matter ranging from portraits and self-portraits to genre scenes, religious narratives, landscapes, study plates, and academic nude studies.
The accompanying catalogue incorporates new research and initiatives that examine the status of the printmaker, including an overview of Rembrandt print collecting by American academic collections, an account of Oberlin’s secret guardianship of the Morgan’s Rembrandt prints during World War II, and an introduction to Cornell’s Watermark Identification in Rembrandt’s Etchings (WIRE) project, a collaboration among museums, faculty, and students dedicated to digitally facilitating access to Rembrandt watermark scholarship.
Andaleeb Badiee Banta, exhibition curator of Lines of Inquiry: Learning from Rembrandt’s Etchings, gives free, 45-minute tours on these two dates.

“Rembrandt: The Last Renaissance Artist” is the title of a guest lecture by Catherine Scallen, Andrew W. Mellon Associate Professor in the Humanities and Associate Professor of Art History at Case Western Reserve University. Rembrandt was a printmaker and painter of the 17th century, but his choice of subjects and thematic presentation allied him more with earlier Renaissance art. Scallen examines this retrospective side of Rembrandt’s art and offers possible motivations—centering on his personal ambition as an artist. The program will be followed by a reception; galleries remain open until 7:30 p.m.

Missing teeth is a problem that makes many people feel self-conscious. Whether you have missing teeth because of tooth decay, gum disease, or injuries, getting dental implants in Citrus Park is a permanent alternative that can boost your self-esteem and enhance your smile.
Dental implants are artificial replacement teeth. Although dentures, crowns, and bridges are options for filling the gaps that missing teeth leave, dental implants are a more long-term solution. If you have missing or damaged teeth, dental implant surgery can give you natural-looking teeth that feel and look like real teeth.
Dental implants generally have three sections. The implant part is a root or screw that the surgeon inserts under the gums or into the jawbone. The abutment is the fastener that holds the crown or artificial tooth in place. The crown is usually made of zirconium or porcelain. There are also different kinds of dental implants: endosteal implants are surgically inserted into the jawbone, and subperiosteal implants are metal frames that are attached to the jawbone under the gums.
The cost of dental implants is different for everyone, and several factors affect this. The biggest factor that affects how much your dental implants cost is how complicated your surgery is. The type of dental implants, endosteal or subperiosteal, also affect the difficulty of the surgery and the costs. The total cost will also rise if you require bone grafting or other reconstruction before the implants are inserted.
Another factor that affects how much dental implants cost is getting dental implants in Citrus Park. This is because the price for dental services varies by location. Other factors include the implant materials and brands used as well as the number of dental implants that you need.
Insurance companies generally consider the dental implants procedure in the elective category, so they don’t cover it if an alternative is available for a lower price. With dental implants becoming more popular, however, many companies are offering dental implants insurance policies.
The amount that your insurance carrier pays toward your procedure and the materials will determine your cost of dental implants with insurance. For example, some dental implants insurance plans only pay for the crowns and leave you to cover the remainder.
There are several steps in the dental implants procedure, but the specific steps that we take are based on the implant type and the health of your jawbone. For instance, damaged teeth must be removed before the procedure. Despite some slight differences in the process, the primary dental implants procedure steps include:
It takes months to complete the whole dental implants procedure. The process of dental implants can even take more than nine months depending on the number of steps involved and how long it takes you to recover from the jawbone prep and implant insertion. During the process, we manage dental implant procedure pain with pain relievers and anesthesia.
The main benefit of affordable dental implants is the solid support that they provide. Implants don’t attach to your real teeth or become loose. Other dental implants benefits include that they can:
Inflammation could develop in the gums and bones around your dental implants, so dental implant care after surgery is essential. This generally includes going to your dentist for follow-up appointments, during which the dentist will examine the hard and soft tissues and remove calcified buildup around your dental implants. Routine flossing and brushing are also essential to caring for dental implants.
You could be a dental implant candidate if you have damaged or missing teeth. Somebody who needs dental implants also has:
Contact our facility about getting dental implants in Citrus Park. Our staff can assist you in determining if dental implants are ideal for you.
Dental implants cost more than crowns, dentures, and bridges so many of our patients ask: “How long does a dental implant last?” It can last for years, typically 40 or more years, because it’s attached to or inserted into your jawbone. You can stretch out how long dental implants last by seeing your dental specialist on a regular basis, practicing good oral hygiene, and avoiding damaging habits such as using tobacco and eating hard foods.

This year the rates have changed for the 2011 FICA however the wage limits remained stable. This has caused a few people over on the MAS 90 LinkedIn group to question the correct procedure for printing W2 forms.
As you may be aware one of the hidden “gotcha’s” of the Payroll processing is that when you print W2 forms in Sage ERP MAS 90 or MAS 200 that the CURRENT FICA/Medicare limits are used to establish the maximum wages subject to each tax which prints on the W2 form.
Since tax tables are shared globally across all your Sage ERP MAS 90 and MAS 200 companies – simply copying the current company code to a backup isn’t enough. You also must be aware of what the tax limits are for at least FICA and Medicare because those limits can impact W2 printing for those exceeding them.
If the FICA or MEDICARE limits are changing in the next year — AND you install the tax tables BEFORE printing the last year’s W2 forms then you run the risk of the W2 form (for those exceeding FICA and/or Medicare) printing the maximum wage limit that’s included in your next year tax table instead of the limits for the year just passed.
Regina Gutcher, a Sage Customer Support Specialist, provided the following guidance on this LinkedIn discussion:
Keep in mind that FICA is not the only limit we need to be concerned about when printing W-2s. For some states, the limits for State Disability or State Unemployment may also need to be printed on the W-2.

Ok. I have been pretty quiet in the past couple of weeks. That's because I've been busy creating a set of baptismal invites of pretty little Georgine. I made 5 samples for Steph to choose from. And she asked me to merge two of my designs which is a bit challenging 'coz i first thought that it would look cluttered. So technically, i ended up designing another card that would include the elements she wanted. My client wanted the pink bib, the ribbon and flowers, and the dots background. And these are the results...
The base card was Pastelle Natural cardstock. I used Fiskars Dots embossing template on a pink Flamingo cardstock (well i actually requested it from my friend Janice coz she has the Dots template. Thank you dear!). The pink bib, gems, and the purple flower patch were from National Bookstore. The pink flowers i bought in Quiapo (i got this idea from my friend Jerosha. Thank you dear!). The ribbons are from SM Department Store with Janice's help again in sourcing supplies. The circle cardstock was also Pastelle Natural and the punched & petal-ed pink cardstock was Moods. I used my Coluzzle to make the petals on this round pink cardstock - this part is the hardest coz i had to cut each petal one by one! Plus, i had to punch each petal again one by one with my Crop-a-Dile (from my friend Claire. Thank you dear!). Isn't it nice to have creative friends that inspire you everyday of your life? ^_^
Another thing, I made an altered CD album for G. She's a great digital designer and has given me an altered CD case frame. So i thought, why don't i try to alter somethign too for her? Unfotunately i wasn't able to take snapshots of it. Maybe later when we have time in the office, i'll ask her to bring it so i can share the album with you. ^_^
One more thing, my sweet cousin Tom, asked me to make him a card for his 1st monthsery with his lovely Milleth. This is what i made for him. I really really love this card too. I stamped the white hearts with the CTMH stamps Claire gave me. The sentiment "LOVE" was from my Hero Arts Christmas stamp. Inside this card is a precious moment image that i colored with Faber Castell color pencils.
And the card below I made for my sweet boss coz it's her birthday today! ^_^ I wish to give her a handmade gift too but it's gonna be later next week coz i right now i need a little rest. I've been up til 3am ( I wake up at 5:45 coz i have to go to work) for 3 consecutive days to finish the baptismal invites. Plus i have to finish the handmade box that for Just together with her 42 Coffee Hugger orders. I'm actually excited to do this even when my body is dead tired.^_^
That's all for now. I wish everyone a magical weekend! coz for sure, I'll have one too. See, i'm going to the province to be with this little cutie. My sister told me that Tweeny and Patty are walking now! Yay! I can not wait to play with them!

Throughout history, people have demonized what they have failed to understand, and conduits are no exception. In the United States, conduits have been publically demonized and branded as “Bio-terrorists” by the Department of Unified Protection. Every individual with the Conduit Gene lives with the threat of indefinite detention.
Conduits are human beings that stand to make incredible contributions to medicine, technology, and artistic expression. They deserve dignity, freedom, and the opportunity to use their powers for the benefit of humanity.
In short, conduits are human beings who possess incredible powers. While these powers may seem supernatural, they actually stem from genetics. Every conduit possesses a gene that expresses a unique protein.
When this gene is exposed to ray field radiation, the conduit begins producing a protein that allows carriers to absorb, store, and manipulate specific ambient elements from their environment. These elements range from broad natural phenomena, like electricity, to very specific synthetic materials, like asphalt.
It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people carrying the Conduit Gene are merely “Conduit-Positive,” have the potential to change, but haven’t yet. Meaning they have no powers and are functionally no different than “normals,” or un-powered humans.
Conduit abilities vary wildly from individual to individual. All activated conduits can take an ambient element into their body. Most conduits can project the element that they have absorbed. Some can actually change the composition of their bodies to briefly adopt the physical properties of their element. Others can manipulate instances of that element in their environment. The factors that determine which element a conduit will control, or what they can do with said element, are unknown.
In addition to their elemental manipulation powers, conduits also exhibit extremely enhanced physical capabilities. They can endure and rapidly recover from injuries that would be fatal or crippling to a normal human. This enhanced healing also allows conduits to run, climb, and physically exert themselves nearly-indefinitely, without exhausting standard metabolic reserves of energy. Again, the specific cause of these abilities is unknown, but it represents truly staggering potential for medical science.
Like all humans, conduits have the capacity for violence. There is no evidence, however, that suggests the Conduit Gene has any affect whatsoever on a carrier’s personality. The assertions that all conduits are inherently violent, lacking in empathy, or mentally unstable, are baseless falsehoods stemming from public fear and misunderstanding of conduit abilities.
Again, it is crucial to point out that the majority of carriers are unactivated, meaning they have no special powers, and pose zero threat to their communities.
If we could reverse engineer conduit healing abilities into a form of treatment, it would change the landscape of medicine forever.
Medicine is merely the most obvious benefit. Even more impressive are the implications of their matter and energy manipulation powers. If we could capture the principles behind these abilities, we could revolutionize physics, chemistry, and manufacturing. A conduit’s abilities have utility in cost-effective third-world development and agricultural cultivation. There may even be applications for clean energy production and water purification.
Finally, there is a great deal to be said for possessing conduit powers. Having such abilities would open a whole new dimension of human experience, enhancing arts, entertainment and self-exploration. Imagine becoming like light itself, or moving objects with only the power of your mind. For the first time in history, truly magical experiences are within our grasp.
Ms. Pine partnered with educators, business owners, research scientists, and community leaders across the nation to create the CRL and help conduits receive the rights, recognition and simple dignity every human being deserves. The CRL strives to illuminate conduits’ unprecedented potential for good and to help mankind explore this exciting new chapter of humanity safely and happily.
Fighting for the civil rights of conduits who have been incarcerated by the Department of Unified Protection is the organization’s top priority. The CRL offers legal aid and financial support to the families of those who have been detained.

The Snohomish County Department of Emergency Management (SCDEM) manages the emergency response during disasters that overwhelm local resources.
The Emergency Operations Plan lays out the framework for the city’s organizational activities during disaster operations. Specifically, the plan provides guidance for mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery operations including disaster and emergency responsibilities and procedures, and training and community education activities. The plan also establishes a mutual understanding of authority, responsibilities and functions of local government and provides a basis for incorporating essential non-governmental agencies and organizations into the Emergency Management Organization.
SCDEM coordinates with cities to prepare their respective disaster response plans, to conduct training, and to carry out exercises to validate the plans. During disaster situations, SCDEM activates their Emergency Operations Center (EOC) at their headquarters office. The individual cities also operate their own EOCs, staffed by trained personnel, forming a local network for emergency response and resource allocation.
SCDEM and the city’s Emergency Operations Center work together in a coordinated effort to direct and control a jurisdiction-wide disaster response. Together, they assess threats to life and property, allocate fire, police and EMS resources, maintain communications, and keep the Washington State Emergency Management Division and surrounding jurisdictions informed of the local disaster situation.
Denver Housing Authority candles & incense ban & HUD smoking ban - 2017:June back to: Civic Satisfaction - face to face
Went to Denver Housing Authority’s (DHA) Regional Council Board (RCB) meeting, mostly to pass out the model petition, signature sheet, and instructions, to educate about my research and share. Talked so much during breakfast (concern is high) that I only covered 3 of 19 Local Resident Councils (LRC) before DHA folk asked me not to petition.
Angela Fletcher, the new top person in DHA, admitted that the candle and incense ban is DHA’s (Finally!). They're for lower insurance rates (Like to know how much.). She seemed shocked by the push back over these bans. Lots of questions. I thanked her for allowing us to use our barbecue and for acknowledging the ban, but shouldn’t DHA have published and taken comments on their ban as HUD and DHA’s rules dictate? She said it was legal. She also said DHA will hold some meetings.
During lunch I quickly passed out contact and education information before being asked whether I was petitioning, again. I gave them copies. Dion took me aside and explained that they would prefer LRC motions passed up to the RCB. I agreed to follow their procedures.
Talked to people from Mountain View Tower and Eliot Cottages. We decided to finish the petition at this site and present the signatures with the motion, encourage all LRCs to make motions and decide whether or not to petition, too. Apparently, petitioning at other sites is against the rules.
Whether or not we are smokers, we object to new HUD rules that prohibit smoking within 25 feet of our supported residences and DHA’s ban on candles and incense.
Many of us appreciate or will appreciate the help to cut down or quit smoking, but no one appreciates being forced.
Since HUD’s analysis of the ban is anti-tobacco, we ask for a benefit cost comparison with balanced ‘reasonable accommodation.’
Finally, we thank DHA for allowing barbecue and taking credit for theirs, but the candle and incense ban needs hearings and comment.
We are mostly disabled, elderly and poor. Sending such smokers into the weather is often a health risk. Sending vulnerable folk out to the periphery of the property opens many to internal and external predators in equally desperate situations who look for marks. How does it reflect on Housing Authorities to have disabled and elderly standing on the public sidewalk smoking? You have already failed to control illegal drugs, now you can fail with tobacco. Some residents are quite angry.
Non-smokers are shocked and agree the ban is mean and over-reaching, what conservatives call ‘nanny state’ or a true example of ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ Even amid Boston’s much touted success, they admit the ban is resented, stresses all, a few smoke more and non-smokers are little concerned about second hand smoke but do feel empathy. Many cut down by snuffing a cigarette or pipe after a few puffs, and know they’ll smoke more with an enforced ‘smoke break.’ We know employees feel for smokers. HUD’s policy of reasonable accommodation is broken: The ban divides smokers and non-smokers, just as race, religion, sex and more are used to divide and conquer. (Just as Prohibition and the War On Drugs have proved more costly and harmful than effective, so too we should keep tobacco discussions above ground.) The ban affects a specific class of vulnerable people, only, which is illegal. We make no claim of a Right to smoke, but smoking is legal. Yet to enforce the ban invades our privacy, which is unconstitutional.
We are mostly elders in our twilight years who helped our younger generations use much less tobacco. You and we helped our children balance these vices, yet now you punish us.
Perhaps the answer lies in precedent: Minnesota includes apartment smoking as a reasonable accommodation. We can accommodate smoking in apartments where smoke does not drift to other apartments or correct such second hand vapors of any sort. DHA, like many Public Housing Authorities, has smoking and smoke free buildings. As numbers of especially elderly smokers in supported facilities decrease, so will the number of smoking sites while construction improvements will last. This voluntary segregation of smokers and people who do not object is legal. Precedent also says we have paid rent on our apartments, sometimes for decades. The smoking ban need only apply to public areas.
Many feel we could compromise from smoking in apartments to smoking on balconies or porches, as many already do. Especially when balconies or porches have barriers that break wind currents to adjoining apartments, or wind barriers are easily constructed, smoking should be allowed on balconies and porches. Both would be best, but we could accept one or the other given the construction of our units or buildings as reasonable accommodation.
We understand that nicotine is the most addictive substance known to man and doubles the risk of many maladies. Nicotine is also the only stimulant that is more a mental than a body stimulant. Data indicate chemical additives are more the problem than tobacco itself. While smoking causes many problems the most ardent anti-smokers are former smokers, though we actively appreciate their trauma, don’t smoke in public areas and ask if any mind elsewhere. Most of the cost complaints of cleaning smoky units come from landlords who don’t want to paint or even use a damp cloth. Still many of us could handle a small increase in Damage Deposit, as a reasonable accommodation.
As Stakeholders we know of no one who was informed of this ban coming or offered a chance to comment. Yet apparently anti-smoking advocates were informed. So we make this motion, now, as is our Right.
We ask that HUD build a team who would stand with us do a benefit cost analysis including smoking ban secondary costs of defiance, homelessness, resistance, litigation and loss of trust and openness, compared to the economic benefits of partnership and balance with minor air flow corrections. You know social services stimulates the economy, which returns more taxes that spent, yet these bans could harm that return.
Separate but intertwined with HUD’s smoking ban, DHA’s new policy of no candles or incense is worse, adding insult to injury. Our residences are very fire safe. HUD discussed and overtly did not include these in their ban. We thank DHA for again permitting barbecues and owning up to this ban but as stakeholders we ask for hearings and a vote of the people as some of our City Council have suggested over smoking in parks.
Catholics and other Christians burn candles, Jews use the menorah. First People cleanse with sacred sage smoke and Buddhists used incense long before aroma therapy, all as our free religious practice. No romantic candlelight dinners or birthday candles with grand-kids? Would you stand idle, when power goes out for 18 hours like last Christmas at Mountain View and Eliot Cottages, and your parents say, “Don’t worry about me, I’ll just sit here in the dark.”
Again, as your renters we appreciate your help. Doing good is your mission, but so is our dignity and choices. We ask DHA to pull back from Dominant/Submissive culture and lean toward Partnership culture. Honesty is essential to make our system work and gain the economic boost from social services that returns more to government. We hope you will join us and push HUD to more balanced reasonable accommodation. With the rise in power of those who blame victims, we ask our federal and local authorities to stand with the most vulnerable. We will also contact other residents and public housing authorities, our representatives and advocates, but hope you will ease these Draconian rules.

Separate from HUD’s smoking ban, DHA’s new policy of no candles or incense is worse, adding insult to injury. Our residences are very fire safe.

Whether or not you are smokers, you know many who object to new HUD rules that prohibit smoking within 25 feet of our supported residences. More are shocked at DHA’s parallel ban on candles and incense. This model petition hopes to start a groundswell of interest and to educate concerned residents, certainly within DHA and hopefully across the nation. Most agree that smoking is a problem, but forcing many to quit is wrong, aside from the dangers and lack of HUD and DHA’s usual ‘reasonable accommodation.’
Whether or not you are interested, have time or energy for this project, as leaders, you know those who do, from interested or knowledgeable, to those who will take this door to door. The petition may be altered to suit your local concerns, or electronically copied at the site below. Also please connect, again below, with others who might like to copy your ideas. A 20 signature sheet is also here and at the website for copying. Please make copies of your petition for those few who actually want a copy and to include when your people submit. You can make a big production of your petition submission to HUD and DHA, perhaps all of us together or just fax them at the numbers below.
The official HUD rule comment period has already passed. Yet as very definite stakeholders, we were only informed after. Anti-tobacco groups seem to have been informed before. Still in politics all is open for review and appeal. DHA has held no hearings we know of, contrary to DHA and HUD rules. We will be opening a national petition online, as soon as we can and after we bring in the residents of DHA, you, us. We don’t want to threaten HUD funding, but we would like DHA to push back for us. We are early in exploring our options, so stay connected.

Ok so I guess I should title this post Mommy Fail! That is totally what I did. We were all excited about Ben's first Tball practice and I knew it would make a great post for tonight. To post about Tball practice you need pictures and to get pictures you need a camera and/or a working phone. Since I had neither I guess it was not meant to be!
Today was just one of those days! It was a super busy day when everything had to be perfectly timed. It got off to a rough start when my phone froze up and wouldn't work. So I just had to wait for the battery to run out. That took 12 hours. I had to go all day without a phone. How did we used to survive without a phone at all times?
So I rushed home from work to get Ben to practice on time and totally forgot the camera! Oh well. He had a great first practice. He had lots of fun and we think it is going to be a great season. Don't worry I will post lots of pictures from the next practice!

The first film using the AUTOFOCUS-O7 rules, from pre-production to post-production, it took no more than 4 hours to get made.
Using the AUTOFOCUS-O7 rules written up the night before, "The Mugging" was written very quickly with the full concept mentally written an hour before everyone would meet for shooting, and the roughest-looking script written down on a clipboard an hour later.
This is in contrast to the many halted long-term projects we have; "The Mugging" took no more than 4 hours to be conceived, shot and released.

Donald Trump could face felony charges after allegedly bribing Ben Carson for endorsement – DeadState
Republican candidate Donald Trump could soon be facing criminal charges after Dr. Ben Carson let it slip that the real estate mogul offered him a quid pro quo for his support in the presidential race, according to reports.
In an interview with the conservative TV program “The Steve Malzberg Show,” Carson admitted that Trump allegedly promised him a cabinet position in exchange for his endorsement last month.
A criminal complaint was also filed with the Department of Justice by the watchdog group American Democracy Legal Fund on March 15th :
Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 599, “[w]hoever, being a candidate, directly or indirectly promises or pledges the appointment, or the use of his influence or support for the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment, for the purpose of procuring support in his candidacy shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if the violation was willful, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.”
Dr. Carson’s comments strongly suggest that Mr. Trump promised him an administration position in return for his endorsement. In his interview, Dr. Carson stated that he would “certainly” have an advisory capacity within a potential Trump administration. When asked directly whether this role was discussed during their endorsement meeting, Dr. Carson responded, “Yes.” Dr. Carson’s assured answers lead to the reasonable conclusion that Mr. Trump promised Dr. Carson an administration post in order to secure his endorsement in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 599.
According to Think Progress, Trump may be guilty of a felony due to the fact that Federal law expressly prohibits candidates from directly or indirectly promising the appointment of any person to any public or private position or employment, for the purpose of procuring support in his/her candidacy. The penalty for violations could include fines or a year in jail — two years if the violation was willful.

Hey Tracy, I just wanted to come vent here and say hello and let you know that I’m utilizing your blog a lot this week as an emotional support. I’d been clear (caveman-clear, like no attention paid to my skin and it was perfectly clear) for over a month, my scars were fading, etc. But I had a huge stress arise right at the time my period came and, a week later (three days ago now), boom-boom-boom, three big-sized and three little-sized zits sprung up all at once, just randomly during the course of a single day, all in the same place on one cheek–talk about PTSD. I was shocked, and a I cried, and this terrible coursing wave of anxiety hit, and keeps hitting over and over. I can feel the flush in my face when that anxiety stirs, and I know it’s all related, so I literally needed to come to thelovevitamin.com just to feel a sense of not being alone… You provide a sense of strength and hope when it feels SO isolating. I feel like my I let my bf down when this happens, and I shrink away from him, can’t even look at him in the eye, can’t bare to walk past a mirror, can hardly breathe… It’s so completely unbearable by the time we get to 6 months of waiting for the clear skin to stay and then BOOM Such a disappointment. It makes all the difference in the whole world to be able to come here and hear from you that life does go on and that it’s okay (not just okay, but important!) to work on my emotions while I’m suffering, to accept that my face is a bit of a mess but that it will pass and that others can testify that I am not crazy–that this really is traumatic.
I’m really enjoying the theme/design of your website. Do you run into any web browser compatibility issues? A few of my blog readers have lamented regarding my garageband download free site not working appropriately in Explorer but appears awesome in Opera. Have you got any advice to aid fix that situation?

This time last year I was hyping myself up about starting my job search. During my last year of graduate school, “the search” was all that anyone ever really cared to discuss. The “if, when, and where” Faith would find a job. They did not bother to ask me how I was doing or how I was feeling….for some reason, they were more concerned with where I had plans of applying to, what kind of jobs I was looking for and how they could be “supportive” (I was grateful, but some of the advice was unsolicited.). My job search process had many layers, so I thought that I would share my successes and roadblocks during my journey. I have a lot of thoughts on this, so definitely check back in as there will be a series of posts related to this topic.
Starting the job search really required me to be introspective about what I wanted out of life. I realized that I had to have a picture of what I wanted my life to look like…even just three years out –I had to make plans. My masters degree is in Higher Education and Student Affairs, and my assistantship for two years was spent working in a live-in position in university housing. The field of student affairs is so large; there are many different sectors that I could have potentially entered into as a new professional, which required me to assess what I wanted my future to look like. If you know me, you know that any type of life planning is difficult for me. As time drew closer, I had to reckon with the possibility of working in residence life full time (something I had been against since undergrad….that’s a story for a different time), or branching out into something different.
Before revamping your resume, before brushing off your cover letter and reaching out to your references, here are some things worth considering and some questions you may want to ask yourself:
What is important to you? This can be a hard self assessment, but I believe that it is an important one. In looking into your professional growth, what things are you willing to accept and what things are off limits? What are your non- negotiables? I am a city girl and have lived in Houston all of my life, then I relocated to Dallas for undergrad and Columbus, Ohio for graduate school (don’t believe the hype, Columbus is very much a city). There is no way that I could live in a small or rural area and be happy. I interviewed at institutions that were located in off-the-grid places in an attempt at challenging myself but the minute I walked on campus, I knew that I could not work there.
Do some research about jobs in your field to establish what realistic compensation looks like for your education and work experience…do not be tricked into settling for less when you are worth more. Evaluate what you believe is a reasonable time commitment and what you value in an institution and a department. For example, if diversity is important to you, do not settle for a place that has no interest in hiring diverse people or that is not commited to doing diversity work.
When I was job searching, everyone came out of the woodwork to give tips and tricks on what I should be doing. For the most part, people’s advice was much appreciated but there came a point where I started listening to everyone else’s voice and not my own. I created my own personal board of directors! These are the type of people that were on my team to help me succeed:
As a new professional, I knew that I did not have it all together. I knew that when it came down to understanding what experiences I needed to have, how to stand out in an interview or how to negotiate salary and job expectations, I would need extra support. This is where my mentors came in. They were experienced and had been in my shoes before and could help me better understand how to navigate the job search process because of their prior success. They understood many of the intricacies that I did not fully think about or understand. When starting the job search process, identify people who have taken a similar journey,hold a position that you hope to obtain, and lean on them for their insight and guidance.
Never submit an application without the honest feedback of someone that you trust. Writing resumes and cover letters often feels like a never ending task in the job search. Have a few trusted friends and mentors in rotation who are willing to read over your resume and application. With this, know that people have different expectations and experiences with how they believe resumes and cover letters should look — assess what works for you and your profession and go with that.
My personal board also consisted of my motivators and cheerleaders. Although they did not fully understand my job search process, when things got tough I knew that I could go to them to lift my spirit. Don’t underestimate the stress that comes with the job search. Like most things, you need people who are going to remind you that things will work out in your favor..
When you are exploring the possibility of obtaining a new job or entering a new profession, self doubt and/or the imposter syndrome can often be ever present and discouraging. Questions that can ring loudly: What if I am not qualified enough? What if my experiences aren’t what they are looking for? How will I survive in new city or new environment? Embarking on a new journey can be both scary and fulfilling. Submit the application. Go on the job interview. Talk to other employees. Never count yourself out (my friends say “don’t self-select out); your potential may be exactly what an organization is looking for and you may never know if you don’t take the first step. Think again about your non-negotiables and evaluate if you are operating out of fear or faith — it makes the difference.

“Back in September, a group of Czech artists called EPOS 257 camouflaged themselves as city-workers, went to the Palackeho square in Prague and installed a fence. The fence was left on the square with no apparent intent or explanation. At first, the city council didn’t know about it, and when there were told, they didn’t know how to deal with it – what if somebody put it there for a reason? The fence stayed for 54 days before being removed."
The Guerrilla Innovation blog sees this intervention as a disheartening example of our willingness to cede our public space with little protest - that our individual right to space and freedom are easy to curb.
F.A.D. responds with a more accurate analysis - public space is "deeply conditioned by social norms." If construction fencing is erected, most passers-by will assume it has been placed for a good reason.
EPOS 257 also chose a spot that, while very public, doesn't seem to inconvenience anyone to any high degree. People place a certain level of trust in the visual language of the city in order to navigate its complexity, and while this can be subverted to very interesting ends [see related], I wouldn't draw the same ominous conclusions.

"Dark garnet/plum/purple, with loads of spice, earth, underbrush, red and black currants, licorice, and even a hint of Provencal garrigue, this full-bodied, tannic, masculine style of St.-Julien needs 5-6 years of cellaring, but is full, beefy, rich and impressively endowed. There are plenty of firm tannins in the background of this blockbuster wine, which has been built for the long haul. This is one 2010 where patience will be required.

In 1757, Mr. Gruaud grouped a number of small vineyards together to form one large one, under his name. Eventually a descendant of the first owner took over the property. His name was Larose, and he immediately linked his name to the estate, bought by Mr. Desire Cordier in 1915. Managed under the direction of Mr. Georges Pauly, the highly respected director of Domaines Cordier, Gruaud Larose is one of St. Julien's most popular wines. Its large production has a quality that is consistently very high. One of the most continuously successful wines produced in Bordeaux, regardless of vintage.
The wines are full bodied, but elegant with lots of fruit when young. They age very well and develop all the characteristics of a great Bordeaux, tending to be smoother and more elegant than many contempories. The 1997 is

Take the helm of your steamship and set sail for the unknown! Sunless Sea is a game of discovery, loneliness and frequent death, set in the award-winning Victorian Gothic universe of Fallen London.
Set-up ropes over the terror wards, found zombies, attacked them and inadvertently set off multiple traps.
Fought through the skeletons. Found some Altars, which they started attacking, Tasil widened a big crack in the back of one. Nachi finally kneeled and gave praise to Bahamut as the altars asked. The skeletons disappeared. Note-to-self: attacking altars of good-gods might not be advisable when trying to stop undead.
Entered a tomb, and talked to Sir Keegan. Learned some back story. Diplomacy is good and might net you a decent sword. Promised to help stop the evil that overtook Keegan and seems to again be returning. We need to close some sort of rift.
Explored the caves. Fought some rats and an Ochre Jelly. Entered a secret cavern. Explored a section that contain some Kruthiks. Enter a door that said do not enter. Found a little island guarded by a big Blue Slime, which ended up killing Nachi and Splug. It turns out that, when you find a room beyond a door that says “do not enter” with seemingly unguarded treasure on an island, it might not be a good idea to fey-step to the center of the island – lol.
Returned to town, which was closed off. Agreed to help Lord Padraig clear out the undead in their cemetary, but first had to heal up. Revived Nachi and Splug with Sister Linora’s help. Exchanged and bought a few new items from the passing merchants trapped in town (i.e. took full advantage of their need for our services).
Went to the cemetary and fought some more skeletons, some zombie dogs, and an elf archer named Ninaran. Another note: not all elf archers are friendly, especially if undead appear around them. Shut down the magical circle that created the skeletons. Found a note on Ninaran from Kalarel.
After a quick search of their options, the group decides to head east, where they stumble upon a few goblins and drakes digging for treasure. The sneak up on them and a battle ensues. At one point Sophana and Hanibal try to walk across a plank and fall into the pit. Luckily, Nachi was there to protect them and Tasil cleared out the room with pinpoint accuracy.
Then they discussed the merits of taking the secret door Sophana found or going down the eathern stairs. They decided on the door.
They stealthily sneaked up the passage to another secret door, where a very fat goblin noisly slept. A conversation then ensued on what to do and Tasil and Nachi whole-heartedly agreed on sneaking in and killing him in his sleep. Allyria felt that doing such a thing was wrong but deferred to her more adventure expreienced teammates. Sophana and Hanibal seemed to acquiesce as well. So Tasil sneaked into the room and drove a dagger deep into Balgron the Fat’s belly. Nachi followed soon after to take down the guard behind the curtain. Hanibal attempted to help, but inadvertently burnt down the old curtain.
Afterwards, Tasil explored the other rooms, while everyone else lied in wait to spring an ambush. Tasil found two goblins on guard playing cards and took them out in a blinding fury of daggers. He then proceeded to peek in the barracks and bait the other goblins into the ambush. It only took a few short moments before the surrounding goblins were defeated.
The party returned to Balgron’s chamber and slept. It was an uneasy sleep with the stench of dead goblins creeping into the nostrils and a sense of evil and unrest permeating their dreams.
After a rest, the party continued their exploration of the halls and rooms. To the west the came upon a room where they heard the excited voices of goblins. Tasil peeked a glance through a crack in the door and discovered a torture room with a hobgoblin yelling and threatening a couple of goblins. Tasil relayed the information and the party decided to attempt another ambush.
Tasil opened the door, through some daggers, and ducked back into the hall. The goblins fired off crossbow bolts through the doorway and the hobgoblin ran to a corner beside the door, hoping to push the first person who entered into the nearby iron maiden. The battle degraded into a shooting fest with Tasil, Hanibal, Allyria and Sophana attacking from the hall and the goblins peeking up from behind the tables. Finally Nachi charges in and takes the battle to the awaiting hobgolin and the goblins in the room. Tasil jumps into help, followed by the others, and it isn’t too long before the battle’s over.
Down the way, they can hear some pleas for help. There’s a goblin locked in one of the cells. He introduces himself as Splug and promises to help them however he can. Tasil picks the lock and frees Splug. The party helps Splug collect some armor and weapons off the dead goblins and Splug informs them of all the rooms he knows, which just happens to be all the rooms they’ve already been in.
It boils down to the cave with rats, or the dead quiet room behind the chilly doors. They choose the cold room.
Walking down the chilly stairs into the pitch blackness, they light a sunrod and cast light. With this they’re able to see a magical rune etched into the floor, which they can tell is some sort of trap. They travel down the halls that aren’t marked and come across a group of zombies. They all pitch in, including Splug, and with some impressive action on the part Sophana, eradicated the zombies.
This opened the way to a hall lined with large sarcophagi and a bright blue light glowing at the other end. Nachi systematically opened the closest sarcophagus, ready to destroy anything that made its home in one, but to no avail. Every single one he opened was emptied. As they walked down the hall, a loud cacophony was heard as every sarcophagus closed and immediately opened, spewing out skeletons.
Before entering under the waterfall and into the kobold lair, the adventurers stumble upon a wizard entering through the woods. He introduced himself as Hanibal and they discovered they were after the same thing, the end of the Kobold Menace, so they joined forces.
Together they passed through the waterfall into the kobold lair, where they encountered a dozen or so upset kobolds. After our heroes cleared out most of these troublesome creatures, in walked Irontooth, a strong goblin who had been bossing the kobolds around. Irontooth knock our adventurers around but after 3 sharp blades in back sent with regards by Tasil, he went down for the count.
The party searched the cave and found some gold and a +1 Dwarven Chain Mail. They also discovered a note signed by Kalarel.
As they walked back to Winterhaven, they came across a kobold patrol. Hanibal, quick to prove himself to his new friends, ran up and fired off a massive fireball into the patrol, that wiped out all but two of them. It was quick work, picking off the remaining two.
The party returned to Winterhaven, and collected the reward. The townspeople were happy to hear the kobolds had been dealt with, but everyone felt a little on edge.
They brought back the body of one of the kobolds, and showed it to Valthrun the Prescient, who did some research with the help Sophana to discover it was a kobold dragonshield and that they have a resistance to fire. The two then began researching the history on the keep located north.
They learned it was built by the old empire, Nerath, to guard against a rift into the Shadowfell and not against marauders as originally suspected. This rift led straight to an unholy sanctuary of Orcus. The empire fought the undead who entered back into the rift and sealed it up. They then built the keep over it to make sure it stayed closed. Two decades after the fall of Nerath, the commander of the keep, Sir Keegan, went crazy and killed his family and officers before the rest of the garrison were able to drive him deeper into the keep. Soon after that the keep was abandoned and has since turned into ruins.
Our heroes travelled down the main road to investigate the current situation of the keep. As they got closer to the keep, a chill came over them and the normal sounds of the forest began to die away. The overgrowth seemed to be everywhere, except in a circle around the keep. After cautiously checking the area, the heroes bravely walked down the steps into the keep.
They were met by a goblin, who saw through their ruse of being sent by Irontooth and tricked them into a pit trap filled with rats, which Nachi was kind enough to peruse. Three more goblins popped out behind some corners and proceeded to pepper the heroes with crossbow bolts. Our heroes collected their wits and wiped out the goblins, leaving them time to think over their next course of action.
Our hardy adventurers, Sophana, Tasil, Nachi, and Allyria, went on a quest to find the whereabouts of Douven Staul, last suspected to be in the area of Winterhaven.
They were ambushed by some kobolds while traveling down the King’s Road. After an exciting battle, during which Nachi got hit with a gluepot, they continued on their way to Winterhaven.
Upon entering the gates of Winterhaven, they got the lay of the land and met some of the villagers at the small inn Salvan Wrafton and Eilian the Old. They also met Valthrun the Prescient in his tower. They had a talk to Rond Kelfem about the kobold infestation, and arranged an appointment with Lord Padraig. Lord Padraig offered them a reward to clear out the kobolds, which they gladly accepted.
On their way to investigate the where-abouts of Douven Staul, our adventurers were ambushed by a much stronger group of kobolds. It was a tough battle where every one was knocked unconcious at some point in the battle, but with some quick thinking and hardy resilience they were able to take out the assailants. They recoverd a necklace with a ram’s horn design that Sophana and Allyria both recognized as representing Orcus at the same time.
After such a tough battle, the party made the quick trip back to town to rest and recover. In the morning Tasil attended the Avandra service and then had a chat with Sister Linora. Afterwards, they tooka trip to Bairwin Wildarson’s store where they got a free healing potion and Tasil bought some climbing gear, left, came back to check prices on leather armor, left, went back in to buy the armor when Allyria discover she had enough gold, left, went back in to price a few more things, and left for the final time.
They headed south to the old dragon burial site where Douven was last known to be, this time without being ambushed. Upon arriving there, they were greeted by group led by a gnome named Agrid, who invited them down to view their recent discovery, an ancient mirror. Sensing something was amiss, the group declined and a battle ensued. They took on a couple of Guard Drakes, a few weak humans, Agrid, and an annoying halfing with a deadly sling. When the dust fell they released Douven from his bindings, who thanked them and gave them his locket/amulet of health +1. They escorted him back to town, and from there, he made the return trip home.
While in town the group asked Valthrun the Prescient for info on the mirror. He informed them that it appears to have belonged to a wizard of the old Nerath kingdom.
Starting from the most recent ambush, the group haphazardly tracked their way to the kobold lair. They hear kobolds in a river, so sneak through the trees and clean out all the guards in the front, preparing their to the actual lair behind the waterfall, where Irontooth awaits.

The Second quarter is almost over which means HALFTIME is around the corner! Attitude is another intangible which separates the wheat from the chaff. It truly regulates how we progress as officials and is part of our over all composition. A good attitude is crucial in everything we do and is an on going process. It begins, in officiating, with a self evaluation of why do we do what we do? My hope is that we officiate to continue to be a PART of a game which impacted us as younger people. We should not be the game. So how do we accomplish a good attitude?
It begins with how we approach our assignments. We must take care not to complain or gripe about getting too many youth games, too few “BIG” games, or not getting the rewards which we feel are the benchmarks of our success. Do I always want the 1 vs 1? You bet I do! Do I complain when I get the 2-5 team vs the 3-4 team? NEVER! If we get caught up in rankings and other side issues we are not going to present a good attitude to the players of the teams we work. I previously stated that I have always approached every game I have worked with the same dedication, commitment, and work ethic; regardless of level or standing. Put our feelings aside and remember that we are lucky to be part of the game. I hear officials complain about their assignments and I have noticed that those who complain the most seem to be the very officials which work the least at improving themselves. A positive attitude means we go to our meetings and participate in a cooperative manner. Use your local options to improve your association instead of merely griping.
Check your day at the car door when you arrive at the game. The players did not cut you off in traffic, they did not get on your case at work, and they did not create the turmoil at home. Players are not idiots. They sense when we are hostile or on edge and it feeds the potential for negative situations and poor administration of the game. Attitude also carries over into the crew you are working with that night. We all have to work with officials we do not like or do not respect. But it is imperative that we put that aside when we walk into that pre game. We are a unit and must function together, not as four individuals trying to impress someone or inflict psyche damage. If an official makes an incorrect comment we must take strides to find a neutral, non-threatening way to counter the comment. I usually take out the rule book and mention that I may be confused. I stress that it is important that WE are right as a unit and not as individuals. I work hard at not appearing condescending or intimidating when difference arise.
I also will do whatever the Referee asks, even if it is not the way the I would do it. Case in point, if the referee wishes to deviate from the mechanics book I will offer my opinion. If he holds firm I will cede the point and do it. I may evaluate him on this and I may discuss it with him after the game but I am not going to have a chip on my shoulder about it. I feel a positive attitude creates the best environment in which I can work. I try not to emit an aura of “EGO” when I am the LJ working with less experienced referees. I truly don’t care what position I work; I am confident of my skills and do not see this as a slap in the face. Instead I try to offer input which will help that Referee become a better one. I always remember the excellent help I received and want to pass the baton to those coming up behind me. I don’t view them as the opposition taking away MY game. The same applies when I am being butchered on the field. I never criticize officials during the game. I must work hard not to share or show my frustrations with weaker officials. I try to remind myself that I am not perfect and that sometimes we learn from our mistakes best when they are approached with a positive spin rather than a negative one.
Had a game with three inexperienced officials this year. The Linesman ruled a fumble at the goal. When I asked him on the field he was adamant that the ball came loose prior to crossing the goal. After the game he commented, “Too bad he didn’t touch the ground in the end zone or he would have scored.” When I nudged him for more info he said that the runner leaped from the field of play, extended the ball across the goal and then dropped it. It was not a TD because the runner did not touch the ground before fumbling. I could have yelled at him, I could have told him it was a bad call, or many other approaches. What I decided to do was to have the entire crew research the question in the post game. My hope being that he would learn better from all of us reading it rather than my “offering an experienced opinion”. A positive attitude is more conducive to growth.
Attitude is also important in our dealings with coaches. I know that there are coaches who shudder when they get the assignment and see my name on it. I do not allow this to influence how I will approach them. I don’t brag about getting them, or putting them in their place. Now don’t read that I am a perfect human being. I will joke with certain officials about the game before or after but never on game day. I shake their hand firmly, talk in a calm, deliberate manner and offer no reason for them to feel that my personal feelings will affect my judgment or decisions.
Watching other officials...always be careful what you say while a spectator. For a variety of reasons I am well known in our area. When I go to a game I sit as far from the crowd as possible. If I want to make a “negative” remark I make certain that no one other than the person I am speaking to can hear me. I also never offer an opinion when asked by spectators. I remind them that we are not on the field and are not privy to what is actually going on. I don’t get hooked by wanting to prove how much I know by offering information when it has no bearing on anything. What good can come from my telling those around me that the crew or the official screwed up.
Attitude is also measured by how we arrive at the game. Cut offs, sweat suits, etc. are comfortable but they tend to say that we are taking this game a little lax. Attitude is not complaining about having to work the chains, not wanting to write down important information, or other common displeasures. Attitude is observed by how we physically handle the game. If I walk in and casually drop a flag what message am I sending? Again, one that I don’t want to be there.
Dead ball periods; do I joke with the crew, do I joke with chains, do I stand with hands in my pockets, arms folded, or do I stare into the crowd or at the cheer leaders. This also sends a message which I feel is negative.
In short, we must work at our ATTITUDES so that the game is fun, fun, fun. After all it is a game. Am I perfect? No way. I have to work hard in this area and I am not always successful. When I fail, I note this in my log and try not to repeat the offense. Here then is my check list:
1. Allow travel time which will get me to the game site early enough that I am not going to be stressed by time.
3. Stop my tom foolery once the ref begins the pre game-I have a reputation for being a jokester and I must refrain from being the center of attention once we start
4. Walk onto the field with authority and precision-not a robot but as a professional-regardless of the game
8. Cooperate with crew as a unit don’t challenge but inquire don’t argue but offer opinion and then move on leave my ego in the car
10. Remember, the game is more important than I am. Don’t get defensive when challenged/questioned on the field. Correct my errors on the field not after the game own up to mistakes and learn from them don’t be critical use other’s mistakes as learning tools have FUN

Walking into local pub, Peadar Kearney’s, on a Saturday night has the effect of transporting you to a better world. It’s not just that thesmoothly flowing drinks or the traditionally decorated space evoke a kinder, gentler era—it’s the atmosphere created by the excellent Brian Brody that takes you to a time and place outside and above the normal muckabout Dublin Saturday night.
During a recent show at Peadar Kearney’sBrody revealed his ability to bring a crowd together. As a consummate storyteller, he works his guitar and his voice to tap into the primal themes of the human condition. He moves easily from traditional ballads to rousing rock—engaging the crowd in a friendly banter.“Be loud because I’m about to be!” he urges the room before he launches into a rousing rendition of The Irish Rover and the crowd roars back.
As he works the crowd, he creates a community of strangers united by his music and the warm atmosphere of the pub. During a roll-call of sorts he moves around the room calling out the countries represented in the audience:Ireland, Ireland, Ireland, America, Cezch Republic, Ireland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Ireland, Ireland, England, Ireland. In a neighborhood where pubs can often be dominated by hordes of tourists, this time and place feels authentically Irish because it is.
Needs a good closing that ties Peadars back in talking about it being te perfect venue for live music and intimate crowd settings.
I read this quote in Joe McNally’s book, Sketching Light. I read that quote a year ago and never put it into practice until I retired from UPS. Now I’ve been actively seeking new and interesting places to get my camera in front of. Also, I love driving so road-tripping is an added bonus.
I had never even heard of Sloss Furnace before four weeks ago when I attended my first meeting of the Roswell Photographic Society. After my second meeting Tuesday, I am just so grateful that I’ve been able to start attending because I’ve only benefited from the knowledge and hospitality.
Sloss Furnace in Birmingham, Alabama. It’s a quick two hour drive right down I-20 West. On my way down I listened to episode 101 of the SeanWes podcast, How to Find Your Passion. There’s Sean and his co-host Ben Toalson. Sean is a very established, very successful entrepreneur and Mr. Toalson acts as kind of a straight man who pings questions off Sean as if he were us; very new, aspiring entrepreneurs even though I think he does pretty well for himself. I like this approach, its a very relaxed conversation about escaping the cube farm and all the psychological blocks that go along with that. This week the topic was how to find your passion. A few questions from Sean to help us figure some things out.
I’ve been intensely focused on photography for years, and lately dedicating more of my time to learning the basics of business.
All I want to do is find the most beautiful, obscure and interesting things to photograph, but I need to build my life to support this goal.
9:16 Welcome to Alabama! Central Time Zone…wait, wat! So I was late, and now I’m not late!! Already having a great time!
10:14 Somebody lets us in (yes, there is line now) But he can’t let us in the park…what the heck is going on here?
The trip was well worth it. I walked the area for a while then start to explore. I gained a little courage from some other tourists and went into a pitch black room. I snapped a few images w/ my on-camera flash because when they went back up the stairs so did I. I went into the main building and had to give pause because of the realization that these old, dusty machines used to be in operation. I imagined the noise, the bustle, the heat, the activity that used to take place. I just retired from UPS and I feel like I stepped back into my shift for a while. I was surreal. Documenting this place was relaxing. It’s quiet there, unlike a lot of tourist attractions. The visitors come in, look around and take it in, and there’s ample time and room for everyone to set up and take their time photographing. I used my new remote to make sure everything was tack sharp, and because it’s relatively dark I needed a longish shutter speed coupled with my depth of field.
I processed these using Nik (Google) SilverEfex Pro 2, of course, and decided to treat them with a slightly warm tint. I might actually print three of these four as a triptych. We’ll see. I’ve been trying to print more lately.
I have not planned a trip for this Saturday, because I’ll be visiting my family in SC, but I’ll be sure to make up for it next Saturday and Monday!

Children’s Aid Societies in Ontario have the exclusive mandate under the Child and Family Services Act (CFSA) to protect children who have been or are at risk of being abused and/or neglected by their caregivers, to provide for their care and supervision where necessary and to place children for adoption (CFSA, 1990). A total of 46 Children’s Aid Societies are specifically designated by the Minister of Children and Youth Services to investigate child abuse and neglect and take the necessary steps to care for children and youth in need of protection. Seven are designated Aboriginal societies and 3 serve religious communities. Children’s Aid Societies are independent legal entities (corporations run by Boards of Directors) or Indian Bands (that operate under the Indian Act) and are accountable to the communities they serve. In addition to the CFSA, the Ontario Child Welfare Eligibility Spectrum and Child Protection Standards guide child protection workers at each phase of service delivery. For more information, visit the information sheet on Ontario's child welfare system.
§ Child welfare services fall under the jurisdiction of provincial and territorial authorities, making it difficult to compile statistics at the national level. The most notable variations between provinces include mandate variation by jurisdiction with respect to the age to which children are eligible for services, differences in the length of time a child can receive out-of-home care and the definition of out-of-home care.

The first Catholic Mass in Cincinnati was celebrated in 1811 in the house of Michael Scott. It was celebrated by Dominican Father Edward Fenwick, who would later become the first bishop of the new diocese. The house of Mr. Scott was on the west side of Walnut St. halfway between Third and Fourth. The first Catholic Church building was erected outside the city limits under the title of Saint Patrick in 1818 at the northwest corner of Liberty and Vine. The first Mass was said in this church (now Christ Church) on Easter Sunday, April 11, 1819. Two years later, Pope Pius VII formally erected Cincinnati into an episcopal diocese with Edward Fenwick O.P as the first bishop.
Because of the difficulty of getting to the little church, now his cathedral, especially over the mud roads of winter, Bishop Fenwick purchased the Sycamore Street site and had the little cathedral put on rollers and moved to where our church now stands. Fenwick dedicated it to St Peter on December 17, 1826. Bishop Fenwick died in 1832 and was succeeded by Bishop John B. Purcell. Bishop Purcell bought additional property on Sycamore Street next to his cathedral and established a seminary and college there. Then, in 1840, he brought in the Jesuits to run the college and seminary. Meanwhile, he had begun to build a new cathedral at Eighth and Plum. When it was dedicated in 1845, the title of St. Peter-in-Chains was given to the new cathedral. The Jesuit church and college on Sycamore was then placed under the patronage of St. Francis Xavier. The seminary, retaining its name of “ Athenaeum of Ohio,” moved to Price Hill in 1848.
The title of "parish" was returned to St. Francis Xavier when the cathedral relocated. The parish has been under the direction of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) since 1840. The present brick edifice with sandstone facing and ornate clock tower was built in 1859. Although a horrific fire damaged this building in 1882, it has since been restored and renovated.
Xavier University and St. Xavier High School were founded as a "college" next door to St. Xavier Church. Those two institutions have since moved to separate locations due to space constraints and expansion: XU in 1920 and X High in 1960. Today the parish church serves the downtown community with two daily Masses, six weekend Masses, daily confessions, and service outreach to those in the downtown area.

Did you know that you have to see a new word at least five times before you can usually use it and include it in your ‘active’ vocabulary?
In your classes, students will have a valuable opportunity to pick up new vocabulary on a variety of topics. It is a good idea for you to encourage your students to revise this vocabulary on a regular basis in order for students to take ‘ownership’ of these words and to start to use them confidently.
If you feel that sufficient effort isn’t being made to record new vocabulary it’s well worth talking to your students and asking them how and where they record new words that come up in class. They may have a notebook where they write the new words or they may have no system in place. All students should be encouraged to make an effort recording vocabulary in an orderly way. Suggest to the class that they have a special vocabulary book. Depending on their preferences and learning styles the notebook can include pictures and mind maps. It doesn’t have to be just a long list. Suggest to your class that they carry this book with them and use the time spent waiting for buses or sitting on trains to have a look through and test themselves. If you are learning their language and somehow recording new vocabulary you could bring in your notebook (or whatever you have to keep track of new words) and show them how you are making an effort to extend your own vocabulary.
Apart from encouraging your students to keep an orderly vocab book of some sort, another way of having easy access to the words that have come up in your classes is to create a ‘word bag’ for each of your groups. All you need are two large envelopes and some strips of card. Write on one envelope ‘Blank word cards’ and ‘Class Word Bag’ on the other. Cut up lots of small strips of card and put them in the ‘Blank Word Cards’ envelope.
Every class, nominate a student to be in charge of the ‘word bag’. He or she should be given the envelopes at the beginning of the class and is responsible for writing all the new vocabulary on separate blank word cards and putting them into the class word bag envelope. If this isn’t practical for your group, you can be responsible for putting the words in the bag after each class. If you can keep the envelopes in the class you teach in, pinned on a cork board or in a safe place, it will be easier for you to keep track of the bag. After a few lessons you will have a good selection of words in the word bag.
Here are some activities for using the word bag to recycle the voacabulary. They can be used at the beginning of a class as a warmer or at the end to fill up the last five minutes.
Pull out a bunch of words from the bag. Give clues or definitions so the students can guess the word on the card. The student who guesses the word correctly, wins the card. The winner is the student with the most cards at the end.
Read a sentence incorporating the word on the word card. Instead of saying the word, say ‘beep’. Students guess the missing word. When students get the idea, pass them the word bag, so they can create their own sentences.
Give each student a word card. You start and begin to tell a story and use the word you have on your card. When you have used your word, the next student continues the story until they can incorporate their own word.
Divide the class into teams or pairs. Pull out a set number of words and using translation or clues give the teams a vocab test!
The more you use the word bag, the more uses you will find for it! I find that students feel a sense of security, knowing what vocabulary will be checked and they can also get a great sense of achievement when they feel confident using new words. Acquiring vocabulary takes a lot more effort for many students than we and they would like to believe. The word bag helps to avoid the feeling that new English vocabulary is a ‘bottomless pit’! It can make the learning experience more tangible and achievable

Essential Thor volume 3 reprints issues #137-166, bar an Inhumans back-up strip that ran in issue #146 to #152. Everything is by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The stability is further enhanced by all but one issue being inked by Vince Colletta.
It's the format of the series which demonstrates the most variation. There's a final epic "Tales of Asgard" back-up feature which gives way to an Inhumans back-up strip then the second half of the volume sees issue length stories set in the present day. This is a series that has found a firm purpose as a mixture of Norse mythology and cosmic space adventure, with most time on Earth mainly serving as interludes between the big events. Thor is almost completely bereft of a human supporting cast with Jane Foster only making a single cameo to show she is getting on with her life and now has total amnesia of Thor. The other outstanding human element is also dealt with in a respectful way that confirms what the series has evolved into.
Throughout the volume Thor retains his identity of Donald Blake and his medical practice, although it's increasingly a sideshow. The two identities are by now clearly established as the same being but curiously when he's in the form of Thor he seems to lack Blake's medical knowledge. It's understandable that Thor's large hands and huge strength would not be suitable for delicate surgery, but less so that he would not know as much. And we finally get a resolution to the longest running uncertainty in the series so far. Issues #158 & #159 finally address the confusion about the main character - how can he be both the original Norse God of thunder with a life stretching back over many centuries and yet also a mortal man who discovered the hammer and gained the body and power of Thor? As he says, "If I am truly Thor... then who is the real Donald Blake? And if I am Don Blake... Where was Thor before I took his identity??" The first issue incorporates a reprint of Journey into Mystery #83, exposing the contradiction starkly as Donald Blake ponders the matter himself. (It also neglects to reproduce the original credits, a failing the Essential's contents page repeats) Then in issue #159 we get "The Answer at Last!" (the story's title) and learn how Donald Blake has been Thor all along. In order to teach his son humility, Odin had forcibly changed him into mortal form and given him both amnesia and a physical disability so that he would know weakness and learn "that any handicap can be endured... and overcome!" and sent him to Earth where he arrived in mortal & lame form on the first day of medical school with artificial memories. The hammer was disguised as a stick in a cave to await being found once humility had been learned.
This is one of the first overt retcons in Marvel history, with the original state of affairs addressed head on and explained away, rather than being simply ignored or flashbacks altering the original events. It may well have been driven by incessant questions on the letterspage and/or by the first generation of fans now working for Marvel, but in general it represents an elegant attempt to reconcile the original idea of a man acquiring the power of a being from mythology with the subsequent shift to depicting the adventures of the actual being. No retcon is ever perfect and this one doesn't explain how Blake could suddenly appear in adulthood with no recorded past, or why, if Thor is deemed to have learnt his lesson by now, he still has the Blake alter ego. But the biggest omission is any explanation as to why it took time for Thor's original personality and memory to come to the fore. Nevertheless the retcon has stuck to the point that any latter day readers are surprised to discover Thor and Blake were ever depicted any differently. I am aware of only one attempt to retcon this again, from the mid 1990s, and that was so convoluted and ultimately inconsequential that, as far as I am aware, it has been generally ignored and forgotten about every since the writer in question left the series. (If you don't know the details it's probably best to keep it that way.) But here we get Lee and Kirby putting almost a finishing touch on the character's background, overcoming the confusion from the earliest days of the series when they weren't in full control of it.
Thor's identity may have been cleared up but he retains his medical practice and loyalty to Earth, going so far as to defy an order from Odin to return to Asgard. At this stage Odin is acting somewhat out of character, being more power obsessed and angry than normal, and he opts to punish Thor once more by stripping him of all power bar his strength. The same subsequently happens to Loki, Sif and Balder. The power is eventually restored but in the meantime we see Thor trying to survive on his wits, unable to even revert to the form of Blake, and eventually taking a job with the Circus of Crime as a strongman who pretends to be none other than Thor himself. This leads to his being hypnotised into taking part in a robbery. This, even more than his Blake form, truly humbles Thor but also shows there is more to him than his powers though he does eventually regain them.
The series continues to thrust forwards with a good mix of existing and new elements. The early issues contain the final (for now) "Tales of Asgard" feature focusing on Hogun of the Warriors Three as his village is attacked by the sorcerer Mogul of the Mystic Mountain, leading to an epic journey as Hogun seeks vengeance. Successive issues show the group battling their way through a variety of monsters as they search for Mogul, with Volstagg's laziness and cowardice often on display along with excuses for it. However he also demonstrates his skills when he secures the Rod of Wondrous Wizard Power and uses it to deal with both beasts and Mogul's army. There is debate between Hogun and the others over how much help he should accept from them in his own duty to his people but ultimately the four journey together. This story is generally okay in collected form but five pages a month for nine months must have been tedious for contemporary readers and it's easy to understand why the feature is dropped for the time being.
The main strip doesn't hold back on character creation with this run including the first appearances of various trolls, of whom Ulik is the most notable. Others seen from the Troll kingdom are the ruler, Geirrodur, and his slave, Orikal, a mysterious being from another realm who is held captive to power the trolls. There are the mysterious Enchanters, made up of the trio Magnir, Forsung and Brona, who rule another dimension and now seek to conquer Asgard. In one brief adventure Thor battles longstanding Avengers foe Kang the Conqueror and his new weapon, the Growing Man. Another sees Thor take on both the crime boss Slugger Sykes and the ever adapting android Replicus, who feels like another variant on the Mad Thinker's Android and the Super Adaptoid. Asgard comes under attack from the Trolls and the Enchanters but the biggest threat comes in the form of Mangog, the gestalt embodiment of a race defeated long ago by Odin. Mangog is a giant monster that seems impossible to stop as it rampages towards Asgard to seize the Odinsword and cause Ragnarok, the ultimate day of destruction, making for a desperate struggle to stop him.
Loki's schemes and improvisations are responsible for a number of battles including with pre-existing foes such as the Super Skrull but also new ones. In order to regain his own powers Loki turns to Karnilla but at the time when she sends the power Loki's helmet has been taken by a burglar known as the Wrecker and he gets empowered instead. Armed with a now enchanted crowbar, the Wrecker takes on the role of the ordinary mortal empowered by Asgardian magic just before the retcon removes the last possibility that Thor himself falls into this category. Still the Wrecker makes for a good physical foe.
The last few issues see Thor in deep space, this time helping the Rigellians to confront Galactus who in turn is going after Ego the Living Planet. This leads to a confrontation between two very different kinds of gods, with a dramatic showdown. Later Odin shows part of the origin of Galactus. Following this there's another confrontation with Pluto and finally a battle with the mysterious "Him" (later renamed Adam Warlock), created by the Enclave, now seeking a mate and settling on Sif. Thor defeats him but is now succumbing to the Warrior Madness and has to seek redemption. The volume ends with Thor about to embark on a deep space expedition to achieve this.
In some of the adventures Thor is fighting solo but at times he has regular aid from variously the Rigellian Recorder, Balder and Sif. Balder is built up as a good loyal ally of Thor but faces his own problems when Karnilla falls for him and goes courting in her own unique way, even turning to the sorceress Haag to enchant him. But it's Sif who's given the strongest attention. Time and again she is shown as a strong warrior and though she's not a physical match for Thor she can more than hold her own. The affection between the two is strong though it brings its own dangers when Karnilla tricks Sif's spirit into occupying the Destroyer to help Thor only for the armour to overwhelm her, take control and nearly kill him. Later she takes a blast intended for Thor and nearly dies, but Blake's skill as a surgeon saves her. The two work well together and she is a far more suitable companion for Thor in this style of adventure than Jane Foster.
Although there are some problematic pages, in general the reproduction in this volume is quite good and in particular reproduces Vince Colletta's inks sympathetically. Also of note are some of the later issues where in certain shots space and/or Ego appear to be represented by photographs of either paintings or sculptures - it's a bit difficult to tell in black and white but the actual pages have reproduced quite well without the mix of line drawings and photographs turning into the mess seen in other volumes.
As a whole this volume shows a strong coherence and direction. With the totally consistent presence of Kirby and Lee this volume feels like the definitive take on Thor. Over the three volumes so far they have tried and tested a variety of elements and refined them to the point where it's now clear what works. At the same time they have either explained away or steadily phased out some of the more problematic elements. The result is now a solid run showing the series at its height.
A real merchant will find opportunity in what others would just discard. The situation is similar on the dying world of Outland, the shattered remnants of Draenor, which the merchants of the Black Market have take an interest on. Relocating all the way from Dun Morogh, the merchants have decided to set shop in the lower parts of Shattrath, the City of Light. Opening their doors up for the Horde, the Black Market is on a stride towards a new era. With the assistance of Ethereal traders, Shattrath City might just become an important trading hub between worlds if given time. Time will show.
The Black Market have yet again a new location and a new fancy name. For those unfamiliar with these events of past, The Black Market is a recurring public roleplaying event centered around Trading. As the title may suggest, The Black Market is a place where you can find anything between earth and sky, including potentially dangerous goods and goods acquired by not perfectly honest methods.
People coming to the event are encouraged to bring their own merchandise for sale. There will be no NPC providing goods. The vendors at Lower City do sell all manner of things but all things beyond that will be brought there by other roleplayers. The goods for sale on the event can be purely emoted, actual ingame objects or items created by Gryphonheart Items addon. No actual in-game currency change hands but the exchange of coins is simply emoted, unless the seller demands otherwise (such as in the case of actual ingame objects).
The Event is primarily hosted on the Alliance, but with the new location being to a Sanctuary, Horde players are encouraged to make an appearance to the Market. Just find someone who can relay your messages to the players of the other faction.
It changed name and location due to In Character events. Dun Morogh became a much less ideal place to host the market when the Dwarven Senate restarted, followed by investigation to the market, wanted posters and Warlock murders. Such environment is bad for business for it scare away customers. Thus, the Market relocated to another location.
A turnout of about 15 people in total, probably a few more. I'd say that it was a pretty decent turnout.

"Big John" Hernandez, the Forensic Specialist at the Brownsville (TX) police department, showed me, at my request, a binder filled with images of dead people he's had to photograph over the years. Most of the people didn't resemble humans, but I could make them out when Hernandez pointed to where the eyes, ears, nose and mouth were supposed to be. I felt woozy at page three and the possibility of fainting two pages later. I closed the book, put my head down, and he brought me a cup of water.
Thirty days later I witnessed, for the first time, a mutilated body like the ones in Hernandez' collection. School kids walking home found a person floating face down in a pond underneath a bridge just around the corner from my home. The police say she was a mentally unstable women who had been missing for three days. As I'd seen in Hernandez' photos, calm waters are surprisingly destructive to human flesh. She was purple, coming apart in some places, and bloated up like a balloon, her skin stretching beyond what I thought was possible. I knew my paper wouldn't run the type of photos that the Matamoros (Mexico) papers do - the bloodier the better - so I didn't have to photograph as closely as i did.
"Somehow it's easier to look when it's real," I said to Hernandez, as we looked at the body from a distance. "You examine the pictures more closely," he responded.
The police at the scene let me photograph wherever I pleased, which was not the case when I was a new face in town. This was the second time my efforts to establish a positive relationship with the police, fire, or EMS have paid off. The first being when the Fire Dept. called my cell for a house fire.
The writer at the scene, who had access to see just as much as I did, asked to see the photos we weren't publishing. I acquired the tight shot of the woman's face. She was purple, with blood lines running up and down her skin, no eyes, her tongue exploding out of her mouth and brain matter oozing from her nose and ears.
I had a hard time getting the woman's face out of my mind as I raced to photograph the assignment this spot news delayed me for: a candle light dinner at an assisted living residence to kick off Grandparent's Day. That was the first day I was thankful for the fluff.

Petrox™ delivers active, rapid bioremediation of environmental contamination caused by industrial and commercial hydrocarbons.
It contains a highly-concentrated solution of live, strains of lyophilized (freeze-dried) Pseudomonas organisms that occur naturally in the earth’s ecosystem. These cultures are free of pathogens and there is no artificial mutation or genetic engineering involved. Extracted from a once-contaminated site and isolated under controlled laboratory conditions, these “hungry bacteria®” have only one purpose in life: to seek and destroy petroleum hydrocarbons, organic solvents, and semi-volatile hydrocarbons at their source, and then quickly convert them into harmless, naturally recyclable by-products.
Site closure often occurs in a matter of weeks or months versus several years or more for other methods, giving users the combined benefit of fast site closure and remarkable cost savings.
Available in a standard blend or custom formulated for specific needs, Petrox can be used as a highly effective stand-alone decontamination solution or as a powerful augmentation to speed the remediation of existing treatment systems.
Each Petrox product batch is manufactured under sterile conditions, and subjected to stringent quality control protocols before release for shipment.

You do not need to install it to tune your vehicle. It plugs into the vehicle’s ECM diagnostic connector and sends the tune directly to the ECM. Once the tune is flashed to the ECM you can remove it or leave it connected to view real-time data while the vehicle is running. If you want to view real-time data then you can install it using the supplied Velcro or using an accessory mount with AMPS pattern (30mm x 38mm, M4-0.7 thread).
No. Re-flashing the vehicle’s ECM is accomplished all through the device. You may need to connect the supplied USB cable to a Windows PC to load a custom tune file onto the device or for any firmware updates.
I see you have a Power Commander V and also the Power Vision CX for my vehicle. Which one is better?
The Power Commander is a piggy-back device that must be installed to function. The Power Vision CX is a re-flash device that doesn’t need to be installed. Both will give you more performance and improved drive-ability by adjusting the fuel & ignition, however, the Power Vision CX allows tune changes that can only occur by re-flashing the ECM such as: lowering cooling fan turn on temp, disabling torque limiting functions, and revised drive-by-wire profiles. The Power Commander offers faster real-time tuning through the device whereas the Power Vision CX requires the ECM to be re-flashed after changes are made to the tune.
The Power Vision CX includes one vehicle lock, that means you can tune the vehicle that the device was originally “married to”. In the near future, a feature for retail and commercial customers to use single Power Vision CX on multiple vehicles will be available.
The first type of tune file is an STK file, this is a copy of the original tune. The second type of tune file is a DJT, this is Dynojet’s modifications to the STK file.
Our DJT files are really a subset of a STK file. The STK file is a complete tune, the DJT is just the portion where we have made changes. When you open or flash a DJT, you are also opening or flashing the STK file with the same compatibility.
The DJT file is really just a small portion of a complete STK tune file. When you open a DJT file, the software will look for a STK file of the same compatibility. Make sure to save your STK file and DJT file in the same directory.
First make sure that you are using the correct version of PowerCore software. This version will start with 1.10.xxxx.xxxx. If that is correct try holding down the top and bottom buttons on the face of the CX unit, while plugging in a USB cable that is connected to the computer. This will cause the CX unit to go into Boot mode, and Windows may install drivers that will resolve the issue. Just let Windows churn for a minute or two, then disconnect the CX unit, and reconnect normally.
The Power Vision CX can hold up to 32 individual files, either DJT or STK files. An STK file is much larger than a DJT file. There is a limited amount of memory on the CX unit, so it would hold 32 DJT files, but not 32 STK files.
Every time you open a DJT or STK file, the C3 software will look for a definition file. The definition file tells C3 how to work with a given compatibility tune. You will need Internet access to download this file. If one has previously been downloaded, you will not be prompted again, unless we have updated the definition file. You can see a listing of downloaded definition files in C3 by clicking on Tools/View Loaded Definitions.
When flashing a tune completes, you should wait for the ECM to power down before attempting to start the engine. If you are experiencing this issue, flash the compatible STK file, and be certain to wait about 45 seconds before attempting to start the engine. Once the engine starts, you can then flash the DJT tune file you like.
Why does my Power Vision CX not show tune files when connected to vehicle, but will when not connected to a vehicle?
When the Power Vision CX does not see an ECM of a vehicle and you go to the Flash Tune menu, it will show Files at the top of the screen. If the PVCX can see an ECM, it will show Vehicle Files. This is by design. If the PVCX can see an ECM, it will only show tunes that match the connected vehicle.
Most likely the cause for this condition results from not having the required USB drivers installed. One method to try and resolve this condition is to put the PVCX into “boot mode” by holding down the top and bottom button on the unit, while plugging in the USB cable. If the Manage Hardware now finds the PVCX, you can attempt to update the firmware. If this is not successful, please email PVCXtech@dynojet.com and we’ll send the drivers and instructions to install them.
If you updated the firmware on your PVCX, you need to update your PV_Info file, and resubmit. On the PVCX device, from the main menu, select Device Tools, Device Info, About. Press the top button, next to the pencil icon. It should respond with File Created, as it writes a new PV_Info file.
On drive-by-wire vehicles, the ECM controls the throttle position, trying to maintain a commanded idle speed. So you will see throttle position vary.
These common terms all relate to a vehicle that has a computer controlling the butterfly valve in the throttle body, as opposed to a cable operated butterfly valve. When you move the throttle grip or accelerator pedal, an electronic signal is sent to the ECU where it then decides how far to actually open the butterfly valve. There are two common types of ETC; torque based and command based.
When plugged in via USB, the Power Vision CX should mount to your Windows computer as a USB drive. You will be able to browse the contents just like a USB memory stick. You can save the required files to flash your ECU (original .stk file and tune .djt file) directly to the PVCX.
Last week I if you saw my blog I had an awful vibrating solid-mounted 1710cc crankshop triple asphalt sled brought here because of fuel flow issues (shutting off at half-track). From 6500-8000 the carbs were a blur, 90 lb/hr fuel flow was all we could muster couldnt support 300hp for more than 4 seconds. I bought a piece of aluminum strap and bolted it to the tops of all 3 flatslide carbs to tie them together hoping to settle them down. That actually made fuel flow worse. After maybe fifteen seconds of run time, the surface of the smooth aluminum bar and carb tops were fretted where they contacted each other.
Is that fretting localized melting/ transferring of metal from bar to carb? That would mean the small contact surfaces are reaching 1200 deg F from friction.
We switched to a brand new smoother running 1710 engine (turns out the first engine's crank was out of phase), added some rubber to the motor mounts, and fuel flow was good with just the right fuel pressure
Also Ive had a question posed to me by a guy on the internet about changes in torsional vibrations in the wicked turbo boosted big bore F1000 twin with about triple the stock torque output (and 414hp instead of 165 stock that I just posted on DTR), but operating at stock RPM. This guy has a boosted Yamaha RX1 or apex, and he's galling clutch parts, so he's suspecting that the same would happen to the Arctic Cat big twin. The twins are a little buzzy stock, and 280 lb/ft is maybe not constant, probably rising and falling twice/ revolution? could it be 400 lb/ft relaxing to 100 lb/ft twice/ rev (somehow averaging out to 280)? If I use a solid non rubber shaft from the engine to the absorber, there's a way of using an oscilloscope to observe/ measure the torque spikes each revolution. I did that once after I built the dyno 20 years ago to ensure that my lord soft rubber couplers were doing their job, and the oscilloscope was nearly a flat line.I should do that again with a solid shaft with stock, turbo, and N2O added to see what the crankshaft is putting up with. I could also do that with a Yamaha 4 cyl, which has some rubber in the output shaft gear I think, which probably gets wound very tightly under boost.
motorsport17 is teasing because he knows I have bulletproof glass in front of my face looking out into the dyno room, but 5/8" drywall in front of my testicles. That's why Glenn, Jason and Dale were fighting to get that seat right behind me in the control room to use my body for a shrapnel shield. Also galling clutch parts are in my opinion due to torsional vibes not pure torque.
I would have thought that a 2 stroke 1000 would have more torsional vibration then a 4 stroke yamaha.
Cliff that is more of a Q for Kevin Cameron than me. Surely the stock F1000 crank is smooth enough at operating speed from say 6500 to 7800, but they surely have some evil vibrations between idle and clutch engagement where you dont spend much time at. Glenn has nearly triple the stock torque of the engine, so I bet there are worse torsional vibrations with his monster turbo than stock due to the increased torque peaks two times per revolution, winding up and unloading the crank, maybe 50% harder, twice each revolution even though he's operating at stock RPM.
My only first hand experience with aggravating torsional vibes in a 4 cyl 4stroke was my old Suzuki GS1100 that I big blocked to 1394cc plus larger cams. once modded this thing was loaded with torsional vibrations. Though I couldnt feel anything while riding, the vibes were evil enough to continually snap the socket head cap screws that attached the inner race of starter sprag clutch to the flywheel on the left side of the crank. The inner sprag race is a light thing, probably incapable if having enough inertia to snap bolts regardless of the severety of the vibration. So what I think was happening was at some RPM, dont know where, the flywheel was actually going backwards for an instant, driving the starter ring gear into the starter drive gear like an impact gun, eventually shearing the bolts. I think this happened twice, then someone sold me a set of grade 10 bolts or something like that that all big bore modded Suzukis required. Problem solved, but surely the life of the sprag clutch/ gears would have been short had I put many miles on it.
But I had done four things to create the evilness in the crank--heavier pistons, way more torque, higher revs, and straight cut gears between crank and countershaft plus a clutch basket nearly devoid of the soft springs that normally soak up vibrations from the right side of the crank (the starter drive and flywheel are of the left). I don't know which aggravated that Suzuki crank the most, maybe it was a combo of all four. But you have to appreciate how bad the vibrations were when you think about the crank end actually going backwards for an instant one or more times per revolution at some RPM between 1000 and 10,000 (maybe at several different RPM).
Kevin Cameron has addressed this in the archives on my website, and he may be able to elaborate on pure torque increase and effects on torsional vibrations. That's another issue I will raise the next time I talk to him. But if Glenn eats up his 6-weight clutches I suspect it will be from mostly from increased torsional vibration, not just the added twisting force.
Early computer-controlled engines had cam position sensors to tell the computer which cycle they are on. Now they do without - they just use the speed difference in the crank to tell them (I guess the engine sparks at every TDC during start-up). So, yes, there are very large speed variations, especially with singles and twins - enough that they give the two cylinders different fuel and ignition maps. Enough, for example, to toss the valves prematurely because the instantaneous cam speed is high. One speed variation comes from the actual cylinder firing, and others come from the steady exchange of kinetic energy between the pistons and the crankshaft (which is twice per revolution).
Nearly every race engine in history has had to have special attention given to the cam drive during development, because crank/cam interactions, through the flexibility of the drive (or lack of it, just as often) create problems. Cosworth make a trick torsion spring that goes in their gear cam drives, and has with it a stack of tiny clutch plates compressed by a diaphragm spring, to absorb the oscillatory energy at the speeds where it tends to get out of hand. Ducati found they had 32nd-order torsionals in their camshafts. They made a big improvement when they changed from ball bearings to plain - every plain bearing is also a hydraulic shock absorber. The oil pump refills it and the thumps of valve acceleration squeeze the oil out of the bearing.
Torsionals were a HUGE issue in the development of the large radial aircraft engines. Generally they had a 4.5-order (firing frequency) and a 2nd-order (secondary vibes coming from the asymmetry of the master-and-links con-rod system) dynamic counterweight on the crank - really massive things that swung back and forth, alternately storing the excess energy from a cylinder firing, then giving it back as the firing impulse died away. When this wasn't right, pieces would vibrate off the tips of hollow steel propellers - chunks about 18" long, going about 500-ft/sec. Or the prop reduction gears would crumble, or the shaft crack, &c. It was a major part of development - hours and hours of running tests to get the crankshaft system stable.
A few years back the NASCAR guys were floating the valves in the back of their engines. This looked like cam twist so they bored some blocks for bigger bearings, increased the cam base circle, and made some experimental cams on bigger tubes. Imagine their surprise when they got LESS power. After a while they figured out that enough valve float to increase time-area, but not enough to wreck the parts, was what was happening. SO next they designed cams to float intentionally, and gradually learned how to design the ski jump so the skier didn't lose his balance when he landed after the jump. At first, these were used just for qualifying. Now they use such "lofting" cams for 500 miles, and the Europeans are calling them "Ballistic valve trains". I think it can work only because NASCAR engines don't run across a wide range of RPM. The guys at Spintron have books and books of development records of this kind.
The old 1100 Suzuki GSX-R (like the one we did the cam rolls with [at your dyno for Cycle Magazine]) had serious torsional problems down at 6500 - endurance teams that ran them that low broke cranks. So they went to the US Cosworth importer, who made them up a replacement crank out of trick 4340 material. Broke in the same place.
Similar story with the Honda twins that have staggered crankpins. When they run at higher revs, the two flywheels clapper back and forth like a lo-frequency tuning-fork, straining the shit out of the crankpin fillets, which crack. First thing the rider knows, the crank "feels funny". Then BLAMMO, it becomes two-piece, and the bike slows right down.
I think there is a driveline resonance in my Cobalt, which is just building up as the engine is pulled own to about 1350 in top-gear lock-up. Then the shift program clicks in 3rd, before it gets too noticeable. It's like "fan growl" that you feel more than hear, in airliners - maybe 80 cycles or so.
Back in the 1930s engine researchers had their choice of two different types of torsiometer for measuring the action. Lots of engines had trouble with magneto, supercharger, or other accessory drives failing because they were getting so much chatter from the crank. Gears broke, shafts spiral-fractured, stuff fretted to death.
Yes, friction is caused by welds that occur at the very tiny points of actual contact, and must be broken in order for sliding to take place. Temperature is high, but in such tiny places. The wear particles oxidize - when they are iron-based, it makes the familiar red powder.
Yosh used to try to get away with no spring drive between the engine and gearbox. Sometimes it worked. Other times it just broke parts. The spring drive is very old. When Napier offered the first in-line six for sale about 1903, the vibes caused the cam drive to chatter audibly. Master salesman and early racing driver S.F. Edge called this "power rattle".
When Rolls brought out their six, they weren't having this problem so after having a wood friction damper catch fire, they came up with the idea of the spring drive. On their wartime Merlin V-12s they effectively cut the crank's free torsional vibration length in half by making the center a node. This they did by connecting the front of the crank to the prop via a springy quill-shaft, and the back of the crank to the accessories by a spring drive just like what's in every motorcycle clutch.
There were all kinds of failures when Diesels with long lightweight cranks were put into subs, driving the props directly. There had to be lists of forbidden rpm at which the crank could not operate for more than a couple of seconds. To solve this, the US Navy adopted Diesel-electric drive (same reason it's used in rail locos) so the Diesel would run at a constant safe speed and the props could be controlled separately.
A stewardess was killed on a commercial flight NY-Miami in 1948 by a piece of prop tip, coming through the fuselage like it wasn't there. Metal remembers every insult - cumulatively.
Your instincts [regarding high combustion chamber pressure] are correct - Diesel engines, with their very high compression and high combustion pressures, need much "deeper" spring drives. ZF Transmission gives their trannies a double spring drive for Diesel applications. They say it improves fuel consumption by about 6% (a lot) because the driving torque converter element rotates more smoothly, and does not advance in a series of eddy-producing jerks, which are wasteful.
This is why I have missed you these past years - we've had so many good conversations in which we try to think of explanations for observed phenomena.
Steve Weinzierl had that case of the prototype triples that Fuji had built for Polaris a number of years ago. They all broke cranks in testing (20 of them, and not cheap either!) and the Polaris people were just throwing up their hands. Steve, in his methodical way, got out the thick books on crankshaft math simulation and plowed through it all - approximating the flywheel discs as separate masses and working up all the shafts as torsion springs. And the math showed about what they had - a bad maximum at 8500. He added 2-mm to one or two shafts, parts were made, and on test everything was sweet and calm.
I remember that the word on the street was to avoid 8500 on 600 or 650 triples, something bad was supposed to happen there (even if they strengthened parts no sense pressing luck). Its good now to know how that info came about. So triple pipe makers all stayed at 9000-9200 except for Aaen who had peak hp at 9800 as I recall.
Also remember I was having Ron Chastine map the EFI on my Bender 3 cyl Exciter (an extra throw and rod pressed onto the original 2 cyl), Dyno mapping 55 gallons of gas thru the engine, steady state at all throttle positions, all RPM we surely found the RPM where resonant frequency (?) was the worst and spent enough time there to hurt parts. The flywheel taper and crank taper were welded together in a small spot, instead of a nice pop removing the flywheel with a puller, it sort of gooed off, like pulling apart a piece of licorice. About 3mm diameter chunk was pulled from crank taper, welded solid into the flywheel taper. Jim
I have many times in crank rebuilding seen such welded regions. Once I took apart a crank from an early-model 500 Kaw H1 streetbike with 50,000-miles on it. Both mainshaft press-fits tore extensively on the way apart and the pieces had to be scrapped.
In the early days of British motorcycling the common 500 single had two cast-iron flywheels, a tapers-and-nuts crankpin, and a pair of mainshafts. As rpm got up near 5000, all the shaft started to work loose - the iron was no longer strong enough to maintain the tightenss of fit against the rising stress. So they began to use steel wheels, and then later, alloy steel.
It's interesting to see that the US lagged behind Europe (notably, France) in adoption of alloy steels. Schneider-Creusot began to offer nickel-alloyed steel in the 1880s, and Winchester adopted it for gun barrels after 1895. But top brands of US cars had their cylinders cast in nickel-iron and their nickel-steel crank forgings sourced from France before WW I. All US artillery designs traced back to French originals, right through WW II. The French were the first with the quick-firing 75-mm gun, which thanks to its hydraulic recoil gear was still aimed at the target after recoil - the whole gun no longer "retreated" at every shot. So all the gun crew had to do was keep slapping shells into its breach.
I think it was the Triborough Bridge near NYC, that was made of 3 1/2% nickel steel. Everyone was so horrified at the cost that they adopted the much cheaper low-silicon steel, which is what the Titanic was made of. That stuff was very poor in corrosion resistance, so as US manufacturers made more and more requests for better materials, suppliers did the necessary research and little by little the alloyed materials we know came into being. Now that the US is rapidly de-industrializing, I hear it's not so easy to get even basic stuff like 8620 or 4340 steel stock - "Sorry, special order only - there's no call for that stuff any more".
Suzuki 2-stroke flywheels were always almost file-hard, but Yamaha stuff was a lot softer - if you put a dial gage on the OD of a flywheel you could "see" the bulge caused by the pressed-in crankpin.
5/7 Jim Cooper's PS1000 triple Skidoo asphalt racer, dialing in new MSD ignition last Friday had a bad timing pickup so were waiting for a new one. Before the pickup went bad, we had Megatron fuel flow inconsistencies (solid mount twins are usually the worst, solid mount stroker triples are almost as bad). Jim had trouble at the racetrack with this, usually dropping 500 revs from half track on regardles of clutching. I'm betting the carbs were foaming like they are doing on the dyno. Along with new MSD pickup, Jim's getting larger, viton N&S's to try. Looks like Thursday AM/ PM. Got the MSD working again, turned out to be a missing crankcase bolt allowed A/F mixture to escape into the flywheel area and foul the MSD crank trigger. But those carbs are still giving us fits, fuel flow is 86 lb/hr at HP peak must be milkshake in the float bowls. Will try agian Saturday, mess with adding weight to carbs, fuel pressure etc.
Thurs AM sliding Jim Cooper's sled off the dyno, cameras off, private tuning session for another pro racer, Jim Cooper will be back on to finalize his tuning late thursday. Private session was Glenn Hall's first crack at dyno tuning a Boondocker turbo system/ D&D F1200/ Firecat (he was concerned that we might fumble this and he didn't want to goof on camera). Off the trailer it was effortless 325ish at 10 psi boost. So we spent the day cautiously tweaking boost/ fuel/ timing/ exhaust components, gradually working up to 286 lb/ft torque and 414 CHP at 15psi boost!!! This pretty good HP for a Firecat chassis. This AM I'm going to put that HP screen up on the dyno computer, set it up to contuously replay the 400 plus HP tuneup dyno run.
5/9 Justin Fuller with turbocharged Yamaha 1000cc streetbike, maybe an R1 using the Cycledyn eddy current roller dyno to dial in boost/ A/F ratio. Justin's still not quite finished with kit, will reschedule.
5/10 Justin Fuller has the R1 turbo system done, will dyno tune this PM about 4:00 Easy to fine tune, same fuel management as Justin uses on Apex turbo kits, made 200 DJHP on pump gas at the rear tire at 5.7 psi boost. Everything is hidden under the fairing, stock mufflers are used.
5/12 Finishing Jim Coopers PS1000, then Steve Bennett from West Virginia with CS1710 asphalt sled with fueling issues once more. Short on time, pulled Jim's sled off the dyno to redo fuel system and add 5 lb of mass to Lectron carbs and will be back. Since Steve Bennett's last trip to dyno where we had bumped fuel pressure to 6.9psi to overcome foaming float bowls, then made 321hp, Steve was fine for most of the season. But then he added n2o and snapped a conrod, replaced crankshaft and vibration was worse and fuel flow became impossible once more. Back to Batavia. On the dyno carbs disappeared into a silver blur at 6500 and no juggling of fuel pressure could make carbs deliver usable fuel flow--either 140 lb of fuel flow and float bowls went dry or add 1/4 psi and fuel flow went to 250 lb/hr and drowned the engine. Frustration over a vibrating engine with solid motor mounts. Tomorrow AM Jim Cooper is dropping in a brand new CS1710 engine into the solid mount chassis, hoping this is smoother and if we can see the carbs, maybe we can get decent fuel flow for 8.5 seconds. We have difficulty with most solid mount long stroke engines.
5/13 Jim Cooper spent today dropping in the new 1710, after transferring carbs/ ignition from old engine. Tripod Dan brought some rubber mounts which we used to isolate the engine mounts from the chassis. After an hour of sputtering trying to start the engine (glad we have electric start) on the dyno we discovered the new engine's keyway was about 100 degrees off from the old one. Jim would come back tomorrow with his degree wheel/ dial indicator and figure this out.
5/14 while Jim was indicating the old engine, we discovered the crank was out of phase. Could this have been the source of excessive carb-foaming vibration? Jim rotated the MSD flywheel to align it properly with the trigger, and we were running. Now from 6500-8000 we could actually see the carbs, and even though the mechanical fuel pump was inadequate the Holley pump was tweaked up and down to where we got smooth fuel delivery without drowning the engine. Fine tuning timing and jetting netted us 229 /b/ft at 7400 and 328 CHP at 7700. Smoother due to better crank balance and/ or rubber isolation of engine from the rigid chassis.
5/15 AM Robert Murray with Bill DiFranco's D&D F9 engine that he bought from the guy in Canada who Bill sold it to. Robert bought the engine only just as when LT Bill had it, except a reed change, Robert added his own 03 ECU and it was way too fat on top end, way too lean in midrange. He brought another 03 ECU from his other Firecat, this one was 10 lb/hr fatter than the first one. We tuned it to add midrange HP by adding fuel there, but we couldnt get the top end perfect. Robert's Boondocker had the original program with not enough steps for a twin pipe engine (only 6700 and 7800). We got the fuel perfect at 7800, but fuel drops as revs climb to 7900 and beyond to deathly lean. He's sending the Boondocker back to have D&D's program installed (he pays D&D $75 but ships it direct to BD). Then he'll have a step at 8200, use his current settings for 3000-7800 then add a particlar number at 8200 that should flatten out his declining fuel flow as revs climb. The engine now makes the same torque and HP as when Bill dyno tuned here a two or three years ago.
Just sold my 90 Exciter with Bender Avalanche triple/ IRS EFI, but my pipes are still missing after I loaned them to Mark Forte in NJ for testing at New England dyno service 15 years ago. Need to buy another set if anyone has some hanging on their garage wall please email me. I found out that Mark Forte still has his Avalanche with MY pipes on it (he said that to the fellow who bought my sled from me--he also said that his were lost in shipping to Jaws for modification). I plan on getting my pipes back.

If you need to find a home in the Bahamas, one that is a luxury home, you will need to choose specific websites to find them. This is a wonderful location, off the coast of Florida, and is considered to be one of the nicest places to have a vacation. Instead of traveling there for just a few days, or stopping by on a cruise, you may want to consider living there at some point in time. If you have the money, start looking at some of the luxury homes Bahamas listings currently available. This is an overview of Better Homes and Gardens MCR Bahamas Group and how they can help you buy and sell real estate in the Bahamas.
The websites that will have luxury homes listed will showcase a multitude of them. Not only will they offer homes that are for sale, but they may also allow people to sell them as well. Similar to regular real estate websites, they are going to have properties that can be found based upon a keyword search, property type, status, and the minimum and maximum price. You can also choose the island that you would like to live on, as well as the community that you would prefer being part of.
This is a company that has been presented on Better Homes & Gardens. Essentially, it is the real estate section of their website. You will get to see all of the different products in the Bahamas that are currently listed through them. They will also have additional information such as posts that are on their blog, and you can even schedule a time to get an appraisal. This information is very valuable for those that are selling. It allows them to pick a relevant selling price. When they are able to do so, they can usually attract more buyers by perhaps pricing it just under the appraised value in order to get a few offers.
The reason that you should work with this real estate website is that they have a team of professionals that can provide you with the latest information. If you are looking for a home, or if you are trying to sell one that is currently in the Bahamas, they can help people achieve both goals. When you arrive at their website, you can simply choose from the drop-down menu. They will have links to how you can buy, sell, or even lease the homes that are there. There is also immigration information, and also info on how you could become an investor in this very prominent part of the world where so many people vacation.
You can visit the Better Homes and Gardens MCR Bahamas Group website to find out about selling or buying a home in the Bahamas. You will see the latest listings for homes for sale, and those that you can lease, giving you a general idea of what to expect. If you do plan to stay in the Bahamas for longer than a few weeks, you may want to consider purchasing something there on a permanent basis. On the other hand, if you are going to be selling one of your many properties in the Bahamas, there is no better company to work with than MCR Bahamas Group.

Innes Callahan, is a male witch character in a number of my books. I picture him tall and thin, with long black hair and steel blue eyes. In one dream sequence he appears as Cernunnos, the Celtic horned god. This image came through my Facebook feed and it was him. He’s even standing in the river. (He’s the co-owner of the Gator Tale, an Irish Pub built on the bank of the Big Cypress River, in Cooter Crossing.)

I have a question to ask regarding the global stats you make available for public each month. Before you stopped making them public back in may of last year, javascript disabled users summed up to 13% of your users.
With the return of the stats in january of this year, this number melted down to a mere 5%. I was wondering how this drop could be interpreted. Since there hasn't been any significant changes in the browser industry (other than the evolution of gecko based browsers) and no technological break-throughs for Javascript suppport in alternative browsing technologies such as screen readers, palm pilots or cell phones, I was thinking maybe it was how you counted them that may have changed.
Thank you for clarifying this. This information is also crucial to me in terms of evangelisation of accessibility principles.
Denis, we are now only posting global stats for our paid premium users. In May of 2003, we announced we would no longer be able to support free counter accounts after 8/4/03. Since we were not posting to that area for some time, the numbers have now been adjusted to only include the paid premium users.

One of the notable features of the national accounts in recent quarters has been the continued stagnation of compensation of employees.
Compensation of employees reached a peak of €21 billion per quarter at the end of 2008 but since the start of 2010 it has hovered within a few hundred million of €17.7 billion, apart from Q4 2013 when it was €18.7 billion from which it quickly fell away. The most recent data is for Q2 2015 when it was €18.1 billion.
The pattern of compensation of employees seems to run counter to other indicators in the economy. From the QNHS we know that employment is growing, the ELC shows that average weekly earnings are rising and the Exchequer Returns show rising receipts from Income Tax.
The following chart shows indices of total employment and compensation of employees with both set to 100 when employment bottomed out in early 2012. To smooth out some of the volatility four-quarter moving averages are used.
The divergence during 2014 is evident. The final chart shows the source sectors for compensation of employees which, in line with the fist chart above, shows very little happening in recent years.
Most employment is now class A, and for the majority of employees their employer pays PRSI at a rate of 10.75%. A few are on a lower rate of 8.5%, and it is only slightly progressive. There is essentially no way to legitimately avoid PRSI on labour income the way you can with income tax (reliefs, etc). So the employers' PRSI take should move VERY CLOSELY in line with total employee labour income in the economy.
So between 2012 and 2014 employers' PRSI increased by 15 per cent, but the CSO series on compensation of employees is essentially flat. Employers' PRSI is actual cash paid every week by tens of thousands of employers on the basis of what they are paying their staff. The CSO series is model-based, subject to revision and is to my knowledge ultimately based on business survey data.

An introduction to U.S. macroeconomic policy issues, such as how we use monetary and fiscal policies to promote economic growth, low unemployment, and low inflation.
In the November 5, 2009 article "Productivity surge signals job growth to follow," Lucia Mutikani reports that recent increases in U.S. productivity may signal that businesses are ready to hire additional workers.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) – U.S. business productivity grew at its fastest clip in six years in the third quarter and new claims for jobless aid fell to a 10-month low last week, suggesting the labor market may be starting to bottom out.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that productivity surged at a 9.5 percent annual rate, the quickest pace since the third quarter of 2003, as companies squeezed more output from a smaller pool of labor to hold the line on costs.
The Labor Department also reported that initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped to 512,000 in the week ended October 31, the lowest level since early January. Markets had expected a decline to only 523,000, from the 530,000 reported in the prior week.
Some healing of the labor market is crucial to sustaining and strengthening the economy's recovery after its worst recession in 70 years, with employment key to underpinning consumer spending.
Analysts doubt that the rapid growth rate in productivity, which measures the hourly output per worker, can be sustained, which some analysts say means businesses may soon have to step up hiring to meet the demand for their goods and services.
"We expect the pace of efficiency gains will soon begin to fade," said Michelle Girard, a senior economist at RBS in Greenwich, Connecticut. "Having cut payrolls so dramatically during the last downturn, we believe that companies will be forced to add workers earlier in this recovery than was the case following the last two recessions."
U.S. stocks rallied on the data, driving up the three main indexes more than 1 percent higher in morning trade.
Financial markets had expected productivity to rise at a 6.4 percent rate. It grew at a 6.9 percent pace in the April-June period, when the economy was still contracting.
The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday held overnight interest rates close to zero percent and said it would keep them extraordinarily low as long as excess economic slack and a lack of inflation warning signs prevailed.
The U.S. economy grew in the third quarter for the first time in more than a year, driven largely by government stimulus.
Unit labor costs, a measure of the cost of labor for any given amount of production, fell 5.2 percent last quarter after declining 6.1 percent the previous period. Analysts had forecast a drop of only 4 percent.
"Heightened productivity, the shrinkage of unit labor costs improves prospects for hiring over the near term. It points toward wider profit margins, faster earnings growth and more hiring activity," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service in New York.
Productivity in manufacturing rose at a record 13.6 percent rate in the third quarter, likely driven by automakers ramping up production to rebuild depleted stocks after the popular "cash for clunkers" program boosted sales.
Compensation per hour jumped at a 3.8 percent pace, but after adjustment for inflation it was up only 0.2 percent -- pointing to sluggish growth in incomes.
In the weekly jobs claims report, the four-week moving average for new benefit claims slipped 3,000 to 523,750 last week, the lowest in almost 10 months. The average, which is seen as a better gauge of underlying trends, has declined for nine straight weeks.
Still, claims remain high. Analysts say they need to drop below 400,000 to signal that the economy is creating jobs.
U.S. employers have cut 7.2 million workers from their payrolls since the economy fell into recession in December 2007, but the pace of job cuts has been easing.
While the Labor Department is expected to report on Friday that the decline in employment slowed further in October, the jobless rate is expected to rise to 9.9 percent, up from a 26-year high of 9.8 percent in September.
There were further hints of labor market improvement in the data on Thursday. The number of people still on the jobless benefit rolls after collecting an initial week of aid dropped to the lowest level since March in the week ended October 24, the latest week for which data was available.
"The falling number of people on state unemployment insurance programs implies that the unemployment rate is probably approaching its peak. We look for the unemployment rate to peak around 10.2 percent in early 2010," said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at JP Morgan in New York.
My alarm clock is set to NPR. When I heard 9% this morning, I shot up in bed and asked my wife: "Did they just say 9%?" Of course, she found it humorous that labor data could rouse me from the deepest of sleeps like that, but 9% is quite significant.
The real question: Has the turnip dried of blood? Or are we just seeing our productivity put to new limits in our age of exponentially increasing technology?
A large part of me still fears that we've got another job-less recovery on our hands, but the full-time-employment-seeking part of me likes this report and will ponder its hopeful message over a bowl of ramen.
Companies will pay new hires less than current employees even if they have the same level of skill and experence..

I believe it is extremely important to consider the sources of information. No one should be surprised if news reports on MSNBC have a liberal slant or if Fox News has a conservative bias. Unfortunately, far too many people only seek information that supports existing opinions and they fail to consider all sides of issues. I strongly encourage everyone to seek a broad spectrum of opinions and information sources, carefully consider them all, and then reach one’s own conclusions rather than just parroting what a favorite cable news celebrity might say.
The following information is provided to help you understand the biases that may be inherent in this blog. My primary U.S. economic policy concern is the fiscal irresponsibility of government. The Baby Boom generation, which I am part of, has spent the past 30 years accumulating massive public debt that will be passed to our children, grandchildren, and subsequent generations. I am not opposed to the reduction or elimination of any government spending program. Yet, politicians tend to call for reduced spending in general terms and fail to publicly declare specific cuts they would make. The primary cause of the massive U.S. public debt is revenue reductions (in the form of tax cuts) without similar decreases in government spending.
I am willing to consider the expansion and addition of government programs as well. I do not mind how much or little the government provides to society as long as it is paid for. I am willing to pay higher taxes for services deemed worthy, whether they be national defense, homeland security, or income assistance to those less fortunate than I. And I am certainly willing to pay less in taxes or to deposit any government check I receive. My generation, the Baby Boomers, has been very good at cutting taxes and increasing the size of government, regardless of which political party is in power. This is a prescription for financial chaos that remains a horrible legacy for future generations.
I am a professor of economics at Jacksonville University, where I teach courses in introductory economics, comparative economic development, and globalization. I use this blog to keep in touch with my current and former students. Teachers and students at other schools, as well as others interested in economic issues, are welcome to use this resource.
Values are standards and principals by which we live our lives. These standards are many and often depend on people`s background e.g. Culture, class, religion, gender, age. Values are extremely individual attitudes that direct people`s responses to the world around them. Amongst some of the values I live my life by and respect are privacy allowing me to have space to myself and respecting the fact that others may desire privacy, to be safe and also allowing others the same,...

What is social policy? Social Policy Social Policy refers to the development of welfare, social administration and policies of the government used for social protection. Social policy is related to the governmental approach of development of social services towards formation of a welfare state (Alcock, 2003). British welfare state is associated with 'poor laws' established to cater to the needs of the poor. Social policy is not just a mere academic subject but relates to social and economic...

Definition The issue of lone parenting is quite clearly one that is of significant importance and impact in the modern social context.

One of the most controversial political issues of today is that of illegal immigrants from Mexico. Illegal immigration into the United States is a problem that should be stopped, as it is unfair to both Americans and to the people of the country from which they illegally immigrated.

Roy Beck clarifies the situation by stating, "The national consensus is that the United States should be a post-mass...

Project Blyth, part of the Greenpower Education Trust initiative, sees young people building and racing their own electric cars. Since all the cars have the same power source, the difference between winning and losing is dependent on making improvements to the car’s design and driving style.
As part of Connected Hull, we worked with Francis Askew Primary School to investigate collecting data on the forces that were exerted on a car as it raced.
They mounted a 3-axis accelerometer on their race car and used it to measure acceleration. The data was collected with a Raspberry Pi with a LoRaWAN interface, which enabled it to transmit the data, and a sensor board. It was powered by a USB battery pack.
From this we were able to see some oscillations present, and at which points acceleration dropped. Analysing the results the team concluded that, in theory, the car was capable of reaching a higher top speed and reaching that speed faster.
It’s important to remember that these projects are about learning experiences for everyone; unfortunately the sensor was able to move so we couldn’t break down the data to determine the cause of the oscillating forces on race day. However, the collaboration demonstrated the potential of improving race performance as a result of collecting data to inform decision making.
How does the the team intend to secure pole position in future years? They already have plans and ideas about using data and sensors as part of their future builds.

Many borrowers are looking for cheap loans, but how is a cheap loan defined? For starters a person has to remember that nothing is free and loans cost money. Loans are paid for through interest rates and fees. Lenders are in the business of trying to make as much money off the loan process as possible. It is up to the borrower to make sure they get a cheap loan because the lender is not going to worry about making it that way for the borrower. Lenders earn their money off loans through the interest rates they charge and the fees associated with the loan. Borrowers are responsible for watching out for these costs. Interest rates are often the most talked about charge. That is because interest can really tack on a large chunk of money to the cost of a loan. Big ticket items can cost a borrower more than the actual loan amount. In the end the borrower will have paid double, sometimes triple, the actual loan amount in interest rates alone. This is why getting a low interest rate is so important in getting a cheap loan. The trick to getting a low interest rate is shopping around. The interest rate is going to be based on a few things. It will be based on what the current interest rates are and on the borrowers credit history. The borrower really has no way to control the current average interest rate, but they can improve their credit to help lower rates. Додатково, the borrower can shop around until they find the lowest interest rate lenders will extend to them. This is helpful even for a borrower with less than perfect credit. By shopping around a borrower is taking control of the situation and therefore has more of a chance of securing a cheap loan. Fees are another way lenders make their money. Many lenders include all types of fees in a loan agreement. If a borrower does not read the terms and conditions of the loan carefully they will likely end up with hidden fees that will cost them in the end. Some common fees include processing fees, like application fees, and early pay off penalties. Processing fees are often included and justified as paying for the time of the person who processes the loan. It is just another way to get more money from borrowers and is not really a necessity. Early pay off penalties are common place in the loan world. These penalties are the lenders way of protecting themselves form losing too much money. What this penalty does is costs the borrower should they pay off the loan early then the specified date in the contract. Usually these penalties are only enforced if the loan is paid off in the first two years, for long term loans. Anything over two years is not worth agreeing to. Getting a cheap loan is really in the hands of the borrower. It is the borrower who must be diligent in reading the terms and conditions and shopping around. The borrower is the only one who will benefit from cheap loans, so they have to be the one to make sure they are getting a cheap loan.

The plan: Leave the Scoop at 10 AM. It will end at my house. Where I"ll have beer and bourbon and maybe some food.
But Glen is hosting the ride. And if you've not seen Glen since the last BFF ride, then you're in for a surprise.
Check him out. Holy hell there's a dude that's killing it lately. Unless you follow CX stuff closely, you'd never know that he came in 2nd in the State CX Championship, Geezer Class, a couple weekends ago. I like to say "Geezer Class" because it's funny, but more precisely, it's Masters 50 Men's. That's a competitive pile of dudes. He won by being fast, but also by being Glen smart. It's a good story. He's promised to tell it during post-BFF drinks.
Also: if you are worried about keeping up with Glen on the BFF ride, you should. But he's handicapping himself by riding the Pugsley and hauling a saw. And if, you don't want to go on the BFF ride but you still want to hang for the bourbon beer part, you can do that too.
Also, while we're on the topic of tooting Glen's horn -- go buy the latest issue of Bicycle Quarterly. You'll note that the NFE is on the cover. Jan gives it a good review too. The NFE stock project is going gang busters already. I'm thinking this review will make it more gang bustery.
Anyway: go on the BFF ride for those of us that can't. It's always one of my favorite rides every year. Traditionally, it's a ride that I like to do with a CX bike, but this year I was planning on taking my mountain bike. Fat bike works too.

When it comes to beauty, there’s only one statement I make and it’s my signature bold lip. Wearing a strong lip colour is something I undeniably inherited from my stylish mother, and truly believe that a good lipstick is the answer to a lot of life’s problems. As such a lipstick aficionado, I couldn’t be more excited to team up with my friends at Lise Watier and Shoppers Drug Mart to join in on their #MyKissStory campaign, and help tell YOU about your chance to WIN one of 374 super glam Lise Watier retro makeup stations filled with 5 of their best selling products and valued at a whopping total of $593 CAD!

In this version of #MyKissStory, the lipsticks featured are Red Hot Kiss, Tango Kiss, Wild Kiss and the Ecarlate and Vino lipliners all by Lise Watier.
Flowers and chocolates are nice, but all I ever really want on Valentine’s Day is a big, juicy, romantic kiss! Time just stops still when you get to kiss the one you love most on the day of love, don’t you think? On the day of love, my pucker picks include the Flamingo Kiss and Candy Kiss lipsticks and Coraline lip liner all by Lise Watier.
Some of my best and wildest memories are from travelling abroad with friends. When you’re young, wild and free, you never know what’s going to happen – and sometimes that means getting to kiss a friendly stranger in a new city! The lipsticks I pack when I’m travelling are the Bubbly Kiss and Fancy Kiss by Lise Watier, naturally.
Now that my wild child phase has calmed down, and I’m happily settled in a beautiful home with my wonderful boyfriend, my favourite kiss (that I get to indulge in daily!) is definitely the ever so sweet kiss at home. From first thing in the morning, to when I walk through the door in the evening, it’s always what I look forward to most in a day. For a cozy kiss at home I wear the Natural Kiss and First Kiss lipsticks and Suede Lip Liner by Lise Watier.

Welcome to Call of Duty®: Ghosts, an extraordinary step forward for one of the largest entertainment franchises of all-time. This new chapter in the Call of Duty® franchise features a fresh dynamic where players are on the side of a crippled nation fighting not for freedom, or liberty, but simply to survive. Ten years after a devastating mass event, the nation's borders and the balance of global power have been redrawn forever. A superpower no more, its economy and government in ashes, the country's once-mighty military struggles to stave off complete collapse. As what's left of the nation's Special Operations forces, a mysterious group known only as "Ghosts" leads the fight back against a newly emerged, technologically-superior global power. Fueling this boldly reimagined Call of Duty® universe, the franchise's ambitious new next-gen engine delivers stunning levels of immersion and performance all while maintaining the speed and fluidity of 60 frames-per-second across all platforms. Key Features: The Introduction of a New Next-Gen Engine: Call of Duty®'s new next-gen engine ushers in an unprecedented level of innovation, delivering stunning and lifelike characters, gorgeously rendered environments, and authentic real-world animations, all brought to life by advanced lighting systems and visual effects that redefine forever the signature standards Call of Duty® fans have come to expect from the critically-acclaimed series. A New Call of Duty® Universe: For the first time in franchise history, players will take on the underdog role with Call of Duty®: Ghosts; outnumbered and outgunned, players must fight to reclaim a fallen nation in an intensely personal narrative. Gamers will get to know an entirely new cast of characters and locales in a world unlike any that Call of Duty® has explored before. The Next Generation of Multiplayer: Armed with a new next gen engine, Call of Duty®: Ghosts redefines the franchise's hallmark multiplayer experience. Dynamic maps bring earthquakes, floods, and user-initiated events that fundamentally alter the flow and strategy of every fight. Also, with unparalleled character customization, players have total control to tailor-make their soldier. These are just two of the many innovations going into the Call of Duty®: Ghosts multiplayer experience.

It's a Saturday night in London, the hippest city on earth. Quant and Hawk, the young couple at the centre of More is Less, both agree on one thing - they want to go out. The only trouble is, that's all they agree on. Where to go? What to do? There's just so many choices, so many possible great-night-outs. A seemingly endless world of theatres, movies, gigs, raves and parties await them both, but they're just unable to pick.

The perishables trade between China and Peru has a long history of cultural exchange dating back to the 19th century. And this trade is expected to increase in line with China’s growing appetite for fresh produce.

I had been toying with the idea of buying a new daily driver, since my bright idea to daily driver a Lamborghini was not turning out the way I had planned. The rumors slowly became facts, and the car hit many of the things I was looking for. It was fast (I can track it!), it had all wheel drive (for the Seattle rain), it had four doors (great for hauling my pug around), and most importantly it was going to be cheap enough that I could justify giving away our other car to my wife’s parents, who desperately needed a new vehicle.
In September 2015, before the order books were open, I began searching for a dealer who actually had an allotment. I had heard stories of people who ‘ordered’ other high demand cars such as GT350s only to find out, months later, that their dealer in fact was never going to receive one. Luckily, a friend of mine knew the General Manager of a Ford dealer located 4 hours away who not only had a single allotment, they would sell it to me for MSRP! I want to stress that this dealership has been GREAT through this whole process. They are also victims in Ford Corporate’s horrible bungling of the situation and I’m sure they want nothing more than to get my car to me.
The order books officially opened on October 12th of 2015 and I placed one of the very first orders for a fully loaded Nitrous Blue Focus RS. My dealer commented how, due to how fast we placed it, this could be one of the first 5 delivered on the West Coast. We tentatively thought it could arrive as soon as January, but I wasn’t going to hold my breath.
January came and went with no car. This wasn’t a huge surprise to me as they had just started building them. My dealer kept insisting my car should enter ‘Production’ status any day now, so I still kept tabs every couple of weeks. In February is where things started to go wrong. The factory was shut down for 3 weeks to fix something on all the cars produced to that date, and to change the tooling to prevent whatever issue was plaguing them from happening any more. Ford never officially communicated on this, but rumors were that it had something to do with the Rear Drive Unit (RDU) on the car. The RDU unit was brand new, cutting edge technology so some hiccups were to be expected.
Cars were being built, but mine was nowhere in sight. We obviously weren’t going to be one of the first 5 on the West Coast, but I was sure I’d get my car in due time. The only problem was this — Ford wasn’t giving anyone any information. The production process was and still is a complete mystery. As of this writing, there are people that ordered the same day as me (October 12th) whose cars have STILL NOT BEEN PRODUCED.
The savior of both myself and everyone else on the Focus forums were two anonymous Ford employees who, in their spare time, were secretly giving us information of our cars. It was through these two heroes that I was told the day my car started production — March 13th. My car’s production was halted at one point (as were others) to fix yet another issue, but it was ready to be shipped out in April. Along with a couple hundred other cars, it was loaded onto the Grand Legacy late April and made way for Newark, New Jersey. The Focus forums had a lot of fun as we all tracked the ship in real time — and one fan even snuck on to the boat to take pictures once it docked!
Users tracked the Grand Legacy in realtimeSomeone even snuck on the boat. My car is somewhere in there!
And this is where the fun stops. Ford found out about the employees on the forum and told them to cease all information exchange. My car was unloaded in Newark, New Jersey on May 6th and that is the last time I’ve heard anything. Seriously. It has now been 10 weeks since my car has been unloaded and I don’t have it. I don’t know what it’s doing at the docks. Ford won’t tell me. I don’t know when it will be delivered. Ford won’t tell me. Ford told all RS owners to start contacting Ford Service on Facebook (seriously), who are outsourced customer support who read off scripts.
And that’s where we are today. My dealer can’t get any information — literally. His calls to Ford Corporate go unanswered. I tried emailing up the chain and received this absolute gem of an email from their crack support team:
I tried contacting them on Twitter. On Facebook. I even e-mailed Mark Fields, the CEO. I thought that was going to get the ball rolling as I received an email response from a real human, but it’s been 3 weeks and my car is still missing. I’ve offered to fly in and pick the car up, they won’t allow that. They can’t even give me an ETA. I had registered for the Virginia City Hillclimb after the car docked in May, figuring 5 months was plenty of time, and now it looks like I’m going to miss it.
What’s even worse is I’m not even the worst off. As I previously mentioned, there are people who ordered the same day I did who don’t even have production dates yet. I’m hoping Ford sees this and begins to fix their atrocious customer support system, and actually gives information to consumers. It’s insane that in today’s Same Day Delivery world, we can’t track something as major as a car.
To end on a funny note, there was someone in my position who got tired of waiting. In the time his car has been sitting in purgatory in Newark he went out, ordered a new STI, they built it, shipped it to him, and he took delivery before his car made it out of Newark. Maybe I should do that instead.
Buying a car for someone else is a good idea if you are financially able to do so and the person is in need of dependable transportation. Owning a car is a big responsibility. In addition to you figuring out if the person is responsible enough to own a car, you must take other things, such as maintenance and insurance, into consideration when you buy a car for someone else.

Rental cars have a reputation for being abused, which makes some people wary of buying one. However, the reputation is exaggerated, and rental car sales are in fact a legitimate and growing business. Rental cars do have abusive drivers on occasion, but they are well-maintained by the rental company and usually retired after less than two years of service. They are then inspected before being offered for sale. They also come with pretty good warranties, so far as used-car warranties go. If you're in the market for a new car, consider buying a rental.

Roodepoort Cash For Vehicles blame it on the increasing price tags of brand new cars or the brutal depreciation hit in the initial years; more and more potential buyers are having second thoughts about buying new cars for sale. Even though purchasing sacardeals.co.za used cars for sale offer a varied array of benefits, it is always a gamble of your luck. And with the increasing incidents of dealership scams or marketing ploys, it is easy to fall into a lemon trap. Want to save yourself from the buyer’s remorse; then you should arm yourself with all the right information and tactics to find the best deal in the second-hand auto sales market. Below listed are some essential tips you need to follow before buying used cars for sale.
As a designated Car Friend, people often ask me: Hey, James. Should I pick up a reasonably-priced used car and drive to the beach and sometimes suburban grocery stores? The answer to this question, of course, is yes, but that answer invites a much lengthier interrogation: What cars should I look at? What’s a good budget? Are private sellers trustworthy? In the spirit of that discussion, what follows is a comprehensive guide to buying cars for people who live somewhere that ensures they don’t really need a car, but maybe it’s nice to have.
It’s a good era to be shopping for used cars. Assuming you don’t rely on your car for daily transportation, it’s possible to get a perfectly decent vehicle for a small investment. Modern autos last far longer than whips of previous generations, and even a car fifteen years old in 2016 ought to feature a solid slate of creature comforts and safety features: power windows, AC, airbags, ABS, etc. The slings and arrows of depreciation ensure that used cars of a certain era trade hands at perhaps 10 or 20 percent of their cost new. What’s more, a savvy motorist can drive one of these used cars for several years, maintain it a bit, then sell it at nearly the same price. There’s a baseline where depreciation slows to a crawl.
You ought to plan on laying out at least $2,500 for a reliable set of wheels. It’s unlikely an example much under that price point will have many years of life left in it. Outliers exist, of course, but the risk somewhat overshadows the reward. On the other end of the spectrum, the once-a-week driver probably doesn’t need to spend more than $5,000. Between those points is the sweet spot for value and reliability.
Japanese manufacturers tend to produce the most reliable cars. In the used-car bargain bin, Hondas and Toyotas are the longest lived, and also hold their value a bit better than the competition. Lexuses and Acuras are often perfectly affordable — these are just Toyotas and Hondas by another name. Nissans and Subarus are safe bets, too. Older cars from European makes are hit or miss. Plenty of folks drive their BMWs and Mercedes into the ground without experiencing a major repair bill, but frequent maintenance is critical for more complex, luxurious cars. An aging sports sedan with power seats, air-adjusted suspension and dual climate zones has a lot more components capable of breaking down. Low-end Euros aren’t safe either: elderly VWs in particular should be banished from your search.
American cars tend to be the least expensive on the lot, for good reason. There are certain models from Ford, Chevrolet, Dodge, and their sibling brands that are screwed together well (particularly trucks) but many of these products are real duds. Avoid anything that looks like it belongs at a rental counter in LAX circa 2005.
For a consumer in the market for a “regular” car, boring old sedans and compact cars deliver the best value. Trucks, sports cars, Jeeps, etc., are valued by enthusiast communities and command a premium compared to more sedate transportation.
Cliché, but true: the best marketplace to seek a used car is the same venue you used to sell your couch and find a Pokemon trainer: Craigslist. Certain regions have good local-paper classifieds, too, but Craigslist — temple of retro web design — always delivers.
Lots of people fear buying a used car from a private seller, but I prefer to do business with an individual. Dealers don’t know much about the history of their inventory, while a private seller can share the life story of their car. Private sellers are by and large honest, if occasionally less informed than automotive experts. Used car dealers specializing in the cheapest cars, by contrast, are often true bottom-feeders — the fount from which car sales stereotypes emerged. There are reputable used car outlets, but be on guard for a fly-by-night operation.
In evaluating ads, you’re looking for two things: maintenance history and plenty of clear photos. The more photos, the more likely the car is in good condition. Cars that invite close inspection should be advertised with shots taken from a variety of angles, showing the inside and under the hood. Check that doors all sit level, and that the color of each panel matches exactly — uneven body fit or paint can indicate a prior wreck. Look closely for signs of rust. Rust is the worst, usually a terminal condition, and especially a concern when shopping in the snowy, salty states of the northeast or Midwest.
The more maintenance an owner can demonstrate they’ve performed, the longer their car is likely to last, and the less money you’ll have to put into it. Ask about wear items that need to be regularly replaced: tires, brakes, battery. The longer a car has been with a seller, the more likely it’s been well looked-after. Mileage isn’t an urgent concern — it’s better to buy a thoroughly maintained car with higher miles than a low-mile example suffering from neglect.
Be aware there are certain big-ticket services all cars require as they age. Every 90k miles or so, most cars need to their timing belt and water pump replaced. This can be a costly pit stop, and skipping it is not wise. Cars over 100,000 miles often, but not always, require new exhausts, shocks, wheel bearing or axles — it’s a good sign if these repairs were repaired by the previous owner. If you happen to be shopping for a car with a manual transmission, the typical lifespan of a clutch is 100–150k, so the cost of a replacement should be factored into the purchase of a car that has traveled that range on its original equipment.
So, you found a promising lead and it’s time for an-person inspection. Ask the seller if they can avoid starting the car before your visit. Certain ailments are more noticeable on a cold start, so unscrupulous car dealers sometimes take the liberty of warming their goods up. When you get out to see the car, before you turn it on, conduct a walk-around. Do the panels fit tight?
Is the paint color consistent all around? Is there any rust in the lower edges of the body. The tires should all match and show good depth. Make sure all the lights and signals work, then check that the engine is full of fluids: oil, coolant, power steering and transmission fluid. [note: definitely do NOT check coolant level on a hot engine!] While you’re under the hood, peep the sheet metal around the engine: does it look straight and original? Poke your head under the car and see if it appears to be leaving any puddles of oil or coolant from a fresh leak. If there’s water under the car and the AC was just running, don’t fret! That’s normal.
Assuming you made it this far, it’s time for a drive. Start the car up, listening for untoward noises like squealing belts or a rattling exhaust. Did the check engine light illuminate when the key was in “on” and go away after the engine was started? Test all the accessories: windows, AC, wipers, etc, and hit the open road. Leave the windows down to better hear any potential mechanical issues.
Once you’re on the open road, see how the car responds to changes in speed and RPMs. Does the engine sound smooth or does it stumble? Are gear shifts firm and quick? Are bumps absorbed with aplomb, or does the car feel like it’s too low or too bouncy? On a straight, flat, safe section of road, release the wheel and check that the car drives straight. Push the brakes: do they cause the car to pull to one side?
Once you’re satisfied your potential purchase drives the way it should, it’s time to make an offer and do some paperwork.
Uncomfortable as it may be to haggle, negotiations are a fact of life in the used car game. Dealers and private sellers both set their asking price in anticipation of being knocked around a little bit. The typical wiggle room in a used car price is around 10 percent, but don’t let that stop you from bargaining your way to an even better price reduction.
Before you seal the deal, tell the seller that you’re ready to buy, but you’re concerned the asking price is just too high. Often, a seller will do some negotiating on your behalf, and throw out a slightly lower number. Whatever the response to your initial entreaty, don’t accept the quoted figure immediately. Instead, suggest a price twenty-five percent under the most recent offer. That’s an amount close enough to ask to demonstrate you’re serious, and it’s further than halfway under the typical negotiations (ten percent), stacking the deck slightly in your favor. There may be a little back and forth from here out, but stick to your guns. It’s very, very rare to meet a seller with no willingness to deal.
I prefer to bring my used car purchases home immediately after negotiations. I head to the bank and withdraw the full amount (this probably means a visit to a live teller, not the ATM) and fill out the paperwork with the seller on the spot. The seller needs to sign over the title (check that it is “clean,” i.e., not salvage or repair branded), and provide a signature on a bill of sale. The BOS is not a complicated document. In nearly any state, the DMV will accept a handwritten agreement that lists the car’s selling price, Vehicle Identification Number and the names and addresses of the buyer and seller. A couple oddball states like Pennsylvania require this documentation to be notarized—a quick visit to Google should clear up the rules in your state.
If you don’t plan to bring the car home the day you viewed it, leave a deposit (10 percent of the sale price, or $500, whichever is less) and write up an agreement to provide the remainder.
One final hurdle in the transaction process: physically getting the car home. Odds are that on the day of your purchase, you are not equipped with valid registration and license plates for the new car. The easiest solution: drive it home with the old license plates still on the car (they’re valid until the previous owner cancels the registration) and mail the plates back to the seller. If the previous owner balks at this plan, you could ask her to drive the car herself to your home, and then offer to ferry her back. If these options are both off the table, you’ll need to leave the car with the seller and head to the DMV to secure registration. After getting license plates at the DMV, you can return to the seller and drive off into the sunset 100 percent legit.
For most people, buying a used car is a rare occasion indeed, and it’s easy to feel intimidated by the process. Don’t sweat it. There are lots of great used cars out there, and a little bit of research and preparation will go a long way toward a successful purchase. You’re going to do great!
Buying a used car presents a difficult choice.

Buying a used car makes a lot of sense for buyers around the world for various reasons. They are relatively cheaper than the new ones and do not depreciate very quickly. There are multiple things to reflect on before purchasing a used car, which briefly includes your budget combined with the specs you want in your vehicle. Let us have a look on top 7 best used cars to buy in 2017.
How did we sell cars before the Internet? Newspapers and word of mouth, that’s how. Can you imagine anything more labor intensive? But then science discovered the Internet, and with it Craigslist, and BAM! People had an easy way to clear out their garages.
Craigslist KC — Kansas City or commonly known as K.C is the largest city in the United States, So people are struggling to sell/buy things via online. There is one most popular classified site that helps people to sell/buy things via online. It’s Craigslist
Last year, a few of us at Hagerty bought some inexpensive modern classics for a video shoot — a 1985 Mazda RX-7, a 1975 Chevy El Camino and a 1972 VW Beetle. Once the shoot was wrapped, we soon discovered that we had to do something with the cars. Instead of selling them, like we should have done, we found a nice warm garage, parked them, and let them appreciate. Now they are worth tens of dollars more than they were a year ago, and the time has come to pass them along to the next stewards.
With three cars to sell and the vast power of science’s Craigslist on which to sell them, we decided to vary our approach with each car, much the way you see varied sales approaches on Craigslist itself. Generally, people try to offload their old cars in one of three ways:
From an “I don’t care about this car enough to give it more than seven words of description” standpoint.
Based purely on the amount of effort we felt each car deserved, we assigned them each their own strategy.
And the Beetle, well, it’s a Beetle, everybody knows what it is, and what more is there to say, really?
All three cars were priced roughly the same, which is to say the $3,000–$4,000 entry-level collectible range. And each was photographed appropriately, though in the case of the Beetle, that simply means a couple blurry, partially obscured shots. The only thing left to do, then, is to sit back and see which approach garners the most interest. And whether we can actually sell these things….
Likewise we can also buy/sell/find Craigslist kc cars, Craigslist kc personals, craigslist kc motorcycles, craigslist kc boats, craigslist Kansas city furniture, craigslist kc electronics, craigslist kc tickets, craigslist kc rvs and more too.

The keyboard is mightier than the machine gun... The political, philosophical and general outpourings of a troubled soul living in Australia and blogging his Vietnam veteran's head off.
Nothing in this blog can be believed. If you think that anything in this blog is true or factual, you'll need to verify it from another source. Do you understand? No? Then read it again, and repeat this process, until you understand that you cannot sue me for anything you read here. Also, having been sucked into taking part in the mass-murder of more than 3 million Vietnamese people on behalf of U.S. Big Business "interests", I'm as mad as a cut snake (and broke) so it might be a bit silly to try to sue me anyway...
Greensmile has hit the nail right on the head. I'm not sleeping much lately. My head's full of shit but I haven't been in a blogging mood as you can tell. I don't really want to infect readers with my depressing rantings. But I will share a few things.
I'm almost a total recluse now. Except for my poor suffering partner (bless her soul) I go out of my way to have as little contact with people as possible. I can't even bear (no pun intended) emails. They deserve a genuine intimacy which I cannot muster. Also I've had bad experiences with emails. I've lost readers due to them. Seems when I tell it how it really is for me, this is so pathetic, or so confronting, or so offensive, or so whatever, that they end up just not replying, and then they shun this blog. I think I'm a social leper. Is there a colony for social lepers?
Also, I got my nose fully out of joint when a blogger, for whom I have heaps of respect, saw fit to trash me from her blogroll without so much as a "Get fucked, Gerry, you shit me because of blah-blah-blah..."

I find myself talking to myself a lot these days. My most common expression is "Yuze can all get fucked!" I've even muttered this out loud (unwittingly) whilst skulking around the local shopping centre.
Physically things haven't been great either. I had weeks of severe lower back pain which has now "settled down" into agonising sciatica.
Ron, I hope I didn't offend you with my latest comment on your blog. It was meant to be funny and witty but I no longer know if that's how I'm perceived "out there", and I cannot trust my own judgement it seems...
you're doomed. I'm doomed. We are all doomed. Its the lucky ones who get to go to the doom store and pick out the flavor of doom that will transition them back to the infinite oblivion they came from. Lucky because they don't know any better.
They label all the dooms at the doom store with high sounding names. They got Valhalah Vanilla, Heavenly Hash, Hellishly Hot Jalapeno, Blaze of Glory Blueberry. Moon reflected in Spring Water is popular with Buddhists. I think you can even get "Consciousness without an object" if you can Merrell-Wolff it down.
And you know what? Only the labels are different. They all taste exactly the same but yer dead so you don't know. Its the bloody anticipation they are selling you, don't you know? Would you have the balls to charge for a hoax like that?
[glad to see you stirring bearly-a-blogger! Complaining is so delicious and for some unfathomable reason, complaint seems to need little license when one visits the dodgy discourses....now get some sleep!]

No offence even thought about let alone taken, Gerry. I am not really blogging on MM anymore, just do the occasional piece on Larvatus when I need to.
This post of yours could have been written by me except the part about another blogger. I can't remember the last time I slept two hours in a row. I buy a lottery ticket every day: my dream, if I win, is to buy a house in the bush on a hundred forested acres and just go into the local town once a week for food and books. But I'm never going to win 'cause things like that don't happen to people like me.
I just wish I the had the guts to you know what but I can't anyway because I have kids ... maybe nature will do the job for me soon. Anyway the mental and physical pain is just punish because of the things I have done in my life and the people I've hurt - my karma cup runneth over.
Welcome to the back pain club. Rantings from the bear are preferable to silence which makes us worry.
The faithful already know you're nuts but we keep coming back even if it is only to use your blogroll. One day I'll learn how to put up links.
You growl a lot Bear but underneath you're just a fluffy big teddy, fluffy big pink teddy. That ought to trash your rep as a brawler.
GS, I liked your doom thing. I've done a bit of "research" into the beyond, and from what I can make out there is NO judicary sitting in judgemeent "up" there. Just a benign, all-forgiving love emanating from "somehere". Nor is one condemned to hell or oblivion for committing suicide. There's apparently an endless sequence of "lifetimes' until one "gets over" some original (and subsequent) crap which keeps hurling us back into this cesspit. They even invented eternity for the slow learners... If there IS a hell, it's right here, right now. Of course, my "research" could be flawed...
Ron, for the sake of your loved ones, I hope you don't find the guts to do you know what. Even though I frequently stand on the edge of that abyss myself and I too have been stopped each time by the thought of what it would do to those who love me. Seems that if you love them, you can't do it. Anyway, I doubt they hand out medals for it at the other end....
JayTee, I'm a big bad misogynist denying women their rights doncha know (no, this is not aimed at you - they know who they are). Fucking generalising, man-hating bitches!
if u lived in the UK - i'd tell you to watch Planet Earth on BBC 1 9pm GMT. it'll take your mind of nasty things.
not everyone understands the way you communicate - but the people who do - i guess they're Real gems. ppl i probably wish i could be friends with but wouldn't be cool enough to earn.
it's okay. everyone gets the blues - but the grass is greener where it rains. i would know. i live in the rainiest town in Scotland.
Nora, thanks. I wonder if praying for atheists who frequently backslide into agnosticism is (a) effective, or (b) worth it. But I'll let you know if somethig happens to cheer me up. I promise.
Best post I've ever written? Heh. I thought it was one of my worst. Totally pathetic. "I wouldn't join a club that would have me as a member." (Sorry, Graucho)
Another puzzle: I just checked my Bloglines and since I've been teetering on the edge of blogospheric oblivion, and posting shite, the number of subscibers has jumped from eight to ten. It was steady on eight for about twelf months prior to that. Go figure, those of you who are statistically inclined...
I see from my counter that someone has just visited my blog from yours. If this was you, I hope you found something which cheered you up a bit and that you will drop in again some time.
By the way, don't believe what the Scottish lady told you about Planet Earth: the latest programme in the series featured a huge pile of bat poo containing millions of cockroaches, which is hardly likely to take your mind off nasty things.
Hi Tony. Yeah that was me. I'm still feel like a coal merchant gatecrashing a Royal Ball in his work clothes, everytime I visit your blog. Thanks for your kind wishes, Tony, but I'm so f*cked up I don't think I'll ever find my way out of the hole I'm in. I blame, to a great degree, all of the arseholes who voted for Bush Blair and Howard last time round. I have lost all faith in the democratic process. It is so easily manipulated and subverted. The next person to tell me about the wonders of our "freedom" and "democracy" is likely to wear a bunch of fives.
EVERYONE is f-d in the head. only the cool people admit it instead of pretending they're fine like the rest of the hoard.
What everyone else said. When I read a post such as this I wish there was something I could do. I don't know you but I reckon I know a lot of people like you. We're all a bit f**ked in the head one way or other but only the sensible figure it out for themselves. I like the phrase 'backsliding agnostic' 'cos it indicates (to me, anyeay) a very realistic assessment of 'what's it all about'. I like visiting here 'cos it feels familar. Stay cool.
I am also a lot like that. Doomed, reclusive and in pain, that is. Somehow , there's still plenty of humour though...it does seem familar here.

Storm surges can be extremely destructive. 44% of global human population are located within 150 km of the coast and eight of the ten largest cities in the world are located on the coast. In northern Europe many coastal areas are just above or even below the mean sea level (MSL) and are particularly vulnerable to the persistent threat and impact of storm surges. When a storm surge makes landfall extensive flooding may occur. In more extreme cases the surge may lead to loss of life and significant damage to property with large economic costs. Typical losses include destruction of homes, offices, docks, warehouses and other structures and facilities, loss of power and communication systems, damage to coastal defences, boats in harbours, and washing out of roads, railways and other infrastructure.
Objectives The aim of the Data User Element (DUE) storm Surge Demonstration Service (eSurge) project is to support storm surge systems, their services, engineers and scientists by facilitating the widespread user uptake and application of advanced information products from ESA and other Earth Observation missions. To achieve the eSurge project aim, eSurge will develop, demonstrate and validate the latest advanced techniques for retrieving high-resolution information on Total Water Level Envelope (TWLE), wind speed, and waves in the coastal zone from EO measurements that address storm surge user requirements. Access to other more general EO data products (e.g., SST, microwave wind and wave products, and moderate resolution optical data for coastal inundation mapping) together with weather and ocean numerical forecasting systems and other socio- economic data that characterise both extra-tropical and tropical cyclone storm surge case study events in a number of user defined Areas of Interest. An extensive and open-access of historical and contemporary storm Surge events will be delivered as case studies (with interface tools to access and use eSurge data products). eSurge will also provide a demonstration NRT service of user defined EO data products and eSurge services in support of operational and experimental storm surge forecasting and warning services. As part of this work, the project will implement together with the eSurge user community, a number of re-analysis data assimilation and validation experiments for historical and contemporary storm surge events that demonstrate the impact of EO data on storm surge applications.

3 Abstract In a world that is increasingly relying on digital technologies, the ability to securely communicate and distribute information is of crucial importance. Cryptography plays a key role in this context and the research presented in this thesis focuses on developing cryptographic primitives whose properties address more closely the needs of users. We start by considering the notion of robustness in public-key encryption, a property which models the idea that a ciphertext should not decrypt to a valid message under two different keys. In contexts where anonymity is relevant, robustness is likely to be needed as well, since a user cannot tell from the ciphertext if it is intended for him or not. We develop and study new notions of robustness, relating them to one another and showing how to achieve them. We then consider the important issue of protecting users privacy in broadcast encryption. Broadcast encryption (BE) is a cryptographic primitive designed to efficiently broadcast an encrypted message to a target set of users that can decrypt it. Its extensive real-life application to radio, television and web-casting renders BE an extremely interesting area. However, all the work so far has striven for efficiency, focusing in particular on solutions which achieve short ciphertexts, while very little attention has been given to anonymity. To address this issue, we formally define anonymous broadcast encryption, which guarantees recipient-anonymity, and we provide generic constructions to achieve it from public-key, identity-based and attribute-based encryption. Furthermore, we present techniques to improve the efficiency of our constructions. Finally, we develop a new primitive, called time-specific encryption (TSE), which allows us to include the important element of time in the encryption and decryption processes. In TSE, the sender is able to specify during what time interval a ciphertext can be decrypted by a receiver. This is a relevant property since information may become useless after a certain point, sensitive data may not be released before a particular time, or we may wish to enable access to information for only a limited period. We define security models for various flavours of TSE and provide efficient instantiations for all of them. These results represent our efforts in developing public-key encryption schemes with enhanced properties, whilst maintaining the delicate balance between security and efficiency. 3
6 Chapter 1 Introduction Contents 1.1 A delicate balance Anonymity and time in public-key encryption Organization of the thesis A delicate balance Claude Shannon s famous paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems [83] can be regarded as the pivotal work which transformed cryptography from an almost recreational brain-teasing activity to the official science of secrets [88]. It was in [83], in fact, that the bases of the theory of cryptography were set and that a first rigorous mathematical proof of the perfect secrecy of the Vernam cipher (also known as the one-time pad) was given. One of the original goals of cryptography can be considered that of enabling secure communication. Therefore, having designed a perfectly secure cipher could seem to have already solved this problem. On the other hand, we know that research in this area has rapidly evolved since this result and it is still progressing at a very high pace. So, what is the catch? It is well-known that, however secure the one-time pad is, it suffers from severe practical limitations. Indeed, the secret key to encrypt can be used only once and it has to be as long as the message, raising the fundamental real-world issue of key-management. The realization of the need of practicality in the design of cryptosystems characterizes the advances of the cryptographic research community, which has tried to find the delicate balance between security and efficiency ever since. 6
7 1.2 Anonymity and time in public-key encryption One may ask why efficiency is actually needed. Why isn t the mere intellectual satisfaction of achieving a perfectly secure way of communicating enough? A simple answer to these questions is because cryptography is used. In a world that is increasingly relying on digital technologies cryptography has become part of our daily life. Mobile phone communications, credit card payments, web browsing are only a few examples of cryptographically enabled operations that are widely used today. One does not have to look too far to see many more: e-voting, e-commerce, on-line banking, distribution of digital copyright media are further examples of this. Given the widespread use of cryptography in a variety of applications, it is fairly natural that the related research has focused on developing systems capable of providing the required security guarantees whilst maintaining acceptable levels of practicality for real-life deployment. One could regard this quest as being the leitmotif behind the progress of cryptography through the years. In this respect, we view the results in this thesis as making a contribution to the theme of designing cryptographic schemes delicately balanced between security and efficiency. 1.2 Anonymity and time in public-key encryption The title of this thesis, Anonymity and time in public-key encryption, identifies the core features of our work. We are going to design and construct several encryption schemes in the public-key setting satisfying enhanced security properties. In particular, we consider the important property of anonymity, the related notion of robustness, and the ability to include the element of time in the encryption process. Public-key encryption. Since its revolutionary introduction in 1976 [42], publickey cryptography has developed greatly, and by now it represents a fundamental area of cryptography. In particular, public-key encryption (PKE) has received a lot of research attention. Indeed the cryptographic community has obtained numerous results, by achieving various levels of security in the proposed schemes, by continuously improving on the efficiency of the constructions, and by developing a variety of additional functionalities. We recall the basic notions for PKE relevant to our work in Chapter 2. However, since an exhaustive and detailed presentation of PKE is beyond the scope of this thesis, we refer the interested reader to [57]. 7
8 1.2 Anonymity and time in public-key encryption The importance of anonymity. Addressing the issue of protecting users privacy is of crucial importance. This is reflected by the great attention given to anonymity in all the main fields of modern cryptography. In the area of PKE, anonymity is often referred to as key-privacy [8]. This notion captures the property that an eavesdropper is not able to tell under which one of several public keys a ciphertext was created. The analogous concept in the identity-based setting was studied in [1, 23]. The benefit of preserving receivers privacy is relevant in more elaborate systems involving for example hierarchical identity-based encryption (HIBE) [22], attributebased encryption (ABE) or predicate encryption [58], where achieving anonymity guarantees becomes increasingly challenging. Furthermore, in the context of digital signatures, a number of primitives effectively rely on anonymity group signatures [30], anonymous credentials [29] and e-cash [28] are well-known examples of this. In our work, we consider anonymity in the context of public-key broadcast encryption, a primitive designed to address a dynamically changing set of receivers for the secure distribution of digital data. The importance of time. As the amount of transmitted and stored digital content rapidly increases, concerns naturally arise regarding the accessibility of such data. In this context, the dimension of time has become significantly relevant. Indeed, security research aims to address not only the issue of who can access the content, but also when and for how long. In the cryptographic literature, the element of time has appeared in several contexts, as the following examples will illustrate. In the IBE setting [16], for instance, it was suggested to extend the identity of a user so as to include a decryption time, allowing therefore to encrypt to the future. A whole branch of research is dedicated to the study and development of timedrelease encryption [65, 27, 26], a primitive which precisely allows a sender to specify a release-time for the encrypted message, before which encryption is not possible. Some effort has also been put in developing ways to make the data unavailable after it has passed its expiry date. The Ephemeral line of research, initiated by [74], and the Vanish system [49] are examples of this. Our work on time-specific encryption offers a cryptographic solution to access data in a specific time interval, and its efficient realisation makes it suitable for many practical applications. 8
9 1.3 Organization of the thesis 1.3 Organization of the thesis In this thesis we give a series of results in the context of public-key encryption. We start by fixing the notation and giving some basic definitions and security models, key to the development of our work, in Chapter 2. Our contributions are then presented in the chapters that follow. More specifically, in Chapter 3 we propose new notions of robustness, which (informally) is the security property that deals with the issue of using the wrong private key for decryption. We justify the need for such notions and provide generic ways to achieve the strongest robustness notion we introduce. The work presented in this chapter appears in [45]. In Chapter 4 we consider the fundamental problem of anonymity in the context of broadcast encryption. After giving formal definitions and security models for the corresponding primitive, we provide constructions to achieve it securely. These results will appear in the proceedings of the international cryptographic conference Public-Key Cryptography 2012 as part of [62]. Finally, in Chapter 5, we introduce a new primitive, called time-specific encryption, which allows the sender to express a time interval during the encryption process, specifying the period a ciphertext can be decrypted. We present several flavours of this primitive and show how to generically and securely achieve schemes in the different settings. This work was published as [71] at the conference Security and Cryptography for Networks 2010 and received the Best Paper Award. The topics presented in this thesis are connected by the dynamics of our research, namely the study of one problem led to the consideration of another and so on. For instance, we proposed the notion of time-specific encryption (TSE) to address a practical issue arising from a shortcoming of timed-release encryption, a closely related primitive. While developing ways to achieve TSE we realized that broadcast encryption (BE) could be used for this purpose. This brought us to the study of the relevant literature, through which we discovered the limitations of the current BE security models and schemes. Our work on anonymous broadcast encryption 9
10 1.3 Organization of the thesis developed naturally from here. Since in an anonymous setting ciphertexts do not reveal the intended recipients, we had to address the issue of receivers using their private key on possibly the wrong ciphertext. Precisely this was our motivation for looking at robustness, which eventually resulted in the development of new, stronger notions, for which we provide provably secure constructions. This brief illustration of our research flow has hopefully made the connecting line between our results more visible. In any case, for each topic, we will give (in the relevant chapter) a detailed introduction, inclusive of motivation, related work and a more in-depth description of our contributions. 10
11 Chapter 2 Preliminaries Contents 2.1 Notation Provable security Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives Public-key encryption Identity-based encryption Attribute-based encryption Digital signatures Commitments Cryptographic tools and techniques A useful proof technique A useful transformation In this chapter we introduce the basic notation that will be adopted throughout this thesis, as well as some of the fundamental concepts of provable security which have been used in our work. We then provide the formal definitions and security models for the cryptographic primitives relevant to the following chapters. 2.1 Notation We introduce some basic notation that will be adopted in this and the following chapters. - By := we denote a definition, with the definiens on the right-hand side (RHS) and the definiendum on the left-hand side (LHS). 11
12 2.1 Notation - G denotes an algebraic group, Z denotes the integers, N the non-negative integers and R the reals. - p denotes a prime, Z p the cyclic group of order p and Z p := Z p \{0}, i.e. the group without the neutral element. - MsgSp, CtSp, IdSp, SSp, KSp, VSp are the spaces for messages, ciphertexts, identities, signatures, keys and values, respectively. - O denotes an oracle and O sk denotes an oracle equipped with sk. The behaviour of an oracle will be made explicit in the relevant definitions. - By we denote a random assignment where the RHS is either a finite set or a probabilistic algorithm. In the former case, it denotes the assignment to the LHS of a random value chosen uniformly from the set; in the latter it denotes choosing the algorithm s random tape uniformly and assigning the outcome to the LHS. - If s and t are two bit strings, s t denotes the concatenation of s and t, and s t denotes their exclusive or. - {0,1} n denotes all bit strings of length n. - Algorithms are assumed to be polynomial time (p.t.) or probabilistic polynomial time (p.p.t.). If algorithm Alg is run on inputs x and y, we denote it by Alg(x,y), and if r is the internal randomness we may make it explicit by writing Alg(x, y; r). - λ N denotes a security parameter. By convention, the running time of an algorithm is measured as a function of the length of its input, and therefore λ will be provided to the algorithm in unary as 1 λ (i.e. the string of λ ones). - A function f : N R is called negligible if for all c N there exists k 0 N such that for all k > k 0 : f(k) < 1 k. c - The symbol denotes a distinguished output of an algorithm intended to indicate an error. 12
13 2.2 Provable security 2.2 Provable security The aim of this thesis is to provide constructions for public-key encryption primitives with enhanced properties, maintaining a balance between security and efficiency whilst achieving the desired functionality. In order to do so, we make extensive use of the tools and techniques of provable security, which provides a rigorous mathematical framework for the security analysis and proofs of our schemes. In presenting the results in this thesis our approach will typically be the following. As a first step, we will give a formal definition of the cryptographic primitive we wish to study. This is essentially the description of the algorithms (with their inputs and outputs) that constitute the primitive. The next step is to define an adversarial model which formally specifies what a computationally bounded adversary is allowed to do when perpetrating an attack. Such a model should capture the idea of what it means for a primitive to be secure with respect to a specific security goal (e.g confidentiality, anonymity,...). The security models we present will be described as games between a benign entity called the challenger and an adversary, which may or may not have access to a set of oracles controlled by the challenger. We specify a winning condition for the game and we typically define the adversary s advantage as a measure of the success of its strategy over that of simply guessing. There are two common approaches when studying computational security: the concrete one and the asymptotic one ([57, Chapter 3] provides an interesting discussion on the topic). The asymptotic approach is the one we will follow in this thesis. Here, the running time of the adversary as well as its success probability are functions of the security parameter λ, as opposed to concrete numbers. In particular, an adversary is a probabilistic algorithm whose running time is polynomial in λ and whose success probability we would like to be negligible in λ. This leads to the following informal definition ([57]): A scheme is secure if for every p.p.t. adversary A playing a game of some specified type, the advantage of A in winning the game (where the winning condition is also well-defined) is negligible. 13
14 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives The following step is to achieve the specified primitive with the desired security properties. To this goal, we present possible constructions for it (typically using simpler cryptographic primitives as building blocks), and prove that such constructions yield secure schemes. To prove a scheme is secure with respect to a specific security model, we reduce its security to that of the underlying cryptographic primitive or to the hard problem it is based on. More specifically, providing a proof of security (also called a reduction) involves converting any efficient adversary that has a non-negligible advantage in winning the specific game into another efficient algorithm that succeeds in breaking the underlying primitive or in solving a hard problem. This is nowadays a standard proof technique in cryptography. It is within this framework that the research presented in this thesis has been conducted. 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives Cryptographic primitives are the basic building blocks used to construct more complex cryptographic systems. Their algorithms are designed to achieve a variety of functionalities and they are carefully crafted so as to satisfy the required security properties. While there are many such primitives, the focus of this thesis will be on primitives in the public-key setting. We recall the ones relevant to our work next Public-key encryption In a public-key encryption(pke) scheme anyone can encrypt a message with respect to a public key, but only the holder of the corresponding secret key can recover it. The two keys, i.e the public encryption key and the secret decryption key, have to be mathematically related and it should be hard to obtain the secret key simply by knowing the public key. We present a definition for PKE. This slightly differs from the usual notation by 14
16 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives lar, we define the security notion of indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA) [52, 77] for a PKE scheme Π = (PKE.PG, PKE.KeyGen, PKE.Enc, PKE.Dec) as follows. IND-CCA security game for PKE Setup. The challenger C runs PKE.PG(1 λ ) to generate pars and PKE.KeyGen(pars) to obtain a key-pair (pk,sk). C gives (pars,pk) to the adversary A. Phase 1. A has access to a decryption oracle O sk, to which it submits queries of the type C. The oracle returns PKE.Dec(pars, pk, C, sk). Challenge. A selects two equal-length messages M 0, M 1 MsgSp and passes them to C. C chooses a random bit b {0,1} and computes C PKE.Enc(pars, M b,pk). C is called the challenge ciphertext and it is passed to A. Phase 2. AcontinuestohaveaccesstoadecryptionoracleO sk, withtherestriction that it cannot submit the query C to this oracle. Guess. The adversary outputs its guess b for b. We define A s advantage in the above game as Adv IND CCA A,Π (λ) = Pr[b = b] 1 2. Intuitively, the advantage is a measure of how successful the adversary s strategy in the game is over that of simply guessing the bit b. Definition 2.2 (IND-CCA) A PKE scheme Π = (PKE.PG, PKE.KeyGen, PKE.Enc, PKE.Dec) is indistinguishable under chosen-ciphertext attacks (or is IND- CCA secure) if all p.p.t. adversaries have at most negligible advantage in the above game. It is possible to define a weaker notion of security, namely indistinguishability under chosen-plaintext attacks (IND-CPA), by removing the adversary s access to the decryption oracle O sk in the game described above. 16
17 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives Since it will be relevant in this thesis, we recall a security notion for public-key encryption which models both indistinguishability and anonymity. In the public-key setting, the latter is often referred to as key-privacy, and was introduced by Bellare et al. in [8]. Informally, a PKE scheme is key-private if the ciphertext does not leak under which public key it was created. The authors of [8] give two notions of security of indistinguishability of keys (IK), IK-CPA and IK-CCA, which model key-privacy under chosen-plaintext and chosen-ciphertext attacks, respectively. We will use a combined notion of security, which helps streamline our presentation and proofs. The relevant game and security notion are as follows. IND-IK-CCA security game for PKE Setup. The challenger C runs PKE.PG(1 λ ) to generate pars and PKE.KeyGen(pars) twice to obtain two key-pairs (pk 0,sk 0 ) and (pk 1,sk 1 ). C gives (pars,pk 0,pk 1 ) to the adversary A. Phase 1. AhasaccesstoadecryptionoracleO sk 0,sk 1, towhichitsubmitsqueriesof thetype(c,pk i ),i {0,1}. Morespecifically,theoraclereturnsPKE.Dec(pars, pk i,c,sk i ), i {0,1}. Challenge. A selects two equal-length messages M 0, M 1 MsgSp and passes them to C. C chooses a random bit b {0,1} and computes C PKE.Enc(pars, M b,pk b ). C is called the challenge ciphertext and it is passed to A. Phase 2. A continues to have access to the decryption oracle, with the restriction that it cannot submit queries containing C to the oracle. Guess. The adversary outputs its guess b for b. WedefineA sadvantageintheabovegameasadv IND IK CCA A,Π (λ) = Pr[b = b] 1 2. Definition 2.3 (IND-IK-CCA) A PKE scheme Π = (PKE.PG, PKE.KeyGen, PKE.Enc, PKE.Dec) is indistinguishable and key-private under chosen-ciphertext attacks (or is IND-IK-CCA secure) if all p.p.t. adversaries have at most negligible advantage in the above game. 17
18 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives Also here we can define a weaker notion of security, namely IND-IK-CPA, by removing the adversary s access to the decryption oracles. We note that for simplicity, and in accordance with the majority of the relevant literature, we decided to model indistinguishability and anonymity by letting the challenger randomly pick one bit, used to select both the message and the key. An alternative and equivalent approach would be to let the challenger select two bits, one for the message and one for the key. All primitives for which we model indistinguishability and anonymity in this thesis will be analyzed and proved secure in the 1-bit setting. Examples of IND-IK-ATK secure schemes, where ATK {CPA, CCA}, are the ElGamal [48] and the Cramer Shoup [37] encryption schemes. Furthermore, in [73], the authors present a generic way to achieve an IND-IK-CCA secure PKE scheme from identity-based encryption, a primitive which we introduce next Identity-based encryption Identity-based encryption (IBE) was first proposed by Shamir in 1984 [82], but was only realized in 2000 by Sakai, Ohgishi and Kasahara [80], and in 2001 in the works of Boneh and Franklin [16] and Cocks [34]. The key idea in IBE is that the public key of a user can be an arbitrary string, typically representing his identity (e.g.theuser s address),ratherthanastringthatisoutputbyakeygeneration algorithm as in normal PKE. The main motivation behind the introduction of IBE is that it simplifies the problem of certificate management, distinctive to public-key cryptography. This however requires a Trusted Authority (TA) to issue the users corresponding secret keys. The need for such an authority is an inherent feature of the identity-based setting. We next formalize the description of the IBE primitive, introducing an additional parameter generation algorithm, IBE.PG, for ease of exposition. As in the PKE case, the standard notion is recovered simply by letting IBE.PG output the security parameter. 18
20 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives IND-ID-CCA security game for IBE Setup. The challenger C runs IBE.PG(1 λ ) to generate pars and IBE.Setup(pars) to obtain the master public key ID-MPK and the master secret key ID-MSK and gives (pars, ID-MPK) to the adversary A. Phase 1. A has access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O ID-MSK, to obtain secret keys of any id IdSp. A has also access to a decryption oracle O ID-MSK, to which it submits queries of the type (C, id). This oracle returns IBE.Dec(ID-MPK,C,sk id ), where sk id is extracted using ID-MSK. Challenge. A selects two equal-length messages M 0 and M 1 MsgSp and an id IdSp with the restriction that for none of the secret-key-extraction queries in Phase 1 we have that id = id. A passes M 0,M 1,id to C. C chooses a random bit b {0,1} and computes C IBE.Enc(ID-MPK,M b,id ). C is called the challenge ciphertext and it is passed to A. Phase 2. A continues to have access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O ID-MSK, with the same restriction we have in the Challenge phase, and to a decryption oracle O ID-MSK, with the restriction that it cannot submit the query (C,id ) to this oracle. Guess. The adversary outputs its guess b for b. WedefineA sadvantageintheabovegameasadv IND ID CCA A,I (λ) = Pr[b = b] 1 2. Definition 2.5 (IND-ID-CCA) An IBE scheme I = (IBE.PG, IBE.Setup, IBE.KeyExt, IBE.Enc, IBE.Dec) is indistinguishable under chosen-ciphertext attacks (or is IND-ID-CCA secure) if all p.p.t. adversaries have at most negligible advantage in the above game. We define the notion of IND-ID-CPA security (indistinguishability under chosenplaintext attacks) by removing the adversary s access to the decryption oracle in the game described above. In our work we will make use of a weaker security notion for IBE called selectiveid security, introduced in [24, 13], where an adversary has to output a challenge 20
21 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives identity id at the beginning of the game. The identity id will be then used by the challenger as the identity to which encrypt M b. We give details of this game next. sid-ind-cca security game for IBE Initialize. The challenger C runs IBE.PG(1 λ ) to generate pars and gives them to the adversary A. A outputs id IdSp. Setup. C runs IBE.Setup(pars) to obtain the master public key ID-MPK and the master secret key ID-MSK and gives ID-MPK to A. Phase 1. A has access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O ID-MSK, to obtain secret keys of any id id IdSp. A has also access to a decryption oracle O ID-MSK, to which it submits queries of the type (C,id). Challenge. A selects two equal-length messages M 0 and M 1 MsgSp. A passes M 0,M 1 to C. C chooses a random bit b {0,1} and computes C IBE.Enc(ID-MPK,M b,id ). C is called the challenge ciphertext and it is passed to A. Phase 2. Acontinuestohaveaccesstoasecret-key-extractionoracleO ID-MSK, with the same restriction we have in Phase 1, and to a decryption oracle O ID-MSK, with the restriction that it cannot submit the query (C,id ) to this oracle. Guess. The adversary outputs its guess b for b. We define A s advantage as Adv sid IND CCA A,I (λ) = Pr[b = b] 1 2. Definition 2.6 (sid-ind-cca) An IBE scheme I = (IBE.PG, IBE.Setup, IBE.KeyExt, IBE.Enc, IBE.Dec) is selective-id indistinguishable under chosenciphertext attacks (or sid-ind-cca secure) if all p.p.t. adversaries have at most negligible advantage in the above game. Removing access to the decryption oracle gives rise to the notion of sid-ind- CPA security. 21
22 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives As for the public-key setting, it is useful at this point to give the security notion for anonymous IBE [1], which informally models the idea that a ciphertext does not leak the identity of the intended recipient. We present a combined notion of indistinguishability and anonymity for IBE in the following game. ANO-IND-CCA security game for IBE Setup. The challenger C runs IBE.PG(1 λ ) to generate pars and IBE.Setup(pars) to obtain the master public key ID-MPK and the master secret key ID-MSK and gives (pars, ID-MPK) to the adversary A. Phase 1. A has access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O ID-MSK, to obtain secret keys of any id IdSp. A has also access to a decryption oracle O ID-MSK, to which it submits queries of the type (C,id). Challenge. A selects two equal-length messages M 0, M 1 MsgSp and two identities id 0, id 1 IdSp with the restriction that for none of the secret-keyextraction queries in Phase 1 we have that id = id 0 or id = id 1. A passes M 0,M 1,id 0,id 1 to C. C chooses a random bit b {0,1} and computes C IBE.Enc(ID-MPK,M b,id b ). C is called the challenge ciphertext and it is passed to A. Phase 2. A continues to have access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O ID-MSK, with the same restriction we have in the Challenge phase, and to a decryption oracle O ID-MSK, with the restriction that it cannot submit the queries (C,id 0 ) or (C,id 1 ), to this oracle. Guess. The adversary outputs its guess b for b. We define A s advantage as Adv ANO IND CCA A,I (λ) = Pr[b = b] 1 2. Definition 2.7 (ANO-IND-CCA) An IBE scheme I = (IBE.PG, IBE.Setup, IBE.KeyExt,IBE.Enc,IBE.Dec) is anonymous and indistinguishable under chosenciphertext attacks (or ANO-IND-CCA secure) if all p.p.t. adversaries have at most negligible advantage in the above game. 22
23 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives As usual, removing access to the decryption oracle defines the corresponding notion of security in a chosen-plaintext attack scenario. Since it will be relevant to our work, we briefly recall the notion of multi-ta IBE [72], where multiple and independent trusted authorities coexist in the system. A typical multi-ta IBE scheme consists of five algorithms: IBE.PG, which takes as input the security parameter and outputs the shared parameters pars and a set of labels of the TAs in the system; IBE.TASetup, which takes as input pars and outputs a master public key and a master secret key (this is run independently for each TA in the system); IBE.KeyExt, IBE.Enc, IBE.Dec as for a normal IBE scheme. Security notions such as indistinguishability and recipient anonymity have been considered in this setting in [72], where in particular the notion of multi-ta anonymity was introduced and studied. Informally, this models the idea that a ciphertext does not leak the master public key under which it was created. It should therefore be hard for an adversary to distinguish between two ciphertexts generated under two distinct master public keys, even if for the same message and the same identity. In [72] several security models for multi-ta IBE were put forth. We recall the one relevant for our work next. sid-taa-ind-cpa security game for multi-authority IBE Initialize. The challenger C runs IBE.PG(1 λ ) to generate pars and gives them to the adversary A. A outputs id IdSp. Setup. C runs IBE.TASetup(pars) to obtain master public keys MPK i and master secret keys MSK i where i {1,...,n} for all TAs in the system. C gives {MPK i } i {1,...,n} to A. Phase 1. A has access to a corrupt oracle O {MSKi} to obtain the master secret key of TA i where i {1,...,n}. It has also access to a secret-key-extraction oracle to which it can submit queries of the form (i,id), where i is a TA and id IdSp, in order to obtain the secret key corresponding to identity id under the trusted authority i. Challenge. A selects two equal-length messages M 0 and M 1 MsgSp and two TAs i 0 and i 1, with the restriction that neither i 0 nor i 1 was corrupted and 23
24 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives none of the queries in Phase 1 was of the form (i j,id ), with j {0,1}. A passes M 0,M 1,i 0,i 1 to C. C chooses a random bit b {0,1} and computes C IBE.Enc(MPK ib,m b,id ). C is called the challenge ciphertext and it is passed to A. Phase 2. A continues to have access to a corrupt oracle and a secret-key-extraction oracle with the same restrictions we have in the challenge phase. Guess. The adversary outputs its guess b for b. We define A s advantage as Adv sid TAA IND CPA A,I (λ) = Pr[b = b] 1 2. Definition 2.8 (sid-taa-ind-cpa) A multi-ta IBE scheme I = (IBE.PG, IBE.TASetup, IBE.KeyExt, IBE.Enc, IBE.Dec) is selective-id, TA-anonymous and indistinguishable under chosen-plaintext attacks (or sid-taa-ind-cpa secure) if all p.p.t. adversaries have at most negligible advantage in the above game. An example of IBE scheme satisfying the notion of sid-taa-ind-cpa security is the multi-ta version of Gentry s IBE scheme [50], as shown in [73]. We note that by having i 0 = i 1 we obtain the standard notion of selective-id security under chosen-plaintext attacks (sid-ind-cpa) for a multi-ta IBE scheme Attribute-based encryption Attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive first introduced by Sahai and Waters [79]. The key idea in ABE is that a user can decrypt only if he has the appropriate set of attributes. We are hence intuitively encrypting to a set of users, as opposed to one as in the standard public-key and identitybased settings. In doing so our main concern is to avoid collusion attacks, which would allow distinct users to combine their attributes in order to decrypt something that individually they would not have been able to. ABE historically has two main flavours: key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) and ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE). In KP- ABE [53, 70] the attributes are associated with the ciphertext while the policy is 24
25 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives expressed in the key. In CP-ABE [12, 32] the situation is reversed, giving the sender the control over what policy needs to be satisfied in order to decrypt. Typically, such a policy will be expressed in terms of an access structure, as defined in [7]. Definition 2.9 (Access structure) Let P = {P 1,P 2,...,P n } be a set of parties and let 2 P denote its power set. A collection A 2 P is monotone if for every B and C, if B A and B C then C A. An access structure (respectively, monotone access structure) is a collection (respectively, monotone collection) A of non-empty subsets of P, i.e. P \. The sets in A are called the authorized sets, and the sets not in A are called the unauthorized sets. In our work, as in most relevant literature [53, 12], we will restrict ourselves to monotone access structures which will be specified by access trees. In this model, each interior node of a tree T is a threshold gate and the leaves are associated with attributes. If a set of attributes S satisfies the access tree T, we denote it as T (S) = 1. 1 This is defined recursively for T x, the subtree of T rooted at node x. In particular, if x is a leaf node, then T x (S) returns 1 if and only if the attribute associated to the leaf node x belongs to S. This is the framework within which we provide the formal definitions and security models for CP-ABE and KP-ABE. Definition 2.10 (CP-ABE scheme) A ciphertext-policy ABE(CP-ABE) scheme is defined by five algorithms, which are as follows. CP ABE.PG: This algorithm takes as input the security parameter 1 λ and returns the system s parameters pars. These will include the message space MsgSp, the ciphertext space CtSp and the universe of attributes U associated to the scheme. We write this as pars CP ABE.PG(1 λ ). CP ABE.Setup: This algorithm takes as input pars and returns a master public key CP-MPKandamastersecretkeyCP-MSK. Wewrite(CP-MPK,CP-MSK) CP ABE.Setup(pars). 1 In general, if S satisfies an access structure A, we denote it as S A 25
26 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives CP ABE.KeyGen: This is a key generation algorithm that on input CP-MPK, CP-MSK and a set of attributes S U outputs a secret key sk S. We write this as sk S CP ABE.KeyGen(CP-MPK,CP-MSK,S). CP ABE.Enc: This is an encryption algorithm that on input CP-MPK, a message M MsgSp and an access structure A over the universe of attributes U returns a ciphertext C CtSp. We write this as C CP ABE.Enc(CP-MPK,M,A). CP ABE.Dec: This is a decryption algorithm that on input CP-MPK, a ciphertext C and a secret key sk S returns either a message or a failure symbol. We write this as CP ABE.Dec(CP-MPK,C,sk S ) = M, where M MsgSp { }. These algorithms are required to satisfy the following correctness property: For every λ, for every pars output by CP ABE.PG, for every CP-MPK, CP-MSK output by CP ABE.Setup, for every message M MsgSp and for every access structure A supported by the system, if sk S CP ABE.KeyGen(CP-MPK,CP-MSK,S), if C CP ABE.Enc(CP-MPK,M,A) and if S A, then CP ABE.Dec(CP-MPK,C,sk S ) = M. We define indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA) for a CP-ABE scheme Γ = (CP ABE.PG,CP ABE.Setup,CP ABE.KeyGen,CP ABE.Enc, CP ABE.Dec) in the following way. IND-CCA security game for CP-ABE Setup. The challenger C runs CP ABE.PG(1 λ ) to obtain pars and CP ABE.Setup(pars) to generate the master public key CP-MPK and the master secret key CP-MSK and gives (pars, CP-MPK) to the adversary A. Phase 1. A has access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O CP-MSK, to obtain secret keys for any set of attributes S U. A has also access to a decryption oracle O CP-MSK, to which it submits queries of the type (C,S). Such an oracle will respond with CP ABE.Dec(CP-MPK,C,sk S ), where sk S is extracted using CP-MSK. Challenge. A selects two equal-length messages M 0 and M 1 MsgSp and a challenge access structure A with the restriction that none of the attribute sets 26
27 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives for which a key was queried in Phase 1 satisfy A. A passes M 0,M 1,A to C. C choosesarandombitb {0,1}andcomputesC CP ABE.Enc(CP-MPK,M b, A ). C is called the challenge ciphertext and it is passed to A. Phase 2. A continues to have access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O CP-MSK, with the same restriction we have in the Challenge phase, and to a decryption oracle O CP-MSK, with the restriction that it cannot submit the query (C,S), for any S satisfying A. Guess. The adversary outputs its guess b for b. We define A s advantage in the above game as Adv IND CCA A,Γ (λ) = Pr[b = b] 1 2. Definition 2.11 (IND-CCA) A CP-ABE scheme Γ = (CP ABE.PG,CP ABE.Setup, CP ABE.KeyGen,CP ABE.Enc,CP ABE.Dec) is indistinguishable under chosen-ciphertext attacks (or is IND-CCA secure) if all p.p.t. adversaries have at most negligible advantage in the above game. We next recall the other type of ABE scheme, namely KP-ABE. Definition 2.12 (KP-ABE scheme) A key-policy ABE(KP-ABE) scheme is defined by five algorithms, which are as follows. KP ABE.PG: This algorithm takes as input the security parameter 1 λ and returns the system s parameters pars. These will include a description of the message space MsgSp, the ciphertext space CtSp and the universe of attributes U associated to the scheme. We write this as pars KP ABE.PG(1 λ ). KP ABE.Setup: This algorithm takes as input pars and returns a master public key KP-MPKandamastersecretkeyKP-MSK. Wewrite(KP-MPK,KP-MSK) KP ABE.Setup(pars). KP ABE.KeyGen: This is a key generation algorithm that on input KP-MPK, KP-MSK and an access structure A outputs a secret key sk A. We write this as sk A KP ABE.KeyGen(KP-MPK,KP-MSK,A). 27
28 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives KP ABE.Enc: This is an encryption algorithm that on input KP-MPK, a message M MsgSp and a set of attributes S U returns a ciphertext C CtSp. We write this as C KP ABE.Enc(KP-MPK,M,S). KP ABE.Dec: This is a decryption algorithm that on input KP-MPK, a ciphertext C and a secret key sk A returns either a message or a failure symbol. We write this as KP ABE.Dec(KP-MPK,C,sk A ) = M, where M MsgSp { }. These algorithms are required to satisfy the following correctness property: For every λ, for every pars output by KP ABE.PG, for every KP-MPK,KP-MSK output by KP ABE.KeyGen, for every message M MsgSp, for every access structure A supported by the system and every set of attributes S U, if sk A KP ABE.KeyGen(KP-MPK,KP-MSK,A), if C KP ABE.Enc(KP-MPK,M,S) and if S A, then KP ABE.Dec(KP-MPK,C,sk A ) = M. We define indistinguishability under chosen-ciphertext attacks (IND-CCA) for a KP-ABE scheme K = (KP ABE.PG,KP ABE.Setup,KP ABE.KeyGen,KP ABE.Enc, KP ABE.Dec) in the following way. IND-CCA security game for KP-ABE Setup. The challenger C runs KP ABE.PG(1 λ ) to obtain pars and KP ABE.Setup(pars) to generate the master public key KP-MPK and the master secret key KP-MSK and gives (pars, KP-MPK) to the adversary A. Phase 1. A has access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O KP-MSK, to obtain secret keys for access structures A i. A has also access to a decryption oracle O KP-MSK, to which it submits queries of the type (C,A), where A is an access structure supported by the system. Such an oracle will respond with KP ABE.Dec(KP-MPK,C,sk A ), where sk A is extracted using KP-MSK. Challenge. A selects two equal-length messages M 0 and M 1 MsgSp and a challenge set of attributes S U with the restriction that none of the access structures for which a key was queried in Phase 1 are satisfied by S. A passes M 0,M 1,S to C. C chooses a random bit b {0,1} and computes 28
29 2.3 Formal definitions of cryptographic primitives C KP ABE.Enc(KP-MPK,M b,s ). C is called the challenge ciphertext and it is passed to A. Phase 2. A continues to have access to a secret-key-extraction oracle O KP-MSK, with the same restriction we have in the Challenge phase, and to a decryption oracle O KP-MSK, with the restriction that it cannot submit the query (C,A), for any access structure A satisfied by S. Guess. The adversary outputs its guess b for b. We define A s advantage in the above game as Adv IND CCA A,K (λ) = Pr[b = b] 1 2. Definition 2.13 (IND-CCA) A KP-ABE scheme K = (KP ABE.PG,KP ABE.Setup, KP ABE.KeyGen,KP ABE.Enc,KP ABE.Dec) is indistinguishableunderchosen-ciphertext attacks (or is IND-CCA secure) if all p.p.t. adversaries have at most negligible advantage in the above game. The security models we have presented so far address adversaries that can adaptively issue queries before and after the challenge phase. Most relevant work in the area [53, 32, 12, 70], however, achieves security only in the selective setting, where a less powerful adversary has to select a priori the set (or policy) he wishes to be challenged on. In [61], Lewko et al. provide a fully secure ABE scheme in the more general framework of functional encryption. Follow-up work in the area (for instance, [69]) also achieves this level of security. Anonymity in ABE. As for previously considered primitives such as PKE and IBE, also in the context of ABE the issue of anonymity arises naturally. In the case of CP-ABE we call it policy-hiding property, reflecting that the ciphertext does not leak under what policy (access structure) it was created. Similarly for KP-ABE we denote it attribute-hiding property, capturing the idea that an adversary cannot tell what set of attributes a message was encrypted for. This notion was first introduced and achieved in the context of predicate encryption [58] for the special class of predicates defined by inner products. These security notions are modeled in the natural way: an adversary selects two access structures (respectively, attribute sets) in the challenge phase and he will 29

5 Recent Projects Two-dimensional spectral shearing interferometry. Invented and built a computerautomated experimental method to characterize single-optical-cycle laser pulses. Demonstrated on a 4.9 femtosecond pulse. The system involved nonlinear optical interferometry over an octave of bandwidth. The system has been patented and licensed to Menlo Systems, Inc, and is in the process of being commercialized. This work has received four invited publications. Preconditioned Newton-Krylov solver for nonlinear optical resonators. Developed and implemented an algorithm which models a femtosecond laser cavity using a matriximplicit shooting method, solved using a generalized Newton-Krylov solver with a diagonal preconditioner to speed convergence. The solver works three or four orders of magnitude faster than the standard method of dynamic simulation for typical femtosecond laser resonators. Massively parallel optical device optimization. Based on the observation that merit functions for optical devices (e.g. thin film filters) tend to have local minima which are quasi-regularly spaced in the design space, implemented a global optimization via a parallel implementation (using C++ and MPI on a linux cluster) of a simple combinatorial optimization algorithm (best improvement local search). Was able to double performance of test filters relative to standard gradient methods. Dispersive thin film filter optimization software. Developed software for the design and optimization of thin film interference filters for producing very precise amounts of controlled dispersion, essential in the engineering of femtosecond lasers. Invented and published a novel inductive algorithm for efficiently computing the approximate group delay of a multilayer dielectric film. Used in numerous successful research lasers, as well as commercial lasers and filters sold by Thorlabs, Inc.

2 R&S ENY81-CA6 Coupling Network At a glance The R&S ENY81-CA6 coupling network is used for performing radio disturbance and immunity measurements on unshielded symmetrical telecommunications ports for cable category CAT 6. The R&S ENY81-CA6 coupling network is used for measuring asymmetrical (common-mode) disturbance voltage on unshielded, symmetrical telecommunications ports of equipment under test (EUT). The coupling network contains two RJ-45 ports for connecting the EUT and the associated equipment (AE). On the EUT side, a longitudinal conversion loss (LCL) of 75 db is implemented to simulate operation with a category CAT 6 cable. Measurements can be performed in the frequency range from 150 khz to 30 MHz and conform to the CISPR 22:2005 and EN 55022: 2006 product standards. The R&S ENY81-CA6 can also be used for immunity measurements. These measurements are performed in line with CISPR 24 and EN as well as IEC in the frequency range from 150 khz to 80 MHz. The R&S ENY81-CA6 is tested and calibrated in accordance with CISPR The calibration data supplied with the unit is valid for a symmetrical impedance of 100 Ω. Key facts JJ Eight-wire network JJ Radio disturbance measurements in line with CISPR 22: 2005 and EN 55022: 2006 (150 khz to 30 MHz) JJ Immunity measurements in line with CISPR 24 and EN (150 khz to 80 MHz) JJ CISPR complied with JJ 75 db longitudinal conversion loss (LCL) JJ High transmission bandwidth for wanted signal (250 MHz) Nomenclature In the CISPR 22: 2005 and EN 55022: 2006 product standards, this type of coupling network is referred to as an impedance stabilization network (ISN). In basic standards, it is called asymmetrical artificial network (AAN), Y-network (CISPR 16) or coupling/decoupling network (CDN; IEC ). 2
3 R&S ENY81-CA6 Coupling Network Benefits and key features Functional description The R&S ENY81-CA6 terminates the EUT interface with 150 Ω (asymmetrical or common-mode impedance) and couples the EUT's asymmetrical voltage to the test receiver with a voltage division factor of typ. 9.5 db. The wanted symmetrical (differential-mode) signal passes through the coupling network almost without attenuation up to a bandwidth of 250 MHz (valid for a symmetrical impedance of 100 Ω). At the same time, the coupling network decouples the test circuit from disturbance effects (disturbance voltage, impedance) at the AE port. The R&S ENY81-CA6 coupling network features bare threaded sockets for connecting it to a reference ground plane that is arranged either horizontally or vertically. Radio disturbance measurements In line with CISPR 22: 2005 and EN 55022: 2006, disturbance voltage measurements on one unshielded symmetrical wire pair require the use of a two-wire ISN (R&S ENY21). In the case of two unshielded symmetrical wire pairs, it is necessary to use a four-wire ISN (R&S ENY41), and with four unshielded symmetrical wire pairs an eight-wire ISN (R&S ENY81 or R&S ENY81-CA6) is needed. CISPR 22: 2005 and EN 55022: 2006 specify the following conformance test method: The EUT is to be measured with a suppression of the wanted symmetrical signal corresponding to the category of the connected cable ( requirements for cable categories CAT 3, CAT 5 and CAT 6 are defined in the standard). In order to implement these test methods, the R&S ENY81-CA6 consists of a high-symmetry basic network with a longitudinal conversion loss of 75 db for cable category CAT 6. The LCL is internally implemented on the EUT side. For cable categories CAT 3 and CAT 5, the R&S ENY81 eight-wire coupling network is to be used. Immunity measurements For immunity measurements, a 150 Ω to 50 Ω adapter (100 Ω series resistor in line with IEC ) is required in order to calibrate the test system. This series or terminating resistor as well as various adapters for connecting the ISN are included in the R&S ENY-ITS immunity test set, which is available as an option. Functional testing A functional test of the ISN can be performed by means of the R&S ENY-FTS option and a network analyzer. The functional test includes verification of the asymmetrical impedance and phase, the voltage division factor, the longitudinal conversion loss and the decoupling attenuation. Compact, cost-effective test set consisting of the R&S ESCI EMI test receiver and the R&S ENY81-CA6 coupling network for the semiautomatic measurement of the asymmetrical disturbance voltage. 3

I'm sure every hairstylist would say they have the best clients, but I really think I do. A few of my clients have been kind enough to share their thoughts.
"Suzanne's the only one who gets it right every time. When once or twice I snuck behind her back to another chair, it looked like Holy Heck* less than three weeks later!” ~Chuck Rosene
“I have been a client of Suzanne's since her daughter was a little girl. Ottilia has now graduated from college. My hair has changed in the passing years, but Suzanne's talent with cut and color has kept me looking great.” ~ Dirk Epperson
"For nearly twenty years now, I have had confidence in how my hair looks. I know I can trust Suzanne to handle my cut and color with both subtlety and style"
“I do love working with Suzanne on my image. As a professional who travels to Washington DC for meetings in Congress and at the White House, I need to look my best with ease. The quality and craftsmanship of Suzanne’s work is perfect.” ~ Kathy Ko Chin (pictured above shaking hands with President Obama)
“I moved to DC temporarily and I have just never found a hairstylist I like as much as Suzanne Whenever I come home to Oakland, I do whatever I can to get into see her. My colleagues in DC notice and compliment me- they notice the difference!” ~ Carol G.
“My husband and I both went to Suzanne to get sophisticated new haircuts for a move to Washington DC. The new haircuts were great. We keep coming back (yes, 3000 miles) every chance we get. In fact Mark had an appointment with Suzanne this past weekend!” ~Lucia & Mark Savage

About a year after I took over as AP correspondent in charge of the bureau in São Paulo, Brazil, the U.S. Consulate there got a new press officer, Gene Harter. I don’t recall the circumstances of our first meeting, but I do remember that there was an instant affinity. Unlike most of the guys who turned up in such jobs, Gene was a veteran newspaperman. He knew the business inside out, and although he had never worked as a foreign correspondent his background gave him a good understanding of what we were doing. More importantly his background endeared him to Brazilian newspapermen, particularly those in smaller cities who were struggling to adapt to more modern technology. Gene was a big help to them because he had also sold presses for Harris-Intertype in the early 1960s and understood the technology.
I remember well the first time I met Dorothy, Gene’s wife, and their four children. It was at a dinner party at their home and that was, as Bogart told Raines at the end of Casablanca, the beginning of a beautiful friendship, one that lasted despite distance and time.
Among the guests was Claudio Abramo, controversial editor of Folha de São Paulo. Inviting Abramo was a daring, but, as I learned, not untypical move that exemplified Gene’s courage. Abramo was a thorn in the side of the military government, resisting censorship and speaking out against torture. Gene’s support, with the implied backing of the U.S. government, probably kept Abramo out of jail and at his job at Folha.
An even more memorable moment for me came a few weeks later when Gene invited me to accompany him and visiting Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia on a trip to Americana, home of the last surviving “colony” of descendants Southern Americans who had immigrated to Brazil following the U.S. Civil War.
Gene, Jody Powell, Carter’s right-hand man even then, and I rode up to the Americana suburb of Santa Barbara do Oeste where descendants of the Confederados from throughout Brazil had gathered at the little stone church and Confederate monument. I remember Powell commenting on the way there that the terrain was much like that of parts of Georgia.
Carter was coming by helicopter and had planned only about 15 minutes for the stopover before going on to Campinas to visit the Purina plant there.
The crowd gathered (see picture) at the monument and Carter said a few words. Then somebody asked him if he would step into the nearby church and say a prayer. I think his prayer lasted more than 15 minutes. Afterward, he and Rosalynn discovered thecemetery and spent a long time going from headstone to headstone reading the inscriptions. By the time they were ready to leave it was too dark for the helicopter to take off and a car had to be arranged to take the Carters back to São Paulo. They had missed their visit to the plant.
Gene had a special interest in the American descendants. He was one of them. His mother, Maglin Harris, was born in Brazil. She married an American diplomat, Eugene C. Harter, and their son, also Eugene C. Harter, was born in Rio on August 11, 1926. The family moved to the States in 1936 and Gene grew up in Ohio.
Gene later wrote The Lost Colony of the Confederacy about that post-Civil War migration to Brazil. A paperback version is still in print. Gene and Dorothy made several lecture tours on the book, including voyages on luxury liners.
Before becoming a diplomat, Gene owned and published a weekly newspaper in Campbellsville, Kentucky, the News Journal. He ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for Congress in Kentucky before going to work for the government.
Another interesting but less well-known book by Gene is Boilerplating America: The Hidden Newspaper, a history of the use of pre-printed articles distributed to small newspapers throughout the United States in the period between Civil War and the turn of the century.
Gene and I went our separate ways after Brazil, but we kept in touch. Our paths crossed again years later when both of us were living in the Washington, D.C., area. The Harters were living on their houseboat on the Potamac River and Gene would walk to work each day at the State Department. Later Ghislaine and I would visit them on the houseboat, which included a fireplace, in Chestertown, Maryland, after Gene retired. They lived in a beautiful old house on Main Street.
When Ghislaine and I celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary, Gene and Dorothy came, driving the camper in which they were touring the country.
And, by sheer coincidence, when they celebrated their 50th anniversary, the guitarist their children hired to play was our son Richard.
Nice tribute, Ed. What I remember most about Eugene, from the visit we made to Chestertown a few years back, was his knowledge and passion for his ancestry. And, of course, the graciousness.
What a wonderful tribute. I’ve been reading Mr. Harter’s book, “Lost Colony of the Confederacy,” because I lived in Santa Barbara d’Oeste back in the 80s and have always been fascinated by the town’s history and connection to the US. I’ve also recently made several trips to Chestertown, Maryland to research my family’s history, a passion I share with the late Mr. Harter. I’m only sorry I didn’t know then that Mr. Harter lived there. I would have loved looking him up and hearing more about the Lost Colony.
I have just finished reading “The Lost Colony of the Confederacy” which I enjoyed tremendously because I knew many of the descendants and spent lots of time with them. Made friendships that lasted a lifetime. Wish I had known Mr. Harter – we could have shared many stories. My loss.
What a lovely memory. I just found out that Eugene was my grandfather’s cousin (my grandfather’s father was Gibson Harris, Maglin’s brother). My family emigrated to Americana and 14 years ago, I moved from Rio de Janeiro, where three generations of Harrises were born and raised, to the US. I have been living in DC since 2009. I wish I had known about Eugene then. I would have loved to meet him and his wife. I now have a daughter, who was born in the US. Our family has returned back to its roots 🙂

"Everybody gets so much information all day long that they lose their common sense." ~Gertrude Stein
A Jewish-American writer and poet who died in 1946, Stein was a mix of many talents and interests. She studied psychology under the eye of famous psychologist William James, embryology at The Marine Biological Laboratory, and then attended two years of medical school at Johns Hopkins.
Initially, Gertrude's fame came from her art collection of famous artist's works which she housed in Paris.
"Rose is a rose is a rose is a rose," is her line from a poem called Sacred Emily, and her famous book, Tender Buttons, is almost stream of consciousness--renown psychologist B. F. Skinner thought it was automatic handwriting!
Gertrude wrote for sound rather than sense, which brings us to "sense" in her quote. How could a woman of the early 20th century feel there is an overload of information? I don't know. Perhaps each generation feels the same and we aren't as different from past generations as we think!
Here is her Wiki Page and her Books. If you want to read Tender Buttons and see what B.F. Skinner was talking about, .go here It's an experience. :-)
That is a great quote. What would she think of our generation of information overload. I know I feel its effect.
I'm thinking texting, emailing, facebooking, and twittering would overload her into a coma. I Googled "television," and regular commercial programming didn't begin until 1948, so TV wasn't a factor in her overwhelmed feelings. I wonder what the factors were? Too many newspapers? :D
There's a lot of serenity in my life. I'm blessed by a great deal of work to do, challenges to meet, family and friends to support.
This means I have to be active a lot and do a lot of things I don't want to do, and deal with difficult people like my wife and children and friends and co-workers.
So my plate is full and I'm under a lot of pressure: financial pressure, pressure of relationships, pressure at work.
Technically speaking I should not feel serene at all. So I've been trying to figure out just how, and just why, I can have a hands-down, yell-at-each-other fight with another person and still feel pretty darn terrific inside... and not even really be mad at them. How I can be under tremendous pressure at the office, with certain situations absolutely melting down, and yet still feel that life is... well.. fundamentally OK.
Certainly a large part of it comes from working to form a support structure inside- which is very different than the external structures I discussed yesterday.
After all, an inner structure, if it's sound, can be far more durable than an outer one. It has a resilience born of the fact that it's built out of my natural parts: not ersatz mental concepts I imported from books about psychology or architecture or even my various esoteric disciplines. It's tangible and immediate and more practical than that. It's built out of breathing and digesting and eliminating. Out of loving and thinking and exercising. These are pretty durable qualities.
So part of this improbable serenity is the inner support structure, all right. But perhaps more important than that is what the inner support structure connects to. That's much more subtle. And it's up to each seeker to discover that for themselves, because the reflection of one's inner gems cannot be put into words. Collectively they call on something much more essential- and expansive- than the corner my personality usually backs me into.
Serenity may be felt by the emotions, expressed by a quality of mind, and sensed by a relaxation of the body, but it's born of seeing the rich pasture of relationships within my organism, and seeing the relationship of the organism to life.
Within this pasture, gratiutude arises. I see that my wish is to become ever less of a warrior and ever more of a farmer. To take those swords of my negativity and not beat-but coax- them into plowshares of support and compassion.
It's no fun hacking people up, anyway. Competition does not serve- it demands. Some people never seem to get tired of it, but I for one am increasingly worn out. Sure- I can, and will, play that role as long as it's demanded, but, as the ineffable Mr. Gurdjieff once put it,

I had a short 3 day trip to San Francisco recently and I took only a backpack as my carry on. Other than clothes (including undergarments and socks), I’m sharing my carry on necessities. In order to keep my liquids TSA-approved, I took all sample or mini sizes.
As for my gadgets, I always travel with my kindle, my ipod nano to play music, and an external charger. This charger can charge my Samsung S7 at least twice before I have to recharge!
One thing I wish I had brought was this phone mount. It snaps into the car’s air vent so you can easily view your phone, especially when you’re using your phone as a GPS. I really wished I had brought mine for our rental car in San Francisco!
In the Dominican Republic anybody can easily land in jail for the simplest of crimes and the system is sometimes used by the government and police officials to punish people for personal vendettas. By some estimates 80% of prisoners in jail have not yet been sentenced. Many have no arrest records since they have been sent there by powerful people and on a notice even the President can send somebody to jail without a warrant. The disparities and inequalities of the Dominican jail system are many and in this country you could easily spend 10 years for stealing an egg or spend only days for murder, depending on who you are. In the Dominican Republic who you know is the ticket out of any situation. If you have committed a crime in the Dominican Republic, or have been arrested on a whim, for no real purpose, calling friends in high places. Usually, with a phone call from a friend who is a politician, a known businessman, a high ranking police officer or military personnel or someone who has a lot of connections will get you out of trouble. Only if the crime you are being charged with is related to drugs will you not receive any help.
Once you have been arrested you are taken to the Palacio De Justicia, Palacio de La Policia and or local police station jails where you can spend at most 15 days in interrogation with the Juez de Instruccion, though with deep pockets this can be avoided. Once the judge classifies your case to criminal or penal, then you are sent to formal jails to wait for your day in court. Upon arrest you are fingerprinted and photographed, but with a good bribe you can avoid having this done and you can end up in jail though your police file would not exist. This is why many prisoners are lost in the system. After release you can buy off your police file for barely $500 pesos. Torture is part of the menu at many police stations, where the hardest criminals land first. But you can easily get loose if you have heavy bribe money. The best way to get out is thru direct bribes to the judges and district attorneys, or even government officials connected with jails.
A "no a lugar" or discharge can be bought from almost any judge. Corruption in the jail and judicial systems in the Dominican Republic are rampant and drug dealers, thieve and white collar criminals have almost a free pass to what they feel, as long as they have the money to get themselves out of trouble. Discharges, depending on the particular crime, can range from US$10,000 and up, though lesser crimes can demand much less. “Bag men” are used to collect the money, which in addition is spread among district attorneys so they don't appeal the discharge.
Cell phones with monthly fees can be obtained for $2000-$3000 a month. The lines are stolen from government offices systems which are never checked for counterfeit use and the bills are paid without monitoring. However, many private cell phone lines are tapped by Najayo hackers. Shares were also sold, including to people outside jail. The cell minute is sold for as much as $25 a minute and cell phone couriers walk around the hallways selling cell minutes to inmates. Prisoners also get calling card numbers from family members outside if they are able to bring their own cell phone.
Once you arrive in a jail like Najayo, money is your ticket to health and safety. If you have it, spend it well. The first thing you have to do is to purchase a "Goleta" or makeshift-jail-cell and special privileges which are sold like products. Goletas are sold like real estate. There are luxury suites, like the ones at "las conyugales", "especiales" or "los veteranos" cells. The conyugales are for up to 4 prisoners (you have to take turns to have sex with your partners). “Las especiales” can be individualized, just like los veteranos, and turned into small palaces with oriental rugs, mirrored walls, air conditioned, electric plants, direct connections with the electric company, TV, radio, fans and king-size beds. There is a jail furniture maker that sells pine drawer type beds for $4000 and up or you can bring your own. To bring your own furniture you have to pay a bribe to the warden for every item. For instance, to "import" a TV you may pay up to $1000 pesos and a fan could cost you around $300. You can connect into a private electric network if you have $1000. Owning a Goleta is as good as buying true real estate. Upon release, you can sell it with its improvements and increase in value. You can also buy several units and rent them for as much as $1000 a week. A small token has to be paid to the warden from your earnings. Open goletas can be purchased. These are built directly into the walls, like benches. Goletas are painted in colorful designs. Some are duplexes with two floors. Your goleta is totally private and you can bring you wife, girlfriend or import girls from local whore houses and spend as much as 4 hours in intimate privacy.
If you have money, "llaveros" can bring you women from the women's prison. There are many foreign women, most in for drug charges. There are private visits on Fridays to the women's jail and to assure you a sure date just bring a plastic chair. This will help you sit a woman prisoner in your lap, lift her skirt and have sex with her without the guards bothering you. But, this to will cost you and you must pay $100 for the right to go to these parties.
If you have read the iPad versus MacBook experiment post you would know that one of the objectives of the whole experiment was to see if I could use the iPad as a replacement for my laptop. Well, in short, I did actually manage it, albeit with a few restrictions.
I will start off by saying that whilst you can use your iPad for most things, there are a few things that are much easier on a proper computer. The biggest issue with the iPad for me was simply the user interface. It's great for most things but when you want to type there is nothing like a real keyboard. This is no big issue as you can use the standard apple bluetooth keyboard which works flawlessly. However, this leads not to another issue. There is no mouse.

In the era of the Green Economy, San Polo is one of the most innovative and experimental wineries in Montalcino, founded on principles of eco-sustainability, green architecture and social responsibility.
The winery at Podernovi, built mostly underground, fits seamlessly into the surrounding landscape, and uses a sophisticated thermo-hydraulic system which ensures that the temperature and humidity of the winery are controlled in a natural way.
The same care is taken at every stage of the production process in the quest for the highest possible quality with minimal environmental impact: from vineyards to winemaking, from bottling to packaging, every operation is geared towards respect for nature and the consumer.
For this reason, in 2013 San Polo received CasaClima Wine certification, a seal of quality established to quantify and communicate the efforts of wineries towards greater sustainability. Organic viticultural protocols have been in use since 2014, and in 2017, San Polo obtained official organic viticulture certification.
I wasn’t going to cover up the statue of the Young People Sitting, this time. They are in the epicenter of the biggest outdoor gathering on New Year's Eve at midnight, with bonfires and the occasional graffiti, mostly on the bridge itself (ugh!), but sometimes the statues are vandalized too. As the day progressed, I had second thoughts, and stopped by my friends on the bridge corner, to say hello. And I knew I had to act. But what to do? These guys are bigger than you think, wrapping them takes a certain quantity of... something.
Meanwhile, across the street on the other bridge corner, someone forgot to clean up after themselves, leaving behind a shitty, collapsed pavilion. I have been passing this garbage for the past week, cursing the offenders. Ugh. Or. Wait a minute....
Tarpaulin.... cover... bingo! I peeled it off, and dragged it across the street, and within minutes, my friends were covered up, to the degree of being invisible.
If you only knew how happy I feel right now. This is definitely better than nothing. I’ll stop by and tie it up later. Fingers crossed that it works.
This year’s jule greeting is courtesy of the Nile decorator. Is it one person, or more? Either way, if you are decorating the Nile, you are the Nile decorator to me. It has been a while since the kids were pimped, I am happy to se this particular tradition kept alive (here's a look at the elf version 2012, compare this to our current ten plus degrees, whoa).
The tradition of adding little things to our statues, like flowers and costumes are a token of love and appreciation. Classic Copenhagen.
Something is different this time: jul is no longer painful. I think we have finally made friends. Clue number one was a couple of weeks ago, when I salvaged a tiny potted Christmas tree that someone had thrown out. Then, I went out and bought it a tiny elf, to keep it company. They are sitting in my kitchen window, reminding me how far we have come.
Actually, it is hard to believe it is even the 23rd of December today. The temperatures are more like fall, and some trees even still have leaves, nature must be so frustrated. It would be cosy with snow, but I am relieved that they are not salting everything to death. It's one less thing to worry about.
Up on the bridge corner, the Christmas tree seller is back in business, stacking them so close that you almost get the feeling of being in a small forest.
The cosiest part of this season is not how they decorate the shopping streets, but the little non-profit surprises popping up here and there. Like this initiative by the prison fence, encouraging you to leave a greeting for the inmates.
As I took these pictures, a woman in an SUV came racing around the corner, bumping into a pedestrian. He smacked his hands on the hood and let out a loud yell, but fortunately he was alright (a child might not have been, though). Proving the urgent need for this sign.
I found one more cosy greeting from the streets, but I am saving it for tomorrow. For now, rest your eyes on my new friends, the tiny rescued jule tree and the armless elf.
A couple of weeks ago, our mayor made a proud update to his social media accounts, of the selection and felling of a beautiful old fir, from the forest. We are talking eight tonnes worth of magnificent tree, cut off to decorate a square for a month. Heartbreaking. I know that I am peeing on the parade here, and it is not my intention to hurt anyone’s feelings, but can’t we try and figure out a less destructive way to celebrate this season?
It turns out, we can. In Enghaveparken on Vesterbro a new Jule tradition is born: The people of Flydende By (Floating City) built the coolest Juletree out of salvaged bike wheels. They call it a Hjuletræ (a wheel tree), which in Danish is pronounced almost the same as jul (Christmas). In their own words they hope to inspire Vesterbro to appreciate the value of recycling and creating sustainable and beautiful environments together.
It lights up too, if you push the pedals on the attached bikes. I should have brought the staff, dammit.
Discarded spray cans are used for lights. I had a playground mom help me out here, to give you an idea of the magic:
The bike parts are donated by Buddha Bikes, who collect, recycle and restore abandoned bikes found in the city. The pedal powered Christmas tree is around until December 29th, after which it will be taken apart, and the pieces used for other projects.
Maybe I will have to round up a few friends, and have them work the pedals, for the perfect shoot? Any volunteers?

Kurzfassung auf Englisch: Zimmermann-Laband syndrome (ZLS) is a rare disorder characterized by coarse facial appearance including bulbous nose, thickened lips, thick and floppy ears, gingival hypertrophy, aplasia or dysplasia of hand- and toenails as well as the terminal phalanges, and hyperextensibility of joints. Autosomal dominant inheritance has been suggested, however, the genetic basis of ZLS is unknown. Two apparently balanced translocations in patients with ZLS, a familial 3;8 translocation in both mother and daughter and a 3;17 translocation in a male patient, were investigated. Delineation of both chromosome 3 breakpoints revealed that the CACNA2D3 gene in 3p14.3 was disrupted by one breakpoint whereas the other one mapped 100 kb downstream of CACNA2D3, strongly suggesting that the ZLS gene is located in this region. Subsequent mutation analysis of CACNA2D3 in 20 patients with ZLS or overlaping phenotypes did not reveal any pathogenic mutation. As it can not yet be exclude that both breakpoints cause a position effect by disrupting the disease gene from cis-acting regulatory elements, another 9 genes (CHDH, IL17RB, ACTR8, SELK, LRTM1, WNT5A, ERC2, CCDC66, and C3orf63) surrounding both breakpoints were also analysed for pathogenic mutations in these patients.
Wnt5a is expressed at the digit tips of mice. It is known that genes involved in early development show a tightly regulated temporal and spatial expression which is controlled by regulatory elements located far away from the gene. Therefore mutation analysis was also performed for 9 highly conserved non-genic sequences (CNGs), which were identified by inter species comparative sequence analysis, and that are located up to 1 Mb distal from the 3’ end of WNT5A.
To elucidate whether altered expression of genes located in the 3p21.1-p14.3 breakpointregion is causative for ZLS, real-time PCR analysis was performed for seven ZLS patients for whom a lymphoblastoid cell line was available. Disease associated expressionlevels could not be detected.
Since pathogenic mutations in the region 3p21.1-p14.3 as basis of ZLS in individuals without chromosomal rearrangement could not be proven, the underlying genetic defect still has to be discovered.
Veselina Feldman proposes a modern innovative therapy – Equine-Assisted Therapy - for improving functioning and quality of life for children with disabilities.
In Bulgaria, children with disabilities and their families have lower quality of life. They often lack access to contemporary and innovative treatments, and professionals who work with these children do not receive specialized training. As a result, children with disabilities face even more barriers to developing their full potential. Instead, they remain isolated, stigmatized, and hidden from society. By not helping them achieve independence and self-sufficiency, the Bulgarian society is losing a valuable resource.
Veselina Feldman has been implementing and promoting an innovative equine-assisted therapy for children with disabilities. This therapy is based on using contact with the horse to achieve positive psychological effects and development. Veselina is offering the therapy to children between 3-18 years old in individual and group sessions.

Many thanks to Laura and Ryan, National Trust Rangers at Helston’s Penrose Estate, for giving us the chance to use the gorgeous Shadywalk Wood for our Design and Technology project today. Using only natural resources, Lerryn designed and built homes with three criteria in mind. We considered keeping the house free from wind and rain, making it strong and creating a space large enough for the small group of 3 or 4 children. The designs were superb and the judging was very close.It was a day of excellent learning and I look forward to the writing the the class create. Thanks also to Mrs Moyle, Mr Blackburn, Louise, Hayley, Kerry and Sandra for helping to make the educational visit happen.

All television in the UK will be transmitted in a digital format once the ‘digital switchover’ is complete in 2012. There is help available, if you need it, to upgrade to digital TV.
The government has set up a help scheme to make sure that everybody will be ready for the switch to digital TV. The help scheme will give assistance to convert one TV set, including:
The scheme is open to people aged 75 years and over, people who are registered blind or partially sighted, people who receive Disability Living Allowance or Attendance Allowance, and people who have been resident in a care home for more than six months.
If you are eligible for help, you will be sent more information well before your region goes digital. You will receive details of how the scheme works and what digital television options there are.
The provision is free for eligible households on very low incomes, that is those on Income Support, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, income-related Employment and Support Allowance or Pension Credit. Other eligible households will need to pay a subsidised one-off fee of £40.
The scheme is funded by the BBC through the licence fee. While the BBC is responsible for delivering the scheme, day-to-day operation is contracted out.
On most digital products, subtitling can be selected simply by pressing a key. Signing services are also becoming available on more programmes. On digital TV, signing can be carried on a separate channel in the same way that subtitles work. It then becomes an option to turn on or off.
Audio description is an additional soundtrack carried on programmes during gaps in dialogue to describe changes taking place on screen. The description can be carried on the same channel as the original programme, or it can be broadcast on a separate sound channel.

What's the first thing which springs to mind when somebody asks you about Pakistan? Chances are it'll be Taliban, bombs and other nasty business. People who know a little bit more about the region might talk about long standing conflicts and the need for military escorts. Bearing this in mind we wouldn't have been surprised to find grim and nasty people there. The Pakistan we found is very different then what's portrayed in the news though. For starters we found them extremely friendly people, even at customs and immigration. Add to that landscapes like we had never seen before and an unbelievable enthusiasm for our trip and we were in for a treat!
The road from the Kunjerab pass into Pakistan, which is a whopping 4,700 mtr high, is definitely one of the best we have ever been on. One of those places where we just kept taking photos. It's unbelievably stunning and not at all what I had expected to find in Pakistan. The road was beautiful, not just the scenery but also the road surface itself. We were lucky too, with an abundance in snowfall to complement the picture.
Being this high into the mountains, at the highest international border crossing, and being surrounded by snow made it so much more real. Riding this road in the middle of summer would be great too of course but being here end August / early September in cold conditions added that extra dimension. Having just been through the Chinese border process, with its nasty officials and their appalling behaviour towards visitors, the Pakistani officials couldn't have been more different. We were treated as fellow human beings again! Their friendly and helpful attitude was very welcome indeed.
It was also an easy border crossing. Passports were being checked when we had just left China, to see if we all had a visa for Pakistan, and that was it. The actual Immigration and Customs are in Sost, where the first ATM and petrol can be found too. Again the officials were very friendly, even asking what we as foreigners, would like to see changed in the procedure!?!? The only thing we could think of was a sign just after the border that we had to ride on the left hand side! The procedure was easy, all we had to do is fill in a medical declaration, show our visa and we were in. Then the Carnet de Passage had to be checked and stamped in the next building... and that was it! Welcome to Pakistan!
The strange thing is that we had all talked about riding on the left hand side of the road that morning, yet when we had crossed the border, we all kept just riding on the right hand side of the road. Maybe it was the happy feeling of being free from the Chinese, or just the total amazement of the landscape we had found ourselves in. Whatever it was, the poor Pakistan minivan driver coming from the other side must have had a heart attack when he saw the first bike coming around the corner on the wrong side of the road.... which was Eric's big BMW 1200GSA, followed by three Suzuki's around the next corner and finally us two around the next corner again.
Sost also is the place to fill up with fuel, as I was to find out later when the promised fuel stop further on at Passu didn't exist anymore. We did get cash out of the ATM in Sost though. For some reason our European Maestro bank card, which has supposedly world coverage, didn't work. The Australian visa card did. When's the last time you took 45,000 out of an ATM machine? As the value of the Pakistan Rupee isn't that high we did :-) It worked out at roughly 450 dollars.
Another beautiful ride followed where we were all taking quite a few photos. One of the group had been given a contact name for a good and cheap hotel in Passu, we found 3 but not the one we were after. As the last one we stopped at offered a room for just 12 dollars for two persons and a curry meal for just 18 dollars for the whole group, we decided to stay. The rooms were very simple and basic, we hadn't expected anything else, but it suited us just fine. We don't need TV or tiles in the bathroom and flushing the toilet with a bucket is fine too. The curry we were given was very good!
Despite China being beautiful and us both being glad we had been there, there was also very much a feeling of freedom and happiness now that we had entered Pakistan. China is an amazing country, no doubt about it, and one we would have loved to spend a lot more time in. But at the same time the vile behaviour of the Chinese civil servants, their unpleasant and at times downright appalling attitude was something we were glad to be rid of. Just across the border into Pakistan we found happy people, friendly faces, enthusiasm and like I said earlier: freedom.
Having a very good Pakistan curry together we talked about the beautiful day we just had, and made plans to stay around the area a bit longer to explore a couple of routes to a nearby valley and glacier. First thing we had to do though was get some fuel... and as we were about to find out, we should have had the tanks filled up at Sost...! More on which in the next post.

News story: Millions awarded to defence firms leading fight for modern battlefield November 12, 2018
Defence firms with cutting-edge ideas ranging from laser radars to Artificial Intelligence have been awarded over £10 million after being named winners of the MOD and Defence Growth Partnership (DGP) Innovation Challenge by Defence Minister Stuart Andrew.
Businesses around the UK are being urged to make use of a £2500 voucher for gigabit broadband speeds before the scheme closes due to high demand.
New York City was the second-largest city in the world in the advent of the 20th century, with the majority of its 3.4 million people living in Manhattan and much fewer people living in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Queens. Public transportation of the time-electric omnibus, gasoline powered trolleys and elevated railways-was inadequate for getting people where they needed to go quickly and efficiently. It could take hours just to get from Wall Street to Harlem in the days when Greenwich Village was considered a suburb.
The idea of an underground subway system had been discussed by politicians for decades, and finally it was decided in 1900 that a subway would be built. Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) won the job after its bid of $35 million was accepted.
The job consisted of building 21 miles of tunnels and 58 miles of tracks. Of that, 46 ½ miles were to be built underground and 11 ½ miles were to be elevated. Additionally, there were to be 43 local stations, five express stations and ten station elevators. All this was expected to be completed in only four and a half years. The contractor also agreed that he was responsible for any damage done to existing buildings and traffic would not be affected by construction.
Ground was broken in March 1900 in Manhattan. The construction company chose shallow cut and cover as the excavation method to avoid having to tunnel deep under New York's infrastructure. Wooden planking and bridges covered the construction so that traffic could continue over the tunneling that would go on for years.
Five different types of construction were used in building the subway: flat roof and I-beams for the roof and sides, supported by steel bulb-angle columns was used on 52% of the roads; reinforced concrete roof was used on Lennox Avenue and in Battery Park; concrete lined tunnel on 23% of the road; elevated road on steel viaduct was used on 24% of the road; and cast-iron tubes were used under the Harlem and East Rivers.
The construction that was typical for the majority of the project was a flat roof I-beam construction with a concrete bottom. The side walls had I-beam columns five feet apart, with vertical concrete arches between the columns. The I-beams supported the masonry, allowing the walls to be built thinner than they could have been if concrete alone was used. The tops of the wall columns were connected by roof beams, supported by rows of steel columns between the tracks. They were built on concrete and cut stone bases. Because the tunnels were susceptible to water damage from the ground, several inches of felt washed with hot asphalt were laid behind the walls, over the roof and under the floor. In some places, this method of waterproofing was reinforced with one or two courses of brick. Terra cotta ducts for the electric cables were placed between the steel columns and waterproofing.
The station on 42nd Street between Park Avenue and Madison Avenue required a special method of construction. Five subway tracks passed through this area, and the excavation reached a depth of 35 feet and extended 15 feet into the rock. In order to construct this segment of the subway, a 30-foot wide trench had to be sunk on the south side of the street, in which the subway was built for the width of two tracks. At 50-foot intervals tunnels had to be driven toward the north side of the street, with tops four feet above the roof of the subway and bottoms on the roof. The ends of the tunnels were connected by a parallel tunnel just beyond the line of the fourth track. Workers were then able to excavate the rock in the bottom of the tunnels to their final depth. A bed of concrete was then placed in the parallel tunnel, and a third row of steel columns was erected in order to support the concrete and steel roof.
In order to complete the tunnel for a width of four tracks, the construction company excavated the earth between the tunnels, with poling boards and struts supporting the material above. In this way, workers were able to extend the roof of the subway sideways over the rock below. The rock beneath was excavated when the roof was finished. The fifth track was completed by tunneling to the limits of the subway and blasting out the rock below.
The contractors decided that using reinforced concrete instead of steel roof beams in certain places would work better. The rods were 1 ¼ inches square, and laid out from six to ten inches apart, depending on the roof loads in the different places. Layers of concrete were then laid over the rods so that the rods were imbedded. The same procedure was used on the sides of these tunnels as well.
The work was very difficult in many places because of the sewers, water and gas mains, steam pipes and electrical conduits. Work was particularly difficult where the tunnels passed close to the foundations of large buildings and other structures. For example, the subway passed directly under the Hotel Belmont at 42nd Street and Park Avenue. Construction workers had to use extra heavy steel girders and foundations in order to support both the hotel and the subway station there.
Another similar challenge was posed by the 75-foot tall, 700-ton Columbus Monument near the southwest entrance of Central Park. The subway would pass under the east side of the monument within three feet of its center, reducing a significant portion of the monument's support. In order to ensure the safety of the monument and the workers, a tunnel six feet wide and seven feet high was dug under the monument just outside the subway's wall line. Works put in a concrete bottom in order to support a row of wooden posts that would carry the footing above. When this was done, the tunnel was filled with masonry rubble, making a wall that was strong enough to support the monument during the subway's construction.
Problems arose not just from buildings above ground, but also from those below ground. At 42nd Street and Broadway, the pressroom of the new New York Times building was actually below the subway. The subway was built literally through the building, with the building's columns passing through a subway station. Workers used steel channels to brace the very tall building and ensure that it was not damaged.
Construction workers built the subway close to the surface in many places, and because of this many underground pipes and ducts had to be moved and reconstructed. For example, at the 66th Street station the roof of the subway was a mere two feet from the electric railway yokes and structures of the street surface line. Workers had to remove two large gas mains, build troughs between the subway roof beams and substitute in five smaller gas mains, all without interrupting the mains' use.
In the course of building the subway, the construction company created the second longest double-track rock tunnel in the United States. It runs from under Park Avenue to Lenox Avenue. Along the tunnel from 116th Street to 120th Street resides one of the widest concrete arches in the world, 37.5 feet wide. The two-track subway was created by tunneling through micaceous rock and removing top headings, all done from two shafts and one portal. Using percussion drills, the blasting of the headings was done by an eight-hour night shift. The spoils were removed in the morning and used to make the concrete that lined the tunnel.
Workers encountered trouble during the construction of the section on Park Avenue from 34th Street to 41st Street. The rock in this area was very slippery and on a steep incline. Although every precaution was taken, the surface above the east tunnel was disturbed and several houses were damaged. Workers used Portland cement grout to strengthen the affected area of the work space so that no further damage was done.
The contractors agreed that building the tubes that run under the Harlem River was the most interesting and exciting part of this project. The War Department required that the river have a minimum depth of 20 feet at low tide, so that set the elevation of the roof of the submerged part of the track. The track ran 1500 feet, including the approaches, and was lined in concrete. Workers had to tunnel under water through a bed of mud, silt and sand. Much of this material was so fluid that it had to be removed with a jet. Excavation of the tunnel went down 50 feet.
Because the War Department required that half of the river must always stay open, only one half of the tunnel could be built at a time. Workers dredged a trench over the tunnel line 50 feet wide, 39 feet below low water. They then drove three rows of piles on each side of the trench from the west bank to the middle of the river and built working platforms on them. Piles were driven over the area where the subway was to be built, over which a trussed framework was floated and sunk.
The roof was constructed of three courses of 12-inch timbers separated by 2-inch planks. This was also floated over the piles and sunk. When it was put into place, it was covered with earth and excavation could begin. Both air and water pressure were used to excavate. When excavation was complete, the piles were braced so that the concrete and cast-iron lining could be put into place. The piles were then cut off as the concrete bed was laid. The second half of the tunnel was constructed in a similar manner.
The subway system was completed and opened for business on October 27, 1904. The price to ride was a nickel and 150,000 stood in line to take a ride on the first subway train. New Yorkers applauded IRT's innovations, especially its use of electric power which added nothing to the city's air pollution. With a four-track design that could run in each direction at both local and express speeds, IRT had built the fastest public transportation system in the world. Its slogan: "City Hall to Harlem in 15 minutes!"
Neighborhoods sprung up around the planned subway stations and the population grew. In 1900 few people lived in Brooklyn, but by 1914 it was home to one million people. On Monday, December 23, 1946, 8,872,244 people rode the New York subway system, a record that still stands today.
Thanks to IRT, New York City flourished and developed into the city it is today because the subways enabled people to live in one area of the large city and work in another, with quick and efficient travel in between.
Since the subway was built, over 100 stations have been renovated, with many more planned. More than 1,000 new cars have been put into use, at a price of $2.4 billion - more than it cost to build the entire subway system itself. But renovations were not done by IRT. The company went bankrupt during the Depression and the city took it over.

Handyman December 23, 2015 Easy Construction construction services, general contractor, major construction services, Professional contractor, Professional Handyman
You hear horrible stories about the antics of general contractors and handyman services, but shouldn’t be put off making use of these convenient and sometimes vital services. The key to getting the right general contractor who provides the construction services you need is picking carefully at the beginning.
While letters after your name don’t necessarily stand for anything in terms of service, of course, it’s always good to know that a general contractor is a member of a national association and holds accreditation and standing in their eyes. A national association will generally take great care to weed out unprofessional handymen and hold their members to a certain code of ethics. That’s not all, however. Knowing the vital questions to ask before you speak to the handyman can be incredibly useful and help you make the right decision.
Remember to find out the vital information, such as whether they carry both general liability insurance and workman’s compensation. Lein waivers are a good thing, too. They act like a receipt to guarantee all suppliers and sub-contractors have been paid, meaning a lein can’t be placed on your property. You also need to determine whether the general contractor or you are responsible for gaining all necessary permits.
Get a sense for how many projects similar to yours the general contractor has done recently, as well as how much repeat business they generate. While people don’t usually have major construction services every year, the fact that firms or clients have come back to them for further work suggests that their work is worth the time and the cost. You should also establish whether your work has a warranty or not. Ask them for references, too. Most reputable firms will not have issues with providing these. Be sure to actually follow up on these references, however. Know if the job was done right, on time, and whether the contractor was reachable or not.read what the expert said at http://www.thespec.com/shopping-story/6193698-let-the-experts-at-handyman-connection-give-you-the-bathroom-you-ve-always-wanted/
Verbal quotes tie no one down. Be sure to get everything in writing. If plans are suggested, get them done properly- no one will take a sketch on the back of a beer mat seriously as evidence if you need it. While you should, of course, never judge a book by its cover, be sure to take some note of the look of business vehicles and the handyman themselves. A very dishevelled or run down business is not usually a good sign. Communication skills count too- they should be able to interact with you, be available and welcoming to questions, and listen to your needs.
Miscommunication leads to costly errors, as does a contractor who is not easy to get hold of or evasive about answering questions. Don’t be afraid to interview several handymen or general contractors to find a match who is compatible for your needs, reliable and will get the job you need doing done speedily and professionally.

As a psychologist and marriage and family therapist, I often see couples who are facing an emotional chasm in their relationship. The chasm does not develop overnight, but is usually the result of long-simmering, mutual frustration and resentment within the relationship. Resentment can grow from relational conflicts, disagreements or hurt feelings that go unaddressed or are dismissed by a partner; and it is toxic to a relationship. When a partner continues to bring up a past event, it usually signifies the existence of unresolved emotional business. One partner’s repetitiveness can be exceedingly frustrating to another, but the underlying message is, “I need to talk about this and I need you to hear me, even if you disagree with me,” or, “You hurt my feelings, and I need you to know and be remorseful about it.”
In my experience, one of the most frequent causes of resentment is that, when an issue is mentioned by one partner, the other grows angry and shuts down the conversation. Does this exist in your own relationship? Are there topics that you avoid from fear of bringing up anger, emotional escalation or creating emotional distance? Have your past attempts at resolving conflicts led to oneof you leaving the conversation, either by physically exiting the room or by stonewalling and emotional withdrawal?
Trying to avoid tense relational situations is an understandable desire. Sometimes a little time and refocusing on th epositives of a relationship can allow the conflict to heal itself. But when conflict and hurt feelings do not resolve naturally with time, you should consider addressing it with your partner. Imagine, if you will, your resentments piling up in the corner of your marital bedroom. Over time the pile of resentments takes up more and more space in your relationship and life. You probably don’t want to spend time ruminating on the wrongs you have suffered, as this only results in more of your time being spent feeling hurt.
What to do? Choose to engage differently with your partner. Face your fear and give your partner the benefit of the doubt that they also want you to be happy in the relationship. Remind yourself that you are confronting your fear in order to limit your resentment, and this courageous step is intimacy-enhancing. Some tips for introducing the topic in a conversation: take a gentle approach; admit that it is difficult to talk about; share that you continue to raise the issue because it feels unresolved; and ask your partner if or when is a good time to discuss the issue at hand.
For instance, say you are concerned your partner is drinking too much alcohol, and you worry that he or she may become intoxicated at a work or family party, causing potential embarrassment, personally and/or professionally. Past attempts at discussion have led to anger and defensivenessso you have chosen to avoid the topic. However, just because you don’t talk about it doesn’t mean the problem doesn’t exist—it’s growing larger in the resentment pile in the corner. Being willing to face the issue does not mean that you will resolve it amicably, but it does mean that you are prioritizing your relationship—you are trying to protect and strengthen it.
Your preamble to the conversation might go something like this: “I need to talk about an issue that concerns me. Please listen to me in full before you respond. I do not raise concerns about your drinking because I am trying to control you or criticize you, but because I care about your health.I fear you are drinking to excess more often than in the past. It scares me because of your health, because of the alcoholism in your family, and because I am concerned that you are struggling emotionally. I worry that you are drinking to dull a pain you don’t want to feel or to escape. I want to tell you what I see, think and feel, with the hope that you will take my concerns to heart.”
This gentle approach can be effective because it demonstrates concern over criticism and focuses on your feelings and observations (“I” Statements) rather than on your partner’s character (“You” Statements). For more help in processing any feelings of resentment or in bringing them up with a partner, you may want to schedule an appointment with a counselor. Decide to work through that pile of resentments for your own good and the good of the relationship.

Elite Singles has found that when you’re single- your favourite TV show can say a lot about you and what kind of dater you are.
You recognise that everyone has flaws so you are more lenient than others when it comes to your dates and often give them the benefit of the doubt. However you won’t put up with any Joffreys or Ramsays- you do draw the line at plain nasty folk. You enjoy learning but only when it’s presented in an exciting manner- so you’re not up for walking around museums- you like dates with more interaction.
You love a good laugh and you’re respected for being a tolerant person- especially of those who see the world a little differently to you. You don’t go off looks or stereotypes- you’re open to dating anyone who treats you well. You may not always have a lot in common with your dates but you often enjoy their company all the same.
You’re a thinker and don’t like your dates to give too much away too early. You enjoy slowly learning new things about them with every new meeting. In between your dates you spend time thinking about them and working out what sort of person they might be. Often your instincts are correct so you generally make good choices when it comes to people you spend your time with-resulting in positive relationships.
You appreciate the security of predictability and routine and anyone who upsets that sends you into a spin. You prefer to meet with someone who shares your sense of order and habit because it makes you feel safe and relaxed. You’re not opposed to a bit of drama- just as long as it’s someone else’s problem.
You are quite happy to mix things up when you’re dating- you will go to new places and enjoy new experiences with a partner who’s willing. It is difficult to describe you with one word because you have such depth and adaptiveness to your personality that you can fit in with most people in most places. But when it comes to good and evil- you can smell such singles a mile off and invest your time wisely with the right people.

Down From the Mountain: Live Concert Performances by the Artists & Musicians of O Brother, Where Art Thou?
"This CD is one of about 5 CDs that I listen to very frequently. Firstly, because I play jazz guitar and I love to her Pass play with absolute purity on each solo. Posthumously, Pass plays superbly and the CD is laid out very well. Starting with "There Will Never Be Another You" sure sets the stage. The CD captures Previn and Pass [literally] playing off each other's solos and one quickly discerns that there was much fun going on when these three jazz masters recorded it! Per usual, Ray Brown's freshness shined through and his remarkable sense of snagging the beat most creatively, enabled them to play without a drummer.Previn is known both as a classical player and jazz player. This CD evidences a man with almost surreal skill and aptitude while playing solos and too, playing sweet chordal progessions during Brown and Pass' solos! Get this CD and listen to it a few times. You will have listened to it 300 times by year's end! Awesmome summarily sums it up! Buy it!Respectfully, Brian G. Jett"
"For those looking to start a Jazz collection, this is hidden treasure. The album keeps a constant late-night mood throughout and the technical wizardry of Previn and Pass reinforces the quiet feel with some incredibly interesting and enjoyable music. The album ends wonderfully with "One for Bunz", so good that it makes me start the album over. Do yourself a favor and pick it up"
"Andre Previn, Joe Pass, and Ray Brown, three of the true giants of jazz and each a major solo artist, combine their talents on this recording session in milestone effort. The trio can swing without percussion and the combination seems to give them more leeway in rubato passages. I was empressed with the unselfishness and supportiveness of the three. Each solo to great effect but then are willing to play the accompianment role to perfection. I especially liked the Cotton Tail and What Am I Here For tracks. As a fan of all three artists I was overjoyed by this addition to my collection."
""After Hours" with Andre Previn, Ray Brown and Joe Pass is one of the best jazz CD's I have heard in a long time. It is entirely standards and Previn is sensational on piano. It was recorded almost with little rehearsal and thus is very spontaneous. Of course Brown and Pass are equal to Previn.
Because Previn is so versatile he is often overlooked as a great jazz pianist. This CD disproves any questions one may have about his remarkable ability.
"Let the professional reviewers analyze the album all they want, but this is trio jazz made up of three outstanding artists who created an album that any of us who like great music will love to listen to."

Snow City is the first permanent indoor snow centre in Singapore. Yes, our sunny Singapore now has real snow for everybody!
Being a tropical country, many Singaporeans have never had the opportunity to experience the cold (the lowest temperature ever recorded here was way back in 1934, when it hit a low of 19.4°C!!). Now that Snow City is here to stay, you now (Singaporeans, neighbouring countries or tourists) have the option of escaping from the hot and humid Singapore weather and experience a 'winter getaway', right here at your doorstep!!!
In our current lifestyle, most of us grow up in an environment where instructions regarding appropriate table manners range from relaxed to virtually nonexistent. Many young adults, raised on fast food, have become experts in the art of eating with their fingers. No matter what your lifestyle is, knowing proper table manners will come in handy when you have to “on” during a business luncheon, a power business breakfast, buffet or fine dining; be it in an Asian, Mediterranean or Continental setting.
Many deals are made over a meal table. Thus, it is imperative that we cultivate the right dining etiquette and social graces.
I am much gratified by Sheila's ability to transform me to a person to have a more magical personality after attending her first "top to toe" session in 2010 and another astounding session in 2014. I am now noticed by my bosses.

Written by admin	| December 11, 2015 | Comments Off on Some of The Pros And Cons Associated With Buying Electronic Cigarettes From Online Stores
When someone speaks about e-cigs, you will surely get to know about many benefits that are associated with it. However, just like any other things, electronic cigarette also has its own list of cons. So, what are the pros and cons that follow with buying electronic cigarettes from online stores? Here is a brief explanation.
No matter what your requirement might be, the important aspects that you should consider before buying anything from online stores include price, selection and knowledge.
Advantage: Buying online comes with the opportunity to select the right brand product, while you are planning to buy an electronic cigarette. The customer reviews will also help you know whether it is worth spending on any particular model or not.
Disadvantage: There will be multiple brand names that can put you in a state of confusion, while knowing what to look for. Sometimes, the reviews will be from the experienced executives working for that particular company.
Benefit: Online store will offer excellent discount on each product. It is obvious that you will be looking for the best quality product at affordable price. Hence, shopping here by purchasing coupon codes for v2 cigs will surely prove beneficial.
Drawback: The price as set for any e-cig might or might not include additional charges such as tax, vat, shipping and delivery charges, handling charges, etc.
Pro: With the availability of multiple options, you will get to enhance your knowledge about the available useful electronic cigarettes, which are recently introduced.
Looking for the best coffee in NYC, the freshest fish in New Orleans, a great little hotel in Paris or simply a romantic spot to watch the sunset in Florence? A new edition to swirl and savor, T3 offers a travel, food or wine related tip that you need to know about! Discovered during our adventures and travels, these are not paid endorsements but simply tried and true tips for inquisitive minds .
Castelvetrano Olives (nocellara del belice) – In the Belice Valley of northwest Sicily, olive-growing dates back to the 8th century BC and the Greek colonies. The flat, red soil and warm Mediterranean climate provide the perfect growing conditions for some of the best olives in the world. Castelvetranos are harvested young and cured in lightly salted brine, which accounts for their bright green hue and meaty texture. With a mild, nuanced flavor that's both salty and sweet, the fruit appeals not only to olive aficionados, but also to those who shy away from stronger, brinier varieties. I was very excited to find these deliciously plump, meaty olives on the Wholefoods olive bar when we returned from Sicily! If you can't find them, you can purchase them here at the swirl and savor store.

But when a Hollywood scout discovered her, and brought her and her family to MGM, a new name was suggested. The twins dominating mother, Mrs. Pierangeli, would have none of THAT. It was a proud name.
Besides, Anna had at 18 already costarred under her given name with the estimable actor-director Vittorio de Sica in an Italian film, 1950’s Tomorrow Is Too Late. So, what could be wrong with the name assigned to her at birth?
MGM execs explained it was just too long for movie marquees. Finally, a compromise. Her surname alone would be used as both her marquee names. And Pier Angeli was born. (Her sister would take the professional name Marisa Pavan.)
We should note that Pier Angeli’s life, both professional and offscreen, was short and unhappy. There were lost loves, and lost movie parts she intensely longed to play. She died at age 39 of her own hand, one of Hollywood’s legendary suicides.
At one time, though, she was regarded as an actress of real box office potential. The trade journal, Motion Picture Herald, did not name her “Star of Tomorrow” for nothing.
Ok, let’s test your Pier Angeli chops, and see how much you know about this fleeting Hollywood star. As usual questions today and answers tomorrow. Here we go:
1) Question: Pier Angeli’s most enduring Hollywood film, 1956’s Somebody Up There Likes Me, is a biopic about a boxer played in the movie by a popular leading man. Can you name this actor, and the real-life pugilist he portrayed?
2) Question: Angeli was famously married to which one of the following pop singers of the period? a) Fabian; b) Frankie Avalon; c) Vic Damone; or d) Perry Como.
3) Question: Angeli also had her share of notable lovers, a group that does NOT include which one of the following? a) Kirk Douglas; b) James Dean; c) Armando Travajoli; or d) Jean-Pierre Aumont.
4) Question: During a dark period during which she couldn’t find work, Angeli somewhat improbably became very close with which one of the following female stars? a) Joan Crawford; b) Jane Mansfield; c) Debbie Reynolds; or d) Rita Gam.
5) Question: How exactly did Angeli commit suicide? a) She listened one too many times to her then husband’s latest record album; b) Jumped off a tall building on the MGM lot; c) Overdosed on barbiturates after four previous suicide attempts; or d) Flung herself in front of heavy traffic on Sunset Boulevard.

This is a picture of Andrew during the West Jordan cook-off we ran. I think this is his first time to fall dead asleep in public. Lets just say that people were constantly walking past him and he stayed asleep, he was so tired!
This is at the rainforest cafe giftshop. He loved the animals because they are animated and make animal noises.
This is at FAO Schwartz. Dave decided that it was finally time to put Andrew where he belonged, with the monkeys!
Dave, Andrew, and I went on our first family vacation this weekend. We drove to Las Vegas. It was fun and a good learning experience for our up coming vacation to California. We arrived in Vegas at about 10 pm on Friday night and we went straight to Janet's house. She so kindly let us stay in her home while they are partying in Hawaii. We didn't do too much but we hit some of our favorites that we thought Andrew would like. We went to the M&M factory, saw the lions at the MGM, visited the Rainforest Cafe, and walked around New York, New York casino. We then went back to Janet's house and let Andrew take a nap. That evening we went the aquariums at Silverton Casino, to Ceasers Palace and got some cheesecake, visited FAO Schwartz, and then walked over to the Bellagio to watch the fountains. Andrew loved all the lights and could hardly take it all in. I have some way cute pictures, mostly of Andrew but much to my frustration, my camera will not download to the computer. I think I am going to have to reload the program onto the computer or something. Look for pictures soon.
Okay, there are bad days but when the perfect day comes along I just can't help but smile. Today was one of those days. When he woke up Dave brought him to me and sat him in the bed next to me while I slowly woke up. It was sooo nice not to nurse him right away. He then took a 1 1/2 hour nap in the morning and a 1 hour 45 minute nap in the afternoon. We ran errands in the middle of those naps and he supplied no complaints. When he was awake he just wanted to sit and play, he has even figured out how to "cover" his eyes himself to play peek-a-boo. Don't worry, I will get a video of it soon because it is just darling. To end the perfect day, I layed him down and Dave and I went to the backyard. When we came back in I made Dave check on him and he was still awake, as happy as could be playing with is blanket. Now here is the good part I haven't heard from him since. I love that boy!
Today is Dave and I's wedding anniversary. I can't believe that it has been three years. It has gone by so fast, but on the other hand I can't really remember not being married. I can't say that today was the best day in the book but in the end it turned out good. I gave Dave his presents last night, I am so bad at keeping secrets/surprises. I bought him two X-box games and a book. I think he liked them. I told him I want to take him shopping for a Braves hat too, but he needed to come with me because I have no idea what size his head is. This morning Dave went to work and I struggled to stay sane with Andrew, the no nap baby. Luckily I had a break in the day when Dave and I went to lunch. That is when Dave gave me half of my present. I asked for a pedicure, he went above and beyond by buying me a massage pedicure at the salon in Lehi. I have pretty bad RLS and I love to have my calves massaged. He then told me that he was going to by me "Eclipse" but since it came out today it was sold out at midnight every where. Yes, I know so far that the days seems to be going well, but this is were it falls apart. Dave goes back to work and a couple of hours later calls to tell me that our baby sitters have fallen through because they both had to work late (out of respect and love for these baby sitters they will remain nameless). Thank goodness for a good friend and old roommate, Jamie and Scott Winkler came through and watched Andrew. We had a great dinner and were able to do some shopping. A whirlwind weekend in Las Vegas will hopefully sum up this anniversary as a success!
Dave and I have been married since Aug 2004. We live in Saratoga Springs. Dave is a civil engineer and I am a stay at home mom to our little boy Andrew and our little girl Camille.

Last weekend, I took the kids camping ️ with the Cub Scouts while Jake stayed home doing homework. It’s always so fun with all the Scout little sisters and hot cocoa in the morning! But we could have done without the 5 a.m. sprinklers that soaked half the tents. For anyone keeping track (🏼‍♀️), that’s 3 weekends tent camping this month. Isn’t there some kind of medal for that? 🏅

Welcome to the wonderful world of hit exchange advertising. This is a great way for small business owners, opportunity seekers and website owners to get top quality traffic to their websites. It's a very simple concept, you will visit other members' websites and they will visit yours. The more sites you visit, the more website traffic you will receive!
Referring new members to DeepSpace Traffic is a powerful way to increase your cash and credits, without having to surf or purchase more traffic. When someone creates a new account from your referral link, you receive bonus credits, banners, and cash directly to your account. Then as they surf and use the DeepSpace traffic system, you will always receive a small percentage of every credit they earn... for life. So long as your account is active and your referral is active, you will earn new credits without lifting a finger. Now if you recruit a lot of new members to DeepSpace Traffic (i.e., build a downline) you can have a very significant source of traffic. On top of that, you not only receive credits for the new members you refer, but also for any new members that they refer, up to five levels deep. And you'll see your complete downline list on your referrals page. To build your downline, people must signup for new DeepSpace Traffic accounts directly from your referral link. You can obtain your referring URL by clicking on "Referrals" after logging in to your DeepSpace Traffic account. Advertise that link and you will start to build your downline.
If you hover over all the links and content in the surfbar a window will pop up and explain what its for. All the games and bonus pages have desciptions on it.

English, though born in Geneva, and brought up in Alexandria where his family had resided since the 1900's, Derek Flower received a cosmopolitan education at Italian, French and English schools in Egypt before going to Malvern College in England and completing his studies up at Oxford, where he received an honours degree in Modern Languages.
With the Suez crisis of 1956, he was forced to leave Egypt and his Lloyds of London brokerage business, and two years later settled in London with his wife Frédérique whom he had just married. There, he set up a property company specialising in overseas developments which later led him to move to the South of France and then to Italy where he also acted as financial consultant to British companies. He became involved too in the international crude oil and commodity markets, which gave him the experience on which he was subsequently able to draw for part of the background of his three generation saga FAREWELL ALEXANDRIA.
After many years spent in Gaiole in Chianti, he moved to Rome where he devotes his time almost exclusively to writing. His lifelong interest in Pharaonic Egypt, and in Alexandria in particular, led him to write THE SHORES OF WISDOM, a non-fiction story of the Ancient Library of Alexandria, the world's first great culture centre, from its foundation at the beginning of the 3rd century BC to its final destruction in 642 AD. This book has been published in Italy, Greece, the U.K., and Brazil, and a Japanese edition is about to be released.
Derek's novel BEYOND THE WHITE WALLS is a thriller centred around his former family home situated near ancient Memphis in Egypt, where he wintered until recently. Once again, this book is the fruit of his interest in Pharaonic Egypt and, though set in modern times, relates to the mysteries of the Pyramid Age.
Derek now lives with his wife Frédérique - chosen by Elle Magazine as France's most beautiful face and who has rendered into French some of his works - in the historic Villa Borghese where he is currently writing the 3rd part of The Tuscan Trilogy entitled The Twilight years.

In a field one summer’s day a Grasshopper was hopping about, chirping and singing to its heart’s content. An Ant walked by, grunting as he carried a plump kernel of corn.
Without stopping, the Ant replied “To our ant hill. This is the third kernel I have delivered today.”
The weather soon turned cold. All the food lying in the field was covered with a thick white blanket of snow that even the Grasshopper could not dig
He staggered to the ants’ hill and saw them handing out corn from the stores they had collected in the summer.
If we do not define our priorities and take the right actions, then later in life we may find ourselves facing adversities.

The 0.5 kg "Light" Clegg Hammer was developed for testing of softer materials such as turf or sand. (The reduction in mass provides greater sensitivity of the output.) The Light Clegg Hammer is the same diameter as the Standard Clegg Hammer and so the guide tube and Australian shipping case are also of the same design. The combined shipping weight is around 10 kg. The Light Clegg Hammer is raised by means of coaxial signal cable instead of the T-handle used on the Standard or other Hammers. Its standard drop-height is 30 cm and Australian supplied models come with a spacer that is located in the top of the guide tube to facilitate raising the hammer to a set height. Notation for the Light Clegg Hammer’s output at the fourth drop is known as CIV/L for "Light Clegg Impact Value" when dropped from its standard height of 30 cm, where the output is in Clegg units, i.e. where 1 Clegg unit equals 10 gravity units with the resulting decimal fraction truncated.
Here's a tip though - As you seem to find my 'usual drone' so offensive to your obviously delicate ears, mute the sound.
Just wanted to say... Simon (at Motodrome) is easy to deal with and very affable. I have met quite a few car dealers in my 57 years, and found him fair and professional in the one and only time I met him. He has a limited, but choice, selection of cars at any one time, and the prices asked seem to reflect typical dealer prices. There is often more going on than meets the eye when some make comments. Draw from that what you will.
hahaha; having ready the comments and abuse posted last time "Motodrome" made a guest appearance on the forum I wondered if my play on words would get another set of backlash from Simon Waller
...to be honest I've watch plenty of the eBay vehicles that Motordrome have for sale; and although the videos can be a bit "sky" "grass" "car" they do show what you need to know - and the detail in the listings is often well detailed - so can't argue with that.
Now there are a coupe of members vehicles for sale via a highly respected Business which has been established for many years; it would be great for people to see some positive and friendly comments from Motodrome rather than the rudeness shown so far; after all anyone wanting a 50th will at some point read back through posts.
The forum is for like minded enthusiasts - together we can help each other which benefits us all - even the businesses out there that we all need support from at time to time.
As I said, there is more than is known on here, so it might be better to let things slide, and they tend to go more smoothly if you do. Sorry to be cryptic. This forum has always been (in the years that I have been here) quite civilised, with virtually none of the back-biting that infects similar Defender forums. Let us not descend into that, please, and I'm positive James wants it that way.
Simon is a huge man, and quite able to defend himself, I'm positive of that! But I fear that if he comes on here to make any comment at all, he might be unfairly treated. Let's all talk to each other as though we would face to face (if only all forums were that way!)...and I doubt there are many on this forum who could actually face to face with Simon at his height
It's funny how, by responding to an apparently 'humorous' comment with an equally pithy one, it's transposed to 'rudeness', which certainly wasn't my intention, but I thank you for pointing out the typo in our description of GB089 (which to clarify, Motodrome own outright rather than selling it on behalf of a client).
That brings me on to another subject - for years Motodrome were ridiculed on this forum for asking high prices for 50ths, although generally these were achieved. I'm not going to claim any credit for the overall price increase though! But it's strange how some more vociferous members went a bit quiet in terms of high prices when we were asked to find new homes for their 50th's.
As Barry alludes, there was far more than met the eye to the previous spat on here a couple of months ago, but decorum prevents me from disclosing exactly what. Nevertheless I will always reserve the right to respond to blatant untruths about our stock and/or business practices, whoever that upsets.
I've been in this business now for nearly 30 years, and I'm afraid you can't survive that long by pulling the wool over people's eyes. Motodrome's business model is far from perfect, but I do strive for honesty and openness for both buyers, prospects, and sellers, which I'd like to think is more than some dealers can claim. Constructive criticism is always welcome as to how things might be better done, but nonsense isn't. I'm not sure why I should be seen to hold higher moral views than other members in terms of postings, but that seems to be the case.
Strange, on his web site he doesn't appear to have GB089 but has S90 CMD, looks tatty in pictures but sensibly priced at a fraction under £20K
It was advertised on pistonheads a couple of days earlier; in the ad were pictures of it in snow - and the advert mentioned that it was listed on pistonheads even before their own website motodrome.
Electronic meets craft in this fun joining of forces of Chibitronics and Deflecto. The only knowledge needed is how to build a simple circuit. Fear NOT all of the instructions are included in the Circuit Stickers Sketchbook, which is included in the STEM Starter Kit.
1. Create a simple circuit using copper tape provided in STEM Starter Kit, centering the circuit on the black part of the frame. I rigged my battery pack around the back so I can turn it on and off.
2. Space the chibi lights evenly around the frame making sure to keep ALL your positives on one side and negatives on the other than test the lights.
3 Create a black top for the frame by cutting a 5”x 7” hole in the center of a 7” x 9” piece of card stock. Center paper frame over and press against lights (this will emboss the paper a bit to help find light placement). Punch holes where the lights embossed the location.
4 Punch holes in the center of 14 ThermoWeb Foam Squares. Place these on black cardstock back centered on punched holes. Add a few more foam squares between light placements Peel away paper backing and place over lights.

RISE: Race The Future is a racing game set in a near future where a new kind of wheel technology will let you drift on all type of terrains and especially on water.
The unique gameplay defined as “precision drifting” will suit every player looking for technical and precise controls combined with the immediate fun and ease of an arcade game.
Natural environments are enriched and reimagined to create technical racetracks mixing multi-paths water zones and jumps. Inspired by retro arcade rally games the wide surfaces let the player enjoy long powerslides.
Players can master different techniques for overtaking and exiting a corner thanks to the combination of several boost systems which set the game appart from usual rally games.
The vehicle dynamics is based on realistic physics tweaked to enhance the player’s drifting ability. The result makes the handling extremely natural, smooth and precise for the most rewarding driving experience.
In addition to the arcade and championship mode, a challenge mode will let the player unlock the futuristic racing cars exclusively designed by Anthony Jannarelly.
Ensemble playing in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere, this workshop is aimed at moderate to good adult players who ideally offer two instruments and are able to swap between them.

Standing behind was an unusually attractive lady. She wore a dark blue, chiffon saree which set off her fair complexion even more. Other than a thin gold chain with a tear-drop pearl pendant on her neck, she wore no jewelery. Her lips were pale pink, with no lipstick. Only the dark make-up on her eyes made her look even more unfathomable.
Thus begins Coke, with this chance encounter at Kathmandu airport. But the plot thickens when the lady requests him to include her suitcase as part of his checked in baggage and then does a vanishing act, once the aircraft lands in Calcutta. What follows is a riveting page-turner, replete with unexpected twists as you encounter gangs warring over narcotics, policemen, functionaries, and a sinister master-mind who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. The furiously paced narrative takes you from the sleepy airport of Kathmandu to the packed streets of Calcutta, a mysterious mansion on the outskirts of town and an unforgettable chase-sequence through New Market.
From the author of the acclaimed Bengali novels ‘Kidnap’, ‘Shaaper Jhaanpi’ and ‘Robibar’ comes a high-octane thriller that’s seriously addictive and keeps you hooked till the end.
In so far as the pursuit of any true vocation is a life in itself, Barun Chanda – advertising guru, actor and writer, may be said to have had three. Born in Dhaka, he did his Masters in English at Jadavpur University. Following a brief stint as a lecturer in English, he embarked upon a career in the creative department of advertising that spanned more than 30 years, won him numerous awards and culminated in his tenure as Creative Director at Clarion McCann.
Acting occupies the second of his three worlds. In 1971, he scorched the big screen as a high-flying executive, playing the protagonist in Satyajit Ray’s ‘Seemabaddha’, and winning a special President of India Award for his performance. After a hiatus that lasted over two decades, he returned to the screen during the 90’s, and has since then acted in numerous TV series and more than 35 movies. Tackling Bollywood and Tollywood roles with equal aplomb, he has distinguished himself in films such as Lootera, Roy, Chotushkone, Aborto, MIshor Rohoshyo, Nayanchampa-r Dinraatri , Bela Sheshe and Jogajog. Chorabaali, where where once again he plays the protagonist, is his latest venture.
Barun’s third passion is writing. A regular film reviewer and contributor of articles to major dailies, in the last eight years he has published four highly acclaimed and successful novels in Bengali. His work has played a major role in establishing the adult thriller genre in Bengali literature.

The initial taxonomy here was published by Denis Lynn (2008) to genus, and then populated to species automatically from the Global Names project. Consequently, there are many synonyms, mis-spellings and other extraneous errors that have arisen. The intention is that ciliate taxonomists will adopt a section of interest (a genus or family, say) and curate the names that are shown there. This taxonomy, as presented, does not include any taxonomic judgement, other than Denis' down to genus level.
Curated taxa will be marked as 'valid' when a human taxonomist has assessed the nomenclature. Similarly, the citation data listed may not be linked to the bibliography as yet.
If you would like to be involved in this effort that should result is a comprehensive monograph on ciliate systematics, please contact the site maintainers to be registered as an Editor and given the authority to modify the taxonomy on this site. A second tier of editors will be created for students and others with a developing interest in ciliate systematics. These people will be supervised by an Editor and their changed confirmed before being committed to the available taxonomy.
If you contribute to the taxonomy on this site, your name will be associated with the taxa you curate. It is important to know that the taxonomic opinion shown to the world belongs to the taxonomist who took the decisions displayed on the screen.

In truth, early on Koum confessed to Acton (who experienced however to signal on like a co-founder) that he was thinking of supplying up and looking for your career. Acton advised Koum, “You’d be an idiot to Give up now. Give it some much more months.” [twelve] Because it turned out, Acton was right. It wasn’t long right up until Apple released press notifications, which Koum incorporated into WhatsApp. In the most recent incarnation, when users changed their statuses the application pinged everyone inside their network by way of thrust notification. Users liked this function a lot that they commenced utilizing the app to ping one another, at which point Koum realized he experienced inadvertently created a mobile instantaneous messenger. He describes, “Being in a position to achieve somebody [halfway] throughout the world instantly, on a device that is always with you, was powerful.” [12] Seizing this chance, Koum introduced WhatsApp 2.0 with a far more outstanding messaging performance, as well as the formerly lackluster user base quickly grew to 250,000—proving Acton right and permitting Koum know he was about the right keep track of.

The human metabolism is a finely tuned system operated and maintained in balance by various chemical reactions. Enzymes are the facilitators that catalyse the individual reactions. Defects and mutations cause dysregulations which also have consequences for the skin.
Acids and barrier lipids of the stratum corneum (horny layer) are the skin's first line of defence against infections. However, they also are the basis for a typical microbial colonisation (skin flora). The skin flora contains harmless but also facultative pathogenic germs. Peptide structures neutralise these pathogenic but also exogenous germs when they attempt to penetrate into the skin.
Peptides have become a topic of intense biochemical research since they control a multitude of regulatory functions in the body. Also the growth factors are an object of research since they regulate the development of young organisms and initiate repair mechanisms and healing processes in the later course of life. It's not surprising though that they are also in the focus of cosmetics.
Peptides play a major role in the development of anti aging cosmetics. They occur naturally and are quite often found as messenger proteins and hormones. Also their degradation products, i.e. the amino acids are key players in the field of cosmetic skin care.

This is my second time making these crab cakes. They taste good. In the past, I’ve used tofu to mimic the crab meat. When I saw a variation of this recipe using hearts of palm, I was intrigued. These cakes are easy to make. The part that takes the most time for me is shredding the hearts of palm to look like crab meat. From this recipe, you can make 4 large cakes or 8 mini cakes which I did yesterday. Next time, I will double the recipe because my family wanted more. The dish was completed with oven baked potato wedges, and sautéed tender young collards purchased fresh from the farmers market.
Add the chopped hearts of palm and sauté 5-7 minutes until golden brown. You can sprinkle with a dash of paprika to accelerate the browning process.
Remove from the skillet, add to the hearts of palm mixture, mix and add the Old Bay seasoning, flour and mayonnaise.
In a plate or shallow bowl, combine the bread crumbs and Old Bay seasoning. Coat the cakes with the bread crumb mixture and sprinkle each with paprika. Refrigerate for at least 10 minutes. This allows them to hold together well.
Heat 2 -3 TBSP oil in a skillet over medium high heat. Place each cake in the skillet and cook until golden brown on each side, approximately 2 minutes on each side. Watch to make sure they do not burn. Serve hot, topped with your favorite dressing, if you like.

AngularJs Directives are used on a DOM element like any attribute, name of the element, some css class or any comment. It tells AngularJS’s html compiler to attach any directive to DOM element. all data bind attributes with ng- are in-built directives like ng-app, ng-controller in angularjs.
Custom directives are those directives which have their own functions and run when DOM is compiled. If you want to reuse the lines of code in your application for different pages without repeating the lines of code in every place, in this case you can create a directive with that code in separate file and call that directive where that code is needed. This is the better way to understand code. These are the types of custom directives:
To use directive as an element you have to write element tag. If you want to use some code, then you just need to use that tag.
In the above example we have created a directive defined by myapp.directive. It is named as userReviews that is the element tag name used in html. user-reviews is different from userReviews because hyped in user-reviews is converted into camel case written as userReviews in javascript file. then it has a function which returns restrict: ‘E’ that means custom element directive and templateUrl that has the path of the code file inside element tag.

Major roof issues can cause aggravation for homeowners everywhere. To decrease the odds of needing major repair, take care of minor problems with your roofing before they escalate to huge ones. Properly caring for your roof means you have to give the right effort. Check out these roofing tips so that you’ll know how to maintain your roof properly.
If your roof is leaking in the rain, wait til it dries to fix it. Not only is there no way to quickly patch a leak, but your safety could be compromised on a slippery, wet roof. Once the roof has dried, you can set about making repairs.
Look at your roof closely once a year. Common seasons for roof damage are winter and spring. Therefore, make sure you pay attention to your roof at these times.
When roofing is concerned, safety should be your number one priority. It’s just too risky to get up on your roof during inclement weather, when accidents are most likely to occur. Put a bucket to catch the water until the rain stops, then get up on the roof to find the problem.
Do not try to do work on a roof in wet conditions. If the roof is slippery or wet, you may fall, resulting in a potentially major injury or even death. If you are doing your roof yourself, work on it when it is sunny and dry outside.
There are several important questions that one should ask a roofing contractor prior to the contract signing. For one, ask the amount of nails they normally use when placing a shingle. If it is three or fewer, that is a bad sign. Ask detailed questions regarding their methodology and ensure you are satisfied with their responses. If you have any doubt, find another contractor.
Wear shoes with rubber soles whenever you need to get on top of your roof. Although the weather may be perfect, your roof is still very slippery; therefore, you need these boots to ensure you have the best grip on your roof. Making your own roof repairs may require you to assume dangerous postures.
Before you hire a contractor for your roofing needs, make sure you do your homework. Don’t hire the cheapest or first company you locate. Instead, you should research all the roofers that are in the area. You may utilize online resources or seek recommendations from those you know and trust.
It is important that you check the references of any contractor you hire. When you speak with the referring individual, inquire about the quality of work and overall satisfaction. You should also go and check out some of their previous work. Take a quick drive and look at the work before making any decisions.
If your appointment with the roofer is scheduled, but is not to occur for a few more days, you may want to make a temporary leak repair. Buy some heavy plastic, and secure it with nails. Though this technique may not be most effective, it does the job for now.
Don’t attempt to create a temporary fix for your roof. It may not cost you a lot to do, but after a while it could cause more damage than it saves and that costs a lot of money. Fix any issues promptly and properly to ensure that the problem does not worsen down the line.
Make sure the roofing contractor you hire is trained and skilled. Talk to your family, friends, coworkers, etc. for suggestions on roofing contractors. Referrals can help you avoid getting an inferior roof installed, along with the cost and frustration of correcting the mistakes.
Make sure any roofer that you hire has the licensing necessary to do the work. If you don’t know what your area requires, you shouldn’t take what the roofer says about it as the truth. Instead, call your local building department to find out the necessary licenses.
Walking around on your roof looking for damage is not always safe. If you think your roof has problems, be sure to hire a professional to look at it. You don’t need to walk up there and have it cave in.
Look at the materials you have before you put on new shingles. Lots of leaks occur from improper materials, such as nails that are the wrong length or cracked shingles. Be sure those shingles are crack-free and strong, and make sure nails secure and penetrate the shingles to keep them in place.
Don’t install new shingles until you’ve gone over your roofing materials. Leaks can occur if sub-par materials are installed. Therefore, you should ensure your shingles have no cracks and that your nails are the proper length and size to completely secure your shingles.
To reduce the problems other homeowners face, you mustn’t forget about your roof. This can cause serious future issues. Try using what you’ve read to become a roofing expert. You can save a lot of trouble and money if you take good care of yours.
Always check a potential roofing company’s references. If the company is honest, they will not hesitate to provide them. If the company is dodgy about references, you should ditch them quickly. This might be a sign that the contractor isn’t a true professional.

A good roof protects you and your family from the dangers Mother Nature can throw at you. When you have some kind of a problem with your roof, you will find that nature can really do a number on your home. Understanding more about your roof and its care can help you out in the future. Review the advice that follows to ensure that you are ready for anything.
Check out your roof yearly. Winter and spring are the two seasons where your roof can become corrupt. This means it is important to pay extra attention during these times.
When repairing your roof, ensure you keep safety in mind. Repairing a roof in bad weather is a recipe for disaster. Just do what you can with the leak, like collecting the water in a bucket, and look at the roof later when the weather is better.
Check both the roof’s foundation and the shingles when you notice a leak. If your home is showing signs of dry rot, your house is vulnerable to water intrusion. Look at every entry point, even rotten wood, to see if the problem can be solved for good.
Do not try to do work on a roof in wet conditions. Slippery roofs can mean major falls. You can really injure yourself, or worse, you could die. If you’re making roof repairs, do it when it’s dry and sunny.
If you’re taking care of a leak, you need to make sure you fix it properly the first time around. So, you cannot stop inspecting once you find the initial issue. Be sure and inspect your entire roof to ensure that you don’t have a more widespread problem or additional leaks in other areas.
Consider your climate when roofing. Roofing materials made of clay work great when the climate is dry and they help cool down homes. But, in rainy areas, clay tiles can get worn down pretty quickly. If you have questions about this, you can inquire with a roofing professional.
There are some questions you need to ask the roofer before you hire him. For instance, see how many nails a given contractor uses for every shingle. Three nails usually doesn’t cut it. Question them about their methods and see if you get a satisfactory answer. If you cannot get a reasonable answer, find someone else.
When fixing a leak, it’s important to do the job right the first time around. Do not stop after fixing one small area. It’s easier to find and take care of all current and potential leaks at once, rather than have to repeat the repairs a few months down the road.
When you are looking into hiring a roofing contractor, check with family, friends and co-workers first. Inquire about the contractors they may have used and how the project proceeded as well as the general costs of such work. Also find out what kind of warranty their roofer gave and whether he cleaned up the job site.
Make sure that the roofer you hire has experience. You might try to get referrals from family and friends for good people. Hiring the wrong contractor can cause untold damages and distress.
When selecting roofers, verify their insurance coverage. If they have this kind of insurance, it is a good bet they are reliable. If something does happen, their insurance will cover the bills.
The age of your roof can help you figure out if replacement is needed. The average lifespan of a roof is about 20 years. If your current roof was installed over an old one, after twenty years you don’t have any other option besides replacing it.
If your appointment with the roofer is scheduled, but is not to occur for a few more days, you may want to make a temporary leak repair. Nailing heavy plastic to the area can help. This may be a somewhat inefficient method of handing leaks, but it can buy you some time.
Before you install a new roof, check out your supplies. Installation is a big cause of leaks, whether it be from the wrong sized nails or cracked shingles. Be sure that the nails and shingles are in good shape before you add them to your roof.
Only hire a roofing contractor that is able to supply you with proof of an active license and insurance. Do not hire them if they do not have this information. If they do poor work that can cause costly damages to your house, you have no recourse.
It’s not easy to keep a roof in great shape. By using the things you’ve gone over here, you shouldn’t have to deal with any trouble later. Use this new information to prepare, plan, and execute professional roof maintenance or hire a quality contractor.
Think about selecting architectural shingles for a roof replacement project. These are much better-looking than regular shingles and last longer, too. In addition, these shingles are highly sought by many buyers, and that means they can add value to your home when it comes time to consider resale.
Many people wish to become more knowledgeable about Handyman Kent, but they may not know how to do that. Thankfully, this piece has given you information to help you do it. Now you can put the various things that have been gone over here to good use.

By making an apparently unintentional death players may use explosives, or disguise the assassination. Wear their ensembles as a disguise, allowing the player to access limited places more readily and a common solution to approach an assignment would be to incapacitate other characters. Activities of non-playable characters help determine the sport. For example, players may get additional information regarding the place of the target through listening to some news reporter that is closeby.
Every episode in the game comes with a sandbox-kind surroundings which may be investigated by the player, featuring numerous methods to get rid of goals from injuries to scripted "chances" which need multiple jobs to perform.
A player's assignment performance review is rated on a 5 star rating system, determined by variables for example time taken, amount of non- targets if bodies were discovered or whether the player was seen, whether or not they've been recorded on camera. Players will be awarded by finishing challenges in an assignment with Command Points. Obtaining command points that are enough will get the player to earn a degree of Command Degree, using a total of 20 degrees. As the player advances through the 20 command levels, each degree will earn players new things including new gadgets for example new bureau pick-up places, various sorts of explosives and toxin, weapons, or new beginning places.
Being delivered consistently in downloadable form. This consists of time-small assignments called "Evasive Goals". If alarm the target and enable them to escape, or a person fails to assassinate an evasive goal prior to the assignment expires, the target isn't going to return. Successful conclusion of multiple targets afford cosmetic benefits for the player. "Escalation contracts", which are contracts produced by the programmers, contain multiple phases that demands the player to finish particular tasks including assassinating a target having a particular weapon or disguise or breaking right into a safe.
The escalation will be progressed through by finishing a phase, as well as the problem increases to the degree with new challenges new goals to assassinate or new developments. All added downloadable content after launch is likely to be free of charge. Hitman: Absolution's on-line Contracts style additionally returned in Hitman, enabling players to assign as much as five non-playable characters as assassination goals, establish conditions for share their contract to compete for high scores on, and the best way to kill them.

If it’s not one thing, it will always be another, because that’s the way things go… one thing leads to another... (yes, I can hear you singing that ’80s tune in your head now, and if you’re not, then you’ll click that link and go listen and get it stuck in your head and be mad at me for it! Ha!)…
But where my health is concerned, I believe that I have now researched, studied, watched videos, read about, and asked questions of doctors and literally been to dozens, if not more, doctors. I have actually been more knowledgeable about some of the medications the docs gave me and some of the conditions I’m dealing with than the doctors are. I feel almost like I’m getting a medical degree, not much different than the PAs and NPs I see at the teaching hospital clinic where I currently go. Sometimes, I have caught mistakes or interactions that were missed by docs. It’s proactive, but it’s sort of scary when you think that some patients take what doctors say as gospel truth and then don’t do the research or catch these mistakes. Docs are only human. Mistakes do happen.
However, recently, it’s sometimes tough for me to justify paying these doctors their, what I consider anyway, excessive fees, when I’m the one doing all the work. I come in with symptoms and they throw a test and a pill at me and don’t even give me a diagnosis and then expect that’s the end of it. I’m doing all the research, poring over my medical records, tring to find connections and pathways that lead to something that makes sense. When did doctors stop reading lab results, comparing that to symptoms, and researching conditions to make a diagnosis?
I am often lucky to get 15 minutes with a doc, maybe 5 minutes with the nurse, and then they throw a lab paperwork at me and a pill or new prescription or a sample at me, and tell me to follow up in X day/weeks, etc.
I’ve found that the specialists are a bit better at taking more time with me than their primary care counterparts. I get that. They deal with less flow through, their patients usually have been pinned down to having something related to their specialty, perhaps actually even have a diagnosis, so they can spend more time talking about symptoms and such. But that really hasn’t been the case with me, because there’s nothing that’s quite so cut and dry about my conditions. So I go to a specialist, he orders a test, we wait for the test, wait for the next appointment, and then we spend a few minutes talking about the test, get a med and get sent on my way, follow up in X days, weeks, whatever.
The last time this happened was with an endocrinologist. He gave me an ACTH stimulation test. The test showed my coritsol levels were low, I failed the stimulation test, so he put me on 30mg of hydrocortisone per day for coritcaladrenal insufficiency. We took my 24-hour urine test again after a month of treatment, and my cortisol levels were just the same as they were before he put my on the hydrocortisone. No change. No increase. So he changed to a different medication. Dexamethasone. You can read this post to see how the Dexamethasone affected me, but the short story of it is that it caused a steroid psychosis and I had to come off it. What did he do? He put me right back on the same 30mg dosage of hydrocortisone that I was on before — you know, the dosage that I just said wasn’t high enough and had had no result changes on my cortisol levels. This was in May. His office said to follow up with him in August.
So I’m supposed to go from May until August on a dose of hydrocortisone that we both knew from the lab results would not be enough, and that means I had all the symptoms of adrenal insufficiency–including going into shock on a couple of occassions–but I’m supposed to wait until August to see him.
Then there was the endocrinologist who took one look at me, an overweight, middle-aged woman, without looking at any lab tests, without ordering any lab tests, without even physically examining me and said, “There is no way you have adrenal insufficiency.”
Oh, you mean I wouldn’t be fat. That’s what he meant to say. He didn’t say it, but it’s true. He didn’t have to say it, but what I am amazed about is that he couldn’t figure out that, as a doctor, he should know that anorexia is not the same as anorexia nervosa and that a person can absolutely be overweight and still not be getting nutrition and metabolizing food and medication. This was the case with me. Food was not being metabolized, I was not getting nutrition from it, it wasn’t being burned for energy, so it was being stored as fat, with no nutritional benefit. I am anemic, vitamin B deficient, vitamin C deficient, calcium and sodium and potassium and magnesium deficient. The bloodwork said so. But he never bothered to pull those tests. He never bothered to look. All he saw was an overweight, middle-aged woman.
If one more doctor had told me I had fibromylagia, I was going to scream. I do not have fibromyalgia. Fibro doesn’t cause people to go into shock. Fibro doesn’t shut down the adrenal response. Fibro can be devestating to some people, but it’s not what I have. And in fact, I’m willing to bet that 90% of people out there with a fibro diagnosis probably aren’t even fibro. I would venture to guess they have a condition that their doctors are just too lazy or stupid to find.
But this same doctor said to me to stop taking the steroids. Steroids aren’t a drug you can just stop taking. You have to wean off them. I told him, “If I don’t have these problems, why is it the steroids make me feel better?”
He says, “Cocaine and meth make people feel better too, but that doesn’t mean their bodies are deficient in cocaine and meth.”
He the proceeded to tell me that he wouldn’t trust the ACTH stimulation test I took, the $500 test that I had to take for the one doctor that was only three weeks old at the time, and he said it wouldn’t be accurate because of my weight. Nice. So what did he do? he told me to stop taking the steroids and retake the ACTH test.
Wait a minute. A $500 test that is only three weeks old that he says he wouldn’t trust the results of anyway, but he wants me to redo it again? Why? He knew I didn’t have insurance.
Then I went to see my primary PA. She helps me. She listens to me sometimes and other times has to rush me out the door. She doesn’t, as far as I know, truly understand how awful my life can be right now. But at least she listens when I come in and tries. She throws a lot of pills at me, and I wish that weren’t the case. But she was the one who gave me high-dose steroids and that’s been the only thing that’s made me feel even moderately better in the past seven years.
But she’s limited to what she can do. She’s not a specialist. She can’t diagnose me with the things I’m dealing with. She can refer, but to whom? It’s just a broken, broken system.
So finally, a couple weeks ago, I woke and was unable to breathe. Every time I’d move, even a little, I’d lose my breath and have pain in my chest and feel like I was suffocating. I’d wake up feeling like I was suffocating. I couldn’t sleep well, couldn’t even walk to the bathroom and would literally be gasping for air like I was drowning. My pulse would go through the roof. My BP would go through the roof. My oxygen levels would plummet.
I go to the doctor with the symptoms, ask about what’s wrong, why it’s happening. Ask if I can get some oxygen so I can breathe… I’m put off for three days, with no help, no answer. Buffy calls the doc’s office each day, no response. She texts the PA who finally responds and says that her supervising doc says that she can’t treat me if I don’t go to the ER immediately.
It’s been three days since I’ve been in there. If it was an immediate ER situation, why did no one tell me? And what is up with the threat? I have been one of if not the most compliant patient they’ve probably ever had and lord knows I’ve spent plenty of damned money–mine and my family and friends who have helped me out– at their clinic, and she is going to fucking threaten me with stopping treatment for something that I was willing to do but no one had bothered to tell me to do, leaving me miserable at home waiting to hear from them for three days? Screw that!
So I went to the cardiologist, which leads to the point of the post: My heart is fine. Mild regurgitation of the mitral valve, mild congestive heart failure but no damage to the heart, mild pumonary hypertension. The cardiologist says the CHF is likely due to the hypoxia. That’s what’s making it hard for me to breathe. He prescribed supplemental oxygen, so now I use an oxygen concentrator, which keeps my sats up in the low 90s, and really helps a lot with being groggy and fuzzy and other problems that come from the hypoxia. It’s a pain in the tuchus to wear the mask and carry the cords around the house. I can’t leave the house either, ’cause we don’t have a portable o2 machine, and I can’t afford to buy one if this is going to be a temporary problem. So I’m stuck at home, unable to go anywhere and do anything, but that’s okay, ’cause I feel like snot and really don’t want to do much anyway.
I’m frustrated and nearly in tears writing this. I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve done everything I know to do. I’ve gone to the doctors, I’ve told them my symptoms, I’ve shown them the proof of what I can, explained what I can’t show, and I’ve gone to every follow up they’ve given me, every medication was taken perfectly… and I still don’t feel right. I still can’t do the things I want to do. I can’t even roll over in bed without my pulse ox dropping and my chest hurting and that’s WITH oxygen.
Then to top it all off, I’m sitting here today barely able to hold my head up, can’t sit up straight, can’t even get a good, solid breathe in, am choking on my food because I can’t swallow it… and social security tells me that according to their ‘evidence’, that my ‘daily activities are not as limited as you indicated.”
How’s that for the government calling me a liar? They literally said that my activities aren’t as limited as I indicated – and sadly, I thought that I was being light on how bad it really was in the report. Some days, I can’t get out of bed or even roll over, can’t lift my hands over my head, can’t even dress myself completely anymore and now I can’t even eat without worrying about choking… but my daily activities aren’t as limited as I indicated.
A few months ago, I had a few good weeks, really good weeks… where did they go? Why won’t they come back?
People seem to understand when you say cancer, or something serious like that, but what’s so interesting is that the DM I have actually kills more people who have it percentage-wise than all the blood cancers combined. There’s no awareness for it though. No parades, no ribbons, no fundraisers. Oh, but you don’t look sick… but oh, yes, I do. My body is dying… it’s giving up a little at a time and I’m doing everything I can to hold it together.
But it’s hard going to bed at night and wondering… Am I going to wake up in the morning? If I do wake up, how am I going to feel in the morning? Can I tolerate the pain one more day? Can I sit and look at myself in the mirror and see what I hate one more day?
And I do. Because there is no other choice. There is no other way. Because behind everything, I love my life, my family and my friends. I love who I am when I can be me, and I do come shining through in brief moments now and then. I miss me. I miss my life. I would do anything to have it back.
But for now, I have my family. People who love and care about me. People who help me. People who don’t pity me. I have my friends and the internet folks who love me and pray and care for me. I have hope. I really do. I have dreams and prayers and wishes for the future… and somehow, through it all, I know it’s all going to be okay.
Sleep Apnea has a couple of similarities as your condition. I was so confused when I suddenly began to gain weight. I was never a glutton, with the exception of a few meals that I absolutely had to have seconds (or thirds) of and the occasional holiday binge. I was working out, irregularly, but it was a pretty rigorous routine when I was at it. My job at the time was physical with lots of warehouse walking, heavy lifting, climbing…
My wife and I tried jogging around a park. I would run to the end of our road and back. I helped my father-in-law with winter wood. Random push-ups, jumping jacks, stair-climbing…
I would drop soda and other sugary drinks from my diet and would lose some fluid weight, eat lots of salads, cut back on other stuff that I wasn’t even abusing.
It’s amazing how quickly you can gain weight when your metabolism breaks down. Then you have to deal with the people around you. Worse are those people that you haven’t seen in a year or more…”Wow, you’ve gotten BIG!”
It’s likely that I am naturally an emotional/sensitive person. But when you are suffering from long-term sleep deprivation you have to deal with actual real-life depression. And having to deal with the additional self-loathing that jumps at your newly obese body every time you look into a mirror…
People begin to see an emotional wreck of a man who can’t control his eating, can’t stay awake at work, can’t get along with anyone, yells at his children and causes his wife emotional distress, can’t find any good in anything…
Then came the treatment. I began to put my life back together, made peace with my wife, got to know my children again. Found a job.
I’ve been on treatment for nearly a year. In the past five months I’ve finally began to lose weight…over 60 pounds gone.
Most people can’t understand it. It’s like you said, Cancer is something that people can understand. AIDS, Lou Garret’s, those are “real” problems. They make you weak, lose weight, fade away.
But it turns out that some sicknesses make you gain weight. And that is something that people can’t accept.
I don’t pity you. I’m sorry for you but I don’t feel sorry for you…if that makes sense. I envy the support you’ve found. All I had was a wife who was willing to stick it out with me a little bit longer than most women would have. Even now, only she understands it. She was there with me when I spoke to the doctors. She read the sleep test results. Was there when I picked up the machine that I have to possibly wear the rest of my life to sleep properly. Is there when I use it, lying next to me, listening to the machine push air down throat.
I don’t know what I would have done if I had needed long-term, financially-draining medical treatments. I don’t know who I could have turned to for that kind of help.
So I envy you for the support that you’ve found and I admire you’re courage and often wonder where you find the strength to keep going.
Michy is the personification of strength, courage, and optimism. Not matter how low you feel, you have to be optimistic to see all those doctors and deal with their expensive ignorance and rudeness.
Bukowski says, “What matters most is how you walk through the fire.” Grin it, bear it, don’t let it (or them) beat you. You are Jack Sparrow, scarcely armed, staring into the maw of a great beast, stealing yourself to leap past its teeth and down the depths of its throat into the dark pit of its stomach.
When the darkness engulfs you and all you have left is the fire and the sword, your courage will carry you to whatever end awaits.
Thank you, Gigahound, for expressing your thoughts so well. I am so pleased that you were able to obtain a diagnosis and treatment, finally. I’m sorry that you lost so much before you found your answers – but I am pleased you didn’t lose those things which were most precious.
Because of Michy, my sleep apnea was diagnosed and treated. Like you, I was experiencing clinical depression, metabolic shutdown, constant fatigue, and overall poor health until Michy pushed me to pursue the issues with my doctor (leading to a sleep study). I was dying by inches, literally.
I’ve had CPAP treatment for 7.5 months now. In addition, I am treating hypothyroid with dessicated thyroid, supporting my adrenal glands, changing my diet, increasing my exercise, and slowly weaning off of an antidepressant. It’s a slow process, but I am regaining my health, stamina, vitality, and peace. It allows me to help support Michy in her quest, now.
You’re right. Michy is brave. She’s also human, so sometimes she’s afraid or angry or uncertain… but somehow, the courage manages to win out. I truly admire that about her, also.

Is there a recommended Hail commit version? At the most basic, I’d like to load a VCF and run a logistic regression on dosage (or the DS format field). I’ve been able to compile and run Hail on Amazon’s EMR using commit version 1a0759237, but that version behaves differently than the databricks tutorial, for example mt.rows().select().show(5) shows an empty table, and I don’t get any plots when trying
I’ve tried compiling that version (f2b0dca9f506), but then it fails when trying to run mt.rows().select().show(5), as I recall, with a message like: Job aborted due to stage failure: Task 0 in stage 1.0 failed 4 times.
I tried compiling with Spark 2.3.0 but that doesn’t seem supported. I also tried a recent version, but that had a compile error.
It’s totally possible to compile your own! I haven’t done it in a while (since making that .jar and .zip) so I could be wrong about specifics, but all you need to do is pass versions for Spark, Breeze, and py4j: ./gradlew -Dspark.version=2.3.0 -Dbreeze.version=0.13.2 -Dpy4j.version=0.10.6 shadowJar archiveZip I just looked up the breeze / py4j versions for spark 2.3.0 so these should be correct.
could you try updating to the latest version, recompiling, and running again? I’m sorry! We have fixed a few segfaults in the last month so I want to be sure we’re not spending time double-debugging
I just noticed that a new hail folder was added to the repo, so I need to update my scripts and reflect that change. Also, I try to compile hail using Spark 2.3.0 but it’s not working anymore:
we’re moving toward a monorepo for our (currently separate) other projects too, so need to add a directory
I get a similar issue when using AWS instance store instances. I don’t get the issue with EBS instances. I haven’t put time to find out why (may be the file system). I hope this helps.
Any EBS should work fine. I use c4’s all the time (i.e. c4.4xlarge). They work well on demand and as spot.
The commit which should fix this just got merged this evening. The problem arises because g+±4.8.x doesn’t recognize “-march=sandybridge”, it wants “-march=corei7-avx” instead. In theory you should be able to work around it by setting “export CXXFLAGS=-march=native” before building

Our main interest in dance is to work with humans and their feelings, bodies, and to bring their energy, movements, endurance and emotions together. We have developed two paths, which often intersect each other. One is focused in contemporary technique with a special attention on floor work, spirals and strength. The second is transitions looking for our own personal ways of approaching movement, in connection with ourselves, others, and our apparatuses. In both cases the research is around the process rather than the product, going behind the aesthetics, and looking for humanity and authenticity through dance. We merge all this knowledge and bring it to the apparatus to work further on sequencing and routines.

As always, thanks to my co-host Rob Kelly, Sea King of THE AQUAMAN SHRINE, for doing all the post-production on these episodes! Intro theme, “That Time is Now,” by Michael Kohler. Special thanks to Daniel Adams and Ashton Burge with their band The Bad Mamma Jammas for our fantastic original closing theme! This episode brought to you in part by InStockTrades.com!
To answer some of your questions, Shag, NO, there definitely are not enough Batman books coming for Villains Month. DC choosing to spotlight only sixteen of his rogues is a clear indication that they’ve lost faith in his ability to attract readers now that Grant Morrison has moved on.
I’ve been reading GREEN ARROW since Jeff Lemire and Andrea Sorrentino took over. I thought their debut, issue #17, was one of the best single issues of Green Arrow I’ve ever read. I absolutely love Sorrentino’s art, as it looks like a mix of Jae Lee and David Aja. (If you’re reading Aja’s HAWKEYE, you might find the art in GREEN ARROW derivative.)
After issue #17, however, the first story arc moved a little too slowly. And by “a little”, I mean “way”. That introductory arc has wrapped up, though, and it looks like the pace will pick up as Ollie has a new mission and direction. Issue #22 should be a good one to pick up if you want to give the series a chance.
Also, yes, there is a BATMAN/SUPERMAN series starting in two weeks, written by PLANET HULK-writer, Greg Pak, and drawn by the aforementioned Jae Lee.
1) As a French Canadian, I don’t say the infamous “eh?” at the end of sentences. If I do, it’s only in writing, and only ironically.
2) Hergé is pronounced with a soft “G”, it’s Hair-Jay (but you have to remove the “d” component in the letter “j”. Like in Fabergé eggs.
Well, Aquaman and Justice League seems to be bringing Rob down. Like him, I have no interest in the Others. Ostrander’s name on the cover might have made me curious though. Marketing fail.
Brian Wood’s Conan the Barbarian is the first Conan book since Roy Thomas/John Buscema’s days I’ve been able to read for more than one issue. I love it.
C’mon Shag & Rob! Yes there’s a Batman/Superman title coming from Pak and Lee as mentioned by Mr. Drunkula. I heard that issue #1 has already been delayed and is late. So that’s off to a poor start. Artist’s fault? Or another case of multiple last minute editorial changes that we’ve been hearing so much about from DC?
While I’ll agree that Justice League #20 has some less than consistent art from Gene Ha, I don’t think that’s indicative of his talent or style to per say. I think Gene gets a raw deal, as Rob mentioned, he seems to be the go to guy in a pinch to fill in on Justice League, unfortunately for Gene, I think those are last minute jobs that are thrown his way on a very short deadline. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that after DC announced the week before JL #20 came out, that it’d have a fill-in team, that Gene Ha announced the next day that he’s taking a year off. I think he’s tired of not being used consistently by DC unless they have a last minute super tight deadline that they throw his way. I think under normal circumstances, his art is pretty top notch, just look at all of the great covers he did on Adventures of Superman back around 04 and 05. I would say his work has gotten even better since then. I agree that a lot of the New 52 has a very generic art feel to it, and I think that one way to solve that would be to give Gene Ha a regular book to star on and bring his great style to, unfortunately that won’t be the case anytime soon.
I share Rob’s sentiments, I too am finding myself not enjoying some of the comics I traditionally read, not so coincidentally I find that to be the case pretty much only on the DC books I’m reading. I continue to see my once giant DC pull list dwindle due to books I like being cancelled, and the other books being completely bland. I have been loving IDW, Dark Horse, and Valiant stuff I’m reading. Brian Wood’s Conan is awesome, it is my favorite series I’m reading, glad you’ve picked it up and have enjoyed it. I highly recommend looking into Brian Wood’s series The Massive as well from Dark Horse. It’s a great environmental book. I’d also check out Brian Wood’s Star Wars series as well. Pretty much Brian Wood is the man. And yes Kurt Busiek’s run on Conan was pretty awesome as well. I highly recommend picking up the “The Frost Giant’s Daughter” tpb, which is the first arc of Busiek’s run with absolutely gorgeous art by Cary Nord.
And now you have trashed Robotech on the show (Rob!!!!). You are slowly working your way through all things awesome and good. For shame. For shame.
After spending 6 hours in lock-up for attempted arson with a big greasy guy named George who kept trying to get me to hug him and squeeze him and call him by his name, combined with your continual hating of all my childhood favorites, I am starting to think this show is bad for me. But I’ll probably keep listening, because things that are bad for you are good, right?
Well, off to smoke a pack of cigarettes and drink some tequila while chomping on a few KFC Double Downs. If I don’t comment on the next episode it’s because I am dead.
Shagg and Robb, Let me chime in on the hottest Legionnaire debate with my thoughts… I’d say it would have to be… WILDFIRE! Quite laterally they don’t come any hotter!
I really love Gene Ha’s work so it is surprising to hear Rob’s thoughts. His work has a sort of raw feel so it needs the right story to complement. His stuff on the Project Superman Flashpoint mini worked perfect for that story. And I highly highly recommend Action Comics #9 by Morrison and Ha as a single story commenting on Superman, creator rights, and commercialism.
I also love Alan Brennert’s stuff. The Detective Comics #500 story is great. But, of course, ‘Should Auld Acquaintance Be Forgot’ is perfect and cherished by Supergirl fans. (If interested, my look at the story here: http://comicboxcommentary.blogspot.com/2010/12/back-issue-box-christmas-with-super.html) I have heard that Mark Waid got in trouble from DC by letting that story slip through in his role as editor.
I understand Rob’s feelings when talking to Brennert. One of my comic book heroes (and I wonder the response this will get) is Howard Chaykin. A couple of years ago at the Boston Comic-Con he was sitting alone at his table and I sat down and talked to him for about 20 minutes straight about comics and his stuff. It was spectacular.
Lastly, I will echo the love for Wood’s Conan. Crisp quick stories with an ongoing theme exploring the Conan/Belit doomed relationship. The first arc, with art by the Becky Cloonan, is near perfect comic story-telling.
I liked Aquaman #20, even if it was a “backdoor pilot” for The Others. This would have been a “Showcase” or “First Issue Special” issue back in the day. The team is still interesting to me and there is a lot of potential for a sort of super-secret, non-Justice League team in the current DCU. The new addition is interesting, although the team is still down a member since there has not been a replacement for Vostokk yet.
From a real world perspective, it was also nice to see John Ostrander getting work right now, to be honest.
Shag, you do realize that Rob Liefeld hadn’t worked on Hawkman in the better part of a year, right? Tom DeFalco wrote it as an 80s style superhero book and it was really pleasing to read, much like Jurgens stuff on Firestorm. At least I’m getting thrown a bone in the form of DeFalco writing the Shadow-Thief book in Villains Month, which is appropriate as he created her in the pages of Savage Hawkman. Jurgens is not writing the Killer Frost one, unfortunately, but Sterling Gates is a nice choice too.
And the Eclipso book by DiDio and Tan should be awesome… everything they have done together has been great.
Did you guys actually read Green Team #1? You should try it, because it is once again that elusive “something different” which everyone constantly clamors for but never buys. After all it’s not another freaking Batman comic.
I don’t think Luke is commenting on Green Team as an alternate super team to contrast the JL, I think he’s saying as a whole it is a refreshing new style book in a New 52 Universe that we’ve seen become very generic in feel, as well as look (as Rob touched on this episode). When New 52 launched it was very diverse, we’ve seen a lot of those great diverse books cut now and replaced with stuff that “sells well” which consequently means its got the same generic feel as the preexisting books that are okay sales wise. I’ve been sad to see books like Resurrection Man, Firestorm, Blackhawks, GI Combat, and now Dial H, Demon Knights, and Legion get the axe. They were all a different type of book that a lot of the others, and now they’ve all been cut.
I completely agree that the Green Team is a fun, offbeat book with lots of potential. Can’t be bothered with the Others though.
Ahh sorry I misunderstanding what team you were talking about in your post. I agree I’m a little sick of The Others at this point. It would be nice to have Aquaman back in his own book. I really wish DC would have an anthology style book in the vain of Action Comics Weekly (but not weekly, stick to monthly) that had multiple short stories in it. I think that’d be a great way to test the waters for new character ongoings as well as keep heroes whose books were cancelled still prominent in the DCU. This sort of book would be a good choice for a story on the Others as well as some solo tales for characters like Firestorm, Booster Gold, Deadman and/or Martian Manhunter who don’t have their own ongoings.They could call it Showcase and it’d be a very welcomed book I would think.
I’m all for a Showcase anthology book, but I don’t know if DC would see it as a good investment. After all, they tried it most recently with Our Greatest Adventure (and whatever the preceding mini was called) and nobody but me remembers the awesome New52 Robotman it spawned.
On a monthly basis, DC Universe Presents was a Showcase type book (just not an anthology) and that was recently cancelled.
I liked the My Greatest Adventure and Weird Worlds recent anthologies … but more because nobody but me remembers the awesome Tanga comic it spawned.
Part of the problem with those books (and the DCU Presents) is that they were built on the 6 issue story model. That’s not a showcase, it’s a commitment. They should make it in the model of 1st Issue Special, throwing new stuff and old characters in one-and-done stories. See if anything sticks.
I know DC Presents didn’t do well and I think a lot of that was format. You had 4 to 5 issue arcs in some case which are doomed to fail if its a character with limited following. You make it an anthology book that could appeal to say Martian Manhunter fans, Firestorm Fans, Adam Strange Fans, etc and you have multiple comic demographics buying one book. A lot of stuff has been a big miss in the last 3 waves, I’m not sure what they have to lose at this point trying something truly New compared to the other stuff their producing right now.
Maybe, but I’ve had qualms in the past about getting a book for 8 pages of something I like, when I dislike or don’t care about the remaining 16. These days, most people think with their wallets.
I remember both Weird Worlds AND My Greatest Adventure, and the awesome Tanga, Garbageman, and Robotman stories they spawned. Lobo wasn’t bad either. But the problem is that those two books existed primarily as a showcase for Tanga and Garbageman, both of which I doubt will ever be used except by their respective creators (Kevin Macguire and Aaron Lopresti), and were never “really” part of the New 52.
@Siskoid, Yeah, I guess Stormwatch fills that role, but I have never read an issue of it in any incarnation so I really couldn’t tell you much about it. Same goes for the Suicide Squad. So I guess I really don’t know what I am talking about on that front! I still liked Aquaman #20 anyway.
As far as offbeat DC books, I also recommend The Phantom Stranger. Rob will probably balk at it, but the book has been reading like a Vertigo title and is a compelling and full read month in and month out.
1) Being Polish myself, I’m pretty sure the surname you butche— er, I mean, tried to pronounce is “Za-VEE-sha.”
2) I’m so glad Rob got to meet Alan Brennert. Not wanting to steal Rob’s thunder, but I too had the pleasure of Mr. Brennert’s company for lunch back when I lived in California. I wrote to him and told him how the 1980s Twilight Zone episode “Her Pilgrim Soul” had inspired me to write my first musical for community theater, which in turn got me into music school as a music major. He was quite tickled by that, and since I already lived in southern California, it was easy for us to hook up. “Her Pilgrim Soul” in my opinion is the very best episode of any Twilight Zone series in all its incarnations, and that’s saying something. I also think it may very well be one of the finest pieces of fiction ever aired on commercial television. I also recommend his other Hawaiian-based novel (other than “Honolulu”) called “Moloka’i.” I thoroughly recommend it; I couldn’t put it down.
3) A few months ago, I pointed out an error that Shag had made in referring to Multiplex’s alter ego as “Dalton Black.” In the original series run, his name was “Danton Black,” not “Dalton Black.” Shag graciously acknowledged the correction on one of the podcasts. However, I should note that under the pen of Dan Jurgens, the alter ego of Multiplex is now officially “Dalton Black.” It suggests to me that Mr. Jurgens may very well haved relied on this site and/or the podcast for some amount of research!
4) Put me down as another supporter of the concept of reviewing the 80s run of Firestorm. As much as it’s been fun to review the new issues as they come out, it’s the 80s run that was such an integral part of my childhood. I look forward to hearing the Shag and Rob take on this classic run. I think going back to it, we’ll all be amazed at how much story was once packed into a comic book, back when comic books considered themselves to be an actual form of literature rather than research-and-development storyboarding for the television and film industry.
“Did you guys actually read Green Team #1? You should try it, because it is once again that elusive ‘something different’ which everyone constantly clamors for but never buys. After all it’s not another freaking Batman comic.”
I completely agree with the sentiment that comics need the “something different” and that “not another freaking Batman comic” would be welcome. But I think the concept behind the Green Team is appalling and I won’t be trying it out. I won’t say much more than that. Given some of the things I’ve said in the past, you can probably imagine why. I hope that’s vague enough to survive moderation and to not start a fight.
@Martin Stein Returns, “A song is a song, you either dig it, or you don’t.” If you don’t like the concept of The Green Team, go read Simone’s The Movement. Or don’t. All I say is try to look past what you might normally read and find that “something different,” whether it’s from DC, Marvel, Dark Horse, Image, IDW, Boom, Zenescope, Bongo, Moonstone, or any other publisher…

A high-speed path-following controller for long combination vehicles (LCVs) was designed and implemented on a test vehicle consisting of a rigid truck towing a dolly and a semitrailer. The vehicle was driven through a 3.5 m wide lane change maneuver at 80 km/h. The axles of the dolly and trailer were steered actively by electrically-controlled hydraulic actuators. Substantial performance benefits were recorded compared with the unsteered vehicle. For the best controller weightings, performance improvements relative to unsteered case were: lateral tracking error 75% reduction, rearward amplification (RA) of lateral acceleration 18% reduction, and RA of yaw rate 37% reduction. This represents a substantial improvement in stability margins. The system was found to work well in conjunction with the braking-based stability control system of the towing vehicle with no negative interaction effects being observed. In all cases, the stability control system and the steering system improved the yaw stability of the combination.

A model following adaptive sliding mode tracking control (MFASMTC) with the adjustable control gain based on a disturbance observer (DOB) for the mechanical system is proposed in this paper. The control gains of the proposed controller are automatically adjusted to compensate the unknown time-varying disturbances by the DOB. First, the unknown variables and uncertainties are lumped as the disturbance terms and the system dynamic model consist of the nominal matrix and disturbances vector. The desired model and sliding mode controller (SMC) are integrated by using the Lyapunov function candidate to obtain the general model following sliding mode tracking control (MFSMTC) with the fixed control gain. To stabilize and compensate the unknown time-varying disturbances for the control system, a DOB is combined with the MFSMTC to obtain the MFASMTC to automatically adjust the control gains. The mass-spring-damper system and two-link manipulator robot system are both used as examples system to demonstrate the proposed control scheme, respectively. The comparisons between MFSMTC with the fixed control gain and MFASMTC with the adjustable control gain based on a DOB are performed in this paper. From the simulation results, the proposed MFASMTC with the adjustable control gain based on a DOB demonstrates the stable and robust control performance for the unknown uncertainties and external disturbances. The proposed control method also can be applied to the other mechanical systems with the desired model to find the desired model following adaptive sliding mode tracking control.

She said the young patient was the least ill of all the other people who were there, and that he could get up.
He said her "demeanor was unprofessional and not the standard we require of all who provide care through El Camino Hospital", according to the network. Therefore, she had been removed from the working schedule, and the hospital officials are now performing more investigations on the matter.

The unique motor with Zehus technology is called “All-in-One” because the motor and battery are included in a single unit. It has a power output of 250 watts and it can be used to pedal up to a maximum of 25 km/h, the legal limit for vehicles in this category.
Thanks to its small size and reduced weight, the motor is hidden away in the hub in Moto Morini E-bikes, making them feel like traditional bicycles.
The frame, handlebars and wheels are made of aluminium, which combined with the 3-kg motor, allow for a total weight of only 13.5 kg, almost the same weight as that of a traditional bicycle.
Pedalling on the new models in the range is assisted by an “All-in-one” motor hidden in the hub using Zehus technology, which sees the incorporation of a Lithium-ion battery, a regenerative braking mechanism, and an electronic control unit. The battery is recharged via regenerative braking and you can check the charge level through an app, developed by Zehus, which also acts as a dashboard and can be downloaded free of charge for Android and iOS devices.
With a dedicated app, the system is controlled and managed in all its functions and mappings via Bluetooth from smartphones (Android or iOs), which also fulfil the function of a display/dashboard.
The revolutionary Frame Block is found in the rubber-coated steel cables that are an integral part of the aluminium frame. These act as an anti-theft chain and, being part of the vehicle itself, allow the bicycle to be insured in case of theft.
The anti-theft chain has a locking system with a personal six-digit code that also identifies the frame number and ensures that only the owner can unlock it.

Everybody and his girlfriend in the Sierra Club seem to climb only the three highest summits when in Mexico, so we decided during our recent vacation to climb the fourth and fifth highest ones. (Ed. note: 4th and 7th) Number four and the altitude scale is Nevada de Toluca, which is located inside a national park with the same name in Estado de Mexico. The mountain is a volcanic crater of roughly horseshoe shape and the crater contains two lakes, La Lune y El Sol.
The mountain is easily located because it dominates the surrounding landscape. Turn off Federal #15 before entering the city of Toluca from the north, a few hundred yards before a customs checking station. This turnoff is marked with a small sign. From here all future turnoffs on this now wide highway are marked with large national parks signs, and park headquarters are easily located. Past the headquarters one turns left into a narrower but still very good road which ascends to a ranger station about 13,500 feet altitude. It is compulsory to register here for the climb.
One can take the car here and take the trail or drive to the crater lakes and start the climb from there. After a short but steep ascent of about 1500 feet the peak is reached. The route is class 2 plus. We climbed the peak in April and a few snow patches were still evident. During the winter months this mountain will offer a beautiful snow climb, more so if the full length of the crater is traversed.
The park is well organized with the high altitude ranger station manned all year. Here also is located a substantial lighthouse built for climbers and skiers guide them in case of storm and nightfall. Do not forget to pick up a beautiful diploma signing out. A fee of 5 pesos is charged for it; the money is used for conservation purposes.
A visit to this beautiful park should be on everyone's list who visits Mexico City. We shall never forget the beauty of the raging tropical thunderstorm deep down in the valley as seen from the high altitude ranger station the night before our climb.

The first Despicable Me was a bright, fun film that managed to balance the goofiness of the premise (a supervillian adopting three girls) with a strong enough story to carry the amazing number of jokes. That is mostly the same for this sequel, although the story is nowhere near as strong.
Despicable Me 2 brings back our (anti)hero Gru (Steve Carell), as well as his three charges, Margot (Miranda Cosgrove), Edith (Dana Gaier), and Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and scientist Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) as they attempt to adjust to post-villian life. Gru is kidnapped by Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) of the Anti-Villian League in a Hannibal-esque plot to find out who stole a mysterious chemical compound. This brings Gru to posing at a mall, where shop owners Eduardo (Benjamin Bratt) and Floyd Eagle-sn (Ken Jeong) are the prime suspects. Of course the minions are back, with their gibberish and nonsense, providing plenty of antics throughout.
This film doesn’t benefit from the originality of the first film’s premise, and there is a lot here that will feel familiar to adult viewers. However, the pace of this film is relentless, and makes up for the sparse plotting with a joke approximately every 3.5 seconds. So if one moment doesn’t quite land, there are at least two more right behind it. More hyperactive than most kids’ fare in recent memory, Despicable Me 2 leans heavily on the Minions, those little yellow dudes with the goggles, to carry an entire subplot. I get tired of them fairly quickly, so if you are a fan of these guys, your take is likely to be much more positive.
Despicable Me 2 is slighter than some other animated films so far this year (see Epic), and in an ironic way this installment feels like an extended commercial for the Minion merchandise kids will be begging for on the way home. As far as suitable summer fare goes, you could do a lot worse. Gru and friends provide a worthy distraction that will fly by.

Climate change is no longer a theory, it is a reality. It is no longer about "future generations" but it affects our current environment. Cruel paradox: the effects of global warming are threatening in priority the least polluting countries. Dramatic droughts and catastrophic floods follow one after the other, along with annual climate conferences. Greenhouse gas emissions have increased by two thirds since the Rio Conference in 1992.
Transition to a green economy represents the third industrial revolution, allowing the creation of millions of jobs in Europe and worldwide. Europe must therefore lead the way in imposing concrete measures.
A return to fossil fuels is unthinkable, we must therefore focus our research and development policies on effective renewable energy production, while continuing research to properly exploit existing or future deposits.
We propose a European energy community based on the following points: diversification of a common European energy mix and of supply sources, a mutual assistance mechanism in case of energy shortage.
Companies should be encouraged to turn to other sources of energy but they can do so without having the certainty that all stakeholders share the effort. Putting a greenhouse gas emission is the strongest signal that companies expect in order to change to renewable energy sources.
An innovative, sustainable and non-discriminating source of financing, it can enable the creation of a global investment fund for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Your ppp0 interface does not have an IP address and with only having a loopback lo0 interface with 127.0.0.1 there is no way you can connect to any network.
So you would have to review your PPP settings. I am afraid I cannot offer much assistance. Since more then 6 years I have ADSL and haven't touched a real modem since that time.
A way out of your trouble could be to make a backup of your data and configuration files, reinstall and secure your system so you don't get cracked again
Your advice became a great clue, and finally I established a working connection by making a Network(PAP) connection in Sysinstal Utility. it's work fine.

Refrigerator biscuits are made from a stiff dough that is refrigerated to become stiffer. The dough is typically shaped into logs which are sliced into rounds before baking.
This treat is easy to make and can be prepared the night before. Bake fresh when needed and can be easily doubled without re-adjusting ingredients.
Pull out a sheet of wax paper about the length of your ranges width. Lay down the dough onto the paper, stretching it out then roll it into a log.
Salmon pie is variant of tourtière filled with salmon. In this Québec version, the pie is a preparation of cooked salmon and mashed potatoes. The mixture is then placed between pie crusts, and is otherwise prepared in the same manner as most other sweet and savoury pies.
Peel and dice potatoes then boil until they break apart by pressing against the side. Drain when ready.
Place potatoes, onions, garlic and salmon in a bowl. Mash contents and add butter, milk, salt and pepper until mash is creamy and smooth.
Place into pie crust then cover with crust. Make sure you cut a small hole near the centre of the pie.
Pour in milk slowly while stirring. Continue stirring for about 5 to 7 minutes or until sauce thickens.
Pâté chinois is a French Canadian dish similar to Shepherd’s Pie. It is made from layered ground beef, canned cream corn, and mashed potatoes on top. This recipe is a variation that infuses the dish with garlic, you can vary the amount of garlic in the dish if you prefer a more subtle effect.
Pâté chinois is not Chinese cuisine. One theory is that dish was introduced to railway workers by Chinese cooks while building the railroad.
Melt butter in a pan then place ground beef, onion, garlic, Italian seasoning, salt and pepper. Cook on medium-high until the meat is golden brown. Drain meat then layer on the bottom of a baking dish, pack it down lightly until layer is uniform.
Pour cream corn into baking dish, cover ground beef layer uniformly. Be sure to leave a few tablespoons of cream corn for later.
Drain water then add garlic butter and milk. Mash until you have a smooth mixture. Spoon mashed potatoes into the baking dish, adding the third and final layer to the dish.
Use remaining cream corn to cover the mashed potatoes. This will prevent the potatoes from drying up in the oven.
Pouding Chômeur is said to be a French Canadian dessert introduced during the Great Depression. This dish is easy to make, requires few ingredients, and suits those with a sweet tooth and is excellent when served with a portion of vanilla ice cream.
In a pot mix water, brown sugar, and butter then set heat to medium-high. Stir on occasion until syrup comes to a boil.
Concurrently, mix in a bowl the ingredients for the pudding until you have a smooth consistency. If the pudding mix does not pour, add in a bit of milk.
Once syrup boils, pour contents of the bowl in slowly. Pudding should float over the syrup base, so spread out to even out the pudding.
Heat for 15 to 20 minutes in oven until the pudding is well cooked. Poke the pudding with a toothpick to check if ready; when toothpick comes out out clean, pudding is cooked.
A jam made of sweet onions, wine and blackcurrant liqueur. This dish makes an excellent hors d’oeuvre when served with strong cheese and something crunchy, or served up on a toasted bagel.
I usually serve this up as a snack, mixing an aged cheddar, feta, or blue cheese and serving it atop a Grissol roasted baguettes (pictured).
Reduce heat to low. Place onions in pan, mix and then allow the onions to sweat. Heat should just be below the point where the onions bubble over.
Reduce near low heat and reduce the mixture until you have the desired consistency. This step will take several hours, so remember to mix occasionally.

This week had been monumental in the number of things that are being completed. However, the item of the most significance was this. I finally completed the Pics to Picks piece and I can say that it has been completed in the year that it was started!
I am not great at keeping records and as I was trying to use yarns and warps that were on hand, I could not remember how much black warp was on the loom. I knew that I had about 2m of the coloured warp and that I wanted the horizontal plane change over at about the halfway mark. As I kept weaving, I noticed that there was not that much black warp left on the back beam. This is a bit of designing on the run, so I made the horizontal layer change and hoped for the best.
There was enough coloured warp left to give a decent length scarf so I decided to keep weaving. As the warps were on 2 different back beams, I could cut the black warp off and continued weaving until I ran out of the coloured warp as well.
﻿I washed the piece in hot water by hand, and then rinsed and spun dry in the washing machine, hoping that the silk stainless yarn will do its thing and crinkle up. I can not describe my exictement when I got it out of the machine and it worked to my expectations!
Thanks, Meg for organising this, Esmae for sending me the picture and Kaz for leaving behind the demo warp from the ikat workshop!
Congratulations, well done. It seems we both took a detour in dyes this year, but ended up ending the year weaving. :-)
Yes, Meg, I am really glad that I stuck it out. Once the warp was on the loom, I knew that I would have to finish it. It was only a matter of time.
I am game for another P2P type project but was thinking of doing the weave juice cards that Kaz has sent to me. Do you want to do that?

Here’s a great perspective on the latest news from the Loews Jersey City thanks to Stephen Whitty: “Well, it looks like we’re going to have movies at the Loew’s Jersey City a little while longer. The city, which has been trying to evict the non-profit group that has been restoring, programming and managing the theater, lost that lawsuit today. The judge, it seemed — imagine this — ruled that a contract was a contract and the Friends of the Loew’s could stay…
The Friends had saved the city-owned theater from destruction and have been painstakingly restoring it — mostly through volunteer labor, donated materials and small grants. The city wanted to bring in a major promoter instead and, after some lavish renovations, basically reopen the space as a concert hall.
As you can tell, I am not impartial in this. Actually, I think that this small band of movie lovers would go up against Jersey City and win is like something out of a Frank Capra movie. And, not surprisingly, the city’s response to the decision could have been snarled by a Lionel Barrymore villain.
The judge’s ruling, said a city spokesperson, “guarantees the theater will sit as is with only sporadic silent movies, even less frequent concerts, no air conditioning and no ability of the group to complete the restoration. It is upsetting because the most important thing to the FOL was protecting their own personal salaries and fiefdom, despite the fact they can’t complete the repairs after 25 years.”
The fact is that the theater has never shown “only sporadic silent movies” but a full menu of films — along with hosting concerts, drama festivals, and community and private events, all at affordable prices. (Were you there for last year’s “The Shining” Halloween costume party? You should have been.)
It’s true that there is no air-conditioning and that the restoration isn’t complete — plenty of promised funding never arrived, and the FOL has had to rely largely on donations and volunteer labor. It’s not true, as is implied, that anyone is getting rich off this — I’ve read the Friends' tax returns, and according to the last one I saw they had exactly two full-time, not very well-paid, staffers.
The theater does need help and — as the Friends themselves agree, more concert acts can be part of that programming. Anything that brings more life and energy to Journal Square, and more money into the Loew’s box office, is welcome.
But we don’t need to see the Loew’s turned into just one more overpriced, local concert hall booking nothing but the same second-rate acts. We do need one — at least, please, one — picture palace where movie lovers can see films the way they were meant to be shown and local residents and arts groups can have a say in the programming.
This isn’t necessarily a happy ending, because it’s not an ending — even after today’s decision, the Friends' current contract runs only another five years. But for the Friends — and their friends, of which I am obviously and unabashedly one — it is a very welcome intermission."
It would be a shame to see this grand-looking theatre either go the way of movie theatre heaven or to be restored as an over-priced concert hall.
BTW, anyone who hasn’t yet visited the Loews and walked through its magnificent spaces is really missing something.
I would like to know the name of the spokesperson who questions the motives of the paid staff of the Loew’s while earning their salary off the taxpayers as a government flunkey who is so ill informed that at best they are repeating the party line and at worst questioning the ethics of individuals who with great dedication have fought for many years to save this jewel in the New Jersey crown.
This is a person who knows nothing of their struggles and achievements yet with the typical hot air of one who claims authority while knowing little of their subject speaks only for those who wish to exploit the efforts of so many years of the Friends of the Loew’s for personal financial gain. This same individual 25 years ago would have happily witnessed the destruction of this great building crowing eagerly about what a great boon to the economy a large, ugly, soulless office building would be.
City spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill offered a statement later calling the judge’s decision “a loss for residents.”
“Instead of the possibility of daily events with global talent coming to Jersey City, this instead guarantees the theater will sit as is with only sporadic silent movies, even less frequent concerts, no air conditioning and no ability of the group to complete the restoration,” Morrill said. “It is upsetting because the most important thing to the FOL was protecting their own personal salaries and fiefdom, despite the fact they can’t complete the repairs after 25 years.”
Her lack of knowledge(to put it very very kindly indeed) about what the Friends of the Loew’s has meant to Jersey City and her ugly swipe concerning those running it is appalling.
This woman owes a big apology to those who have a commitment to this city and this theater which is beyond her comprehension. The fact that she would accuse anyone else of protecting their own salary is beyond rich.
I really don’t understand why the two can’t coexist. Both bring something to the table. And anyway, it seems like these places are never booked as much as officials promised after the restoration is complete. So it is likely there would be plenty of time for silent movies and community events.
One would like this to be the case but after the government swoops in to take advantage of literally decades of the Friends of the Loew’s struggles and work(I’ve been going there since they could only show movies in the lobby) as soon as we see them in league with the big music promoters I think we can say goodbye to reasonably priced classic films. It would simply cost too much money to open the theater after such an expensive renovation for such little revenue. Those who have dedicated so much time to the theater will be left out in the cold(I hope I have to eat those words.)
Look at Radio City, Loew’s Paradise and the Kings. Do any of these show films at what once was called popular prices? Do they show silents with an organ? I’m not aware of it if they do. Maybe someone has more knowledge of this than I do.
I just find it so ironic that people like Ms Morrill who view the world through green colored glasses talk about being concerned with benefiting the people of Jersey when all she sees is a cash cow. As other cities renovate theaters for over priced concerts that locals can’t even afford Jersey City politicos are chomping at the bit. They can’t even wait 5 lousy years! That says it all.
As I said before if she and people of her kind had the say so years ago the Loew’s would have become nothing but rubble.
My question is: how many venues can you have? They just finished renovating the Kings, now they are talking about renovating the Brooklyn Paramount, and they did a great job on the Paradise only to decide after a few years that it was more lucrative leasing it to Creflo Dollar.
If they do spend top dollar on a renovation I just hope the Jersey doesn’t end up being a millstone.
Imho, the more movie venues that’s available, the more choices in movies that people have to choose from. The fact that so many movie venues have gone the way of movie theatre heaven is unfortunate, because it severely restricts the kind(s) of movies that’re available for people to choose to go and see.

The University of California’s governing board appointed two UCLA students to serve as representatives on the board.
A Board of Regents special committee nominated Devon Graves, an graduate student, as the student regent-designate and Rafi Sands, an undergraduate student, as the first-ever student adviser.
The student adviser is a nonvoting position the Regents created last year to provide an additional voice for students. The student adviser will serve for one year and have access to open-session regents meetings and be able to make recommendations on issues that concern students.
Graves will serve as the student regent-designate for one year, and will have voting powers when he succeeds Paul Monge, the current student regent, in July 2018.
Graves, a doctoral student in education at the UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, serves on the California Student Aid Commission, which manages the state’s financial aid programs. He previously served as chair of the California State Student Association’s board of directors.
Sands is a fourth-year business economics and political science student who was the undergraduate student government’s external vice president last year.
Graves said he plans to build relationships with state legislators and other university stakeholders and bring attention to college affordability issues many students face.
“I want to get students out there in Sacramento and help them highlight their stories,” he said. “We need to make sure the decisions we make as a university are informed by what students are facing.”
As a graduate student in education, Graves said he thinks his academic background allows him to provide an expert view on the board.
“I’m a plan to use my background in academia and as a (California State University) undergraduate to better inform the board,” he said.
Sands, who advocated for the student adviser position when he was the director of policy for former student regent Avi Oved, said he thinks the position will allow more student perspectives to be represented on the board.
“This position is by no means the end-all be-all, but I think it’s a step in the right direction for student representation,” he said.
Sands added that because student regents tend to be graduate students, the student adviser can ensure that undergraduates’ concerns are being heard. He added that graduate and undergraduate students do not always agree on issues, such as allowing undergraduate students to work as teaching assistants.
