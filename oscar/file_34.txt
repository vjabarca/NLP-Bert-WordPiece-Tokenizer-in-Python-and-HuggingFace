“He was told ‘no,’ and that basically because he’s married to a U.S. citizen — he would never be granted a visitor’s visa, even though we made it clear he only wanted to come for the birth of his child,” said Morris, explaining that they were told by government employees that spouses granted a visitor’s visa often remain in the country illegally.
Morris’ parents were with her at her son’s birth in June 2015. The Kentucky mom says while their support helped her greatly, it wasn’t the same as having her husband by her side.
“It was scary for both of us,” Morris told TODAY through tears. “I wanted him there to hold my hand.”
“To be married, and have your husband that is so excited to become a father, and to know that a piece of paper is why he can’t be there to experience the birth of his child — that’s really hard,” Morris continued.
Morris and Sloum are among many families impacted by the halt in immigration. One pregnant Missouri woman is facing being without her Iraqi husband who was set to travel to the U.S. for their baby's birth. Iraq is one of the countries from which the president’s order suspends arrivals. In another case, an Iranian green card holder who married an American and has lived in Chicago for 10 years is currently in Iran with the couple's young daughter, an American citizen. They had been there visiting family and are now unable to return due to the ban.
Kim Anderson is president of American Families United (AFU,) an organization that helps U.S. citizens who marry immigrants navigate immigration law.
“U.S. citizens who marry immigrants often find themselves caught by the confusions and contradictions of immigration law,” said Anderson, who calls U.S. citizen spouses “the forgotten constituency” in the immigration debate.
Paul Donnelly is a consultant for AFU and says the U.S. census counts 4.1 million Americans who are married to immigrants.
“Nobody counts how many have had problems with immigration law, but our best count is at least 300,000 citizens are married to people who have some problem with immigration law that causes them to face the choice of being exiled, or outlawed — not unlike Tori Morris,” said Donnelly.
Donnelly explains that spouses, kids and parents of U.S. citizens are what's known as "immediate relatives" and they are the highest priority for legal immigration to the U.S.
“People think (immigrants) aren’t vetted — they are,” said Morris. “Your entire life is just opened up on the table for strangers to see. We’ve had to give details of our marriage and tell about when we got pregnant — it’s these intimate details of your life and your marriage that you just have to tell people. You have to prove that this person you chose as your husband is good enough.”
Still, with an uncertain future and invasive measures, Morris says she and Sloum, who Aiden calls "Baba," will not give up hope, because of their son.
“It’s hard. From the time Aiden was little, he’s always known his Baba’s voice because we Skype daily,” said Morris. “Sometimes we’ll be Skyping and he’ll reach his arms out and want Baba to hold him. He doesn’t understand why he can see his face, but can’t touch him.”
“I hope he knows I am far from him because I love him so much,” said Sloum. “I want him to know I do this so he has an easier life than mine… we are just people trying to make a good life for our family.”
“We just want our son to live a happy, safe life,” Morris agreed. “What I hope everyone would remember about my family — especially if they’re a parent — is that every decision you make as a parent is for your children… to give your child safety and full health care and an education. That’s all that we’re trying to do.”
“AFU is ready to go with Tori Morris to speak with her Senators — Rand Paul and especially Majority Leader Mitch McConnell — to fix this god-awful, un-American mess,” Anderson told TODAY.
Morris says she dreams of the day when she and her son meet Sloum at the airport to welcome him home, and imagines what life will be like when they sit down to dinner together every night as a family.
“I’ll finally have my life back. I feel like when I left him in Ghana, someone just hit pause,” Morris explained. “Since that day, we’re still living — and we have this beautiful little boy and we’re so thankful — but so much of our life has just stopped because how do you move on? How do you create a life without your spouse? It’s like we’re all just holding on until we can hit play again.”
And now, with an immigration ban leaving the future uncertain, Morris wonders when she will be able to carry on with her life.
“I hope that seeing our family’s story makes this entire situation more relatable to people — that’s my goal,” said Morris. “As much as we miss each other, as much as our hearts are broken — if I took my son to Ghana to live and anything happened to him, I could never forgive myself because I had another option — as a U.S. citizen I had that privilege.”
Thank you to Susan Ferriss for covering American Families United in a recent article on immigration. You can read the article in its entirety at the link below:
"For years, these citizens have tried to persuade Congress unsuccessfully to reform these penalties— arguing that the bars have done nothing to deter illegal immigration and instead are a disproportionate punishment falling on Americans. Multiple bills with some bipartisan support have so far stalled in Congress. "
In this very challenging time for everyone, I wanted to be sure to take a moment to express heartfelt gratitude for the AFU family. It is the strength, the friendship, and the love that has shown through the past several weeks as members have held each other up, dried each other’s tears, and encouraged each other to stand firm. And for the chance to experience that, I am grateful.
It is not the circumstances we would have wished for, nor do most of us feel like we need any more fortitude tests to show we are strong!.... and yet we are. And we will continue to be, perhaps even more so. And for the chance to be a part of that, I am also grateful.
There is simply no way to sugar coat it, next year will be a tough year. But, AFU will not just sit back idle. Regardless of the winner of the presidential election, we knew there would be a lot of work to do to fight for our families. And so, while it may be strategically different than we had hoped, we will keep on fighting for our rights as US citizens to be with our families here in the US. We will keep being a fierce voice to bring our exiled US citizen families home. It will take all of us, as shattered and tired as we are. I know we can do it.
In the next few months, you will see a lot more updates in regards to our plans. I know you will want to stay abreast of this news and our calls to action...so, please take the time to make sure that these emails are not going to spam and that the information in your AFU profile is up to date. We are hoping to employ a lot more strategic opportunities via email, phone, Facebook, and Twitter that will require everyone's attention.
I would also like to take this time to ask seriously that you consider including AFU in your year-end donations, to help with the intense lobbying we will be needing. As a reminder, no one at AFU gets a salary, everyone is a volunteer. All our funds go directly to support AFU’s lobbying and communication needs. Our needs are greater than ever right now, as you can imagine. Please go to our AFU website to donate, and could you ask other family and friends to do so as well? Even the smallest amount can help.
In December, please note we will also be sending out communications regarding membership dues. Unfortunately, the system has not been actively asking our members to pay their yearly dues for quite some time now and so perhaps when updating your profile, you might consider renewing if you have not already done so.
As families, all over America travel to be together tomorrow, we are reminded that many of our AFU families cannot do so. May we enjoy the incredible blessing of being with our family if we are able. And may we hold all our AFU family members who cannot in our hearts, as we fight on to the day that all our families will be together.
Washington, April 29th: “As US citizens whose families have been damaged by immigration laws that contradict American values, we are encouraged and grateful that the bipartisan American Families United Act (H.R. 2095) has been re-introduced in this Congress,” said Kim Anderson, AFU President, Americanfamiliesunited.org.
“It is often said that there is so much partisan gridlock in Congress that it cannot get anything done to fix our broken immigration system,” Anderson said, “and that this is a reason why the Congress is so unpopular. But the hard work and courage that Beto O’Rourke (D-TX) and Steve Pearce (R-NM) continue to put into finding a solution to this critical issue shows that’s not the whole story.”
American Families United is an organization of US citizens whose families face sometimes unsolvable problems with US immigration law from violations that can be technical or trivial in nature. “It’s death penalty consequences with traffic court rules of evidence”, Anderson explained.
“We are the neglected constituency in the immigration debate,” Anderson said. “The Census counts 4.1 million Americans who are married to immigrants, of which perhaps as many as half a million have faced problems like those of AFU members. But every American who has run the gauntlet of our broken immigration system looks at cases like ours and thinks: there but for the Grace of God and a glitch in the paperwork, goes my family.”
AFU will organize around the introduction of H.R. 2095 to build legislative progress by recruiting cosponsors in the Congress, as well as constantly adding AFU members to our national organization.
American Families United, on the eve following the announcement by President Obama applauds the White House for the courage to take an important first step in righting the wrongs of an immigration system that separates, exiles, and destroys US Citizen families and punishes US Citizen spouses for loving aspiring Americans.
With full hearts, the membership of our organization, comprised primarily of US Citizen spouses who are married to undocumented immigrants celebrate today for our AFU citizen families that will be made whole again under the President's action. Yet we simultaneously languish in the continued suffering of AFU's US Citizen spouse members who have been forgotten: Childless US citizen spouses and those trapped in exile abroad under the burden of a magnanimous decision to keep their families united simply do not deserve further exclusion and punishment from their own country. It is untenable that as US citizens they would not be treated at least as favorably as others in the President's brave effort to relieve the suffering of families torn apart. American Families United will not allow the cries of these families to be lost in today's noise, either in affirmation of the Executive Action's particulars or in criticism of its audacity.
Our government can and must go further and must not leave US Citizens behind, period. We are certain both the Administration and our legislative processes can work to eliminate this needless destruction of lives. We have seen the best of effort to relieve this suffering in the bi-partisan efforts of Republican Congressman Steve Pearce and Democratic Congressman Beto O'Rourke as they brought forth HR3431, The American Families United Act, which corrects legislatively the fact that US Citizens who chose to marry foreigners should not be forced to choose between their country and their life. We have been empowered by the expressions that US Citizen families being kept together is an American value, as exemplified by myriad other bi-partisan co-sponsors who listened to AFU members and then ACTED to right this wrong.
While extremely grateful, AFU asks for immediate and continued examination by the Administration of AFU's proposed reliefs within both the framework and intent of present EA announcements. Finally, we call upon our legislators to work together immediately, as we have seen happen in bi-partisan efforts of HR3431 so that US Citizens will be treated with the respect and dignity that their birth right, our American values, and humane laws should afford them.
As the majority of the country agree's, America's Immigration system is broken and outdated. On August 25th, American Families United joined a coalition of groups asking the current administration to focus on a single goal: addressing the egregious backlogs for legal immigration by adopting better rules for counting principals only to deal with set limits. We believe such a simple change as this would help significantly accelerate family unification, eliminate backlogs for employment based opportunities, and reduce unauthorized immigration without an increase to legal immigration. You can read the full letter or fact sheet at the included links.
Congressman Keith Ellison (MN-5) today cosponsored H.R. 3431, The American Families United Act. H.R. 3431, introduced by Congressman's Beto O'Rourke and Steve Pearce, simply provides an opportunity for the US citizen spouse of a person who has an obstacle created by what are often trivial or merely technical violations of US immigration law, to go before an immigration judge or officer and make their case that the penalty for the US citizen and their family is too harsh.

Generally, biomedical engineers design instruments and devices to cope up with the needs of healthcare field and research and obtain knowledge to develop advanced procedures. The recent advents in medical technology like artificial joints’ development, MRI, bioengineered skin, and the heart pacemaker and other cardiac diagnostic instruments are some important reasons for prospective career growth in biomedical engineering.
There is a wide scope for new employment opportunities in biomedical engineering. Biomedical engineers can be employed in institutes or laboratories or firms that deal with bioinstrumentation, biomechanics, biomaterials, systems physiology, bioinformatics, and clinical engineering.
Bioinstrumentation is the application of electronics principles to design and develop devices used in diagnosis and treatment of disease.
Biomechanics is the application of mechanics and its principles to design and develop artificial devices or organs that replace missed parts of the body. Development of artificial heart and heart valves has opened a new era in biomechanics field.
Systems physiology deals with engineering techniques and tools that are used in bioengineering procedures.

The 2007 Vuelta a Espa�a will start without not only last year's winner, but without the entire 2006 podium. Despite this, the racing will be as close and exciting as ever. Cyclingnews' Gregor Brown picks out the favourites.
The riders of the 62nd Vuelta a Espa�a will start their 3291-kilometre journey this Saturday, September 1, from Vigo, heading out onto a parcours that, along with the composition of the peloton, should make for a gripping 2007 edition of the race. Organiser Unipublic has continued to do what it does best by offering an exciting three-week journey, this year delivered in the form of a one-two punch.
The fight for the Maillot Oro will take place as the roads guide the riders from north-western Spain in a clockwise direction. It takes in Galicia and Asturia on its way east before skirting down the coast for the southern stages. It is the northern stages of the first week and the southern stages in the third week that will pack the biggest punch. After the sprinters have had a chance in the first three days, the GC contenders will come out to play, and we should have an early glimpse of the final winner as early as Tuesday - just four days into the race - when the riders meet their first big obstacle: the 12.6-kilometre ascent of Lagos de Covadonga.
After stage four, the second big appointment will be the 52-kilometre time trial in Cari�ena to Zaragoza. The slightly downhill parcours will be shaped by the wind, which is always a factor in the Spanish Tour.
There will be no respite for the overall contenders, and they will head immediately into the mountain-top finishes on stage nine (167.6 kilometres to Cerler) and stage 10 (a massive 214 kilometres to Andorra), both of which will blast out weaker riders and lock down the GC-battle to a select set of champions.
As the Vuelta travels to the south for its final punch after the second rest day, the sprinters and strong winds will have their day in the sun as the race hurtles toward a thrilling final week conclusion. Before the riders have their parade lap into Madrid, they'll have to deal with Stage 19, the third-to-last stage of the Vuelta, which will put the final icing on the cake. The 'short' 133-kilometre stage to Alto de Abantos is where Valverde lost the race in 2006, and is packed with five classified climbs before the final mountain top arrival.
Unlike the Tour de France with its brutally long and decisive time trials, the Vuelta's second time trial is just 20 kilometres in length, and will not likely make much of a difference in the pecking order of the final GC. However, if the overall classification is separated by mere seconds like this year's Tour, the flat dash around Villalba could make for an exciting stage before the sprinters have their romp into Madrid.
The last editions of the Grand Tour have been marred with difficulties. Roberto Heras' title was stripped in 2005 after he tested positive for EPO, and the podium of 2006, now, seems more like a display of painful memories. Astana's Alexander Vinokourov (2006 winner) and Andrey Kashechkin (third) have both tested positive for blood doping in the last months, while Spain's favourite, Alejandro Valverde has been forced to face the courts in Operaci�n Puerto-related matters.
Pereiro and S�nchez have been targeting the Vuelta all year. Sammy S�nchez is one of the most dynamic riders in Spain. Seeing him round out his palmar�s, which includes the GP Z�rich, with a Grand Tour would be spectacular. Gomez Marchante's fifth place overall in 2006 proved the man can ride a good three week race, and his Spain-based team will back him completely as he goes for the top of the GC.
Sastre, mister consistency, will for sure be in the top five by Madrid. He finished fourth in 2006 after riding the Giro d'Italia and Tour de France. For 2007 he will be 'fresher' after only tackling the French tour. The shorter lengths of the time trials should favour the CSC rider, who excels on the climbs but suffers devastating time losses in the test against the clock.
It will be interesting to see what Australian Evans can do on this course after spending so much energy in the Tour de France, where he finished a close second behind Alberto Contador. His strong team could help him ride to the race's top spot.
American Tom Danielson is back on form after battling an intestinal illness that, among other things, caused him to miss the Tour. He picked up a stage win on his way to sixth overall last year. With the help of pure climber Brajkovic, he could make the top of the podium.
'Ale-Jet' Petacchi is the biggest winner of the group with 17 wins. The Italian will point to come back kicking after a dark period following the Giro. Double Tour stage winner 'Benna' and Freire will be the ones to threaten Petacchi the most. Expect to seek World Champion Bettini, 'Tin-Tin' Rebellin and Schumacher take the cake on the rolling stages.

With no medications approved for treatment of anorexia nervosa, a potentially fatal eating disorder, the finding that the antipsychotic olanzapine improved survival in a mouse model of anorexia offers some encouraging news in the search for treatments for the disorder. Researchers at the University of Chicago reported in Neuropsychopharmacology that mice treated with small doses of olanzapine were more likely to maintain their weight when given an exercise wheel and restricted food access, conditions that produce activity-based anorexia (ABA) in animals. Stephanie Klenotich, a graduate student in neurobiology and the paper's first author, said, "We found over and over again that olanzpine was effective in harsher conditions, less-harsh conditions, adolescents, adults—it consistently worked."
Daniel Le Grange, Ph.D.,a coauthor of the paper and director of the University of Chicago's Eating Disorders Clinic, pointed out that one challenge in this area is finding a medication that anorexia patients will agree to take regularly, since they often reject drugs that cause weight gain or have strong sedative effects.

The next big superhero movie of the fall is set to be released to the general public on November 17. Some lucky people were able to see the movie early we’ve got the insight you need before you make the decision to hit the movie theater.
“Justice League” follows six of the most popular DC characters as they do what heroes do — save the world. The movie that took a rumored $300 million to make stars Ben Affleck (Batman), Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), Henry Cavill (Super Man), Jason Mamoa (Aquaman), Ezra Miller (The Flash), and Ray Fisher (Cyborg).
With the exception of the blockbuster hit “Wonder Woman,” modern-day DC movies don’t have a history of doing well in theaters. Add that to the fact that we weren’t given origin movies for three of the protaganists, it’s safe to say that it most likely won’t be as popular as “Avengers.”
Brandon Davis loved it! Stating: “Justice League is not a perfect movie. It has story “flaws” and a simple, CGI villain. BUT, more importantly, it gets the heroes right. Every member of the League is fantastic and it’s tough to choose a favorite. It’s a ton a fun, start to finish.”
Paul Shirey agrees that the film was fantastic. He wrote: “Justice League feels kind of like a re-launch of the DC world in live-action. You walk away wanting more of every hero, including Justice League 2 and standalone films.”
Josh L. Dickey, on the other hand, was not a fan. He claims: “Nothing could save JUSTICE LEAGUE from its loud, ugly, tacky self. Not Wonder Woman, not wide-eyed Ezra Miller, not Joss Whedon’s quippy teardown & rebuild. And Henry Cavill’s mustache is an actual issue; they gave him Uncanny Valley Face. Oof, guys. It’s a rough ride”
Germain Lussier seems to be right in the middle. He said: “JUSTICE LEAGUE! It’s okay. Narratively it’s a mess, the stakes don’t work & the villain isn’t great. HOWEVER, the heroes ARE great, it’s funny, & there’s some surprisingly effective character work. I didn’t love it, but there are enough good pieces to excite me for the future.”

Have you ever been in those situations where you need to get ready in 5-7 minutes, think to yourself, "hey, I could squeeze in some eyeliner," and end up doing eyeshadow and the whole she-bang? And then you arrive at your appointment 15 minutes late. I have experienced this one too many times, so I've learnt (the hard way) what to LEAVE IN THE DRAWER when doing makeup in a jiff, and also a few tips to speed up the process!
Primers help your makeup go on smoother (and therefore less blending) so it is one of the most important steps! Most of you already know this and I'm sure you have seen different coloured primers in the store. But which one is for you?
I know it's hard, but try your best to get a foundation in a shade that blends in well with your neck! If your foundation is too light, you'd have to spend time on bronzer to darken it up, and if it's too dark, you have to faff with highlighters and lighter-coloured powders. Lancôme, MUFE, MAC and Nars are a few high-end options that have foundations that come in a bajillion shades, and L'Oreal is a great drugstore alternative! Use a sponge/dense brush to quickly dab/buff everything in!
Wait, don't panic. It doesn't mean you shouldn't fill in your eyebrows! When in a hurry, I go for tinted eyebrow gels. These colour and set your eyebrows in 5 seconds with just a couple of strokes, while with pencils, you have to do precise outlining and brushing through to make sure everything is blended. Save the pencils, powders and pomades for days when you have the luxury of time!
If you used a peach/yellow primer, it would already cancel out some darkness under the eyes. Dab foundation for slightly more coverage. Or if you have REALLY TERRIBLE eye bags/circles, don't put the concealer on your cheek bones, nose bridge or forehead. This will save you about half a minute of blending!
If you're a fan of a matte base finish but don't fancy the cakey and dry look, use a powder with a SLIGHT shimmer (a.k.a. NOT like the Mary Lou-manizer!) to give a glow-y effect! If you like the dewy-but-not-greasy look, set your foundation with a translucent powder!
I am quite prone to mistakes when I use powder blushes, especially pigmented ones like those by theBalm. The chance of applying too much product at one go (especially if you're panicking) is high. I personally find cream and tints easier to control! They're great for people with dry skin and for those with oily skin, set it with powder and it lasts all day! Also, the stress of having to blend tints before they set in awkward spots/streaks on your cheeks is a great incentive to blend faster! ;D
Blush already gives your face the lift, glow and dimension it NEEDS, so you won't look pasty or ghostly. Contouring (IMO) is just to further sculpt the face. Time is of the essence, so pass the contouring and bronzing! If need be, just a few swipes at the beginning of the hollows (at the hairline) will do.
If you feel like you can't leave the house without at least a bit of colour on your lids, use one or two swipes of cream eyeshadow! I am a MAC Paint Pot and Colour Tattoo fan! Don't be tempted to try and blend it out! You don't have to (unless you screwed it up and it got on your brow bone or something). Another option is to just define the crease with a bit of brown/taupe eyeshadow. Apply lightly so you won't have to spend too much time trying to blend it out! Of course, you could also go bare altogether!
Unless you're a pro or going for a smoked-out effect (which you probably won't be considering that you're VERY late), eyeliner takes time and precision. Just tight-line with a creamy, waterproof pencil to give that definition your eyes NEED and the appearance of thicker lashes instead!
Try to find a mascara that volumizes and lengthens! This way, you won't have to layer mascaras to get enough definition. If you are going to be out for a long time, try to find one that is waterproof! You may not be able to get a mascara that does all three things, but there are many who do at least TWO! If you can spare a few more seconds, coat your bottom lashes with mascara too! That really opens up your eyes.
Use a tinted lip balm or lip stain, even a hybrid (think Revlon Just Bitten Kissables!) You don't even have to apply it right then, you can bring it along for on-the-go application, since you don't need a mirror! The most tinted lip balm I've ever tried is the Palmer's Dark Chocolate and Cherry Lip Balm! The oval shape of it also makes slathering it on a breeze! Sheer/glossy lipsticks are also another option. Pigmented lipsticks have to be applied carefully or you could mess up (cleaning up and reapplying is NOT something you'd want to do when you have to be out the door in 1 minute!), and ain't nobody got time for that!
So these are my 10 tips/things I can leave out in my makeup routine when trying to complete it in less than 10 minutes! These might not work for you if your makeup routine HAS to include some of the things I'd skip, but that's alright! I hope you enjoyed reading this post anyway and I hope it helps some of you!

Its a big day. Today is the start of Alabama's youth hunting weekend... and my oldest son's first deer hunt. We've got a fantastic spot. Big food plot with so much deer sign it makes you wonder if we aren't feeding the deer population of half the county. On wednesday we came to scout and when we drove up in the afternoon there were 7 deer and 14 turkeys in the plot.
I know there is debate over the viability of the .223 as a deer round... but I find those that disapprove have generally never used one for such... and the only stories they've heard came from their grand-dad in the 70s.
Bullets technology has changed. Winchester Ballistic silvertips for example... 55 grains... 3200 fps. An inch after impact they've expanded to half and inch in diameter. So basicly you're blowing a .50 caliber hole through the heart and lungs. The fact is... inside 150 yards.. a well placed .223 will drop a deer just fine. And that's what Jeb will be shooting today. Now... odds are we're gonna be on the does today... and the deer down here in lower Alabama aren't like the deer up in TN or KY... they are little like West Virginia deer. I mean the biggest deer down here that the old timers even know about being shot was 290 pounds. Contrast this with Michigan deer that are known to be upwards of 400. Plus we'll be shooting around 70 to 100 yards.
If Jeb gets one there are all kinds of rituals out there. Prayer obviously... and in the old days ya tasted the animal's blood. Down here its tradition to use the blood like war paint on the shooter's face.
rained out. It poured on us all day long... and of course... 20 minutes after we head back to camp it stops raining... and the deer all come out. I hate deer. Man do I hate deer. The wasn't totally lost... Jeb did kill the hell out of an armadillo just for spite. Good shot. Blew it to hell and gone.
I never went hunting, but I did cap a tied-up goat in the back of the head with my 9. Does that count?
Are you going to go for one of those turkeys for the holiday dinner this month? To be fair, I have heard opinions on both sides of the argument: store/farm bought vs hunting/wild. Which do you favor domestic or wild?
My first deer was a button buck at about 65 yards, give or take. I shot it on my grandparents farm. I used my 30-06 150 grain Winchester bullets, probably bought at K-Mart. It was cold as heck, well below zero and I had it dressed out and hung up in the garage in less than an hour.
I have no idea how many critters I've killed since that first one. Mostly I've used the 06. I've done a few in with handguns and other rifles over the years. Most though I still take out the rifle my dad gave me when I was 15.
Shooting a .223 on large game is illegal in many states. Most places at least a 243 is required. I have no doubt that I could kill anything up to a griz with a 223. If I was I'd at least used a 72 to 77 grain bullet not a varmint load. That said its not my first choice. I like a bigger bullet at least 105 grains because sometimes you are shooting through a shoulder at a quartering angle, and a light bullet can be deflected into a non lethal spot.
Never hunted deer. Growing up on our farm we did a ton of dove and quail hunting. Sept 1st was like a holiday to me. Start of dove season. My fav memories are waiting under some oak trees around dusk and shooting doves as they flew from neighbors massive corn fields to roost w my single shot 20 gauge. That and chewing gold rush or red man tobacco as we waited. I was around 13. I preferred the gold rush.
My first bow deer. I was 13 or 14. I went hunting most of the time with my friend, but for some reason he wasn't going. We had been using a couple tree stands about a hundred yards apart. He had gotten a shot or two at deer but i hadn't.
I was hunting in a big crick bottom that was a couple hundred yards wide, but where my stand was it choked down to maybe 75 yards with steep sides.
I blew on my grunt call. I heard something, but I thought it was probably a squirrel. A minute later, I saw him sneaking in behind some trees. He came walking right down the trail towards me. I pulled the bow when he was behind a bush. He walked up and stopped about 5 yards away. I was already concentrating on his shoulder so when he stopped I released. He took off with my arrow sticking out. I watched him hit a tree with the arrow as he passed it.
I got down and started tracking. Pretty easy. When I got around the hill, I couldn't see him. He should have been there. He had fallen into an old dugout foundation a few feet deep that was ringed with rocks. A couple years later I shot another deer that ended up about five feet away on the edge of the same hole.
It was a small buck, three points on each side. Somehow I lost the horns. Would be nice to have them now.
I just gave up deer hunting here close to DeeCee, too many dang people out in the woods with their brand new Walmart 300 WinMag that they've never shot before. But now that I have a place out in the sticks... I shot a deer last week, in my front yard, with a .22 long rifle. Head shot from about 30 yards. I'm thinking that's the way to do it. I put out a bait pile of corn, sprinkled with a little deer cocaine, and I just sit on my porch and drink beer until one that I like shows up (or more properly, don't like), pop it in the head with the .22, and that's it. The only problem with that approach is that all those deer hanging around kinda scared my daughter when she took the trash out at night.
Following his titanic struggle against General Zod, Metropolis has been razed to the ground and Superman is the most controversial figure in the world. While for many he is still an emblem of hope, a growing number of people consider him a threat to humanity, seeking justice for the chaos he has brought to Earth. As far as Bruce Wayne is concerned, Superman is clearly a danger to society. He fears for the future of the world with such a reckless power left ungoverned, and so he dons his mask and cape to right Superman's wrongs. The rivalry between them is furious, fueled by bitterness and vengeance, and nothing can dissuade them from waging this war. However, a dark new threat arises in the form of a third man: one who has a power greater than either of them to endanger the world and cause total destruction!

The first day back to school is always weird. I mean, really weird. Particularly the first day of the new school year, after nine weeks off. Nine weeks of laughter, tears, squabbling, singing. Nine weeks of elephant feet up and down the stairs, ‘I’m bored’ multiple times a day, squealing, shouting, chatting. Then a sudden silence descends on the house, and it’s louder than all of that put together.
The silence doesn’t sound right, not now at least. I miss my children. I miss them giggling as the play together upstairs. I miss the cuddles when someone has taken a bump. I almost miss the squabbling. For now, anyway. It just feels so foreign, to hear nothing in their place.
The silence represents so much. The end of the summer, no more long periods of family time until Christmas. It signifies the return of the dreaded early mornings (which I absolutely suck at, by the way). It signifies that yesterday it was summer, and today it isn’t. It’s just a weird feeling. My kids are a pain in the bum sometimes, but I like having them at home.
Of course, I know in a few days I will relish the quiet. Finally I’ll be able to get some work done in peace. Finally I’ll be able to drink a cup of coffee without it getting cold. I’m also very much looking forward to autumn, which is absolutely my favourite season. So in some ways, the silence does represent some good. It doesn’t stop it feeling weird today though.
How do you feel about your children going back to school? Do you feel a bit odd on the first day back, or do you relish the first bit of peace in weeks? Please tell me I’m not the only weirdo who misses their children as soon as they’re gone!

I don’t work from home so i’m out the house when my kids are at school. We all go back next week which i am really sad about because i don’t want to go back to work or my kids to go back to school yet. I feel we’ve not had enough time together (even though we’ve had 6 weeks), it’s just gone too fast!
My daughter has really struggled with not being at school. She loves the routine and seeing her friends. We have all enjoyed the adventures though and a part of me will be sad
I am tired of all the bickering but it will be too quiet without them. September looks to be super busy so I’m looking forward to being able to crack on
I’m going to miss the summer holidays so much. The house will be very quiet without my girls at home. Thanks for linking up to #ThatFridayLinky
I’m right there with you. The first few hours are nice, I get a lot done that I would struggle to complete with her around, and then by the afternoon I’m looking at the clock #thatfridaylinky

Count Richardson is the brother of Emily Richardson, and the uncle of David Richardson and Mark Madreio. He is the Legends equivalent of Jonandorf. It could be argued that he is in fact the main antagonist, as it is due to him that Mark's crusade begins.
Jon was born in London. When he was young, he became interested in chemistry, however, the slightly unconventional chemistry as alchemy. There was one major problem: this was 40s. No-one believed in that kind of stuff anymore. So he took a bunch of money from his rather wealthy parents and ran away to Germany at the age of 22, after graduating from Warwick University. There, he joined the courts, and gradually moved up through the ranks until becoming a count in the north of the country. A few years later, his sister, along with his brother in law, Richard Madreio, were visiting Germany, unaware they were on Jon's land, when an earthquake hit. They were forced to evacuate, without their son, Mark, who was found by Jon. Jon, at this point, was a tad mad, and was livid at his family to disassociating him for his dabbling in alchemy. As such, he takes Mark, and manipulates him, convincing him that his parents actively abandoned him, for 18 years, until Mark snapped. Mark goes to find his parents, and murders them, unaware that there was another child in the room, some 10 years his junior. He then goes on to found M-Corp, and basically leaves Jon forever.
However, cut to about 13ish years later, and Jon actually succeeds in his alchemy! Slight issue, this is impossible in this universe. Using his techniques, you should not have been able to change the molecular structure of elements to change them in their entirety. This creates large rifts in the Alteria, giving alternate versions of himself the ability to break the fourth wall, and see where their own reality is fiction. However, this gains the attention of 2 individuals: Desdemona, and Malinta. Desdemona goes to this reality's Dave Richards, and asks for help. Malinta disagrees, but Desdemona aint havin' non of it, and so sends Dave off to deal with Jon while she deals with Malinta. Dave visits, and finds out about his uncle, but refuses to kill him. Jon acts suspicious, prompting Dave and the others to investigate, eventually finding out about his involvement with Mark. Unfortunately, Mark finds out at the same time. So when Dave goes to confront Jon, he finds him dead by Mark's hand.

Francis is at it again, making another video for his Protestant 'brothers in blood'. This one was for the Celebration of Christian Unity event held by the John 17 Movement in Phoenix, Arizona. Francis' usual Protestant friends were all there. Here's the flyer for the event:
Apparently Francis has been so poorly catechized he doesn't recognize that his words which follow this statement,
"It is he who is persecuting Christians today, he who is anointing us with (the blood of) martyrdom. He knows that Christians are disciples of Christ: that they are one, that they are brothers! He doesn’t care if they are Evangelicals, or Orthodox, Lutherans, Catholics or Apostolic…he doesn’t care! They are Christians. And that blood (of martyrdom) unites. Today, dear brothers and sisters, we are living an “ecumenism of blood”"

“Gleason’s utterly confident novel is the first in a projected series about the 8th century Carolingian dynasty. Gleason’s grasp of (his) characters is nothing short of marvelous; dialogue is sharp throughout, and the book’s obviously vast research is smoothly worked into the narrative.”
Winter term of my freshman year, the drinking age was eighteen and several of the guys in my dorm and I decided to hit fraternity row. It’s a bucolic little street with maybe a half-dozen fraternities lined up on each side. It’s anchored on one end by Baker Library and on the other by the President’s home (neither of which did much to dispel the revelry one enjoyed there).
Late that night, Chuck, Lefty, Hilliard and I found ourselves in the basement of Beta. There was a crowd but nothing specific going on – no band or cocktail party – just beers on a Friday night. We were standing near the back of the basement where four guys were playing a game of “Zoom, Schwartz.”
Zoom, Schwartz is a drinking game. While the rules are simple, the game itself is difficult to play – especially if you’ve been drinking. It’s a verbal game of tag where players stand in a circle and bark out one of four commands to tag another player – who then has to use one of the four commands to tag someone else. If you speak out of turn or fail to respond quickly enough when you are tagged, the game stops and you are required to drink. You are only allowed four drinks to a cup of beer and if you get tagged three times in a row, you chug.
The four commands are, “Zoom” – which designates the player at whom you are looking. “Schwartz” – which designates the last person who spoke. “Budeman” – which designates the person to your left. “Perfigliano” signifies the person to your right. On this last, the shortened “Figliano” is considered an acceptable contraction due to the speed of the game.
It took us a nanosecond to say yes. Freshmen aren’t always welcomed into upper class sanctuaries, let alone invited to join in their fun. I had an older brother who belonged to Bones Gate (another fraternity) where they played a similar game called Wales Tails (‘nounce pronounce the prince and four, regular Wales Tales, the prince calls on…) So, I thought we could hang.
We couldn’t follow them. It was like watching a professional team play against a high school. They owned us. And we were too embarrassed to quit. Once they realized that we couldn’t keep up, they started to single each one of us out, ganging up to force three mistakes in a row. We were chugging left and right. It was a nightmare. The drunker we became the worse we played. Finally, one of us booted and they kicked us out. We returned to our dorm in shame.
We chipped up a keg, I called Mo’s and within an hour we were set to go in the common area of our dorm. We circled around a trashcan and made a vow that none of us could leave the game until we booted. We nicknamed the game “Boot, Shwartz.”
We played all day. We stumbled through the first hours, but as time moved on, we began to feel the rhythm of the game.
“Zoom, Shwartz, Figliano, Budeman, Budeman, Schwartz, Zoom.” We became supercritical of each other. “That was a roving Zoom. Drink!” “Too slow. Drink!”
Sunday morning the keg was still there. So was the boot bucket. Each of us took our places and again we began. One beer in and we were back up to speed. We started using headfakes, double Zooms. We got so good, if felt like we could read each other minds.
“Zoom-Zoom, Budeman, Figliano, Figliano, Shwartz, Shwartz, Zoom, Schartz…the sequences got longer and longer…it took a minor miracle for someone to make a mistake. No one booted on Sunday.
Same basement. Same guys. They seemed surprised that we had returned. We got a beer and talked amongst ourselves, waiting…hoping to get the invite. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the Beta boys discussing it amongst themselves. They were laughing, remembering how poorly we had played last week. Finally, one of them shrugged and they all nodded.
Lefty started. We double-zoomed them and although they were surprised, they were quick enough to return fire. We began to use head fakes. We anticipated each other’s moves. The Beta boys started to falter. After ten minutes, they were drinking as much as we were. We adopted their tactics, imitated their moves. They started to get angry.
Now the alcohol was working against them. Their faces grew serious. Ours, on the other hand, were exuberant. We knew we were winning. They tried to gang up on one of us, but we diverted the attack. After a really good head fake, one of them spoke out of turn. He drank. When he started the game again and we pegged him with another head fake. Same result.
“Fuck.” He knew we were coming for him. His buddies tried to deflect our assault, but we were faster. We were pounding him with commands, but despite all our pressure, he remained resilient. We had all of his attention now and could see the determination on his face. He wasn’t backing down and we couldn’t seem to catch him. He was playing at a higher level – until the triple-zoom.
You have to be really good to pull off a triple zoom. We had practiced it enough, but too often, the second or third player would speak too quickly, disrupting the order of commands. Speaking out of turn was a drinking offense, so the ploy backfired as much as it worked.
Hilliard set it up. He was grinning an evil grin and looking at my ear on each command, so I knew he wanted to try it. I looked at Lefty and he had seen it too. With a smirk, he nodded. We played along, waiting for Hilliard to get called. At long last he caught a Budeman. He took a deep breath. I looked at Lefty’s ear. Lefty looked at the Beta boy.
“Zoom-Zoom-Zoom.” We spoke almost in unison. The call bounced from Hilliard to me, from me to Lefty, and from Lefty to the Beta boy in under a second. By the time he realized it was aimed at him, it was too late. He had taken to long to respond.
“Get the fuck out of here!” The room had quieted. We suddenly were in unfriendly waters. Guys were lining up behind Beta boy.
I never got invited to join Beta. Neither did Lefty, or Hilliard, or Chuck. But, I’ll never forget the look on that guy’s face after the triple zoom. It was worth it.

I just love the yarn made by #uppspuni , our first ever minimill in Iceland 💛 and I’m so happy to finally have back in stock Birkilauf kits. The yellow is dyed especially for me with birki (arctic birch) leaves. There are now 2 more contrasting colors: a beautiful very dark grey and a grey, all natural colors of the Icelandic sheep🧡 There is only a limited number of those special kits and I won’t get more this year. 💛If you want one don’t wait too long: last time they all sold out in just a few days! 😱💛 Http://icelandicknitter.com/birkilauf-kit
My studio may look peaceful but it’s a very busy place! Head over to @laine_magazine Journal to find out more about how busy it can get and get a sneakpeak at the photoshooting of the Laine Issue 06, coming out September 28th! http://lainemagazine.com/journal . . And today it was very busy too as I’m prepping year 2019 😱
Week-end with the family 💛 Thank you so much for the response to my testknit call the other day! It was a “bit” overwhelming! I have all the testers needed and I spent most of the day answering each one of you who so kindly offered their services. Sorry if I couldn’t answer positively and sorry too if I forgot someone! Much loves! #letrucjaune #theyellowthing #familyweekend #fishingknittingbathingdogs #helenemagnussondesigns #helenemagnusson
TESTING CALL for Frjókorn, my new sweater/cardigan design. Read through for details! 🌸🌸 Edit 3 sept 2018: call is closed, thank you so much!! 💕 . Frjókorn is my first top down yoke, sweater/steeked cardigan, SUPERQUICK on big needles 7 mm/US 10.75, but still SUPERLIGHT, less than 300g and SUPERSOFT because of the lambswool it contains. What makes it truly special is the yarn: only 1 strand of white unspun plötulopi knitted together with 1 thread of my dark grey Love Story lace (that’s the soft lambswool) to give it strength. It’s the quality of the Icelandic wool that make it possible to knit a sweater at such a loose gauge on so bif needles, because the mix of plötulopi and Love Story blooms like a cloud and occupies the space. . Testknit hosted on Instagram. Opened to testknit in English, French and Icelandic, 10 sizes from XS to 3X. Testknit will have to be finished by September 30th, no picture to be posted before pattern release, October 3rd. . Before you ask, I don’t know what other sport weight yarn could be knitted at such a loose gauge on so big needles. Testknitters willing to give the wool (plötulopi + love story) a trial, in the colors of their choice, will get 20% off the price of the kit. Full price is from 42 € -58€ depending on sizes. Average price 45€. . If you are interested, pm me before Monday! The quickness of the sweater compensates for the possible shipping delay 🌸🌸
I WAS going to show you more of Frjókorn, my newest lopi sweater design (pattern will be published by the end of September!) but then I WAS distracted by @katedaviesdesigns new book, so I’m just gonna take the afternoon off, my knitting and a cuppa and immerse myself in it!
The number of people becoming more conscious about the health has increased, as more and more people adopt a healthier lifestyle. The demand for healthier alternatives has continued to increase, but there are some things people are forgetting, one of them being optical health. Many people take their eyesight for granted and don’t even visit an eye specialist unless they have a problem with their eyes. The good thing is that many young people don’t experience many of these complications when compared to the old, but it is still important to see an eye specialist. There are some people who have ended up losing their sight or spending a lot of money on treatment for something that would have been easily treated if they went for checkups or the moment they realised they had a problem with their eyes.
It is a good idea to have regular checkups and visit an eye specialist Auckland any time you start noticing any problem with your eyes. There are times when problems with eyesight is a sign of a more serious condition, and failing to see a specialist increases your risks, People with diabetes tend to develop a blurry vision, and this is why you need to see an eye specialist. There are different types of eye specialists, with some of them specialising in given discipline. If you have a more serious condition, you might have to choose a specialist who has specialised in that type of condition. They will be able to bring more experience because they have been able to deal with the condition more.
Seeing an eye specialist regularly will help with your optical health because you are able to keep track of the condition of your eyes and also get to learn how you can take good care of them. The eye specialist can recommend exercises for the eyes so they can be in the best possible condition. These exercises are a good idea because they help in reducing eye strain on your eyes.
Diet is also important when it comes to improving your optical health. Eating green and leafy vegetables will go a long way in helping your optical health because they contain nutrients that help the eyes. You can also take supplements, but the eye specialist needs to recommend the right ones, especially if you are not able to reach the daily intake requirement. Choosing the right eye specialist is important because he/she will be able to help you out.
If you have a specific condition, consider looking for an eye specialist who has specialised in that. Knowing who can help you with a given condition is important because you don’t have to waste your time going to eye specialists who aren’t able to help you out. If you have a problem choosing the right one, ask your doctor to help you out.
The right eye specialist Auckland will help you improve your optical health and treat any condition you might e having.

Below is the video, a link to the Vatican's transcript of Francis' remarks in Spanish, and another website's English translation (which is poor in areas).
Pope Francis has sent a videomessage on the occasion of the Day for Christian Unity which took place in Phoenix, Arizona in the United States on May 23rd.
Brothers and sisters, may the peace of Christ be with you. Forgive me if I speak in Spanish, but my English isn’t good enough for me to express myself properly. I speak in Spanish but, above all, I speak in the language ofthe heart.
I have the invitation you sent me for this celebration of Christian Unity, this day of reconciliation. And I wish to join you from here. “Father, may we be one so that the world may believe you sent me”. This is the slogan, the theme of the meeting: Christ’s prayer to the Father for the grace of unity.
Today, Saturday May 23rd, from 9 in the morning until 5 in the afternoon, I will be with you spiritually and with all my heart. We will search together, we will pray together, for the grace of unity. The unity that is budding among us is that unity which begins under the seal of the one Baptism we have all received. It is the unity we are seeking along a common path. It is the spiritual unity of prayer for one another. It is the unity of our common labour on behalf of our brothers and sisters, and all those who believe in the sovereignty of Christ.
Dear brothers and sisters, division is a wound in the body of the Church of Christ. And we do not want this wound to remain open. Division is the work of the Father of Lies, the Father of Discord, who does everything possible to keep us divided.
Together today, I here in Rome and you over there, we will ask our Father to send the Spirit of Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and to give us the grace to be one, “so that the world may believe.” I feel like saying something that may sound controversial, or even heretical, perhaps. But there is someone who“knows” that, despite our differences, we are one. It is he who is persecuting us. It is he who is persecuting Christians today, he who is anointing us with (the blood of) martyrdom. He knows that Christians are disciples of Christ: that they are one, that they are brothers! He doesn’t care if they are Evangelicals, or Orthodox, Lutherans, Catholics or Apostolic…he doesn’t care! They are Christians. And that blood (of martyrdom) unites. Today, dear brothers and sisters, we are living an “ecumenism of blood”. This must encourage us to do what we are doing today: to pray, to dialogue together, to shorten the distance between us, to strengthen our bonds of brotherhood.
I am convinced it won’t be theologians who bring about unity among us. Theologians help us, the science of the theologians will assist us, but if we hope that theologians will agree with one another, we will reach unity the day after Judgement Day. The Holy Spirit brings about unity. Theologians are helpful, but most helpful is the goodwill of us all who are on this journey with our hearts open to the Holy Spirit!
In all humility, I join you as just another participant on this day of prayer, friendship, closeness and reflection. In the certainty that we have one Lord: Jesus is the Lord. In the certainty that this Lord is alive: Jesus is alive, the Lord lives in each one of us. In the certainty that He has sent the Spirit He promised us so that this “harmony” among all His disciples might be realised.
Dear brothers and sisters, I greet you warmly, with an embrace. I pray for you. I pray with You. And I ask you, please, to pray for me. Because I need your prayers in order to be faithful to what the Lord wants from my Ministry.
What does orthodox Catholicism say about non-Catholics who are killed because they are identified as Christians? Or do we say anything?
What exactly DO we say about non-Catholics who are killed because of being identified as christians? I don't know.
Many papal documents and councils have decreed that non-Catholics, even if they shed blood for proclaiming Christ, are lost, not saved, unless they were infants (prior to the age of reason) who are baptized and have not committed any sin since baptism when they are martyred. I would give you a website to view that has a lot of documentation, but I'm not sure this blog owner will permit that. Seek and ye shall find.

I cut you alot of slack, Johnny Mo because you play for Canada but if you SCREW THIS UP and lose us the Gold I will be most annoyed. You owe us and especially you owe ME this for having to put up with all your shenanigans over the years. Plus if you lose it will make Kaitlyn sad and that is something that I just cannot abide.
I would consider bunking down in the actual Cave of Cool. Down with your goods. Hate getting woken up before 6 or 7. Even for curling. Televised Corporal punishment upon certain individuals, you know who I mean.....I'd get up for that.
Well, they got GOLD so I'm sure you and your Mom are happy! Along with the rest of Canada, of course.
Yeh,we are happy here. Kaitlyn is beloved around our house and the idiot Morris for ONCE didn't screw the pooch for us.
I forever stand vigilant to protect this planet from the myriad of forces that are always against us. Be it the octopus, zombies, aliens or the robots my team of human agents, and our feline allies, circle the globe in a never ending struggle for human freedom.
I learn all I can on every subject that interests me. I especially enjoy ancient history because in the past there are valuable lessons to be found. Also, if I ever get my time machine to work properly, it would be good to know a bit about possible destinations and what to expect when I get there.
I greatly appreciate beautiful design. Be it manufactured or found naturally I am fascinated by the process of invention. I am attracted to the unique, the strange, the haunted. I like to share what I find on this blog.
And not let us forget the 'Cephalopod Menace' who, if allowed to, would wrap their tentacles around all that is good and pure in this life and crush it until it remained no more. They are creatures of pure spite. Hate is all they know. Death is all they do. They are our most ruthless and determined enemy.
So we fight. Selena has the celebrity contacts, the cat is ruthless and without pity, Roosevelt's ghost has the experience and I do the wetwork.
Fighting for the future of the planet doesn't have to be a chore, however. We can take the time to appreciate all that is cool in this world even as we cut the octopus into bite sized chunks.
This is the reason there has always been and must forever be, a Cave of Cool. Be sure to wipe your feet before you enter.

Bruce Edwards and Grum Willcock ended up victors in the GMSC Crail Summer Stages in their Darrian T9, winning by a 40 second margin from Gary and Gordon Adam in their Escort. Both John Rintoul and Tom Morris suffered mechanical woes while in strong positions, and there was a tie for third between the Subarus of Colin Gemmell and Ross Fernie, settling in favour of Colin due to his time on SS1.
Ross Carbry didn't even know he had an entry until Friday lunchtime, so for a last minute rush he did really well. Graeme Rintoul and his father Jim were the first GMSC crew home in their Fiesta.
72 of the 91 Seniors entered completed the rally, an exceptionally high proportion, but unfortunately Jock McFarlane, George Fell and Roy Millar all rolled, caught out by tight sections at the airfield.
Not long to go now, and the forecast is for sunshine! First car on Saturday at Crail starts at 8am, and we can expect a full-on day of motorsport with cars able to fully enjoy the grippy Crail surface. Seeded entry list is here. The final instructions can be found here.
Marshals: We looking forward to welcoming marshals, signing on from 06:45 with a briefing at 07:15 at the stage start. We offer £5 fuel money, a hot breakfast, a packed lunch and entry into our marshals draw. There are plenty of prizes, including tickets for the Touring Cars at Knockhill (proper ones, not sitting at a marshal point!!). Bill is the Chief Marshal bill.creevy@btinternet.com 07740 374458 and we look forward to welcoming you on the day.

Thank you for your entry to the Summer Stages, we look forward to welcoming you all on the day. Once again the response has been brilliant, so the stage is set for another big day out at Crail. A few things to tell you, including a few changes from recent events, so sit up and pay attention…..
We have effectively completed the entry process for both the Summer Stages and the Summer Junior Stages, thank you for the tremendous response. Any entry now received will be added to the reserves; we have limited the Junior field to 10 competitors, allowing us 90 entries to the Summer Stages. We have already moved 10 competitors from the reserves to the main entry.
If you need to withdraw for any reason, please contact us immediately – you will receive a full refund and make one of our reserves very happy! If you are still on the reserve list, we will keep updating the unseeded list, so you can see where you are in the queue.
PLEASE NOTE; to maximise the chances of getting everyone through all the stages, the start of SS1 is changed to 08:00. You may wish to review your travel/scrutineering plans as a result. We are scrutineering in Leven on Friday night.
We have moved the closing date for the Junior Rally to Sunday 17th May. This will allow us to recycle any spare places not used by the Juniors. Please get your entry in as soon as possible. If there are any issues contact treasurer@glenrothes-msc.com .
We have had a fantastic response for this event and we are now fully subscribed and have a substantial reserve list. Thank you for your entries and well done to those who navigated their way through the entry system. We will be able to "promote" a chunk of the reserves once we have the Junior rally finalised, and to that end we have moved its closing date to the 17th May. We will then provide an updated position to the reserves.
Glenrothes MSC are delighted to return to Crail for another year to stage the Summer Stages and Summer Junior Stages, on 13th June. We offer 55 miles for the grown ups and 28 miles for the Juniors. We’ve been busy with the concrete again so you can expect an improved surface as we continue to invest in the venue. If the November event (and Ingliston this year) are an indicator, we expect a bumper entry, so early applications are encouraged. However, please note that an entry is not complete unless payment is made and the seeding information is completed.

Maggiano's Little Italy opened the doors of its first location on the corners of Clark Street and Grand Avenue in Chicago, Illinois November 11, 1991. What happened next, as they say, is history.
The restaurant was successful from the very beginning, with eager diners sometimes waiting hours for an opportunity to dine family-style. The portions of Italian-American cuisine were large, reminiscent of a Sunday night visit to their grandmother's house, or as they say in Italy, nonna's casa! The recipes were simple, authentic classics, many of them coaxed out of Italian grandmothers, mothers, and aunts whose ideas of a recipe were a pinch of this and a sprinkle of that. With some trial and error, the chefs celebrated the birth of many of Maggiano's signature dishes.

Dubai: The sukuk, or Islamic bond market, has been severely tested over the past 18 months. After five years of growth in issuance, size and investor appetite, last year saw a contraction of 50 per cent in the value of sukuk issued. The second half of 2008 and the first quarter of this year saw the market effectively closed.
While governments and investment-grade corporates in North America, Europe and Asia were issuing record amounts of bonds in the first and second quarters of this year, their Middle Eastern counterparts were also issuing - but in the conventional markets, not the sukuk market.
A well-publicised criticism of the mudaraba sukuk structure made by Shaikh Taqi Usmani, a prominent Sharia scholar, in February 2008, is often blamed for the drying up of the market. Of more impact, though, was the global credit crunch that struck shortly afterwards.
But recent months have seen developments that indicate a significant shift in the market, and which have profound implications. New buyers and sellers have emerged, at the same time as traditional participants have rediscovered their appetite for Islamic debt.
Indonesia's $650 million (Dh2 billion) sukuk issued in April effectively re-opened the market. Since then, Bahrain has raised $750 million, and last week Saudi Electricity Company tapped its home market for $1.9 billion, issued in Saudi riyals.
But study the detail of these issues, and new trends appear. Perhaps the most important is the emergence of the US as a source of sukuk investors.
Historically, the US has not featured on issuers' wish-lists of investors. The education needed to convince US investors to buy this asset class was too time-consuming, too costly and had little guarantee of success. And in the good times there was plenty of demand from the Middle East and Asia, so who needed the US investor? So went the perceived wisdom.
And yet, when HSBC was marketing the Indonesian sovereign sukuk this year, it received strong demand from US institutions, without any prior sukuk education.
Perhaps this demand should not have been surprising after all, the sukuk was issued to comply with the US 144A rule that allows marketing to onshore clients in the US. This was only the third sukuk offered in 144A format, and indicates a growing willingness by issuers to be offered in the US.
By complying with 144A, the sukuk becomes on a par with conventional bonds in terms of the documentation, legal framework and disclosure levels. We are now seeing sukuk issuers lean towards 144A offerings as a matter of course, which bodes well for the market.
The US is not the only new investor sector to have emerged: Islamic private bank investors have also become significant, with 10 per cent of the Bahrain issue being subscribed by this segment. Perhaps it is not surprising that such investors see the attractions of sukuk, given the volatility of other asset classes, but like the US investor base, demand has suddenly appeared.
The most visible result of these new investors entering the market has been the level of subscriptions. Bahrain's $750 millions offer was five times subscribed; Indonesia's was seven times subscribed, receiving commitments of $4.6 billion.
In both cases, this strong interest allowed the borrower to issue at pricing tighter than guidance, and, in the case of Bahrain, to increase the issue from $500 million to $750 million. The SEC issue was even more popular, receiving commitments of more than $5.3 billion.
So what can we conclude from these developments, and how do we see the market developing? First, more sukuk will be issued under 144A regulations, the documentation and transparency levels of which will boost demand across geographies and investor types.
Second, the US will become a leading target for sukuk issuers, and as familiarity with the asset class increases, the investor base will broaden.
Finally, the emergence of private banking investors will open another investor segment that will require its own marketing and approach.

Change happens fast in today’s global, Internet-driven economy. Learn how to get ahead of these changes—and your competitors—by creating irresistible value for your customers.
In an era of globalization and internet commerce, salespeople (and the companies they work for) are in danger of becoming irrelevant. In this Darwinian environment, the traditional approach of selling solutions to problems no longer creates profitable differentiation. To survive, salespeople must become agents of change and help customers achieve their goals rather than simply solve their problems. This new, change-centric approach is the next evolution in selling and leadership, enabling companies to develop deeper, more profitable customer relationships and enabling leaders to be more agile and adaptive to changing conditions.
With twenty years of experience, most recently with Microsoft, Brett Clay has developed a complete tool-set for change-centric salespeople and executives, including 101 secrets for growing sales and delivering high value to customers. Readers will understand the five disciplines of change leadership and the secrets of change psychology that will turn them into vital assets for their customers and help them achieve explosive sales growth.
”This powerful, practical book shows you how to make more sales, faster and easier than you ever thought possible!”
”This is the first POSITIVE book about change in a decade . . . at a time when we need it most! Buy it today, and implement it as fast as you can.”
“‘Selling Change’ is a handbook that shows how to lead customers or stakeholders through change and create high value for them in the process—and that’s why it’s a must-read for salespeople and business executives in 2011.”
“The biggest value is created by driving change. But now, it’s not a luxury—it’s survival. Read this book – and thrive.”
“Selling Change is an outstanding leadership handbook that all salespeople, managers, and executives should read.”
”Do you think change is scary and borders on impossible? Think again. Selling Change shows how to more effectively sell your ideas, products, and services to your employees, stakeholders, and customers. Author, Brett Clay, has translated the complex and abstract principles of change psychology into an easy-to-read, fun, and practical format that business leaders and salespeople are sure to find valuable.”
Brett Clay is CEO of Change Leadership Group, LLC, a management consulting and training firm specializing in the areas of change leadership and business performance acceleration. He is an award-winning author, award-winning marketer, international speaker, sales trainer, consultant, and a veteran of twenty years in international sales and marketing management. He has held vice president roles in sales, business development, and marketing at numerous high-technology companies and was most recently at Microsoft Corporation.
Sister Island Project is a non-profit organization dedicated to fostering respectful international friendship and cultural, educational, and technical exchange between people of the United States and people of the Dominican Republic. In addition, Sister Island Project promotes awareness of issues that challenge developing countries and collaborates with Dominicans on mutually beneficial humanitarian projects.
Sister Island Project is currently focusing its resources on two related goals -- creating a learning center and fostering cultural exchange. In collaboration with Dominican community organizations and international supporters, we are working to create a learning center in the Yabacao region of the Dominican Republic.
This learning center will provide secondary and vocational education for Yabacaos youth and will also provide educational opportunities for the general community in academics, vocational skills, nutrition, and arts. The center will also serve as a hurricane shelter. Ecological sustainability is a central value in planning for the centers design and curriculum.
Our second, related goal is the facilitation of cultural exchange, through volunteer service by Americans and others. Exposure to diversity and the development of cross-cultural communication skills are urgent needs for Americans, never more so than in this post-9/11 world. There is a real call for us to become "global citizens." Sister Island Projects service opportunities allow volunteers from the United States and elsewhere to teach, learn, and step beyond the familiar. In doing so, volunteers become wiser, more capable citizens of the world. Likewise, our host families have the opportunity to feel respected and competent and engaged, hosting guests from far away. Dominican children receive a valuable educational opportunity while they share their culture and develop skills in relating to volunteers from the United States and elsewhere.
In this framework of mutually beneficial cultural exchange, Americans and Dominicans are working together to create a school in an impoverished community.

Fassbinder's debut feature, in which he also stars, is a stark, powerful crime drama that introduces many of his major themes.
This is a prodigious debut film, a revisionist film noir as stark in its visual style as it is powerful in its seething, but repressed, emotions, and with a wonderfully sardonic sense of humor. Even as it draws on his work in theatre (Fassbinder had already written and/or directed over a dozen stage productions), Love is Colder Than Death points to the forty films which were to come in terms of its themes, aesthetic techniques, and psychological insights. But this is no mere warm-up for later triumphs (and tribulations); it seems more resonant with each subsequent viewing.
Love is Colder Than Death opens at the threadbare offices of a crime syndicate, where  in between brutal interviews with the bosses  small-time Munich pimp Franz Walsch (played by Fassbinder, although uncredited) strikes up a friendship with Bruno (Ulli Lommel), another young recruit. Relishing his independence, Franz refuses to join the mob, despite their promises of more money and security. He returns to his prostitute girlfriend Joanna (Hanna Schygulla), and they continue their desultory relationship. Bruno tracks Franz down for enigmatic reasons: Is it because he already feels drawn to Franz, or has he been sent by the syndicate  or both? Franz, Bruno, and Joanna go on a small wave of shoplifting and murder. But when Bruno begins planning a bank robbery, Joanna's distrust and jealousy of him cause her to make some arrangements of her own.
Here is the compositionally simple but highly evocative first shot. Fassbinder immediately throws us into a kind of limbo. We do not know where we are or why we are there. All we see are two men  with Fassbinder (as Franz) turned toward us, reading a paper and smoking  as they sit and wait... and wait... and wait. For what? The huge expanse of empty, pale wall seems to trap them  like a prison cell without any bars  as it sublminally increases our tension about what will happen next. Shot in harsh black and white by his frequent early cinematographer Dietrich Lohmann, Fassbinder designed this film (with co-star Ulli Lommel) and edited it, using his frequent pseudonym of none other than Franz Walsch. With this first scene, he establishes the often slow, deliberate pacing, and almost hypnotic performance style, which he wants for this film. Although this opening is expository  setting up the central characters and their violent, though often lethargic milieu  as the picture unfolds, we will see that the many lengthy passages without dialogue can grip us through the force of unspoken desires, even as the severe images hold us at a distance.
We are very fortunate to have Fassbinder's own thoughts on this film (one of only a handful where that is the case); and I will draw on "The Kind of Rage I Feel: A Conversation with Joachim von Mengershausen about Love is Colder Than Death " (reprinted in The Anarchy of the Imagination: Interviews, Essays, Notes  Rainer Werner Fassbinder , edited by Michael Tötenberg and Leo A. Lensing) throughout this review. When the interviewer asked Fassbinder, in May 1969, if the austere tone of this film "would seem to pretty much kill off any emotion," he replied: "You have a plot. Language. Sound and music, all of which create emotion. But the relationship between these three elements won't let the audience take the easy way out. In my opinion, it's really a film the audience won't have an easy time with, but actually quite a hard one. My film isn't supposed to let feelings people already have be neutralized or soaked up; instead, the film should create new feelings.... I'm concerned with having the audience ... examine its own innermost feelings.... To me that's more political, or politically more aggressive and active, than if I point out [a particular group] as the great oppressors."
Fassbinder has nailed many key aspects not only of this film, but of his entire body of work. Of course his style would change, sometimes radically (compare this film and, say, the ribald farce Satan's Brew ), but the intention was always for us to use the film as a way of probing our society and ourselves.
One aspect of Fassbinder's genius, which you can see here and throughout all of his works, is the way he infuses even simple elements with many thematic and emotional layers. As you look more closely at those layers, they often seem more complex, even contradictory; yet they are almost always involving. Take the plot of this film, which I summarized above. On the one hand, it could hardly be more simple. Yet although the structure is clear, even classical in its construction (exposition, rising action, climax), it holds many genuine, and purposeful, mysteries of character. One example is the pivotal character of Joanna. Although Fassbinder discusses her in the interview, his own analysis still leaves room for our own interpretations. He says that Joanna is "the key to everything. [S]he... is totally bogged down in bourgeois values  much, much worse than all the others. That's what she wants to preserve, and that's the reason she betrays [Bruno] to the police, because she'd rather be alone than be part of a threesome; that she just can't handle."
Joanna marks the first role played by the luminous Hanna Schygulla in a Fassbinder film; she would go on to appear  and usually to star  in half of his pictures, including several of his best (here is the complete list). Schygulla's performance is extraordinarily nuanced, bringing out all of the layers of the character which Fassbinder wrote for her. (Just think of the countless stereotyped "hookers" you have seen in movies, to appreciate their achievement.) There is never a moment that we do not feel Schygulla living the depths of her conflicted character, from her desire for a stable life with Franz (what Fassbinder calls her "bourgeois values")  which forces her to tolerate being casually slapped in the face by "her man"  to her knotted jealousy over the growing realization of Franz's desire for Bruno is greater than what he feels for her. What adds yet another level to the film is that Joanna's perceptions of Franz and Bruno's never-articulated desire seems greater than what the men themselves are capable of expressing.
Although Fassbinder admitted that "There's a homosexual component, much more obvious than with Hawks, for instance," he does not elaborate in his comments on this fundamental theme of his film. (For the record, some of the great Howard Hawks's most homosocial films would include 1928's A Girl in Every Port and 1948's Red River , not to mention his many pictures centering on all-male groups). The unspoken relationship  the desire  between Franz and Bruno is the core of Love is Colder Than Death .
The openly-gay Fassbinder focused on same-sex relationships in only a very few of his films: the lesbian and bisexual women in The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant , a transsexual in In a Year of 13 Moons , and the gay men in Fox and His Friends (starring Fassbinder) and Querelle . But homoerotic undercurrents  often very subtle  play a crucial role in many of his films. To take just one instance, in the climactic supermarket scene in Gods of the Plague (the sequel to this film) note the body language and eye contact of Franz Walsch (the same character as here, but played by Harry Baer) and the store manager: It seems clear that they have had some kind of intimate relationship, and that that allows the manager to lower his guard, even as Franz and his new partner suddenly draw their guns for the holdup (I will discuss this scene more fully in my review of that film). In Love is Colder Than Death , much of the film's rich emotional subtext comes from the deep, unspoken feelings between Franz and Bruno. But before exploring that dimension of the film  which I believe ties together many of its major thematic, stylistic, and emotional components  let us look at the film in a broader context.
For his feature debut, Fassbinder set out to make a personal film on the limited budget of DEM 95,000 (then US $27,500) given to him by a wealthy admirer: "She gave [the money] to us and said, 'If the movie makes a profit, you can pay me back, and if it doesn't, never mind.'" The cast and crew, drawn largely from Fassbinder's Anti-Theater collective, worked for minimal salaries and profit participation. As with many of his later films, he would work within a clearly-defined genre: Here, he chose the gangster picture. As he said, "I enjoy seeing crime films, and I think other people enjoy seeing crime films, too. Besides, I meant to send a message [that the everyday oppression people experience is criminal]. I could always make a film that would have everything in it that this film has for me, but in a completely different form [ NOTE : He may have been looking ahead to his next film, Katzelmacher ].... I chose a crime plot because that kind of story is easy to tell. And I'm all for making simple things. But they have to be beautiful too." The interviewer, like many people seeing the film, pointed out that Love is Colder Than Death is not a simple film. Fassbinder admitted, "That does bother me.... One problem is, all those Hollywood movies are right smack in our way, and all we can do is react to them, primarily in terms of form. It so happens there really are a lot of beautiful films in the detective genre."
This film takes on added power if seen in the tradition of the crime film, including such landmark  not to mention homoerotic  works as Mervyn LeRoy's Little Caesar (1930; the Edward G. Robinson character cannot shoot his partner Joe, despite the deadly consequences, saying, "This is what I get for liking a guy too much"), Charles Vidor's Gilda (1946; note the intimate bond between the Glenn Ford and George Macready characters), Raoul Walsh's White Heat (1949; with enough Freudian subtext to fill a dozen analysts' coaches  also the director may have inspired Fassbinder's "Walsch" pseudonym), and Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train (1951; whose debonair psychopath Bruno, played by Robert Walker, may have given his name to Fassbinder's quite different character). Fassbinder was also drawn to the brilliant French New Wave revisionist crime films of Jean-Luc Godard, whose Breathless (1959) and Band of Outsiders (1964) are a major influence here, as they were on Fassbinder's second short film, "The Little Chaos", made just three years earlier (its essentially light-hearted tone is a far cry from what we have in this film).
While looking at the influences on this film, let us note Fassbinder's eclectic dedication  to three well-known filmmakers and to two obscure characters: "To Claude Chabrol, Eric Rohmer, Jean-Marie Straub, Linio and Cuncho."
Although Fassbinder tellingly omitted Godard (who may have been uncomfortably  and with his exalted reputation, intimidatingly  close to his own vision at this point), he dedicated this film to two other New Wave auteurs, Claude Chabrol ( Le Beau Serge , Les Bonnes Femmes ), who makes virtually nothing but crime films, and Eric Rohmer ( La Collectionneuse , My Night at Maud's ), whose pictures explore the intricacies of human relationships. But perhaps their dedication was as much in deference to their pioneering 1957 study, Hitchcock  which elevated him, and by extension the crime genre, from pop culture to Art (capital "A")  as to their films; although elements of their styles can be seen here. The other of this film's five dedicatees were his mentor, stage and film director Jean-Marie Straub ( The Diary of Anna Magdalena Bach , Moses und Aron  which was one of Fassbinder's 10 favorite operas), and two movie characters (misidentified) as "Cuncho" and "Linio." They appear in Quien sabe? (literally "Who knows?"; the U.S. title is A Bullet for the General ), a 1967 spaghetti Western directed by Damiano Damiani featuring the gun-running bandit El Chuncho [the name refers to savage native tribes in South America's eastern Andes region; note the spelling] and the young "gringo" he affectionately nicknames El Niño (because of his boyish looks, which of course mask treachery; this would be Fassbinder's "Linio"), played by none other than Lou Castel, who would soon portray the petulant Fassbinder-like director in Beware of a Holy Whore , which itself is Fassbinder's self-satire on the making of Whity , his own  what I've dubbed  'sauerkraut Western.' How's that for "footnoting"?)
Fassbinder turns the crime film on its ear, as only an original artist who knew a genre inside out could. Although he created arguably one of the most visually stunning "traditional" films noir in Gods of the Plague , here he eschews all of the familiar stylistic cues. Instead of ominous shadows, everything is hit with icy-cold light, so there is nowhere to hide. Instead of the baroque, sometimes dizzying, deep-focus compositions of such 1950s masterpieces as Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly , Kubrick's The Killing , and Welles's Touch of Evil , Fassbinder puts us in a world of intense flatness, with rarely more than two or three planes of action. Ironically, the only places where you can find depth of space are the centers of consumerism, such as the sunglasses shop (presided over by another of Fassbinder's best actresses, Irm Hermann, who was also this film's assistant producer), the department store, and especially the supermarket  all of which provide Franz, Bruno, and Joanna with no impediments to their pilfering everything they want.
Despite its mood of existential urban angst, the film is all the stronger for its not infrequent ironic humor. Some of the wit takes the form of in-jokes, such as naming a sweet-faced murder victim Erika Rohmer (after the brilliant French New Wave filmmaker, and dedicatee, Eric Rohmer), or having Franz demand a pair of sunglasses "just like the ones the cop wore in Psycho " (that gag is compounded when the cop they kill, later in the film, bears a close resemblance to the one in Hitchcock's film). Perhaps funniest scene  and it is very, very funny  occurs as Joanna, in her mini-skirt, and Bruno, in his trenchcoat and noirish fedora, glide up and down the aisles of a cavernous supermarket, stealing everything that catches their eye  all to the strains of an electronic version of what sounds like Richard Strauss's opera Der Rosenkavalier . To top the scene, when they have lifted all they possibly can, they proceed to the checkout counter and buy just one item: A package of toilet paper!
Despite those few scenes of literal spatial depth  and sometimes humor  the film's world is mostly one of crushing emptiness, from the lengthy sequence of Bruno's night drive along Munich's creepy, almost-deserted streets (accompanied only by Peer Raben's haunting score) to the sprawling, yet spatially constricted, garbage dump where Bruno takes one of Joanna's johns to kill him. Combined with the measured pacing and almost-hypnotic stylization of the performances, this sometimes feels like a ghostly  if not exactly a 'ghost'  picture; as if these characters were haunting the same scenes, repeating the same actions again and again, stuck in a kind of purgatory. And although the almost uncanny mood of the opening scene might lend a bit of credence to what I admit is a pretty far-fetched interpretation, let me note that Fassbinder went on to make several other "ghostly pictures" throughout his career, including  to name just those titles released on DVD up through July 2003  The American Soldier (but not Gods of the Plague ), Whity (in which the entire doomed Nicholson family wears ghostly white makeup throughout the film), Effi Briest , Fear of Fear , Chinese Roulette (which may end with a procession of literal Nazi ghosts), and to an extent, The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant .
Pseudo-supernaturalism aside, Fassbinder brilliantly (and economically) uses these stark settings  of which the most oppressively sterile environment is Franz's barely furnished apartment, where much of the film is set  to convey not only the social status of his characters, but their emotional states too. That design parallels the many silences which punctuate the film: The glances, the gestures, and the surface stillness  masking the inner turmoil  of the characters. Few films so resolutely demand that we enter into characters, to "hear" what they are thinking and feeling, when they are saying literally nothing. Fassbinder achieves that by uniting empathy and distance in ways that are complex, involving, and disturbing  since we can never forget that these are petty thieves and casual murderers.
The six killings are shot in the same flat, uninflected style as the decor. Although when a character dies there is always a sense of playacting as they crumple to the ground  a technique well-known from Breathless  Fassbinder significantly eschews the jazzy energy of Godard. As Fassbinder noted, "I made... the murder scenes as conventional as possible.... That's supposed to show that criminality isn't muggings and murders, but rather people being raised in such a way that they have the kinds of relationships these people have, that they're simply incapable of getting their relationships straightened out.... [that they] simply don't have any options."
That comment brings us back to something else suggested by all of those blank walls: Repression, specifically that of 'the love that dare not speak its name.' One can only speculate how differently these characters would have lived if Franz and Bruno could have expressed their feelings for each other; or if Joanna and the men could have found a workable living arrangement (such as the one depicted in Gods of the Plague between Franz, his friend Gorilla, and Margarethe). Instead, these people are trapped in a silent hell, not only of society's making (although clearly Fassbinder places most of the blame there) but of their own fear. The final image encapsulates the contradictory nature of the film, and its characters: Dynamic, with the composition's powerful lines converging in the left of the frame (where Franz's car has driven off), yet static, as the camera holds for a long time and the image slowly fades to a ghostly white (Fassbinder also brilliantly employed this device throughout Effi Briest ).
While rewatching this film (several times), I wondered why I cared so much about these posturing petty thieves and casual murderers. Then I realized that I was responding to their vulnerability, which was unique for each character yet also a common quality. Though they never talk about their frustrated desires and dreams  and of course that silence adds to the film's power  we see that these are terribly wounded people, with no idea of how to heal themselves. So they act out their own pain through robbing and killing  using generic criminal identities provided by Hollywood (not to mention Godard)  even as these victims of society victimize each other, and of course themselves. Fassbinder does not excuse these characters, but he does bring them to life as complex, humanly contradictory people.
There is even greater poignancy because they are all so young, yet already incapable of expressing emotion over the murders they commit. In a strange yet brilliantly insightful way, all of those blank walls  echoing their emptiness and pain  made me care about them even more. When Franz frisks Bruno [see the first frame at the top of this review], I was rooting for it to turn into an embrace. When Franz slaps Joanna  after she turns away from Bruno, whom Franz had sent to her  he says he did it, "Because you laughed at Bruno and Bruno's my friend": But I wish he could have understood the knotted, frustrated emotions which led to his brutality, that he could have explained to Joanna, and himself, what he was feeling  and what he wished he could feel openly  and genuinely begged for her forgiveness. But part of the power of Fassbinder's characters, both here and in his later films, comes precisely from their inability to articulate what it is they want. I realize that these comments make me sound like a bleeding-heart sentimentalist; but I believe that, at heart, so was Fassbinder, at least in terms of one key aspect of his work. Beneath all the tension, frustration, anger and violence (he made this film, he said, because "I want [people] to experience the kind of rage I feel" [at social injustice]), this film is the vision of a utopian dreamer, an idealist who hopes that by clearing away the crushing detritus of our culture, we can find our way out of a self-lacerating condition where "love is colder than death," and one day achieve a genuinely humane world.
Fassbinder set out to make a film about the social and personal conditions which give rise to crime, even as he tried to compel the audience to "examine [our] innermost feelings." I think he has succeeded, not only sociologically but artistically, capturing - through narrative, performance, and design  the blank poetry of oppression, and repression. And in the other two films featuring Franz Walsch, Gods of the Plague and The American Soldier , he will explore the even darker sides of the phenomenon. Of course, with this feature debut he also wanted to astonish the world with a striking new vision of a well-established genre; so he must have been delighted with the near-riot  between his already-polarized champions and detractors  it caused at the 1969 Berlin Film Festival.
Today, a third of a century after that fateful premiere, Love is Colder Than Death still feels fresh, strange, and resonant in its chillingly casual violence and unspoken, sometimes heartbreaking, passion.

JERSEY CITY – Local religious leaders say a mega-landlord has installed cameras directly in front of some tenants' doors, one month after they spoke out about being treated unfairly.
The new cameras and a proposed security system that required tenants in some buildings provide photos of their driver's licenses are the newest forms of intimidation landlord Joseph Ehrman uses, Jersey City Together said during a June 18 rally.
Ehrman, described by the group as a "predatory landlord," owns multiple management companies in Jersey City, including Sixth Boro, Optimum Property Management and Golden Apple.
JERSEY CITY - A pregnant woman and three teenagers are among six people who are in critical condition after being exposed to carbon monoxide inside an apartment building on the city's West Side, authorities said.
JERSEY CITY -- Eleven people, including a city firefighter, are being treated for carbon monoxide exposure at an apartment building on the city's West Side, officials said.
Three people who were exposed to the carbon monoxide are listed in critical condition, city spokeswoman Jennifer Morrill said.
The incident happened at 168 Harrison Ave., a 16-family residential building between Kennedy Boulevard and Bergen Avenue, at approximately 11:30 a.m.
The city's fire department and Office of Emergency Management are on scene with PSE&G and the building's management.

Yesterday was a day to celebrate “finishings.” Not only did I receive my first copy of the new CD, Shofar in the Key of Worship, but I picked up the finished printing of my other new piece, The Looking Glass! None of this would have happened if I hadn’t woken up about seven years ago and realized that I wasn’t finishing anything.
I had a computer full of starts, fragments, and near finishes that would have been deleted had I died that day. Years of work, poof! What spurred this awakening?
In a three-week period, ten friends either died or had heart attacks. Two of the heart attacks were my long-time friend and also my younger brother. That’s what I call an awakening. I fervently asked God, the author and finisher, to help me finish, and here we are! Two finished pieces and I actually recorded on a CD instead of just talking about it. A good start. Now, I am digging my heels in to record my own and to finish my first novel.
Tell me, what are your goals for the next two years? Have you filed God-given inspiration in a folder called “Mere Good Ideas”? Why not revisit them? Maybe they aren’t your ideas at all. Maybe God was the author of them. If so, then He wants to finish them if you are willing.

I listened to a cable show called Behind the Scenes Remastered while I ate breakfast this morning. They presented a fascinating story about the difficult life of the singer Meatloaf. The narrator spoke of a time “Meat” couldn’t sing anymore. When he tried to record after his first hit album, he couldn’t sing notes he used to and he had lost strength in his voice. Also he fought with his co-partner and good friend, Jim, about who should be in the band. Things seemed to be falling apart.
Meatloaf didn’t know if the problem with his voice was physical or mental, so he went to doctors, psychiatrists, and even hypnotists, but no one could help him. He was close to a nervous breakdown. He said he sat in a corner and just cried.
Times like that are when a person needs a friend the most, and his wife was that for him. She never gave up.
Eventually he found a psychiatrist who “made him face up to the life he both craved and hated.” He had gone to another psychiatrist for about a year, but this doctor walked in and said, “What’s the problem?”
Think about it. All those lies showered on us have to do with serving money. Whatever happened to the suggestion that you “seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all the things shall be added unto you”?
As believers in Jesus Christ, we know money is not our end goal. The tricky part is, though, we need money. That’s where our artistic priorities can flip over.
We all recognize the stereotypical sales people who desparately try to meet their quota. Eyes bright, they rush in. You’re their next Porterhouse steak. They say they care about what you want and may mean that, but you sense that is not 100% true. They are pressured to support their sick child at home.
Let’s be honest. Anxiety-based temptation is no different for a Christian musician, actor, painter, dancer. How do we overcome without laying aside our talents?
I’m not in denial. I need money to pay for things and to help more people. Nor am I going to decide that God will never prosper the works of my hands. But what if my works don’t support me?
Have I asked God, were they meant to right now? Or maybe someone is not willing to compensate. After all, you are a “Christian,” they say, and to them, that word means “free,” involuntarily.
Right here in this thought! God may choose to provide for us via our talents today. He may chose another way tomorrow, but He will always provide for those who serve Him. He just doesn’t always tell us how.
Let’s remind our privileged selves daily that our talents are meant to bless, heal, deliver, and set people free, not primarily to support us.
If the Lord chooses to tag on an income, we say, “Halleluia! Bring it on.” Then we share. If not, He will surely provide some other way. I have never seen the righteous forsaken.

“‘Worship happens when you sense an acute awareness of the presence of God and God senses an acute awareness of the presence of you.’” Ray Hughes
These words arrested me the first time I read them. Am I pursuing until He has a ACUTE awareness of me, his adoring daughter?
Is it not, in this place, that my praise, thanks, and requests are made known? Is it not, in this place, that I can rest in His love and sure response for the sake of His kingdom? Is this intimate communion with the Creator not the desire and purpose of an artistic person’s gifting?
Lord, give us the strength to press in until You are acutely aware of our presence, and we of Yours. Have your way with us.
Posted by Judith on Jun 28, 2013 in Practice | Comments Off on Masterful Timing: From Clay Pot to Fine China
I listened to a symphony in my car last week, amazed at the conductor’s ability to place a chord at a point in time much later than I expected, but exactly where it belonged. At the height of my anticipation, he waited still. This timing forced me, as the listener, to let go of all control and wait for him to show me where the sound needed to be.
The ability to wait until the exact moment arrives is a hallmark of a master. Whether a master dancer lowers her arm at the right speed to end well, a musician places a final note in his bed of color, a painter sees when to stop, an intercessor listens for a word from God, or a writer struggles for the perfect word, greatness is not afraid to wait for what feels like too long.
As I drove home that day, radio blaring, I realized that masterful timing is what turns a clay pot into fine china, a mediocre musician into an artist, a writer into a best-selling author. We wait and wait for dreams to come true, for God to move, for problems to be resolved, for the right gig, as if the wait were an inconvenience, an irritation. Pressure builds. Our temperature rises.
But in the kiln, fine china needs a higher temperature than clay pots; it becomes impermeable. For us, the restraint we exercise in the wait turns the heat up. We become impermeable.
All eyes may be on us, but if we allow fear to rush us, we will remain clay pots, given to soak up whatever doubt and negativity passes by.
Rather, wait. Take the heat. Become impermeable. Trust the Master’s timing. Then you will serve before kings.
Happy Birthday to sweet Harvest Sue, our PoOL mascot! At seven, she has been years of fun and a great joy.
Harvest is a worship dog. Whenever worship music fills the air at home or whenever I improvise with worship sounds, there she is, lost in the beauty of God’s Spirit. She loves the “water.” Actually, as a new pup, the breeder said she slept in the water bowl.
If she could type, I think she would say to you: “Play! Play every day! Even training can be fun. And remember this, you furless, hind-leg-walking, funny-looking animal, you: What feels like sacrifice and tough discipline brings great reward. I’d drop a million wild pheasants in my master’s hand just to feel his stroke across my head, and under my ears, and oh-h…that’s feels so good!”
Posted by Judith on May 7, 2013 in Technology | Comments Off on Patience is a virtue I have to pray for
Used to be I’d walk out on stage and play. Not now. Links, and website plug-ins, and Word Press, and audio players – we have to have them all for our online audience, they say.
It can become a time-eating, tech monster. And I can become impatient. Add the new software releases and updates we have to learn, the xlr cables, mic splitters and microverbs, plus our family demands, community service, writers’ groups, friendships, and my dog’s insistence that she has to control everyone who walks by while I’m writing or practicing-little people, big people, curly or straight-haired dogs, brown trucks that stop in front of our house – and it’s no wonder I am only now, at 64, getting a website going for my music and writing with one very long sentence for which I have gathered words for years, waiting for this very moment.
As I wade through this ever-changing world of technology, I’m trying not to take on too much. Or not to get too excited so my eyes get wild and I forget what’s important. I need patience – a virtue I have to pray for.
Not encouraged to pursue a career in music as a child, I lacked a mother’s blessing, that is until 2009. Waiting at an elevator in China after a group breakfast, international ministry leader, Marilyn Hickey, said to me, ”That was so-o-o anointed, so anointed!”
I doubt Marilyn was as surprised as I, who was still a tad nervous from the risk I’d taken. Crazy, but I had played a $5 Hulusi souvenir at the tour’s last worship time. What seemed crazy was I only had fifteen minutes in private to learn how to play it and this was an international ministry tour breakfast at which I was to play.
You might think so, but I’d learned the principle behind the anointing. Before I played I said: ”I’ve learned not to play for people. I play for God for people. Hand Him your requests, and I’ll play.”
As I played for God like a little child with a new toy, I was surprised to see a few people break into tears; others worshiped. One woman in particular recounted a deep personal healing that amazed me.
The truth sunk deeper: It is not about an expensive instrument, the right mouthpiece, fame, or hours of practice and Bible reading, though those are very helpful. It is all and only about the anointing of Jesus Christ’s power in and through a willing musician, writer, dancer.

Well the first question I have to ask is: Are they going to be compelled to go? If one of the few should express a great concern about the idea would he/she be forced to man up?
In fact I believe if they asked for volunteers they might be overwhelmed by the number of our brave lads & lasses clamouring to offer their services.
This particular accessory are really hard to come by now. Here are improved DML MG Gun Barrel cases. Heavily weathered!
Improved DML E-tools by adding wood grain, thinning down the metel shovel piece and adding of dirt. Next is painting the shovels and then washing the units with oil paints.
This is a straight forward improvement to my custom M40 helmets, but not so straight forward in getting the material
After DML released their version of the camouflage netting, i was always looking for something better - took me a while to look for a substitute and when i found it, i immediately got this done!
These are improved and repainted DML gas mask cannister &amp; Gas cape bags. In the picture you could see 3 different type of colors - German Grey, Field Grey and Dark Yellow. Also some chipped paints and weathering to depict use/wear. Silk ribbons were used to replicate the sling.
Here are M42 helmets painted in Field Grey (right) and German Grey (left) with Foliage Camo Wiring . I used garden wires for wiring. The diameter of the wires were chosen carefully - not too big not too small. I really love the results.
Every 1/6th collector I know loves a sniper gun, I am no exception :) . With all the excitement from DML’s release of a sniper figure recently boosted my spirit to custom and improve this rifle.
This rifle is a DML older version of a KAR 98 with a sniper scope. Improvements were made as below :-
I made quite a bit of research on the scope and I identified the scope type is an Ajack 4 x 90 Sniper Scope. More research was done on the leather lens protector.
I made this improvement over the weekend - its very challenging as this is an improved 21st century G43. Honestly I do prefer 21st over others due to the overall size - DML's seemed bulkier.
Improvements - removal of mold marks, creating the wood grain, painting the wood section and the metal parts of the rifle and replacing the sling.
Similar to the sniper KAR 98, I had the mold marks removed, created the wood grains, repainted and replaced the sling. The side mounted bubble sight has been modified to be movable.
I’m really happy with this custom. I have always wanted improve helmet with covers without the fabric looking too thick and distorting the shape of the helmet. Here’s the best way I figured :)
The cover is a reworked DML’s Oak Leaf (Summer) Pattern cover and the core helmet is a DML’s M40 helmet.
Improvements – this is kinda a long process. Firstly I removed the stitching around the rims of the covers, removed the hook covers and also the hook. Next I stained the fabric with oil paint – raw umber and burnt umber. Once dried, I spray on a thick layer of hair spray. Next I did some light sanding before I attached the covers to the helmet. The covers were neatly glued at the rim with the excess fabric tucked in. Next I fabricated hooks using pins to be attached a the 3 locations at the helmet rim. Lastly I created the strap. Sounds like a lot of work eh? It is … :P

Castello Estense, или замок Сан-Микеле, является самым значительным памятником города Феррара и находится прямо в историческом центре. Крепость была построена в 1385 году Николо II д'Эсте, чтобы защитить себя от нападений самих граждан, которые были в общем недовольстве правительством Эстенси. Люди, измученные голодом и нищетой, объединили свои силы, чтобы убить Томмазо да Тортона, магистрата Giudici dè Savi, которого ненавидели все. Затем он присоединился, чтобы свергнуть монархию семьи Эсте, светского мастера Феррары. Замок Эстенсе был спроектирован придворным архитектором Бартолино да Новара, который построил его вокруг Торре-дей-Леони. Таким образом, здание представляло собой квадратный план с четырьмя угловыми башнями, соединенными между собой стенами занавеса. Здание было построено всего за два года и оснащено канавой по всему периметру, несколькими разводными мостами и другими современными системами обороны. Возведенный по соображениям военной защиты, начиная с середины пятнадцатого века, с Геракла II, взял на себя роль придворной резиденции для лордов города. В подполье находились тюрьмы, в древней легенде которых рассказывается о трагической любовной истории Уго и Паризины, соответственно старшего сына и второй жены маркиза Николо III, которые были посажены в тюрьму в Торре деи Леони перед выполнением. В тот раз, когда ярость предательства его жены Паризины, Николай III убил всех прелюбодейных женщин Феррары; Сказано поэтому, что в тюрьмах замка есть два призрака, которые все еще плачут внутри душ женщин, которые умерли из-за них.

Do any of these words come to mind when you think about growing your church’s expressiveness in worship? If so, you’re not alone. As worship leaders, most of us long to see our church engaged in worship. We long to see our congregation move away from passivity and apathy in worship and towards physical expression that points to an inward transformation and adoration of Jesus. Oftentimes, there’s a disconnect between what we long for in our hearts and what we see with our eyes.
Over the last couple of years, I’ve seen God move in incredible ways in our church body, and as a result, we’ve seen expressiveness and spiritual vitality grow in our worship gatherings. I believe God Himself is leading us on a journey of discovering what it means to worship in spirit and truth, and I hope our journey can bring some encouragement to yours.
The most common word used for worship in the New Testament is proskyneo, which means to kiss. In context, it means to prostrate oneself on the ground and kiss the feet of the One being worshipped. All throughout scripture, we are either seeing examples of physical expressiveness in worship or being called to physical expressiveness in worship (Psalm 47:1, Psalm 134:2). We, as leaders, must continually be asking ourselves:
Are we teaching our teams and congregations to worship God how they want to worship Him, or are we teaching them how He desires to be worshipped in accordance with scripture?
If you’re married, you probably had to learn in your first year of marriage how to love your spouse the way he/she wants to be loved (I’m four years in and still learning this!). A grave mistake we can make is to love our spouses the way WE want to love them. Same goes with friendships and other relationships. Similarly, we must learn how to love God the way He wants to be loved. And God is an expressive God, and desires we worship him with singing, lifted hands, clapping, and humbled hearts.
So, is the secret to change our behavior? Are lifted hands and raised voices the end-all-be-all to a spiritually vibrant worship culture? No, what we need is not a change of behavior, but a change of mindset, ultimately leading to a shift in behavior.
Chances are you have people on your worship team who are more reserved. Maybe they aren’t expressive because “that’s just not who they are” and although you’ve encouraged them to engage, they simply won’t because it would be “inauthentic.” Here’s how I would gently respond to that mindset:
It is possible to deny with our culture what we declare with our message. If we preach God as an extravagant and generous Father while we selfishly withhold what God has given us, we are denying with our culture what we are declaring with our message, thus making our message void to every hearer. This has massive implications for us as worship leaders and musicians. If we are singing a song like “The Stand” and proclaiming “I’ll stand, with arms high and heart abandoned” but aren’t modeling this with our body language and facial expression, we are denying with our bodies what we are declaring with our voices. If we do this often enough, our noble intensions will actually have a reverse effect on our church — our worship will appear inauthentic and lifeless. Our congregation, especially those that are naturally more expressive, will say “Do they really understand what they are singing?”
We must affirm with our culture what we declare with our message. And we must model with our expression what we are singing in the lyrics.
I also want to speak to the active role congregation members play in encouraging expressiveness in worship and affirming our message. Every Sunday, there are people walking into our church with heavy, broken, and weary hearts. And worship, coupled with the physical expression of worshipers and the presence of God, has the ability to raise everyone’s affections and bring joy to people’s hearts, including our own.
Here are three steps that I’ve seen our church take that has led to biblically-sound, gospel-centered expressiveness in worship.
1. Change your vocabulary. “Well, our people just don’t worship that way. Our congregation just isn’t on fire for God.” If you ever say this statement you will unfortunately be right. Your lack of faith becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. To paraphrase Craig Groeshcel, maybe you should start saying “I, as a leader, haven’t led our church to be physically expressive.” It’s time to take responsibility for our church’s spiritual health and vibrancy. Your church’s worship culture won’t change overnight, but I encourage you to lay out a plan and take some steps towards growing your church’s expression today!
2. Become the culture you want to see. Do you want to see your church lift their hands, sing at the top of their voice, and passionately pour out their praise to God? Here’s how: start doing it yourself. A common leadership principle is that what leaders do in excess, others will do in moderation. As a worship leader and musician, expressing your worship takes vulnerability and courage. People may look at you weird, but I promise that if you press in with confidence and are truly worshiping God, over time they will be the ones who feel weird.
3. Lead songs in a way that encourages physical expression. If you’re a practical person like me, this point is for you. Here’s a few very practical things you can do to encourage physical expression while leading worship.
• When approaching an ending chorus the church knows well, say “Come on church, you lead it!” Then begin to sing the last chorus and back away from the microphone, letting the congregation lead the song.
• If leading a song with background vocalists (we have 4 on a Sunday) have one or two of them sing the melody with you. Then towards the end of the song start to ad-lib a little more. Stop singing the lead melody and start to say the line before the church sings it. For example, when leading the song “Do It Again” by Elevation Worship, on the last chorus I will say “You promise still stands” right before the chorus comes in, and then let the background vocalists take the lead. You can even start to praise God with whatever words might come to mind. I might step back a bit from the microphone and start to sing “Your are always faithful God! You have never failed me! I will hold to your promises!” This encourages your congregation to not fall into the trap of reciting words on a screen, but to actively engage with God and express their heart to Him.
• Say “we lift our hands and sing!” before a chorus. I always encourage worship leaders to use the word “we” when possible. Saying “church, lift your hands and sing” can sometimes reinforce an Us vs. Them view of worship. Using the word “we” helps strengthen a gathered-family feel in worship.
In the words of one of my favorite Matt Redman tunes, “Lord, send revival, start with me.” As we seek to raise the affections of our church towards Jesus, may we ourselves pursue the Lord wholeheartedly with vulnerability and courage.

It appears as though it won't be long until executive Yorgos Lanthimos delivers a film that truly associates with a bigger group of onlookers. His third element, "Dogtooth, " earned an Academy Award assignment for Best Foreign Language Film in 2010. It didn't win that year, yet it was just the fifth Greek film at any point selected in the classification, and the first since 1977. That was sufficient to influence individuals to pay heed to his exceptionally remarkable style of narrating. At the point when his abnormal however convincing film "The Lobster" hit in 2015, Lanthimos scored another Oscar assignment. This time for Original Screenplay.
A year ago's "The Killing of a Sacred Deer" was unquestionably polarizing, however its screenplay win and Palme d'Or designation at Cannes demonstrated that there are many individuals out there who truly appreciate what Lanthimos is doing. Also, now he brings something that is by all accounts altogether different. Where his past work has been set in something of current or not so distant future oppressed worlds, "The Favorite" is a period piece with a quite certain setting and authentic setting. Uniting Oscar victors Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz, and blending them with fantastic Olivia Colman appears like a triumphant mix. Particularly when you consider the immense work Colman and Weisz as of now got to grandstand in their past coordinated effort with Lanthimos.
This is likewise a story that isn't troubled by immersion. Without a doubt, there are a considerable measure of movies about rulers. What's more, a great deal of those either recount the stories of the incredible rulers like Henry VIII or Elizabeth I. The court of King Louis XVI makes for a fascinating content. In any case, the account of Queen Anne is one that has just truly been investigated in constrained measurements. Also, it is an extremely convincing story that includes political interest, contending royals, and a Glorious Revolution. Between a splendid cast and a skilled chief who isn't anxious about attempting new things, "The Favorite" appears to be ready to make a few waves.
Furthermore, when you factor in the potential for staggering ensembles by none other than three-time Oscar victor Sandy Powell, in addition to eighteenth century motivated creation outline Fiona Crombie, this might just be the venture that drives Lanthimos into another level of movie producers. As of now said above, Lanthimos can be a polarizing producer. His movies don't really engage an expansive cross-area of cinephiles or Oscar voters. This could fall into the class of another film grasped by his fans, yet rejected by others as basically "excessively peculiar. "What's amazing about this film - and a potential risk - is the way that Lanthimos did not compose the screenplay.

[Edit: sorry to have taken so long in publishing this since the italian version: been busy in my job and in real life.]
I would have liked to start this thread with some mythological tone, such as Conan the barbarian and similars, talking about heirs to the throne, heritages, traditions and other stuff like that: i sincerely admit i was tempted to do so.
It is nonetheless that the sourceforge page of what has announced this week from Damocles as Anubis OS, the latest incarnation inspired by Amiga OS, based on a Linux kernel and with a Graphic subsystem that, according to the Anubis mailing list, should be based on xcb,xlib and a mix of Glib/Gtk and Zune. Further details have been explained here.
In short, is their intention to do with Amiga OS what has been done from Apple in OS X: somebody already uised the term "carbonize".
From what both Michal and m0ns00n (Hogne Titlestad) told me, the main reason that make them start the project has been an essential steadfastness from other AROS developers towards more innovative goals: Damocles already complained about the conservative approach of many of the core developers. as i wrote here.
So, Michal, together with m0ns00n and Damocles started to define the base functionalities and requirements of Arix. Michal will begin tu put full steam on it once the Efika port will be done; task that is bringing along the comppletion of the USB mass-storage bounty, another important requirement.
In a following IRC chat session, Michal told me how Amiga OS seems to have an history of lost opportunities, both for management and markerting mistakes, but also for ego trips and "balcanization" of the resources. He thinks at ARIX (sorry i dont like the name Anubis OS too much) as the Amiga OS that should have been, with resource tracking, protected memory and all those features that first Amiga OS then AROS were unable/unwilling to develop for the known reasons.
Michal is a pragmatic person and for him the usual debate about whether if you use a POSIX kernel in an Amiga OS that ceases to be an Amiga OS is or not is over: he decided that it is and, i hope, wil prove it quite good in the future.
Anyway, has to be known that Anubis OS cannot be considered an AROS fork: technically AFAIK a fork happens when a project is duplicated and modified but, being Anubis based in a different kernel, figures as an indipendent project.
The announcement was taken not too good from the amiga boards: for the aforementioned reasons above and for the cronical lack of development that is afflicting all incarnations of Amiga OSes, a heavy FUD cloud spreaded around, like has rarely been seen before. The maini nconcern among other amiga users is the runaway of the already few developers towards a system that might not even reach an usable state, and the progressive death of the already existing systems.
Luckilly, open source projects hardly die: they might become unmantained until somebody else starts again to take care of it or integrates the code in their own project; luckilly for AROS this fate looks far from happening: the project look active as ever so far, and hoping this state will last.
And, like to show that AROS, despite the imminent departure of "Doctor" Schulz and the announced "pregnancy" (kitty is a female cat :P) is still vital, let's talk about the so-far spiritual heeir of the Doctor: Stanislaw Sszymczyk that, according to its job for the self-compilation bounty, now almost [edit: no more almost: done!!!] finished has achieved considerable result, such as:
Beside that, sszy also standardised the development packages in the variuous port of AROS under GCC 4.2.2 and included their compilation in the AROS build system in order to have a system of compilers and cross-compilers built for all targets.
Furthermore, Stanislaw gave a look to the sources of Netsurf and OWB; beside some minor issues, the browser can be ported quite easily starting from the OS4 port if the GUI was not a ReAction one; so Stanislaw is looking for someone (looks like o1i might help, and i want to mention ShinkurO due to its experience on workarounds for the zune bugs) to help hm in doing a zune GUI for it.
The OWB port looks a bit more complicated due to the fact that the Gladelib port is required under AROS and so far sszy was unable to do the port.
Another important update comes from the API completion report: Krzysztof Smiechowicz completed its review job that kept him busy since last april; according to its data the completion level of AROS is around 80%. This report is also the ground for a concrete roadmap to follow so that a version 1.0 of AROS will be available in a more human timelapse.
And is also a good step that finally in the mailing list somebody is starting to talk about the strong need for documentation. Krisztof Smiechowicz has already started in adding documentation on the ABI v1 here and hopefully some more important documentations will continue to come soon.
At last look also that somebody will finally take care of the printer.device in a laid back timing; about me i was looking and sent cdocumentation to the guy interrested to help himin the development, included the old Ghostscript port on AROS now no longer working [edit: seems a new port is on the way]; lets hope to see something soon.

Napoleon Bonaparte has been too often the victim of biographical revisionism that treats him either as a demi-god or as devil incarnate. In the first of this monumental two-volume biography, Robert Asprey has preferred to treat him as a human being, chronicling the beginning of this most extraordinary of lives, from his birth in 1769 to the historic Battle of Austerlitz in 1805, when he brilliantly defeated the Austro-Russian armies.
Based on years of research, Robert Asprey tells this remarkable tale with the even-handedness such a major historical figure deserves, presenting him as he was – a man dedicated to his vision of himself and his empire.

Each congregation needs a coordinated educational plan for the many young ladies would like to join religious life. Without such a plan, they might end up losing their vocation because of so many challenges in the world.
I have enjoyed the SLDI program which I have been in for the past year. Foremost, it was a rich experience to have an encounter with sisters from different congregations and nationalities. This included shared experiences during the learning process in class, group work, and interactions outside of class at meal time and liturgy. As I finish this program, I realize, beyond educational information, I have learned things which add to my personal growth.
On the first day of this program, we were asked to recall someone who had a significant and positive impact on our lives. I believe ASEC will be one of those I will always recall as having a significant impact on my life. In the SLDI program, I can summarize my extensive learning as follows: knowledge of basic computer, learning techniques for mentoring, stewardship as a process of demonstrating a sense of responsibility for taking care of resources, integrity as doing the right thing, leading change in management, managing resources for the common good, strategic planning, and developing visionary mission goals.
During the workshop, our coordinators made sure that we ate well, prayed and studied together, went out for group sightseeing tours, and laughed together. Classes were intensive, but there was an environment conducive for the serious studies which took place. All the materials to read for the topics to be treated were on our desk when we arrived. Laptops were provided for each one of us. The facilitators were always available to teach us, and to assist us in answering our questions. They encouraged us to share appropriate practical examples from our ministries in which we were currently involved, and to think of possible applications to future ministries. For me, I felt all of this was a good on-going formation to reinforce our calling as servant leaders wherever we find ourselves.
I wish to say thank you once again to our ASEC benefactors, coordinators and facilitators who donated their money, time, energy and experiences to us, I say “Ayikoo!” (Well done). God richly bless you all.
While grateful for all that I have already expressed, I feel the sisters in Ghana need more training in academic fields to face the challenges of our country and our world today. The educational system in Ghana is such that, without good grades from the Senior High School (SHS), you cannot continue your studies anywhere. This negatively impacts your future ministries as a religious. I am therefore pleading with ASEC, and our major superiors of the various congregations, to come to our aid by establishing an SHS in the ASEC program so that after the initial formation as a religious, the young sisters can be enrolled in this SHS to have intensive classes to enable them pass their exams well. If this SLDI workshop that we just finished were to be SHS preparation for certificate examination, we would have all passed!
Again I plead that our superiors, in collaboration with ASEC, assist sisters who have already attained their first degree, to continue studies in a variety of nearby institutions while continuing to work. This will enable the sisters to mature in carrying out multiple responsibilities. If we observe carefully, when a young sister is happy it is because she finds herself well-grounded, that is to say, she feels prepared professionally and is finding fulfillment in the life she has chosen. This strengthens her religious calling.
I am advocating in this article for acceptance consideration of all young women who feel they have a vocation to religious life, regardless of the level of education they have completed. There are means within our reach to provide all levels of education for our candidates. Each congregation needs a coordinated educational plan for the many young ladies would like to join religious life. Without such a plan, they might end up losing their vocation because of so many challenges in the world. So let’s all work together for the greater honor and glory of God! Let’s get some comprehensive educational plans in place.

Este lunes en la noche y tras casi dos semanas de incertidumbre, fue encontrada la modelo sudanesa Ataui-Deng Hopkins, quien había sido reportada como desaparecida tras salir de un club en Nueva York.
The A3 Concept is the fastest ever A3, Power comes from a 2.5 litre five-cylinder Turbo FSI engine with 402bhp and 368 lb-ft of torque, coupled to seven-speed S tronic twin clutch transmission.
The A3 Concept accelerates from 0-62mph in just 4.1 seconds and the top speed is electronically limited to 155mph. Combined fuel economy is 31mpg.
All this rides on 20-inch wheels that are molded from carbon fibre and aluminum. The production version of the A3 Saloon will arrive in 2013. For more details see the press release below.
Striking, technology-packed A3 concept combines four-door saloon practicality with 408PS five-cylinder FSI power giving 0-62mph in just 4.1 seconds
Powered by 2.5-litre five-cylinder Turbo FSI engine with 408PS and 500Nm, linked to seven-speed S tronic twin clutch transmission
In-car technology includes new generation MMI which debuts here, UMTS module accessing Google services, WLAN hotspot, Audi drive select with efficiency mode
A new take on the Audi A3 is hatched this week at the 2011 Geneva Motor Show, where for the first time in its history the ultra-successful premium compact car not only adopts a striking ‘notchback’ saloon body shell, but also uniquely combines it with a power output of over 400PS for epic performance. Known simply as the A3 concept, the fastest ever factory-produced A3 is the latest in a long line of one-off Audi design studies, and is characteristically laden with technological advances in everything from construction to infotainment.
Apart from the tautly contoured new body shell, the most immediately obvious highlight of the A3 concept is its five-cylinder Turbo FSI petrol engine, whose 408PS output outnumbers its closest series production relative, the potent RS 3 Sportback, by 68PS. Peak torque of 500Nm is also 50Nm up, and is available over a broad rev range between 1,600 and 5,300 rpm, making an explosive 4.1-second 0-62mph time a reality. Top speed is electronically limited to 155mph.
Fuel economy in this latest Audi study looks all the more impressive when these remarkable figures are taken into account, with up to 31mpg possible on the combined cycle, giving CO2 emissions of 212g/km. A regulated oil pump, the intelligent Audi thermo-management system and an energy recovery system – technologies from the brand’s modular efficiency platform – all contribute to this high efficiency. The rack-and-pinion steering also draws minimal power because its electromechanical drive system requires no energy when driving straight ahead.
A compact seven-speed S tronic twin-clutch transmission also helps to optimize efficiency, while at the same time delivering the trademark lightning-quick gear changes that are especially appropriate here.
At 4,440mm long, 1,840mm wide and just 1,390mm high, the A3 concept has a dynamic stance that suggests great agility. It can deliver on this promise thanks to the use of ultra-modern components, design methods and joining techniques. These include the use of custom-tailored blanks in the floor area, carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) in varying proportions for the grille surround, front air intake, door mirror elements, rear apron and even the 20-inch alloy wheels, and aluminium for the bonnet, doors and tailgate.
These weight-saving elements help to pare the A3 concept back to a relatively light 1,540kg, meaning its RS 3 Sportback-derived McPherson strut front and four-link rear suspension is even less encumbered through the bends. Front and rear tracks that at 1,572mm and 1,542mm are even wider than the RS 3 Sportback’s also help to plant the study even more firmly, and of course quattro permanent all-wheel drive via an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch acts as the mainstay.
The Audi drive select dynamic handling system appears for the first time in an A3, giving the driver five modes with which to fine-tune engine characteristics, power steering feel and gear shift points for the seven-speed S tronic transmission. As well as the more familiar comfort, auto, dynamic and individual settings, the latest iteration of the system features an efficiency mode designed for maximum economy.
To gain access to all this in the A3 concept, the driver need only touch the door handle with its brushed aluminium clasp. It then power extends outwards, opening the door to a futuristic cabin which, thanks to the best-in-class 2,630mm wheelbase, is also suitably spacious. This applies to the ‘boot’ as well, which offers an impressive 410-litre capacity.
Front sport seats with prominent side bolsters provide suitable anchorage for high- performance driving, and position occupants perfectly in relation to the dashboard with its aviation-inspired air vents and control knobs. The high-quality sound system features speakers in the doors and the rear shelf with aluminum trim panels, and when turned on, these extend a few millimetres to give a visual accompaniment to the system’s excellent sound.
Located behind the compact, flat-bottomed, three-spoke multifunction steering wheel are two analogue dial instruments with black dials and red needles, complemented by additional kidney-shaped displays. In between these is the large, eight-inch display for the driver information system. The display is user-programmable – the driver can select the content to be displayed from an extensive menu.
The control panel for the MMI multimedia system is located on the centre tunnel console, and for the first time the surface of its large rotary pushbutton also incorporates the touch pad for the MMI touch system which allows the driver to ‘write’ navigation destinations and other commands using a fingertip. This new solution, which makes the already exemplary MMI operation even more intuitive, will soon be introduced in series production Audi models. The ultra-thin MMI monitor power-extends out of the dashboard, another feature taken from the full-size car class. Notable new departures at this level also include the electromechanical parking brake control and the stunning LED headlights.
In terms of infotainment, the Audi A3 concept further emphasizes why the brand is one of the leaders in this field. A UMTS model provides full access to the Internet, allowing the car to access services from Google, and thanks to the WLAN hotspot, passengers can surf and send e-mail using their own computers. Holders for iPads are installed on the back of the front seat backrests.

Thirty-seven years of service in this industry has revealed many of the shortfalls and hidden problems within traditional financial plans. Most of the popular investments (such as IRAs, 401ks and 403bs) praise tax-deferral, but overlook the impact that taxes will have on your retirement income. We believe your hard work and responsible saving should be rewarded, not hindered, by Uncle Sam.
The Barber Method is a four-part strategy which reveals the truths about income planning and enables you to make informed decisions about your investments. Your plan is built with the benefit of extensive experience and knowledge about investment tax consequences. The results are customized to guide you to a tax-free retirement with financial peace of mind.
A candid conversation about retirement goals and objectives is critically important to achieving your desired lifestyle. The first step helps you establish a future retirement date and confirm your priorities. This step also addresses common myths and misperceptions that undermine future retirement income in many of today’s financial plans. We will clarify the true principles that guide investment growth. Knowing the facts will help you protect your assets, your income, and your legacy.
Every plan has a starting point. Evaluating where you are today helps to narrow the variety of available paths and establish confidence in your new direction. If you’re already accumulating savings in tax-deferred plans, we will identify the tax implications of future income. In today’s economy, innovative strategies are needed to stay a step ahead of additional uncertainties such as market volatility, inflation, and longevity. Our experience provides an informed viewpoint to help you minimize their impact on savings and inheritances tomorrow.
The timing of retirement income withdrawals will impact your bottom line and your lifestyle. You must plan in advance for government rules concerning your tax-deferred accounts. Step 3 provides a projection of future income along with a strategy for making it last. Your spending plan will be based on modern applications of tried and true investment vehicles. With expert guidance to leverage and protect your assets, your income can remain secure throughout your lifetime. (A bonus is that it often creates a legacy so you can secure the future of others.)
Contrary to common perceptions, tax-deferred accounts may not be the best place to accumulate all of your savings and wealth. Research indicates that thirty years of deferred taxes are usually repaid during the first five years of retirement. Meanwhile, Uncle Sam controls the “tax calculation” applied to your income. How would you feel if you learned your overall tax bill was five to ten times greater than what you had saved? This step outlines smart solutions to preserve your assets for your own use and gives you the tools to make objective decisions about your investments.
I invite you to schedule an appointment for a complimentary online assessment with me for 30 minutes. We’ll go over your goals for retirement and how we may be able to help. You are welcome to watch my video explaining the process before you call to give you a good idea of what our call will cover.

This week there were two new additions to Sammy Seeds Fun Zone at Seedlings Garden Centre….....mother and daughter Alpacas!!! The Garden Centre which is owned and operated by three generations of the Taylor family has recently increased its animal family, with the arrival of chipmunks, rare breed pigs, Rheas and a range of exotic birds.
The two alpacas are currently settling in to their new homes within the petting farm at Seedlings. Sammy Seed's Fun Zone opens at Easter after significant investment by the Taylors. The only problem for the two is that they haven't been named yet so Seedlings owner Faye Taylor hopes that the local population will help out and come up with some inspired names. Faye said "We are going to run a competition via our Facebook Page to hopefully come up with a couple of names for the Alpacas - we are looking to involve the local community on this as hopefully our fun zone within the garden centre will become a popular place for many of the local children to visit and learn about the animals"
Alpacas are from the camelid species and originate from South America. They are closely related to the Lama but are much better tempered and so are great for children to visit and get to know. There will also be the opportunity for the children to feed many of the animals as part of the Fun Zone experience.
Seedlings is getting ready for its seasonal re-launch and also has a cafe and produce shop with the Garden Centre.

Surely we are all reeling from a post-Coachella hangover and don’t have much musical energy left to give, right? Nope, wrong. We gathered ourselves long enough to compile our favorite tracks from April.
This month we delve deep into South America with tracks from Peruvian band TOURISTA. As well as new releases from Colombia’s Ondatrópica and Mexico’s, Natalia Lafourcade. And we also didn’t forget about LA’s own Las Cafeteras and Ozomatli, whose new material is definitely worth a listen.
The Internal Revenue Service is offering some relief for victims of Hurricane Sandy: Those who need to take a loan or “hardship distribution” from a retirement plan can do so without the red tape they might otherwise encounter—and with less damage than usual to their overall savings strategy.
Under the relief plan the IRS announced on Friday, “qualified employer plans,” including 401(k), 403(b) and 457 retirement plans, can make loans or hardship distributions to account-holders without first assembling the documentation they might normally require. Instead, the IRS is letting borrowers and plans cobble the paperwork together after the fact.
Tapping a nest egg for a hardship distribution isn’t a move to be taken lightly. Such withdrawals are generally taxable and a 10% penalty applies when the account owner is age 59 ½ or younger. For taxpayers who want to avoid that hit, the loan may be the better deal. The borrower is still making a dent in his or her savings, but provided that loan is repaid within five years, the proceeds are tax-free. After taking a hardship distribution, 401(k) and 403(b) participants are normally barred from making new contributions for six months. But for Sandy victims, the IRS is suspending the contribution ban.
The agency is also letting some plans that don’t normally allow hardship distributions make an exception for Sandy victims. In addition, while IRS rules typically restrict hardship distributions to a short list of major costs including unreimbursed medical expenses and the purchase of a home, Sandy victims can use the funds for a broader array of purposes, including buying food and paying for shelter while waiting for repairs.
A hardship distribution must be made by Feb. 1, 2013. To qualify for an expedited loan or hardship distribution, a person must live in a federally-declared disaster area or be using the money to help a child, parent, grandparent or other dependent who lives or works in the disaster area.

The recent Paris attack incited a broad rise in Islamophobia in the UK. Muslims from all across the country are being targeted on the street, on public transport, at work, and at educational institutes. Tell-MAMA – a national body to monitor anti-Muslim hate crime reported a 300% rise in Islamophobic incidents since the horrific attacks in Paris on November 14, 2015.
The reported anti-Muslim hate attacks range from general abuse and threats to extreme violence with victims having age range from 3 year old child to over 60. Majority of the perpetrators are middle aged white males. The anger and hate against the Muslims seem to be increasing every passing day. The most worrying element is that the prime victims of these attacks are Muslim women who are visible because of their veil and modest Islamic clothing which make them visible at the street-level. A vast majority of the cases against Muslim women are taking place on public transport, where either fellow passengers or the bus drivers abuse them. There is a common pattern of the kind of comments made against them and most of the perpetrators hold them responsible for the Paris attacks. In some cases, mothers were verbally abused and threatened in front of their children. In one of the most recent cases, the perpetrator pointed finger at the 5 month old baby of a mother in East London and said “Are you going to brainwash her to bomb people”. In another case, a Muslim female student was threatened to death on a bus by an elderly male near Liverpool.
Such attacks are not just restricted to South Asian or Arab women but the White British converts to Islam are also experiencing the same hatred targeted towards them because of their faith. Right after the Paris attack, a white female convert was approached by a white male in South London who verbally abused her because of her hijab and abaya.
Even the school children are not spared of this targeted hate campaign against the Muslim communities in the UK. There is a steady rise in attacks against the Muslim children at schools and in some extreme cases, the perpetrators were their own teachers who abused their Muslim faith and called them terrorists. Some very violent attacks have also been reported from the universities with the most recent case at the University of Edinburgh where two Muslim students (one of them was wearing a hijab) were spat at, physically and verbally abused and called ‘terrorists’.
Many attacks against the mosques and Islamic institutions have been reported as well. Recently, two mosques in Newport, South East wales, were vandalised with anti-Islamic graffiti in the aftermath of the Paris attacks.
Such appalling rise of Islamophobic hate crime in Britain is not a new phenomenon. There has been a consistent trend of anti-Muslim backlash after every terrorist attack locally or internationally. Tell MAMA project recorded a 275% ‘weekly increase’ of anti-Muslim hate crime after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in Paris in January this year. Similarly, there was reported to be a 286% quarterly increase in such attacks after the murder of a British soldier, Drummer Lee Rigby, in May 2013.
There is no denial of the fact that all those who carried out terrorist attacks in Paris claimed themselves to be Muslims but more important is that Majority of the Muslims all around the world condemn violence in every shape and form. Similarly, the overwhelming British Muslims always came forward and disassociated themselves with all those individuals and groups who perpetrate violence in the name of Islam. However, their efforts could barely protect them from organised hate campaigns running against them in full swing.
Islamophobia in Britain has a long history with its roots going back to pre-7/7 and 9/11 eras when a British think tank, the Runnymede Trust, popularised this term in one of their research reports in 1997. Unfortunate incidents like Paris attack act as a catalyst to anti-Muslim campaigns flourishing in the British society. Some key actors to promote Islamophobia in Britain are far right nationalist groups like Britain First and English Defence League who are proactively demonising Muslim communities in Britain by holding them responsible for all the ills of the British society.
Media is another crucial element to escalate islamophobia in the UK. Certain sections of the print and electronic media have been promoting anti-Muslim sentiments in Britain for a long time. In 2008, Cardiff School of Journalism, Media and Cultural Studies produced a research report entitled ’Images of Islam in the UK’ which suggested that two third of newspaper stories say British Muslims are ‘Threat’ or a ‘Problem’. By continuously and deliberately mentioning the religion of criminals, they played a central role in arousing public’s sentiments against the Muslim communities in Britain.
The intensification of Islamophobia in the UK has deep impacts on wider Muslim communities in Britain. Their sense of vulnerability and collective victimisation as a faith community has increased over the years because of unfair Government policies and irresponsible media coverage.
The horrific attacks against innocent people in Paris were as shocking for Muslims as they were for the rest of the world. However, as much as Muslims are the greatest victims of terrorist ideology, they are held responsible and made a ‘suspect community’ by certain segments of society because of their faith. This environment is unhealthy and dangerous especially for the younger generations of Muslims who are born and bred in Britain and consider this country as their home. It’s not just the Muslim communities but British society at large must come forward and challenge the hate narratives against the Muslims. The Government needs a policy shift and must introduce more ‘inclusive’ policies instead of focusing on ‘preventive’ measures – which have been miserably failed to tackle the challenges of extremism in Britain.

Metro Manila -- my current home -- is a metropolis of extraordinary contrast. Referred to as the National Capital Region, it is the workhorse of the country, housing about 12.8% of the total population and producing about 38% of national GDP. Metro Manila is a key contributor to the country’s dynamic and vibrant economy, which has been among the fastest growing in East Asia in recent years. With glittering high rise buildings, a Starbucks on seemingly every corner, and bustling commerce wherever you look, one could be lulled into thinking that the citizens of Metro Manila all have a comfortable life.
But this is far from the reality. When we first moved to Manila last year, my youngest daughter was startled to see during our tour of her new school, a huge shanty settlement – houses upon houses – just outside the school wall. For a young teenager, she’s well-traveled and has lived in big, rapidly urbanizing cities in China and Turkey, but never had she seen such a contrasting patchwork of people’s circumstances, right there outside her school gate.
Of the almost 15 million people who live in Metro Manila, about 3 million live in informal settlements. They live in houses made of tin, plywood, and plastic sheeting, many built under bridges or on stilts over creeks and rivers. These settlements are scattered around the city – wherever a small piece of land is available – and many people who live in these areas have lived there for several generations. In the last several decades, millions of Filipinos have flocked to Manila from their hometowns in the countryside or on the islands, in search of jobs and better education and opportunities for their children. Many of these settlements are in disaster-prone areas along Manila’s many waterways that rapidly flood during monsoonal rains.
Climate change is making this situation worse. The Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. Each year more than 20 typhoons enter the Philippines, and the damage is often extensive. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda) – one of the most powerful typhoons ever to have made land fall – devastated the eastern part of the Philippines. Even Metro Manila is not immune – in 2009, Typhoon Ketsana (Ondoy) made a direct hit on Metro Manila, causing more than 464 deaths and huge damage and disruption to the city.
Between June and November, it often rains in Manila. My family is lucky – where I live when it starts to rain the water rapidly rises above our ankles in the streets, but it just as quickly subsides again, as a well-functioning drainage system kicks into operation. But for the vast majority of the city, this is not the case. Just two weeks ago when a tropical storm passed directly over Metro Manila, many of our staff could not make it to the office because roads (and, in some cases, their houses) were flooded.
Recently I had the opportunity to visit some areas to be included in the Metro Manila Flood Management Project – a huge undertaking by the Government of the Philippines with support from the World Bank and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) – that will improve the city’s drainage infrastructure, clean up solid waste, and help to protect the lives and livelihoods of 1.7 million people, including many of the city’s poorest citizens who live in precarious circumstances along some of the city’s most flood-prone waterways.
Visiting the informal settler communities living along Manila’s waterways is a sobering experience. Trash fills the waterways, and the smell is pervasive. Small children play along the river beds just inches from the water with no fences to stop them from falling in. Houses are built on every postage stamp piece of land – under the bridges, along the sidewalks, and just above the water line in the rivers. Even on a dry day, the water is flowing fast and it is not hard to imagine how terrifying it must be when the water roars along those rivers during a storm.
When a disaster strikes, it is always the poor who suffer the most. And yet in many areas, the poor are also helping themselves. We visited a creek where programs run by the government and civil society are helping the community improve their own safety through participation in river cleanup activities, by educating them on how to better manage their trash, and by helping them plant and tend gardens along the riverbanks to keep the banks clear of informal development and improve their living environment. Even the construction of a simple fence between their houses and the creek can go a long way to making sure that children are protected and parents do not need to worry for their safety.
There’s still a long way to go but I am really pleased that the government is taking this important step in Metro Manila and that the World Bank and AIIB have the privilege of supporting them along this journey.

The TU-Automotive Europe 2018 conference that took place in Munich on the 30 October 2018 was an excellent opportunity for AUTOPILOT to raise awareness on the importance of user acceptance in the development new technologies.
The FIA Programmes Director, Olivier Lenz, participated at the event presenting the preliminary results of the user acceptance evaluation work that AUTOPILOT is being carrying out. FIA is one of the 45 project partners which oversees the user acceptance component of the project.
In its endeavour to develop an interoperable, standardised, secure, and open-access IoT platform enabling safer automated driving, the AUTOPILOT project is collecting feedback from the users of the developed services. The core of the user acceptance evaluation will be data collected from individual users via questionnaires, tailored to each pilot site and use case. In addition, focus groups will allow for in-depth discussion of the use cases and questionnaires for professional drivers will provide a more technical perspective on the test runs.
Overall, the vast majority of the respondents evaluated the service described in the survey as a positive experience, which was exciting, safe and easy to use. Moreover, the evaluation shows that most of the users would be willing to use car sharing over renting a car or using a tourist bus in the city, paying, though, special attention to security and privacy of their data in the utilisation of IoT automated driving services.
Olivier Lenz insisted on the importance of getting a fair level-playing field for the providers of connected services to develop innovative concepts based on a fair access to relevant data and to provide a maximum of added value to mobile consumers, to ensure a supportive economic framework as indispensable condition for a successful development of connected mobility.
During the conference, some innovative start-ups in the connected car, mobility, autonomous vehicles space took the stage for a pitch off, with a panel of expert judges scoring them on their pitching skills, product viability and innovation. Keynote presentations and panels featuring BMW, Ṥkoda, and Renault who shared insights on current product developments, projects and partnerships.
This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No 731993.

This book seeks to comprehensively analyze and document U.S. foreign policy toward a strategic Cold War ally that posed a stark challenge to the traditionally-stated U.S. preference for democracy and political freedom. It details the complex ways in which the U.S. reacted to that challenge and went about crafting policies of longer-term accommodation with a regime it wished to retain as a close ally in a strategically important part of the world.
The Sages asked, "Who is mighty?" and answered, "Those who can control their own emotions and make of an enemy a friend."
The War in the West: A New History: Volume 2: The Allies Fight Back 1941-43 [Audiobook] by James Holland
Penguin presents the unabridged, downloadable audiobook edition of The Battle of the Atlantic, written and read by Jonathan Dimbleby.
Berkeley, CA, September 21, 2007: Kevin E. Consey, who has led the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAM/PFA) since the autumn of 1999, announced his retirement today, effective January 2, 2008.
"I have been privileged to work with a talented and energetic staff of the highest professional caliber during my tenure. The significant and substantial accomplishments produced during this time were due to our collaborative efforts and their intelligence, skill, and perseverance," Consey said.
He continued, "The continuing demanding work and challenges of the new building project and capital campaign need increased energy over the next several years. Eight years of service and significant accomplishments in the areas of institutional growth and preparatory fundraising, program development, architect selection, and conceptual design work for a new building mark a good time to step down and retire."
UC Berkeley appointed Consey in 1999, in part because of his more than twenty years of leadership experience directing art museums, especially those in growth and building phases. Consey was asked to assist the campus with developing a strategy to ameliorate the seismic limitations of the museum's current building on Bancroft Way. Part of his key early work was to organize and manage a temporary seismic retrofit of the existing structure. This was completed in 2001, and has enabled the institution to meet the applicable state seismic safety codes and remain open and active during the planning process for a new facility.
During his tenure, Consey led the process to develop a program, select a site, and initiate a fund-raising campaign for a new building for the museum and film archive in downtown Berkeley. In September 2006, a committee comprising UC Berkeley staff, faculty, students, and donors selected the Tokyo-based architectural firm of Toyo Ito and Associates to design the new facility from a field of over 140 competitors. The initial phase of conceptual design has been completed, and is now beginning the campus approval process.
The period of 2000 through 2007 was one of dramatic programmatic, collection, and economic growth for BAM/PFA. According to Consey, the institution's annual operating activity grew over 100 percent over eight years, from $4,837,000 to $9,680,000, due to robust increases in private philanthropy, and despite a permanent $500,000-per-year cut in campus funding due to state budget shortfalls.
In that same period, the market value of BAM/PFA's endowment increased from $15,528,000 in 1999 to $60,776,000 in 2007, with an additional $7.5 million in funds functioning as endowment—an increase of over 390 percent. In a similar fashion, the market value of BAM/PFA acquisition funds grew from $216,900 to $3,011,000, a more than tenfold increase.
Staff recruited and hired to carry out the mission of BAM/PFA increased from 72 FTE (full time equivalent) to 102 during this period.
During Consey's tenure, BAM/PFA has pursued an acquisition program as active and ambitious as that of any museum in the U.S. Since 1999, more than 2,000 works of art and over 4,000 films and videos have been added to the collection, ensuring the institution's continuing excellence among American university museums.
Acquisition highlights include fifty major historical Chinese paintings from the renowned James Cahill family collection, the Bernard-Murray Collection of Tibetan Art, and the Peil Collection of late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century photographs. In addition, there have been numerous gifts and purchases of work by artists who have been featured in BAM/PFA's groundbreaking exhibitions program, including Joe Brainard, William Wiley, Peter Doig, Richard Misrach, Joan Jonas, Shirin Neshat, Rigo, Fred Wilson, Jay DeFeo, Bruce Nauman, and Eija-Llisa Ahtila. In 2005 BAM/PFA established the Edith R. Kramer Film Collection in honor of her remarkable tenure as Senior Curator at the Pacific Film Archive.
The exhibition program has been equally active, with major exhibitions and publications produced, such as Joe Brainard: A Retrospective (2000); The Dream of the Audience: Theresa Hak Kyung Cha (2001); Richard Misrach: Berkeley Work (2002); Everything Matters: Paul Kos, A Retrospective (2003); Drawn by the Brush: Oil Sketches by Peter Paul Rubens (2005); Measure of Time (2006-07); Ant Farm: 1968-1975 (2006); and A Rose Has No Teeth: Bruce Nauman in the 1960s (2007). A vibrant public lecture program and symposium series evolved and expanded along with the exhibition program.
BAM/PFA's MATRIX Program for Contemporary Art, one of the longest-running exhibition series of its kind, has continued to thrive, with more than fifty new projects over the last eight years, with a particular emphasis on international artists from countries including Australia, Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Israel, Japan, Poland, South Africa, and Venezuela.
The Pacific Film Archive continued its level of high achievement as one of the leading film archives in the country, presenting numerous major film retrospectives including the work of directors Michelangelo Antonioni, John Cassavetes, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Alfred Hitchcock, Abbas Kiarostami, Krzysztof Kieslowski, Akira Kurosawa, Ang Lee, Guy Maddin, Louis Malle, Mikio Naruse, Yoko Ono, Yasujiro Ozu, Sam Peckinpah, Gus Van Sant, and Luchino Visconti. In addition, PFA has presented and supported an extremely wide variety of film festivals and special programs including the San Francisco International Film Festival and the San Francisco International Asian American Film Festival.
BAM/PFA's role in supporting and enhancing the educational mission of the campus has remained central to its mission. During his tenure, Consey led a range of initiatives to increase student attendance and participation in the museum and film archive. These include establishing a full-time academic liaison, who works with faculty members to integrate BAM/PFA programs, collections, and exhibitions in the core-teaching curriculum on campus. In 2002, an Academic Advisory Committee was formed, comprising UC Berkeley faculty members in diverse fields who advised the director and museum staff on academic issues of importance to the faculty, and communicated to faculty research and future projects of BAM/PFA staff. The BAM/PFA Student Committee was also revitalized over this period. The cumulative result of these initiatives was a substantial increase in student attendance at both the art museum and film archive to as much as 24 percent of the total audience.
Consey will continue to reside in Berkeley, where he will work on independent projects and resume his arts management consulting practice that he established in 1996 and suspended during his tenure at Berkeley.
The UC Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (BAM/PFA) aims to inspire the imagination and ignite critical dialogue through contemporary and historical art and film, engaging audiences from the campus, Bay Area community, and beyond. BAM/PFA is one of the largest university art museums in the United States in both size and attendance, presenting fifteen art exhibitions and more than four hundred film programs each year. The museum's collection of more than 15,000 works includes exceptional examples of mid-twentieth-century painting, including important works by Hans Hofmann, Jackson Pollock, Eva Hesse, and Mark Rothko, as well as historical and contemporary Asian art, early American painting, Conceptual and contemporary international art, and California and Bay Area art. The PFA film and video collection now includes the largest group of Japanese films outside of Japan, as well as impressive holdings of Soviet silents, West Coast avant-garde cinema, seminal video art, rare animation, Central Asian productions, Eastern European cinema, and international classics.
The University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive is supported by the National Endowment for the Arts and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. Additional support is provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Koret Foundation, the Bernard Osher Foundation, Packard Humanities Institute, the Henry Luce Foundation, the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts, the Columbia Foundation, the Christensen Fund, the William H. Donner Foundation, San Francisco Foundation, Gap Inc., other private foundations and corporations, and our individual donors and members. Major endowment support has been provided by the Phyllis C. Wattis Foundation and by George Gund III.
General admission is $8; admission for seniors, disabled persons, non–UC Berkeley students, and young adults (13 – 17) is $5; admission for BAM/PFA members, UC Berkeley students, staff and faculty, and children under 12 is free; admission for group tours is $3 per person (to arrange a group tour, call [510] 642-5188). Admission is free on the first Thursday of each month.
General admission is $9.50; admission for seniors, disabled persons, UC Berkeley staff and faculty, non-UC Berkeley students, and youth (17 and under) is $6.50; admission for BAM/PFA members and UC Berkeley students is $5.50. Additional features are $4 for all patrons.
Daily 11 a.m. – 5 p.m. at the museum's Bancroft lobby admissions desk, and one hour before the first showtime of the day at the PFA Theater box office.

I’ve done lots of shoots with Brianna over the years (this one being the most recent). Some have been family-style sessions and some have been more conceptual. Either way, Brianna has always been up for anything and has plenty of ideas of her own–and she’s ridiculously photogenic. I felt so nostalgic doing her senior session only a block away from the place where I did her first session over 8 years ago. It was the first day I had met her. Since that day, I’ve had so many wonderful memories with her and of course with her mom, Tina, who is also in some of the pictures below. I have so much love for them both and am lucky to know them.
Brianna, I’ll try to spare you all of the things adults always like to say about how you’ve grown up so fast and how I just can’t believe it and how wonderful you’ve turned out. But it’s true just the same. You’re awesome. You’re a great friend to people and you have great friends in return (as seen below!). You’re kind and fun and beautiful (and an excellent dancer).

This 2-CD set collects the soundtracks from two of Daiei Studios ghost films, "100 Monsters" (aka "100 Ghost Stories", 1968) and "Along With Ghosts" (aka "Journey Along Tokaido Road", 1969). I don't know too much about these films - they were apparently released in the U.S. but are rarely seen today.
"100 Monsters" takes place in 18th century Japan and involves a storyteller whose ghost stories come to life, punishing a greedy landowner for opening a brothel in an old religious shrine. The film was successful, with imaginative special effects, and quickly spawned two sequels. "Along With Ghosts" is the second of these, a tale about a little girl who travels along a haunted road in search of her long-lost father (an earlier sequel, "Ghosts on Parade", is not featured on this set).
The music for both of these movies is suitably eerie and mysterious, but there are also extensive portions of Japanese dialogue inserted between nearly every musical cue, and I found this to be distracting. Still, both scores feature an interesting variety of music, and may appeal to horror buffs as well as collectors of Japanese fantasy soundtracks.
This is a literal translation from YOKAI HYAKU MONOGATARI. A 'yokai' is a ghost or spirit in non-human form, like an object such as the Umbrella Ghost and Lantern Ghost featured in the movie, or a bestial or demonic creature. A spirit in human form is referred to as a 'yurei', such as the ghost of Oiwa in the YOTSUYA KAIDAN dramas.
(Rokurokubi, literally 'Potter's Wheel Neck', is the long-necked spirit. Perhaps the name suggests the extending neck of a vase as it's thrown)
(The Tsuchikorobi or 'Earth Roller' is the giant shaggy cyclops in the woods, which is said to travel about in the form of a great ball of soil)
[I think the first kanji on this CD track listing is wrong (it reads 'Momotaro', but not the same kanji as the legendary Peach Boy's name). All my other Japanese sources use the kanji for 'Yasutaro'.]

This will depend on the amount of your fluid intake, the amount of residual urine to be drained and the effect of any medication you may be taking. Some people may only need to catheterize once daily, while others may catheterize up to six times a day. Your clinician will advise on a schedule that will suit you.
Depending on your doctor’s advice and your health, you should drink about 6-8 cups of fluid every day.
Just relax for a few minutes and try again. You may be anxious causing your sphincter muscle to tighten. Coughing may help. If you still have difficulty, contact your clinician for further advice.
Sometimes there may be specks of blood on the catheter or slight bleeding after removal. Don’t worry, as this will usually clear up in a couple of days. If the bleeding persists, you should contact your clinician for advice or go to the emergency room at your local hospital.
This can happen if you are tense. When you are tense your muscles can go into spasm and prevent the catheter from coming out. Eventually these muscles will relax and allow you to remove the catheter, so rest for a few moments then try again. Coughing several times as you begin to remove the catheter will also help. If these suggestions don’t work, you should contact your clinician or go to the emergency room at your local hospital for help.
Ask your clinician for a letter stating that you are carrying the catheters to manage a medical problem.
There are many different types of catheters and your clinician will show you a selection from those that are suitable for you. Together you will be able to choose one that suits you best.
It may feel like a strange sensation at first, but ISC should not be painful. For some the urethra is more sensitive when first learning, but ask your doctor for advice if this does not settle with time.
This will depend on the underlying reasons for catheterization. Sometimes ISC is a temporary measure until your bladder and urinary sphincter regain normal function. You should report any changes in drainage volume or pattern of passing urine to your clinician who will review the clinical need for continuing ISC, or altering the frequency.
You should catheterize as soon as you remember. Then continue as normal at the regular intervals you have been advised. Remember that you must completely empty your bladder to remove any residual urine and reduce the risk of infection.
If you miss catheterizations once or twice don’t worry, but if this happens often it can cause various adverse events such as a urinary tract infection or urinary leakage. If the pressure in your bladder becomes too high there is a risk that your urine may back up to your kidneys, which can cause serious injury

Thanks to the nice comment of Jane Eileen on my previous post I decided to finish another experiment I did with Schway/Aroz! She wrote: "This goes so nicely with the name of your blog!" I guess she is right, although it was not on purpose.

More about sculpture than jewellery, Neshka is a collection of pieces in ebony, sterling silver and genuine semi-precious gems.
Neshka was founded by Agnieszka (Neshka) Krusche, graphic designer and art director. Agnieszka is passionate about art history and contemporary art & design. Working in Canada and Poland, she has been involved in design projects and exhibitions across North America, Poland, Italy and France.
The collections are described as Objets d'art, Wearable Art, Sculpture to Wear, and Architectural Jewellery.
Summer brings with it light and airy makeup, with shadow that’s barely there so that you don’t have to worry about it creasing and melting.
Paul and Joe’s Summer 2017 Daydream Believer collection delivers with lip tints, gel-based cheek tints, and a gorgeous eyeshadow palette in a honeycomb design. The collection is unique enough that you almost want to collect it, but the formulas work so well that it’s better just to use them.
The Tinted Lip Glosses are the kind that magically turn pink upon application to your lips. There’s a clear version and one with subtle silver sparkle in it, but they both turn into a pretty bright but wearable pink as they stay on your lips.
The eyeshadow colours can be mixed together or worn separately. There are three shade collections: mauve, blues and beiges, and golds and browns. They are all super shimmery and blend beautifully.
My favourite products are the cheek tints which are water based and feel like gel. They blend well and leave a natural shimmer-free. Again, there are three shades: peach, pink, and neutral rose. The peach is pictured here and is the lightest of the bunch, so probably suited to fair skin.
As always, the collection delivers when it comes to cute yet functional makeup. Pick it up at Shoppers Drug Mart Beauty Boutique locations.
Oh wow I haven’t tried their lipsticks yet, this is going on my wishlist! I’ve only tried their pressed powder with the WB case from b-glowing but have been dying to try more Paul & Joe makeup!

Recently placental perfusion imaging using velocity-selective arterial spin labeling (VSASL) was applied in pregnancies complicated by fetal heart disease. Here we demonstrate the feasibility of performing VSASL in the human placenta and provide supporting evidence that is needed for validation of placental VSASL. In our results, placental VSASL generated significantly higher ASL signal than pseudocontinuous ASL, showed high reproducibility, and demonstrated inflow-dependence. This study lays the groundwork for future investigation of placental perfusion imaging in pregnancies complicated by placental insufficiency.

SUMMARY: AU. This is the sequel to Walking the Line. Kim and Shego look to renew their unorthodox relationship.
I’m under my mistress’ skin, but I don’t think she knows it. I’m there and I could make her itch. I don’t know whether she doesn’t know or just doesn’t accept my reasons for being here and her reasons for keeping me. We’re both happy with what’s happening, right? She’s happy to have me and I’m happy to be here…right? I’m not wrong, right?
Shego had hardly been home for ten seconds before her house phone started ringing. She sighed in annoyance and went to answer it without even bothering to check the caller ID; she knew already since the house phone was ringing that someone she did not want to speak with was calling. She answered in her usual clipped tone.
“Whatever you’re about to say makes me unhappy,” the officer retorted. A phone call from her mother was the equivalent of the devil dialing her up. The older woman never said something that she wanted to hear.
Her mother laughed. “Well, just go pet your girl when we’re done and I’m sure you’ll feel much better.”
Shego was going to do that anyway, but there was no need for her mother to know that, especially when the blasted woman was mocking her. “What do you want, Mommy?” she practically demanded to know.
“You’re really not going to like it,” Isabel commented in a light tone, as if she was having fun irking her favorite child.
“Mommy, we just got together and didn’t kill each other last year. Why are you pressing your luck?” the green-skinned woman inquired.
“How do you know about that?” Shego demanded to know with anger in her voice. She probably had that little cabin in the mountains bugged, the daughter thought with a growl. She knew that she should have checked that stupid place out.
“I know, give you some credit. How long have you known?” Shego asked with a sigh. It was like she had no privacy thanks to her mother.
“Don’t you have stupider kids to spy on?” the officer huffed. Surely it would behoove her mother to check on those idiot sons of hers than spending time poking her nose into Shego’s business.
“I keep tabs on all of you. Come on, we’re all going to get together and meet your man,” Isabel said.
“I suppose. We could just call it a family reunion and I could cook a huge meal. It’ll just be for the weekend,” Isabel explained.
Isabel knew better than trying to get her children together for any longer than a weekend; the last time that she had tried to have them together longer had ended with several injuries and wounds. One of them was even in tears by the end of the whole mess. The worst part of it was that they were grown at the time, except for the twins.
Having Drakken meet her family seemed like such a big step to the green-skinned woman. It was like she was accepting everything that he had offered her and she did not want him to think that she accepted. Not to mention him and her brothers at the same time, her mother might as well just stab her in the eye with a million needles; it would be much more merciful in her opinion.
“Her too?” Shego was going to have to draw the line somewhere it would seem because it looked liked her mother was going out of her mind. She would have asked if her mother was going senile already if she was not so certain that her mother would drop whatever she was doing, leave wherever she was, come to Shego’s house, and kick the green-skinned woman across the face with all of her might.
“I think it’s obvious that he wouldn’t know that she’s my pet. I mean, I don’t think anybody would handle that well. I mean, I’m keeping a girl as a pet. He thinks that she’s my cousin,” Shego explained.
“Well then, I’ll just have to tell those blockheads that she’s their cousin,” her mother commented in a bored tone.
“And I’m supposed to trust them?” Shego asked incredulously. She would not trust her nutty brothers to walk down the stairs on their own and she was supposed to trust them to not blurt out that the redhead was her pet? Yeah, right. She was tempted to ask her mother what she was smoking to even think that she would trust her brothers.
“Either way, I had you and you messed up. It’s not my fault you slipped, so you shouldn’t take it out on me.”
“Wouldn’t she feel left out?” Isabel asked. She could just see Kim pouting like an abandoned puppy if her mistress went some place for the weekend and left her behind.
The older woman chose not to answer that rather evident question; if her daughter did not care, she would not even have the pet that she had, she reasoned. “Do what you will with her. She is your pet, after all. So, this weekend, all right?” she inquired.
Isabel disconnected the call without bidding her daughter farewell, not that Shego cared. The green-skinned woman returned the phone to the base and then she looked around. She noted her girl’s absence and she wondered where the shrimp might be. She chose not to think too much about it at first because her pet did do the save the world thing every now and then and she typically could not call to let her master know that she was all right.
Since Kim had her missions and things, Shego did not bother worrying. Well, at first she was not very concerned. When time started ticking away, she started to get a little worked up.
After being home for a couple of hours and her pet had not come in yet, Shego was not sure what to think; her brat usually made it home by a certain hour. She could not go out and look for her munchkin, even though she would have liked to do so, because Kim could seriously be anywhere, not just on the planet, but possibly in space. No matter how much she tried to tell herself that her pet could take care of herself, being a hero and all, that did not help comfort her.
No matter what, Shego always remembered how she and her pet met; she knew that she would never forget that day. She always recalled Kim being knocked out in that cardboard box, both of her arms heavily bruised and her right hand almost useless. She had been out in the cold where anything could have happened to her and she would have been very close to powerless. To Shego, her pet would always be someone to be worried for.
The raven-haired woman’s fretting was ended by the sound of the front door opening. She stalked out the entrance hall to watch her girl come in. Kim was drenched and sniffling. She got caught in the rain, more than once actually. Shego just stared at the redhead for a moment.
“What happened to you?” the older woman inquired in a gruff tone, contradicting the fact that she had just been distressing out her mind almost over her pet. She hated that the girl made her worry and it got on her nerves.
“Everything, but mostly rain. Do you know it’s raining in New York too?” Kim asked while sniffling some more. Saving the world was a serious business sometime and it was a full day job that day.
“You’re going to shampoo my head?” Kim asked with a grin. Had she known she was going to come home and get her head washed by her master, she would have fought harder to get home sooner.
The redhead continued to smile; her mistress had wonderful hands and when she shampooed Kim’s head, the girl completely relaxed. She trotted off toward the bathroom while peeling off her soaking wet clothing. Shego joined Kim in the bathroom a few minutes later and the girl was already in the tub. The elder woman gathered the things for her monster’s hair and began to wash her pet’s head. They were silent for a while; all seemed right in the universe.
The raven-haired female thought about how she would not be able to do such things anymore if she married Drakken and moved away. She would miss grooming Kim, taking care of Kim. But, she could not do such things forever, right? Things changed and life went on.
It had never occurred to either of them that someone might think that there something was sexual between them for what they were doing at the moment. Shego had never thought to peek at her pet’s nude body and even if she did catch glimpses, she did not think anything of it. Kim had never thought to show anything off either. It was something that they did not think about; it was normal to them. They supposed it was normal to them because of that first night that they spent together.
“Where do you see yourself in five years?” Shego asked her little monster. It seemed as if she was coming out of left field with the question to her soaking pet.
“With you hopefully,” Kim answered as if that was obvious and it was to her. It was logical to her to want to be with the person that was dear to her. She wanted to be with her mistress forever if it was feasible. Other than that, everything else was irrelevant.
“And you’re just content to be my pet?” the pale woman inquired in a perplexed tone as if she just could not understand it and she could not. Why did a genius hero want to be her pet? How could she be happy like that? She was just a pet; it was not like that was a good thing.
“Wasn’t it?” the girl riposted. She was content as long as Shego was the same way and she would stick around for as long as her master wanted her around. She liked being with the pale woman. She did not see what was so difficult to comprehend about that.
“If that’s what it means to stay with you,” she replied sincerely. It was not being a pet that bothered her. It was being replaced or cast aside that bothered her.
“Why?” the green-hued female asked in a confused tone. Why did Kim stay with her, put up with her, play the pet for her? It just did not make any sense to her. Her monster could have anything she wanted, yet she stayed to be a pet for a cranky woman.
“Oh, well, that’s really simple. You’re nice to me, you care about me, and you don’t try to force me to do things that I don’t want to do. Around you, I feel free,” the redhead explained. There was more to it, of course, but she could not say it all to her owner. After all, Shego seemed just a bit on edge for the simple fact that her pet liked being with her.
Kim was surprised by the simple phrase that her mistress used. No profane words or harsh terminology. It was just one word that everyone over the age of two knew and used. And she had said it so deliberately, but it did not hurt Kim. It seemed to hurt her master, who was slightly hugging her around the neck now. It sounded like it pained Shego to say those words.
Kim turned around to face her seemingly distressed master. The pale woman appeared to be fighting back tears. The redhead tried to comprehend why Shego would say such things and why she would look the way that she did. Did Shego think she was stupid because she stayed with a woman who refused to acknowledge her beyond being a pet? Maybe that was it.
The slender adventurer did not think that it was so stupid to want to be with someone that she deeply cared for. She did not think that it was stupid to desire to be with someone that she wanted to be happy and she truly did want Shego to be happy. It had started out that she had planned to stay with Shego until the woman could stand on her own and be happy on her own, but now, there was more to it. She wanted to stay with Shego to experience the pale woman’s happiness with her. She just wanted to be with the super-powered female.
“If this is stupid, then so be it,” Kim replied. It was that simple to her. She could be what she was as long as she remained where she was. She just needed to stay, for both herself and her owner. She hugged Shego around the waist, not caring that she was naked and wet. “So be it,” she repeated in a whisper.
Kim was up in the loft and she was lying in her bed. She gathered that her mistress did not understand her, but she had known that for a very long time. She did not want understanding at the moment. She knew that deep down her master comprehended that she required Kim’s presence to some degree, which was always the important thing to Kim.
She knew that Shego would not grasp her being a pet too much because Shego was not a person that was willing to surrender power to someone else. The emerald-eyed officer had to always be in charge. It was something that Kim could understand and respect; she liked being in control of the situation as well. It was just that with her owner, she had learned to unwind and allow someone to take care of her. In learning that lesson, she had come to care a great deal about Shego and she wanted to be someone important to the woman, which she was.
Being special was another important thing in being a pet as far as Kim was concerned. She knew that she was special to Shego and, in her mind, that was enough. It sort of filled the void of unrequited love to be special to be her owner. After all, how many other people could say that they were special to the green-skinned woman? And because of that, she could continue to be a pet, despite some of the thoughts that she had been having recently. She just did not want to lose her place.
Shego sat up in bed, alone that night because Kim was busy thinking and it did not occur to her to go hop in her favorite resting place. Shego was thinking too. She was thinking hard.
If Drakken met her family, it would make everything seem so finalized, she believed. He would believe that she accepted his marriage proposal, which she had not, even though she had never said so out loud. He had not offered aloud. He had just given her that stupid ring on St. Valentine’s Day and thought that meant that they were getting married. Her father and brothers might think the same thing.
The pale woman was certain that her father and at least Hego would try to encourage Drakken, even if they did not like him. She doubted that they would like him because he was so unmanly. They typically shunned Mego for not being big and strong, so she bet that they would do the same with Drakken, but they would work passed that because he had a y-chromosome and was with her. Her father and older brother would like that undoubtedly; anything that led them to believe that she was straight would be all right by them.
Her mind echoed those words back to her, led them to believe that she was straight. It sounded as if she doubted herself. She was straight. She was only attracted to men; not counting the few mental slips that she had in regards to her little monster. She was straight and, more importantly, she was not attracted to her mischievous imp of a pet. Certainly not, she told herself.
The super-powered female decided to go to sleep before her mind started coming up with other stretchy phrases and she would have to defend herself to herself. She was straight and she was not attracted to her pet in any way, shape, or form. That was it.
Shego came into the apartment as usual. She flopped down on the sofa and looked around, realizing that something was off. She did not see Kim anywhere and then suddenly the redhead popped up behind her, as if she had come out of thin air. The apartment owner made an irked noise in the back of her throat as her pet leaned against her back.
“Oh, you feel tense,” Kim commented with a purr for no reason that Shego could guess as she pressed herself against her mistress’ back and felt all of her master’s tight muscles.
“It’s nothing,” the pale woman huffed. She was tempted to swat her annoying rascal away, but she left the girl alone. Besides, she would not mind an excuse to have another massage.
“You’re just looking for an excuse to get me to take my shirt off again,” the older female remarked.
The olive-eyed girl went to work immediately on the raven-haired woman’s tight shoulders. Shego eventually relaxed as Kim kneaded the muscles in her back. The redhead leaned in near her mistress’ ear.
“Would he do this to you?” Kim asked in a low voice. The question covered so much ground and Shego knew that instantly. She did not have the answer or she did have the answer, but she just did not say it.
The slim adventurer nipped at Shego’s earlobe, catching her by more surprise than that question had. Before the elder female could think of a response or bark an order, one of Kim’s hands snaked around to the front of Shego’s torso. She gently caressed the pale woman’s left breast, through her shirt, making the older woman moan deeply. The petite hero had very skilled hands, her master noted.
“Can he make you feel this way?” the redhead inquired while moving her mouth to Shego’s ear to her neck, suckling on the flesh, tasting it, loving it. “I could if you let me,” Kim whispered while making her mistress moan again, more licentiously than before…
Shego shot up in bed and gasped. She was covered in a thin layer of sweat. She realized that she had been dreaming. Of course, it was a dream, she told herself. After all, her runt would never do such things to her and she would never allow it if the shrimp did try. In fact, she would slaughter her little brat if she ever tried to do such things to her. But, why had she dreamed that?
She looked around thinking that her pest might have gotten in bed with her at some point and cuddled up next to her to induce such a revolting dream; the redhead did have a history of fondling her while they slept. But, there was no sign her elf. She was alone just as she had been when she went to sleep. Besides, Kim snuggled up to her all of the time and never made her dream anything like that; well, almost never anyway. So, why had she dreamed it now?
The emerald-eyed woman decided not to let it worry her. It was just one freakish brain impulse. It would probably never happen again or at least if it did, it would happen long after she had forgotten that last ghastly vision. Yeah, it was just one freak accident and that was the end of it, she convinced herself.
Shego was lying on her bed in her pajamas. The room had a strange illumination to it, as if there were candles lighting the area, but there none around from what she could see. She scanned the room, wondering what was going on and then she spotted a pair of olive green eyes stalking her at the foot of the bed. She craned an ebony eyebrow; what was her brat up to now?
Kim slowly rose to where a feral smirk was visible on her face. She pulled herself up onto the bed with all the grace of a big cat, revealing that she was in a blush pink camisole and matching shorts, which were cut high on her slim thighs. She crawled up the length of the bed and up Shego’s body. She continued to smirk when they were face to face; she was straddling her master’s stomach.
“What are you doing?” Shego demanded to know. She knew that sometimes her pet was naughty, but she was pushing her limits now.
“Oh, but you don’t really want that. I mean, if you did, you’d just throw me off. That’s only what your mouth is saying. There are better things to do with your mouth. Let me show you some.”
The emerald-eyed female was set to protest when Kim leaned down and kissed the corner of her mouth; a move that the pale woman often did to her little pet. She then placed soft, wet kisses on Shego’s chin; her mistress did not put up any sort of fight. She made her way down to the pale woman’s neck and lavished the whole area with tender, but hungry kisses. She paused when her lips landed on the elder woman’s pulse. She nuzzled the space for a second or so and then licked at the artery barely hidden underneath that pale, sea green skin.
The raven-haired woman bit her lip to keep from moaning from the attention, but that only seemed to encourage the adventurous little redhead. Kim moved on with her exploration, farther down the length of her mistress’ body, methodically unbuttoning the officer’s pajama shirt while keeping her mouth on all of that lovely, delicious pale skin. For some reason that was beyond Shego, she was not wearing a bra underneath her pajama shirt and Kim seemed to know that.
One of Kim’s hands went for the soft flesh while the other supported her over the apartment owner and her mouth retreated to the light spring green skin at the collar bone. Shego did not moan, but she did arch into the younger woman’s luscious touch. Kim noticed and pulled her mouth away from its feast of Shego’s body for a brief moment.
The redhead smirked, appearing something close to hunting feline that spotted its prey. She flung her master’s pajama shirt to the side as if it was the worst thing that she had ever seen and then stared at the treasure that she uncovered with her act for a few seconds. Shego was ready to cover herself up because she had been stared at before when she was topless and it was never for a good reason, despite her sexiness. Apparently, fellows were turned off by green nipples; she thought that was the reason behind why the petite hero was eyeing her.
“So beautiful,” Kim whispered before diving right in to do exactly what she wanted to do, attaching her mouth to the jade gem revealed to her, causing Shego to cry out in sheer ecstasy……
Shego shot up from bed, chest heaving because she was breathing like she had just been saved from drowning. Her hair was sticking to her forehead from sweating so hard. Her heart was racing. She had had one of those dreams again; it was the third one that week and it was only Tuesday.
The emerald-eyed woman wondered what brought on that dream. She glanced to the side and saw her pet was lying there, practically draped on her. She gasped and acted without thinking, literally kicking Kim out of the bed. Kim yelped when she hit the floor.
The slender pet pouted and exited the room as she was ordered to do. She could not believe that she had just gotten kicked out of bed. She knew it was against the rules for her to sleep in her owner’s bed, but she could not recall the last time that the rule was actually enforced; hey, on some nights, she woke up for brief moments and found her owner holding her, embracing her. So, she thought that it was all right for her to sleep in the bed now, even if Shego had never said so.
She had not even done anything to be kicked out of bed, Kim thought. Well, not counting the fact that she had been resting her head on Shego’s chest, but she did that half of the time that she slept next to her master. So, why had she been kicked out of the bed?
Shego shot up from her pillow yet again. She was drenched and, apparently, it was not just sweat that time around. She was breathing as if she had just run a marathon. It felt like there was lava coursing through her veins instead of blood. She had had one of those dreams again; the worst one yet.
The dream had been so intense that the pale woman had hit an apex in her sleep, which was what woke her up; yeah, it felt that good. That was certainly a new experience, she silently noted. She had never in her life had a dream that made her feel like she needed a cigarette and not for her usual reasons. Thanks to that dream, she felt like she needed a cigarette for the normal reasons.
To make matters worse, she was sleeping next to Drakken; she had no excuses to offer up as to why she had had the dream. She was glad that she had not cried out when she had reached the overwhelming peak in the dream or she might have woken him up and she had no idea how she would have started to explain why she had made the noise. She doubted that he would have understood anyway. She hardly understood how a dream could be so good.
She needed to stop having those dreams; especially since she needed to be well rested since she would need all of her energy to deal with her family tomorrow. Besides, Kim was just her pet and she should not be thinking of the girl in that manner. After all, she was straight, the raven-haired woman told herself. She was straight.
Next time: Shego’s family meets Drakken. Guess how many of them like him; go ahead and guess. And then try to guess what happens. And then bring me a sandwich, please.

Here is a recipe extraordinaire!! (I must give credit to my pal Laura for this one). It was served for the first time at my annual CHRISTMAS IS FOR CHICKS, CHOCOLATE & CHAMPAGNE PARTY this past December.
Toss all ingredients into a crystal bowl and use your hands to really mix everything up so the apple and chocolate bits are totally covered in cool whip. Lick your fingers to sample the results.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Open can of cresent roll and unroll the dough. Place one triangular piece of cresent roll on a baking sheet or cooking stone.
Put a cocktail weenie in the wide end of the dough triangle; roll the dough around the sausage (you should have one layer of dough covering it completely - leaving the 'toe' end exposed). Taper the other end to look realistic at the base of the toe. Use a knife to score 'knuckles' on the dough in the center.
Place the toes in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown. After baking, add a dab of ketchup at the exposed end of the toe and press an almond slice onto the ketcup for the nail.
Melt the chocolate bark for 90 seconds (or longer to melt throughout). Dip each sandwich cracker into the melted chocolate half way and lay on to wax paper to cool.
When the chocolate has hardened, melt the vanilla bark and dip the opposite side, laying the cookies back on the wax paper to cool.
Cut squash in half from stem to bottom. Deseed. Place squash cut side down on pan and bake at 350 for 35 minutes or until outer edge is soft to the touch. Let cool. Use fork to scrape squash from shell.
Saute regular garlic in 1/4 stick margarine. Add cream and cheese. Add salt and pepper to taste. In another pan, saute roasted garlic, and remaining butter. Add spaghetti squash to this mixture of roasted garlic. Saute in pan and occasionally mix squash to cook more evenly. Then add cream and cheese mixture to roasted garlic and squash. Add more salt & pepper if needed. Serve.
Note: You can add fresh diced tomatoes and parsley for garnish and color. Toss this in at the end prior to seving.

Comment results for Contest #2: Quickfire I on Ryan's coverage of Jennifer Garant's painting "Bad Habits in Venice" are in.
The nun clutching the Bible has a red stain on her dress!! She must have been involved somehow... who would ever suspect her with that innocent get up on, holding the Word of God?! How low does a person have to go to cover up a murder? Someone order a DNA test on that stain, STAT.
We all know that SOMETHING crashed in the desert outside of Roswell, New Mexico that hot afternoon in July 1947. It is quite possible that the extraterrestrial life forms got so fed up with the publicity and alien mockery that their little visit caused that they decided to pick up ship and camp elsewhere. I am banking they choose ‘The City of Light’ to call home. Coincidence that this painting took place in the very same city? And, now we have a murder investigation on our hands. I don’t think so. I have heard that aliens, unlike humans, don’t have to depend on air for survival. And, what better place to lurk and spy on unsuspecting prey than in the Venetian canals themselves. What’s that?! I see one of them now!! Camouflaged on the side of the orange building near the skyline!! Wow, who knew they were capable of changing color in an effort to conceal themselves from their victims. They obviously haven’t mastered their technique, however. I can still see the outline of his green head and limbs. Oh, the horror… Oh, the humanity!! Run for your lives folks… RUN, RUN, RUN!!!!Thanks to all who participated in this round!
The person with the most interesting conspiracy theory or funniest comment in the comment section of Ryan's coverage of Jennifer Garant's painting "Bad Habits in Venice" has a chance to win some points during this challenge. See article links below.
You may not post 2 in a row; you must allow at least five others to post before you can post again. Remember, this is not a contest of who can rack up the most comments... it's the content that counts!
Thanks to everyone who had a chance to participate. The pictures were absolutely priceless!! Everyone did a great job!!
Second Place - Maggie Murphy: Third Place - Robyn Service: The remaining contestants in order of placement:
Challenge Name - "The Royal Tenenbaums" This is one of our favorite movies. If you have not seen it, you should, but that is totally optional! It is a family full of wonderful dysfunctional people.
Contest Participants: We want you to find a character in that movie and do a make-over to look like that character. If you can include more than just yourself to do this, that would be great, but they would have to be a diferent character than you. After you are dressed as one of the characters, you must get a photo in a public place posing as them (i.e., in a restaurant, at a park, etc.) If you have more than two of your family and/or friends do this with you, you will receive an extra point by each judge.
You will be judged on a number of factors including funniest, most true to character, most unusual location for the shot, etc. You will be awarded a score between 1 and 10 if you participate. This is a great chance to increase your point standings.
If you missed this part of Contest #2, there will be plenty more legs to make up the points, some even worth 20 points! So, everyone is still in contention to win a Jennifer Garant original.
Arrange a plate of food to look like something artistic: a face, a Van Gough, an abstract, your dog, etc. Take a picture of the plate and send to info@jennifergarant.com.
4) The person with the most points at the end of the contest will win an original painting by Jennifer.

After the frightening ordeal with baby Gates, this sweet story was balm for my soul. My friend Wendy (baby Gates’ aunt) introduced me to this sweet couple and asked me to photograph their adoption. It was such a sweet blessing to witness the joy of the placement and see the story of adoption unfold. This is baby Seth, the new son of Sara & Mike.
I asked Wendy/ Sara’s BFF to write this blog post since she has been there as a best friend to Sara since childhood! She wrote this about her friends, Mike and Sara, and their journey:
“Mike and Sara have longed to be parents and after 8 years of infertility and a failed adoption, the beginning of 2013 brought a new path for Sara and Mike. They had finally and peacefully resigned themselves to the fact that it was okay that they were not to have their own children. Death looks like that…peace. There was no bitterness, no anger, just peace.
“Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.” John 12:24
After disillusionment from looking at various adoption agencies, a couple of years ago I introduced Sara and Mike to Covenant Care (CC) with the statement, “This is not like other adoption agencies…trust me just talk to them.” So they did and they agreed. Essentially Christians were enabling other Christians to adopt. They had not found anything like CC in Kentucky. Sara grew up in Georgia and her parents and brothers still live in Georgia. Due to her strong ties still in Georgia, CC was willing to take them as prospective adoptive parents.
The hard thing about being a prospective adoptive parent is that you have NO idea if anyone is looking at you. Well, just a few weeks after Sara and Mike were both at peace with their decision that they would not be parents, their sweet case worker named Kayla called to tell them that a birthmother wanted to meet Sara and Mike in the next couple of weeks and wanted them to have her child. WHAT? Are you kidding me? This had to be a joke? This could not be happening to them? Surely, the birthmother would change her mind. Well, 4 days after Mike and Sara met the precious birthmother and grandmother, little Seth was born and she had not changed her mind! Then, Seth went to the sweetest foster family for the 10 day waiting period, then Thursday, April 25th, Sara and Mike’s family was expanded.
Mike is a pastor in Kentucky and his wife Sara is a special education middle school teacher, they have about 10 dogs (jk) and chickens and now they are parents to a precious little boy, Seth Michael. I think you can see the joy and love that is overflowing from this couple and waiting to be lavished on this precious child who was anointed by God at just the right time for them.”

I also find it funny how you were silent around here for the first 3 weeks as loss after loss piled on.
137 points this week. 2nd straight week of most points And Brees was only mediocre (to his standards). Take that Pawno!

Meanwhile, I am offering Josh Gordon or Alshon Jeffery. Both sitting on my bench most weeks, given I have Megatron, Fitzgerald and Cruz.
Looking to upgrade QB. Will trade Stafford and either Gordon or Jeffery for an elite QB. Send me a trade if interested.
2 years ago. I almost beat AussieBeans in the final. This year I know i'll beat him (or whatever punk Jesus serves me up)
Chatter has been quiet on this thread. I assume most people have accepted that my team is by far the most dominant, and there is no way I am not winning this league. Beast was my latest victim, no surprises there.
Our driver yelled, “Pushsay,Pushsay, push for your lives!” My friend of many years, Sam Speerstra, was managing this project. Sam is an “Indiana Jones” character from way back. Go with Sam, and you are sure to fine some adventure. He was the one who got me into diving for diamonds in Venezuela during the rainy season a few years ago. What a nightmare that was! Sam also introduced me to Madagascar, which is where this adventure took place. We were prospecting for high-grade gold.
“Hurry, give it everything you’ve got. I hear trucks coming!” Sam was driving us in an old Toyota pickup truck that probably already had a couple of hundred thousand miles on it. It was a wreck! The engine kept cutting out as we were working our way up the steep grade of a remote mountain, somewhere in darkest, undeveloped Madagascar. Sam’s swearing got progressively more descriptive and deafening as the engine problems got worse. We were pretty close to the top when the engine finally quit. It was in the middle of the night on a blind corner of a pretty busy highway. Most of the trucks traveling the highway did not have headlights; they travel by moonlight a lot in Madagascar!
They speak French in this particular country. My French is lousy, but I understood the message. As soon as the engine quit, three other guys and I were out of the truck and pushing uphill. We already knew there was not a single pull-off behind us for several miles. We had been watching for pull-offs! There were also no guard rails. The embankment was very steep. Visibility was non-existent; the moon was not out this night. We were in near total darkness. We could hear the trucks coming from both directions on the highway. Sam was steering the vehicle as we pushed, yelling “Pushsay, Pushsay!”
We barely got the Toyota off the side of the road just up from the blind turn, when big delivery trucks passed by from both directions. The one coming downhill only had one dim headlight. It was moving in low gear. It probably didn’t have any brakes.
Once off the road, Sam stepped out of the vehicle, slipped, fell down the hill and ended up face down in a muddy ditch. The cussing started all over again. No one could find a flashlight to fix the engine. The guys figured it was a problem with the fuel injectors being too loose. They tightened them up in the dark, by feel.
Sam decided the best thing to do was push-start the Toyota backwards downhill, around the blind curve in the darkness. What else could we do? We pushed, he steered. We tried three times. The engine would not start. That was when Sam admitted that the Toyota never push-started in reverse! We ended up in the same place on the blind curve where the Toyota originally conked out. “Pushsay, Pushsay for your lives.” Back up the hill we pushed the Toyota once again. I started looking for a place to sleep. There was only one sleeping bag in the truck, so I started quietly planning how I was going to find it first—while the others discussed the problem in French.
Pretty soon, a big delivery truck coming up the hill was stopped by one of the Frenchmen involved with our operation. I did not understand everything that was being said, but it became clear that no one had a working flashlight and no one had anything to tow with. The truck did have a long piece of wood in the back. It looked to be about 20 feet long. It was a rough-cut 2X6. They decided to use it as a push rod from bumper to bumper. Sam was going to attempt a jump-start going forward up the hill.
My biggest concern was getting over the top of the mountain. From there it was downhill to the village where we would put up until morning in a hotel—with real beds. We also had not eaten dinner yet. The main concern of Sam and everyone else was not destroying the license plate on the Toyota. What’s the big deal about a license plate for a broken down old vehicle? Without the license plate being nearly perfect, there were serious problems with “Les Polisia” at the many security checkpoints throughout the country! Damaged license plates were cause for harassment. Destroyed or missing license plates were cause for seizure! The severity of the offense would rule how much money it would cost to buy ourselves out of trouble at each checkpoint.
I was mainly hoping to get over the hill and down to the village where we could find a place to sleep that was off the open ground.
Pretty soon, the push rod was placed between the vehicles. Not being able to stand back any longer with dinner and a real bed predominant in my mind, I over-rode everyone’s objections by placing the push rod on top of the Toyota bumper, under the license plate, through the hole and up against the spare tire. This way, they only had to hold and balance the push rod against the front bumper of the big truck. Sam gave the signal and off they went—uphill. I watched. It looked like the Keystone Cops in the dark. Five big guys (two were passengers from the big truck) holding the push rod against the big truck’s bumper, running along in front of the big truck as they went faster and faster. Sam popped the clutch in second gear and the Toyota roared away in front of the truck, in the dark with five men being dragged behind, holding onto the push rod. They had to let go, because Sam took off like a shot, not wanting to take any chance of the truck quitting again.
When the men let go of the push rod, it dropped to the ground, pushed up against the license plate, and pop, off went the license plate, sailing into the darkness, over the steep embankment. The men were so upset, I thought they were going to cry. No use in crying over tomorrow’s problems. I urged everyone back into the truck so we could get going before it quit again.
Shortly thereafter, we found ourselves checked in to a reasonably comfortable hotel, by fourth-world standards, and eating dinner—and sharing a warm beer. The next day we found the license plate. It was only slightly damaged. Yes, life is good!

The eye can be examined with relative ease regarding both its function and its structure. A practical examination consists of the ability to relocate the orbit and the response of the student to light and lodging.
The function of the eye may be tested in numerous methods. The client might be asked to identify illuminated letter or objects of varying sizes on exactly what is understood as the Snellen chart.
On the other hand, the examination of the structural part of the eye may be made in a number of methods. Tension within the eyeball is measured by a "tonometer." In particular diseases, particularly in glaucoma, the stress in the eyeball is increased significantly.
It needs to be well kept in mind that a client with an eye problem may have other problems. Typically other physical conditions are main and affect the eye as a repercussion. The appearance of the eye can inform the patient and the doctor to difficulties in some disturbances of other parts of the body even prior to other symptoms present themselves.
One's reliance on sight is stressed when one deals with a short-lived or possible permanent loss of this important sense. Thus, when corrective steps are sought, specific forms of vision correction such as contact lenses or eyeglasses are recommended.
On the other hand, some individuals are bothered with that they have actually some framed lenses or contact lenses in front of their eyes.
For this factor, advanced surgical operations were established to encourage reduced usage of contact lenses or glasses. One of which is the now popular LASIK eye surgery.
Basically, LASIK eye surgical treatment is the brief term for "Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis." Like its tangible counterpart, LASIK eye surgical treatment is another kind of vision correction. The only distinction is that with this type of surgery, one's vision is remedied permanently.
With LASIK eye surgical treatment, the refractive errors in the cornea are completely transformed. This can be done using an "excimer laser."
The primary purpose of this surgical treatment is to produce a threadlike, rounded "flap" in the cornea using a blade called "microkeratome." In a series of unfolding and laser processing, the cornea is finally reformed, permitting better the eye to direct more light into the retina.
Amidst the growing appeal of LASIK eye surgery, there are still disadvantages that individuals must understand. Probably, the main reason that this kind of eye surgical treatment has actually become well accepted is due to the fact that many of its cases had actually succeeded.
Because LASIK eye surgical treatment involves the operation of the retina, which is one of the most delicate portions of the eye, many individuals say that the operation can be extremely risky.
To puts it simply, a basic error could nearly trigger an individual's lifetime blindness. It is crucial more helpful hints to think about many factors prior to choosing whether LASIK eye surgical treatment is the ideal restorative step one has to go through.
LASIK eye surgical treatment may fix your vision but it does not necessarily imply that it can give you a twenty-twenty. Even if statistical reports show that 70% of the clients may have 20/20 vision, this does not necessarily imply they have ideal vision also.
Offered all these things, it can be deduced that, in spite of the appeal of the operation, LASIK may not always be Our site the perfect eye surgery the method most individuals view it
Conversely, the assessment of the structural part of the eye may be made in several methods. It should be well kept in mind that a patient with an eye issue might have other issues. Frequently other physical conditions are main and affect the eye as a repercussion. The look of the eye can signal the client and the doctor to difficulties in some disturbances of other parts of the body even before other signs provide themselves.

No organization can best serve the people it represents in the modern world unless it reforms itself to cope with new global challenges. The Commonwealth – a voluntary association of 54 countries from every continent of the world and now 62 years old – decided to do just that.
When the Heads of Government last met in November 2009, they did so at a time when the world was in the midst of an economic and financial crisis; the old order of economic power was changing; climate change showed signs of endangering global economic activity and the safety and livelihood of millions of people, and posed threats to the very existence of a number of countries. Terrorism, too, threatened the security of states and presented a serious challenge to international peace.
Significantly, Heads of Government decided that, in such a world, it was important to build a stronger, more resilient and progressive Commonwealth and make it relevant to its times and people in the future.
They recognised that an organisation, in which every race and every religion is represented and which comprises rich and poor countries, large states and small islands, has the inherent capacity to contribute significantly to solving the world’s problems. The sheer diversity of the association would be almost impossible to create today, for there would be no compelling reasons to form it and there would be many pressures to resist its formation. The existence of the Commonwealth is, therefore, a gift – one that should be nurtured and enhanced.
The heads of government made it clear that they wanted the Commonwealth to continue to be an important player in the world drawing on its rich diversity to help build global consensus around the Commonwealth’s values of peace, democracy, the rule of law, human rights, gender equality and economic development.
Therefore, they decided to establish an Eminent Persons Group (EPG) to propose ways in which the Commonwealth could continue to be both influential and a leader in dealing not only with the problems faced by its own members, but in helping to resolve the issues confronting mankind as a whole.
This was a timely decision by Heads of Government because, prior to the 2009 meeting in Trinidad, the sentiment had grown in the Commonwealth media, civil society organisations and among some member governments that the association was in danger of becoming irrelevant. Many doubted its capability of continuing to be a significant organisation amongst its own member states, let alone an influence in the global community.
Of particular concern was that, even though the Commonwealth claims to be a “values-based” organisation, through a number of declarations, there have been violations of human, political and civil rights in several Commonwealth countries, and the association has not spoken out strongly enough against them. Indeed, while the Commonwealth is the only multilateral organisation with machinery to oversee compliance with its declared values, that machinery – the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) – has responded only when there has been an unconstitutional overthrow of governments; it has not acted against early signs of serious or persistent violations of the Commonwealth code. This has led to scepticism about the organisation and the claim that it is hypocritical.
In the past, the Commonwealth broke unchartered ground in dramatic ways to lead the world into ending gross violations of the rights of people. When the current EPG submits its report to Commonwealth Heads of Government for their consideration in Australia in November, it will be 25 years since the first EPG submitted its findings on the evils of apartheid in South Africa. That 1986 report of the first EPG was a momentous – now historic - document. It called the Commonwealth’s and the world’s attention to the imperative of urgent action to end apartheid, and documented in an irresistible manner the consequences of the global community’s failure to act.
Remarkably, given the defiance of the apartheid regime, that first EPG thought it had failed. But, indeed, their work had started the process of success. Less than four years later, Nelson Mandela was released from 27 years of captivity and the walls of apartheid came tumbling down.
The present EPG has a different task from the first one, but it is no less daunting. Essentially, it is to propose ways in which the Commonwealth will remain relevant to its times and people in the future. To do so, the Commonwealth will have to reform in many ways, and it will require political will by its leaders to act on the bold proposals that the EPG is putting forward.
The proposals cover a range of issues, among which are: enhanced machinery for ensuring that states comply with the Commonwealth’s declared values and that their peoples human, civil and political rights are respected; a stronger role in development issues to bring about change in the international arrangements to give developing countries a voice so that they are not simply flotsam and jetsam pushed around by the tides of larger countries’ interests; practical measures to help small and vulnerable states meet the severe challenges they face particularly access to financing for education, health and infrastructure; creating means to increase investment among Commonwealth countries, and increase trade between them; dealing with the effects of climate change and establishing rapid response machinery to aid countries quickly when natural disasters strike; confronting the problem of HIV/AIDS including by more enlightened leadership and repeal of laws that victimise sufferers; more opportunities for youth who comprise more than 60 per cent of the Commonwealth’s population.
The Commonwealth Secretariat itself also needs a new commitment from its member governments. Over the years, its staff complement has been reduced while demands on them have increased. The number of its entire staff is now less than the cafeteria staff at the UN in New York.
But, the Commonwealth remains an association that could bring immense benefit to the people of its member countries and to the world. Its very diversity, and the opportunities it presents for meaningful discourse across ethnic, religious and national lines, are simply priceless in today’s much troubled world. If the EPG proposals find favour with governments, the Commonwealth will matter to its own 2.4 billion people, and, again, be an example to the world.

“Robert Venditti’s run on X-O MANOWAR is one of the finest in Valiant’s storied history,” said Valiant Editor-in-Chief Warren Simons. “From his very first issue with artist Cary Nord through PLANET DEATH, UNITY, ARMOR HUNTERS and beyond, Rob’s work on X-O MANOWAR helped cement Valiant as one of the leading publishers in comics today and his contributions to the fabric of the Valiant Universe will continue to resonate for decades to come. But he won’t be leaving X-O MANOWAR quietly. What we have in store for X-O MANOWAR’s grand finale as we head toward issue #50 might just be Valiant’s most audacious turn to date. As Valiant prepares to celebrate X-O Manowar’s 25th anniversary in 2017, ‘LONG THE LIVE THE KING’ will be a colossal turning point for the character…and foreshadow even bigger changes yet to come in the future.”
X-O Manowar #47 is the beginning of the end to Venditti’s historic run on the book. It begins the final arc “Long Live the King.” The arc will detail a striking cosmic showdown between X-O Manowar, Aric of Dacia and heir to the throne of the Visigoth Empire, and The Torment. The Torment are a foe far more terrible than any that have come before. They have traveled for eons to reach Earth and Aric and his X-O Manowar armor. Will Aric be able to challenge a seemingly omnipotent threat with motives beyond the comprehension of moral men? Will the armor truly be Earth’s salvation, as the Vine’s myth foretold? Is this the beginning of the end for X-O Manowar, or the beginning of something even bigger?
“X-O MANOWAR isn’t just the story of Aric of Dacia’s odyssey across time and space. It’s also the story of Valiant’s reemergence as the premier storytelling company in comics today, and Robert Venditti has been an integral member of the creative vanguard behind that success since day one,” said Valiant CEO & Chief Creative Officer Dinesh Shamdasani. “Over the course of 56 issues, we’ve cemented X-O MANOWAR to his rightful place in the pantheon of comics’ greatest heroes and X-O MANOWAR #50 is the ultimate celebration of that achievement. To officiate it, we’ve set out to invest an unrivaled amount of energy and attention into X-O MANOWAR’s final four issues and to formally recognize this as the culmination of one of the greatest, most nuanced character arcs in the history of modern comics. Now, as we march toward issue #50, we’re preparing even greater surprises for X-O MANOWAR’s future – including the anniversary cover to end all anniversary covers. X-O MANOWAR #50 will be a milestone accomplishment in every sense of the term.”
The covers for X-O Manowar #47 come from Kano, Phil Jimenez, Khoi Pham, Clayton Henry, Rafa Sandoval, David Lafuente, and Jeff Lemire. X-O Manowar #47 hits comic book shelves on June 29, 2016.

“I never thought I’d put on the cape and tights. That was never my intention. I was just going to give Nightwing the push he needed to be Robin again.”
Tim Drake has been through the ringer. The third Robin has been very prevalent throughout the DC Universe in the last few years. From his time on Future’s End to a leading position on the New 52 Teen Titans. However, Detective Comics is where Tim Drake shines. James Tynion IV and Eddy Barrows have been making magic for quite a few issues now. Together, this creative team has turned Tim Drake from a creative vortex to one of the most compelling plotlines in DC Comics history.
The Young “Detective” has been trapped within Mr. Oz’s prison for some time now. Now that Batman knows Tim is alive, it’s only a matter of time before the two are reunited. But with the incredible scripts Tynion has been writing it may be at the hands of Drake himself.
In Detective Comics #965, Tim Drake begins his daring escape from imprisonment. Employing his famous intellect, he cracks Oz’s systems and grants himself a small bit of freedom. His ingenuity and resourcefulness are wonderful reminders of how compelling Tim can be. His strength is his mind, his ability to out-think the unthinkable.
Tynion has had plenty of time to develop a relationship with Tim, and it shows. In his Detective Comics run an emphasis is placed on the entirety of Bruce Wayne’s extended family. In his hands, Tim is quickly coming to the forefront of the Bat-Family.
Eddy Barrows and Eber Ferreira have been an incredible creative team for DC. Their not-so-recent work on Martian Manhunter is some of the most captivating panels in recent memory. It’s no wonder why they’ve remained on Detective Comics with Tynion for a while now. Barrows has a classic style that can create a surprising amount of contrast to make the story even more interesting.
There’s a blend of flashback sequences mixed in with the story. The art team do an eye-catching job of juxtaposing the old and the new, giving a more dramatic touch to the modern day. It’s a small touch but one that makes their work so remarkable.
James Tynion IV, Eddy Barrows, Eber Ferreira, and Adriano Lucas make it look easy. Together, the team have been creating amazing stories featuring all of the characters in Gotham’s ranks. Tim Drake, Red Robin, has been taken to particular heights. After sacrificing himself for his team, he found himself at the mercy of one Mr. Oz. Now that he’s gained back some freedom, Drake is off on an exciting adventure by some amazing creatives.
Unlike the New 52, Rebirth has a plethora of creative teams that are still intact, and with good reason. Some of the best stories in comic history have been put together thanks to DC’s latest relaunch. Detective Comics is being helmed by one such team. One so good it could drive any reader to stand and declare, “Oh Captains, My Captains.”

The Bad Things, After the Inferno (Silent City Records), Seattle. The whole world knows the bands that word conjures. But they only tell one small fragment of the city’s musical story. Hidden by the noise of electric guitars and the sweet scents of gentrification, a strong, vital underground scene still flourishes. A junkyard cabaret inhabited by the underdogs and freaks, caught in the sudden glare of burlesques and little jewel box clubs. A place filled with the joyous outcasts, of celebration and commiseration. 06/18/14 >> go there
Zebrina, Hamidbar Medaber (Tzadik), Canadian jazz pianist Jonathan Feldman had an epiphany. Raised on a steady diet of Miles Davis and his former bandmates’ records like Chick Corea’s “Light as a Feather”, Feldman hadn’t really explored the music of his family’s Jewish faith. Growing up Jewish in Hamilton, ON and attending a Jewish elementary school and summer camp exposed him to some Israeli folk music and the liturgical music of the synagogue, but aside from the avant-garde offerings of clarinetist Ben Goldberg, he never checked out much klezmer music, sometimes called “Jewish Jazz”. 06/16/14 >> go there

Cascada de Flores, Radio Flor (Ita Music), It’s the sound and feel of XEW, a powerful station out of Mexico that broadcast far beyond Mexico’s borders. It broke down national boundaries, and for many listeners in the early-20th century, the voices of XEW became members of the family, the music the soundtrack to daily life. It’s a warm summer evening. The windows are open, and the radio is on. As the family gathers and chats, the radio orchestra fills the living room with psaltery and violins. Piano and poetry segues into jingles and wildly romantic boleros. Finally, the deep booming voice announcing “Chucho el Roto” drifts in from the receiver. The family huddles around the radio to catch every moment of the eagerly anticipated radio drama. 05/12/14 >> go there

Benyoro, Self-titled, Benyoro: the band is, quite literally, a meeting place. Its name, taken from Mali’s Bamana language, means precisely that.

How to cook Seafood Wrap Recipe? This recipe is prepared with Mediterranean Salsa. This dish will transport you to the Mediterranean. Large tomatoes have seeds that you may want to remove before chopping, so I use grape or cherry tomatoes instead, to avoid seeding. Though mango isn’t Mediterranean, it complements the other salsa ingredients nicely and provides just the right touch of sweetness to balance the acidity in the tomatoes and olives.. Here are ingredients and easy directions:
Make the fish: Earlier in the day or the night before, sprinkle fillets with salt and pepper and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the oil and lemon juice. Press thyme onto top of each fillet. Wrap each fillet in 2 overlapping slices of prosciutto and place seam side down on a plate. Wrap plate with aluminum foil and refrigerate. Proceed to next step.
Place a rack in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F. In a heavy-duty ovenproof skillet, heat the remaining tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add prosciutto-wrapped fillets, seam side down, and cook until prosciutto is browned, about 1 minute. Gently turn and cook remaining side until browned.
Cover skillet with lid and roast in oven to desired degree of doneness about 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish or until the crumbs are golden and the fish is just barely opaque when cut in the thickest part or flakes easily with a fork.
While the fish is roasting, make the salsa: In a small bowl, combine all salsa ingredients and toss gently until well blended. Hold at room temperature.
Remove pan from oven, using hot mitts on handle and lid, and let stand 5 minutes. Serve immediately with 1/4 of the salsa on each fillet.

Yes I know I am way behind on the web page but things have not been too exciting. Here is a catch up from the end of school to pre-vacation.
I’m busy. I’ve got a book to finish, and the smell of the end in my nostrils. So I’m not going to write politics. But yeah: we have to stop voting hyenas into positions of power. It’s a really dumb thing to do.
So I put that Arabic phrase into Google, and it took me to a whole lot of sites about monkeys sexually attacking women. Hey, there’s porn of it! “Crazy monkey attack hot women!” “Two girls, one monkey!” And so on and suchlike.
Which led me to wondering how the guy (we’ll assume it’s a guy, shall we?) who typed that got directed to my blog.
I’ve never posted anything that catered for his taste. I’m not into humans having sex with animals. Not just “not interested”; I hate disapproving of things, but I disapprove of people fucking animals, or setting things up so the animal has to fuck a human.
If I was arguing the case against bestiality I’d say it’s wrong because it’s non-consensual, since animals can’t consent. (Ah-hah! Someone could say: you reckon animals consent to be killed and eaten?)
Then I’d say it tends to be cruel. (And someone could work out some arrangement in which the animal was neither hurt nor frightened, and the human was consenting.)
And then I’d fall back on the yuck factor. Bestiality squicks me. That’s no basis for making law and policy (plenty of people are still squicked by sex between men), so I don’t have a very strong case. Still, I can do what I like, and not do what I don’t like, on my own blog.
Anyway, I guess he found one of my posts about bonobos, which would have included the words “monkeys”, at least as in “bonobos are not monkeys”, “sex” and “woman”. And I hope he also found complete satisfaction.
The main thing I know about encouraging a woman to want to fuck me is to talk to women I fancy and think are interesting, so that I’m enjoying myself whatever happens. That way, though I hope she’ll want to take me to her bed, or flop into mine, I can be relaxed about it. I try to be funny and clever, and let her talk what I probably think is most of the time. (Which means that she probably does about half the talking.)
At some stage there’s a pause, and a moment, and then we look at each other, and we might decide that it’d be a good idea to kiss. Or else not. But if the pause ends in kisses or a held hand or a held thigh, then more physical stuff is likely to happen, after which we take it outside. And then we take it home, hers or mine.
Of course, it’s fine that the PUA approach doesn’t suit me. My approach is my approach because it’s what works reasonably well for me. I’m better at talking than anything else, so I stick with what I’m best at.
I’ve seen guys impress and attract women on the dance floor, where it’s damn near impossible to say a word. So I know that that works. It just doesn’t work for me. People don’t actually see me dance and run away in horror, but that’s all you can say. No-one has ever seen me dance, and, as a consequence, wanted to fuck me.
PUA guru Mystery. He’s wearing a ski hat with sunnies, which is his idea of “peacocking”. I thought it was pilot headgear at first, which was more interesting. I’ve got an old-fashioned pilot’s hat and goggles thing that I sometimes wear to parties, so I do peacock. Wouldn’t wear the Biggles gear to a bar, though. Not in the mountains, hey?
Take the “neg” thing, where the PUA says something to the woman that sounds like a compliment, but also undercuts her. Like, oh, “Like your hair colour. Are the roots meant to be showing?” Or, “That’s a great dress. And brave of you to wear it.” Or some such.
The idea is that attractive women get compliments all the time, and handle them complacently, reading them as, “please pay attention to me, you goddess.” So they ignore those approaches.
A neg is supposed to be more interesting than a straight compliment, and because it includes an element of put-down, it’s supposed to make the woman feel that she needs to work for the respect of the man who negged her.
So it’s manipulative, and that’s creepy. It also seems pointlessly unkind. Why would you say something calculated to make the person you’re with feel slightly worse? Especially if you actually fancy that woman?
Even a single night in bed is a relationship. It seems odd to want to start any sort of relationship based on putting the other person down.
If you use negs, and other “techniques”, you turn yourself into a method and not a person. I might get sex from a method but I wouldn’t get the affirmation and, oh fuck it, the ego boost I get when someone meets me and decides she wants to fuck my lights out.
Worse, it’s a sign of contempt. You could only bring yourself to neg someone if you think they’re dumb enough not to notice, and unassertive enough to feel a little worse about themselves rather than realising that you’re a toxic fool who should be avoided.
I’m not a biologist or animal psychologist, but I’m interested in n how ethics works across species. Also, in some parts of Africa and Asia, when you get out of your vehicle it can be handy to know about the likely behaviour of pack or herd animals that can kill you.
I’m snob enough not to want to have much to with people who write ignorant bollocks about how animal heirarchies work. Mostly they’ve only read some dated stuff about wolves, and about non-human primates, and tried to apply it to humans. This is doubly stupid: first, their model is wrong about every animal species I know something about.
For example, most alpha males aren’t all that aggressive, and they spend a lot of time making sure everyone else in the troupe or pack is fed. And alpha males generally don’t keep their position unless the alpha females support them. They don’t control who gets the sex in their group, because the females fuck who they want to. The females initiate a lot of the sex, and it seems that they like youth and good looks more than alpha status. Alpha males aren’t the aggressive ones, and they aren’t the studs: basically, they’re politicians.
Second, you can’t even apply models from chimps to bonobos, let alone from wolves or chimps to humans. It’s just embarrassingly stupid.
Also, the homo sapiens guys who think of themselves as alpha males, as they understand the term, tend to strut about doing a lot of body language and oration. And that’s just tedious.
So what’s this got to do with bdsm? Well, the PUA message seems to be getting more openly nasty as time goes on. There’s an increasing emphasis and acceptance of non-consensual scenarios.
For example, there’s the PUA “teacher” Julien Blanc who recommended that guys just go up to women, grab their heads and push them down towards the guy’s crotch. He showed footage of himself doing just that, in Japan. He got away with it, because he’s a gaijin, so the girls laughed because they were shocked and embarrassed about how weird and offensive he was being.
In Japan, laughter doesn’t necessarily mean the person laughing is having fun, or that they are enjoying you being around. Blanc was too stupid and arrogant to bother knowing anything about Japanese culture. It’s a pity no-one called a cop or kneed him in the bollocks: he couldn’t claim he didn’t understand that.
Blanc also recommends that men wear down women’s “bitch shield” (which seems to mean reluctance to spend time with Blanc or his “students”) by commanding them to “get down on your knees, call me Master, and BEG ME to kiss you.”
The use of bdsm tone and terms is becoming more common. There’s another PUA guy (not linking to him) whose training includes telling guys with poor social skills that many women will obey commands, and “secretly like to be commanded”.
This worries me because that’s actually true about many women, and not just women who identify as “submissive”. I’m not going to argue about why that is. Of course it’s partly cultural, and to some extent it’s also probably innate and part of our primate, even mammal, heritage. Dominance and confidence are survival traits, and they’re sexy. But there’s a reason why bdsm has so many caveats about consent, in particular informed consent.
If they want to be any good at domming, doms have to learn a lot about power and how to exercise it. And also how to not exercise dominance and power. At work, for example, I keep a very firm lid on all dom signs: body language, tone of voice and so on. As much as I can manage I’m mild-mannered Clark Kent, very polite and unassuming. In fact, I’m like that everywhere, except in the company of a submissive woman who knows who she is and who I am, and who has explicitly given me her consent.
But it is true that a man can give a woman (some women) small commands, and make the orders bigger by degrees. He can also make the orders more and more explicitly sexual, after that third glass, and he’ll probably get away with it. He may get her undressed and himself on her body. He may get a fuck out of it.
It’s just … Afterwards, she may be happy with that and she may not be. She probably wasn’t raped, in a legal sense, but she has good reason to feel that she was conned and manipulated. It’s rape-ish. Not necessarily a prosecutable crime, but certainly bad behaviour.
So my problem is that some bdsm skills, about mind-fucking and establishing dominance and submission, seem to be seeping into PUA teaching. But without the ethics.
The Jian Ghomeshi case, where Ghomeshi assaulted several women quite seriously, and then claimed he was doing consensual bdsm with them, was an early warning. Promoting behaviour control methods from bdsm, without including bdsm’s ethical rules – especially about informed consent – is dangerous and irresponsible. I don’t see it leading anywhere good.
* “Keep the sun out of your eyes and be yourselves” is said by the bad guy in Cherry 2000, whose dialogue is a mix of feelgood psychobabble and psycho-killer babble. I’m going to watch Cherry 2000 again soon. It’s probably terrible, but I’m curious to see if I’m still in lust with Melanie Griffith. There was something about her sullen face and squeaky little voice that deeply appealed to the schoolboy Jaime Mortimer. Phwoarr, I thought. Hope I still do.
Here’s a picture of bonobos being happy. I’m having a slightly miserable time of it at the moment. Your blogger is sad. But contemplating those guys cheers me up a lot. I hope it works for you, too.
I like bonobos a lot, but I won’t be writing about them again for a while. I feel like writing something sexy, and about humans.

We know that submission postures and the reddening of the genitals and buttocks are common to chimps, bonobos and humans. In humans the submissive presentation posture is a universally recognized sexual signal.
We know that that red sexual display died out in our hominid ancestors some time before we homo sapiens sapiens turned up, but we really don’t know when.
The fossil record is a long way from complete, and fossils mean bones, not flesh. Flesh decays, so we don’t know what our ancestors’ asses were like.
Presumably that red-hot perineum flush would have started to be less important in reproduction, and slowly die out, some time after our ancestors took up walking while standing up.
When you’re on your hind legs, your ass isn’t as prominent as it is when you’re on all fours, so a reddened ass is less effective as a sexual signal, and over time it will stop being selected for. But we don’t know when that was.
But it’s very likely that the importance of submissive display positions in primates is one of the reasons they still work so powerfully in bdsm. The reddened ass theory is more speculative, but it’s at least plausible.
Meredith Small, in her book, Female Choices: Sexual Behaviour of Female Primates, argued that male primatologists had often failed to observe what female primates were doing.
They interpreted primate sexual behaviour in terms of competition to be an alpha male, with the assumption that the alpha male had his pick of all the ladeeze.
It took women primatologists to see that female primates were initiating a lot of the sex, and that they, not some phalanx of alpha males, were choosing their partners. And they weren’t necessarily choosing the alpha males.
She argued for a kind of imaginative empathy. Female primatologists may be more likely to notice and interpret female primate behaviours that male primatologists have overlooked, because they are female.
My suspicion is that people who are attuned to bdsm, who’ve experienced it and take pleasure from it, may have some intuitive access to the experience of the primate submission ritual, that primatologists who haven’t experienced bdsm won’t have.
When chimps and bonobos are in conflict, getting close to a fight, and one of them assumes a submissive sexual position, the other primate may drop the aggression, and mounts the submissive. They rub genitals, and sometimes have sex.
Most primatologists have written that as if it’s a win-lose encounter. At least the submissive doesn’t get bashed up, but he or she is humiliated and defeated.
The rewards for the dominant primate who “wins” the exchange are the most obvious: there aren’t many of us primates who don’t enjoy triumph, power, sexual access, and so on.
But the submissive primate is also rewarded: fear turns to relief, anger turns to sex, and conflict, through the mounting, turns to connection, with the associated pleasure of sexual surrender – a pleasure that seems to be enjoyed by many animals as well as humans.
Both primates are highly aroused by the time their pre-fight postures change to sexual postures. The submission allows them both to channel that arousal into sex. The sexual presentation, the mounting, the thrusts, of primates aren;’t just symbolically “like” sex. They are sex.
Chimps and bonobos are highly sexed, and they enjoy a wide range of activities among their own and the opposite sex. So do we, only more so. They, or rather we, are all polymorphously perverse.
There’s a reason this bdsm-like behaviour, and pleasure, can survive and pass its way down to modern humans.
Primates who have the ability to turn conflict arousal into sexual arousal are likely to pass on their genes. If they can end a conflict with a dominance and submission ritual rather than a fight until one or both primates are severely injured, they will live longer and have more chances to pass on their genes.
Another factor is that primates with that ability are sexier: their sexual repertoire is slightly wider, and so they are likely to mate slightly more often. Throw in a couple of million years, and that will make a difference. Regardless of the mechanism by which it’s transmitted, that is, whatever the mix of genetic and “cultural” factors, the ability to sexualise dominance and submission seems to be part of our primate inheritance.
And, purely from the random chance of the DNA lottery, it seems that some humans have that trait more than others. So, is this one of the reasons bdsm exists in humans? It’s not certain, but it’s very probable.

Our closest relatives, chimps and bonobos, get seriously sexually interested when they see a submissive posture, and especially the sight of a red, hot ass, presented for their attention. In human bdsm, many doms feel the same way about the heat and colour of a disciplined submissive’s ass. So, is some of the force of our sexual response linked to our common hominid ancestry?
This is Vanessa Woods, a primatologist who’s lived with bonobos and contributed a lot to our knowledge of their social structures. She’s not responsible at all for suggesting a connection between bonobos and bdsm.
It’s certainly true that we’re closely related to chimps and bonobos. We evolved from the same ancestors, until the family branch split into homo, which is us, and pan, which is them, about 4 to 6 million years ago. That isn’t as long in evolutionary terms as it is when you’re waiting for a bus. We share about 95% of our DNA with our cousins.
It’s not just genetics. We have quite a few things in common with them that are, in a sense, cultural, including lots of the ways we show affection, the way we do violence (I mean, like two guys getting angry, not mechanised warfare), and quite a lot about the way we do sex. So it’s completely plausible that we, or some of us, are still in thrall to that ancestral sexual signal.
But we’re different from chimps and bonobos in two important ways. First, we don’t have a strong sexual cycle like them: chimp and bonobo females mostly only mate when they’re at the peak of their monthly reproductive cycle, so they need to signal when they’re most interested in fucking. Human women can fuck any time. No signal is needed, so it won’t be selected for.
Second, we walk upright. A sexual signal that works best when the ass is the highest and most prominent point of the body doesn’t work so well when you’re standing. So we humans don’t have that signal.
But I’ve also run her pic because I’m a fan; I’ve read her book, think she’s brilliant, ridiculously brave, and so on. And, like so many women primatologists, she’s gorgeous.
It’d be nice, really nice, if we knew how recently our ancestors lost that bright red sexual signal. Our ancestors probably had it, say, four million years ago, when we were still separating from chimps and bonobos.
We can look at our ancestors’ bones, but sadly, one thing that doesn’t fossilise is asses. All the hominid asses, the ones before homo sapiens sapiens, have rotted away and been eaten by worms, and we’ll never know a damn thing about them.
But we can make some guesses, some of which don’t seem to be completely stupid, and make the best use of the evidence we do have. That’s tomorrow.
As far as I’ve been able to find, the first person to suggest a connection between the reddening of human buttocks by whipping, and the red sexual swellings of chimps and bonobos, was Alex Comfort.
Bonobos would recognise that sexual presentation posture. This girl’s pose happens to be part of a bdsm scenario, but the pose is a sexual signal – for humans who like women – far beyond the bdsm world.
In his book, Nature and Human Nature, he wrote, “mammalian residues still persist in human sexuality, and we may underrate them. Blushing, and the interest of some individuals in the reddening of the buttocks caused by whipping, may contain echoes of the ‘releaser’ sex skin of lower primates.”
Rump presentation again, but with a cane-striped ass. People who aren’t into bdsm are likely to think the poor girl has been treated cruelly, and pity and shock will override sex. People who like bdsm are likely to think that the reddening makes her even sexier. So the reddened ass thing isn’t a universal human sexual response; it’s specific to some of us who like bdsm.
“The female sexual rump-presentation posture also occurs in humans,” Morris wrote. “It is there in corporal punishment, with rhythmic whipping replacing the rhythmic pelvic thrusts of the dominant male.”
He added that victims have their buttocks bared for punishment, not to increase the pain, but to allow the dom “to witness the reddening of the buttocks as the beating proceeds, which so vividly recalls the flushing of the primate female hindquarters when in full sexual condition.”
He thought corporal punishment in schools would end once teachers “fully appreciated the fact that, in reality, they were performing an ancient primate form of copulation with their pupils.”
But … that was fifty years ago. By now we should have gone beyond a bit of idle speculation by a pair of hippy-influenced primatologists*, shouldn’t we?
The claim is this. We doms, at least those of us who like to mark our submissives with impact play, get many different rewards and pleasures from admiring and fucking our submissives, usually from behind, after a beating.
One of those rewards is genetically hard-wired. Our immediate primate ancestors, like our cousins the chimps and bonobos, reacted to reddened, swollen, warmed asses with very strong sexual interest and arousal. That’s part of our heritage, through some mix of genetic and cultural factors, from our primate ancestry. It’s one of the reasons for our strong sexual reaction to the sight and feel of a freshly disciplined submissive.
Tomorrow I’m going to talk about what we need to know, in order to assess whether the claim is true. (And why we can’t find it.)
* Yeah, I know Comfort wrote on primatology but his main field was medicine. I just don’t want to write “a hippy-influenced doctor and a hippy-influenced primatologist”. Don’t rain on my phrases, ok?
There’s a connection, or an alleged connection, between the reddened ass of a freshly-disciplined submissive, and the strong sexual response of doms to that reddened, swollen sexual area, and the bright red, blood-swollen perineal swellings in bonobo and chimp females.
This is a young bonobo female up in a tree, flashing her perineal swelling. (Male bonobos looking up at her ass not shown.)
“Perineal” means that lovely, sexually sensitive skin from the vagina to the anus. When it swells up in bonobos and chimps, it becomes extremely, er, noticeable.
So the idea is that we doms, at least those of us with a taste for a freshly-disciplined girl or boy, are drawing on some powerfully atavistic urges from way back in our evolutionary ancestry.
In chimps and bonobos that swelling occurs at oestrus, the point in the menstrual cycle when the female is most likely to reproduce and to want to do a lot of fucking.
That red and swollen genital and buttock signal, that the female is receptive and interested, gets an extremely strong reaction from the males in the troupe. They’ll hang around her, trying for any sexual opportunity they can get. They’ll fight over her, or – if they think they’d lose a fight – they’ll wait until the dominant male is distracted, and nip in for a quick fuck before he notices.
By the way, her strategy isn’t to mate with the most dominant male. Her strategy is to get a lot of fucking done, with lots of males. The males who fuck her feel good about her, which is handy for getting food and protection and so on, and when she gives birth they’ll be unlikely to kill the offspring. Since it might be theirs.
(By the way, almost everything people say when they use terms like “alpha male” is complete, utter, abject bullshit. Especially if they apply those terms to humans, and especially in the highest, forever and ever, if they apply those terms to themselves. The only exception is the first sentence of this paragraph.)
Humans are different from our chimp and bonobo cousins, though. Human girls don’t get that red ass thing.
Yeah, you’re thinking, “Ah-hah! Except for submissive girls who’ve been bad, and submissive boys, too.” You’re way ahead of me, but there’s more to be said about this. For example, “is this theory actually true?”
Chimps and bonobos both use submissive sexual display to defuse confrontations. The ape who figures that he or she will lose a fight, if a fight gets started, assumes a sexually receptive position and holds it for the dominant’s consideration.
Presentation. These are baboons, who are old world monkeys and not as closely related to us as chimps or bonobos. But I couldn’t find a good bonobo rump presentation pic in which they weren’t already fucking.
Generally, that involves putting hands and feet on the ground, with their rump and genitals up and offered to the ape our chimp or bonobo doesn’t want to fight. Alternatively, the ape who doesn’t want a fight lies on their front, on the ground, with their rump arched up so that their genitals are vertically presented. Hey, they both work.
Usually this is reported as something that female apes and less dominant male apes do to appease dominant males. But it’s more flexible than that: male apes have also been observed offering the submissive presentation posture to dominant female apes, and female apes may offer it to other females.
The dominant ape may accept the display alone as being enough to establish friendly relations, or he or she may mount the submissively presented ape and make a few pelvic thrusts just to drive the point home. But with that, confrontation is over and peace is restored. The dominant and submissive ape may fuck at that point, but they don’t always.
The relevance to bdsm is fairly obvious. The submissive primate experiences fear, and the dominant experiences an emotion that may not have a name: let’s call it “conquest”. That tension builds up to a climactic point, and is then resolved in sexuality. That’s strongly reminiscent of the way human bdsm works, and pleasures us.
The submissive presentation postures that our chimp and bonobo cousins adopt arouse strong sexual reactions in humans, too, especially humans who enjoy bdsm.
It’s not just pleasurable for the human dominant who observes the submissive in that posture; it’s sexy for the submissive to place herself or himself that way.
My own reaction to being offered that submissive posture, at least from a submissive I desire, is very strong and very sexual, and it does seem to by-pass thought.
That’s not to say it’s innate or genetic, whatever “genetic” would even mean in relation to behaviour this complicated. It’s probably largely a learned behaviour and response in chimps, bonobos and humans, and some other apes, and it probably does build on some genetic elements.
But the link between dominance-submission and sex is part of a shared primate culture that doesn’t just pre-date language; it pre-dates hominids. (It’s arguably present in non-primates as well, but I’m only writing about our evolutionary neighbourhood.)
There’s something else we bdsm-loving humans may have adopted from our primate cousins: an interest in what Aldous Huxley called “the gorgeous buttocks of the ape”. But we can talk about asses tomorrow.
Bonobos. The bonobo female looking very relaxed. This has no great relevance to the topic. I’ve just always loved this photo.
We share over 98 per cent of our genes with chimps and bonobos, our closest kin. When we watch them we read their expressions and body language, and we often think that we know what they’re feeling.
That can tempt us into “explaining” human traits by finding some precedent for those traits in primate behaviour. That’s one reason why evolutionary psychology books sell well, but haven’t won much academic support. At its simplest, the evo psych bestseller involves selecting an aspect of the behaviour of one or two species and arguing that this explains similar behaviour in humans, or that it provides a model of “natural” behaviour for humans.
“Natural” primate behaviour includes male dominance, female resistance to male dominance, pair bonding, harem formation, and promiscuity. All of these things exist in different human cultures, but the existence of the primate models doesn’t mean that any of these options are particularly “natural” for humans.
There are human cultures in which powerful older men keep women in harems, and there are human cultures that don’t much interfere with female sexual choices. It seems unlikely that the harem cultures got that behaviour from common ancestry with harem-forming baboons, while cultures that endorse female sexual choice do so because of inheritances we share with bonobos.
But there’s something there, between us and our cousins. When we see a chimp or bonobo mother comforting a hurt infant, cradling the infant in her arms, gazing at it and pursing her lips and making soft sounds, patting it and stroking, we don’t really know what that mother or infant are thinking, but we probably do know quite a bit about their emotions. Sometimes the emotional situation, the gestures, the sounds and the expressions are so close to ours that it seems reasonable to suppose that we really do share some experiences and sets of feelings across the species divide.
This is relevant to bdsm because of the way submissive presentation postures seem to work in chimps and bonobos, in particular. So we’ll get to that tomorrow.

There are four posts a week. They tend to be fairly substantial, and either sexy, funny or informative, or some combination thereof.
Raylene looked at the bed. While her freshly-thrashed arse burned, she didn’t want anything to touch her bottom, not even the air. So a simple order like, “Bed,” presented her with challenges she didn’t know what to do with.
I kissed her. “I said ‘bed’, Raylene darling. Yes, you’ve had your ass caned. Looks nice and sore, too. Now you’re going to get your ass into bed.”
She grimaced. “If you don’t mind, Master, I think I’d prefer to stand for the next couple of years.”
And I reached down and gave her ass an open-palmed spank, as hard as I could. Raylene cried out in pain and some indignation. If I wasn’t going to feel sorry for her under those circumstances, then … when?
“Yes. We won’t say so too often, but yes, that’s exactly what it makes you.” I wasn’t sure that was true. But in the moment, sometimes I just say what I think will be hot.
“You’re property. I own you. I mentioned I’m falling in love with you, and I’ll look after you. But you don’t choose what you do, not anymore. Not once I’ve told you what to do.”
Raylene said nothing. She put her arms around me and let her breasts weigh on my chest. She clung to me like a jasmine.
She looked at me, big-eyed. “Well, I can’t think of any way of being in bed where the sheets won’t hurt me. Even if I lie flat on my tummy.”
“That’s right. You just got a hard lesson in behaviour. It’ll go on hurting a lot for an hour or two, I expect. But it’s over. And I don’t care that your ass still hurts. Understand that. You having a sore backside: it’ll happen to you whenever I see fit, and it does not matter if it hurts. Your pain does not matter. Not during. Not afterwards.”
Raylene had listened to this open-mouthed. She didn’t disagree. These were just things that hadn’t occurred to her before. “Oh. Ok.”
“So, get onto the bed. I’d going to fuck you. I need to fuck you. I think you need to be fucked. As if what you need matters.”
I kissed her. I suppose I don’t cane for irony. “Get up on the bed. Hands and knees. Get your ass up, and keep it up.”
“Yes, master.” And she scrambled up onto the bed, pulling the top sheet and blankets aside, and posing like a cat needing fucking.
“Good girl. I’m going to fuck you, pressed against that nice hot ass. I’m going to enjoy your heat. And I’m going to hurt you while I fuck you. What do you know about that?”
Raylene arched her back, presenting herself as spectacularly as she could. “I know now that it doesn’t matter if it hurts, Master.”
“Good girl. I knew you’re a clever girl.” And I took my clothes off and climbed up onto the bed with her, wanting her more desperately than I was going to tell her, and put my hands on her hips.
The last episode of this story was posted back in February, here. It’s very forgivable if you’ve forgotten, or never knew, that there is such a story.
“Humiliation of an ex-Nazi submissive” is the click-baity but entirely accurate title of the story of something that happened relatively early in my bdsm career. I’d been interviewing Raylene in her kitchen about her time with a neo-Nazi gang, which she’d joined to annoy her mother, at a bad time in her life. But then we discovered that she was submissive and I was a dom, and that we fancied each other. Things happened very quickly from there, though I’ve been telling it excruciatingly slowly.
When we left Raylene, she was being caned in front of witnesses. The witnesses were Dorabella, her half sister, and Lynette, who’d been trying to get Dorabella into bed.
By now, Lynette had switched her sexual ambition to Raylene and, to my surprise, me. But although we hadn’t liked each other much when we met yesterday, we’d exchanged breath, our tongues had touched the other’s teeth, and we’d fondled each other’s genitals: through my clothes in her case, but fingertips to soft wet skin in my case.
The attraction was real, and starting to feel urgent. So we’d interrupted Raylene’s caning to take a kissing break. To Raylene’s disbelief.
I could see her point. Generally, if you’re getting caned in front of witnesses, you should expect to be the centre of attention. But I’d shown Lynette that being humiliated was one of Raylene’s most favourite, hottest things. She’d caught on quickly, and she’d found that humbling Raylene made her feel wicked. She was starting to enjoy feeling wicked. All this added a pleasantly perverse edge to our kisses.
I slid my hands down to hold Lynette’s bare ass under her skirt, Lynette made a little “ah” sound, and straightened her back. She had a sensitive little arse: that was worth remembering. She explored my back under my shirt. Doing anything except pulling each other down to the floor and fucking then and there would clearly be ridiculous. But I said, “I said yes, Raylene. What do you want?”
I sighed ostentatiously, and said, still facing Lynette, “you’ve got the last six of your dozen to go. And there’s one penalty stroke. So far. So seven. Girl.”
Lynette smiled at me. She’d enjoyed our intimacy for its own sake and for its effect on Raylene. We hadn’t been to bed together yet – Lynette was to join Raylene and me at midnight that night – but we were already playing a pleasantly complex three-way sexual game. A subtle threesome.
Lynette pulled my shirt back down and picked up the cane, holding it the middle as Raylene had done, and passed it to me. She mouthed, “Duty calls.” Silently. She was still amused.
I turned and shook my head at Dorabella, who was at the other side of Rayleme’s desk, holding Raylene’s shoulders down. She’d been watching Lynette and me while we pressed bodies and mouths. Since Dorabella was the only person in the room who didn’t want to fuck Lynette, she was no doubt relieved that Lynette’s interest had switched. Anyway, Dorabella read my look correctly and nodded.
Raylene was to have no warning. I swung the cane, catching Raylene hard across the other stripes I’d already laid on the lower curves of her bottom.
The crack of cane meeting softly muscled flesh was followed by Raylene’s rising wail. Her legs kicked up, level with her body, and she fought Dorabella desperately to get up. She lost that struggle within a few seconds, and her toes touched the floor again. “Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck oooohhh…”
I knew I’d have to make the next stroke harder, to get the same reaction. So I made it harder. When Raylene settled her body again, she was still making that soft, almost mumbling cry. It was her pain song.
I gave her the remaining strokes at the same intensity, but she no longer reacted so dramatically. She was getting tired, and she was learning to take a hard caning. There was a kind of acceptance, which was deeper than the mainly verbal submission she’d given me to this moment. I wondered if she’d convinced herself that she deserved to be punished this severely, though she certainly didn’t.
When the last, penalty, stroke was delivered, I said, “that’s it for now, darling. You’ve been very good, and very brave for me. I’m proud of you, little Raylene.”
She was still producing tears, and singing her “oh fuck oh fuck” song, but she paused for long enough to say, “Thank you, master. And I’m sorry.”
“Good girl. My girl.” I raised my voice, into public speaking mode. “Raylene is going to thank you for witnessing her punishment. And she’s going to apologise to both of you for her rudeness last night. But she’ll make her formaI apology at dinner tonight. Right now, though, I think I’ve got a girl who needs looking after. Ah?”
It was Dorabella, again, who caught on fastest. She leaned down and kissed her sister’s forehead, then her cheek, and then walked to the door, bustling Lynette out with her. She said, “ok, we’ll leave you two alone for a while. And look in later and see if there’s anything you…”
Lynette said, “Need. Like cold cream?” She wanted to get back into the room. And maybe to get to apply it to Raylene’s glowing ass and thighs.
Raylene stopped singing “oh fuck oh fuck” and said, “I’ve got some. In a drawer. We’re fine.” She looked at me. I nodded.
“We’ll see you guys later.” I shut the door. I considered jamming a chair against the handle, in case Lynette thought of another way to get inside. The thought made me smile. I knew Raylene wanted to fuck Lynette as much as I did, and if Lynette was getting keen, and devious, that was no bad omen.
I took the cold cream from her top drawer, where it nestled against knickers and a small collection of vibes, I helped her rise, though she moaned when she straightened up. “That hurt, master. Oh fuck, that hurt so much.”
It wasn’t an accusation. And we kissed. I grinned at her. She looked puzzled, but she couldn’t see how bedraggled and woeful, and how triumphantly sexy, she looked. Oh well: I had plenty of time to tell her.
Beside me, Lynette sighed pleasurably. Languorously, with shining eyes. She was taking a video of the whole thing on my phone camera. She was enjoying watching Raylene’s anguished movements, her toe-clenched kicking and the writhing of her ass and thighs.
But at the very least that consideration didn’t interfere with her pleasure. She was also enjoying her flirtation with me. Actually we’d passed flirtation. She’d kissed me with tongue and enthusiasm. Back in the corridor, she’d put her hand on my cock.
That was the other puzzle in this room. Lynette had only come to this house because she’d been trying to get Dorabella into bed. Her first reaction to my presense, doing perverted things to Raylene on the stairs, had been openly hostile. I expected she had a fine line in “all men are bastards” conversation. I also suspected that she’d leaned on it while she was chasing Dorabella. And yet she was coming to bed with Raylene and me at mid-night. I was sure she’d demand penile, as it were, penetration.
I shrugged, mentally, and tapped the cane across the roundest, fullest, curves of Raylene’s bottom. The next two strokes would be the last of her two dozen. I was letting her know where to expect them. Raylene expelled a breath. “Master? God, it hurts… I’m so sorry, Lynette, I wish I hadn’t been rude to you.”
Lynette looked at me. A little earlier I’d encouraged her to be hard and unforgiving when Raylene asked for forgiveness. I smiled and nodded, giving permission. Lynette made her voice icy. “I know you’re sorry now, Raylene. But that’s only because you’re getting punished.”
Raylene made a shocked, nasal noise. Her arse rose and fell still, driven by burning pain. And lust.
Lynette frowned, a little unhappy with herself. Being cruel was fun, but as she’d found earlier, it was hard. She looked at me again. I made the OK symbol with my cane-free hand. “And it serves you right, Raylene. You were being a real bitch last night. Tell me again how sorry you are when he’s finished with you.”
Raylene wailed. I kissed Lynette again, for the sweet sake of it, and to let her know that she wasn’t a horrible person. She’d said the right thing, for Raylene’s pleasure and entertainment. Raylene said, “Master? Please, Master?”
She knew she was interrupting Lynette and me, and she was hesitant. In any case, she was about to ask a question, and I suspected she was scared of the possible answer.
I put my hands on Lynette’s ass, and she reciprocated. We kissed like people about to fuck. “Yes? Raylene?”
So there we were, at a dramatic moment. Raylene naked and bent over the table, bottom and upper thighs already well striped. There should be 19 welts, but they’d merged and crossed each other and I couldn’t count the marks any more in a general splash of corrugated red.
I’d tapped Raylene’s thighs, so she knew where the next strokes were going to go. I raised the cane, and whipped it down, twice, across the backs of her legs. I left little pause between them.
Stung, Raylene yowled and twisted, kicking her legs in the air, since it was the only movement she could make. I watched her with awe and desire, and listened to her pain song.
Dorabella, Raylene’s half sister, held Raylene’s shoulders down. She did it with real determination, leaving her robe flapping open.
I’d told her that if Raylene got up she’d get extra strokes, and that I’d give the same number to Dorabella. She hadn’t definitely conceded that I had the right to cane her, which wasn’t surprising since clearly I didn’t.
However, Dorabella was afraid that if I told her to take her place beside Raylene, presenting her arse for the cane, she’d do as she was told. By now, I was also pretty sure she wouldn’t disobey.
In the meantime, she was making sure the issue, and her choice, didn’t arise. She was taller than Raylene, and though they were both strong girls she’d made sure her extra height gave her the advantage.
There were puzzles there: Dorabella seemed to be enjoying herself too much. It didn’t seem to be sororal spite, where one sister will sometimes enjoy mild misfortune happening to the other. It was more that there was some sort of unacknowledged sexual vibe between the two of them. This was turning Dorabella on. I didn’t understand quite what was going on, but there was no doubt that Dorabella was aroused.
I gave Raylene two more strokes, quite firmly, and fast. This time I aimed high, getting them as close as possible to that wonderful fleshy crease where the thighs and buttocks meet. Raylene screamed, head shaking and hair flying. feet lifting from the carpet, and kicking in the air, until they were the highest part of of her body. Dorabella fought Raylene down again until she subsided.
Lynette had watched Lynette’s struggles, now with extra red stripes across the tops of her thighs, and Dorabella’s breasts while she fought to keep Raylene in place across her desk.
She stepped closer to me so we watched together, breathing in unison. Lynette whispered to me, “Fuck, that’s hot.”
I kissed her. She put her hands on the back of my head and kissed back. She meant it, as did I. So we were engrossed for a time.
Lynette did nothing to keep her body away from my erection, even when I slipped my free hand under her skirt, to cup and then squeeze her ass. Eventually I took a breath and smiled. “Well, that’s up to you.”
At surface level it meant I wouldn’t cane her unless she asked me too. But I’d also meant that I wouldn’t cane her if she behaved herself, but I might if she didn’t: and how she behaved was up to her.
“Can’t have play if you don’t have ambiguity,” I said, which can’t possibly be true, so I distracted her, reaching my fingers under her ass to stroke damp, soft, perineal skin. Lynette closed her eyes, still kissing me.
Dorabella made an unconvincing cough noise. She hadn’t let Raylene get her body off the desk, so she’d been good. And Raylene was back under her own control, her body still and expectant, her feet well parted and her bottom posed and poised for the cane.
So I gave Lynette the look that means duty calls, and she nodded. But my fingertips reached, and pressed against, the outer folds of her cunt, and she made a sweet, soft sound. But I withdrew my hand after a few seconds, shaking my head. “We’ll want you here one minute past twelve, Lynette. Don’t you be a second late.”
“Ok.” We looked each other in the eyes. We were both going to fuck Raylene after midnight, and then each other. And so the night would pass. But right now…
I picked up the cane, looked into Dorabella’s eyes for a few seconds, and said, “That was well done.” She glanced for a second at the cane in my hand, but said nothing. Silence is another type of ambiguity.
I tapped the bamboo across Raylene’s upper thighs. She’d already taken a few strokes on that most sensitive flesh, but now I was going to mark them properly.
Those stripes would still be burning when I fucked her, whether I put her on her back or took her from behind. And I was certain that Raylene wanted that pain as much as I did.

This is a story about something that happened relatively early in my bdsm career. But I’d been doing wicked things long enough to learn that submissive women, though wonderful, aren’t made of porcelain, and that it’s not necessarily bad if I made a submissive woman cry. In the right way, not because of emotional hurt.
Also, I was about half-way out about bdsm, not through my own choice but because I had ex-girlfriends who gossiped with their friends that – with their consent – I spanked them and told them what to do. That meant that some women avoided going to bed with me, while others would pop round to see me, precisely because of that.
It was Raylene, heroine of our story, who made me realise that my interest in bdsm wasn’t so much a secret as a reputation, at least in the circle of women I knew, and that there was a good side to being a safe, non-scary bad boy.
The last episode of this story was posted back in October. We left Raylene naked, with a sore ass, bent over her bedroom desk and about to get her second dozen, enjoying the sexual admiration of two girls (one of them her half-sister, so that didn’t entirely count, except that in complicated ways it did count) and the intense sexual appreciation of one man: me.
A lot of things had happened very quickly between Raylene and me, once I recognised who and what she was. It helped that Raylene already knew about me, and steered things in the direction she wanted to go. I was following, while thinking I was leading.
Anyway, she liked submission, and she was no end of an exhibitionist, so she was brightly striped and giddily happy. If you want to see where we are and how we got here, that post is here.
We were all in position. Lynette taking video with my cellphone, Dorabella pushing Raylene’s shoulders down, under threat of getting a share of Raylene’s extra strokes if she let Raylene get up, and me, holding the heavier cane and visibly pleased about the while situation.
I’d tapped the cane against the tops of Raylene’s thighs, to let her know that was going to be a target area. Still, it was a new cane, a bit thicker than the one I’d given the first dozen with, so I swung it medium-hard, against the most excellenty padded part of her bottom.
Raylene jerked under the impact, so that Dorabella tensed, ready to wrestle her down. She grunted, than arched her ass up for the next stroke.
There was nothing Raylene could do that wouldn’t have the effect of turning me on, but I realised I missed the soprano pain-sounds she’d been making during the first dozen strokes. To get those sounds I could go a little harder, and I would, but there was another option.
“Yes, master.” I couldn’t see her face, but she was being a good girl now. An ostentatiously good girl. So I was sure she’d be looking as if she was at the dentist.
Then I applied the second stroke, a little lower and a little harder. Her whole body jerked under the impact, with a flurry of blue-green hair. Her breath hissed out, then she drew a fresh breath. She said, “Uh, uh, ahhhh…” before she had herself back under control.
It took two more strokes, each lower and harder than the last, before Raylene resumed soprano voice, and her pain-song.
I wasn’t sure why I liked that sound so much, I mean liked it so very, very, much. But it was at once the hottest and most tender sound in the universe.
And once we’d reached that place, I gave Raylene two fast hard strokes across the tops of her thighs.
That made her all activity, legs kicking, arms waving, trying to get purchase on her desk, while she sang that sweet, incoherent song.
Dorabella had to push down with all her strength. Her robe fell open, and both Lynette and I watched their struggle. Lynette’s mouth fell open too.
I said, “That’s six, Raylene. You’ve been good, and brave. But there’s six to go, plus the one penalty stroke.”
Followers of this blog, even casual visitors, have possibly noticed that there is a long, long story going on, in which I met Raylene, the half-sister of an ex of mine, to interview her about her time with a neo-Nazi gang.
But we moved fairly quickly from journalism to sex. There haven’t been any new episodes for a while, because I’ve been busy with other things.
When I left the Raylene saga, she was in her bedroom getting the cane in front of her half-sister, Dorabella, and Lynette, the woman who wanted to be Dorabella’s girlfriend. The smell of female – and male – sexual arousal hung heavy in the air. It was one of the best moments in my life so far, believe me.
I’m going to continue that story shortly. At least until I’ve got Raylene and I in bed, with the other two women departed for a while.
The story has a way to run after that, but I want to tell two other stories before I continue from that point.
So we’ll have a brief continuation of Humiliation of an ex-Nazi submissive, until I feel I’ve taken everyone to someplace they can be happy while I ignore them (and us) for a while.
Then we’re going to tell two other stories, which are a lot shorter than the Raylene saga. One of them features the reappearance of an old friend, and I’m hardly in it myself. The other reveals me to be a bit of a slut, also a scoundrel, on occasion.
I suppose I should also do my Anal Hook user’s report, since I promised that a year or so ago. I get there eventually, you know. But I’m a busy man, also a lazy one, and anyway I’ve learned that anticipation is no bad thing.
If you want to read or re-read the Raylene saga, you can find all the episodes by clicking on the tag, “Humiliation of an ex-Nazi submissive”, just below this post.
Lynette was first in the room. She stood at the door for a while, watching Raylene’s ass as she joggled and ran on the spot, lifting her knees high. Then she looked at me.
I glanced down. I was in swollen condition, that was pretty obvious even through my jeans. “Okay. I meant reducing swelling for Raylene’s ass.” Raylene glanced at me. It seemed to be some sort of warning. Maybe I was saying her bum looked big, wearing nothing but cane stripes. “But it’s not universally effective, no.”
Dorabella was still staring at my cock. I’m a short stocky guy, and that’s about the best you can say for my looks. But for now I was a sex object. That doesn’t happen enough for me to get sick of it. So I smiled at Dorabella, and at Lynette. No reason. Just happy.
She stopped. Her breasts stopped a couple of seconds later. I waited that couple of seconds, because that was beautiful and distracting. “Good girl. You’re doing well, Raylene.” She nodded, knowing that praise, though good, wasn’t where I was going. “But I’m going to give you your second dozen now. Well, a dozen, and one penalty stroke. Baker’s dozen.”
She nodded again, face serious, as if some part of her believed this was fair and right. I said, “So I want you to bend over the desk again now. Same position. Same conditions: don’t get up or you’ll be in trouble.”
Dorabella and Lynette walked all the way into the room while Raylene said, “Yes, master,” and pressed the tops of her thighs against the edge of the desk before leaning forward and lowering her body to rest on the cold, cold wood.
Then I decided that I wasn’t kidding. If I gave Raylene extra strokes for getting up, I’d tell Dorabella she was getting the same, and to drop the robe and bend over on her side of the desk, facing her sister.
I’d look stupid if she refused, and I’d just have to back down as gracefully as I could. But I figured I should try, and leave Dorabella to flip the coin. If she obeyed, she’d get three strokes and then the attention would go back to Raylene. But that would give her plenty to mull over until our time tomorrow. Anyway, Dorabella wasn’t going let Raylene get up, so it was likely to be a hypothetical problem.
While Dorabella took her place at the other side of the desk, hands pressed firmly down on Raylene’s shoulders, I passed Lynette my phone again. “Filming duty.”
“Yes, sir!” The “sir” was mockery, still, but I didn’t mind. Irony isn’t as powerful as some people think. Lynette took the phone, activated the camera, and then filmed the front of my jeans. I snorted laughter, and after a second so did she. She switched to focus on Raylene’s ass.
I tapped the cane against the tops of Raylene’s thighs. This second dozen would give more attention to her thighs. It seemed only fair.
While she complied I tapped the cane against the same place at the top of her thighs, but a little harder so that she winced, and a new, pinkish stripe formed.
She laughed again. “You! You’re not making it up as you go along. You know exactly what you’re doing.”
I decided to leave that unchallenged. It wasn’t remotely true, but it was good that she thought so. So I shrugged, I hope ambiguously. “Anyway, I’m falling in love with you. And, you don’t have to fall in love with me. I just blurted.”
“Yeah.” To mark of the end of one sensitive conversation, and to remind her of other sensitivities, I smacked her ass, hot and welted under my hand.
So I smacked her again, then let my hand stay, stroking her. Firm, beautifully rounded, a little rough where the cane had directly landed, and blazing heat.
“Well, this is peak hurt. It lasts maybe half an hour from the last cane stroke, though it’ll keep on hurting quite a lot, slightly lower level, for a couple of hours. Especially after I’ve given you the second dozen.”
“Good girl. It’ll maybe hurt most of today. Though it’ll be at a lower level. You’ll feel it, but it’ll be background. And you’ll probably like it. A nice, sexy, buzzing feeling. And I’ll be looking after you. And for the next couple days you’ll get a reminder any time you sit down. Or, I don’t know, walk backwards into anything. And don’t forget I can bring you back to peak hurt anytime, just by smacking you hard with my hand. And I won’t hesitate, if you’re out of line for a second. You put the Me in Master.”
I put the cane in her mouth, for her to hold. And I put my cock all the way back inside my jeans “On the spot. Running. Get your knees up.”
Raylene lifted her knees. I could hear Dorabella, still talking, in the corridor. Raylene jogged and jiggled, with her spectacular back to the door.
There was a pause while Dorabella, Lynette and I gazed at Raylene, who stood straight, her hands on her head forcing her gaze down slightly. The floor; the visual fascination of floors, for submissives. Her buttocks well and redly striped, with a few downward-sloping welts on her upper right thigh where the end of the cane had whipped. Those would be hurting.
Her face was flushed with sobbing, and her cheeks still wet with tears. Her upper lip was shiny, unromantically enough, with phlegm. I took the tissues box and stepped in front of her so she could watch me.
“Good girl.” I wiped her face clean and dry, dabbing at the tears and wiping her lip, then holding a handful of tissues to her nose. She leaned forward at the waist and blew. After four fierce snorts, head shaking and many, many tissues, she smiled and straightened up. She could breathe through her nose. Then we looked into each other’s eyes.
Dorabella suddenly sang out, “Loo break! Loo break!” She put her arm round Lynette’s shoulder – Lynette had been slower to react – and bustled them both to the door. “Come on, we can, oh, powder our noses. Girl stuff! Exciting!”
So Raylene and I were suddenly alone, in a silent room. I put my hands on her back, just above the highest cane stroke, and pulled her close. “Subtle, your sister, isn’t she?”
Raylene laughed suddenly. She hadn’t expected to be laughing anytime soon. “Like a truck!” She shook her head, amused, then lifted her face up to be kissed. I provided kisses. Time passed. I could hear Dorabella and Lynette in the bathroom, though I couldn’t make out what they were saying. Dorabella was doing most of the talking.
“Yeah, sorry. The awkward declaration. You don’t have to … reciprocate. I mean you have to do as you’re told. But your emotions, they’re mostly up to you. It’s true, but I didn’t mean to put you on the spot. You know. I can’t take it back, but – ”
“Shut up.” I must have looked astonished. “Shut up, Master. I don’t know, Master. I know you weren’t trying to put me on the spot. And it’s not like it’s a bad thing. How can I mind you falling in love with me? “
I said, as I had to Lynette in similar circumstances, “Ah fuck…” But to Raylene I added, “And I really need to fuck you.”
“Yeah. Oh, yeah.” That was enthusiasm. She took her hands down and stroked me. My mouth fell open, information from my cock and its soft handling over-riding all else. I had nothing to say.
“You can’t have had any doubt, though. Very happy to be your Master. Fucking happy. Going to fuck you.” I was still being stroked.
She didn’t stop. I couldn’t tell her to stop. “Well, we’re going pretty fast. If I’m calling you Master, that’s a pretty big commitment anyway. And I don’t mind that. And I mean it too, I mean everything that goes with it. Whatever that is.”

I've had almost a week now to recover after my trip to Haiti so it is about time I recorded my experience in this blog. I kept a diary of my trip so I could be as accurate as possible. I also need to tell you that my safari was organised by BMS World Mission, Haiti Hospital Appeal,and The Dream so many thanks to them for allowing me the opportunity to visit the poorest country in the world.
I was up early to prepare myself for my trip to Haiti. We were flying from Heathrow and Eddie, my driver from home, made the journey really comfortable. I've been using Eddie for years now on my longer journeys and he is an excellent driver and good company. I met up with the Revd Gareth Wilde, who works for BMS, and we headed off to check in. We were flying to Miami with Virgin and I felt a bit embarrassed when they gave us V.I.P treatment because I was supposed to be a 'celebrity'. Anyway, I didn't complain when they made us feel important. All the staff were excellent, especially Becki, so thank you Virgin for a trouble free flight, and the free champagne.
It was a bit chaotic when we landed and got into the airport. Everyone seemed to be speaking Spanish and it was if we had landed in Spain, not Miami.We drove to our hotel, the aptly named 'Comfort Inn', and after a bath and supper, I went to bed and had a good nights sleep.
We flew from Miami to the Dominican Republic, but not before I had been subjected to a thorough search by a woman who clearly enjoyed her job! They also searched my wheelchair for explosives and one man asked me if I was an athlete because I had 'a fit body'. If that was supposed to cheer me up it didn't work and I was very relieved once we had boarded our plane. We should have been flying directly to Haiti but IBC airline refuses to carry wheelchair users. Very ironic, given that I was on my way to help disabled Haitians overcome prejudice!
Our flight was fine and we were driven to the Blue Bay by Alex. It was like paradise and strongly reminded me of the Kenyan Coastal region, lots of palm trees and beautiful blue sea. We ate and had an early night so we could be ready for the road trip to Haiti in the morning.
After breakfast Alex arrived to drive us to the border in his car. The scenery was beautiful and again reminded me of my native Kenya. Swarms of motorbikes weaved around us as music by a local artist, Romeo Santos played. I loved the music and it seemed to fit so well with the scenery, even though I couldn't understand a word of what was being sung. As we approached the border the scenery changed dramatically and it wasn't hard to believe we were about to enter another country. I was dying to use the toilet but we couldn't find one until we finally arrived at the border. It wasn't disabled friendly but it did the job!
Alex told us we had arrived at the border and he and Gareth got out to negotiate our crossing. Alex wasn't allowed to drive across the border so they had to get my wheelchair out and I had to push myself across the border. That's a first for me! It was really scary seeing men in ordinary clothes wielding guns and I did NOT feel safe. As soon as I got into my chair people gathered around to stare at it, and me. I really wanted to speak to them but could only smile because of the language barrier. So frustrating! I particularly noticed three small boys, about the same age as my son, Tim, 10. They were speaking to me in Creole and I couldn't understand a word. I had no problem understanding what they wanted though as they pointed to their mouths and rubbed their stomachs. I had no money or food with me and all I could do was give them half a bottle of water! It breaks my heart even now as I write about it! Half a bottle of water and they all said,'Gracias'. And this was only the border.
We said our goodbyes to Alex and were then met by Mike, his wife Melissa, and their daughter, Emilee. Mike speaks a little Creole, just enough to get us into Haiti, and then we got into the hospitals ambulance for the journey to Cap Haitian and the Haitian Hospital Appeal, a fantastic project. It is run by co - founder Carwyn Hill and his wife Reninca and they gave us a wonderful welcome when we arrived. I was really keen to meet with some of the spinal cord injury patients undergoing rehabilitation at the centre and soon I met Leon, a hand cyclist and who hopes to be a Paralympian for Haiti one day. It really moved me when I learned that his wife and EIGHT children were killed in the earthquake. I can't even begin to even imagine what that would feel like, and to be left disabled himself! He is a REAL inspiration and thanks to the centre's forward thinking on the benefits of sport he has improved his quality of life.
The hospital is a wonderful facility and provides so much to so many people, including an ambulance service, community health care,maternity unit, rehab unit, and work with disabled children.
The volunteer village is very basic accommodation but very clean, with mosquito nets over the bed, and a fan. Food is very basic but I really enjoyed the Haitian style rice and beans we had tonight. We ate and socialised in the lounge before heading to bed.
I had problems getting to sleep in the volunteer village because when I got to my room I had two uninvited guests, a huge frog and a greasy black millipede. Why am I so scared of the insects here when I've spent most of my life in Kenya? Well, I struggled with insects in Kenya but the insects in Haiti!!! Even Samson couldn't wrestle with them. They are HUGE!! Tom the cameraman was even more frightened than me and we all laughed as he shrieked. My mind ran through the events of the day in bed. I did finally fall asleep.
When I woke in the morning the first thing I normally would do is get dressed and put on a little make up, but here it is too hot so I didn't bother. After a breakfast of fruit, juice and a bun, we visited Maison De Benediction ( which means 'house of blessings'). Its a respite centre for children with mental and physical disabilities. Haiti has an appalling attitude towards disability of any kind, and the disabled are often abused and called,'Cocoabi', which means 'worthless'. The centre encourages the families of disabled children to stay with them and support them. The children stay at the centre for a few days to give their families a break, and whilst they are there they have individual programmes in education, sport and physiotherapy.
As soon as I entered the centre I was overwhelmed by emotions. It brought back memories of when I was a child and my parents sent me away to a boarding school far away from home because the village school didn't cater for my needs. The children were lovely and their smiles really touched me but I just felt very sad when I thought of the many thousands who can't have a service like this. One encouraging and heart warming - I could see hope in the children's eyes and nothing is more important than that. Another very positive thing I can say is that the dedication of all the staff is truly wonderful. May God bless them.It reminded me of my early years in Kenya at Joyland School For the Physically handicapped and how loving and caring the staff were.We called them 'mother' :)
In the afternoon we made the journey to a village called Grande Riviere du Nord. It is a very poor and deprived area.The kids were naked, some of them the same age as my son! The villagers gathered around us when we arrived and through our translator, Usvel, I asked them what they thought I did for a living. They thought I was there to give them health advice and when I told them I was an athlete they were astonished. I asked them if they had ever seen a disabled person doing sport and they laughed and said how could they do sport if they're disabled! I spent some time with a young girl and her parents,who obviously loved her because they had crafted a home made 'wheelchair' from a plastic seat and some wheels, one of which was broken. Imagine how just an ordinary wheelchair could enhance their lives.Heartbreaking!
Today we visited 3 different primary schools, very small, but the children were very excited to see us and their smiles were beautiful. I felt sad when I didn't see a single disabled child in any of the schools. Life is very, very tough for able bodied Haitians, but the disabled and their families have it even worse, if you can imagine such a thing. Poverty is everywhere,yet we are only two hours from the USA!
I spoke to families with disabled children and it made me cry. It is heartbreaking to hear their stories. A 16 year old girl can't access education because she has to look after her disabled brother whilst her mother has to go out to work to feed them. Another mother has a very bad back after years of carrying her disabled son around. A woman with a disabled child begged us to take it so she can be accepted in her community. She tells me she has tried many times to give her child away to an orphanage but they refuse.
This morning I met Josue Cajuste who is so charming and a star in his own right. He also hopes to represent Haiti at the London 2012 Paralympic Games in field events. We did a little training together and I was able to show him some basic upper body warm ups and warm downs. We invited the patients from Rehab to join us and we had so much fun together. I also had a chat with Leon Gaysil and I told them both of my first experience of the Paralympic Games in Athens in 2004 and how it had helped change attitudes towards disability in Kenya. I hope these two men can do the same thing in Haiti one day.
In the afternoon I spoke to the staff and patients in the Rehab Centre. I spoke to them about the importance of sport and how it can benefit them in so many ways. One thing I made clear to them all was that they are in charge of the person they want to be, and that hope and determination are essential to achieving their goals. I also told them that life can be really cruel living with a disability but you have to have self acceptance if you want to be accepted by your community, you have to be assertive and a little pushy, but they must always look on the bright side of life.Disability does NOT mean inability.
Later I spent some time with Janine, a lovely 38 year old woman, very soft spoken. I listened as she told me how she is in constant pain after being shot several times by armed robbers in her own home. One bullet is lodged near her heart and can't be removed because they don't have the facilities.This happened seven years ago and she is paralysed from the chest down. She never sees her family because they live too far away and it is too expensive to travel. The Haiti Hospital Appeal has become Janine's home. And I sometimes think I have problems!
Cajuste decided to take me into Cap Haitien, the second largest city in Haiti. He wanted us to 'roll in style' but the community won't allow it. Everyone stares at us as if we have just arrived from another planet, and I can feel their hatred. It still shocks me now as I write this, people staring at us with hatred just because we have a disability. It feels more like 1612 than 2012! Despite all this Cajuste and I are determined to enjoy ourselves as much as possible and he says we should visit the beach. I was totally shocked when I saw the 'beach', or rather didn't see it because it was covered with rubbish and the sea was a filthy brown. My goodness, I couldn't even imagine having to live here. We rolled, very slowly , through the streets which are NOT accessible to wheelchairs. It was so sad having to endure the hostile stares that screamed disability at us. My sadness turned to mischief when I asked a group of men playing dominoes if I could join in. To Cajuste's astonishment they agreed. In Haiti women do not play dominoes, never mind disabled ones. I only played for a few minutes because I don't know the rules. I just wanted to make a little stand and I'm glad I did.
In the afternoon we did some training on the hand bike with one of the most promising athletes in Haiti, Fristna. He used to be a carpenter but was shot by a man who accused him of overcharging for his work! His whole family turned their backs on him so now he's completely alone. I hope sport can be his way of achieving success. He certainly has the talent.
We left the Haitian Hospital Appeal Centre to make our way back across the border into the Dominican Republic, and then make our way back to the UK.
My final thoughts on my experience? It was a very,very emotional trip. I can't remember the time I shed so many tears. The poverty in Haiti is unbelievable and it is everywhere you look. The disabled are firmly at the bottom of society. And here we are, looking forward to the Paralympic and Olympic Games and talking about medals and all the glory that is reflected whilst here is a country that can't even feed itself. This is a country where children go naked because they have no clothes! It was heartbreaking to see how totally marginalised and isolated the disabled and their families are. They have next to nothing going for them, There is no education, no access to healthcare, and there is nothing like accessibility for people with disabilities in this country.
On a more positive note, The Haiti Hospital Appeal, Carwyn and Reninca and all the staff and volunteers are showing real Christian values in the fantastic work they do transforming the lives of so many people, giving them a new lease of life. It's also been a huge blessing spending time with the children and seeing them smile. They really touched me. They reminded me of myself growing up with a disability in Kenya. Someone invested in me when I was a child and I am who I am today because of the sacrifice of others. I am determined to do all I can to support the Haitian hospital Appeal so others can benefit as I did. God bless them all!!

The term often describes a bond between two people that mimics the closeness and emotional intimacy of a romantic relationship while never being physically consummated. An emotional affair is sometimes referred to as an affair of the heart. An emotional affair may emerge from a friendship, and progress toward greater levels of personal intimacy and attachment. What distinguishes an emotional affair from a friendship is the assumption of emotional roles between the two participants that mimic of those of an actual relationship - with regards to confiding personal information and turning to the other person during moments of vulnerability or need.
Every individual is responsible to know the truth as best they can. Ignorance should never be allowed or left without criticism. In 1994 I started a serious look at evolution and wrote many scientists, Nobel Laureates about God and evolution and after I was done, I was shocked how little evidence there is that supports evolution. I suppose Stephen Jay Gould of Harvard (now dead) sums up the problem, there will never be found missing links in the fossil record . He latter changed this comment because he was attacked by both evolutionists and creationists but Gould was right. As a Christian, I say there will never be found any missing links in the fossil evidence because there is none.
That's always what happens though, in trying to elevate one mindset/viewpoint, the opposite gets kicked down, instead of made to match....at least for a while.
Right. They couldn't observe fossils as fossils but did observe that X species always gave rise to X species. But as I said, they didn't have an idea of mutation over unimaginably long periods that would permit species-change. It just wasn't in their vocabulary and expectation.
In as sense it did end for them with in their generation It ended the reality of their then religious Beliefs and the power of the priesthood that enforced the law.
The history recorded in the Bible is not fiction. I've discovered and learned personally that the word of God is true. Use the KJV as your main Bible. And considering that you have turned to God in sincere repentance, and sincerely seeked God in prayer about His word, then you should know God and His word. But you don't. And you are lying about Him.
Really? Brave, but I think teaching that all religions are fiction, with no basis or evidence to support them at all, might just trigger an enormous backlash from those who still believe in primitive superstitions. Might be more pragmatic to just avoid the topic in schools. That allows parents to raise their own children as they want without having others impose their religious beliefs on other people's children.
I want to run away (as could be expected with adrenaline) during panic attacks ... it's a lonely affair until it subsides, because not much my SO can do to help.
Yeah and my Cherokee ancestors stated that the earth was created from a water beetle diving under the world wide ocean too. I love my Cherokee ancestors, but hey, I do not buy their creation myth just like I do not buy your creation myth.
There is a lake in Japan surrounded by trees, every autumn the trees loose their leaves and some of them fall in to the lake.
God was always there. He spoke, ( as a phrase that we as humans can understand), and the big bang happened.
And i disagree with your opinion. You can turn on any television channel and there is some sort of doubt being cast upon the president.

If you're a woman might I ask if you've ever changed your mind about something you swore you'd never do?
The bibles clear in Romans. Yes...if you want to get into it, Gods views toward homosexuality is clear from Leviticus too. If perhaps, Paul didn't point it out...and so clearly, it may have given a few room to compromise. Its there. Honestly, I don't see how anyone can take it any other way from the law.
I suppose you may be correct. I can think of a few ladies in particular fancy dresses that stand out in my mind in retrospect.
And you're right. But what we have is claims of gods. Not evidence of gods. Just like the Harry Potter books aren't evidence of wizards or of trolls or of giants, these holy books aren't evidence of gods or wizards or trolls or giants.
I am disarmed by your generosity of spirit...that said, please dispose of yourself forthwith....it's for the public good!

To me there’s no real winter without snow; it just makes everything feel so fresh and cosy. Light and ice reflect the sunlight so beautifully.
This image is based on a photo by MoveMoon on instagram and was posted in her stories some time ago. When I saw this image it just instantly reminded me of home, and all the things I love about winter.
Welcome to the parish website covering the villages of The Bourtons in the Cherwell District of Oxfordshire.
Since their opening day, Rob and Jodie Gregory have been busy refurbishing all areas to provide a very welcoming place to be. Their new calendar of events includes a quiz night and Live Music, Sandwich clubs, Tapas Thursday and Fishy Friday and a Sunday brunch & lunch. Here is the October calendar for you to choose from.
The Bell Inn was originally thatched and attached to a cottage which stuck out into the road. It was rebuilt in the 1920s after a fire. Hidden away in the ridge of the roof on both the northern and southern sides of the pub are Hook Norton beer bottles built into the brick work.
From the pub there is a good view of the bell tower which is detached from the church. It is said that there are only two other places in England where the church bell tower is sited away from the church.
The Bell, is a good, old fashioned community based family pub, where people come in to meet their friends, have a drink and enjoy simple, home cooked food.
All are welcome including dog walkers. There is a small restaurant with freshly cooked food, and, of course, real ale!

I'm currently into being natural! Being natural does not mean neglecting my personal hygiene and self grooming. Also, I'm not against artificial beauty or plastic surgery. It's just my preference that being natural is the best I can be. At the moment of course, I'm not sure if I change my mind in the future!
Heavy makeup is the worst enemy for the skin! I try not to wear any makeup at all nowadays. It saves my time to get ready when going out!
To maintain healthy and glossy skin is a long term commitment! I apply moisturizer every night and wear sunblock in day time, exfoliate and put on a mask once or twice a week! It's nothing have to do with good skin genes, just diligent skin care regimen!

Unless you have been living under a rock or in a galaxy far, far away, you know that “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” opens today, and as you can probably tell by now, I am a big fan of the Star Wars franchise.
Since the franchise began in the ’70’s, it has entertained us and maybe taught a few lessons along the way from our favorite characters like Yoda, Obi-Wan and Luke Skywalker.
As silly as this may sound, as I look back on my business experiences, I’ve learned several key hard-to-learn lessons that if I had looked at certain decisions through the lens of Star Wars, it might have saved a lot of time and money.
Below are six lessons that business owners could apply today that may take your status from Apprentice to Jedi Master.
1. Be a Rebel and go against the flow. Businesses that are “clones” of others aren’t original. What makes you and your business different? Embrace the unique qualities and communicate that to the marketplace.
2. Follow a trusted guide. Just like Yoda or Obi-Wan, seek out someone who has solid advice for you and then follow it. You can learn a lot from the mistakes and wisdom of others.
3. Ultimately, be a Yoda, not a Luke. This applies to team members, clients or anyone else that you can have an impact on. Try not to be the hero in this epic saga, be a guide. You will find far more success by helping others find their own way.
4. Trust the Force. You can never go wrong with taking the high road. When it all comes down to it, sometimes you just have to make a decision and then live with it.
5. Don’t cut corners. No one said that success or defeating the Death Star was easy. It takes hustle and risks.
6. Work hard, but party like an Ewok. Running a business is tough. It takes a lot of blood, sweat and tears. When you do have successes along the journey, it is important to celebrate those.
There will be many Siths and evil-doers along your journey, but you are writing your own script. Don’t let the Empire win the day. Remember these tips and “success you will find,” as Yoda would say.
Canadians are heading back to the Northwest Passage this summer to continue searching for the wrecks of Sir John Franklin's lost ships from 1845. Researchers will also explore wreck of HMS Investigator, found in 2010
Archeologists with Parks Canada will use an autonomous underwater vehicle to scan the ocean floor, as part of this year's search for HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, federal Environment Minister Peter Kent said Thursday. "This is the year I hope that we will solve one of the great mysteries of the history of Arctic exploration — the location and the final resting place of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror," Kent told reporters in Ottawa.
The two ships disappeared during the British explorer's ill-fated 1845 expedition to chart the Northwest Passage. Neither Franklin nor any of his 128 crewmen returned. Historians in Canada, Britain and beyond have since been captivated by Franklin's doomed journey and the possible resting places of the Erebus and Terror, but only traces of the expedition have ever been found.
The Parks Canada research teams will begin searching for Erebus and Terror on Aug. 21, weather permitting, in an area west of King William Island in Nunavut. This will be the third summer in recent years that the Canadian government is funding a large-scale expedition to find Franklin's lost ships.
Archeologists found the wreck of HMS Investigator at the bottom of Mercy Bay, near Banks Island in the Northwest Territories, in July 2010. Parks Canada Similar searches conducted in 2008 and 2010 failed to locate the wrecks, although the 2008 search uncovered small bits of copper sheeting that may have belonged to Franklin's ships.
A search effort was called off in 2009 because Parks Canada could not secure a Canadian Coast Guard icebreaker to assist with the project.
"This year we are going to move northward and we're going to work west of King William Island, near the Royal Geographical [Society] Islands area," said Marc-André Bernier, a Parks Canada archeologist who is leading the search team.
The underwater vehicle, which is being supplied by the University of Victoria, can move on its own while it detects and maps objects it finds.
Bernier said researchers have also relied on traditional knowledge from Inuit like Louis Kamookak of Gjoa Haven, Nunavut, who said he believes the searchers are on the right track. "We did find some nails and copper sheeting on those islands and Inuit camps, so that's good evidence that the boats are around that place," Kamookak, a historian who has collected Franklin-related anecdotes from elders and ancestors, told CBC News.
Parks Canada will also spend this summer exploring the wreck of HMS Investigator, a ship that was abandoned in 1854 during its search for Franklin's expedition. HMS Investigator and a cache belonging to captain Robert McClure and the graves of three crew members were found in July 2010 in Banks Island's Mercy Bay in the Northwest Territories. Archeologists will further study the Investigator between July 10-25 by diving underwater to capture images of the wreck for the first time.
Researchers will also explore McClure's cache, as well as an ancient Inuit site that has turned up artifacts such as stone tools, animal bones and possible tent foundations. The ship itself is just offshore from the boundaries of Aulavik National Park, while McClure's cache and the ancient Inuit site are both within the park.

I am married, and I am VERY happy with my marriage. My wife trusts me to be a friend to those in need. I will be a good friend whenever you need help. It is simply how I am wired. I have another avatar called MadHatter. I had problems with one of my avatars turning into a cloud so I started over from scratch. They now both work . . . so I guess I wasted some money. I don't know why the problems occurred; the point is they did, and I created another avatar as a result. However, I am the same person. I keep both avators simply because I like them. I like the MadHatter because he is unique. I like Clark because I am and always will be a Beatles fan and tried to create something that looked like a Beatle. I don't think I came close, but I tried. I go by Clark Christianson, but my handle is NeverForgetTheSoldier, and yes, I did spend time in the military . . . more specifically the army. I saw some good things and bad things in the military, but I learned a lot from my experiences. Regardless, you can call me Clark or Mad. I am not "mad," in fact, I am just the opposite. I am a very content guy who loves the journey he is on in this lifetime. If you need a friend I will be there for you. You can count on it. Even if you are not in the military or have ever been in the military, you will be considered my brother or sister here in second life. We all have battle scars and we are all brothers and sisters.

About a year ago, in the second-most successful post in this blog's short history, I outlined a Birder's Map of America. I thought it was pretty good, personally - except there was one glaringly obvious problem with it. I completely swindled you, my dear Beaver State. A question mark, an ignorant statement about a lack of visiting birders, and an all-too-easy cable television reference was all you got from me. I received several complaints about this oversight, which started to nag at me. Could I really have screwed up that map? Well, it's time for me to admit that I did.
By a stroke of complete luck coupled with a slight dose of irony, I found myself at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in your southeastern corner, where I interned for the summer. I have to say, I've never seen so many birders in my life. Not to mention that two months of relatively nonchalant birding and working (a blurred line in some respects) has yielded me 191 species of birds. This all in one county, under "birders don't go here either" on the map. Yeah, yeah, I messed up. It was so far from the truth it could probably just be interpreted as shitty sarcasm.
What makes this place so special? Hell, just about everything. It's a giant waterfowl-laden wetland in the middle of a desert, surrounded by beautiful lava cliffs and sagebrush country. I've peered into Golden Eagle nests, been mobbed by Long-billed Curlews, gotten face-to-face with Common Nighthawks, and had both Long-eared and Short-eared Owls in one binocular view at the same time.
Then there are the vagrant traps, a somewhat alien concept to an easterner like me, where off-course migrants get concentrated in unusually high numbers. I have to admit, finding a Least Flycatcher in my backyard out here was quite a surprise, as was watching a Rose-breasted Grosbeak feeding amongst a flock of Black-headeds. The locally-rare male American Redstart that showed up at Fields Oasis made me stop and appreciate this rather dapper bird, a common migrant in my neck of the woods. And the Cattle Egret I stumbled on out near Benson Pond ended up being a state bird for many Memorial Day visitors.
The only trees for miles around can be a haven for lost passerines. This doesn't happen in the East, because literally everything is forested.
From the Harney Basin it's just a short drive up into the mountains, where Townsend's Solitaires, Black-backed Woodpeckers, and flocks of Red Crossbills can be found. Red Crossbill has been a bit of a nemesis for me, so it was pretty sweet to see a mega-flock of about fifty up in Malheur National Forest (along with around 300 more over the course of my trip).
Oh- and all of this was all just in once county. A few forays into outlying areas, including the beautiful coast, brought my Oregon trip list up to around 230, a pretty satisfying number in my opinion.
I could go on and on - but in essence, Oregon, you've been good to me. And I'm really sorry, despite your excessively low speed limits and bizarre rule about not pumping your own gas. I hope you will look past my blundering oversight and accept my apology. It would mean a lot to me.
How do birders spend their time? It's pretty much different for everyone. But if we are generalizing, this pie chart should be a good breakdown of a birder's free time. Birding makes up a decent chunk of this time, but not all of it, as you will see below. We even manage a decent amount of normal human interaction - that's good news!
After some thinking, we realized just how little time is spent actually looking at birds - we spend much more time looking for them than at them. Of course, everyone is different. Coffee drinkers, for instance, will sacrifice birding time in order to satisfy their debilitating caffeine addiction. People that drive the speed limit or avoid sketchy game lands in the wee hours of the morning will probably not be pulled over by the police for "excessive speeding" or "looking suspicious" (speaking from experience here). People who generally bird alone probably won't laugh much, unless they are crazy. This is meant to be a generalization, after all.
March is arguably the most uneventful month of birding in the state of North Carolina. The only exciting news is usually in the form of returning Tree Swallows and Ospreys while the bulk of the migrants are still a long way off. The gulls and ducks are all leaving (or have already left), and the winter birds have all been seen. The good news is, I will be using this time to build up some new material for this oft-neglected blog.
This lull in bird activity leaves us some extra time on our hands. Freed from the crippling ID pitfalls of worn large white-headed gulls, and predating the influx of Black-throated Blue Warblers and the like, March's meh-ness gives us a chance to think about our own birding. I like to plan things out in advance, so naturally, I decided to look at what sorts of birds I will be able to see this year. I noticed one thing that really, really pissed me off.
The dates of April 29-May 7, when read aloud, conjure up images of Prothonotary Warblers, Veerys (Veeries?), Eastern Whip-poor-wills, and Yellow-breasted Chats. This is peak migration in central NC, when every birder and their brother is out kicking around the local hotspots. Unfortunately, due to NC State University's debilitating schedule, I won't be enjoying much of this migrant free-for-all. Because these are the dates of our final exams. Really. They did this to me.
So while I have an obscene amount of free, birdable time on my hands this March (it's Spring Break right now), I will have next to none come peak migration. My rather impressive North Carolina year list I've compiled thus far will be severely handicapped by my need to maintain a decent GPA. Aside from a few quick ambles down the campus greenway (which luckily can be surprisingly productive), I'll be locked in my dorm room, wishing I was outdoors.
But I ask not for your sympathy. I dream of a day when bird-obsessed college students like me can take their final exams after the bulk of the migrants have moved through. Maybe we can establish a university where birder kids can take their finals in July and March, when no one wants to go birding (at least in my neck of the woods).
We hear a lot about ship-assisted vagrancy these days. "So-and-so bird is crazy, so it must have been carried over on a ship" some birders proclaim with each rarity that visits our continent. This is a big deal - a bird that rode over on a ship would be non-countable, according to the prevailing view. Well, the truth is, there are some birds that hitch rides on ships within our sacred ABA area borders that people are completely ignoring. The effect these birds have on our lists is absolutely detrimental. Hell, I've seen birders count these ferry freeloaders. They count them! It's madness.
We became aware of this sick and twisted phenomenon last weekend, while birding in New Hanover County, North Carolina. Aside from being home to the most populous Wilmington in the United States, it is also home to the mouth of the Cape Fear River, the largest river entirely within North Carolina. There is a ferry that connects one side of the river to the other, running from Fort Fisher across to Southport. But there's one problem. Southport isn't in New Hanover County. It's in Brunswick. Birds (especially gulls and grackles), have a habit of riding the ferry, due in part to the easy supply of bread given to them by children. These freeloaders spend the day riding back and forth across the Cape Fear and across the county line.
Go ahead, look into the eyes of this heartless ship-assisted bastard - but don't you dare count it for your Brunswick or your New Hanover lists.
These birds have probably been border-hopping on this boat for months (especially those grackles). It has reached the point where we can't even tell which side of the river these birds are originally from. Can you count any of these birds? Do they count when you first get on the ferry, but not when you cross the border halfway through the ride? Hell, all the grackles and gulls around both ferry terminals have probably ridden the ferry at some point in their lives. So those don't count either? And how can we be sure that any of the birds within several miles of the terminals didn't ride on that ship? Did the birds even originate in one of the two counties? They may have ferry hopped all the way from - God forbid - South Carolina. I know those Mottled Ducks at the Fort Fisher Aquarium looked awfully guilty.
This first-cycle Herring Gull never made it onto the ship while we were watching - but there's no telling it hasn't landed on the boat in the past.
I can only see one solution to this problem: shut down the Southport ferry, and wait for all the birds that rode it to slowly die off. I'm tired of paying the $5 fee anyway. Or I guess we could just stop worrying about ship-assisted birds and ignore the arbitrary non-countability rule that someone made up long ago... but that's crazy.
Twenty Fourteen was a hell of a year for us. We saw some amazing birds. We made a blog (this one). And now we feel like we have to push out that obligatory end-of-year round up. But, to spare you from reading a long list of notable sightings (and I'm sure other bird bloggers saw better stuff than us), we decided to review some things we learned in 2014.
This may sound like something two teenagers would remember. But, for some bizarre reason, we decided to only pack about 800 calories worth of food per day for our Smoky Mountains birding/backpacking trip. We felt like we were starving, eating only crackers and tuna each day. I think the lack of food may have been the cause of the possible-hallucination Ghost of the Horseman sighting. But that's another story. At least we got Ruffed Grouse.
Basically what we learned: Don't eat bad Mexican food the night before a Pelagic...even if Gidget's is closed. Though we didn't get sick, pre-pelagic sketchy Mexican food (from a place named "La Fogata") is never a good idea. Luckily, the Dramamine saved the particularly wavy day.
Things get stolen. While searching for Black-throated Green Warblers in the Uwharrie Mountains, Lucas made the mistake of leaving his headlamp on the counter in a campground bathroom while he took a shower. The shower was running (and he was singing), so he couldn't hear the sound of it being stolen by people with the confederate battle flag taped to the front of their truck. We just assumed they were part of the Confederate Army. Oh, the South.
Just because it looks weak does not mean you need to add packets of instant coffee. However, this stuff is the cure-all for the mid-afternoon big day lull. It's like crack (we assume). Once we got over the gritty consistency and the burning sensation, the coffee really wasn't that bad. One moment we were falling asleep on our feet but after a few gulps of cold brew we were singing at the top of our lungs and picking out Loggerhead Shrikes on power lines while flying by at 60 miles per hour.
We are looking forward to many more stories and learning experiences over this coming year - it's half the fun of birding. So here's to a great, bird-filled 2015. And here's to more crazy situations that only really happen to birders. We've already had one ridiculous adventure....
This frosty little Redpoll was a very welcome visitor to the niger seeds today: on inspection he seems to have a silver-coloured ring on his left leg....
My favourite patch walk is from Blofield Heath, past Hemblington Hall and the Alpaca Farm, back past Dell Corner then along High Noon Lane, returning via Cutton's Corner: this is around 6 miles. I don't expect to see much at this time of year, but there's usually something: today it was a cute little Weasel, a couple of very vocal Egyptian Geese, several Yellowhammers and a flock of Fieldfares.....
Back home! But a week with Mum-in-Law in Maidenhead was, as always, enlivened by Ring-necked & Alexandrine Parakeets on the Boulter's Lock Eyots, as well as Red Kites & Grey Wagtails aplenty!
A wonderful couple of hours at Strumpshaw, in the company of possibly the three best bird photographers in the Yare Valley: Mark, Norman & Brian, as well as the two lovely Lizzies!
Fabulous views of perhaps five Bitterns as well as a whisp of 11 Snipe and the ever-vigilant Buckenham Peregrines....
Martin (my oldest friend and best birder I know!) spent a coffee-fueled day on the north coast, starting with Bramblings at Choseley, moving to Titchwell for Spotted Redshank, Twite and Red-crested Pochard. A large mixed flock of waders was feeding on Razor Clams on the beach: this included Knot, Sanderling & Turnstones. The drive eastwards for lattes at Cley produced very welcome Waxwing & Bullfinch at Burnham Norton, while a hike to Gramborough Hill was virtually birdless.
A short-ish walk around Strumpshaw (and Ranworth) in the excellent company of Sue S was surprisingly productive! Not one, but FOUR otters fishing together by the sluices. Other birds included a Bittern and at least six Great Spotted Woodpeckers, including three together, as well as two drake Goosanders at Ranworth.
As I was driving home, I saw a Buzzard perched close to Bullace Bush Road: a binocular view (before I had to respond to the hooting of the traffic jam I'd caused behind me!) revealed it to be a frosty Rough-legged Buzzard!
An eight mile walk from Buckenham to Cantley and back provided distant (but welcome) views of flocks of Whitefronts, Taiga Bean Geese and Golden Plover. Less welcome was an ignorant sh*t holding court on the embankment at Cantley, who was extraordinarily rude when I tried to make polite conversation.....
As I was preparing aubergines parmagiana, I glanced out of the kitchen window to see this beautiful Brambling on the seeds! Pictures taken through misty kitchen windows are never great, but you get the idea... Let's hope he sticks around!
Even over the sound of Roy Wood on the radio wishing it could be Christmas every day, I heard the distinctive yelping of a massive flock (300+) of Pink-footed Geese flying west over the house. I grabbed my camera and bins and rushed out in my dressing gown: joining the Pinks from the north was a flock of about 20 Bean Geese. By the time I took a single photo, the birds were disappearing in the distance....
Camera lens, that is! Today I saw some terrific birds at Strumpshaw / Buckenham, but everything was at the limits of my optics: Bitterns (4) Sparrowhawks (2) Buzzards (3) ..... even the more expected species such as Mistle Thrush and Bearded Tit were at the very edge of my equipment / abilities. Still: here are a few pictures, as well as the ingredients for a fine game pie! (There were nine Hares altogether!)

"Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected." ~ Steve Jobs.
We have all seen the Apple phenomenon. The design, the approach, the marketing and the products have an aesthetic and appeal that draws admiration. The company and brand is truly remarkable.
So when my daughter decided to accept an offer to work for Apple, in finance, at their Cupertino headquarters I got to see through her eyes the reality of the Apple Experience. A picture tells a thousand words:
There's work and there's your life's work. The kind of work that has your fingerprints all over it. The kind of work that you'd never compromise on. That you'd sacrifice a weekend for. You can do that kind of work at Apple. People don't come here to play it safe.

Many people think that since Abbas, Olmert and even Bush are relatively weak, the dangers of their meetings and declarations are negligible. This is a very dangerous way to think. Weak leaders are in the wobbly position to grab at any straw to enhance their perception abroad and at home. Olmert has been running on the general population's apathy since the Lebanon War. He is obviously trying to cook up something big. See this piece on Arutz-7. We really must come together to forcefully explain the catastrophe that is imminent, if Israel is to again make concessions of land and security on the naive hopes of a penitent Arab population.
However, there is a silver lining. Annapolis seems to have finally awoken the sleeping giant that is the religious-nationalistic community, as evidenced by Rabbi Rosen's and Rabbi Dov Lior's migration towards support for אצ"ל- and לח"י-type activity. "It is not always necessary to be good boys..." It is still vague, but a change is occurring.
The Israeli government must be made to understand that they have no authority to take more chances on the tab of Jewish lives.
I don't think Rav Rosen is promoting terror, I think he is saying that resistance to the government plans to uproot settlements has to be take a more serious coloration than the 'hug and tears' of Gush Katif. He is using rhetoric that shows how serious these issues are.I can see that my post was not clear.
Let me clarify that I do not promote terror. Perhaps לח"י and אצ"ל language is misplaced. What I mean (and think they mean) is that there has to be strong opposition to the government's plans, protests, and a willingness to remain in places the Israeli government abandons, and for brave people to defend themselves there. I think this is the לח"י and אצ"ל spirit.
I am not sure how realistic these ideas are, but the fact that they are discussed will certainly give the government reason to stop and think; no longer can they expect people to follow meekly their destructive orders.

I really loved Eitan Arom’s cover story (“L.A.’s Boldest Plan Ever to Help the Homeless,” Oct. 14) with its beautiful depiction of “Faces of Homelessness” as well as the strong support of Measure HHH. Thanks for reaching out to remarkable professionals in our industry (Amy, Dora and Tanya) to get a fair perspective on the crisis and solutions needed to end homelessness.
I was especially touched by the connection to Sukkot. Sukkot has forever been my favorite holiday of the year in part because of its celebration outdoors (much like why I loved celebrating the second day of Rosh Hashanah with Neshuva!), the symbolism of a wandering people living in such a fragile structure, and the tradition of inviting people (real and biblical) into the sukkah. I’ve always felt the need to raise greater awareness about housing issues during this holiday, and so for many years, I’ve made my sukkah a space for staff meetings, or to talk with guests about what we can all do to support more housing. So reading Eitan’s piece connecting Sukkot and strategies to end homelessness was powerful.
After three years of failed efforts in their pledge to help the homeless, the Los Angeles City Council, with Mayor Eric Garcetti in the lead, introduced Proposition HHH as their ticket to re-election. Housing the homeless and hope have a different meaning when less than 25 percent ($250 million) is earmarked for homeless housing. With a $2 billion payback after the 10-year program is completed, it spells a giveaway to the contractors involved in the low-cost housing project, which in L.A. means unaffordable to most. In the meantime, there will be a doubling of the homeless population in L.A. Many refuse a structured life, especially the young enjoying their rootlessness on Venice Beach.
What is needed now is food sufficiency, health care, toilets and showers for the 1,000 in Venice, the 28,000 in L.A. and the 50,000 in L.A. County in an effort that goes beyond the county. Homelessness is a national tragedy and must be dealt with locally, in Sacramento and in Washington, D.C. Instead of sukkahs, tent cities that can be quickly built are needed for shelter on the order of the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s. With the new enterprises come responsibility to the new communities and the payback of the homeless.
Dennis Prager calls San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s actions a “mockery of every American soldier, sailor and Marine who fought for, let alone died for, that flag” (“Which Do You Love More: Football or America?” Oct. 14). Whatever one thinks of Kaepernick, the men and women of the United States military have not fought or died for a piece of cloth, but for the very freedoms his protests epitomize.
Why is it that often when conservatives challenge those who protest aspects of American life, they accuse the protesters — in this case 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and author Ta-Nehisi Coates — of “mockery of every American soldier, sailor and Marine who fought for, let alone died for, that flag.”
The flag is just a symbol, and I am sure it means different things to different Americans. I think the very word “America” means different things to different Americans.
I challenge a lot of things about “America,” but I am not mocking anyone who fought (or died) in an American conflict. I do challenge some of the leaders of America and some of the decisions they made and their motives therefore, which took us to wars where Americans died.
I read Danielle Berrin’s article “When a Rabbi Fails” (Oct. 7), in which she described her disappointment when she recently learned of the “fall from grace” of her former congregational rabbi in Miami.
In her article, Berrin said she wrestled with the question, “Is it reasonable to expect that our spiritual leaders should behave better than we do?” I say, “Yes, it is!”
One of my favorite things to do is write children’s songs. Over the years, I have written lots of innocuous little ditties for kids as a way of teaching them about Jewish holidays and rituals, ethics and values, and how to treat families and friends. Long ago, when I was just starting out as a teacher in religious school, I realized that singing a song was an easy and relatively painless way to learn important Jewish lessons about life. So I wrote songs about everything I could think of — from “Hands Hold the Torah Way Up High,” to “Shabbat Shalom Comes to Our Home,” to “Kibbutz is Not the Last Car on a Railroad Train.” Kids seemed to like them, and in the process of singing, they learned some of the most important lessons about Jewish life.
Three thousand years ago, Moses had pretty much the same idea. As he led that bedraggled band of ex-slaves out of 400 years of Egyptian bondage, he sang them across the sea of reeds to quell their fears, bolster their spirits and teach them that what this invisible God of the Hebrews demanded perhaps more than anything else was that people be free. Moses’ “Song of the Sea” became the first number-one hit song in Jewish history, and we still sing some of its lyrics at every single service in the form of the “Mi Kamocha.”
Just as he began this 40-year desert drama by writing a song for his people, he sings his “Farewell Lament” to signal the end of their wandering and teach them about God and the challenge of their collective destiny once again. Moses seems to have written Ha’azinu as a way of reminding the generation about to enter the Promised Land of promises broken and promises kept.
He sings of the promises they broke along the way during their desert years — how, in spite of the fact that God created them, allowed them to endure through all the hardships of slavery, and prepared a precious inheritance for Israel in the future, they continually turned away to follow false idols and pagan “no-gods.” Moses sings to remind them of the remarkable redemption they personally experienced under God’s protective wing (“like an eagle who rouses his nestlings, gliding down to his young”) and to warn them of the promises they will inevitably break in years to come.
When he begins the song by calling on heaven and earth to hear the words of his song, his audience can’t help but be reminded that only a portion ago, he called on the same heaven and earth to witness perhaps the central spiritual challenge of the entire Torah: that good and evil, life and death, blessing and curse dangle balanced forever before the eyes of the entire Jewish people, and the choice is up to them.
Ha’azinu is a musical, poetic ethical will from Moses to his children. Like a loving parent whose child is about to go off to college or to live on her own, Moses gives the Children of Israel his final words of advice so that they will remember when he is gone all the values, ethics and morals that he has tried to teach them during his lifetime.
Perhaps we can all learn from the example of Moses this week. I was only 4 when my first father died. I know how grateful I would have been if he had left a written record of his thoughts and dreams, ideals and moral teachings for me to read and cherish as I grew. It’s not too late to do the same for your children. Take the time to write down the values you most want to pass on to them and their children. It will be the most priceless gift you could ever give.
Steven Carr Reuben is senior rabbi of Kehillat Israel, the Reconstructionist Congregation of Pacific Palisades.
This recipe originally appeared in the summer 2016 issue of our Byachad Magazine. You can read the full issue here.
In 2004, Johnny Stern, a Brazilian born immigrant who moved to Israel with his family at the age of 17, made the bold decision to open his own winery, Stern Winery. He realized his true calling lay with the vines of his winery, located in Kibbutz Tuval, a picturesque community in the hills of the Western Galilee. Before realizing this dream, however, he lived a dual life for nearly six years: as a sales manager for a company manufacturing industrial adhesives, machinery oil, and metal treatments, and as an artisanal wine producer in Israel’s budding boutique wine industry.
My sister woke me from my sleep at 4AM in New York on Sunday morning with a phone call from Johannesburg. I was so shocked by what she said I wept after she had hung up. Then I rang my parents in the UK as I had been requested to do, to tell them what was happening. My sister’s eldest son K had been in a car crash, he had been cut from the wreckage and flown to hospital by air ambulance, the trauma specialists were working to stabilize his condition and scanning his brain for signs of brain damage. Two of K’s best friends were already dead.
Now on Monday It does appear that K will live and hopefully make a full recovery. But obviously it is still a worrying time for all of us. Especially for my Sister and Brother in Law. They really thought they had lost him when there appeared to be no record of him at any of the hospitals. He had arrived in Baragwanath – Soweto General, the biggest hospital in the world, as an unidentified male, so searches for him showed up nothing.
But given the circumstances we are lucky, when I think of the families of the two dearly loved friends who have died, it makes me weep all over again.
PPS ……… I wrote this two weeks back but did not post it till now ……….. because only now have I finally managed to speak to K on Skype myself ………. so now I really do believe … because of the evidence of my own eyes …. that he is going to be fully OK. But of course the loss of his two wonderful friends remains desperately, desperately sad for him, and for all of us, but the pain and sadness of their parents and families I can only begin to imagine.

The ninth installment in the Filmworks series on Tzadik in the haunting soundtrack to "Trembling Before G-D", a "documentary about gay Hasidim and Orthodox Jews who 'come out' as gays and lesbians and the ways in which they negotiate their sexuality and identity in religious communities." (From the liner notes by director Sandi Simcha Dubowski). Zorn, whose exploration of the many aspects and facets of Jewish identity in Masada and a lifelong championing of outsiders in many of his other projects, makes him uniquely suited to score the film.
However, this is yet another album featuring the Masada songs played by yet another band, and while the results are certainly impressive, they are by no means essential to a record collection. Certainly Filmworks VIII, Bar Kokhba or Circle Maker are better discs to get for the Masada tunes being played by small ensembles, but that being said, this is a beautiful album.
Like Filmworks VIII, the act of scoring a film seems to focus these songs, imbuing them with a certain kind of power that the otherwise wonderful Circle Maker lacks. Circle Maker is, strangely enough, the only Masada song album which isn't a sound track at all.
While I was never a big fan of the clarinet/organ duets on Bar Kokhaba, some extra element makes them work here. While John Medeski's right hand lines flew around with Chris Speed's clarinet lines on Bar Kokhba, Jamie Saft takes a more laid back approach, adding dark colors and pulses to the clarinet; the lower register of Saft's organ is particularly powerful and hypnotic.

I have been so excited to have this conversation with my friend Tsh Oxenreider. As I followed along with her family as they traveled the world last year, I could not wait to hear more and read her book At Home In The World. Amazing author, brilliant woman, faithful friend. You're going to adore her, her brain, her story.
In the early 1950s Avions Maurice Brochet designed and built lightweight sporting aircraft. In addition to production versions, some were intended also for amateur construction. These included the M.B.70, M.B.71, M.B.80, M.B.100,and M.B.101.
They laughed at Roberto Valdez and then ignored him. But when a dark-skinned man was holed up in a shack with a gun, they sent the part-time town constable to deal with the problem -- and made sure he had no choice but to gun the fugitive down. Trouble was, Valdez killed an innocent man. And when he asked for justice -- and some money for the dead man's woman -- they beat Valdez and tied him to a cross. They were still laughing when Valdez came back. And then they began to die...
How to use Instagram to drive sales – Instagram is one of the best social media platforms to build relationships and trust with your audience and this is often one of the first steps of converting your followers into buyers and getting them to click over to your shop/blog/website
Whereas Twitter is great for community and Pinterest is great for driving traffic, Instagram is great for building trust with your audience.
You need to have a good bio which indicates to the audience that you are there to provide them a transformation / solution with something they struggle with. Or you can also use your bio to let people know exactly who you are and what you do. Everything in your bio from your profile picture to your description should be on brand and should appeal to your target audience.
For example, since the bio is the only part of Instagram where you can have a clickable link it is important to utilize this feature in a strategic way.
Tell your followers to click the link to receive 10% off or click the link to see more colours. It has been shown that if you TELL people to do something they are more likely to do it. So don’t hesitate and tell them to “grab” this or “click” that! In Instabuzzing we go over CTA exercises that help you come up with a few that work for you!
You can sell directly to your customers on Instagram since it is such a highly visual platform. Therefore, your potential customers can see your product, so the key is to take good photos of your products! You can take a great product and not take a good image – blurry, too dark, not sharp – and really lower the potential of buyers wanting to buy! In Instabuzzing we dedicate one whole module to Visual Strategy where we cover photography basics and provide other actionable strategies to make your feed cohesive and consistent.
If you are selling a higher price product, it’s always great to utilize Instagram as a step in your selling process. What do I mean by that? Instead of selling directly – provide lots of value along with your Instagram posts and ask them to click the link in your bio to grab a freebie. This way you get them on your mailing list where you can build trust and authority and eventually pitch your higher priced product/service to them!
Another way to utilize Instagram to drive sales is to offer special sales discounts or coupons to your Instagram followers exclusive to Instagram. If people feel that by joining your Instagram they will remain up to date on all these exclusive offers and discounts then they’ll want to follow so not to miss them. The more they keep up and see your Instagram posts the more they are likely to buy!
If people can’t see what your Instagram account is selling, or what your feed looks like right off the bat – then there is no incentive to give you a follow or buy from you. By the time you see their request to follow you and you approve, they can very much land on another profile which is public and has similar content/products/services as yours, therefore, increasing the likelihood they will follow and buy from the other profile than yours!
Make sure your business name is in your handle and your handle is the same across all social media platforms including Instagram. Then you need to go engage with your potential clients. You can’t just post and disappear – interact!! With interaction the likelihood of your potential clients following you goes up and so the likelihood of them buying from you goes up.

So, almost everyone I know, is having, or has had in the past two years, babies. And good on ’em. If *families* are you thing, you should go for it. What this means for me is taking lots photos of the little buggers when I’m back in Melbourne-town.
To my surprise though, I don’t hate it :) even though on my most recent trip (a week ago) the babies seemed to hate me; nothing like walking into a room and seeing an excited child start crying at the mere sight of you (*note to self: get a haircut — SNAP! I had my annual haircut yesterday!)
Anyways, here are a few pics I took of babies on this tour downunder. In the firing line: Wesley, Gilbert, and Alannah.
It is not as if the United States is at war with North Korea again, but real peace has never been made in the political sense. Particularly since the most recent round of nuclear weapons testing in North Korea, sanctions have been stressed and new ideas for making peace have been brought forth. It seems like the end goal is to disarm the country and restore fruitful economic sanctions.
Kim Jong Un, the leader of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (aka North Korea, or the DPRK), and President Trump met at a conference with each other in Singapore and since, peace negotiations have been moving along at their own pace. The American people expected no less and it is good to know that the wheels have been set in motion. After ominous and frequent nuclear tests in North Korea made headlines, Americans became quite unsettled.
As it turns out, both the DPRK and the U.S. have needed to settle disputes for some time now and it serves both nations to make peace. President Trump calls for the denuclearization of North Korea, but it is unclear as of today if both sides agree to the definition and extent of “denuclearization”.
Though negotiations have begun there is not yet a peace treaty between the United States and North Korea, it is sorely needed. The thing is that a treaty would require the Senate to agree at a level of two thirds of the chamber. What is the likelihood of this happening? It seems to be good given the push from the American people and the intense scrutiny Trump is under at this time.
Denuclearization is the precedent to such a treaty and that means on the part of North Korea, not America. Considering that the United States is the biggest of the superpowers, it leads as the one to propose the terms of the treaty. Talks continue toward an agreement.
Naturally, the DPRK is pushing for the U.S. to remove economic sanctions. They propose that this should happen expediently since they have frozen nuclear and missile tests per the request of President Trump. North Korea also recently dismantled one of the nuclear sites in the country. They have also offered to repatriate the remains of American soldiers who died in the Korean War.
President Trump, on other hand, is dissatisfied with these efforts and believes it is all moving too slowly. The talks are going slow, according to sources, but the Trump administration regards the nuclear freeze as a good move on the part of North Korea.
The meeting in Singapore was just the beginning and the largest point stressed was to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula”. It has indeed begun but, since the United States and North Korea have been at war since the year of 1950, the work will take some time. The nuclear threat has also kept sanctions against the country quite heavy over the years, hence their dissatisfaction.
There is a strong possibility that economic trade between the countries could be a boon for both economies and will clearly play a role in the discussions.

This Assyrian stone relief from the northwestern palace at Nimrud shows two nearly assimetrical carved figures of King Ashurnasirpal II facing a stylized sacred tree and flanked by protective deities. The king is in his role as high priest and he is lifting his hand in worship towards a winged disk where the god Ashur resides. Ashur is the supreme national god of Assyria (Ashur). The sacred tree is related to the palmette symbol and represents the fertility of the Earth, especially the land of Ashur. The two protective deities are called �Apkalle�. They have the horned cap of divinity and hold a cone in the raised hand (to provide magical protection) and a bucket in the left.

Among the most important resources of a school are the people of the school community. There is no doubt that students benefit from the assistance provided of volunteers. A love for children combined with patience, understanding and some free time are the only requirements necessary to become a volunteer. The time commitment varies according to the individual volunteer and position. Volunteers are needed to assist in specific ways in the classrooms, with general school events, special projects and to sit on school council.
A form for volunteer parents at Banded Peak is sent home at the beginning of the year. We would be grateful for your help. If you are aware of community members who do not have children attending our school but who have some time and/or special talents/interest to share with our students, please invite them to contact us – their support and involvement would be very welcome.
To maintain the integrity of the learning environment in the classroom, we would like to request that parents volunteering in the classrooms not bring pre-school children.
Volunteers are asked to sign in at the office and pick up a volunteer badge to be worn while in the school.
In addition, all parents/community members interested in volunteering at Banded Peak are required to complete and submit a vulnerable sector check from the RCMP. Letters and information are provided to all parents at the beginning of the school year and are available through the school office.

5Therefore, since we are justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, 2through whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. 3And not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, 4and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, 5and hope does not disappoint us, because Gods love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us.
6For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. 7Indeed, rarely will anyone die for a righteous personthough perhaps for a good person someone might actually dare to die. 8But God proves his love for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us. 9Much more surely then, now that we have been justified by his blood, will we be saved through him from the wrath of God. 10For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more surely, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life. 11But more than that, we even boast in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. 12Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death came through sin, and so death spread to all because all have sinned 13sin was indeed in the world before the law, but sin is not reckoned when there is no law. 14Yet death exercised dominion from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sins were not like the transgression of Adam, who is a type of the one who was to come.

If you feel passionate about something, that is almost always an indication that you are called to that for God gives us a passion for something we are likely gifted in.

Jerusalem Map Winsor & Newton Kids Superhero Bible Verse, Kids Scripture Art, DIGITAL,YOU PRINT, Kids Superhero Art, Christian Scripture Art, Kids Christian Art,Bible Art Some have mistakenly equated NT prophecy with preaching, but Paul declares that all prophecy is based on a revelation (1 Cor. 14:30; cf. 1 Cor. 13:2). The NT’s use of the noun “revelation” or the verb “to reveal” actually reflects a wide range of meaning and need not be taken as referring to the sort of authoritative revelation that would undermine the finality of the canon. Rather, the apostle likely has in view the sort of divine disclosure or unveiling in which the Spirit makes known something previously hidden (e.g., Matt. 11:27; 16:17; 1 Cor. 2:10; Gal. 1:6; Eph. 1:17; Phil. 3:15). Thus, prophecy is not based on a hunch, supposition, inference, educated guess, or even sanctified wisdom. Prophecy is the human report of a divine revelation. This is what distinguishes prophecy from teaching. Teaching is always grounded in an inspired text of Scripture. Prophecy, on the other hand, is always based on a spontaneous revelation. Thus Paul clearly distinguishes between coming to the corporate meeting of the church with a “word of instruction” and coming with a “revelation” (1 Cor. 14:26). 56 people like this.

They come from Satan and the only way a Christian would hear or see these thing would be if it were a form of attack, not a gift. From experience, Spiritual attacks are scary stuff and not a gift at all! These things usually happen to discourage the believer from following the faith and lead them astray…from the path God wishes for them. I have known them to occur people who have been involved in things of the occult and they were attacked as they found their faith. Satan didn’t want them to go to God! Other times, Ministers and those who are currently being used by God for something, have been attacked spiritually in such ways. However Spiritual attack can come in many forms, not just the supernatural scary stuff. In my case, as I learn how to repel one type of attack, Satan hits me the next time with something stronger and unfamilar. He is not very nice as I am sure you know and will try anything to keep us from full filling Gods plan.

See this image Product MARKET shirley August 6, 2013 at 6:28 pm Apostle: The title apostle comes from the Greek word apostolos which means "a messenger, one sent forth with orders".[21] It refers to one who has been delegated authority by another in a foreign land.[22] Apostles were the first leaders of the Church; they were commissioned by Jesus to initiate and direct the preaching of the gospel. While many Christians agree that the title of apostle is reserved for those among the first generation of Christians, many Christian denominations continue in one way or another to recognize a continuing apostolic ministry. Many churches, such as the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Churches, believe in the doctrine of apostolic succession, which holds that properly ordained bishops are the successors to the apostles. Other Christian groups, such as classical Pentecostals, consider the role of a missionary to be fulfilling an apostolic ministry.[23] There are some Christians, however, who advocate restoring the Fivefold ministry, including the formal recognition of the office of apostle. Others would say that the office no longer exists.[24] Religious All Occasion Cards Formulas For SuccessTeachablenessWisdom, Source Of HumanDecisions, Guiding Principles OfPromises To Stand onAge Differences In RelationshipsAsking For HelpGod Answers PrayerGod Gives WisdomGod Giving FreelyTeaching WisdomTime ManagementCareer SuccessPrayer, And God's Will lynda March 24, 2015 at 3:59 pm Felix Bvuta Item #: 362067 Healing CancerGod's Love In ChristEverlastingGivingGod Giving His SonLoveCoolAtonementAccepting ChristBecoming A ChristianAmbassadorsBeing A Perfect ChristianAwesome GodBeing A LightBeing In LoveBaby JesusActs of KindnessBeing A PilgrimComfortingBeing Born AgainFaith, As Basis Of SalvationEternal SecurityOnce Saved Always SavedChild sacrificeJesus Role In SalvationPlaitingChrist's Relationship To GodHeart, DivineFall Of Man, Consequences OfKnowing I Am SavedUnion With Christ, Nature OfAdam, Descendants Unlock Your Education 17.190.38 Aunt/Daughter HomeMuseumsArtistsFairsShowsAuctionsGalleriesMagazine Jose L.

[Title: “I Was a Teenage Werewolf.”] Of London! –You are not drinking a pina colada at Trader Vic’s, young man, you’re just not old enough.

Bonanza is a TV western drama that aired on NBC from 1959 to 1973. At 430 episodes, it is the second longest-running western drama series, behind Gunsmoke (CBS, 1955-1975; 635 episodes). The show focused on the Cartwright family: widowed rancher and patriarch Ben Cartwright (Lorne Greene) and his three sons, each by a different wife: Adam (Pernell Roberts), Hoss (Dan Blocker), and Little Joe (Michael Landon). Bonanza was at the vanguard of American television’s conversion to color programs, and though the characters were beloved and iconic, they were also the source of many parodies, often pointing out that the father and eldest sons appeared to be very nearly the same age (Greene was just 15 years older than both Roberts and Blocker).
A possible reference to the 1971 film (and its subsequent novelization) Summer of ’42, which were both written by Herman Raucher, based on his memoirs. It’s the story of a teenage boy summering on Nantucket Island; he falls for a young woman whose husband is off fighting World War II.
Joan Collins is an actress who is best known for her role as Alexis Morrell Carrington Colby Dexter Rowan on the TV prime time soap opera Dynasty, which aired from 1981-1989.

Another riff on “Werewolves of London” (see previous note). Fae Smith (1905-1969) also worked as a hair stylist on such Hollywood classics as The Ten Commandments (1956), The Searchers (1956), and How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1967).

In December 1996, the Oakland, California, school board voted unanimously to recognize “Ebonics,” or the dialect of English used by many African-Americans, as the primary language of its black students. The vote came as part of an effort to help black students transition to more universally accepted forms of English by having teachers study Ebonics. Critics of the board’s decision denounced it as political correctness run amok; the board defended its actions by pointing out the high failure rates among black students in public schools.
Goosebumps was a popular series of scary children’s books in the mid- to late 1990s; written by R.L. Stine, the books came out at a rate of about one a month, ensuring an endless supply for their fans. However, a number of parents and educators have tried to remove them from school libraries, arguing that the books were nothing but “junk reading” that did little to foster a true appreciation for literature in their young readers.
A reference to the famous Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Durán boxing match that took place on November 25, 1980, in New Orleans. The two had fought five months earlier in Montreal, with Leonard defending his welterweight title, and Durán had won in a unanimous decision. But in the intervening months, Durán had allowed his weight to balloon, and he unfortunately had eaten a heavy meal before the bout. In the eighth round, Durán simply quit, turning his back on Leonard and saying, "No mas" ("No more"). Durán blamed stomach cramps for his decision to forfeit the match and the title to Leonard, but the boxing world was widely shocked and disappointed by his actions. (Thanks to Doug Lewis for this reference.)
Dwarf tossing is a sport popular in England and in former British colonies such as Canada and Australia, in which contestants compete to see how far they can throw a dwarf, or little person. A number of attempts have been made to ban the sport in recent years—some successful, some not—over the objections of the dwarves themselves, who see it as an attempt to take away their livelihood.
Highway to Heaven was a television series that aired from 1984-1989. It starred Michael Landon as an angel sent back to earth to help people with their personal problems.
In 1976, Michael Landon wrote, directed, and starred in the made-for-TV movie The Loneliest Runner. Based on Landon’s own dysfunctional upbringing, it’s the bizarrely ironic story of an adolescent boy who wets the bed, and whose mother hangs the wet sheets out his window for all to see, as a form of punishment. He runs home from school each day to take the sheets down before his friends can see them, which sparks an interest in track and field sports. Cut to ten years later, and the boy is now a gold medal-winning Olympic marathon runner, who thanks his mother for his success.
A take on an old advertising jingle: “You get a lot of dirt with children/You get a lot of clean with Tide." (Thanks to Lori Barnes for finding a clip of this commercial online.)
On July 26, 1996, a security guard at the Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, noticed a suspicious backpack near a sound tower during a concert. The guard, a man named Richard Jewell, alerted police and helped try to evacuate the area. When the bomb inside the backpack went off, one person died and more than a hundred others were injured. Days later, the FBI leaked information that it considered Jewell a suspect. Jewell was hounded by law enforcement and reporters for nearly three months before he was cleared of suspicion; he later sued and settled with a number of media organizations. In May 2003, white supremacist Eric Rudolph was arrested and charged with the bombing. Jewell died four years later at the age of 44; he had severe heart disease, kidney disease, and diabetes.

Bovine growth hormone, or bovine somatotropin, is a hormone that some dairy farmers give to their cows in order to boost milk production. Opponents of the practice argue that it poses health risks to people who drink the milk, including higher incidence of cancer; proponents claim it can help create more food to supply an ever-growing global population. The use of BGH is legal in America, but Canada and Europe have banned it, along with most other bioengineered foods.
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, popularly known as the Mormons, is a church based in Salt Lake City, Utah, boasting more than 9 million members.

The macabre details of the crime ensured sensational media coverage, but despite its high profile and intensive investigation, the case was never solved.

The origin of this often-used quip is a hotly debated topic online, with some claiming the phrase “Mrs. Burke, I thought you were Dale!” comes from an Ivory Soap commercial and others claiming it is from a Grape-Nuts commercial. The definitive Official MST3K FAQ explains it thusly: “Actually, these references are all a mistake by Best Brains. Here's the whole story. Back in the 1970s, there was a series of commercials for Ivory dishwashing liquid, in which mothers were mistaken for their daughters—because the mom used Ivory and so her hands were young-looking. At around the same time, there was also a commercial for Grape Nuts, in which a teenage boy mistakes teenage girl Dale's mother for Dale and utters the deathless line: ‘I thought you were Dale!’ Best Brains only vaguely remembered these two commercials, and apparently mixed them up in their minds. There were apparently never any Ivory Liquid commercials in which a character said ‘I thought you were Dale!’ And the Grape Nuts commercial in which that line was spoken had nothing to do with hands. So basically they goofed. But the writers thought they were making a reference to the Ivory Liquid commercials.”

A former entertainment columnist, never a performer himself, Sullivan was notably lacking in charisma and stage presence, and along with poor posture (“What the hell is wrong with his neck?” was a common question), he had a retinue of stilted and hackneyed phrases he used to promote or introduce acts.

J. Edgar Hoover (1895-1972) was the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation from 1924 until his death. His focus on anti-communism after World War II led him to virtually ignore the Mafia until the mid-1950s. He was known for his loathing of “subversives” of any stripe and launched notorious investigations of Martin Luther King Jr. and John Lennon. He was criticized for turning the FBI into a secret police force, amassing information that allowed him to intimidate sitting presidents. However, he also built the FBI into a professional, modernized, and effective crime-fighting force. Rumors of homosexuality dogged Hoover all his life, and in 1993 author Anthony Summers claimed he was a cross dresser, an image that quickly caught on in the popular imagination.

Oliver Wendell Douglas (played by Eddie Albert) was the main character on the show, the hotshot New York City attorney who yearns for a quiet country life. Kimball was the earnest but scatterbrained county agent in the backwards farming community of Hooterville, and everything he said spiraled into a feedback loop of qualifiers and corrections until finally he completely lost track of what he was saying.

Kennedy in Dallas, Texas (unless you think he didn’t, but I’d have to be crazy to get into that here). Two days later, Oswald was being transferred from his cell to an interrogation room in the Dallas jail when he was shot and killed by local nightclub owner Jack Ruby. Oswald was handcuffed to Dallas Police detective Jim Leavelle, who was dressed in a tan suit and matching Resistol cowboy hat.

trauma that results in hospital admis- sion-are caused by crying," he said.) Les- ter, however, believes that some afflicted infants may be at risk of developing behav- ioral problems as children, in part because colic affects the way parents interact with them as babies. "Colic threatens to cause problems in the child's ability to form re- lationships, because the child doesn't learn behavioral regulation and develops prob- lems with impulse control," Lester said. "It starts out with crying, and then, when the child is older, he doesn't control his emo- tions very well." In his book 'Why Is My Baby Crying? The Parent's Survival Guide for Coping with Crying Problems and Colic" (2005), Lester writes, "Despite what many well-meaning pediatricians tell parents, colic is not a harmless condition. Our research-as well as plenty of oth- ers'-has shown that these babies are more likely to have difficult temperaments and to experience feeding and sleeping problems. . . . They can go on to have be- havior issues in preschool and problems later on in school with attention/hyperac- tivity, sensory integration, and emotional .. " reactIvIty. There have been few long-range studies of colicky infants; the most sub- stantial data in support of Lester' s claims come from the Finnish Family Compe- tence Study Project, by researchers at the University of Turku, in Finland. Begin- ning in 1986, the researchers studied firstborn children from three months to three years, using information taken 1 from questionnaires completed by their parents and public-health nurses. Three hundred and thirty-eight infants suf- fering from colic were compared with eight hundred and sixty-six infants who did not have the condition. The re- searchers analyzed the infants' interac- tions within their families, the parents' reported levels of satisfaction with their daily routines, child-care arrangements, and the children's behavior and develop- ment. The parents of previously colicky infants were found to be more dissatis- fied with family life and the amount of time they had for both leisure and shared activities than were the parents of chil- dren who had not had colic. Mothers regarded the fathers' contributions to the household as less adequate compared with the non-colic group, and their children, at the age of three, were more likely to sleep in their parents' bedroom. Moreover, the three-year-olds in the colic group had significantly greater difficulty falling asleep and more fre- quent temper tantrums. The Finnish re- searchers concluded that the children's problems were likely related to behaviors that began during the period when the infant had colic and were not the result of the colic itself: "In agreement with previous studies, sleeping disorders were more frequent in the children who had been colicky as infants," the researchers wrote in 1995. "These sleeping patterns may suggest that there are problems as far as separa- '7s this your first time with an undercover cop?" tion from the parents is concerned or difficulties in setting limits. Temper tantrums are normal reactions when the wishes of a child are not fulfilled. Some behavior, however, has to be limited. The more frequent temper tantrums in the colic group may be because of cer- tain personality characteristics resulting in more resistance to imposition oflim- its, and/or they may refer to inconsis- tency or helplessness in managing the situations by the parents." As Lester put it, "The parent must attend to the needs of the baby and also help the baby learn self-limits and control." Because colic is the "first bump in the road for many parents," he said, "it will influence how you deal with the second, the third, and so on, creating a template for how you deal with future interactions with your child. Sure, we know the crying is going to stop, but the damage that's done to the mother and the family can be long- lasting and hard to put right again." Still, the research on the long-term effects of colic on infants and their par- ents is, at best, preliminary, and the respective contributions of genes and environment in triggering the condition remain murky. Lester concedes that most people who suffered from colic as infants and from temper tantrums as toddlers do not exhibit behavioral prob- lems as adults, regardless of how their parents responded to their cries. A few weeks ago, I spoke to Amanda Chase, who told me that her twins had got over their colic in early March, when they were about six months old. "I was relieved, but too exhausted to really ap- preciate it," she said. "I feel as though I lost a good six months of my life." She added that one night, around the time the twins began to improve, she had stayed up late reading about colic on a parenting Web site. "A mother wrote in, sounding incredibly depressed and overwhelmed, about a baby that she felt she could not put down," Amanda said. "I remember she said, 'I don't know how much longer I can do this; I have to hold her twenty-four hours a day.' It was the middle of the night, and I should have been asleep, but I couldn't go to bed without leaving her with some support. I wrote her a long e-mail in which I urged her to get someone to spell her. You just feel so helpless-as helpless as the babies themselves." .
Pepita, even at six, possessed a self-con- tained independence. Consuelo was the one most in need of support. Strangers made her tiinid; away froin home she faced each new situation half anticipat- ing failure. The three little girls were at the same stage in all their studIes, and were put into the saIne grade in school, but in different classrooms Consuelo's class was presided over by a Miss Coombs. She was a Inean woman, who brought to Las Vegas all of a lower-Iniddle-class Middle Westerner's resentlnent of and hostility toward the exotic characteristics of the Spanish Southwest. "'That preju- dices were not native to her she was quick to acquire froin the Texans who eternally infiltrate New Mexico. To her, this child with jet-black hair and unusually large brown eyes was just another little Mexican, except that, Î1n- properly, she was a well-dressed, well- fed little Mexican with an unconsciously proud carriage, who spoke correct, un- localized English with only the faintest occasional Spanish intonations It fur- ther offended MIss Coolnbs to know that Consuelo's father was a Inan of eminence and uthority, whon1 people, even those she would call J\.mericans, spoke of as a possible candidate for gov- ernor Outwardly proud, inwardly unsure of herself, unable to read the blackboard, Consuelo Inissed a sÎ1nple question early in the school year. Miss Coombs pounced on her, and continued to pounce unflaggingly, week after week. Misery spread over the girl's life, taking out the light, killing the colors, chang- ing it absolutely. Mornings were for feeling sick to one's stoinach and crying quietly on the way to school; the infinite '^ hours before school let out were for hoping desperatelv to be overlooked; the ; øilci ". j!sly': rest of the day was for trying not to "0: reinember that morning Inust COlne _ agaIn. The children obviously were not re- ceiving the kind of education their par- ents had in Inind. Moreover, of their plaYlnates many spoke the slurred New < Mexico dialect of Spanish, and others equally dialectic English. Everything be- ing taken into consideration, the experi- ment was not a success. To the joy of all of them, the Bacas returned to the ranch in the spring, and Don J osé and Doña Marguerite set about finding a suitable governess. This was no sÎ1nple Inatter.

The feral pig problem is spreading in Kentucky. The animals aren’t native to the commonwealth, but were illegally brought into the state and let loose for hunting. They’ve been copiously reproducing ever since.
In 2009, wild pigs were only in about 23 of Kentucky’s 120 counties. Now, they’re in 44, and spreading.
Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife spokesman Mark Marraccini says the animals have few redeeming characteristics.
“They’re very destructive,” he said. “They carry a host of diseases; they can infect livestock, pets and even people. They have pretty incredible reproductive rates, they destroy habitat. They compete with native wildlife; they simply out-compete native wildlife for the food that’s there.”
In other areas, like the Bernheim Forest, the wild pig problem has improved. There were a number of the animals for several years, but the number seems to have decreased lately according to a spokeswoman.
It’s illegal to bring wild pigs into the state, and two people have been convicted so far this year and fined. Hunting the animals is legal, and the meat can harvested for bacon, ham, and other pork products.

The American Military has saved the Republic. If you recall a post we shared with all of you last week; The American Military Will Act To Save The Republic.
This is exactly what has occurred. Furthermore, it occurred so smoothly, no one was able to notice anything unusual. It is our understanding that the U.S Military has been on high alert for the past three months, but more importantly they were very active in regards to elections and rumored false flag attacks, from November 1st to Election Day, and continue to be moving forward, for the mission is not 100% complete.
A special greeting was sent to the Cabal as a heads up that if they attempt to hack the computers, and commit election fraud, the military would intervene, cancel the elections and publicly arrest Hillary Clinton.
Now, what does Donald Trump’s win mean? The short and simple answer is the Cabal has finally been defeated.
We are in the final stretch of this peaceful revolution. We are nearing the completion of the process towards true freedom. The next step is the announcement of NESARA(NESARA: National Economic Security and Reformation Act) to America. And the Revaluation of the world’s currencies.
With certainty we can say to expect major announcements regarding NESARA and the Global Currency Reset in the coming days.

We could not be more pleased – and honored – to share some of our client’s experiences after going through our neurofeedback program. Words truly can’t express the feeling associated with helping others improve their lives!
“Steve and his staff have been extremely helpful as I made the decision to try neurofeedback. He has helped me understand how it works and it has been a great customer experience. Aside from the great atmosphere and staff, neurofeedback has greatly improved my ability to focus, has helped me with emotional stability as well as I now think before I make a decision. I highly recommend BrainTraining of Hampton Roads for anyone making the consideration. Thank you Steve!”
“The change in my daughter after only 25 sessions has been remarkable. She dropped out of college, was withdrawn, unattached to anyone, fearful of life and in a very dark place. After being diagnosed by Amen Brain Clinic with PTSD we knew where her brain was “disconnected.” Steve and BrainTraining of Hampton Roads was able to create a Neurofeedback program that addressed exactly where she was hurting the most and miracle of all miracles she was so improved she happily went back to school this semester. Amazing, really.”
“This was extremely helpful for my anxiety and distraction. Steve is helpful and knowledgeable and uses incredible technology to observe brainwaves and how they are imbalanced which can lead to increased anxiety and attention disorders. I saw amazing improvement in just 3 months”.
“As a Fibromyalgia sufferer and graduate student, I was at my wits end dealing with brain fog, memory problems, the inability to focus, and anxiety. I came to BrainTraining of Hampton Roads out of desperation and it has made a tremendous difference in my quality of life. I can think clearly, my ability to focus and stay focused has improved, and my anxiety levels have dropped drastically. I also usually get at least one debilitating pain flare up in the spring and this spring that didn’t happen! I have even been able to reduce the amount of medication I take. I wish I had tried this sooner! I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from Fibromyalgia.”
“My daughter had very high anxiety to the point where she would get up several times in the evening, constantly waking us up because she would get scared about the smallest thing or because her mind was simply overactive about something that would keep her awake. Since she’s been working with BrainTraining of Hampton Roads she has started to slow her brain down, talking through her issues and learning to deal with them. She is now sleeping through the night after eight years of not being able to do so and is a much happier child.”
“BrainTraining of Hampton Roads has been a tremendous blessing to my family. After many stressful events my three-year old was showing signs of secondary trauma. I was disheartened to see the change in my little boy, however, neurofeedback provided hope along with great results. My son was less agitated and aggressive. His focus increased while meltdowns decreased. He slept better. It was once again pleasant to interact with him. The difference neurofeedback made was incredible. I highly recommend BrainTraining of Hampton Roads and am thankful for the results we experienced.”
“I cannot thank BrainTraining of Hampton Roads enough for the help they provided for my son. He suffers from Asperger’s and behavior issues. I’m a single mom with two sons; it was a lot of stress on our family to deal with my son’s attitude, disciplinary calls from school, his constant growling and refusal to comply with very easy requests.
We went through the testing and the initial set of sessions with BrainTraining. My son’s behavior improved significantly. He was no longer growling at me and he was turning into the happier kid that I knew before. We will definitely be returning to do more sessions. I hope to see even more improvement.”
“What a huge turnaround my son has made since working with BrainTraining of Hampton Roads for his anxiety! Everything from being more outgoing in classes, gregarious with his friends and teammates, to just in general smiling and laughing more. I am thrilled to see that he is also focusing on short term and long-term goals, getting in the habit of writing specific goals down before golf matches. It fills my cup to see him coming into this comfort and confident zone.”
“My son has been a patient of BrainTraining of Hampton Roads for 4 months. He is now age 20 and has been diagnosed with ADHD, OCD, ODD, depression and anxiety. For the past 9 years we have been to psychiatrists, psychologists and therapists with varying techniques. There were some times we could see an improvement, but nothing close to the changes we have seen with neurofeedback. We can now have actual conversations without the screaming and door slamming. My son actually told me he could tell something was different now that he is able to stop and think before reacting. The changes have far exceeded our best expectations. We will now continue with the hope of being able to reduce and/or eliminate certain medications. We are forever grateful.”
Our neurofeedback program allows us to create a customized, non-invasive, drugless protocol to support improved health naturally.
I was directly involved within the realm of fine art for nearly thirty years, first as a struggling painter and eventually as the director of a fine art gallery specializing in important 20th Century masterworks. I was fortunate to have been in the private company of such great masters as Willem de Kooning and Roberto Matta, to hear first hand their fascinating accounts of straddling the frontiers of Modern Art and therefore, Abstract Thought.
My prime function over this time had been to help various people to come to grips with their inevitable and enigmatic confrontation with Abstract Art. Perhaps the scariest terrain for any burgeoning intellect, most people either dismiss non-objective art [particularly paintings] entirely, or struggle helplessly in front of say, a Jackson Pollack drip painting. My job has been to help those I could, [those who wanted help], with understanding a way to interpret what they were seeing by opening up their own special blend of Intuitive Reasoning in resolving the issue.
I still consider myself a struggling artist, as it has been my purpose over this period of time to develop an acute sensibility for what I call, the Fifth Dimensional Sphere of Reference. It is where my art form exists. I christened it the day I left graduate studies and went into the gallery business. From my perspective, two-dimensional referred to paintings and drawings, 3-D was structural sculpture, and science had dubbed the Fourth Dimension as Time. So, I called this Fifth Dimension, the dimension of Communication. More accurately, it is the communication of intuition from one sentience to another. It combines all aspects of the other dimensions and produces a synergistic system called, Awareness.
To me, Art promotes awareness, but, ironically, Science cannot seem to grasp its scope, because it extends beyond the parameters of measurable Time & Space. Although there are reams of documentation as to the existence of awareness, no where is there any proof as to how it works.
Fundamental scientists, adhering to the sterile atmosphere of objective observation, are now confronted with the conundrum of the performance of sub-atomic particles, acting as quantum waves when they're not looking. Aren't we all guilty of looking out of the corner of our eye to see if it's real, just beyond? Artists, on the other hand, must face this issue straight on.
An Artist can be any individual in any walk of life, not necessarily a painter or sculptor. I've met a wide variety over the years. The one criterion for each is that they are performing with an enhanced level of awareness over and above the so-called 'norm.' They consciously manipulate their environment, whether its made of clay or words, musical notes or numbers. Not all are successful in their careers, but each is driven to do what they do by a compunction stronger that mere survival. Yes, we're all artists in our own way, because we've perceived awareness and have felt intuition. What separates us, however, is what and how we choose to do about it.
So, you may ask, how does one get a handle on it? For me, it is both as simple and complex as you can imagine. For one thing, logic must be checked at the door as we develop an Intuitive Body based upon experiential data. From this perspective, one can refine the way we experience incoming data, to have a direct affect upon our perception of all incoming experiences. In other words, we are what we create and we manifest our own realities.
Perception in this context, equals knowledge. Knowledge in this case, is different from intellect, in that we attain intelligence in measure, while knowledge is received in mass. Awareness can also equal knowledge, and therefore both perception and awareness can be seen as aspects of the same force of mind that may open us up to that most treasured of states, Knowledge of Self.
Knowledge of Self should be the most important criteria for existence, not survival! I believe it is the primary purpose of human consciousness, and the use of the human mind as its gathering tool. It is our most precious element; far greater than food, shelter, sex or power over others.
True Awareness, as far as I'm concerned, is attained when the Heart [the right-brain emotional center and receptacle for Intuition] links together with the Mind [the left-brain intellectual processing center]. Together in perfect harmony, they may form a field of thought, and suspended somewhere within that field, the Realm of Awareness takes shape as a third point of reference. This alternate point is a perceived emotion or a felt perception that is both intuitively acknowledged and intellectually identified. It is the realm of the Soul.
Another way to understand the Awareness Construct is to see it metaphorically, as a classic pyramidal design, that when viewed as a cross-section, is comprised of five ascending layers from its base to its pinnacle. Five is considered by metaphysicians as the sacred number of Man and by ancient analogy, the Great Pyramid, with its five sides, [four ascending planes from a base], exemplifies the metaphysical qualities of the Human Consciousness. I'll call this the Field of Awareness for this description. Let me further adapt this construct to include a growth metaphor for descriptive purposes.
The base level of this Field of Awareness is comprised of the most complexly dense material that makes up the basis for the pure singularity of each individual Self. It can be thought of as the fertile earth of consciousness, primed for planting. Individual consciousness may then be viewed as a tree (as in Tree of Life). As we begin our life-cycle of physical existence, we are in effect, sprouting a new seedling, or new potential aspects from the base soil that is the Self. This Core Self, as it has been called, is Human Consciousness, beyond Time & Space. It is the sum total of all human experiential awareness, seen here as a mulched top soil, providing rich nutrients for growth.
Situated directly above that plateau in this scheme, rests the bi-polar definitive arena of contrasting elements: yes/no; positive/negative; up/down, etc. This highly complex and dense region can be defined in terms of Action and the verb To Be. Creative energy generated from the friction of physical existence, provides the nourishment for this growth system to continue its upward climb from four directions at once. Imagine roots and stalks pushing their way through heavy top soil.
From these two base levels of support and growth, the essential third aspect of consciousness, Perspective, begins to sprout as limbs. This third dimensional level, this initial triad, is the basis for all Consensus Reality. Situated at the very center axis point of the configuration, it divides the lower consciousness of Instincts from the higher realms of Intuition. Using this growth metaphor, it is the defining aspects of the species, structure and fullness of the individual tree.
The first level of this higher realm, the Fourth Dimension, has been identified by scientists as Time. It is an understanding among the learned, of the way our physical reality moves through space, and has been defined by Physicists in terms of vibrations of sub-atomic particles/waves in Quantum Theory. The volumes of words poured into the understanding of this dimension are many, though, only few among us can begin to grasp their scope. Metaphorically they can be seen as the leaves of the tree, reflecting the multiplicity of individuality, and the cyclic nature of existence. An understanding of this natural phenomenon provides, however, a doorway, as it were, to the next level: the pinnacle or capstone, the Realm of Awareness. The Fifth Dimension. The Flower of Consciousness.
The first level of firmament supports the sprout of the singularity of mind from this rich soil of Human Consciousness.
Second, is the realization of structuring outside of the self, as roots dig into this fertile earth.
Limbs reach out into the third dimension, giving perspective to the first two and providing an axis point from which to measure 'Reality.'
'Leafing' into the fourth dimension of consciousness one can begin to recognize the shape, contour and movement through space, of the third dimensional consciousness.
The blooming capstone is, as a matter of course, a fifth dimensional consciousness that has the capacity to further seed Awareness through Communication.
Awareness then can be seen as the capacity to recognize the flowers for what they really are: thought forms of expression of the essence of existence of Human Consciousness.
This pyramidal/tree paradigm only describes the domain of the explainable; what can be communicated via symbols. There also exists, the inexplicable dimensions six through nine, that defy our understanding (through the use of word symbols) but provide some hints of their existence. Since only a few among us have truly accessed this fifth dimensional consciousness, it is fair to say that only a fraction of us have begun to deal with these other dimensional aspects of our being. That is because the majority of people are slaves to their own symbols of the world they have created. They have become entrenched within their own conceptual limitations and fail to recognize the nature or even the significance of the reflection before them.
Dimensions six through nine exist as a mirror to the Cognitive Awareness of consciousness as defined by the initial five dimensional aspects. This other realm can only be defined in terms of our Intuitive Awareness. To begin to comprehend this inexplicable domain we have only to engage the most powerful tool of our awareness: Imagination. When we purposefully engage our Imagination with Intuitive Awareness, we can form the next vital aspect of this non-verbal realm:
So the question then becomes, How best can this new purpose for existence be served? Once asked from the inner core that is our human consciousness, answers appear where ever the human mind is present.

With the introduction of the Import Verification System (IVS) on the 15th of August 2011 and the amendments to the applicable Exchange Control Rulings of the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank (“Finsurv”) during December 2011, it is no longer a requirement for Authorised Dealers to endorse documentation “Exchange Provided” for import payments.
Kindly note that this also applies to those clients that have been granted dispensation by Finsurv from the requirement to submit supporting documentation to their Authorised Dealers for every foreign exchange transaction related to an import transaction – the so called “Imports Undertaking Dispensation” and that are responsible for complying with the Undertaking and Exchange Control Rulings.
The documentation still needs to be submitted in order for the bank to conduct the necessary due diligence checks as well as record the document references on the IVS hosted by SARB to electronically match the import payments to goods received and declared to Customs.
Supporting documentation for import payments can be emailed or faxed to the following Standard Bank branches:

I think I am allergic to March, because everything is still so frozen and snow-covered there’s no way this crazy sinus pain is related to actual allergies. There’s no pollen yet! Nothing is blooming! Why do my eyeballs feel like they’re going to burst out of my head?!
I gave in and took a Sudafed (the non-meth-making kind) and it helped a lot, but it also hurts my milk supply so I can’t make it a regular thing. Although I suppose I could just chug water and eat a ton of cookies and say the calories are “for the baby”. That sounds like it might help with the sinus pain too.
The cure for your sinus pain is essential oils. And #whole30. And jamberry. Everything I know I read on facebook.

While the first generation of vape shops aimed to be bars peddling e-juice in place of booze, a couple of recent arrivals have also aimed to double as art galleries. Could this finally do the unimaginable and make vaping cool? I hit a couple of these artsy aspirants to find out.
The City Council’s ban on vaping in public places created a need for communal spaces where e-cigarettes could be consumed, hence the rise of vape bars where you can buy and try the stuff. Here, vape clerks are essentially bartenders who guide you through sticky liquids of fruity, sweet, or coffee flavors (savory e-juice flavors aren’t as popular for some reason but they do exist: chicken n’ waffles, pizza, popcorn are all out there) and talk shop about coils, mods, tanks. While vaping does have a rebellious bent, it hasn’t been embraced by pop culture to the extent that cigarettes have. Tobacco is still the indisputably cooler cousin. In comparison, vaping just seems cheesy.
But places like Avant Garde Vapor Lounge are trying to change that. The shop, which opened up on the Lower East Side five months back, is dominated by huge, psychedelic paintings and there’s a long bar where, on a Thursday afternoon, several bored-looking skater types (all men, per usual) were hanging out, vaping away, and chatting. When I walked in, I had to do a double take to make sure there wasn’t a sign on the door that read “No unaccompanied women allowed.” Unfortunately this vibe is the norm for vape shops.
Half the time you walk into these places you get the feeling the people hanging around puffing away rarely stray far from MRM forums and World of Warcraft. That fedora they’re wearing is a sign that it’s a big day out for Jason.
Like its patrons, vape culture has a distinct attitude: a laid-back stoner vibe with a libertarian streak. Vape shops are usually plastered in half-assed campaigns to “Save Vaping in New York.” One flyer found at Henley, in Soho, read, “Help us fund a lobbyist, vape shops are under attack and could go out of business.” As we’ve reported, numerous new bills have been introduced in Albany that, in their view, at worst could result in the loss of “your right to vape all together.”
Though for obvious reasons vape advocates are resistant to most kinds of regulation, some of the resistance seems straight up dangerous. Manufacturers of e-juice, for example, are not required to list ingredients and every time I’ve asked a vape sales person to tell me what’s in this stuff, they shrug. Yes, there are a handful of companies out there dedicated to all-natural ingredients and the like, but given the lack of laws, you still have to take their word for it.
Scarier yet, a 2014 study released by the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (an organization which, yes, sounds very shady but publishes a peer-reviewed journal through Oxford University Press and is supported by the FDA) found that up to 70 percent of sweet tasting e-cigarettes contain diacetyl, a dangerous chemical used in artificial butter flavoring which is safe to eat in small amounts but toxic when inhaled. Diacetyl causes a disease known as popcorn lung, an irreversible condition that resembles bronchitis. Yikes.
Harmless by comparison is vape culture’s unique aesthetic: one part Renaissance, one part psychedelic. The mostly men who work at the places are the grown up version of that disgruntled teenaged employee of a mall kiosk (you must be 21 or older to vape) and sprouted a fuller crop of unclassifiable facial hair. He’s perhaps worked at said vape emporium long enough to buy that Supreme hat he’s been eyeing, which looks just divine perched atop crisp white vans and black socks that hit at his calf.
His first paycheck of course was blown on a really tricked-out Tugboat Mod and he’s been fiddling with the homemade coils on this thing for weeks, but nearly has it to full-blown torch capacity. In the meantime you better believe this thing is still making monster clouds.
While the aforementioned Henley shop isn’t completely free of this vibe (see the Bitcoin ATM), it’s certainly trying to buck the trend. While there weren’t exactly throngs of women patronizing this place, it felt a little more welcoming to at least one. And while there was a fair amount of nerding out about mods and flavors and whatever over the reclaimed wood bar, there was also plenty of space to escape that sometimes oppressive banter.
Henley has a massive, green backyard complete with a grill and plenty of seating, something rarely seen in Manhattan. The inside was miles more sophisticated than most vape shops I’ve seen: designer furniture from a shop in Red Hook sat atop a red poured concrete floor. And for once, the art wasn’t horrible. Though black-and-white photographs of people puffing enormous vape clouds isn’t exactly groundbreaking stuff, it’s much less offensive than handing some 13-year-old boy who just discovered marijuana a paint brush and telling him to go at it. But overall the shop feels open, airy, well-designed, and above all comfortable.
Henley is even hosting a monthly art event of sorts that will be ongoing until October. The Secret Garden Series is curated by artist and DJ Kimyon Huggins and will feature the work of two artists every month through October. He’s chosen locally-based street artists who hail from all over the world to paint a wall located in the backyard at Henley. This month’s mural, a baby blue, black-and-white wash of scribbled faces, was painted by NDA. Apparently Henley has given the artists pretty much free reign and Huggins told us that he expects the next two artists, GILF and Ivan Orama to engage with politically themed pieces.
Vape shops, even Henley, still have a long way to go before they feel accessible to everyone. There were many reasons why vaping didn’t work for me and why I lost interest, but one factor was that I was embarrassed to vape given all of these associations. But vaping isn’t just suffering from an image problem, it’s also at a crossroads in terms of legality.
Blanket opposition to any regulation is probably not very wise, because with better knowledge about the ingredients, more people might feel welcome. But even that is a sticky aim, because one thing that vaping succeeds at is disassociating itself from tobacco and thus unraveling itself from immediate associations with lung cancer. And as of yet, we all need to admit, vape shop owners especially, that it remains to be seen what kinds of adverse health effects will emerge from vaping. And maybe this lack of acknowledgement and accountability is why vaping is still an adolescent boy.
i had an affair with a married woman a while back (it was awesome, but heartbreaking). i smoked but she + her husband didn’t… henley was my choice. i liked the small disposables. but yeah vape shops are weird. if you’re ever in the area and need to pee their bathroom policy seems to be don’t care.

Every child love to paint, draw and make colorful things and pictures. So, every house with children needs a crafting box and coloring material, so that they can paint and draw their imagination in their idle time. With a few basic supplies and a little creativity, an idle day can turn into a fun day and a creative wonderland of colorful glitter, glue and paint. So, if you don’t have these materials get them now to keep yourself ready to get crafty with the kids. You can give your children book of art and craft so that they can get new ideas on crafting.
In order to make a variety of crafts you must have a good number of color paper, art paper, construction paper, etc., then only it is possible to make crafting a fun activity for the kids. Construction paper is used for covering surfaces and also to collage scenes by cutting and pasting different shapes on it. Crepe paper can also be used for your craft making as it gives excellent texture to any craft due to its grainy quality. Whereas for watercolor painting or simple drawing white computer paper can be used.
Although your kids are creative enough, but, it’s not a bad idea to give them a few good books on art & craft, so that they can learn something more and get much more creative.
A wide range of coloring and paint supplies are required for any crafter, so it should be on hand prior than you begin to make any craft. Watercolors and acrylic paints are ideal for all age groups when they have to make an abstract or paint-by-numbers crafts. For drawing and detailing wax crayons, colored pencils and markers are best items.
Basic crafting tools also comprise scissors in order to cut fabric and paper, as well as safety scissors with rounded edges for small children. Patterned-edge scissors are useful for adding a decorative edge to crafts like photo frames and cards. A large variety of paint brushes is also required that are suitable for painting large areas and for detail work. Brushes can also be used for applying liquid glue on a big surface area, because it is quite hard to apply glue on large areas with fingers, glue stick or tube. Crafters should also have pencils, permanent markers, staplers and rulers.
Glue will be required by the home crafters to paste all substances and textures available. For younger children glue sticks are ideal, while liquid glue is a stronger adhesive but needs proper supervision for children under five.

Whether you're using Windows Phone 8.1 or Windows 10 Mobile, the chances are that you've settled on the 'Bing image of the day' as your lockscreen. Stunning curated images from commercial collections, every day that are, seemingly, just as well suited to the portrait phone screen as to the landscape desktop aspect ratio - thanks to some clever selection and even more clever cropping. But a day later and they're gone. How can you enjoy them after the fact?
Now, you can't just screenshot it, since you'll have icons and information in the way. And you also can't, even with this article (usually) grab a high resolution original, for obvious copyright reasons - Getty Images and other commercial galleries are often used. Microsoft pays the royalty fees so you don't have to, etc. They do put in a Bing watermark, but this is perhaps a small price to pay for 'free'?
What you can do is dive through to save the photo in so-called 'wallpaper resolution' - so 1080p, either in portrait or landscape orientation, depending on which device you do all this on.
The starting point - you turn on your Windows phone and there's a cracking new Bing image of the day. Just stunning. You want to save it. Or use it somehow:
On the phone, the way to find out more about the image is to head into Settings/Personalisation/Lockscreen and then in small writing underneath the 'Background - Bing' selection is the description, in this case 'North shore of Lake Superior', etc. Sadly, it's not hyperlinked, but at least you know what the image is.
To get more information, you can use the fact that the same image is used in many other places through the day. For starters, in Internet Explorer (under WP8.1) or Edge (under W10M), go to bing.com and you should see the same photo. Swipe up a little and there's a little panel shown (above, right). You can try tapping through (the '>' control):
...however, this takes you to a suitable search in Bing images, which often doesn't help, since the photo concerned is commercial. So, it's a useful way to find more images of the scene or object in question, but no use if you want the exact photo you were so impressed by.
Happily, there's also a download icon on the mini-panel and tapping this gives you a licensed (presumably for your personal use) 'wallpaper'-sized version of the image (being downloaded, above, right).
This is about 2MP, typically, 1080 x 1920 for a portrait device (here), as you can verify by opening the download up and looking in the '...' menu under 'Properties' (above, right).
But there's more. Although the portrait image above is excellent, you'll have noted that the mobile versions of the Bing images of the day are crops from a wider, perhaps even better photo. So it's worth starting up your desktop PC at this point, or opening up your Surface Pro, or whatever, and again going to bing.com in the Edge browser:
Again there's a mini-panel about the image and again there's a download link. This produces a slightly larger image in terms of megapixels but slightly smaller in the vertical direction - you get a landscape image of 1920 x 1200 pixels:
But this is still perfectly fine for any personal uses you might have for the photo. So I guess it depends whether you prefer the vertical slice or the 'cinematic' version.
There's the matter of the Bing watermark, bottom right, but you may be able to crop this out or obscure if it really offends you (it's rarely bothered me).
Note also in the mini-panel on Bing.com that there are left and right arrow controls - these give you access to previous days' Bing images, should you have left it too late before visiting the site. In fact, you'll have fun browsing back in time and saving a few previous classic images, no doubt.
In any case - great images from the Bing team and now you know how to save them, both on the phone and on the desktop!

Almost a year ago, guest writer Matthew Weflen pitched the classic Lumia 950 camera against the (then) Sony flagship, the XZ Premium, with the fight being very close but with the Lumia ultimately winning out. Ten months later he has the brand new Sony XZ2 Premium in hand, the company's highest end Android phone for 2018. Time for his latest imaging shootout!
(If anyone's wondering about that Windows-esque launcher on Matthew's XZ2 Premium, it's SquareHome 2...)
Astute AAWP readers may recall my previous guest shootouts, the Lumia 950 vs the Sony Xperia XA1 and vs the Sony Xperia XZ Premium. I liked the performance and build quality of both phones, and so was very interested in trying the XZ Premium’s successor, the XZ2 Premium.
Released in July 2018, the XZ2 Premium is powered by Qualcomm’s newest Snapdragon 845 SoC and 6gb of RAM. The camera module is also Sony’s flagship standard, the “Motion Eye.” This moniker probably refers to the camera’s ability to take 960 FPS slow motion video at 1080pas well as its fancy moving laser focus adjustments during burst shooting. It is a “stacked memory” chip, with RAM sandwiched in between the CMOS and control circuitry layers for faster processing (which is what allows the aforementioned motion features). The sensor is 19 megapixels sized at 1/2.3”, and has an f/1.8 aperture 25mm lens. New for this model is a second camera, a 12 MP monochrome shooter weighing in at f/1.6 aperture and 1/2.3”. Sony says this combo will lead to very good low-light performance (the second lens is not dedicated to zoom), and allows for crazy high ISO shooting, up to 51,200.
It will again do battle with the Lumia 950’s 20-megapixel sensor, sized at 1/2.4”, with a f/1.9 aperture 26mm lens. The Lumia 950 has physical Optical Image Stabilization, while the XZ2 Premium does not, opting again for Qualcomm’s digital “EIS” solution instead. So let’s start snapping and pit the results against each other, using the Famed Optical Comparator. All shots were taken on auto settings at full resolution, and cropped to 900x500 for close up “pixel peeping” comparisons.
Note that the interactive comparator below uses javascript and does need to load each pair of images. Please be patient while this page loads, if you see a pair of images above each other than you've either not waited long enough or your browser isn't capable enough! You ideally need a powerful, large-screened tablet or a proper laptop or desktop. This comparator may not work in some browsers. Sorry about that. On Windows 10 Mobile, use the 'AAWP Universal' UWP app, which handles the comparator very competently (see the tips in the app's help screens). On Android and iOS, all bets are off. Use something more capable(!)
Let’s start with some easy stuff, which every smartphone shooter worth its salt should ace: an outdoor shot of building and foliage. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
In case you want to grab the original images to do your own analysis, here they are, from the Lumia 950 and Sony XZ2 Premium, click the links to download. And to look at the images in more detail, here are fairly central 1:1 crops, again use your mouse or trackpad pointer to compare the images:
The 950 presents a smoother and warmer shot overall. The XZ2 Premium’s shot is cooler and more noisy. As far as detail goes, the shots seem pretty even. The 950’s smoothing algorithm makes things smoosh together a bit, while the XZ2P’s noise gives an impression of more detail. At non-pixel-peeping distances, both shots are quite pleasing overall. Overall, I tend to like the 950 shot just a bit better, as the XZ2P has an edge-enhanced look.
I decided to get closer to a day lit subject, a quite lovely flower. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
Both shots are quite nice, with a pleasing Bokeh effect on the leaves in the background, vibrant color, and very good detail. Here’ the XZ2 Premium’s noise turns out to be a good thing, as it allows the striations of color in the petals to be more easily picked out. The 950 is smoother, which works better on the pollen vesicles. Both shots consistently wowed everyone I showed them to. As such, overall, this is a wash to me.
Enlisting the very enthusiastic participation of my children, I decided to test one of the true staples of smartphone shots – the brightly lit picture of kids. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
Looking at both shots in total, both are nice, but the 950 is better both from a distance and when pixel-peeping. The smoothing algorithm does not wipe away any detail, instead presenting a very life-like feel. The foliage, the concrete, the bus stop, and the kids all look naturalistic. The XZ2 Premium matches the 950 pretty well on detail, but the noise gives the shot a bit of a crunchy feel when zooming in. This one goes to the 950 for me.
This is a scene overlooking the Chicago River downtown. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
The “noise vs. smoothing” narrative plays out again here to some degree. When viewed in total, both shots are pleasing. The 950 exhibits better dynamic range, while the XZ2P finds colours in the image that the 950 doesn’t (for instance, in some windows, on the rusty metal bits down by the water). But the noise in the XZ2P image on closer inspection is off-putting compared to the 950’s smoother output.
All right, let’s stop messing around on the easy stuff. Moving indoors for the evening, I shot a picture of my cat lounging with me on the couch. The scene is lit only by one lamp, with an 800 Lumen light bulb and a dark shade. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
This is a pretty strong argument for the XZ2 Premium’s second sensor. There is simply more detail in the XZ2P shot than in the 950’s. Whiskers, small hairs, the texture of my sock, it’s all just more present. The XZ2P’s shot is much more convincing when viewed in total. Upon pixel peeping, there is the noise characteristic of high ISO shooting (the XZ2P chose ISO 1250 using the auto settings, while the 950 chose 640). But the noise adds to the image here instead of detracting from it.
Let’s head outdoors at night to look at the alley behind my condominium. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
While every shot thus far has been taken hand held, here I stabilized both phones on the rail of my balcony to give both cameras their best possible chance with this low-lit night shot. The 950 has an admirable level of detail but the dynamic range is rather flat. Shadows look grayish. The XZ2 Premium delivers a noisier shot, but the detail level is comparable and the shadows and highlights are much more convincing. The XZ2 Premium also does a better job with foliage and overall color. This is a tough call, and I think on their strengths both shots are about even.
All right, no more pussy-footing around. Let’s really push these cameras. This is a plaza in downtown Chicago taken at night time. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
This shot was taken hand held while standing. I took several snaps with each to ensure that hand shake was not a factor. This was the best shot the 950 could come up with, and frankly, the XZ2 Premium blows away the 950 here. The level of detail is just off the charts on the XZ2 Premium. The rivets in the statue are all clearly visible, as well as small reflections in the windows that the 950 fails to pick up. The XZ2P renders the puddles in the pavement convincingly, while they almost disappear in the 950 shot. The XZ2P even picks up the green granite blocks on the interior of the rear building. A resounding win for the XZ2 Premium.
This is one of my favourite pictures to take downtown at night, and it presents a big challenge for a camera because of the dynamic range from the signs to the shadows. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
Both cameras produced a pleasing shot overall. The 950’s output is again smoother, the XZ2P’s more noisy. There is a flatness to the dynamic range of the 950’s shot that doesn’t really reflect how bright the theater lights are in comparison to the shadowy surroundings. The XZ2P’s shot is more convincing in this. The XZ2 Premium, while more noisy, does clearly pick out more detail in the shadows of the theater’s terra cotta stone elements, as well as in separating the marquee light bulbs and the segments in the marquee surface. But the 950 renders the man and little girl more convincingly – not with more detail, but with less noise. I think, on the strength of the dynamic range and detail, the XZ2 Premium edges this one out.
Another very tough shot, given the range of elements and the fine detail needed to render this shot convincingly. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
Again I braced each camera on a lamp post in order to give each one its best shot. The 950 excels here with dynamic range. The white bus going away from me shows better delineation between the tail lights and the body of the bus. With that said, the XZ2 Premium picks out more detail in the pavement and the bridge structure. Obviously the XZ2 Premium shot is more noisy on close inspection. Both cameras settled on ISO 250 for this shot, so this is a good indicator of their different approaches. I do think the XZ2 Premium has a bit more detail overall, but the 950’s shot is just a bit more pleasing to my eye in total.
Another of my favourite tests for detail, with a mix of produce, currency and knick knacks, taken hand held from above. Here is the whole scene, as presented by the Lumia 950:
Both cameras really do a fine job. The 950 is warmer and renders the bills with a bit less noise. With that said, the XZ2P wrings a little bit more detail out of the pearlescent flakes on the car paint jobs, as well as the carrot. I think this is a tale of two software approaches, and both have their (big) strengths and (minor) weaknesses.
These phones cameras have different strengths. While both phones capture detailed images that would satisfy most users, upon close inspection the 950 does better in bright light and in distance shots, while the XZ2 Premium does better in low light and does equally well with brightly lit close-ups. This is not even to mention the XZ2 Premium’s video capabilities, which are exemplary.
At the end of the day, and after weighing their pluses and minuses, I find these phone cameras to be evenly matched. What it comes down to for me is ecosystem and hardware stability. The 950 simply isn’t usable for me in 2018. It lacks too many apps, the apps it does have are inferior and unsupported compared to their Android counterparts, and the hardware overheats and blows through battery inexplicably. A 2018 phone with a modern chipset and a supported operating system suffers none of these drawbacks.
I want a camera button, expandable storage support, and something approximating live tiles. Android can provide the latter with most models, and Sony provides the former. The 950 featured a camera ahead of its time. But I’ve got to live in the now, not the “what could have been.”
Confining comments to imaging here, the Lumia 950 struggles in low light when focussing is critical. Get the focus right and the 950 can still blow almost anything away, but I'll be the first to admit that its primitive PDAF can let users down when light is low, while the 'laser a/f' plus the far faster chipset in the Sony produce crystal clear focus almost instantly. Oh, for an up to date Lumia with faster supporting chipset and modern focussing technology.
In general, Matthew's choice to use full resolution on each device was interesting - real world users would be best using oversampled shots, e.g. on the Lumia 950 at 8MP, wherein low light shots get even purer. I'll go down these lines as and when I get my own hands on with the XZ2 Premium.

America is a British-American rock band formed in England in 1970 by Dewey Bunnell, Dan Peek, and Gerry Beckley. The trio met as sons of US Air Force personnel stationed in London, where they began performing live.
Achieving significant popularity in the 1970s, the trio was famous for their close vocal harmonies and light acoustic folk rock sound. The band released a string of hit albums and singles, many of which found airplay on pop/soft rock stations.
The band came together shortly after the members' graduation from high school, and a record deal with Warner Bros. Records followed. Their debut 1971 album, America, included the transatlantic hits "A Horse with No Name" and "I Need You"; Homecoming (1972) included the single "Ventura Highway"; and Hat Trick (1973), a modest success on the charts which fared poorly in sales, included one minor hit song "Muskrat Love". 1974's Holiday featured the hits "Tin Man" and "Lonely People"; and 1975's Hearts generated the number one single "Sister Golden Hair" alongside "Daisy Jane." History: America's Greatest Hits, a compilation of hit singles, was released the same year and was certified multi-platinum in the United States and Australia. Peek left the group in 1977, and their commercial fortunes declined, despite a brief return to the top in 1982 with the single "You Can Do Magic".
The group continues to record material and tour with regularity. Their 2007 album Here & Now was a collaboration with a new generation of musicians who credited the band as an influence. America won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist at the 15th Annual Grammy Awards. The group has been inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Ocasio-Cortez: This 'Medicare for all' plan may be expensive, but think of all the money we'll save - Editorial/Opinion - The Briefing Room
Author Topic: Ocasio-Cortez: This 'Medicare for all' plan may be expensive, but think of all the money we'll save (Read 740 times)
Ocasio-Cortez: This 'Medicare for all' plan may be expensive, but think of all the money we'll save in funeral expenses!
Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has some interesting thoughts about "Medicare for all," the $33 trillion program (conservatively estimated) that she maintains will be affordable. Her core agenda item will provide more Americans with access to healthcare, therefore reducing the problem of funeral expenses, she explained this week during an interview on CNN.
Ocasio-Cortez began by trying to delegitimize a recent Mercatus Center study, which put the price tag of "Medicare for all" at $32 trillion, suggesting the report is really some shadowy attempt by the Koch bogeymen to scare people away from the promised land of universal healthcare. Never mind that it squares with other studies.
“You know, in a Koch brothers-funded study, if any study's going to try to be a little bit slanted it would be one funded by the Koch brothers, it shows that 'Medicare for all' is actually much more – is actually much cheaper than the current system that we pay right now,” she said.

I did have a job that had insurance, but my wife was already pregnant when I git the job, so it was a pre-existing condition.
I made a whole 10 cents an hour too much to get free health care, LOL, not that I was asking for it anyway.

My avatar shows the national debt in stacks of $100 bills. If you look very closely under the crane you can see the Statue of Liberty.
I would have to research, before I give you that. Not that MEDIA has anything correct. Well, I found all kind of info. So, Obama gave himself a raise to one million dollars? News to me. What can we believe?
WASHINGTON, DC – President Obama issued an Executive Order raising his salary to $1 million per year.
President Obama understands how much Americans are struggling financially and told reporters yesterday he, too, has been having trouble paying his bills.
“Four hundred thousand dollars a year to be Leader of the Free World, is just not enough.” Obama told reporters on the golf course on Sunday. “There are junior traders at Goldman Sachs that make more than that in a week. Is that fair?”
Obama shocked reporters when he said he issued an Executive Order on Saturday raising his salary to $1 million a year – plus a $200,000 bonus, this year only, for killing Osama Bin Laden.
“Look, let me clear, adjusted for inflation my salary is not even half of what George Washington made. Now, I don’t want to bring race into this, but is the First Black President worth half as much as the First White President? I’m just saying… ”
Congress was quick to respond to Obama’s announcement. “If he gets a pay raise, then I want a pay raise, ” said John Boehner, Speaker of the House. “Hell, I think the whole damn Congress should get a pay raise.”
Boehner went on to say that in today’s world, members of Congress have to spend half their time raising money, “and that means the Representatives we send to Washington are putting in longer and longer hours trying to raise money so they can keep their seats. They need to be paid for that time.”
Obama told Boehner he would give Boehner a raise if, and only if, Boehner agrees to raise the debt ceiling. “Well, that’s a no brainer,” Boehner said. “Let’s take away the ceiling all together. Who likes salary caps?”
The policy debate we should be having is whether health care should be mostly financed by employers (tasked with not only paying for health care but also establishing and administering health care plans), or whether such burden should be financed through general taxation. If we assume that health care accounts for about a third of the compensation paid to most workers, it is easy to see that the savings to employers of tax-financed healthcare is considerable, and puts such employers on a much more equal footing with their foreign counterparts who do not have to absorb similar expense.
If I had it my way, we would go back to the days when the only health insurance you had was "hospitalization." Back then we didn't have a whole lot of specialists and a patient wasn't separately billed by every doctor, radiologist, phlebotomist, custodian, cafeteria worker and anyone who just said "good morning" to you while you wefe laid up in the hospital. When you went to the doctor, you paid him directly. And your doctor didn't need an army of billing and insurance clerks to handle all the paperwork, so your doctor bill was rather low.
I went to the grocery store the other day. They stopped me as I was leaving. They wanted ME to pay for my groceries!
I couldn't believe it. Clearly, either my employer or the government (aka you tax paying suckers or your grandkids) should be paying for my food. That was the debate we should have been having.
And what we're also not talking about is why aren't we incorporating the cost of all the funeral expenses of those who die because they can't afford access to healthcare? That is part of the cost of our system
Because... well... everybody dies, and the cost of a funeral is pretty much the same no matter when they die. Unless she truly believes Medicare for All will bring immortality, she's not going to cut those costs.
Besides, the longer you prop people up with "health care," the more it's going to cost. Alan Grayson put it bluntly that the cheapest health care is to "die quickly."
...she's running for office in a district in which it's almost a certainty that she's going to be elected...!
Google, before all real information is removed. Again, just pointing out all the "information" out there. I had the amount wrong, but not the info back then. So, I need to, NOT believe ,,,any of it.

LOS ANGELES – More than 150 fathers and families from the WWE Universe attended a SummerSlam Fatherhood and Mentoring Rally hosted by Rey Mysterio, Big Brothers Big Sisters of Greater Los Angeles and the Inland Empire, and Catholic Big Brothers Big Sisters. The special rally was held at Bishop Mora Salesian High School in Los Angeles on Aug. 13 during SummerSlam weekend.
The event was inspired by President Obama's Fatherhood and Mentoring initiative, which focuses on the importance of responsible fatherhood and mentoring to build healthy families and communities. Mysterio was joined at the event by officials from Big Brothers Big Sisters, the L.A. Mayor’s Office and the district office of the Speaker of the California General Assembly. The WWE Superstar spoke to the audience about the challenges of being a good father and mentor, and the importance of helping forge the values of younger generations of Americans.
Enrique Gasca, an official from the Los Angeles District Office of the Speaker of the California General Assembly, presented Mysterio, Big Brothers Big Sisters and Bishop Mora Salesian High School with state proclamations thanking them for organizing the event. During the meet-and-greet following the presentations, local residents had the opportunity to speak with Big Brothers Big Sisters volunteers about services provided by the non-profit organization, and were provided pledge cards to complete that would allow them to receive weekly e-mail updates from leaders in the fatherhood and family fields, connect to local programs and services and receive tips on community service.

Pennsylvania IBEW locals have received more than $2 million in state grant money to expand their training centers as a part of Gov. Tom Wolf’s push to support apprenticeships.
Beaver Local 712 and Allentown Local 375 each received about $1 million through the state’s Redevelopment Capital Assistance program, and Wolf announced a $30 million job training program at Pittsburgh Local 5’s training center.
Wolf was elected four years ago with the backing and support of organized labor and this November he faces a union-busting business-owner in his bid for re-election.
“This is the way democracy is supposed to work,” said International President Lonnie R. Stephenson. “We are the majority, not the bankers and CEOs, and elected officials should support policies that help the many, not the few. Too many politicians forget that. Gov. Wolf hasn’t.”
Local 712 is hosting one of the largest union electrical construction projects in the nation. More than 1,000 IBEW members will be working full-tilt for years on the natural gas cracking plant being built by Shell along the Ohio River in Beaver, Pa.
Travelers will step up. It is one of the strengths of the union and benefits of membership that we can man the job, but there is still a need for more apprentices. It’s in everyone’s interest to train more of western Pennsylvania’s young people in a trade that pays far better than the low-skill service jobs currently filling the classifieds.It is good for the citizens, good for the union, good for the employer and good for the state.
But Local 712’s training center is too small, dated and too out-of-the-way for many of the young workers it's looking to attract. With $1 million from the state’s Redevelopment Capital Assistance program, Local 712 plans to build a 20,000 square-foot training center in the heart of it's jurisdiction, making apprenticeship more realistic for people who previously lived hours away.
“Building a new center is exactly the kind of project that needed financing but would have gotten only words,” said Local 712 Business Manager Frank Telesz.
Now, Telesz says, they will be able to sustain apprenticeship classes nearly twice the size of only a few years ago.
“We used to be a one-county local. Now we are four counties and more than 100 miles to the edge of the jurisdiction,” he said. “With this investment, we can broaden our pool of recruits and have a physical presence in half our counties.”
For Local 375, the issue was not manning a single, massive job, but missing out on dozens of small ones. With nearly $1 million through the RCAP, Local 375 planned to expand training space and start a residential program this September.
The new training center will be nearly twice the size of the decades-old center it had been using. Funding came with the support not only of Wolf, but also from the chairman of the State Senate Appropriations Committee, Republican Pat Browne.
“Nothing is free, but I can’t see the downside yet,” said Business Manager Paul Anthony. “Getting the right people in office is good, but it’s not just about party. They have to support our mission and values, and when they do, we need to come out and support them."
RCAP is useful for capital expenditure, but Wolf and the Pennsylvania Legislature wanted to create a competitive grant program that would support ongoing workforce training. Wolf introduced the PASmart initiative in July at Pittsburgh Local 5’s training center.
PASmart will invest $20 million to expand STEM – science, technology, engineering and mathematics – education, $3 million to increase industry partnerships and $7 million to support apprenticeships.
“Apprenticeships transform lives,” said Wolf. “With apprenticeships, people can provide for their families by earning a good living and learning a skill. We need more apprentices to enhance our well-educated and talented workforce and attract more industry to Pennsylvania.”
Wolf’s opponent in November is the CEO of a nonunion trash company and one of the state’s highest-profile proponents of right-to-work laws.
Former state Sen. Scott Wagner even compared the state’s labor movement to ruthless dictators like Adolf Hitler and Vladimir Putin from the floor of the Legislature.
“We have good news to celebrate and an easy decision in the fall,” Stephenson said. “If you want politicians to support policies that help working families, then working families need to support politicians when they do right by us.”
Il maestro Adriano Bettini presenterà il suo nuovo volume di psicomotricità “Gnomo Tobia” domenica 28 ottobre alle ore 11.00 presso la libreria Mondadori di Via Montanini 112 Siena. L’iniziativa rientra nel programma #ioleggoperchè.
OK, we get it. You’re a busy dude or dudette. Business takes priority over almost everything. But let’s make this clear – you still have no excuses for not taking care of your fitness. Here are six reasons why…
Everyone can afford to spare half an hour a day. It’s no time at all. And, if you really can’t spare the time during the day, then just get up earlier. It won’t take long for your body clock to readjust, and it will set you up nicely for the day. You can get a lot done in a half hour, so look into high intensity, super quick sessions that can give you a full workout in half the time.
One of the big differences between the UK and the States used to be that they used to drive a lot more than us. That’s not the case anymore. The trouble is, they have an excuse. Americans need to get in the car to go almost anywhere because it’s such a vast place. The UK isn’t. So drive to work by all means. But try to park a couple of miles away and take a brisk walk for the rest of it. It’s cheap exercise, it’s easy, and it works. You will be surprised at how much better you feel.
You can workout at home, at the gym, in a hotel – or anywhere you like. And the key point to understand is that you can do it for free. There are hundreds of thousands of tutorials, how-to videos, and instructions all over the web, and the cost to you is nothing. So, take a look around and start sorting out the wheat from the chaff.
OK, so a few years ago you could have got away with saying that the gym is shut by the time you finish work. Not anymore, unfortunately. Take a look around your hometown, or the next, and you can almost guarantee there will be a 24-hour fitness centre ready for you to try out. Either fit a session in before you come home from work, or get up earlier and build up sweat beforehand.
In times gone by, gyms were scary places, full to the brim with muscle-bound goons with territory issues. But it just isn’t like that anymore. Most gyms will now welcome you with open arms, due in part to an increase in customer service standards. And, of course, there’s a lot to do with the enormous amount of competitors there are these days. So, if you are made to feel like you don’t belong in one gym, move on to another. It’s as simple as that – and you will find one that suits your level and needs.
And finally, the big one. Being fit and healthy will help you perform better at work. So, if you are spending long hours in the office trying to impress the boss, you might be better off doing something else. Focus on your fitness, and the rest will fall into place a lot quicker.

Hi guys, new around here and don't know if this has been asked before, but what it Matt actually playing during live versions of Unsustainable. I know the guitar tech is doing the whammy, but what is he hitting? Any answers much appreciated, Arjun
It would be if I could find my post with an alrightish Unsustainable tab and MIDI file. James you have leet searching skills. Help pls
Well, this is what I play which for the most part seems accurate. At least going by the making of video (a couple of bits seem different live but it's the same note). Highlighted the main bits I'm unsure of in yellow, but they still sound ok
I can't do the whole strumming behind the nut thing on my guitar so yeah. That's what works with my MIDI file
For anyone interested just did a full cover of it, only on my phone though so sounds a bit shit. One day I'll get a new audio interface
Thanks, I'll give that tab a go tomorrow. I assume that's with the detune set to -1 and the whammy to +1. Also, whats the midi file you are using?
That's with guitar into Whammy 5 (with expression and mode controlled by MIDI) into an Ultimate Octave with octave up on.
I don't know whether the DT has different midi settings for the different modes but if it doesn't then the file I linked should work well enough
I think that the settings the Whammy 5 has are the same MIDI commands on the DT, but obviously the DT has more settings that can be controlled. Also the DT settings are a lot clearer than the Whammy settings. For example, Oct -1 on the DT side sounds a lot better than Oct -1 with the Whammy part. Strange but true. Something to do with the Whammy side needing the ability to pitch bend quickly I'm guessing.
Fancy bits are done with the whammy to make it go weeoo, which I've got closer but still not perfect. If you watch the making of or just listen you can work out the picking pattern

Takeshi Sawada (沢田 タケシ, Sawada Takeshi) is one of Japan's players and part of the Japanese New Golden Age. He usually wears the number "15" jersey.
Despite being two years younger than most of them, Sawada has good dribble techniques and feints. He has played as substitute midfielder in Japan Jr. and Japan Youth, and has also being the captain of U-19 Japan (Golden-23) before being part of U-22 Japan and Olympic Japan.
Takeshi is Hyuga's partner in Meiwa FC. Trained by coach Kira as well, despite his young age (4th grade when he made his debut for the team against Nanbu FC) he's very talented. He has the utmost respect for Hyuga, and is helping him to the best of his abilities when he has troubles, though he doesn't hesitate to point out his mistakes. Takeshi was also vice captain.
Without Hyuga in Meiwa, in the 8th Yomiuriland National junior tournament, Sawada (now as captain) lost the national championship to Shun Nitta.
As Kaori Matsumoto Toho scout recluting, she considered Takeshi Sawada and finally enrolled the Tiny Tactician in order to power up Toho's squad. Then, for around six months, Takeshi was already familiar with Makoto Kitazume's way of coaching (which was, indeed, tying hands to Hyuga's individual and rebellious attitude in favor for a more analyitical style of playing football).
Playing together with his fellow friends Hyuga and Wakashimazu once more, and now the pivot of the midfield area, he had a more important role assigned by coach Kitazume didn't allow Hyuga to play. Trying his best to match Tsubasa as a playmaker who can score, he had troubles against his former teammates from Meiwa, but eventually won against them with the precious help of Sorimachi and Wakashimazu.
He was among the best players of the tournament and thus, was selected in the All Japan Jr. Youth team, despite his young age. He was substitute midfielder most part of the games, but if any change was made, he immediately entered to assist either Hyuga or Tsubasa. He was able to perfect the Toho Combi by doing a Twin Shot and an Overhead Twin Shot with Hyuga.
Entering high school, Sawada was still in Toho with Hyuga and Wakashimazu, and was also selected in the All Japan Youth team. He played the match against Uruguay in the World Youth.
Sawada eventually became a pro by joining the Urawa Red Diamonds, playing with the best libero of Asia Igawa Hayato, who was also the captain of Japan national football team at the time.
He then became the captain and playmaker of the U-19 All Japan Youth team and lead them to the final match of the Asian preliminaries, where he learned to trust his teammates more like Tsubasa. He later joined Olympic Japan for the Asian preliminaries, where his playmaking abilities would come in handy.
He scored the winning goal against Nakatsu SC during pool play when Tsubasa and Hyuga's personal battles ended in a tie.
This feature is used to capture team registrations for an event such as a tournament or jamboree. This is not used to capture individual registrations for an age division or season. Use the individual registration process for those programs.
Your website includes an online registration system that can be used to collect team registrations online, as well as electronic payments. You can specify a number of criteria for program eligibility, costs and and payment methods, including credit card processing.
The registration system handles secure sign-in for registrants and contains built-in forms to gather contact information. In addition, you can specify a number of additional custom questions for whatever information your organization requires, using a variety of question types. Finally, registrants can pay online, securely using a credit card or echeck.
Programs are categories or classifications used to differentiate groups of registrants. For instance you may have separate programs for U11 and U13 and also for those in different grade groups. Each program might have its own set of eligibility requirements, costs and questions. Dividing registrations into multiple programs also makes it easier to manage large numbers of registrants.
When you create or copy and existing program, you'll first specify its general properties such as its title, description, open, late and close dates, and maximum number of registrants. You'll also specify a base cost and late fee (if any). You can also specify a payment schedule if you allow graduated payments. In addition, you can specify merchant account information for processing credit cards.
After specifying general properties for your program, you create or modify the supplemental questions you require, using the provided tools and question types, explained later. The registration engine already asks users for their name, address, phone numbers and email address. Therefore, your form only needs to gather whatever additional information you require.
Finally, you'll want to test the program to make sure everything works as expected before you open it up to the public. To do this, set the open date to today, and mark the registration as Admin-only .
Once your programs are set up and tested, you can make them available to the public by setting their open date to the present. When you do, your website will have a new menu item on the Association menu titled "Register Teams." Visitors will then be able to click it and the resulting page will list the titles and descriptions of the various programs you've set up . They can then choose one and proceed to log in and register.
New members: will be asked for their email address and name, and will subsequently be emailed a password to log in with.
Existing members: (those already in your member database) will be prompted for their email address and their personal password.
Note: users that haven't previously been issued a password or can't remember it can have their existing password emailed to them instantly by entering their email address only and clicking submit.
After your programs have been made available to the public and registration begins, there are several tools available that let you list registrants, account for payments and download all registration data for further processing. Downloaded data can be brought into a spreadsheet or database program for further manipulation.
We allow the use of any merchant account that uses Sage/Net 1, AuthorizeNet, BluePay or Secure Paytech for its gateway as well as PayPal Business accounts for credit card processing. You may Also use a Dwolla account for processing eChecks, and use Nimbus to process credit card transactions to your Dwolla account.
Merchant accounts have the advantage of settling transactions directly to your bank account and offer very competitive rates. The other advantage to using a merchant account is that it allows us to simplify the credit card payment process for your users while keeping them on your website. If your organization does not have a merchant account, LeagueAthletics.com strongly recommends using Cam Neely's Processing with a Purpose through Sage Payment Systems.
While PayPal accounts are easy to set up and accept American Express, Discover and eChecks in addition to Mastercard and Visa, they have the disadvantage of sending your members to another site to process payments. Also, if using a PayPal account you will NOT be able to setup schedule payments in your registration programs.
If your club hosts more than one financial entity (Babe Ruth & Little League for example), you can set up a merchant account for each in order to simplify book keeping. Each registration program has a place for the merchant account ID, so you can use different ones in different programs. Even if a user registers in several programs that have different accounts, they will only be charged once and our software will seamlessly process the different amounts to each account invisibly to the user.
The Add button will create an entirely new, blank registration program and open its properties form.
This button will create an exact copy the currently selected registration program (minus the registered members) from the list and allow you to begin editing its properties form. Once you've set up and tested your first program, you can use this button to quickly copy and modify subsequent versions for the various programs you need to create rather than creating them all from scratch.
Click the Edit button to go to the selected program's properties form. Here you'll be able to specify various settings for the program and continue on to define and edit supplemental questions.
The Delete button will remove the selected program from the list and also delete all its data, both definitions and actual registration data. Obviously, this button should be used with care. You should use it only to clean up obsolete registration programs and their data after they are no longer of use.
Lookout! Once a registration program has been deleted it cannot be restored, so you'll want to make sure you are deleting the correct program. Also, there is no need to delete past registrations as you'll want to keep these for historical records.
The Form button should be used to view, add or edit the supplemental question list. This will only show the questions that you have created. You may edit questions by clicking on their name. You may also add questions by clicking on the "Add a new question" link. Optionally you may click the "Preview the form" link to test your supplemental questions. This will only preview the supplemental question form.
Clicking this button will bring up a listing page showing all members who have signed up for the selected program. The column for the amount paid contains input boxes for each registrant so that you can record checks you receive after someone signs up.
You can also choose to email registrants, transfer registrant from one program to another and add an amount to selected registrants all from this report. Simply check the box to the left of a registrant's name. At the bottom of the page, you can select what you'd like to do from the "Choose Action" drop-down selections.
This button is used to download all the data for the selected program into an Excel file on your computer that you can use for backup purposes or for further processing. As mentioned above, downloaded data can be used in conjunction with other programs to further process data. The file can be directly loaded into other spreadsheet or database programs.
This option allows you to hide those registration programs where the close date is greater than 90 days old.
This information will appear at the top of your Registration page. You can enter any supplemental instructions you may require for your site's Register Online home page. You may want to provide information about general policies, requirements for additional paperwork, eligibility, payment policies, etc.
Github support for org-mode in READMEs is unsatisfying - no code coloring and sometimes it even fails to render to html at all.
I am migrating all my README files to markdown. Googled also this tool for automatic conversion: https://github.com/alexhenning/ORGMODE-Markdown. Will try it next time.
Apart from READMEs I also would like to represent TODO.org files online. While org -formatted READMEs are more or less readable in gitbub's HTML representations, TODO.org files are not readable at all.

It is a topos that needs to be revisited periodically: capitalism is only a problem for those who have no capital. The brighter bits of Marxism reinforce and attempt to resolve this: a redistribution of goods and material wealth to level societies whose material facets have been skewered towards a chosen few. But the problem with poetry is not factory owners; with so little capital invested in poetry, “ownership” as such is more a spiritual than a material issue. The problem with poetry and poets is that you can’t feel the sting of capitalism unless you have no, or little, capital; if you attempt to live off of your poetry (or even as a low-ranking academic) this will almost certainly be the case. Not too many poets have the material shrewdness to earn, through their own efforts, vast amounts of capital; what does happen is that people enter poetry (and the other arts) and are able to do so because of the capital they have inherited. This is more problematic than it appears to be at first—if you can’t feel the sting of capitalism (its’ greed, lack of justice, spiritual entropy), but have had to expend no effort in casting off the shackles that capitalism imposes, your relationship both to the arts and to society itself becomes so ineluctably warped that you might as well be an alien. In America, we call these folks “trust-funders.” Whatever they are called, the attitude they tend to adopt in relation to poetry is one of entitlement; that they are entitled to deem their creations (however meager or nonce) poetry, to adopt an attitude of totalized complacency (without having earned it through genius or innovation), to turn workshops into exercises in egotism and readings into travesties. The attitude of entitlement fits snugly into a post-modern ethos—that art requires a minimum of effort, that any hokey contrivance can, will, and does pass for art, and that the only absolute is simple: capital can and will buy status. That’s the post-modern spirit (which is, of course, a blatant oxymoron); to the funded go the spoils. Marxism works for many poets because they’ve never had the experience of having no capital, so they don’t see or feel its dark edges—conspicuous consumption has engendered an ethos of complete indulgence. Entitlement means that, no matter what these poets create, it has to be as good as anyone else’s creations: they’re as good (of course) as Keats, or Yeats, or Eliot. Post-modern capitalism looks in the check-book rather than the history books to see what the balance is; high numbers take the place of high thoughts.
So the approach that many poets have to Marxism is twice-removed from Marxism in its pure state: by a surfeit of capital, and by a self-satisfaction that accepts and encourages the existent capitalistic system (implicitly, if not explicitly). Poetry becomes a business like any other—if you do good business (manifested in book sales, reading attendance, blog numbers, Google hits, or votes on Goodreads), and if what is quantifiable works in your favor, you are entitled to assume parity with anything or anyone. What is a poet (or an artist) legitimately entitled to? Not much. If you are serious about what you do, if you are not caught in a welter in which post-modern and capitalistic ethos creates a bogus sense of validity, you know that genuine imposition can only be created by history (assuming you are not imposed upon too much be material circumstances). History, if viewed properly, takes back entitlements. The flimsy history created by post-modernity contrives to impose an intimidating veneer; but a lack of real engagement with history creates a sense of the ephemeral which, if not embraced, (and post-modernists do express consonance with the “ephemeral” as such) must be rejected absolutely. Many post-modern equations are simple: “incorporate or perish” is one. What, beyond creating an imposing veneer, constitutes post-modern “incorporation”? Nothing. Post-modernists, for what’s often an obvious reason, feel entitled to stop at the surface; the reason is that a persistent sense of entitlement inhibits and destroys human depth. Deprivation often engenders depth— if you have never been deprived, it is difficult to imagine a need for depth. And if you espouse and embrace Marxist levels of material engagement, but fail to connect them to your own existence and begin to take some personal responsibility for it, you become a kind of sham factory owner. Anyone in the arts who has not inherited funds the way that you have becomes an underling. Underlings can be brushed aside; what begins as warped Marxism becomes straightforward Darwinian obduracy. Simply put, the arts aren’t fair, and they never have been. What post-modernity imposes is a context in which there is not only no justice in who “gets in,” there is no justice in what they feel they are entitled to do when/if they do get in. What do they feel entitled to do, more often than not?
Post-modernity often seems to represent an infinite regress towards oblivion; a plummet that never ends, and in which any kind of ascension becomes the butt of arrogant laughter; if history and art don’t matter, and if you happen to be an artist, satisfaction arises not from what you create but in the sense of entitlement that justifies creating nothing. As much as Marxism is embraced, senses of base and superstructure in this grow confused; there can be no modes of production if what you produce is an acknowledged nothing. One gist of post-modernism is that there is no base— because, we are told, the idea of a “base” in art is a hokey contrivance, and there is no point in actually producing anything (except to preserve appearances.) So why be an artist at all? The reason is simple: because it’s easy. Entitlement, if taken to an extreme (as it often is) negates a sense of responsibility. Do whatever you want; who cares? As the flush ethos dictates, check your numbers, throw out some more red herrings, everything’s fine. But the depth engendered by deprivation has a difficult time accepting this— and post-modernity, like every other paradigmatic movement in the history of the arts, must end. While there is no sure sign that a nascent depth is going to permanently erode the foundations of post-modernism, it is doubtless that different eras require different artistic modes of production to hold a mirror up to dynamic circumstances. In Western life today, a sense of anti-dynamism, of stasis, has been put in place by harsh economic circumstances. It is likely that the post-modernists will respond to this in the same manner that they responded to fin de siècle entropy— with more acknowledged nothings, bolstered (at times and only in bits) by theories that dictate the shrewd and compelling nature of nothings, to reflect back the nothingness that will have been imposed on us if we have borne the brunt of these circumstances. In other words, post-modernism’s potency and efficacy are crippled by the complete material security that enfolds many of its’ constituents. We need something new right now.
Are any of us entitled to a new movement that evinces more depth and more engagement on more levels? We are not. But to the extent that one seed may be put into place (and with the hope that the seed may grow), I will say that what we need is to move upwards, towards some kind of affirmation, rather than towards new and greater levels of oblivion (born, more often than not, from obliviousness). Those who have inherited money often inherit nothing from history; those who have to create their own lives may create something worthy to be inherited, that has consonance with the more developed moments in art’s history. In this context, the important thing is that nothing is to be closed, and what is created is a mystery that each artist must resolve for him or herself. No one should be entitled to anything but the right to create; the world owes none of us anything, not even this. That the right to create should be earned is something that post-modernity has completely lost touch with; that material wealth is, itself, a red herring where the arts are concerned is something that needs to be looked into. But if something is to rise, and shortly, from the ashes of a fading post-modern regime, let’s hope that when/if we have earned our places, it is because we know that in art, there is no way to earn anything but through intense and devoted labor.

Hot chocolate, the moon and the stars! On Wednesday, December 16, the fifth graders were lucky to have a visit from the Gloucester Area Astronomy Club (http://www.gaac.us). With the help of our expert guests and several high-powered telescopes, we were able to view and identify stars, star clusters, and even the International Space Station! (NASA = Spot the Station - http://spotthestation.nasa.gov/sightings/view.cfm?country=United_States&region=Massachusetts&city=Gloucester#.VnIAtxaDhUQ) The conditions were perfect as the clouds held off until after our viewing. A BIG thank you to the GAAC for supporting us in our exploration of the night sky!

I’ve long been quite sympathetic towards the relationship between Buddhism and Science within modernity. The logical conclusion between the two fields of inquiry is non-theism. I don’t have a problem with this per se……
What I’m saying as a Christian Gnostic is that humanity is in a compromised situation and this ‘fallen’ condition precludes our knowing the truth about god. This isn’t an excuse to espouse any theological view; theology has to be premised on coherent thought……
I’m in the studio finishing recording, ‘4-songs about god in e-flat minor,’ so I won’t be posting as frequently….
Riffin’ off Scott Preston’s blog post on Neoliberalism. I’ll add a diagram below of Wilber’s quadrant model which depicts the four modes of operation for humanity: the upper left is interior of I; the lower left is interior of we; the upper right is exterior of I, and the lower right is exterior of we. So individuals consciousness, collective interiors ( shared consciousness), exteriors living spaces of the individual and collective life systems of cultures.
I’d like to unpack this from a Christian Gnostic perspective; although admittedly, an alternative one at that and admittedly one which is a tad clumsy. Now it may be that this universe is inherently damned and irredeemable from this cosmologies perspective, but here I’m going to offer a Tantric take on Christian Gnosticism. The basic idea of Tantra is to take that which is considered vile and evil and flip it upside down and work with those energies for the end-goal of enlightenment. Sex was generally held to be sinful in religious antiquity but the Tantras’ turned this upside down and converted the energies towards enlightenment, and I think the same idea can be implemented upon culture. And this is is what I think The Sabbatean/Frankist Gnostics are getting at and are up to when they say the culture has to be made evil to attain enlightenment. It is the same idea, I think, but implemented on the cultural level via the notion of a group of people teaching humanity to learn about perfection; yes, that would be Judaic ideology in general, that’s why the Jews were chosen; there are utilities and purpose to it and it wasn’t about ethnicity per se.
Now, I’m not saying this is fact but offering up a hypothetical that tries to make sense of all this madness. Maybe The Plemora, Sofia and The Kristo’s will use The Demiurge to teach humanity the efficacy of goodness over evil? Because certainly these NeoLiberals from The Chicago School who were Jewish and perhaps knew of these things knew they had to make society evil which would lead to the devastation of nature; and this, indeed, is what neoliberalism has done — as Mr. Preston’s blog post points out. But the main point for these Jews and for us is to teach us what evil looks like so we can learn from it and overcome it.
We can see that neoliberalism ushered in a culture of me first narcissism inculcated especially within the entertainment and sports complex; it’s a culture of me first hedonism where city streets are laden with garbage; where we practice alienation by everyone exploiting everyone in every imaginable way in a Darwinian food fight for the survival of the fittest over who can have the most money earned by the most egregious means possible. This is a mafia ethos–my power drive of the ego which will only extend empathy to my blood kin and society and nature be damned! And this is exactly what’s happening under this system. Trump encapsulates this ethos and IMO, it’s no mere coincidence that his administration is the most Jewish in history.
Now, where is this all heading? A new Integral Age? The evacuation via light photon processes interacting with human DNA to ‘lift’ some via ascension into the next dimension and this earth be damned?
These are the two hypothesis of what’s happening here from an alternative spiritual perspective. Of course, the wild card here is 3-dimensional players such as The Anunnaki and The Lemurian’s; what their role and influence in these shenanigans are definitely hard to gauge…
I’ve been ranting against The Frankfurt Schools Marxist Multiculturalism over the past month and there is an important caveat which needs to be understood. We are right to criticize postmodernisms deficiencies as far as its falling into relativism but it’s a serious error to dismiss what the postmodernists got right: the deconstruction of archaic myth.
The solution to the deficiency of late post-modernity is not to regress back into archaic mythological modes of cognition. That would be invoking pre-rational insanity to once again take the reigns of power i.e. the neocons as one example………….
What we are looking for and should be aiming for is a POST-post modernity; one which understands that there are accurate truth claims notwithstanding the myth of the given (post-modernities deconstruction of modernity)and that religiosity does have a proper function in a post-post-modern culture–it’s simply not a literal religious interpretation of an archaic book!
The way past the confusion of late post-modernity is to keep the arrow moving to the right and not turn it around and aim it back to the premodern, yet that is what many are attempting to do. And BTW: the picture on the right is not accurate or is only accurate in depicting late postmodernity.
And No, Molyneux, the solution to the welfare state is not archaic notions of charity! Damn it! Fucking wake up!
But the thing he omits is the unmerited wealth of the new oligarchs in an economy modeled on a casino! The ‘I’ll go to bed a millionaire and wake up a billionaire ethos!’
Strange, indeed! Meanwhile, N.A. would rather fight endless wars of aggression than build our new green infrastructure:(
Justin Trudeau says Assad should be removed from power by foreign nations! What the fuck! Okay, then, by the somewhat same logic I can then say Trudeau should be removed from power because he’s not qualified to run the country as a high school drama teacher! And by his logic, I SHOULD be able to remove him because I think he’s not qualified!
How did we get to this? How did we get to a place wherein foreign nations get to dictate by force who governs other countries especially when they are not directly involved in aggressive acts of war against another country. By this measure, we should be attacking Saudi Arabia for its aggressive war against Yemen!
Jian got punk’ed by The Frankfurt School Marxist’s but still wants to sing from their playbook! The fact of the matter is that until Israel, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Mexico and countless other countries start reciprocating person per person in free and protected human rights within the exchange of persons then it’s all still manipulative bullshit brought to you by The Rockefeller, Rothschild legacy. And no, I’m not an alt-righter; but rather a pro truther devoid of bullshit! And please don’t compartmentalize this issue: what’s come from mass immigration for corporations, banks, oil companies, and The Greater Israel Project is massive inflation; unaffordable cities; unbreathable air; a lifetime of debt bondage; the reduction of a human being to wallet status; the dismembering of truth into relative insanities; the transfer of the ‘wealth of the commons’ into the hands of about 6000 oligarchs; a society premised on a Social Darwinist feeding frenzy wherein the majority now get a lifetime of gig work with The Hunger Games as retirement; not to mention the alienation of the person which the artist known as Jian correctly diagnoses.
Okay, this is going to be a list of all the things that are going to cause collapse according to The Chicago School NeoLiberals and The Frankfurt School Multiculturalists:
-society will collapse if we make all natural drugs legal and teach responsible use of the substances! B.S.!
-society will collapse if the sports and entertainment complex makes reasonable amounts of money instead of obscene amounts. B.S.!
There is really only one party in Canada. The Liberals are now Illiberal and The Conservatives don’t conserve or practice conservation; the fact of the matter is they both employ and enact neoliberal economics which I’ve argued is a type of economic fascism.
So where is the opposition to this monoculture? Ah, yes, within the controlled opposition of the NDP with its Frankfurt School Leap Manifesto! This is, of course, the duopoly playbook of The Chicago School of Economics, combined with the cultural aspects of The Frankfurt School, and low and behold, when we analyze society from this lens we see that this is exactly what western culture looks like today and I argue on this site that that is no mere coincidence; and yes, this society now combines the worst elements of right and left-wing ideology! That is to say, Marxism without the ‘good parts’ and capitalism without liberty or a surveillance culture premised on the notion of corporate empire.
To be sure, there are a few propositions within the Manifesto that are reasonably sound such as some type of Guaranteed Income, but this would need to be enacted with the dismantling of the social welfare bureaucracy and we all know this will never happen; not to mention that any type of Guaranteed Income has to be implemented with sound ecological practices and education which teaches the best aspects of human potential–and we all know this will never happen, either.
This Manifesto is in denial about energy and suffers from magical thinking about the relationship between energy and economy. The fact of the matter is that there is not even 1- 500 person town in Canada that exists wherein all people use clean non-polluting high tech energies, yet we are told the whole country will somehow be able to enact this ethos! I say show me the money first! Let’s see this ‘test town’! And I’m not talking about Lasqueti Island; it would have to be far more technical than that and not premised on only the wealthy having access to land and tech.
The biggest flaw in this Manifesto is the idea that the capitalists are simply going to lay down and agree to give up their largely unmerited wealth garnered from the global casino in which they’ve enacted via neoliberalism. Nope, The Global Commons Society is a far more realistic way forward as it captures the essence of the issue which is scale combined with giving as many people as much choice as possible. The fact of the matter is that capitalism became unsustainable sometime around 1950 or when about 2-billion people bought into the system, and in fact, this is when this particular system should have been capped.

Today was COLD, WET and WINDY! but we still caught some fish. Water was extremly high so we took a while getting bait. Once that was done we hit the first spot. Started out with a nice 20 pounder. The next spot produced the big fish for the day which was 26 pounds. Ended up the day heading back down river to try and find some stripers but it didn't happen. Tough day but still a success.
Went hunting after we got done fishing and I had wore just about all my warm clothes while we fished so I didn't want to were them in the woods. I froze on the stand after freezen all day on the water...not fun!

Abstract: A power-law graph is any graph G = (V,E), whose degree distribution follows a power law i.e. the number of vertices in the graph with degree i, yi, is proportional to i^{-beta}: y_i is proportional to i^{-beta}. In this paper, we provide information-theoretic lower bounds on the sample complexity of learning such power-law graphical models i.e. graphical models whose Markov graph obeys the power law. In addition, we briefly revisit some existing state of the art estimators, and explicitly derive their sample complexity for power-law graphs.

February 2011 Horoscope Scorpio, free Monthly Horoscope for February 2011 and Scorpio Astrology Forecast for the month ahead.
Scorpio (the Scorpion) certainly will be a favourite of the year of White Metal Rabbit 2011, but it doesn't mean that he/she will get favourable opportunities and have prosperous moments only. It goes without saying that Scorpio will need self-possession, abilities of prompt response to unexpected situations and of taking strong stand against the partners and colleagues. From the very beginning of the month there will be the situations which will demand drastic solutions, and Scorpio must be ready for active choice which may turn out an important event for his/her future.
Most of February time Scorpio will spend on contact making with partners, he/she will make the acquaintance and communicate with other people actively. Scorpio-office worker will be engaged in the work connected with agitation, advertising campaigns, social events organization on the direct boss' task. Communication will become Scorpio's base for many things and actions, that's why conflicts and confrontations are possible in such infirm and changeable sphere as colleagues and partners relations. They will have been resolved only by the end of February, but it will be possible only with active Scorpio's involvement in peacemaking process. The February financial sphere will be stable more or less, but the planetary unit just wants to warn about the necessity to do business rationally, without spending money on the luxuries and entertainments, because difficult business, which will require financial injections, is waiting ahead. If Scorpio is busy with activities intended for real estate operations or investment business, the end of February will bring the stable inflows of sizable profit into Scorpio's budget. But in the third February decade Scorpio should mind the hasty investments to avoid risks of considerable part of savings loss.
The Scorpio's ambitions may become a source of domestic altercations, and by an unlucky train of events these altercations may lead to the complete break-off with a beloved person. Scorpio will have to manage his/her haughty manners and to think more of partner's feelings and wishes, than of his/her own. Energy and activeness should be put on the domestic cares, which are waiting for it. In February Scorpio may start redecoration works or help to solve relatives' money problems.

A new analysis by Josh Rauh at Stanford University's Hoover Institution says state and local governments’ collective unfunded pension liabilities are actually about three times the amount they claim. Rauh, a finance professor who has long been a critic of public pension accounting, arrived at his figure by assigning pension plans a much lower assumed investment rate of return.
Pension plans in 2015 collectively reported about $1.3 trillion in unfunded liabilities. In other words, they have about 72 percent of the assets they need to meet their estimated total liabilities. That figure assumes plans will earn an average of 7.4 percent each year on their investments.
Rauh, pointing to the wild swings of the stock market and the fact that pensions are putting more of their assets into volatile, alternative investments, says that assumption is too risky. He argues it's more responsible to consider a rate of return closer to what long-term bonds earn: slightly less than 3 percent. Under those assumptions, Rauh says unfunded U.S. public pension liabilities would roughly triple to $3.8 trillion, or less than half-funded.
The Takeaway: Rauh is arguing for accounting responsibility. And to be sure, the underwhelming returns of pension plans over the last two years bolster his case. Several pension plans have already acknowledged that their investment return assumptions likely won’t hold up in the long term and have lowered their assumed rates of return to 7 or 6.5 percent. But to drastically lower return assumptions would be devastating for governments and impair their ability to provide services to constituents.
Rauh even cites those consequences in his research. In the worst example, Illinois in 2015 put a whopping 11 percent of its own revenue into its pension plan. Even though that's a far higher share than other states, Illinois' payment was still short -- it actually needed to contribute more than 16 percent. Under Rauh’s approach, Illinois would have to contribute more than 23 percent of its revenue to avoid a rise in liabilities. That would dwarf education spending and make pensions second only to Medicaid as the state’s highest single expense.
On the heels of Connecticut’s multiple downgrades, its capital city also took a credit hit this week. S&P Global Ratings flagged Hartford's reliance on state aid as a major concern when it downgraded the city's credit rating to one notch above junk status. Half of Hartford's $612 million budget for the next fiscal year relies on state funding.
The downgrade was based on “the heightened uncertainty” as to whether the state could boost financial aid or otherwise lend the necessary support to prevent Hartford from further fiscal deterioration. Connecticut has suffered under chronic budget shortfalls and is facing a more than $2 billion deficit for the next two years.
Adding to rating agencies' concerns was Mayor Luke Bronin’s open acknowledgment this month that his office is seeking advice from municipal bankruptcy lawyers. “While a bankruptcy filing remains distant, in our opinion, by raising the possibility, we believe that elected officials are seeking to better understand the legal qualifications, process and consequences associated with this action if there is no budgetary support at the state level,” wrote S&P's Victor Medeiros and Geoffrey Buswick.
The Takeaway: Connecticut’s budget crisis will likely be solved, in part, on the backs of local governments. In his proposed budget, Gov. Dannel Malloy would make local governments pick up a third of teacher retirement contributions (a collective $400 million alone for the upcoming fiscal year). For already dire places like Hartford, such an action would push local officials into new territory: Officials are already less gun shy about publicly discussing the “B” word.
While bankruptcy is still everybody’s last choice, the experience in places such as Detroit; Central Falls, R.I.; multiple cities in California; and most recently Puerto Rico; have seemingly made the process less taboo.
State officials know that maintaining their rainy day funds aren’t just important for the next fiscal downturn, but also for their credit rating. But new research by the Pew Charitable Trusts says that correlation has long confused policymakers. After all, if the reserves are not to be used in times of fiscal stress, what are they for?
The research found that even in states with the agencies’ highest rating (triple-A), policymakers often are unsure about how best to manage their rainy day funds to earn or keep high credit ratings. “As a result,” the report says, “some state officials are reluctant to tap reserves even during recessions for fear of a ratings downgrade.”
But the report also found that ratings agencies don’t automatically punish a government for drawing upon its reserves. If the action fits within what credit ratings agencies consider prudent fiscal policy, the report says, it won't factor into a downgrade.
The Takeaway: So what is prudent fiscal policy where rainy day funds are concerned? According to Pew, it's:
Defining rainy day funds savings goals and codifying them so they aren’t subject to the whims of changing administrating and legislatures; Considering a state’s revenue volatility and the business cycle when designing a fund’s deposits, withdrawals and savings targets, and; Basing the decision to tap rainy day funds on a state’s fiscal situation, “withdrawing money as appropriate during budget crises but resuming deposits when economic and fiscal conditions improve.” Indeed, establishing prudent fiscal policy for rainy day reserves can help boost a credit rating and ultimately save taxpayer money. For example, in early 2015, Fitch Ratings upgraded California to A+ in part because of the state’s newly institutionalized savings policy and bolstered reserves. Following the upgrade, the state refinanced $1 billion in bonds, saving taxpayers nearly $200 million in debt service costs.
Hurricane Maria brought unprecedented devastation to Puerto Rico, and the majority of residents are still without power. Nevertheless, with new federal aid and some of the world’s top technology leaders getting involved, the hope for a better tomorrow is now returning.
In a hurricane season filled with unprecedented damage, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands continue to have the greatest amount of ongoing struggles and widespread impacts. Puerto Rico is now the largest blackout in U.S. history, with 75 percent of the island still without power, 36 days after Hurricane Maria struck the island.
Never before has our country faced three back-to-back hurricanes that so severely impacted both people and also crippled critical infrastructure in the way that Harvey, Irma and Maria hammered Texas, Florida and Puerto Rico along with the U.S. Virgin Islands.
Despite plenty of criticism for unequal hurricane relief efforts, much has been done by FEMA and hundreds of other public- and private-sector groups to help Puerto Rico regain their footing. Still, Puerto Rican officials say it could take up to six months before its power grid is fully repaired and restored.
As aid groups continue to struggle to get supplies to help residents in need, many groups continue to focus on restoring power and cell service, especially in remote areas.
The New York Times focused on a perfect storm of failures and weeks without lights. “Thirty days after the storm, I see very little progress,” said Eduardo Bhatia, an opposition senator who in 2014 wrote an energy reform law. He added, “I don’t see the boots on the field doing the work, and that is a tragedy.”
What’s the causing these delays? The NY Times article continues: “After major storms, power companies typically rely on mutual aid agreements to get electricity restored. Outside companies send thousands of workers, and electric companies pay for the service with funds from FEMA.
Such agreements are “absolutely critical,” said Devon Streit, the deputy assistant secretary for infrastructure security at the Department of Energy, which is helping to coordinate the restoration of power. But in this instance, some companies were concerned about getting paid, she said, because the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, known as PREPA, had filed for bankruptcy protection in July after defaulting on $9 billion in debt.”
This article from The Washington Post illustrates the ongoing challenges faced by Puerto Rico as the pictures tell a remarkable story that continues.
“Workers and tools must be flown to the island. Any heavy equipment, such as bucket trucks, transformers and wires, must be transported on ships.
When the workers and equipment arrive, the next challenge is repairing downed lines among the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA)’s 2,478 miles of transmission lines, clearing debris from roads, and providing food and water to residents. …
On Oct. 19, Whitefish Energy, a Whitefish, Mont.-based energy company, announced it signed a $300 million contract with PREPA to repair and reconstruct large portions of the electrical infrastructure.
One of the huge challenges facing the recovery is that underfunding and poor state of the Prep-owned power plants prior to Hurricane Maria. Reports last year described the electrical grid to be “running on fumes,” in a state of disrepair and needing about $4 billion to bring systems up to the proper state.
Of course, without power, almost every other aspect of improving critical infrastructure is negatively impacted.
But despite all of this bad news, is there finally light at the end of the long tunnel for Puerto Rico?
The big news this week is that more money is finally on the way. “President Donald Trump signed a $36.5 billion emergency aid measure on Thursday to refill disaster accounts, provide a cash infusion to Puerto Rico and bail out the federal flood insurance program. …
The current measure would permit FEMA to allocate up to $5 billion to assist Puerto Rico's central government and various municipalities dealing with a cash crisis.”
This Brookings Institute blog also brings hope by pointing to the reality that disasters can lead to unexpected and rapid technology innovation.
Excerpt: “We know that many diesel generators — the current technology of choice for backup power in many critical facilities — failed in Puerto Rico, as they have in all modern disasters, from the New York City blackout, to Katrina, Sandy, Harvey, Irma, and now Maria. They flood, or simply stop, when the fuel is gone.
Into this dangerous power breach comes Elon Musk, the peripatetic disruptor of multiple industries, from autos to space travel, and now the electric power sector. He has already started sending Tesla batteries to Puerto Rico, to be installed with solar as an emergency measure to provide power to critical facilities. He’s not the only one.
Sonnen, a German company with manufacturing facilities in the United States, is installing solar and storage systems in Puerto Rico at emergency shelters. Their systems can provide critical power for cell phones, lights and refrigeration. …”
TheVerge.com describes how a casual comment on Twitter by Tesla CEO Elon Musk about rebuilding Puerto Rico’s power grid using solar technology was quickly responded to by the island’s governor with the comment: “Let’s talk.”
Related articles on rebuilding using the latest smart grid technology were written by Fastcompany.com, Technologyreview.com and Barrons.com. Indeed, many Silicon Valley companies want to help rebuild Puerto Rico.
Summing up the opportunity very well, Barrons.com proclaims: “It’s time to transform Puerto Rico’s power grid. Hurricane Maria's damage affords the U.S. government an opportunity to upgrade the island’s power supply with a focus on renewables. …”
However, all of this costs money and time, and it is not clear where that long-term investment will come from. In the short term,Tesla has delivered solar power to Puerto Rico children's hospital and other similar examples of critical need following Hurricane Maria.
As the hurricane restoration and rebuilding process continues to unfold in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, there are many excellent resources to take advantage of from The Council of State Governments (COSG) Knowledge Center.
COSG gives a longer-term perspective on government issues and solutions than found most in IT literature and reference policy areas, such as elections under critical infrastructure and potential disruptions and disasters. Here is a sample of some of the excellent research that can provide information actions on these topics:
"Critical Infrastructure ... and Still Critically Underfunded: What Comes Next for Securing U.S. Elections?"
Other excellent resources come from Brookings on how Puerto Rico’s recovery requires a sustained federal commitment, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) on how Puerto Rico’s utility contracting has sparked new probes and how the Jones Act has delayed delivery of much-needed supplies.
There are also quite a few articles covering how bond funds are selling Puerto Rico bonds and investors were exiting Puerto Rico in the wake of recent hurricanes.
“Since both U.S. territories had such a low financial capacity to deal with a major disaster in the first place, it will take them much longer to rebuild than Houston and the Florida Keys, which were also hit by major hurricanes this year. ‘It's going to easily be a decade,’ says Deserai Crow, a disaster recovery expert at the University of Colorado Denver.
That's in part due to the level of devastation brought by the hurricanes. Puerto Rico's entire electric grid was severely damaged following Hurricane Maria in September, leaving the whole island without power and, in most cases, a working water and sewer system. Federal officials say it could take months before power is restored there.
Maria also ravaged St. Croix, the largest of the U.S. Virgin Islands, while St. John and St. Thomas were pummeled by Hurricane Irma just 14 days earlier. All three islands are facing widespread power outages as well. Although, running water is expected to return this weekend.”
Finally, Route Fifty offered some interesting insights on how the Trump administration holds all the cards on Puerto Rico’s recovery efforts. Here’s an excerpt: In terms of relief, Puerto Rico still remains in the “response phase” ensuring public safety and the meeting of critical needs like water, sewer, power, communication, mobility, and trade….
Once the short-term response phase is finished, the long-term “recovery phase” led by FEMA will begin bringing action plans and the prioritization of projects. …
Intergovernmental cooperation, as well as communication with the private sector and NGOs, is improving in Puerto Rico, and that could make or break resilient recovery. Disaster politics could stymie it.
There are several opportunities to participate in free briefings that offer helpful insights on hurricane disaster response in the coming weeks, and one of those is offered by Deloitte experts on Oct. 31, 2017 — which will likely be recorded for later use.
Participants will learn how tested strategies and effective practices can speed recovery from natural disasters and reinforce business continuity for the long term.
I plan to come back to this wider topic with another blog on the 2017 hurricanes and natural disaster response later this year, but I want to end this piece on a positive note.
Despite numerous ongoing challenges and many serious issues that remain in Puerto Rico, I am encouraged overall that the worst is behind Puerto Rico regarding Hurricane Maria response. There is light at the end of this dark tunnel.
My hope is that all of America can come together to make this very horrible situation that is facing our fellow citizens the impetus for a bipartisan rebuilding effort that truly helps Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to move forward for a better tomorrow.

2:17 pm they get up really fucking early to beat the crowd they will inevitably become. and before you even get started don't worry, the overly judgmental host said it for you, "getting a late start eh, ladies?" he mused as em and i dragged ourselves and our big sunglasses to a cozy table in the back of the cafe. to which i say, IT'S NOT BRUNCH IF IT HAPPENS BEFORE NOON, YOU ASSHOLES. you're not eating brunch at 930 in the morning, boo. you are straight up having BREAKFAST. don't be cute, just because you're still drunk and there's eggs on the table that doesn't mean you're eating brunch. i know you want an excuse to put vodka in your oj before the sun is even all the way up, and that excuse is just going to have to be "alcoholism" unless you wait until at least eleven-fucking-thirty. i hate being sneered at rolling into the jam spot with no underwear on under my sleeping pants just because the barista has already made 942 pots of coffee for all of the jerks who are totally doing sunday wrong. what is it about having a manfriend that catapults you bitches out of bed before the rooster even has his first latte? last thing i ever want to do after i get laid is get up. FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS. usually because i dislocated a hip and felt my spine slip out of alignment a couple times, but who gives a fuck about that. besides, isn't that the buttery shit about being in a goddamned relationship? that homeboy could just unstick his dick from where it glued itself to your back in the middle of the night and roll out to doughnut vault for a couple of buttermilk old fashioneds and the sunday times while you just lie there thinking about chlamydia!? WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF LISTENING TO YOUR STUPID PROBLEMS ALL THE TIME IF I STILL HAVE TO GET UP HELLA EARLY AND PUT SHOES ON TO GET BREAKFAST, BRO.
2:23 pm sometimes they eat across from each other without saying a motherfucking word for, like, seventeen real minutes. i'm like a gremlin, man: no direct sunlight. and no loud voices either, because mommy was out late having fun with your new "uncle" and her head hurts so please play quietly in your room until the sun goes down and this bromo seltzer kicks in. em and i were shown to a cozy little table tucked in a corner behind the NO. NOT TUCKED. THEY SAT US RIGHT IN FRONT OF AN ENORMOUS PLATE GLASS WINDOW ON A BEAUTIFUL, SUN-DRENCHED DAY. i could feel my horns and scales start to melt beneath my eating hoodie the minute we sat down. a couple of those "put a bird on it" type of people were sitting next to us: you know, a couple of thirty-year-old graphic designers who just finished a kickball match with thrifted dad sweaters and "woodworking" scars. i try to never make eye contact with anyone lest they think i want to exchange pleasantries with them, but i inconspicuously glanced over to see if what they were eating looked like i needed to copy it. they were sitting there in silence, both looking at their plates, the only sounds coming from the faint clink and scrape of fork against plate. "IS THAT THE CASSEROLE?!" em squawked in their direction, which prompted them to look up briefly then immediately look back down at their food. i have been to funerals more lively. this is why i can't be jealous of your relationship, dog. because sure, i would like someone else to pay my phone bill and put his jacket over puddles i need to walk through (that's how that works, amirite?) but if he doesn't have shit to say to me after six months WHAT IS THE GODDAMN POINT. i'ma need you to tell me the consistency of the last poop you took, bro. have you read any books lately? get yourself a pair of new shoes? talk to me about basketball statistics, or about how you dressed up like captain america when you went to see the new movie last weekend. of course i love xbox! i am absolutely interested in that pop punk grindcore string quartet show you're going to! comfortable silence is only comfortable when nosy bitches ain't watching our every move. DON'T MAKE ME WRITE YOU A SCRIPT. (omg, doing that.)
2:42 pm deciding what to order, vs deciding what your boyfriend should order and allow you to pick off his plate, is a really stressful decision. i like to order one of everything. i mean shit, it's three in the afternoon and i'm dehydrated and full of unbuffered aspirin: BRING ME ALL OF THE FOODS. i decided that i needed a ginger beer, a giant water, a chai latte, and a neat vodka. em ordered coffee, and we asked for a plate of chocolate croissants because it's hard to know what you want to eat when you aren't already eating something. "i'm getting the casserole," i announced confidently, to no one, spitting tiny croissant flakes everywhere. "i'm going to get the griddle cakes," em replied, with an equal amount of certainty and assuredness. "THE CASSEROLE HAS TWO MEATS, BRO," i countered, and it was settled: we would both be ordering the breakfast casserole. i looked around for the waitress, convinced she'd be proud of our decisiveness so close to the end of her shift. and then i realized the couple on our left was having a fight. i love watching people in love argue about dumb shit, because listening to bitches yell at each other about dirty socks or whatever makes me feel way better about being a lonely, hateful spinster. you broads need to try it! next time you're feeling like the dogshit scraped off the bottom of your ex-boyfriend's timberland, take yourself on a date to red lobster and ask the hostess to seat you next to two people who have obviously been together for a while. then put that book you're pretending to read away and enjoy your cheddar biscuits, soothed by the lullaby of other people's misery.
first they were bitching about laundry (snoozapalooza) and then it was as if someone lit a fucking match. "WHY WOULD YOU GET THE CHILAQUILES IF I SAID YOU SHOULD GET THE OMELET SO I CAN SPLIT IT." the waitress stood by uncomfortably while i halted my selection of homely dudes on emily's tinder to devote my full attention to this woman's imminent meltdown. she shout-talked him down every single one of his substitute while he helplessly scoured the menu for something as delicious as those chilaquiles were going to be, a single bead of sweat rolling down his forehead as he withered under her gaze. homie tried to defend himself, to no avail; girlfriend even rebuffed his compromise offer of scrambled eggs and bacon. he wanted anything other than that goddamned omelet, which would surely arrive at the table tasting like fear and sprinkled with his dignity. finally he sighed and ordered it, hold the scallions, and slumped down in his chair sighing in defeat. "HE WANTS THE SCALLIONS ON THE SIDE," girlfriend yelled, and emily and i high-fived each other then went back to swiping left.
2:57 pm girls still do that thing where they fight to do something nice for a dude and even though he won't let her she keeps trying to do it anyway and when he eventually does it for himself we all are left feeling uncomfortable and dissatisfied. having grown bored with the tables on either side of us, i turned my attention to the happenings on the other side of the glass in sunny lincoln square. white people were lazily kicking soccer balls around barefoot (SON) and setting up picnic lunches in the melted piles of garbage masquerading as early spring grass. there was a young pair of lovebirds canoodling (ew) on a park bench directly across from us. carefully tucking hot sausage-wrapped bacon (word) and arugula and coddled eggs into my good cheek, i watched them spoon-feeding each other chocolate gelato and burned with envy. not because i would enjoy being awkwardly poked in the face with plastic cutlery, but BECAUSE GELATO. that shit is hella delicious. anyway, when they finished eating they decided to get on their tandem bike and head to the used vinyl store next to their favorite co-op, but NOT BEFORE THEY DISPOSED OF THOSE CUPS IN AN APPROPRIATE RECYCLING BIN. upon locating one, babygirl jumped at the chance to show old skinny jeans how into him she is by reaching out to collect his refuse, which he yanked just out of her reach. "my low self-esteem and inflated value of your worth in my life needs to show you that i care by carrying your empty cup approximately eighteen inches to your left!" she begged, although i am a terrible lipreader and might have missed a word or three. but he wouldn't make that tiniest of concessions, because everybody knows that once you let a woman recycle for you the next thing you know she's leaving tampons and bobby pins in your bathroom and taping cathy comics to your refrigerator. they wrestled back and forth over this little scrap of plastic for two real minutes before he dragged her, sobbing while clinging desperately to the hem of his slender trousers, over to the bin. "kobe!" he whispered to himself as he banked it in. (i think? like i said, i suck at reading lips.)
4:12 pm going back to bed alone and sleeping until it's time to go to the game of thrones party you were invited to is perfectly reasonable when all you've done all day is: sat around with your sunglasses on inside texting yourself snippets of other people's conversations, purchased two "smart person books" at the book cellar, and drank half a bottle of walgreens wine while eavesdropping on the dude across the hall making loud-ass plans with his LARP-ing friends. THE DREAM, I AM LIVING IT. boyfriends: what's the point.

Hey. "Make that whore cum you stupid slut!" Sandra's Master shouted at me. 'What are you doing in there!?' Trina asked.
I made me freeze up. Ray stood, Amber before him, he pulled the pasties from her nipples and started to pull on them harder than the night before she almost fell over with the force hold her Don Ray smiled has she was held while he stretch and tugged on her nipples before slapping and biting hard on her tits this went on for five minutes before he finally reaching into a bag producing a viscous looking set of nipple clamps.
We both had the same sex drive - hyper drive. Then the text he had sent her all morning calling her the filthiest names and telling her what he would expect that night, the final instructions came late afternoon and she had rushed round preparing everything.
What the fuck. He watched as she arched her back off the table so he slowed it down and leaned down to her ear, "You may not cum yet my pet.
some snapping pictures, some recording videos. "you guys go ahead. "No, Dad. Neither of us ever said no to the other. Never again. I have no idea what color they are or what they suggestively reveal, but I can imagine.
She's been seen naked so many times by these folks it's just part of the job now but this this thing she'd going to do now this is different to anything she'd done before.
No I don't know a lot of Switzerland. But I do know that 40% of the people there are not religious. That might not mean they are atheist. But they don't participate in the holy crap you referred to.
Why must you immediately descend to the absurd? The discussion was over choices. If the woman choose to be involved in activities that makes babies is the baby then to be punished by murdering it?
Who knows may be she was also sleeping with someone else. I just hope that things work out for you and you find contentment and happiness
Love, hate, compassion and kindness aren't things humans made, they're traits humans have. Ditto morality.
The insurance person can't pay for your illness and a BMW at the same time. Guess who is really 'covered'.
The fact that he was willing to sell them something dispels the notion that he doesn't want to do business with gays.
Denying the unknown if foolish. One may speculate about everything, but, ultimately, no one knows for sure, one way or the other.
Exactly. Thus calling someone a Father of the Church doesn't imply or replace God as our Father as you originally asserted. And you having a biological father further refutes your point.
"People should be allowed to marry whomever they want to marry whether the person they want to marry is of the same sex as them, or the opposite."
False. The only folks who think people are born homosexual are those who are ignorant of the science of biology. There is no such thing as the science of "sexual orientation."
I agree with you. She was working there. She was aware of the climate and the consequences. However, since then it's been put in her head that because he was who he was, that she wouldn't deny him. That's why they're calling it an "abuse of power."
you are right it is not. however what is required and is included in their contract is conducting themselves is a manner that is consistent with the best interests of the league.
If I said Thor creates lightning bolts when he is angry, that is an explanation for lightenign bolts. Likewise, if I said that lightning bolts are caused when the clouds are angry, that is a nother explanation. You are free to call those an excuse, but it does attempt to show causality.
He would never do anything so vile. How on earth did you come to that conclusion by his mere interest in tits, preferably I presume, the ones big enough to hold in his hands.
He died physically, as you and I will. However, God is a Spirit and it is nothing for Him to die physically and then return physically. Being in physical form allowed him to take on our imperfections, and sin, then die, taking those things to the grave, then Resurrected, leaving those thing in the grave! This He did for You to bring you back to Him! There?s no greater Love!

California Pizza Kitchen has brought one of the most popular food trends of 2018 to its menu - cauliflower!
I have been seeing that delightful veggie pop up everywhere and I was so excited to try the new Cauliflower Pizza Crust at CPK.
“We are proud to be the first national restaurant brand to offer a cauliflower-based pizza crust that’s a craveable, gluten-free and lower-carb alternative to our classic hand-tossed pizza dough – a great option for guests with gluten sensitivities or those just looking for a clever way to sneak more vegetables into their day.” – Brian Sullivan, SVP of Culinary Innovation at CPK.
The best part about this crust is that you can order it with ANY CPK pizza. You can grab your go-to, favorite pizza toppings all while packing a veggie punch J. I’ll admit, I was a little hesitant! I mean, why mess with a good thing like pizza? Especially when the crust at CPK is so good! But I was proven wrong, this alternative to the traditional pizza crust really knocks it out of the park.
“Rich in nutrients and low in carbs, cauliflower is a powerhouse ingredient that continues to show its versatility and popularity as the star – not the side – of the plate. Now, it’s a delicious canvas for our creative California style pizzas!” said Sullivan.
If going to CPK with your friends or partner, just do what we did, grab one with Cauliflower Pizza Crust and one with CPK’s original crust. Then you get to try the best of both worlds.
Another amazing cauliflower dish now at California Pizza Kitchen is a popular small plate called Spicy Buffalo Cauliflower. It’s a tasty veggie spin on a buffalo wing. Fresh cauliflower florets battered and fried golden brown tossed in a delicious, housemade Siracha buffalo sauce. Such a good substitute for wings that I almost forgot I was eating a veggie! It also pairs well with their refreshing Spiked Cucumber cocktail. A cool and delectable drink after some spicy cauliflower goodness.
So make sure to head to your local CPK, where they are always innovative and dishing up delicious pizza!

Stainless steel is in the heart of our brand name, being taken as inspiration for the creation of our logo – construction of each character is done from a continuous stainless steel strip. Stainless steel is literally in everything we say, and we make our logo our only typographical face, our palette of colours and images.
Our slogan conveys the important role that stainless steel plays in our daily lives. It also communicates the incredible physical qualities of stainless steel, which literally lasts a lifetime. We should all be proud of what we do, with our slogan transmitting this idea to the people.
Water reutilization rate is among the best achieved by Brazilian steelmaking sector, around 95%. As regards the use of electric power, on the other hand, the Company has obtained significant reductions relative to energy consumption by means of its energy-efficiency improvement projects.
Ships in constant contact with seawater need to be made using stainless steel in order to fight oxidation. Aperam is the official supplier of stainless steel for the Kat Eastern Sailing Expedition, the latest adventure of the Shurmann family.
Used in exhaust systems (popularly known as exhaust pipes) an disk breaks, stainless steel features reduced thickness and weight of materials, ensuring greater durability and mechanical resistance.
There are countless advantages to using stainless steel tubing: educed thickness, easy to clean, lower maintenance cost, smooth finish, and a greater area of heat transfer inside.
Stainless steel is the ideal raw material for building surgery centers and other environments where avoiding the spread of bacteria is of the utmost importance. Stainless is excellent for the health of patients due being hypoallergenic, inert (which prevents contamination of the product with other substances), and easy to clean.
With stainless steel, restaurants are becoming more and more professional, offering absolute hygiene, food safety, and guaranteed quality.
Supplier of stainless steel for the production of 50-cent coins and the center portion of the 1-real coin, Aperam meets the high mint mark requirements.
Recommended around the world for processing, handling, and transporting food and drink, stainless steel has an extremely smooth surface which allows for a complete clean.
Stainless Steel allows for the thickness of tubing to be reduced due to the increased levels of mechanical resistance, in addition to resistance to oxidation at high temperatures.

In addition to all items belonging to remuneration, the Company offers a basket of important benefits that makes the difference in the pockets and to the lives of employees and their families.
By means of its Act Program – Global Action, Inclusion and Rehabilitation, Aperam promotes social inclusion through a different way and creates evolvement opportunities for all handicapped professionals from the market, in addition to taking back employees who have been absent from work, who are then qualified and prepared for the new routine. We prioritize safety in the role to be played, respecting the professional.
“A learning experience that has been changing my life”. Fabiana Alves de Azevedo Melo is a hearing impaired employee and an example of professional taken on by Aperam. “My ability to perform in the market has been expanded beyond measure. Nowadays I have only a few difficulties and I count on an experience that enables me to hold a position with Aperam, and that I’m sure, will yet lead to many other opportunities in the future”, she says. Prior to joining Aperam, she had as professional experience her previous work at a haberdashery shop, now she works in the Company’s Human Resources Department.
Preparation for the new journey that begins following retirement: this is the focus of lectures and workshops from Preparation for Retirement Program (Programa de Preparação para Aposentadoria). This is the way Aperam takes care of this important stage of people’s lives.
“We hear people say that no one should be worried about retirement, and that retirement is something that comes later on. I disagree. For me, retirement is something that you should start thinking about on your first work day, in spite of working for yourself or for a company. You have to think that at some point you are going to have to hand your position over to someone else”, Leonam Almeida – 35 year with Aperam (he retired in 2013).
We believe in synergy and in the collective force arising out of the meeting of different generations. Therefore, in 2015 we started some encounters for listening to the employees belonging to all generations that make up Aperam. The objective of this initiative is to favour a greater proximity between Company and employees in order to continue to evolve. During these encounters, the pride of belonging to Aperam and the desire to build a promising future, with synergy and exchange of knowledge among the generations, that’s the emphasis.
“The encounter was enriching both professionally and personally, as the sharing of experiences enables us to have a vision on how to deal and live with the different generations, absorbing the best of each of them for our growth and converting it into positive results”, Wellington Wagner Santos Oliveira, supervisor at Aperam South America.
Aperam’s remuneration policy is based on individual merit and performance from each employee. Besides the monthly remuneration, Aperam’s employees receive a return-from-vacation payment, in addition to counting on a Profit and Result Sharing Program (PLR), as an instrument of incentive and recognition for productivity.
Career refers to the professional path towards a desired position, meeting the employee’s individual objectives as well as Company’s objectives. At Aperam, employees have the opportunity to get to know and discuss with their immediate superior(s) what the professional growth opportunities are. There are the possibilities for taking part in competitive selection processes and competing for a new position.
At Aperam, the Y career evolution is used, in which the employee has opportunity to evolve both his technical and managerial careers. Concerning this evolvement, there are Career Paths, which are the evolvement/moving possibilities, both vertically and laterally.
Aperam’s Health & Life Program is one of the most complete in terms of coverage and scope from the steelmaking sector. It consists of a Health Assistance Plan, Dental Care Plan, Pharmaceutical Scheme and Social Welfare Service.
The Program “I Practise Health” has as its focus the promotion of health as a priority and as an asset of non-negotiable value. “I Practise Health” is divided in two major fronts of actions: health awareness and promotion programs, both for employees and their dependents; and a follow up on groups facing risk-to-health issues.
People have a clear view of their remuneration package, both for base payment and incentives, as well as for health and package of benefits.

Nevertheless, this intrigued Friend #3, Friend #5 and myself into going later that day. On entering the gym, I saw that the previous description was a pessimistic one. Although the space has a functional appearance, there is an impressive array of exercise machines. As well as the usual suspects of running machines, bikes and rowing machines for cardiovascular training; there are also some great strengthening machines, both individual and multi-station. A circuit training area, a space to use medicine balls and a free weights area complete the layout.
Most of my issues with this gym are with the people who visit and not so much the facilities itself. The gym itself is great. As a person that isn't overly into my fitness the price is great. The layout of the gym makes it easy to navigate, there is a bit of running between stairs to get to equipment, but most of what I would use is on the same floor. The classes are easy to book with the app and are plentiful.
Great gym with huge floor space and equipment. Free weights area has lots of benches and Dumbbells for even busy periods. Two racks with 20kg bars, one spare and two smith machines. Couple of half and ez bars too. Upstairs has loads of matrix cardio machines like treadmill, cross trainer, stepper and bikes. Trx suspension area and kettlebells from 4kg to 20kg. Studio for 40 classes a week.

In recent years, CoolSculpting has become one of the most popular nonsurgical alternatives to liposuction. This procedure utilizes cryolipolysis technology to freeze fat cells, causing them to wither and die. Your body will then safely remove these dead fat cells, leaving you with a more toned, sculpted figure. Dr. Fitzgerald can use CoolSculpting to remove targeted pockets of fat in many areas of your body, including your:
PureGym has redefined the industry with its affordable, high-quality and no-contract offering, and the success of this strategy is reflected in the company's continued growth. Launched in November 2009, in February this year, PureGym reached one million members - a milestone never previously achieved by a UK gym group - and in March opened its 200th site. In addition to the acquisition of Soho Gyms, PureGym plans to open at least 20 gyms a year - extending its position as the UK's leading gym operator. On average PureGym members pay around £20 per month compared to typical average prices in the market of around £40. Members benefit from fully equipped facilities and between 50 and 80 classes per week included in the monthly membership price.
Ultrasound energy (UltraShape). This type of treatment uses ultrasound energy to break down fat. It is the most time-intensive of the four types, taking approximately one hour per treatment session. Instead of hooking you up to a machine, a technician will move the device around manually. It uses a mechanical vibration to break down and destroy fat. This works on the abdomen and isn’t meant for other areas, Dr. Khetarpal says. There is no discomfort, she says.
While some of these problems still occur (notably the need for transfusions), experts say it's on a much smaller scale in the last few years. In a study presented in 2003 at an American Society of Plastic Surgeons conference in San Diego, researchers found that many such complications could be avoided if patients allowed more time to elapse between weight loss surgery and plastic surgery.
Every person’s body shape and structure is different. Hence, the treatment also varies from patient to patient. The number of sessions a patient as to undergo depends on several factors but the end goal always remain in achieving the desired body shape and tone for you. For instance, if you’re looking to remove just one pocket of fat, then one session of non-invasive treatment should be sufficient to take care of your needs. One session has been shown to reduce 20-25% of fat. On the contrary, if you have multiple pockets of fat that needs to be removed, it might take three to five treatment sessions administered over a six week long period.
Body sculpting treatments without surgery are being used for peripheral and cellulite reduction all around the world. These treatments have gained the spotlight in the eyes of both consumers and doctors alike. Apart from being non-invasive, it offers other benefits like no downtime, zero risk of infection, and no scars on the body due to the procedure.

Of course, the gym does get extremely busy at peak times, but as a 24-hour gym, you can plan your visits to avoid this. This serves as proof of the great value and variety of machines. A timetable of classes are available which range from Circuits to Spinning, and Kettle Bells to the ominously titled Military Body Blast. They are very accessible to view and reserve places on, as each member has their own account on the Pure Gym website. The classes are priced from £1 to £3 and there are up to 10 places available for each class. The smug sense of superiority when booking a 7:30am class is unbeatable. The reality of shivering down to the gym on a dark Winters' morning with a make-up free face and exchanging morning pleasantries with the milkman, is another matter entirely. Needless to say, I only attempted this once and will perhaps try it again in the Summer months.

This sparkling collection explores the impact of Richard Dawkins as scientist, rationalist, and one of the most important thinkers alive today. Specially commissioned pieces by leading figures in science, philosophy, literature, and the media, such as Daniel C. Dennett, Matt Ridley, Steven Pinker, Philip Pullman, and the Bishop of Oxford, highlight the breadth and range of Dawkins' influence on modern science and culture, from the gene's eye view of evolution to his energetic engagement in public debates on science, rationalism, and religion. The volume includes personal reminiscences and critical debate as well as accessible discussions of science - it provides a stimulating tribute to a remarkable intellectual.
Epigenetics can potentially revolutionize our understanding of the structure and behavior of biological life on Earth. It explains why mapping an organism's genetic code is not enough to determine how it develops or acts and shows how nurture combines with nature to engineer biological diversity. Surveying the twenty-year history of the field while also highlighting its latest findings and innovations, this volume provides a readily understandable introduction to the foundations of epigenetics. Nessa Carey, a leading epigenetics researcher, connects the field's arguments to such diverse phenomena as how ants and queen bees control their colonies; why tortoiseshell cats are always female; why some plants need cold weather before they can flower; and how our bodies age and develop disease. Reaching beyond biology, epigenetics now informs work on drug addiction, the long-term effects of famine, and the physical and psychological consequences of childhood trauma. Carey concludes with a discussion of the future directions for this research and its ability to improve human health and well-being.

Humans are extraordinary creatures, with the unique ability among animals to imitate and so copy from one another ideas, habits, skills, behaviours, inventions, songs, and stories. These are all memes, a term first coined by Richard Dawkins in 1976 in his book The Selfish Gene. Memes, like genes, are replicators, and this enthralling book is an investigation of whether this link between genes and memes can lead to important discoveries about the nature of the inner self. Confronting the deepest questions about our inner selves, with all our emotions, memories, beliefs, and decisions, Susan Blackmore makes a compelling case for the theory that the inner self is merely an illusion created by the memes for the sake of replication.
An anthology of diverse and inspiring pieces to browse and to treasure. It shows the many of the best scientists have displayed as much imagination and skill with the pen as in the laboratory.
Featuring an introduction by Stephen Jay Gould, "Genetics and the Origin of Species" presents the first edition of Dobzhansky's groundbreaking and now classic inquiry into what has emerged as the most important single area of scientific inquiry in the twentieth century: biological theory of evolution. Genetics and the Origin of Species went through three editions (1937, 1941, and 1951) in which the importance accorded natural selection changed radically.
A brilliant book celebrating improbability as the engine that drives life, by the acclaimed author of The Selfish Gene and The Blind Watchmaker. The human eye is so complex and works so precisely that surely, one might believe, its current shape and function must be the product of design. How could such an intricate object have come about by chance? Tackling this subject—in writing that the New York Times called "a masterpiece"—Richard Dawkins builds a carefully reasoned and lovingly illustrated argument for evolutionary adaptation as the mechanism for life on earth. The metaphor of Mount Improbable represents the combination of perfection and improbability that is epitomized in the seemingly "designed" complexity of living things. Dawkins skillfully guides the reader on a breathtaking journey through the mountain's passes and up its many peaks to demonstrate that following the improbable path to perfection takes time. Evocative illustrations accompany Dawkins's eloquent descriptions of extraordinary adaptations such as the teeming populations of figs, the intricate silken world of spiders, and the evolution of wings on the bodies of flightless animals. And through it all runs the thread of DNA, the molecule of life, responsible for its own destiny on an unending pilgrimage through time. Climbing Mount Improbable is a book of great impact and skill, written by the most prominent Darwinian of our age.
The best-selling author of The God Delusion and the artist of such award-winning graphic novels as Wizard and Glass address key scientific questions previously explained by rich mythologies, from the evolution of the first humans and the life cycle of stars to the principles of a rainbow and the origins of the universe. 150,000 first printing.

Communication is essential for a solid marriage, a healthy family, a successful soccer team and a profitable multi-national corporation. It is the mechanism that creates synergy when people work together to accomplish a goal.
There are over 23,000 books listed on Amazon on the topic of communication, so communication problems are not a secret. I will focus on one that hits close to home.
My wife tells me quite often, “It’s not what you say; it’s how you say it.” Sometimes, it is what I say that creates the problem but this article will deal with the “how.”
The concept of “it’s how you say it” applies to all communication. I will use a husband and wife as an example, but the principles apply equally to communicating with teenage children, with your kids’ teacher or with your boss at work.
Assuming that you know what you’re talking about and have the ability to express yourself adequately, communication will improve when you consider:
No matter what I am thinking or feeling, if the tone of my voice is not appropriate to my wife, my ability to communicate with her is drastically diminished. It helps me to take time to decompress from work or an intense situation before interacting with her so that my emotion doesn’t spill over to our conversation.
The volume of one’s voice is sometimes hard to gauge. Using the reaction of another can be a good indicator of your volume, but that could be too late. Consciously try to soften your voice, unless you are warning of danger.
The best way to engage another in a conversation is to begin with a smile. When we were dating, I would never have thought that scowling would be the best way to impress my future wife. The same applies to the message you send if you talk to another with crossed arms and a haughty look.
If the eyes are the windows of the soul, avoiding eye contact will give the impression that you are hiding something or that you simply are not interested. You might have something important to say but if you do not maintain eye contact, your message could be lost.
Sarcasm is the language of arrogance and/or ignorance. It can be used for humor sometimes, but you have to use caution. Sarcasm usually ends sincere communication.
Silence can be a useful communication tool. When I am pondering what has been said, it shows respect for the other person and their opinion. However, I know bosses that use silence to intimidate employees. In a marriage, the silent treatment never leads to resolution of a problem.
If I eloquently speak about a problem with my wife, but it is not the problem that she sees, I have failed. Being responsive to the other person is infinitely more important than eloquence.
You can’t fake “sincere” with people who know you. Often, you can’t fake it with anyone else. But, if we have the proper relationship with others, we can effectively communicate, even if we don’t express ourselves well.
The “how” is just as important as the “what” when communicating. Here is a simple example. We have all been complimented. We all know that the same words spoken by different people have very different meanings. Someone can say, “I love you” and it melts our heart. Others can say the same words and we know it is just hollow nonsense spoken only because it sounds nice.
As George Bernard Shaw said, “The single biggest problem in communication is the illusion that it has taken place.” The best way to overcome that illusion of communication with our spouse, child, neighbor or boss is to consider carefully not only what we want to say but how we say it and how we can increase the trust in our relationships. As a result, our relationships will not only survive, they will thrive.
I have just been looking for a free app which can be used to support learning spelling at home and I have come across an app called 'A+ Spelling Test'. I have uploaded a picture of the app icon to this blog so you can download the right one. Unfortunately, I have only been able to find this app on Apple and not Android. It does not mean that it does not exist or there isn't an equally useful app available - I just haven't found it this evening!
Then when you click on that list, you need to ensure that the word is typed in correctly in the box (stick to lowercase) and you record someone saying the word clearly. Add each word individually and click next to add the next one.
Once you have finished the list, children can complete the 'practice' where they hear the word said (as it has been recorded) and type out the word. They can play the 'unscramble' game where they hear the word said and are given the letters to rearrange. Then they can 'Ace It' or complete a 'Test'. Errors are brought up straight away and there is an option to retest all or retest mistakes as well as emailing the completed test.
In addition to this, it keeps track of how many times it has been tested and logs how many times the children have got it correct.
Its a fantastic free resource and provides an additional tool to learning spellings which can be hard to motivate children to do!

Is it a doily still when it's that thicker material used to cover larger things that old people have on fancy furniture? I have one of those for my dining table, it was my great aunts
Doesn't matter now. It was really nice, but the kid has fucked it all up. Most stains I've gotten out, but the purple paint is there to stay I sold the table that went to a couple weeks anyway, I didn't need a 78" table, even though it was a massive, sturdy, very well conditioned table.
might consider having a pillow or something else made out of it for your daughter when she's older, since no one really uses those things
If I'm going to bitch about the microwave in the office, it's gonna be because somebody re-heated fish or burned popcorn.
hahaha. Juggs I'm sure you can ask around, you must have a relative or friend of your mom's who does that sort of thing. I had a friend in Gainesville who did that but moved away
yeah I never really got why anyone wants to put their most precious delicate thing where its bound to get gravy, wine and everything else on it. Maybe it made sense 100 years ago but I don't get it.
I could throw it away and not give a shit Sure it's pretty and old, but I only have it because I kept her dining set and the ex wanted to keep it
One of the boss men just called me 3 times in a row. That was like 30 rings. I'm either not here or I'm ignoring you FFS
A PM and also a VP gets an invoice for outsourced production for a project. $1100. He didn't have that accounted for in his budget. Ignoring that it's a project management issue that he didn't budget for something he knows is a requirement in the contract, it's just the manner in which it was presented. External invoice vs. accounting just taking it from his budget. But he wanted me to look into the pricing, which I've done before and the now retired head of IT refused to acknowledge and cost us money:
Inhouse production: 12.5 cents a square foot charged to the client, plus a minimum of $120/hr of employee time for production and the contract for that piece of shit plotter is $10,000 a year.
We actually LOSE money by at least 50% by doing this shit inhouse. Why the fuck do they keep that $10k/yr contract and waste our time? :banghead: :facepalm:
only reason we kept the large format printer (we quit the plotter routine 5-7 yrs ago) was the expediency for the single sheet needs and its ability to scan in color. we did go through a period where there was little choice for outsource and it would take 2 days to deliver a print order. now we have a local source again, back to the single sheets. we reduced the cost of the large format drastically.
We have a separate plotter for small job needs, color boards for presentations, scanning, etc. This piece of shit is only for large/multiple sets going to bid. Which we barely use anymore because many clients are content with 11x17.
shit 90% of what i do is electronic now. 1 have a 42" TV and a 70" TV (their resolution kinda sucks vs a true monitor, but i work for cheap MFrs) to view my stuff. we still get hard copies, but only one set these days.

If you are having issues with your plumbing, you want to make sure that you are taking care of the problem in the best way possible. Sometimes, it may take a fair amount of advice for you to find the best answer to the problem, and the following tips are here to give you a great starting point.
Make sure everyone that lives in your house knows where to find and use the main water shut off valve in case there is a burst pipe emergency. This is especially important if you live in an area where your pipes may freeze. Take a moment to show your family members where the valve is and how to properly shut it off.
Do not use the liquid cleaning supplies that are designed to clear clogs. These cleaners are harmful and can damage your pipes as they clear the clog. Instead of using damaging liquids, use a plunger or a plumbing snake. These are much more effective and will not harm pipes.
Look closely at your toilets several times throughout the year. Check to see if there are any leaks that you may not have noticed; you can do this by placing five or six drops of food coloring in the tank. If there is a leak, the color will seep into the bowl within half an hour. This process will help you catch a small problem before it gets too out of control.
If your pipes are prone to freezing, let the water trickle continuously in at least one faucet during weather that is below freezing. This will minimize the chances that the pipes will freeze and leave you without water. If water is continually running through the pipes and trickling out of a faucet, the pipes are less likely to freeze.
Schedule one plumber to take care of all your issues in one single visit. It might be tempting to call up a plumber every time you have a small problem, but if you will save all the plumbing issues for one time, it can be helpful. It will allow you save the money for the repairs. Because most plumbers charge labor by the hour on top of a flat call rate, you can significantly reduce your bill by reducing the trips they make to your home.
Is your toilet leaking? Find out by putting https://www.wkbw.com/news/may-heat-wave-tips-to-cut-your-cooling-costs in the tank and then check the bowl later. If there is colored water in the bowl, the toilet has an internal leak. To fix an internal leak you can simply replace the tank's ball or flapper.
Before the cold season hits, check out the condition of your gutters on the roof of your house. Remove all debris, leaves and branches so that you can have a smooth flow of water and easy drainage. Caretaking in advance will help to prevent serious issues with plumbing down the road.
If you are having trouble removing a clean-out plug, there are two ways to do it. You can loosen the fitting around the plug using a hammer and chisel. You can also chisel into the plug.
If you are looking to get new piping in your home, try to stay away from copper ones. Copper tends to have problems, due to water and soil corrosion. It is also harder to install these kinds of pipes. Steel or lead pipes tend to offer the best quality and are the most durable.
Do not, under any circumstances, put lemons down your disposal. Although the lemon smell will give your disposal a great smell, its acid can corrode the metal parts in it. Instead, use products that are made specifically for this use. You can purchase these products at most hardware stores or wherever cleaning products are sold.
You may want to consider tankless water heaters if you want to conserve water in your home. These kind of water heaters heat up your water as soon as it is being used, so you are not wasting energy on keeping your water hot when it is not being used.
Watch out for decreased levels of intensity in the water flow in your bathroom. This can be a sign of calcium or mineral deposits disrupting water flow. If spotted early enough it may be possible to remedy this without having to replace the pipes.
If https://www.king5.com/article/life/home-garden/home-appreciation/5-types-of-costly-clogs-and-how-to-avoid-them/281-439901650 notice water dripping or signs of water staining on your walls, you should immediately turn off your water supply and notify a plumber. This could mean that you have some serious plumbing issues. Many issues related to this cause mildew and mold, as well as flooding.
A plumbing snake is an essential tool in any homeowner's tool box. Snakes can be used to unclog kitchen and bathrooms drains and toilets when clogged with hardened debris. They are useful as well for grabbing hold of items dropped down sink drains. Snakes come in a variety of sizes for home use and heavier-duty models can often be rented for bigger jobs.
Use a product like BioBen if you are planning to leave your system shut off for a few weeks. Water will still remain in the pipes and could start smelling because it is not moving. This type of product will keep the water from stagnating and from smelling too bad.
When it comes to plumbing an ounce of prevention is the best thing to prevent things from going haywire. In order to prevent clogging avoid doing things that would clog drains. Do not pour oil down the kitchen sink, and install hair catching filters in all your bath tubs. This will prevent a lot of unnecessary clogs.
If you are in need of plumbing fixtures, you should strongly consider going with brass ones. Brass models pose the advantages of durability and longevity. Also, the brass fixtures in general look nicer than their counterparts. You will be able to find these in any type of home repair store.
Avoid over-tightening water faucet handles. Use only enough pressure to stop the water from flowing and dripping from the faucet. Anything else is overkill and will quickly wear out the gaskets and washers inside those handles and cause leaking or the inability to stop the water from coming out of the faucet.
As you can see, plumbing is not rocket science. All you need to do is to find reliable sources that will give you great tips on addressing plumbing problems. The time you invest in educating yourself on plumbing issues will be time well-spent, because it will save you a lot of money in the long run.

People do business primarily with people they know and like. Resumes and cover letters alone are often too impersonal to convince employers to hire you.
Job listings tend to draw piles of applicants, which puts you in intense competition with many others. Networking makes you a recommended member of a much smaller pool.
The job you want may not be advertised at all. Networking leads to information and job leads, often before a formal job description is created or a job announced.
I think that if a survey is done on whats the percentage is of those who got there jobs as a result of there contacts, as oppose to those who didn't, i think the overwhelming percentage will be in favor of those who got there jobs or heard about it through there contacts. It is simple really. People help who they know. We are quick to distrust strangers. We talk to our family, friends and acquaintances more than we do to strangers. So of cause its from these people we hear things from. That's why the more people we know and communicate with, the better our changes of getting help when ever we need it.
Most people who secure jobs are through familiar contact. 95% of the jobs are given to insider or their family member, friend which made it harder for just your cv, cover letter to help you.
It's indeed true that most job are given based on familiarity rather than just ones resume and cover letter. But this is not fair and does not adhere to the labour principle of equal opportunity.
Are we just going to fold our hands and watch others destroy our country ?? Bevin Scott +23288779719
My perspective on this issue is based on real life experiences in the USA. Networking is an integral part of the job search. It is what takes you to the interview panel. Once you get to that stage then your work experience and academic background should be a deciding factor on the outcome of your interview. What i've experience in USA is that having a strong network creates a better platform for the individual to find a job .However, the basic entry level jobs are easy to come by with minimal networking. The upper management jobs are hard to get. This is usually based on very strong network and personal connections. Note the operative word here is "PERSONAL"
So regardless of where you reside , the same challenge exists. The situation is worst in Sierra Leone because of the high unemployment rate and too many job seekers chasing too few jobs.
I am interested working as Network Administrator. I have successfully completed Cisco Certify Network Associate (CCNA) from Institute of Public Administration and Management in the year 2010. I am patiently waiting for positive response.
I am in search of a job, any sustainable one thou i am not too connected. I do rely on adverts and announcements but i tell u guys with several applications, i am still hoping to have a headway bcos God is my only "sababu"
It takes only a manage who dose not want to succeed that will employ a person base on connection or familiarity.
However, if you want to hit your target and produce the desire result you will search for the competent person to fill vacant post.
The fact is, it's a common practice in our society and that is why some people always fail and then blame others for their failure.

London, which will host the 2012 Olympics, is the world's #1 tourist location. But site selection for the Olympics has more to do with power politics in the Machiavellian sense than with popularity. Madrid, the final stop for the IOC before it makes its decision, has been a candidate before and has an outstanding plan for the games. Powerful sports marketing interests in Britain, France and Germany have voiced tacit support for the Madrid bid. But the economics of sports marketing in a new tight money global economy may raise concerns that back-to-back Olympics in Europe will not play well elsewhere in the world. For its part, Madrid has a "mother country" problem in the New World, being part of the Old World that, along with Italy and the Vatican, did not see fit to give South America, now with the world's largest Roman Catholic population, a cardinal until 1905. Then too, security issues loom; although Spain recently captured leaders of the fut 16 coins

﻿ During Iron Banner, I collected too many things on my titan, and Plan C was deleted from the mailbox. Moral: keep a few open slots in your mailbox. :( Each character has their own Vision of Confluence, Icebreaker, and Gjallarhorn. I would probably have done this for other weapons, but using bungie.net to move items around makes it less necessary to have character-specific items. My wife hates Destiny. You're probably wondering how it's possible, to spend that much time in a game while still maintaining a healthy lifestyle. But, that depends on your definition of "healthy."I did the math. Here's the breakdown:About 4700 hours have passed since the game was released, so comphermc has spent roughly 25 percent of his life playing Destiny.This means that he averages about six hours of gameplay per day, without taking a day off. So, if he took weekends off, this would be the equivalent of a full-time job.According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the average American gets about 507 minutes of sleep per day and spends about two hours preparing and consuming meals. After sleep, eating, and Destiny comphermc has just under eight hours left in the day for work, family, friends, and other interests.Most wives probably wouldn't stand for this, but it sounds like she's got her own obsession. Here's comphermc: My wife is a teacher who binge-watches Netflix. I won't say I haven't gotten in trouble a few times, but she is usually pretty busy with school stuff and/or whatever show she's currently obsessed with. Surprisingly enough, several hardcore Destiny Final Fantasy XIV players commented on comphermc's post, revealing that they too have logged around 1200 hours. In fact, a user named BeefaloCL has about 1500 in-game hours.Crazy.Whenever I see reports like this, the comments are filled with people who liberally use phrases like "what a loser" and "get a job," but I hope we can avoid that stuff with comphermc (and anyone http://www.ffxivmall.com else, actually).Comphermc loves Destiny, so he's playing Destiny. We don?t know anything about his personal life or his work situation, so lets not judge.Comphermc seems like a dude who has some extra time and wants to spend it playing a game. I'm cool with that.Batman: Arkham Knight's Harley Quinn DLC Is Prequel. Batman: Arkham Knight pre-order customers will get a special Harley Quinn DLC pack.

A medieval town with the addition of a new town, Edinburgh is the perfect city to visit for a weekend.
If you decide to go during springtime, be sure to bundle up. I spent the first weekend of March here, and I arrived to a thick layer of snow and saw more snow fall during my three days there.
Patagonia Parka: If there’s anything I’ve learned about being cold, I feel best when my backside and bottom has some extra length to it! This parka is from last season, but I linked a similar one. The one linked has a hood with it, which I wish mine had!
J. Crew Jeans: I love these jeans because they’re thicker than your usual denim and keep you warm. They stay right in place, too! I’m 5’4″ and they hit at the perfect place on my ankles.
Boots: These are a classic pair of light brown, heeled boots that I have on in this photo that did keep me warm, but were NOT hiking-friendly for Arthur’s Seat (I’ll talk about this later).
Boots I DO suggest for snowy Edinburgh: I have these boots in the color “sand,” and they are insulated with sheep’s fur on the inside, keeping your feet SUPER warm without the need for thick socks. MAN, do I wish I would have had these packed with me! These have laces so you can loosen and tighten them as needed, which is nice if you need to tuck your pants into the boots. Also, the tracking on the bottom is excellent to keep you trekking through slick and snowy areas.
Beanie: I just have on the classic CC beanie, with a detachable pom on top. A layer around your ears is necessary to keep you from completely going crazy in the cold!
After settling into our hostel, we set out to explore Arthur’s Seat. This is a beautiful set of hills located in the “Old Town” of Edinburgh.
And this is why I mentioned earlier that I made a mistake with the boots I was wearing- they were NOT hiking material. I tried to hike as far as I could, but let’s just say I didn’t exactly make it to the top.
If you visit Edinburgh, don’t make the same mistake I did by packing the wrong shoes. Make sure you pack hiking shoes so you can make it to the top and experience the full outlook over the city! Partially up the hill will still give you a beautiful view, anyway.
If you’re able to visit when there’s snow around, I highly suggest gathering your family and friends and taking a few sledding boards. I saw so many families out pushing each other around and it looked like so much fun!
I also suggest taking a snack and possibly a hot drink with you. I stopped at a little cafe, Holyrood Coffee Shop, which was between our hostel and Arthur’s Seat.
I got a hot, fruit tea with a mixed berry scone. I loved this little place so much that I did go twice during my short stay!
After finishing our hike, my friends and I decided to do a little shopping to warm-up. We found the cutest vintage shop called W. Armstrong & Son. There are three locations in Edinburgh, and we made it to two of the three. I was so impressed with this shop because of the organization. They had a section of sweaters, blue jean jackets, leather jackets, kilts (of course), even wedding dresses and much more!
For dinner, we ate at The Last Drop. At this point, we were all so cold that we wanted to stay right around our hostel. I highly recommend staying at Budget Backpackers in Edinburgh because of the great location and great price (per person per night ranges anywhere from €9-€14).
The Last Drop has such a neat history behind it- it’s all about a young girl named Maggie who was on trial, hung, and then survived for 40 years after the hanging. The waiters here were very friendly and the restaurant provided a great atmosphere.
I had a lentil cottage pie, which was a lentil and vegetable pie topped with sweet potato and carrot mash, served with a side salad.
Side note: I’m not really sure why it was called a “cottage pie” because there definitely wasn’t cottage cheese in it- in case you were worried/grossed out!
I had the sticky toffee pudding, which was topped with hot toffee sauce and served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It was excellent!
To start the day, we began with breakfast at the Filling Station. I had french toast with fresh berries on top and a berry compote sauce. I also had a hazelnut latte (I’ve been deprived of hazelnut and french vanilla creamer while in Italy)- it was so yummy and a taste of home.
The way it works: they are technically “free,” but at the end, you tip your tour guide whatever you found the tour to be worth. These tours are typically anywhere from 2-4 hours, and you can easily spot them at the meeting location with their red umbrellas.
P.S.- I stopped at a Starbucks before the tour to have something hot while I was walking through the cold. I had a matcha tea latte (and added a bit of sugar). I highly recommend trying it! It’s a nice switch up (and healthy too).
While on our tour, we stopped at the Grassmarket Centre. Ironically, this was right across from our hostel.
Lunch: Olly Bongo’s. This was a cute, small restaurant with lots of different options. I had a baked potato with chili, a side salad, and cole slaw.
I can’t believe I’m admitting this, but I visited a catfe while I was there. I’ve been missing some animal time! We went to Maison de Moggy and it was a nice way to stay warm.
For lunch, we went to The Elephant Room, which is where J.K. Rowling got her inspiration to write the Harry Potter series.
I wrote my post cards here and enjoyed a flat white and a chicken pot pie with brown gravy and mashed potatoes.

It has been a long wait for the final season of Game of Thrones, and sadly, the wait is not quite over yet. But HBO has thrown hungry fans a bone with a shiny new teaser trailer. There's no new footage from the upcoming episodes, but we do get one full minute featuring some of our favorite moments from seasons past.
Game of Thrones is the HBO adaptation of George R.R. Martin's best-selling Song of Ice and Fire series of novels—for those of you who've been living under a rock since the show debuted in 2011 and turned into a bona fide global phenomenon. It's a ratings blockbuster for HBO that has won multiple Emmys and may be one of the most expensive TV series ever made, thanks to numerous film-quality battle scenes, CGI dragons, and a simply massive all-star cast of characters. Bonus: it's got a killer theme song and opening title sequence.
After a delay of more than five weeks, Microsoft has resumed the rollout of the Windows 10 October 2018 Update. The company also promised sweeping changes in the way it approaches quality issues, including better communication with customers.
On November 6, Boeing issued an update to Boeing 737 MAX aircrews. The change, directed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), came because Boeing had never provided guidance to pilots on what to do when part of an updated safety system malfunctioned—the very scenario that the pilots of Indonesia's Lion Air Flight 610 faced on October 29. Not knowing how to correct for the malfunction, the aircrew and their passengers were doomed. All aboard were lost as the aircraft crashed into the Java Sea.
First approved for commercial operation by the FAA on March 8, 2017, the MAX is just beginning to be delivered in large volumes. Lion Air was one of Boeing's primary foreign customers for the MAX, which is also flown by Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and Air Canada. The Lion Air aircraft lost in the accident was virtually brand new, delivered by Boeing in August; this was the first accident involving an aircraft touted for its safety.
Update: But Boeing never told pilots about one key new safety feature—an automated anti-stall system—or how to troubleshoot its failure. The manual update raised an outcry from pilots in the US.
Tovala improved the look of its smart steam oven, added more recipes and resources to the app and dropped the price.
Over the last year, Amazon has dangled in front of cities the possibility that they could host the company's "second headquarters"—a massive $5 billion facility that would provide 50,000 white-collar jobs. On Tuesday, Amazon confirmed what had been widely reported: nobody would be getting this massive prize. Instead, the expansion would be split in half, with New York City and Arlington, Virginia, (just outside Washington, DC) each getting smaller facilities that will employ around 25,000 people each.
Amazon's Seattle offices will continue to be the company's largest and will continue to be Amazon's headquarters by any reasonable definition. But pretending to have three "headquarters" undoubtedly makes it easier for Amazon to coax taxpayer dollars out of local governments.
The announcement is underwhelming in other ways, too. The Washington, DC, area has been widely seen as the frontrunner since the competition was announced last year. When Amazon announced a list of 20 finalists, the region claimed three of those 20 spots, with separate entries for Northern Virginia; Montgomery County, Maryland; and the district itself. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos bought The Washington Post in 2013 and bought the largest house in Washington, DC, in 2016.
The UK's big cities will be the first to get the futuristic mobile technology, says mobile operator.

Oakland, California, is just one of numerous American cities that have been transformed—for better or worse—by electric scooters.
Just earlier this month, a personal injury lawyer in Southern California filed a proposed class-action lawsuit seeking to take Bird, Lime, and the other scooter companies to task for their “draconian” terms of service.
Seeing our city streets become awash with these scooters almost overnight is something that local officials are trying to figure out how to deal with. Earlier this year, San Francisco famously imposed a moratorium while waiting to sort out a permitting process that would force companies to pay the city in order to operate their scooters about town.
Today, Google announced a new feature for its Project Fi cellular service: an always-on VPN. Project Fi's VPN previously was used to encrypt traffic while connecting to a network of free public Wi-Fi hotspots, but now Google will enable the VPN for all your traffic, be it over the LTE service or a Wi-Fi connection.
For now, the always-on VPN will need to be turned on in the Project Fi settings, where the feature is called "Enhanced Network" and labeled a "beta."
"When you enable our enhanced network, all of your mobile and Wi-Fi traffic will be encrypted and securely sent through our virtual private network (VPN) on every network you connect to, so you’ll have the peace of mind of knowing that others can’t see your online activity," Google's blog post says. "That includes Google—our VPN is designed so that your traffic isn’t tied to your Google account or phone number."
The government said the accounts published news that was sensational, vulgar or politically harmful.
Update, November 13: One of gaming's worst-kept secrets has finally been confirmed: PUBG is coming to PS4 consoles. Specifically, on December 7, for $29.99. As of press time, additional digital bundles can also be preordered for $50 and $70, and these include the game's variety of confusing microtransaction currencies.
With an admission that "this probably doesn't come as a surprise" (see original report below), PUBG Corp. made a Tuesday announcement that its one-versus-99 shooting sensation will include a few PlayStation-exclusive cosmetic bonuses for all PS4 preorders: a Nathan Drake (Uncharted) outfit and an Ellie (The Last of Us) backpack.

Looking for the best marketing strategies for your restaurant business? If you are then you should have the simplest but most effective options with the best results. Think of it like a way to cut costs while at the same time having the cutting advantage of making maximum profits. Here are some of the most dependable options to go with.
In this time and age, any restaurant business should have a social media platform that works for them. They can either have a Facebook page, Twitter handle, or instagram account. Facebook page is good for generating quick following and also engaging your followers, instagram is awesome for posting pictures of your sumptuous dishes, while twitter account could be pretty good for highlighting offers.
However, a business should only choose to use a single social media platform as it is easy to manage. Social media platforms can be paid or free – even so they will never dent your business coffers.
The use of picture size cutouts, posters, fliers, business cards, and banners are some of the most affordable marketing choices that restaurants can use. This is especially very true if the restaurant chooses the best crowd. I have seen some restaurants in the UK that usually opt to advertise in football stadia using banners.
Here is the trick, if you sponsor a competition, charity fund, or participate in a community service, it will give you an off page search engine optimization (SEO) advantage on your competition.
A responsive web design in restaurant management is another option that will not drain your money. The best thing about using a responsive web design is that you are able to reach very many people, embed links, link back urls from social media, advertise your offers, put up imagesand above all incorporate the best software based restaurant management options for your business.
Indeed if you optimize for mobile phones and also add up ideal mobile based applications, you will easily have the best market reach, real time service, and enjoy a very affordable marketing spree.
If you have an open source content management system (CMS) it will be very easy to work your way through. You can easily give posts that will make it easy for you to enjoy a great service and also to engage your buyers often.
Buyers love to come around and look through your website for new updates, blog posts, offers, and also new dishes. If you have a blog, you can easily take advantaged and introduce new things.
If you are using a web for your restaurant business, you should make sure that your design has the following qualities.
The tips that I have mentioned above are helpful in developing real time participation within your business. They are also affordable and will take less money.

If you are an art enthusiast, then art galleries should be your favorite place to be because of the paintings and pictures they often display. From a picture gallery you can write a several stories from the photos displayed since it is always said that, "a picture is worth a thousand words". Any photograph that is to be on display should be timeless. Millennials live their lives through the lens and like capturing precious moments in photos through digital technology. This makes it faster to post and share the photos on their social media platforms.
The memories captured will last a lifetime, so it is important that the pictures taken whether in printed form or otherwise be stored well. When it comes to pictures, there are three different types of photographs; the sepia model, black & white and colored. The term color correction defines the use of filters in photography to restore old pictures. Photo restoration services are offered to restore the appearance of an old physical photograph through its digital form copy if it has been damaged or defaced over time.
This software allows an editor to remove whatever they don't see to working within a photo since it has a photo eraser feature. Any imperfections that an old photo might have can be polished using the clone and crap tools. The Fotophire editing toolkit is currently on free trial since it was launched recently and is being advocated as the best for color correction services.
This is a one of the most authoritative photo restoration software. It enables you change the proportions of the objects depicted in a picture. Through this software an editor can restore old photos or images even if they are severely damaged. Its installation costs about $39.95.
Ask any image editing service provider and they will tell you that the Adobe photoshop is the best photo editing software. Through this app the restoration of photos shouldn't be a challenging task. Installation of this app will cost about $20.
The Corel Paint Shop Pro makes it easier for the editor to manipulate digital images in any way that they wish to do. During the image restoration services, it is timesaving though it is the most expensive and costs around $85.
For only $20 you will purchase this application which helps you remove any objects or persons from a picture with just a couple of clicks. It also allows you to erase wrinkles or remove skin blemishes from the model.
This app is efficient since most of the actual work is done automatically. It enables the imperfections to be concealed and for large objects to be removed from the background of a photo.
The listed apps are bound to be helpful for both professionals and amateurs in image restoration services so install one that you find easiest to use.
A FEW WEEKS ago, I sat at my desk, engaged in a staring contest with a vertical line on a blank Word document. Although the text cursor was on a stupendous losing streak, blinking every second, I kept playing with lackluster effort for about 30 minutes. Then I gave up. To be honest, I was feeling particularly uninspired about this month’s topic: gratitude. After a tumultuous year punctuated by unpleasant life events, my “Thank You(s)” to the universe have been somewhat halfhearted or even nonexistent. A day and several attempts at originality later, I knew I had to rely on someone or something other than myself for this piece.
While perusing internet studies linking thankfulness to happiness, decreased anxiety and depression, a dip in headaches and cardiac stress, I thought, with some skepticism: Really? So I reached out to Dr. Erick Messias, associate dean for faculty affairs and associate professor of psychiatry at UAMS, who, back in September, gave a talk about happiness and research in positive psychology. He was quick to note that gratitude is not just an emotion, but also an activity that can be changed and modified.
“The human brain is biased in the way it thinks,” he told me over the phone. “The first thing to do is to recognize that the way you feel is going to color the way you think. When you realize that, you can make specific decisions on trying to use your thinking to affect your mood.” Instead of focusing on the year as a whole, which will bring the most traumatic and grim incidents to the forefront of the brain and subsequently alter the way you feel, Dr. Messias recommended savoring the small wins and jotting them down as part of a daily gratitude exercise. “I would say, go small and go short,” he said. “If you start collecting the small stuff on a regular basis, that’s going to help you have a more balanced view of your life.”
Later that day, when I plopped down on the couch to get started on my gratitude homework, I heard the sound of my dog’s nails clicking against the floor as she sprinted toward me, her floppy ears and curly pompadour bouncing and bobbing. She curled up into a donut against my thigh, and looked up at me, with a combination of vague sweetness and hunger in her eyes. That! I’m grateful for that, I thought as my fingers started flying across the keyboard. As I typed, I was grateful for my laptop, which had survived a full-to-the-brim coffee spill a few days before.
That evening, after my fiance had grilled a thick, tender tri-tip to perfection, I was thankful for the meal that had made its way into my belly. For the next couple of days, I stuck with my plan, making note of mundane little things I was grateful for. I was grateful for coffee—for good coffee. Nice neighbors who didn’t mind me borrowing the steamer for the third time that week. (Oh, and magical, wrinklebanishing steamers!) That perfect stroll to the grocery store on a just-chilly-enough day under a dull, mid-morning sun. That rare moment when the internet stars aligned and Skype delivered a crystal-clear image of my grandmother from halfway across the world. My grandmother’s mini lectures on life, bookended by one too many “I love you(s).” Christmas lights at the mall. Avocados. An (almost) traffic-free drive.
I realized, in just a week, that I was noticing simple, small triumphs throughout the day that had previously gone unacknowledged. In the evenings, when I wrote them down, I recalled those moments, and, as Dr. Messias had predicted, they flooded me with positive emotions (and a hankering for grilled steak). I didn’t achieve a profound state of well-being or maximum personal happiness in a mere week, but I did notice a significant switcheroo in attitude. In other words, I stopped being a complete grouch. I went small and short, and shortly after wrapping up the week, I dug out a small, blank notebook I’d never used and placed it on my nightstand. Every night, I now scribble my tiny moments of gratitude by hand—and sometimes, I even let them claim a whole page.
Journaling every day might not be everybody’s cup of gratitude tea. Here are three other exercises for folks who need a little help looking on the bright side
Think of someone who had a significant impact on your life—a co-worker who helped you learn the ropes, a high school friend who was loyal to you even when you were morbidly uncool, a teacher who changed how you felt about math. Write them a letter expressing your thanks, schedule a tête-à-tête with the recipient and read the letter out loud. Not only does this kind of interaction amplify your positive emotions, it strengthens your bond and gives the recipient all the warm fuzzies.
Here’s a less dramatic exercise that can be done in solitude, and that’s just as straightforward as it seems. Take a 20-minute stroll and savor your surroundings—the sights, the smells, the sounds. Avoid the urge to Instagram. In fact, just leave your phone behind, if you can. Instead, take the time to explore, notice and reflect on the positive things you stumble across.
Place a vessel—a mason jar, maybe, or just something that allows you to see its contents— somewhere in plain sight. Jot down the rest of “I’m thankful because…” on a slip of paper, fold it up and stash it away in your jar daily. Watching the jar slowly fill up is a satisfying visual reminder of your blessings. You can even designate a jar for the entire family and read your notes of appreciation at the end of the year—or just whenever you need a boost of positivity.

Not only do we see world leaders capturing the limelight with their bombastic statements to emphasize their point in critical discussions, they also agree to disagree.
Donald Trump's G 7 meeting with his counterparts in Europe, or leaders of highly advanced economies is very telling of the adage, "never mix business with pleasure."
Everything boils down to the mind of Trump who minced no words in asserting the fact that what is due to America be given to America, no matter what. If payables are incurred in inter-country transactions, then it must be paid regardless of whether it requires banging heads with other super power countries within G7.
Really, its business as usual for Trump. He spares no one from his vitriolic comments in asserting his points that being allies is not an exception to the business rule. After all, everything is run and fuelled by business interest aside from political aims.

Stan wasn’t geeky as such; he was just a little creepy. He had very dark hair, slightly longer than would be regarded fashionable, really dark eyes – I’d guess at brown if asked, but they just looked black really, very pale skin – oh and really (and I mean really) hollow cheekbones. He could probably make a good model actually, if it wasn’t for the poor choice of clothes. Maybe I was being unfair. I don’t think he’d been given the option of choosing his own. As for his hair – well, let’s just say a decent haircut would go a long way to improve the way he looked.
She isn’t impressed at first, but soon things change and she and Stan find they have more in common than either could have ever known.
When Molly’s dad finds out that she and Stan have become friends, he tries to send Stan back to Gore, but Molly has other plans…

Everyone needs a bit of optimism in their lives, and this neon sign poster is the perfect pick-me-up. Pop it on the office noticeboard, set it as your phone background, or share it on social media to spread the good vibes.
We’ll create the poster layout in Adobe InDesign and prepare the design for either printing or online circulation. This is a great all-round introduction to graphic poster design for beginners.
If you’re looking for a quick-fix design, these high-impact poster templates from GraphicRiver and Envato Elements will do just the trick.
Firstly, make sure you have access to Adobe InDesign. Then you’ll also need to download the following images and fonts:
Set the Width of the page to 24 in and Height to 36 in. Keep the Margins to their default width, and add a Bleed of 0.25 in to all edges of the page. Then click OK.
On the Gradient Ramp, set the left-hand stop to Deep Pink and the right-hand stop to Shadow. Click on the ramp to add a third stop in the center, setting this to Maroon.
With the rectangle selected, head up to Object on the main menu, and Effects > Transparency. Set the Mode to Multiply and reduce the Opacity to 90%, before clicking OK.
Use the Line Tool (\) to draw a slightly diagonal line across the top half of the page, as shown below.
Select the Type on a Path Tool (Shift-T) and click once on the left side of the line, to transform it into a text path.
Switch to the Selection Tool (V, Escape) and select the line. From the Swatches panel, set the Stroke Color to [None].
Select the line and Edit > Copy, Edit > Paste, moving the copy below. Adjust the text to read ‘will’ and reduce the Font Size a little.
Edit > Paste the line again, editing this text to read ‘be’ and moving it over to the bottom-right of ‘will’, as shown below.
Paste again, moving this copy to the bottom of the group, and adjusting the text to read ‘alright’. Increase the Font Size a little.
With the pasted Pale Pink group selected, go to Object > Effects > Transparency. Set the Mode to Screen and Opacity to 70%.
Click on Outer Glow in the left-hand menu. Set the Effect Color to Pale Pink and bring the Opacity down to around 65%.
Finally, click on Gradient Feather at the bottom of the menu. Set the Type to Radial, and click OK to exit the window.
Edit > Paste in Place to drop another group of text lines onto the page. We’ll use this copy as a highlight, to give the text effect some extra glow.
Click on Outer Glow in the panel’s menu, and set the Effect Color to Pale Pink. Set the Opacity to around 55%, add about 10% Noise, and set the Spread to 40%.
Use the Pencil Tool (N) to draw more lines leading from the outlying edges of each word, trailing down to the bottom of the page. Repeat the same Stroke Weight and Color as described in the step above.
Add a few looped lines between the words in the center of the layout, setting the Stroke Color to Dark Pink, to indicate the increased amount of light at the center of the poster.
Use the Line Tool (\) to create a line under the baseline of the top word, ‘Everything’. Set the Stroke Color of the line to Shadow and set the Weight (from the Stroke panel) to 11 pt.
Edit > Copy, Edit > Paste the line, shortening it to fit under ‘will’. Repeat two more times, placing copies of the line under ‘be’ and ‘alright’.

There’s a line in one of my songs, “Finding Barbie’s Shoes,” that says, “every day is laundry day.” If you have any kids at all, you know what I mean. Well, unless you have a shipping container full of clean underwear in your backyard, that is. In that case, you’re probably violating some sort of skivvy-related zoning ordinance.
I’m killing time right now, waiting for a load of pants to dry. Well, pants, skirts, shorts, colored socks and colored underwear. That’s how I categorize this particular load of laundry: it’s worn below the waist, and it’s colored. Next I’ll be loading up the washer with hoodies, blouses, t-shirts and tablecloths. What’s that you say? You never wore a tablecloth? Remind me not to invite you to a party.
Scaling Mount Laundry is a never-ending expedition at the Wire homestead, and Barb and I tend to separate laundry differently.
“Honey,” she’ll call from our bedroom in the back of the house, when she hears the washer filling up. “What kind of load are you putting in?”
“Yeah!” And white shirts. And silk shirts. And rayon shirts. And flannel shirts. But no sweaters, man. I ignore washing all my wife’s sweaters, because they eventually seem to take care of themselves.
Being a Professional, who works in an Office, Barb has a wardrobe of conservative, adult clothing that mostly requires hand washing or dry cleaning. I found that I had to ruin only one or two garments before being relieved of that particular duty. Now these high-maintenance, fussy career clothes pile up in their own hamper in our bedroom, getting completely ignored by me every day as I round up all the dirty jeans, t-shirts, boxer shorts and sweat pants. I tell you what, I’d wear a three-piece suit to work every day if Champion made one out of sweat pants material.
And then there’s the whites. I wash the crap out of the whites (I used to mean that literally, but the kids have gotten better at doing their, um, paperwork). Hot water. Hot rinse. Extra soap. Second rinse cycle. Bleach. More rinse. I pour a couple glugs of Clorox down the bleach hole, and then I spend the next two hours gagging, eyes watering, till the washer quits spinning and those clothes are sparkling white. Super white. Larry Bird white. Occasionally, Barb will ask me about a particular piece of clothing that I have included in this Silkwood-level process.
The dryer is a whole ‘nother source of conflict between Barb and me. I have a problem with dryer sheets.
Rusty and I spend the winter with sore throats and wheezy lungs. This is partly because of Missoula’s infamous dirty air, and partly because we smoke a lot of cigars. Well, since Rusty is only nine, his are the bubble gum variety. Anyway, I heard that Proctor & Gamble and other soap companies imbue their dryer sheets and fabric softeners with addictive chemicals and fragrances, compelling consumers to feel a need to use their products more and more. These chemicals, it turns out, can be highly irritating to folks with compromised respiratory systems. This was reported on Fox News, so it has to be true, right? Well, as soon as I found out about this, I bought some crazy static-breaking gloves for the dryer, and organic, geranium-based fabric softener for the washer. The gloves seemed to work for everything but Barb’s career clothes, which began to cling to her like real estate agents on a retired Californian. Plus, she didn’t like smelling like a flowerbox.
So I found a compromise. We use dryer sheets that claim to be free of dyes and perfumes. But they still smell vaguely perfumey. I mean, if their purpose is to keep clothes from clinging together, shouldn’t they smell like Teflon? Or Pam? Maybe I should take another whiff. There’s probably one stuck to the inside my sweat pants.
The whole clothes-washing ritual has so many unanswered questions in general. For instance, every time I empty the dryer I have to peel a foot-long blanket of lint off the lint screen. With this much material being sucked from every load, how is it that we have any clothes left at all? If I iron the lint blanket will it become a doo-rag? Could I use it to wipe up minor spills and treat cuts and abrasions? And if we’re not finding other uses for it, does it all just go to waste? I think there’s more lint in our nation’s landfills than there are old tires and Mariah Carey CDs.
All in all, the laundry is probably the least unpleasant of all the housekeeping chores. Unless I forget to empty Rusty’s pockets the day he brings home a hamster.

The North Caithness Cliffs SPA is located on the north coast of Caithness in northern Scotland. The site comprises most of the sea-cliff areas between Red Point and Duncansby Head on the north mainland coast, and the western cliffs on the island of Stroma. The cliffs are formed from Old Red Sandstone and are generally between 30-60 m high, rising to 120 m at Dunnet Head. Cliff ledges, stacks and geos provide ideal nesting sites for important populations of seabirds, especially gulls and auks. The seabirds nesting on the North Caithness Cliffs feed outside the SPA in the surrounding waters of the Pentland Firth, as well as further afield. The cliffs also provide important nesting habitat for Peregrine Falco peregrinus.
This site qualifies under Article 4.1 of the Directive (79/409/EEC) by supporting populations of European importance of the following species listed on Annex I of the Directive:
Peregrine Falco peregrinus, 6 pairs representing at least 0.5% of the breeding population in Great Britain (Mid-1990s)
This site also qualifies under Article 4.2 of the Directive (79/409/EEC) by supporting populations of European importance of the following migratory species:
Guillemot Uria aalge, 26,994 pairs representing at least 1.2% of the breeding East Atlantic population (Count as at 1987)
The area qualifies under Article 4.2 of the Directive (79/409/EEC) by regularly supporting at least 20,000 seabirds
Note that sites selected for waterbird species on the basis of their occurrence in the breeding, passage or winter periods also provide legal protection for these species when they occur at other times of the year.

Yesterday was Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and to mark the holiday, The Algemeiner's Rachel Frommer reports that the IDF focused on the civil rights leader's message of choosing compassion over hatred:
In the clip, seven IDF soldiers, each in turn, says part of the following: “Dr Martin Luther King once said, ‘Every man must decide whether he will walk in the light of creative altruism or in the darkness of destructive selfishness. This is the judgement. Life’s most persistent and urgent question is: What are you doing for others?'”
Though King never visited the Jewish state he once said in an interview: “The whole world must see that Israel must exist and has the right to exist, and is one of the great outposts of democracy in the world...”

Cancellation policies vary from hotel to hotel. The policies are not the property, nor at the discretion, of this site. Each hotel's cancellation and rate-rules policies are posted on our web site so that you may have immediate access to them at the time of booking.
Your request is put into our system and processed as soon as you submit your information on our secure reservation form. We verify your credit card number, double check the availability for your request and display your confirmation number instantly. We also send your personal information to the booked hotel.

By entering the correct number of adults that will be staying in the room your search results will reflect all applicable charges.
The system requires a minimum of 24 hours to get your reservation to the hotel. The instant you book a room, however, that room is taken out of the hotel's inventory and is set aside for your use. The hotel will not be able to access your specific information immediately; they will only know that the room is reserved and not available to anyone else. This keeps the system moving and still ensures that no one else can book your room.
In most instances, deposits are recoverableifthe cancellation is made before the forfeiture deadline. These deadlines are the policies of the individual hotel or chain. Please check the cancellation and rate rules policies on our secure reservation form before reserving your room.

Reserving a room online does require a credit card, but this does not mean your card will automatically be charged the full amount. For most reservations, we just need to verify the authenticity of your card and the presence of available funds in order to hold the room. We also charge a modest service fee for using our hotel reservation system. At the end of your stay you may choose your form of payment at the hotel.
Prepayment Policies-Your card will be charged immediately for the full price of the room including all taxes and fees. Involve special low rates and are usually non-refundable.

"In my role as the Sustainability Coordinator in the Governor's Office, I partnered with Michael Karp and A W.I.S.H to convene regional International Association of Sustainability Businesses and Organizations (IASBO) gatherings. These gatherings were critical in fostering state and regional momentum towards sustainability. A W.I.S.H's unique approach to convening meetings lead to quality interaction and productive exchange of ideas between sustainability practitioners in Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), business and government practitioners.
A W.I.S.H was a key partner in developing the concept and carrying out the vision for the first Governor's Leadership Summit on Sustainability in Washington in 2001. The event was a huge success and served to catalyze government leadership for Sustainability in the state. Critical to our success was the extensive network of expertise and learning which A W.I.S.H brought to the task, as well as a deeply collaborative and inclusive work style. I can say without hesitation that we would not have been able to carry out this event without the support, guidance and assistance of A W.I.S.H. The Summit resulted in a Governor's Executive Order on Sustainable Practices for State Government and development of the 'Action Plan for a Sustainable Washington'."
"A W.I.S.H. has given Project Salt the structure and support that allows us to focus on the mission of preserving the musical traditions of Cape Verde. The "umbrella" has brought together diverse expertise and it has created a forum that is ideal to share information and resources, and most importantly a vision to fight poverty a work towards sustainable living."
"Cutting-edge concepts, ideas and strategies often need support, protection and cheer leaders to attain their potential. Time and again I have watched A W.I.S.H. pick up and run with such concepts, ideas and strategies. In an age bloated with fear, A W.I.S.H., instead, serves as a lubricant for courage and boldness. My for-profit and non-profit projects would not have attained their current stature without A W.I.S.H.'s great work."
"A W.I.S.H is a pathway organization especially for international groups in terms of financial fundraising, handling and advice. Eco-garden is a Community Based Organization in Kenya that works on environment conservation and organic agriculture project by serving the rural small-scale farmers but could not meet USA 501 (c) 3 status as required by most funder's. A W.I.S.H stepped in as a financial bridge for Eco-garden. Long live A W.I.S.H!"
"The People's Waterfront Coalition has been thrilled with the support offered by A W.I.S.H. as our fiscal sponsor. We are a grassroots organization advocating a more sustainable future for Seattle's downtown shore after our elevated highway is taken down. A W.I.S.H.Â has offered organizational guidance, effective strategic advice, encouragement, and connections -- far beyond the fiscal management commitment they took on. Our group is steadily gaining ground and convincing leaders to pursue a greener, smarter solution than building a new highway. We never could have come this far without their help."
"With the support of A W.I.S.H., Community Friends was able to respond to the tsunami disaster with lightening speed and quickly establish our trust in the village. Timing is everything in a crisis and A W.I.S.H made the implementation happen in a most effective way."
"It is difficult to express how grateful we have been at Asociacion Andar for the support of A.W.I.S.H. Andar is an Honduran non-profit that has worked for over fifteen years in poverty-stricken rural areas of Honduras. When I returned to the U.S. in 2003 afterworking with Andar in the south of Honduras, one of my main goals was to find financial support for our grassroots projects there. A.W.I.S.H. has made it possible to provide our donors (frequently individuals, families, schools, and churches) with a tax-deductible option. They have also provided us communications support through their website, and their on-going encouragement and organizational advice has been invaluable. Our two newest projects â€“ a community-based education center for small children and their families, and a scholarship program for highly capable students who cannot continue their studies due to the financial challenges of rural poverty - have been thriving since we joined together with A W.I.S.H. Without their support, we would not have the donor-base that we currently have. A W.I.S.H. has made a world of difference for us in our efforts to connect interested donors to community-based education efforts in southern Honduras. We would not be where we are right now without their support!"
"I am writing to express my sincere appreciation of AW.I.S.H. for its ongoing council and mentorship in helping to bring Organic Press into a successful non-profit solutions based media platform for the community. After two years of intensive service, we were graced with the opportunity to come under the wing of AW.I.S.H. This has been a major milestone and a catalyst for our organization. Your distinguished presence and insight into community matters has helped us further refine our mission and our purpose as a local community journal. As a result, we have made some decisions that we anticipate will bear much fruit. Thank you and god speed in all your endeavors."
"The World Green Building Council proudly works with A W.I.S.H. on shared missions of promoting sustainability. Through small projects with anticipated major results, our two organizations are collaborating to develop such tools as roadmaps for green building council development in Latin America and educational programs to support market transformation."
"AWISH has been a tremendous partner with the Department of Community Trade and Economic Development. Michael Karp is opportunistic, entrepreneurial, creative and pragmatic. His experience, energy and network help bring together vital projects that address the holes in our safety nets and find common ground among seemingly unconnected constituencies. His involvement in building community wind projects that benefit low income people is a great example of his ability to make connections and make things happen. Michael helps to create partnerships that get interests out of our silos and get things done. I look forward to every phone call with him because I know the project will be interesting, as well as address a problem and improve our future."
"The Linuxola project installs computer centers and offers computer technology training to community members in four rural villages of Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. It was established in 2004 in partnership with four village schools to support and empower schools and the poor. We have trained 550 students, 20 educators and 55 unemployed youth, the majority being out of school young girls.
Our project is sustained by regular contributions received from A World Institute for Sustainable Humanity, with help from other international donors and small contributions from the people we serve.
The computer centers are growing into strong community centers which will house various poverty alleviation projects such as mushroom cultivation, hydroponics, extraction of essential oils and youth programs focused on information dissemination, art, culture and heritage, and mentorship.
This concept is being duplicated in various villages by multi-purpose community centers in and around South Africa as a powerful model to deliver services to the poor."

I recently used RxJava while creating an add-on for Stash, the Git repository management tool from Atlassian. The plugin’s called “Who’s the Expert?” and it analyses commits to a repository to help answer two questions:
In order to achieve this, the plugin has to process a lot of data: it pulls all commits on the default branch for the last 2.5 years and analyses the content of every single one. I knew two things about this code in advance: first, there were going to be a lot of steps to go from a repository name to a leaderboard of the most influential committers, and second, I was pretty certain I’d need some multi-threading mojo in order to get it to perform in an acceptable time frame.

"Let me warn you and let me warn the Nation against the smooth evasion which says, "Of course we believe all these things; we believe in social security; we believe in work for the unemployed; we believe in saving homes. Cross our hearts and hope to die, we believe in all these things; but we do not like the way the present Administration is doing them. Just turn them over to us. We will do all of them- we will do more of them we will do them better; and, most important of all, the doing of them will not cost anybody anything."
"But, my friends, these evaders are banking too heavily on the shortness of our memories. No one will forget that they had their golden opportunity - twelve long years of it.
"Remember, too, that the first essential of doing a job well is to want to see the job done. Make no mistake about this: the Republican leadership today is not against the way we have done the job. The Republican leadership is against the job's being done."

Every year, around 1.8 million patients in the United States utilize hospice care. This usage has continued to increase in the last 10 years, due to the access patients have for this type of care. On the other hand, palliative care offers a unique opportunity for patients diagnosed with a life-limiting illness to begin treatment earlier than a hospice patient. Knowing the difference between the two can give you or your loved ones the option to choose which care model works the best for their needs.
Hospice care focuses on end-of-life care due to a life limiting diagnosis; typically toward the last few months of expected life after treatment options have been exhausted. Hospice patients must have a prognosis of 6 months or less if the illness follows its usual course. However, palliative care can begin at diagnosis, while being treated for a life limiting diagnosis.
Both models focus on a team approach to care with an emphasis on comfort or improving quality of life for the patient. Both palliative care and hospice care provide comfort. However, palliative care can begin at diagnosis, and at the same time as treatment. Hospice care begins after treatment of the disease is stopped and when it is clear that the person is not going to survive the illness.
In Muncie, palliative care is provided during hospitalization, while hospice can be provided in the hospital and in all home settings.
Absolutely not. In fact, palliative care is often used along with curative treatment. Palliative care can transition into hospice care if certain conditions are met throughout the treatment journey, but do not necessarily mean hospice care is imminent.
Hospice care does not mean that at all. Treatment of a life-limiting illness is a unique journey for all. Comfort and quality of life are key aspects of hospice treatment. There is still a stigma attached to hospice care that needs some adjustments. Hospice care does not mean that you’re giving up hope; it means you’re redefining your care and creating a flexible approach to improving your quality of life.
If you or your loved one is diagnosed or currently suffering from a life-limiting illness, the first step in determining care options is to talk to your current provider about what is available to you. Based on your illness and current care plan, palliative care or hospice care may address your quality of life concerns. Opening up the discussion with your provider is the most important step in deciding on which care model fits you or your loved one’s needs during their journey.
The holiday season is a time for reflecting on memories with families and friends. With this in mind, members of the hospice and palliative care teams are eagerly anticipating the 2018 Glowing Memories reception (formerly known as Season of Hope) in the IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital South Tower Atrium on Nov. 25 from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. Please join us in celebrating! Call 765-747-3420 for more information.
Karen Wells, RN, is the East Central Region director for Hospice and Home Care at IU Health Ball Memorial Hospital. She has been with the organization for two years, along with 20 years of home health and hospice experience.
A study in Toxicology & Environmental Chemistry submitted by Syaheeda et al demonstrated that high antioxidant content in Tualang honey benefited smokers with severe oxidative stress.
Based on findings from a previous study with Chlorella and herbs, both high in antioxidants, proved that natural products have effect on oxidative stress in male smokers, Tualang honey was used to study rats affected by smoke. Positive results from the rat test led to the experiment on men with a chronic smoking habit.
Tualang honey is collected by bees from the nectar of flowers in the Malaysian Rainforest. Aware of healing potential of honey throughout history, this honey too is filled with healing components, such as antioxidant activity, phytochemicals, vitamins, minerals, organic acids and proteins.
The researchers tested the effect of the honey for 12 weeks on smokers in a group of 32 chronic smokers against two equal-sized control groups; one group was not supplemented, the other was a group of non-smokers. Blood was tested before and after the study from all groups. Blood tests pre-intervention showed antioxidant status in smokers to be significantly less than in the non-smoking group. After 12 weeks of supplementation with Tualang honey, antioxidant status in smokers increased considerably with higher values of total antioxidants status, catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities. These systemic enzymes are important free radical destroyers.
The conclusion of the intervention is that Tualang honey can be used as a supplement for chronic smokers exposed to free radicals in cigarette smoke and those who are exposed to second-hand smoke to protect or reduce the risks of diseases from smoking especially cardiovascular disease.
One does not see people smoke in public places because it is prohibited by law. This does not mean there are no smokers.
Smoking increases free radical activities in the body with resulting oxidative stress. This causes serious diseases of the heart, arteries and lungs.
Free radicals are very harmful, despite their being the product of natural oxidation processes from the body’s metabolic functions.
A healthy body can neutralize free radicals with antioxidants such as vitamins A, E and C or from other antioxidants found in plant foods and in a healthy diet. http://bodyiqonline.com/real-food/
Age increases free radical production, but reduces the amount of antioxidants in the body. In smokers, this imbalance carries risk of serious illnesses especially if they are older.
According to the CDC, more than 16 million Americans are living with diseases caused by smoking. Based on trends, it will have reached 8 million by 2030 because many young people, younger than 18, take up the habit. Commercials with warnings to stop smoking or not to start appear again on television. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death. Smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers.
Smoking is an addiction as difficult to stop as heroin. There are patches, gimmicks of various kinds, classes and group support, and prescription drugs to help the afflicted.
Will studies like these, promising natural products with high antioxidant status such as Tualang honey achieve better health, prevent stroke, myocardial infarction or cancer while the chronic smoker lights up another cigarette? Probably not, only the smoker himself can stop smoking and an impending disease.

According WPC presentation equipment manufacturers, wood-plastic composites (WPC) is a new green composite material, polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acrylonitrile, butadiene-styrene copolymer (ABS) and other recycled materials and processing of treated waste wood, sawdust, twigs, straw or husks and other plant fibers in accordance with a certain proportion, add special additives, high temperature and high pressure after treatment system a synthetic material. Therefore, WPC best able to embody economy, low carbon economy, environmental protection, resource conservation, energy conservation and other advanced concepts of sustainable development, become the most dynamic manufacturing equipment WPC new biomass composite material. Practice WPC production tells us: Although lignocellulosic fibers and herbs are the basic raw material production of WPC, however, due to the different wood fibers and herbal fiber material, its geometry is different, in the actual production of wood different amounts of fiber and herb filling fiber, it may affect the mechanical properties as well as the cost of production of WPC.
North American production of [url=https://www.pinterest.com/chenchen12495/]wood-plastic composite materials[/url] are basically using mesh of 20 to 40 mesh wood flour fiber. As these larger size fiber wood flour, wood flour particles are very evident, not only affected the wood meal in the homogeneity of the material, but also led to the appearance of rough, reduces material beauty and decorative. WPC product fineness wood flour produced in Japan could reach 100 to 200 mesh, it has fine texture, appearance more beautiful. Due to lower wood flour fiber size will make it surface area is increased, so that the wood flour processing more difficult, for the WPC production process conditions and equipment to mention higher requirements. At present, most domestic production of wood-plastic composite materials for wood flour particles requirements are 40 to 80 mesh, fiber aspect of this size more in line with domestic flour processing equipment and technology level, on the other hand the surface treatment product comparison easy to make products closer to having a wood texture. It is noteworthy that, due to the wood-plastic composite material has the aesthetic, good mechanical properties, low maintenance costs, easily degradable, anti-termite advantage, flame retardancy, etc., and now more and more domestic and foreign wood processing and students pay attention to the material sphere material. So, to make wood products truly ranks among the top students substance composite article, and has some advantages in cost, it is necessary to solve the problem from the source of wood raw material production.
And based on years of experience in the processing of the wood flour, the company recently launched a self-developed flour processing machinery and equipment, both can be processed woody fibers, the fibers can also be processed herbs, it can also produce a granular and fibrous wood powder, also according to the different needs of WPC, adjusting both the geometry and the ratio of flour mesh for wood raw material research and development to refine and deepen, played a certain role model.

We can see that the total sales of Chinese wood flooring sales in less than a European laminate flooring, wood flooring business why we do not have a real material can become big in terms of volume, the market share of over 10% are difficult? There are deeper reasons worth thinking.[url=http://choosenewdeck.com/new-deck/3564.html]maintenance free wood polymers[/url] European flooring market data based on European Enhanced Data flooring Manufacturers Association EPLF announced: in 2010 worldwide sales of 479 million m2, second only to reach the 2007 record of 500 million m2.

Most Chinese flooring export enterprises will be imposed punitive tariffs of 18.9 percent on domestic flooring companies, this is as good a record in a sunny day muffled thunder.
A small number of enterprises with low tax rates China Forestry Industry Association Deputy Secretary-General Sun Zhigang, is the representative of China to strengthen the main person in charge of responding to the wood flooring business.

Beth asked if I have heard from other people who want to help their loved ones do things that will improve their happiness. In fact, I have heard from many people with similar challenges, and Beth?s letter, Ruth?s letter and Lizabeth?s letter -- all of them in today?s column -- cover that subject.
Whenever someone has a physical condition that can shorten their life or make it so they can?t live the normal life they have been living, they often don?t want to face it. There are many ways to help them, but you need to be in contact with their physician so he is aware of what?s happening with their attitude. If he doesn?t know about the emotional problems, he can?t do anything to help. He can become your key ally in motivating your loved one.
I?m not sure you can help me, but I hope you can. I am single, 34 years old, and work 40 hours during the week. My siblings decided that I am the one to take care of my 69-year-old father. Dad is losing his sight and won?t get out of bed when I?m not there. He?s getting weak and is very, very hard of hearing. He won?t see a doctor about any of his problems. I am getting very resentful and don?t know what to do. Have you heard of any other parents like my father? What can I do?
Your father has been able to take charge of things all his life, and now he doesn?t know what to do to make things better. He is helpless, and afraid of that situation. To be quite honest, I don?t know how I would react in his situation.
It sounds like you are going to have to take over your father?s care completely, even if you would rather not. That reluctance is a normal feeling every adult child has when it comes to their parents. You must do it, though. Call their doctor and explain the situation. You might also ask him about the possibility of counseling. Perhaps he will have suggestions about how to get your father to an appointment. Even if he doesn?t, make an appointment and do what you need to do to get him there.
You may need help from your siblings. Call them, explain that you need their help and ask them to come over to help when it?s time to leave for the appointment. Your father?s problem could be a result of a physical problem, or he may be depressed because of his situation. Either way, he needs help, and you are the one to get that help.
Do what you need to, and you will find your resentment will improve as you take charge of the situation. You feel you didn?t have any choice in the matter and that your father should be helping, but he isn?t. You ? and he ? must simply live with that fact.
When you have things under better control, you will be able to bring someone in to let you take a break and go shopping, to a movie, or something else you enjoy. You do need that time away from caregiving. Be sure to arrange that time away for yourself.
My problem is my husband. He has emphysema and has to be on oxygen 24/7. All he does is lay in bed and watch TV. He could go out to meet his friends for coffee, or something else, but he doesn?t want to. He says he is too embarrassed because of the oxygen tubes. He?s getting weaker all the time, is hard of hearing and won?t consider help with his depression. He says he isn?t depressed but he has all the symptoms. How can I get him to start enjoying the time he has left?
This isn?t uncommon, but you do need to do something to help him. It sounds like he may be physically able to get up and do things. Even if he can?t, you can help him do things.
Call his doctor and explain the situation. He may be able to prescribe something that will help, and he may suggest counseling. You may have to give him the medicine, but that would be all right. Do what you can to get him to talk to a counselor. Be sure to stay in contact with the doctor so he has an understanding of what?s going on.
Is your husband strong enough to sit in a wheel chair? If he can get out of his bedroom, it might help his attitude. Personally, I think it would be very depressing to be in one room all the time and never see the rest of the house. Take one step at a time. Don?t try to take him outside the house right now, but try to get him outside his bedroom. You can work on leaving the house after he finds he likes getting outside his bedroom.
Then, would it be possible to ask his friends to drop in on him occasionally? If he finds that they are not concerned about his oxygen tubes, he might be more willing to meet them for coffee out of your home. They might even talk about the tubes with your husband and tell him that it is common for people to walk around the shopping mall with them, for example. These steps should help your husband be more comfortable about his situation ? and motivated!
I live next door to a friend with Huntington?s disease. Along with the symptoms of HD, she is forgetful, tired and unhappy. She doesn?t go out like she used to and just sits home watching her soaps. I realize that HD is not a disease I would want to face, but she must face it and get over this emotional situation she?s in. What can I do to help her get out and start enjoying life? She refuses to go anywhere when I ask her.
Just like the other writers in my column today, I also suggest that you, too, contact her doctor for help by explaining your concerns. If you can?t talk with him directly, leave a message with the receptionist explaining the situation. He needs to be aware of how she is reacting to having HD.
Then, consider having some friends ?drop in? on her. They could visit one at a time, or you could have a small (2-4 other people) surprise holiday party. You will need to decide which would be better. You know her and I don?t.
If you know someone is coming by or you do have a surprise gathering, go over to her place a few days before and make sure the house is presentable. That day you could go over and insist she get bathed and dressed. She will accept seeing people much better if the house looks presentable and she is clean and feels that she looks good.

Going for fastest turn around ever. Tastes amazing at bottling, crazy low pH though. Nose isn't really much, but does have a berry character. Tastes awesome! Great aftertaste. Not sure how to describe it. Took awhile to carb also. The coconut is nice, subtle in the finish, a little over carb, guessing extra sugars from the coconut being eaten up by yeast. This beer at 3 weeks is insane. REALLY good. The sugar carbed one especially.

The shower is a fascinating concern. For that circumstance I would go over it with a few tile fellas. It'd be probable to install the extra potent foam board, then the membrane, then scratch coat, then tile but I’ve under no circumstances finished it so I wait to propose that tactic.

As someone who’s written hundreds of articles for fancy publications, I’m often asked the best way to land free publicity.
Outside of knowing when you have truly have something that’s noteworthy and knowing which audiences are most likely to find your something relevant, my colleague Josh Steimle recently wrote about the subject for Entrepreneur; specifically how to get great PR in 15 minutes per day.
Josh was kind enough to interview and quote me in the article. This is what I said: “Indirect PR pitches are the best way to increase your chances of a media placement. Rather than talking about yourself, explain a larger trend that might interest the journalist or publication you’re pitching, complete with stats, anecdotes and data.
“Your contribution should be only part of the story. Doing so not only makes the press’s job easier but demonstrates greater objectivity, further increasing your chances of a placement.”
Despite its recent troubles, General Motors is the luckiest company in the world over the next few weeks according to Jalopnik. The car-loving blog — while heavily praising the movie’s entertainment value– says the highly-anticipated Transformers movie is basically a 144-minute commercial for GM. From the article:
“What makes this arrangement so amazing is that GM didn’t pay Paramount a single dime to get it done. That’s right — not a single penny changed hands between the big n’ beefy automaker and the big n’ beefy studio. Sure, GM provided some in-kind contributions of concept vehicles and the like, and of course they’ve got their own marketing budget running their own marketing campaign — but unlike other automakers, they didn’t drop a single pence into Paramount’s pocket for the privilege of having themselves featured in a movie [aimed at the coveted 15-35 male demographic, you know, the ones that buy a lot of cars] about cars that change into robots.”
NOTE: Transformers looks incredible! At first I thought the movie and its premise seemed too lame for the big screen, not to mention juvenile and over the top. But after seeing (and hearing) the amazing CG, cinematics, and deep sound, I cannot wait to see this film. “Autobots, transform. And roll out!” (spoiler-free review here)
Brilliant! A picture truly is worth 1000 words. Via Ads of the World. Bonus: Go check out these three crazy ads from years’ past. Blowing smoke in a girl’s face used to be a turn on…? It did in advertising.
In case you didn’t know, Nintendo has been on a storm over the past year (I’m a big fan). Their stock has doubled over the past 12 months thanks to their nifty little DS handheld and motion-sensing Wii console.
So in commemoration of Letterman’s 60th birthday, Nintendo sent the late-night host a candid and personalized letter along with 2 handhelds and games that it’s pitching to an older generation, all with an insane amount of message consistency. The letter copy is far from the bloated stuff PR peeps normally send. Have a look for yourself.
Assuming Dave’s publicists personally delivers the loot, I’d be surprised if Letterman doesn’t name drop the product on his show. So let’s recap how to earn quality free media:
Get creative when pitching individuals, bloggers, newspapers, magazines, and TV personalities. Asking for coverage is lame. I’m amazed PR reps still do it. Get creative when pitching, and it better be good because bell cows have seen it all (see above example).
Despite being a celebrity, people still love free personalized goodies. Everyone has a flattering point. Make sure you product or service can do that, and it will be a lot easier to get free coverage.
This post comes courtesy of a good friend — Nicholas Roussos — as he so concisely describes and interesting event that transpired in public relations yesterday. First a little background. Sony’s newly launched PlayStation 3 is in a world of hurt. It costs a whopping $600 (Blu-ray included) and people aren’t buying it. The value proposition just isn’t there yet (if ever) on a mass scale. Note: PlayStation brings in 60% of Sony’s total profits.
So yesterday, the world’s largest gaming blog, Kotaku, leaked information that Sony would be releasing a new social networking tool heavily inspired by Nintendo’s and Microsoft’s already existing user-generated content efforts. Sony asks them not to run the story, but Kotaku rightfully does anyway.
About an hour later, Sony blackballs Kotaku from all company relations saying only information in the “public domain” will be made available to Kotaku in their coverage of Sony products. Kotaku publishes Sony’s archaic email ban and fittingly describes the biggest conflict of interest between PR and journalism in a respectful reply to Sony’s head of PR, Dave Karraker: “I think [your reaction] only highlights the differences that PR people and journalists have. My interest is not in making sure that Sony has positive news or that the timing of their news is correct, my job only is to inform the readers of news as quickly and accurately as I can.”
Immediately after Kotaku’s follow up post to their rumor, the internet implodes. Every single gaming blog is quick to criticize Sony’s reaction. The story reaches Digg’s homepage, and Sony’s already negative relationship with consumers spirals even further out of control, all in a matter of hours. Sony quickly caves, and reinvites Kotaku to all of their events, etc. Everything like it was before only Sony leaving having learned a valuable lesson. That is the online conversation changes everything, as Nic states “Cluetrain-style.” The above example shows Sony PR trying to do what traditional PR does; control the message and its timing. Kotaku makes that effort to control public and fosters more leverage against the mighty Sony corporation than it ever could alone. The online conversation is so powerful that even a company as big as Sony has to give in.
I don’t care what calculated advice your PR company gives you, this is how you start correcting a mistake if you run a consumer business, or any business for that matter. It’s called a sincere apology and it’s been helping men stay out of the dog house since the dawn of time. Watch as JetBlue CEO David Neeleman publicly apologizes on YouTube to his customers. He takes full responsibility after leaving numerous passengers stranded on a frozen tarmac for 10.5 hours at JFK. Admirable.

Being right next to the bay, North Bay Road is able to offer such a spectacular view that most people go for when it comes to living in Miami. Being able to provide convenience to its diverse residents while still providing safety to everyone that comes here to experience what the locale has to offer, this district makes living near the beach a privilege that does not necessarily need to be loud nor difficult. People mostly choose from luxury homes that are a short distance away from the beach, or they can go for the properties that are right up in the face of where the action is. Either way, when you consider moving into this neighborhood, you are fully able of shaping the sort of lifestyle that best suits you.
Gandalf as a Maia (named Olórin) before leaving the Undying Lands. Originally called Olórin , he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar (with the possible exception of Melian). He was a Maia of Manwë and Varda. He also served under two other Valar, such as Irmo and Nienna. When the Valar decided to send the order of the Istari (also known as Wizards) to Middle-earth, to counsel and assist all those in Middle-earth who opposed the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda decided to include Olórin among the five who were sent. At first, Olórin was nervous and described himself as too weak and too afraid of Sauron. Manwë understood, and told him that that was one main reason why he should go, to overcome that fear. Thus, he insisted that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him not to include Olórin as the third, but as the second. Olórin agreed, and prepared for his departure from the Undying Lands with the other four wizards.
Arrival in Middle-earth. When he arrived to Middle-earth, he received Narya, the ring of fire, from Círdan the Shipwright. Olórin, renamed Gandalf , spent many centuries walking among the elves as a stranger, learning from them and teaching them. He later revealed himself as one of the Istari, and eventually became known as the wisest of and most powerful of that order. He joined the White Council, which was formed to investigate a dark power in Dol Guldur, of which Galadriel wanted him to become the leader, yet Saruman came to lead the Council instead of him. Although Saruman was initially more powerful and more knowledgeable about many matters regarding Sauron and the Rings of Power, and was head of the White Council before the War of the Ring, he later grew jealous and afraid of Gandalf, [2] which was the reason of his betrayal.

Our full body scan technology can help you prevent a medical crisis. Knowledge is power and we help provide vital information as part of preventive medicine. Many of our patients get "true" peace of mind knowing they are healthy.
As days go by, Full body MRI scans continue to grow in popularity as it pertains to preventive medicine. Specialized medical facilities with the right level of technology offer this service to patients who want to be proactive about their health.
Full Body MRI Scans have become an excellent form or preventive medicine, especially for those who do not wish to be exposed to any radiation. A good example are pregnant women who need to undergo examination without harming their unborn baby. Below, you will find some of the significant benefits that patients receive when they go through a full-body MRI scan.
The purpose of MRI full body scan is to ensure that a patient can identify health risk in the early stages so the can make any lifestyle changes before it is too late or begin treatment if necessary. Many medical professional produce whole body MRI scans to CT scans. Regardless, both are very effective at identifying hidden chronic illness, tumors and other harmful body conditions.
The whole body MRI scan is safe. Patients who undergo the examination need not worry about long-term exposure to radiation. The MRI machine utilizes a High Magnetic field which works efficiently through hydrogen ions and safe radio frequency. Hence, patients can have more than one MRI scan without worrying.
The unique ability of MRI screening device to differentiate between tissues structures, is one of the things that makes it very effective. With an MRI full body scan, patients get a better idea of their body and any potential health risks.
With the newest MRI technology, patients do not need to wait hours for the can to conclude. Now, you can get your result within 20-30 minutes, which is a big step up. Also, a scan of the pelvis and abdomen now take lesser time than that of ultrasound.
With the ability of the MRI imaging scanner to differentiate tissue structures, particular areas of a patient’s body can undergo tests to determine if there is a cause for alarm.
If you have a condition that has already been diagnosed and is due for a follow-up scan, then you could have your multiple scans without worrying about radiation. Again, this screening method is preferred by many.
It is easier to get a referral from a physician for an MRI Scan because of the absence of radiation. This helps expedite the overall process.

The various armed forces adopted all of those aspects in 1976. At that point in time, the test was in its written form rather than today’s more common form (computerized test format). The written form covers all of the previously mentioned areas as well, which is why both forms are still available. All-in-all that answers the question concerning the intention of the test.
Other training and auxiliary organizations of the Army, Marine Corps, Merchant Marine, Civil Air Patrol and Coast Guard Auxiliary, as in the preceding order. The CAP was constituted through the Administrative Order 9 of 1 December 1941 and operated under the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. The CAP became the official civilian auxiliary of the newly independent USAF with the enactment of Public Law 80-557 on 26 May 1948.
After World War II, with the onset of the Cold War, the constant technological development of new weapons was institutionalised, as participants engaged in a constant 'arms race' in capability development. This constant state of weapons development continues into the present, and remains a constant drain on national resources, which some[who?] blame on the military-industrial complex.
The military uses the verbal expression (VE) score to measure your communicative ability. The score goes toward computing the AFQT score as well as many of the military’s line scores. The military brass determine your VE score by first adding the value of your Word Knowledge (WK) raw score to your Paragraph Comprehension (PC) raw score. The result is then converted to a scaled score ranging from 20 to 62.
Having military intelligence representatives participate in the execution of the national defence policy is important, because it becomes the first respondent and commentator on the policy expected strategic goal, compared to the realities of identified threats. When the intelligence reporting is compared to the policy, it becomes possible for the national leadership to consider allocating resources over and above the officers and their subordinates military pay, and the expense of maintaining military facilities and military support services for them.
The test measures competency in 9 different subjects, which include General Science, Electronics Information, Auto and Shop Information, Mechanical Comprehension, Assembling Objects, Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge. These last four sections- Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Mathematics Knowledge are the most important, as they make up something called the AFQT (Armed Forces Qualifications Test). An applicant’s AFQT score is what determines whether or not they are able to serve in the military at all, as each branch has minimum scores for enlistment.
A century or so later, in the hands of writers such as Jean Froissart, Miguel Cervantes and William Shakespeare, the fictional knight Tirant lo Blanch, and the real-life condottieri John Hawkwood would be juxtaposed against the fantastical Don Quixote, and the carousing Sir John Falstaff. In just one play, Henry V, Shakespeare provides a whole range of military characters, from cool-headed and clear-sighted generals, to captains, and common soldiery.
Division of Military and Naval Affairs (DMNA) Recruitment Incentive and Retention Program (RIRP). RIRP is a New York State program that offers tuition assistance for members of State military forces, such as the Army and Air National Guard and the Naval Militia. New York also offers a Veterans TAP Grant, which is received in addition to the regular TAP Grant.
The rank of General of the Armies is considered senior to General of the Army, but was never held by active duty officers at the same time as persons who held the rank of General of the Army. It has been held by two people: John J. Pershing who received the rank in 1919 after World War I and George Washington who received it posthumously in 1976 as part of the American Bicentennial celebrations. Pershing, appointed to General of the Armies in active duty status for life, was still alive at the time of the first five-star appointments during World War II and was thereby acknowledged as superior in grade by seniority to any World War II–era Generals of the Army. George Washington's appointment by Public Law 94-479 to General of the Armies of the United States was established by law as having "rank and precedence over all other grades of the Army, past or present", making him not only superior to Pershing, but superior to any grade in the Army in perpetuity.
The AFQT is not a separate test but is the collection of scores from these four sections of the ASVAB. Due to the fact that the AFQT scores determine the eligibility for enlistment into the military, it is important to score as well as possible. This site is designed to provide candidates that are taking the ASVAB with additional opportunities to practice questions in preparation for the types of questions they will receive within the official AFQT test sections. We provide sample practice questions across all four sections, including a score at the end of the practice exam so you can check your performance.
There are two types of military history, although almost all texts have elements of both: descriptive history, that serves to chronicle conflicts without offering any statements about the causes, nature of conduct, the ending, and effects of a conflict; and analytical history, that seeks to offer statements about the causes, nature, ending, and aftermath of conflicts – as a means of deriving knowledge and understanding of conflicts as a whole, and prevent repetition of mistakes in future, to suggest better concepts or methods in employing forces, or to advocate the need for new technology.
In the 1950s, the military adopted a single exam known as the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). Used as a screening tool, the AFQT measured a recruit’s ability to absorb military training and their future potential. It was supplemented by service-specific battery tests for the purposes of MOS classification. In 1972, the Department of Defense determined that all services should use one exam for screening and assigning individuals to an MOS. The AFQT was phased out over a two-year period in favor of the current Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test.
There have been attempts to produce a military strength index: this is an example taken from a Credit Suisse report in September 2015.[32] The factors under consideration for that military strength indicator and their total weights were: number of active personnel in the army (5%), tanks (10%), attack helicopters (15%), aircraft (20%), aircraft carriers (25%), and submarines (25%). It was practically impossible to make an estimation of the actual training of the armed forces. [33] These were the results:
A lot of people see the “CAT” term attached to the ASVAB test when they first start looking into the test and aren’t sure what that stands for. This term is an acronym and it stands for “Computerized Adaptive Test”. There are three different versions of the ASVAB test. The CAT is available at military processing stations for enlisting soldiers. The pencil and paper (also known as the P&P or S-ASVAB) version of the test is available for high school and college students who may not actually enlist. The third type of ASVAB test is the MET-ASVAB, or Mobile Examination Test, which is available only for enlisted soldiers at mobile testing centers (this test is also done with paper and pencil).
You often hear people say something like, "I got a 70 on the ASVAB." What they are talking about is the ASVAB AFQT score or Armed Forces Qualification Test Score. Many people think the AFQT score is the overall ASVAB score, but that's not correct. In fact, the AFQT score is derived from only four of the nine ASVAB subtests: Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Word Knowledge (WK), Mathematics Knowlege (MK), and Arithmetic Reasoning (AR).
Additionally, many ASVAB practice tests have a section explaining the answer choices. It can be tempting to read the explanation and think that you now have a good understanding of the concept. However, an explanation likely only covers part of the question’s broader context. Even if the explanation makes sense, go back and investigate every concept related to the question until you’re positive you have a thorough understanding.

All of the branches work together during operations and joint missions in Unified Combatant Commands, under the authority of the Secretary of Defense with the typical exception of the Coast Guard. Each of the Unified Combatant Commands is headed by a Combatant Commander, a senior commissioned officer who exercises supreme command authority per 10 U.S.C. § 164 over all of the forces, regardless of branch, within his geographical or functional command. By statute, the chain of command flows from the President to the Secretary of Defense to each of the Combatant Commanders.[22] In practice, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff often acts as an intermediary between the Secretary of Defense and the Combatant Commanders.
There are several different authorized pay grade advancement requirements in each junior-enlisted rank category (E-1 to E-3), which differ by service. Enlistees in the Army can attain the initial pay grade of E-4 (specialist) with a four-year degree, but the highest initial pay grade is usually E-3 (members of the Army Band program can expect to enter service at the grade of E-4). Promotion through the junior enlisted ranks occurs after serving for a specified number of years (which can be waived by the soldier's chain of command), a specified level of technical proficiency or maintenance of good conduct. Promotion can be denied with reason.
Extra back-to-basics practice that has helped thousands of recruits to qualify for the armed forces. Thousands of military recruits need extra help to pass the ASVAB, or Armed Forces Test and here’s where they can find it! ARCO’s ASVAB Basics offers intensive practice in reading, vocabulary, and mathematics the subjects covered in the four ASVAB subtests that determine whether a recruit qualifies for enlistment. Now updated, it features: * Full-length ASVAB subtests for practice * Drills to improve basic academic skills * Complete explanatory answers.
After World War II, demobilization led to the vast majority of serving women being returned to civilian life. Law 625, The Women's Armed Services Act of 1948, was signed by President Truman, allowing women to serve in the U.S. Armed Forces in fully integrated units during peace time, with only the WAC remaining a separate female unit. During the Korean War of 1950–1953, many women served in the Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals, with women serving in Korea numbering 120,000[dubious – discuss]during the conflict. During the Vietnam War, 600 women served in the country as part of the Air Force, along with 500 members of the WAC and over 6,000 medical personnel and support staff. The Ordnance Corps began accepting female missile technicians in 1974[33] and female crewmembers and officers were accepted into Field Artillery missile units.[34][35]
While you may want to get the ASVAB over with, it is important to give yourself enough time to prepare and practice for the ASVAB. Once you take the test you will have to wait 30 days before you are eligible to re-take the test if you got a non-passing score, or if you want a better grade. After you retake the test twice, you will need to wait for a 6 month time period before being able to take the test again. For this reason, it is important to pick an ASVAB test date that gives you plenty of time to practice and prepare for each section of the test.
Registration for the ASVAB is done entirely through your local recruiter. They will not want to start the application process without being confident that you will be a qualified applicant, so they will first ask you some information about your age, fitness, and marital status, among other things. They will likely also administer a short practice exam before taking you to a testing center to either give you a realistic idea of which jobs you would qualify for or to help you decide if it would be better to study before taking it.
The military offers boundless opportunities for people looking for a career in serving their country. The five branches of the military (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard) all have active, reserve, and guard units with jobs unique to each branch and level of commitment. Examples of different jobs include military police, telephone technician, psychological operations specialist, journalist, dental specialist, and oboe player. Each job allows for different levels of advancement depending on factors such as job performance and length of service.
ASVAB CEP test results are sent to students’ schools so they can explore career options with counselors. The scores show how well the student did on each subject, and how they compare with others who took the test. There are three composite scores in Verbal, Math, and Science and Technical skills, and the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score is also reported.
On the Learning Tools website, your options include 10-question ASVAB General Science practice tests. These ask you to use terms in context, define terms, and complete basic math problems. You may also be asked to categorize items and answer questions related to general scientific facts. The ASVAB Math Practice Tests are exercises that challenge your ability to correctly answer word problems based on sales and profit, speed, time, area, and other relational concepts.
The ASVAB also known as the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is a test that measures your aptitude which is how well you do something. A common mistake by most people is thinking that it is a measure of you IQ. Many people either forget this or don’t know this and they get worked up about the exam. Saying that, it is also important to take a ASVAB sample test to insure you know what type of questions will be asked. Another thing to keep in mind is every person in the armed forces has to take the exam and you are not being called out to take it.
The test is part of the larger ASVAB Career Exploration Program. The Program uses the test to help students identify both their interests as well as their strengths in three skills areas (verbal, math, and science and technical skills). Based on a student's skill levels, information is provided about more than 400 occupations in order to enable students and parents to judge their potential success in areas that interest them the most. Schools that may be facing budget cuts or finding themselves with limited resources devoted to career counseling are encouraged to find out whether using the ASVAB Program would be useful, as the testing and career development services are free of charge.
The AFQT is often mistakenly called the “overall ASVAB score.” You commonly hear someone say, “I got a 67 on the ASVAB,” or “My ASVAB score was 92.” That’s not correct; it implies that the AFQT is derived from all nine subtests of the ASVAB, and it’s not. The AFQT score is computed from just four of the ASVAB subtests that measure your math and communicative ability.
Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), and Mathematics Knowledge (MK). Scores on the AFQT are used to determine your eligibility for enlistment in the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps. The other six test scores on the ASVAB tests are used to determine the best job for you in the military as your grades will demonstrate knowledge, skill, and interest in certain subjects and tasks.
Less hot under the collar than This Year's Model, Armed Forces was partly inspired by Elvis Costello and the Attractions' 1978 American tour. The songs are set to deceptively poppy arrangements that use plinky Abba keyboards ("Oliver's Army," a hit single about mercenaries), Beatles-ish devices (the fade on "Party Girl"), and whimsical waltz-time signatures ("Sunday's Best") to mask their core cynicism. "Goon Squad," "Busy Bodies," and "Accidents Will Happen" are among Costello's most melodically powerful songs to this point, leading the way to the masterful Get Happy!!. --Barney Hoskyns
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) is a test that covers basic knowledge such as math and verbal skills, writing skills, and vocabulary. It is a required test for entrance into the military, but it can also be an indicator for general aptitude skills for other purposes. For those looking to go into military service, the ASVAB score is a crucial indicator of prospective job placement, so it is very important to take this test seriously and to focus on your strengths when taking the exam. Higher test scores often mean better jobs, higher salary, and more opportunities for advancement in the military.
You are tested in four critical areas — Arithmetic Reasoning, Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension and Mathematics Knowledge (see below) — these scores count towards your Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) score. The AFQT score determines whether you’re qualified to enlist in the U.S. military. Your scores in the other areas of the ASVAB determine how qualified you are for certain military specialties. Score high, and your chances of getting the specialty/job you want increase. The better score you get, the better chance you have of pursuing the specialty or field that you desire.
The President of the United States is the Commander in Chief, who is responsible for all final decisions. The Secretary of the Department of Defense (DoD) has control over the military and each branch - except the Coast Guard, which is under the Dept. of Homeland Security. With over 2 million civilian and military employees, the DoD is the world's largest "company."
As the speed of technological advances accelerated in civilian applications, so too warfare became more industralised. The newly invented machine gun and repeating rifle redefined firepower on the battlefield, and, in part, explains the high casualty rates of the American Civil War. The next breakthrough was the conversion of artillery parks from the muzzle loading guns, to the quicker loading breech loading guns with recoiling barrel that allowed quicker aimed fire and use of a shield. The widespread introduction of low smoke (smokeless) propellant powders since the 1880s also allowed for a great improvement of artillery ranges.

These forces demobilized in 1784 after the Treaty of Paris ended the War for Independence. The Congress of the Confederation created the current United States Army on 3 June 1784. The United States Congress created the current United States Navy on 27 March 1794 and the current United States Marine Corps on 11 July 1798. All three services trace their origins to their respective Continental predecessors. The 1787 adoption of the Constitution gave the Congress the power to "raise and support armies", to "provide and maintain a navy" and to "make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces", as well as the power to declare war. The President is the U.S. Armed Forces' commander-in-chief.

The projected active duty end strength in the armed forces for fiscal year 2017 was 1,281,900 servicemembers,[6] with an additional 801,200 people in the seven reserve components.[6] It is an all-volunteer military, but conscription through the Selective Service System can be enacted at the President's request and Congress' approval. All males ages 18 through 25 who are living in the United States are required to register with the Selective Service for a potential future draft.
The first recorded use of the word military in English, spelled militarie, was in 1585.[2] It comes from the Latin militaris (from Latin miles, meaning "soldier") through French, but is of uncertain etymology, one suggestion being derived from *mil-it- – going in a body or mass.[3][4] The word is now identified as denoting someone that is skilled in use of weapons, or engaged in military service, or in warfare.[5][6]
The Kaplan guide has everything I needed to prepare myself for the exam. The book was a great help for refreshing my memory in math and English for the test. Timing yourself on the practice tests is also a great way to make sure you are ahead of the game and never worry about time in the actual test. This is one of the best study guides I have ever seen or used but be prepared to spend time doing the work. As I said it will take hours to go through the material and learn what you need. I believed this book had a direct result in scoring an AFQT of 99. Excellent Book!
International protocols restrict the use, or have even created international bans on weapons, notably weapons of mass destruction (WMD). International conventions define what constitutes a war crime, and provides for war crimes prosecution. Individual countries also have elaborate codes of military justice, an example being the United States' Uniform Code of Military Justice that can lead to court martial for military personnel found guilty of war crimes.
In exchange for a service commitment, the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program provides you with money for college while you're in school. You must take one military science course along with your other college courses and, upon graduation, enter the service as a commissioned officer. (There is no military commitment for the first year in ROTC, allowing you to pursue ROTC on a trial basis to see if ROTC is for you.) Full ROTC scholarships pay for almost all tuition, fees and books charges for four years of college. ROTC scholarships also come in one, two and three-year lengths. For more information, call 1-800-USA-ROTC (Army), 1-800-USA-NAVY (Navy), 1-866-423-7682 (Air Force) and 1-800-MARINES (Marines).
In addition to the AFQT, the military also includes additional composite scores, often called 'line scores.' These scores are based on variations of the ASVAB's ten subtests and are required for certain military careers. For example, an Army Clerical (CL) score is determined by looking at an individual's Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR) and Mathematics Knowledge (MK) scores. Note that the subtests considered for different careers can vary depending on the military branch.
Capability development, which is often referred to as the military 'strength', is arguably one of the most complex activities known to humanity; because it requires determining: strategic, operational, and tactical capability requirements to counter the identified threats; strategic, operational, and tactical doctrines by which the acquired capabilities will be used; identifying concepts, methods, and systems involved in executing the doctrines; creating design specifications for the manufacturers who would produce these in adequate quantity and quality for their use in combat; purchase the concepts, methods, and systems; create a forces structure that would use the concepts, methods, and systems most effectively and efficiently; integrate these concepts, methods, and systems into the force structure by providing military education, training, and practice that preferably resembles combat environment of intended use; create military logistics systems to allow continued and uninterrupted performance of military organisations under combat conditions, including provision of health services to the personnel, and maintenance for the equipment; the services to assist recovery of wounded personnel, and repair of damaged equipment; and finally, post-conflict demobilisation, and disposal of war stocks surplus to peacetime requirements.
The other written test format is the Student ASVAB which is given at high schools, vocational schools, or colleges. This test lasts approximately three hours. The Written Arithmetic Reasoning subtest of the ASVAB consists of 30 multiple choice questions, which must be answered in 36 minutes. Below are a few sample questions which are very similar to the actual questions you'll see on the ASVAB:
1001 ASVAB Practice Questions For Dummies takes you beyond the instruction and guidance offered in ASVAB For Dummies, giving you 1,001 opportunities to practice answering questions on key concepts for all nine ASVAB subtests. Plus, an online component provides you with a collection of additional problems presented in multiple-choice format to further help you test your skills as you go.
Military history has a number of facets. One main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes, so as to more effectively wage war in the future. Another is to create a sense of military tradition, which is used to create cohesive military forces. Still, another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively. Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts (war), their participating armies and navies and, more recently, air forces.
The questions that have a tendency to arise rather quickly are something along the lines of “why is this test so important?” and “What is the overall purpose of this test?” Well, first it is important to define the actual test and to assess the colorful history of the test. The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test (ASVAB) is a test that was officially formatted in 1968 with the intention of mentally preparing soldiers with knowledge that identifies with the following:
How good is your vocabulary? It’s never too late to brush up by using “vocabulary builders” you find on Google, reading a variety of books, manuals and magazines, and using practice tests to identify words that you’re not sure of. The WK section tests your word knowledge in several ways. First, it tests whether you can recognize correct and incorrect spellings of words. For this type of question, you may want to review words that are often spelled incorrectly, and make sure you know how to spell them. You will also need to know the definitions of words, and be able to use them in a sentence. The more you practice, the better you will be at automatically recognizing the right spelling of a word, and the easier it will be to know it’s precise meaning when it’s used in a sentence.
Army.mil says of ASVAB/PiCAT testing, “The ASVAB is usually given in schools by test administrators from the federal government. Schools determine where and when the ASVAB will be given. See your academic advisor for more information. If you’re not currently in school, contact your local recruiter.” Test administration and scheduling procedures are handled differently by each branch of the military.
As in most militaries, members of the U.S. Armed Forces hold a rank, either that of officer, warrant officer or enlisted, to determine seniority and eligibility for promotion. Those who have served are known as veterans. Rank names may be different between services, but they are matched to each other by their corresponding paygrade.[23] Officers who hold the same rank or paygrade are distinguished by their date of rank to determine seniority, while officers who serve in certain positions of office of importance set by law, outrank all other officers in active duty of the same rank and paygrade, regardless of their date of rank.[24] In 2012, it was reported that only one in four persons in the United States of the proper age meet the moral, academic and physical standards for military service.[25]
A graphic view of the increasing trend in AFQT performance of accessions from FY 1981 through FY 1992 is provided in Figure 2.8. The more significant gains were in Categories I to IIIA, where the percentages increased from 47 percent in FY 1981 to 75 percent in FY 1992. Conversely, there has been a steady decline in the percentage of Category IIIB accessions. Most dramatic has been the decrease in accessions who score in Category IV—from 33 percent in FY 1979 to one percent or less since FY 1991. There has been a gradual decline in the percentage of accessions in Categories I to IIIA in the last seven years, from 75 to 65 percent.
The military offers boundless opportunities for people looking for a career in serving their country. The five branches of the military (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard) all have active, reserve, and guard units with jobs unique to each branch and level of commitment. Examples of different jobs include military police, telephone technician, psychological operations specialist, journalist, dental specialist, and oboe player. Each job allows for different levels of advancement depending on factors such as job performance and length of service.
In addition to the ASVAB's AFQT, each branch has military occupational specialty, or MOS, scores. Combinations of scores from the nine tests are used to determine qualification for a MOS. These combinations are called "aptitude area scores", "composite scores", or "line scores". Each of the five armed services has its own aptitude area scores and sets its own minimum composite scores for each MOS.
By military department, $146.9 billion was allocated for the Department of the Army, $168.8 billion for the Department of the Navy, $161.8 billion for the Department of the Air Force and $102.8 billion for DoD-wide spending.[6] By function, $138.6 billion was requested for personnel, $244.4 billion for operations and maintenance, $118.9 billion for procurement, $69.0 billion for research and development, $1.3 billion for revolving and management funds, $6.9 billion for military construction and $1.3 billion for family housing.[6]
As to the original studio album ("Armed Forces", the supposedly main disc), it's great, though not up to "This Year's Model" which is easily my favorite EC album. The lyrics on the album are especially great. One problem I have though is that the sound quality should be better. I don't know what the problem is, if the source tape is somewhat degraded or if the remastering has been over or under done. It's not terrible, just seems like it should be substantially better fidelity for a recording of a successful (by then) artist at that point in time. That's why I'm knocking off one star, otherwise it would get five stars from me. But the Hollywood High part alone would get five stars, so you might think of this as a great live album plus bonus studio tracks.
The adaptive test is exactly what it sounds like, a test that adapts to the test taker. Questions in each section range in difficulty, and based on the test taker’s answers, the question types and difficulties adjust with each answer. This type of test allows for a greater level of accuracy in evaluating a prospect’s abilities. For the most part, correct answers beget more difficult questions while wrong answers will reduce the difficulty of proceeding questions.
While considered part of the non-commissioned officer corps by law, senior non-commissioned officers (SNCOs) referred to as chief petty officers in the Navy and Coast Guard, or staff non-commissioned officers in the Marine Corps, perform duties more focused on leadership rather than technical expertise. Promotion to the SNCO ranks, E-7 through E-9 (E-6 through E-9 in the Marine Corps) is highly competitive. Personnel totals at the pay grades of E-8 and E-9 are limited by federal law to 2.5 percent and 1 percent of a service's enlisted force, respectively. SNCOs act as leaders of small units and as staff. Some SNCOs manage programs at headquarters level and a select few wield responsibility at the highest levels of the military structure. Most unit commanders have a SNCO as an enlisted advisor. All SNCOs are expected to mentor junior commissioned officers as well as the enlisted in their duty sections. The typical enlistee can expect to attain SNCO rank after 10 to 16 years of service.

Paragraph Comprehension tests the ability to obtain information from written material. Students read different types of passages of varying lengths and respond to questions based on information presented in each passage. Concepts include identifying stated and reworded facts, determining a sequence of events, drawing conclusions, identifying main ideas, determining the author's purpose and tone, and identifying style and technique.
SOC is a consortium of more than 1550 colleges and universities that provide educational opportunities for servicemembers and their families. It is co-sponsored by the American Association of State Colleges and Universities (AASCU) and the American Association of Community Colleges (AACC) and managed for the DoD by the Defense Activity for Non-Traditional Education Support (DANTES). Course work can be done on campus, at military installations and armories, and at a distance by computer or correspondence. Associate, bachelor, and graduate-level degree programs are available. Special curriculum areas include SOCAD (Army), SOCNAV (Navy), SOCMAR (Marines), and SOCGuard (Army National Guard). In addition, SOC operates ConAP (Concurrent Admissions Program) to increase college enrollment of Army enlistees (Army and Army Reserves). ConAP allows you to enlist in the Army at the same time as you apply for college. DANTES also operates its own Distance Learning Program. For more information, contact:
The process of allocating resources is conducted by determining a military budget, which is administered by a military finance organisation within the military. Military procurement is then authorised to purchase or contract provision of goods and services to the military, whether in peacetime at a permanent base, or in a combat zone from local population.
The Auto and Shop Information section of the ASVAB test measures your knowledge of automobile technology and basic repairs. The shop questions are about basic wood and metals. For example, you will encounter questions such as “Shock absorbers on a car connect the axle to the: wheel, chassis, drive shaft, or exhaust pipe?” You may be asked what sanding blocks are used for, followed by the following choices: preventing high spots and ridges on sanded surfaces, preventing dirt from collecting on the sandpaper, stretching the length of sandpaper, or prolonging the use of the sandpaper. The CAT-ASVAB test has two parts: the first part covering automotive material asks 11 questions in 7 minutes; the 11 shop information questions are allotted 6 minutes. The paper-and-pencil version asks 25 questions in 11 minutes.
The best way to answer questions in this section is to read each paragraph twice before you answer. First, read it quickly to get the main idea. Next, read it again, paying more attention to the details that relate to the main point. Then, read all of the questions and refer back to the paragraph to help you choose the best answer. If you take this approach, you will be more relaxed and efficient, and less likely to get thrown off the track by being nervous.
One of the oldest military publications is The Art of War, by the Chinese philosopher Sun Tzu.[34] Written in the 6th century BCE, the 13-chapter book is intended as military instruction, and not as military theory, but has had a huge influence on Asian military doctrine, and from the late 19th century, on European and United States military planning. It has even been used to formulate business tactics, and can even be applied in social and political areas.[where?]
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) is a multiple choice test, administered by the United States Military Entrance Processing Command, used to determine qualification for enlistment in the United States Armed Forces. It is often offered to American high school students when they are in the 10th, 11th and 12th grade, though anyone eligible for enlistment may take it.[2]
A military recruiter determines if the candidate is a possible recruit. A recruiter will ask about marital status, health, education, drug use, and arrest record. It is important for the candidate to be upfront and truthful when answering questions. Once the recruiter has determined the individual is qualified for additional processing, the ASVAB is scheduled. A physical examination may also be conducted at the time of the test.
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) is one of the most widely used multiple-aptitude test batteries in the world. It was originally designed to predict success in military occupations and is used today to help both those considering entering the military (mostly high school-aged students, but also anyone who is eligible to enlist) as well as those not interested in military service (who comprise the majority of current ASVAB test takers) what sort of career may be the best fit for them. Scores from the ASVAB can be used when enlisting in the military. Students interested in taking the ASVAB should check with their high school to find out when and if the ASVAB will be offered at their school. If it is not offered, students should meet with their guidance counselor to determine if it is possible to schedule a testing session in the future. There is no cost to take the ASVAB.
The CAT-ASVAB is a computer-based exam that is only provided at Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) for enlistment purposes. The test is customized based on the taker’s answers, so if one question is answered correctly, the next one will be more difficult. This exam is timed, although users have the option of pacing themselves throughout the exam. However, it is not possible to go back through the test and check answers or change responses after they have been submitted. The CAT-ASVAB is broken down into 10 subparts, including basics such as arithmetic and verbal skills as well as auto information, electronics, shop, and mechanical knowledge.
Getting a low score on the ASVAB might mean missing a chance at the military job you really want–or possibly not getting in the military at all. If the thought of taking the ASVAB has you stressed out, don’t worry- we’re here to help! Our free practice test for the ASVAB will help you identify areas or concepts you may struggle with understanding, so you can maximize the time you have to study and get the score you want the first time.
The ASVAB is a population-referenced exam, which means that the score you receive for the ASVAB is not an exact measure of how you scored on the test, but rather how you scored in relation to a national control group who took the test in 1997. Standard Scores are used on the ASVAB: in each subtest, about 50% of the population received a Standard Score of 50, while only 16% scored over 60. You will receive an estimated score after taking the paper test and official scores later through your recruiter, usually within days. You will immediately receive your scores upon completing the computer test.
Both you and your counselor will receive a copy of the results. Before you take the ASVAB, you will be asked to sign a statement authorizing the Department of Defense to score your test and return your results to your school. Each school determines if it will release your scores to the military services. If you are a junior, a senior, or a postsecondary school student, a recruiter may contact you. This can occur whether or not you take the ASVAB.
I would easily recommend this book to some people who are looking to solely study from the book, but also have no intentions of using the online practice questions. considering this book is from 2013 i discovered after it was delivered to my home. That being said there is no place for this book on the Dummies web site, and you cannot access the practice questions which you have paid for. Waste of money.
The ASVAB test is taken by individuals interested in joining the U.S. military. It may be taken by high school students in the 10th, 11th or 12th grade. Or, it may be taken by someone who has earned a GED or higher degree. Along with determining your suitability for enlistment, the score you receive on this test lets officials know what military occupational specialties you may qualify for.
An important part of the military intelligence role is the military analysis performed to assess military capability of potential future aggressors, and provide combat modelling that helps to understand factors on which comparison of forces can be made. This helps to quantify and qualify such statements as: "China and India maintain the largest armed forces in the World" or that "the U.S. Military is considered to be the world's strongest".[29]
It's important to understand the difference between the ASVAB Standard Scores, and the ASVAB AFQT score. Test takers will receive a separate score for each of the nine sections on the ASVAB. These scores are known as Standard Scores. A Standard Score is used to determine how the test taker compares to the "average" 18-23 year old American on that part of the ASVAB. Not long ago, a large number of people in this age group were given the tests, and these results are the benchmark for Standard Scores. Around half the people in this age group will score a 50 or higher, and about 16% will score a 60 or higher. In other words, the scoring is based on a standard bell curve distribution. Standard Scores are very important when it comes to determining which military job a person will be assigned to.
Sergeant Leigh Ann Hester became the first woman to receive the Silver Star, the third-highest U.S. decoration for valor, for direct participation in combat. In Afghanistan, Monica Lin Brown was presented the Silver Star for shielding wounded soldiers with her body.[45] In March 2012, the U.S. military had two women, Ann E. Dunwoody and Janet C. Wolfenbarger, with the rank of four-star general.[46][47] In 2016, Air Force General Lori Robinson became the first female officer to command a major Unified Combatant Command (USNORTHCOM) in the history of the United States Armed Forces.[48]
If you didn't earn a score that was high enough to be accepted to your chosen branch of the military, or if you didn't earn a line score high enough to qualify for a desired career option, then you may retake the ASVAB. You must wait a full month before you can take the ASVAB a second time. If you wish to take the test a third time, you must wait another month from the date of your second attempt. After the third attempt, there is a waiting period of 6 months before you can take the test again.
Standard Scores are scores that have a fixed mean and standard deviation in the population of examinees. A Standard Score indicates how many units of the standard deviation a particular score is above or below the mean. In the case of the ASVAB subtests, the mean is set to 50 and the standard deviation is set to 10. Thus, a Standard Score of 40 indicates that the examinee scored 1 standard deviation below the mean. A Standard Score of 70 indicates that the examinee scored 2 standard deviations above the mean. To learn more about how standard scores are derived and used, click here.
With very few exceptions, becoming a non-commissioned officer (NCO) or petty officer in the U.S. Armed Forces is accomplished by progression through the lower enlisted ranks. However, unlike promotion through the lower enlisted tier, promotion to NCO is generally competitive. NCO ranks begin at E-4 or E-5, depending upon service and are generally attained between three and six years of service. Junior NCOs function as first-line supervisors and squad leaders, training the junior enlisted in their duties and guiding their career advancement.
In the 2000s, women can serve on U.S. combat ships, including in command roles. They are permitted to serve on submarines.[39] Women can fly military aircraft and make up 2% of all pilots in the U.S. Military. In 2003, Major Kim Campbell was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for landing her combat damaged A-10 Thunderbolt II with no hydraulic control and only one functional engine after being struck by hostile fire over Baghdad.
All test takers are given a summary results sheet that shows their percentile score in every test area. A percentile score of 50 means that a score was achieved that was better than 50 percent of all test takers. Percentile scores are given specifically for test takers of their gender and their grade level. Information obtained from the test is only shared with agencies within the Department of Defense. Test takers are informed that their specific scores will be used for up to two years for recruiting purposes. After two years, test scores will be used for research purposes only.

The vast majority of ASVAB test takers will ultimately not enlist in the military. The ASVAB Career Exploration Program claims that only two-and-a-half percent of those who participate in the ASVAB join the military. Forty-seven percent of those who take the exam indicate an interest in attending a four-year college, and 16 percent of those who take the exam originally indicate some kind of an interest in joining the military.
Although concerned with research into military psychology, and particularly combat stress, and how it affect troop morale, often the bulk of military science activities is directed at military intelligence technology, military communications, and improving military capability through research. The design, development, and prototyping of weapons, military support equipment, and military technology in general, is also an area in which lots of effort is invested – it includes everything from global communication networks and aircraft carriers to paint and food.
Every single individual that goes through the enlistment process should excel both mentally and physically. That is the number one principle that has consistently inspired this nation to serve these brave and honorable individuals with unwavering efforts. Those efforts officially came to the forefront when the country as a whole decided to correct perhaps the most significant enlistment related problem (passing the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery test). Countless hours of hard work and dedication are currently reflected by the top-of-the-line ASVAB practice tests that this nation offers.
During World War I, the need to break the deadlock of trench warfare saw the rapid development of many new technologies, particularly tanks. Military aviation was extensively used, and bombers became decisive in many battles of World War II, which marked the most frantic period of weapons development in history. Many new designs, and concepts were used in combat, and all existing technologies of warfare were improved between 1939 and 1945.
The ASVAB test can be taken at your school or a MEPS (Military Entrance Processing Stations) or MET (Mobile Examination Test) sites. When the ASVAB is administered at your school, it is usually part of the Student Testing Program or Career Exploration Program. When the ASVAB is given at MEPS or MET sites, it is part of the Enlistment Testing Program. The ASVAB test content is the same no matter where you take it, except that you will not have to take the Assembling Objects test if you take the test at your school (as part of the Student Testing Program). When you take the test in the Student Testing Program you will receive three composite scores (Verbal Skills, Math Skills, and Science and Technical Skills). When you take the ASVAB as part of the Enlistment Testing Program, you will receive an AFQT (Armed Forces Qualification Test) score and Service composite scores. These scores are used for assigning your military job.
Militaries often function as societies within societies, by having their own military communities, economies, education, medicine, and other aspects of a functioning civilian society. Although a 'military' is not limited to nations in of itself as many private military companies (or PMC's) can be used or 'hired' by organisations and figures as security, escort, or other means of protection; where police, agencies, or militaries are absent or not trusted.
My name is Chris. I used the AFQT Secrets study guide for five days. I am ex-military retaking the AFQT to reenlist. I just want to say thank you for developing this study guide. My test score in 1988 was 51, today my test score is 89. I would just like to add that I have an A.A.S. Degree, but no math skills above basic high school math. This is where I was lacking, the study guide made it so easy to understand. Like you said this program is worth 100's of dollars. To me 1,000's!! THANKS, Chris G.
Somewhat earlier, in medieval China, gunpowder had been invented, and was increasingly used by the military in combat. The use of gunpowder in the early vase-like mortars in Europe, and advanced versions of the long bow and cross bow, which all had armour-piercing arrowheads, that put an end to the dominance of the armoured knight. After the long bow, which required great skill and strength to use, the next most significant technological advance was the musket, which could be used effectively, with little training. In time, the successors to muskets and cannon, in the form of rifles and artillery, would become core battlefield technology.
The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery is more commonly known as the ASVAB Test. If you are interested in a military career, you will need to pass this challenging test in order to qualify. It is used for all branches of the military which includes the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, National Guard, and Coast Guard. It is also used to gauge your abilities in specific areas that may be relevant to your job assignments within the military. For more information about the exact details of this exam, check out our article titled What is the ASVAB Test?
Military history has a number of facets. One main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes, so as to more effectively wage war in the future. Another is to create a sense of military tradition, which is used to create cohesive military forces. Still, another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively. Human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts (war), their participating armies and navies and, more recently, air forces.
A military or an armed force is a professional organization formally authorized by a sovereign state to use lethal or deadly force and weapons to support the interests of the state. It typically consists of branches such as an Army, Navy, Air Force, and in certain countries the Marines and Coast Guard. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state, and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military may also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, logistics, health and medical, law, food production, finance and banking.
The majority of people who complete the exam have little intention of entering the military. However, it’s important to keep in mind that the United States military is actually one of the nation’s largest employers. If you’re undecided about your future after high school graduation, taking the test can give you a better picture of your options in both civilian and military life.
AFQT scores are grouped into five main categories based on the percentile score ranges. Categories III and IV are divided into subgroups because the services sometimes use this chart for internal tracking purposes, enlistment limits, and enlistment incentives. Based on your scores, the military decides how trainable you may be to perform jobs in the service.
The CAT-ASVAB is an adaptive test which means the test adapts to the ability of the test-taker. It is possible to administer a shorter test this way than with the pencil and paper test. When you complete a subsection of the test, you can then move onto the next section of the test without having to wait for an administrator. Subsections are still timed however and on average it takes about 1 ½ hours to complete the computer ASVAB.
Examinees also receive a score on what is called the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT). AFQT scores are computed using the Standard Scores from four ASVAB subtests: Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), Mathematics Knowledge (MK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), and Word Knowledge (WK). AFQT scores are reported as percentiles between 1-99. An AFQT percentile score indicates the percentage of examinees in a reference group that scored at or below that particular score. For current AFQT scores, the reference group is a sample of 18 to 23 year old youth who took the ASVAB as part of a national norming study conducted in 1997. Thus, an AFQT score of 90 indicates that the examinee scored as well as or better than 90% of the nationally-representative sample of 18 to 23 year old youth. An AFQT score of 50 indicates that the examinee scored as well as or better than 50% of the nationally-representative sample.
If you are interested in using your test scores for military service, you will receive an Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT) score. This score is calculated using the scores from the Word Knowledge (WK), Paragraph Comprehension (PC), Arithmetic Reasoning (AR), and Mathematics Knowledge (MK) portions of the exam. AFQT scores are expressed as percentile scores in order to better compare results among all potential military recruits.
This advice, though well-intentioned, doesn’t address the needs of some new recruits who are interested in specific career fields but are worried about their test performance-especially in areas related to math comprehension. Potential recruits who feel deficient in math, language, or science skills should have a frank conversation with their recruiter to discuss possible refresher study or even supplemental classes in any self-perceived “problem areas” before taking the test.
On 3 December 2015, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter announced that all military combat jobs would become available to women.[40] This gave women access to the roughly 10% of military jobs which were previously closed off due to their combat nature.[41] The decision gave military services until January 2016 to seek exceptions to the rule if they believe that certain jobs, such as machine gunners, should be restricted to men only.[42] These restrictions were due in part to prior studies which stated that mixed gender units are less capable in combat.[43] Physical requirements for all jobs remained unchanged, though.[43] Many women believe this will allow for them to improve their positions in the military, since most high-ranking officers start in combat positions. Since women are now available to work in any position in the military, female entry into the draft has been proposed.[44]
The way to prepare for this exam is study hard and then quiz yourself with plenty of practice ASVAB tests. Remember that the exam is identical for all branches, so an Army ASVAB practice test is exactly the same as an ASVAB practice test for the Navy. The most important components of the test are the ones that count towards the Armed Services Qualifications Test, or AFQT. These sections are Word Knowledge, Paragraph Comprehension, Arithmetic Reasoning, and Math Knowledge. For tips and strategies for success on these questions, be sure to review our article on ASVAB Test Prep.
Military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts, not just the history of the state militaries. It differs somewhat from the history of war, with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making, while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology, governments, and geography.
With only a minute or two to answer each question, this part of the test might seem a little intimidating. But if you know how to approach the questions in this section, you should have no trouble at all. It’s well worth your time to take our practice tests, using the same logical steps to solve each problem until they become second nature. To solve these word problems, you will need to:
You can't use the AR and MK score shown on your ASVAB Score Sheet. The Score Sheet shows "number correct" for your AR and MK Scores, because "number correct" is what is used for job qualifications. However, the military does not use this same score when computing the AFQT. They use the "weighted scores" of the ASVAB sub-tests for AR and MK. Harder questions in these areas get more points than easier questions. The "weighted scores" for AR and WK are not listed on the ASVAB score sheet given to you after the test.
This continued in the 19th century, with publications like Punch in the British Empire and Le Père Duchesne in France, poking fun at the military establishment. This extended to media other print also. An enduring example is the Major-General's Song from the Gilbert and Sullivan light opera, The Pirates of Penzance, where a senior army officer is satirised for his enormous fund of irrelevant knowledge.
Doing poorly on the ASVAB might mean missing out on the military job that you really want- and maybe not getting in the military at all. If you’re stressed about taking the ASVAB, don’t worry- we’ve got you covered! Our free study guides for the ASVAB will give you an overview of the concepts you need to know and will help you pinpoint the areas you should spend your time studying. From Arithmetic Reasoning to Word Knowledge and every subject in between, our study guides for the ASVAB will help you get the ASVAB score that you need!
The first step that one will take after deciding to pursue a career in the military is taking the Armed Service Vocational Aptitude Battery test. This is more commonly referred to as the ASVAB. The ASVAB not only determines whether or not a candidate is qualified to serve in the armed forces but also shows which specific job they have the most aptitude for.
My recruiter told me about this book so I ordered it and got it 3 days later from the Military Bookstore. I got this book and it is awesome. The cd works great and every thing I needed and more to help me was in there. I recommend this book to everyone who is thinking of going in the service and wants to get a real job! GET THIS BOOK AND SCORE HIGH!!!!”
Nobody wants to be stuck doing something they don’t like. That’s why we urge you to take advantage of our free practice tests and study guides. Our ASVAB practice tests are formatted exactly like the real ASVAB test and will not only help ensure you have the knowledge to ace the real exam but will also prepare for the actual experience of sitting for the test.
This course is designed to help you dust the cobwebs off information you may have learned long ago or boost your scores if you have already taken the test (or a sample test administered by a recruiter) and did not meet the score you needed for the occupation you desire. This review is particularly helpful if you have been out of school for some time, did not graduate a standard high school program, or either did not take or performed poorly in classes related certain subject areas (e.g. shop or automotive classes). Within each subject area, the lessons build on one another, so we will help you progress in a logical manner in bite-sized, 10-minute-or-less chunks. Skip to the lessons that you know you need to focus on, and even jump to specific portions of the videos using the video tags. Use the quizzes, chapter tests, and course exam to see how you're doing and refocus your studies as necessary.
Retesting is possible depending on a variety of circumstances. It is possible to retake the ASVAB or PiCAT, but you will need to coordinate this with your recruiting office. In general you may be required to wait a month or more to retake the test; each branch of the service may have different requirements that must be fulfilled in order to retest.

I’m excited to be going to the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas in a few weeks. Before I started a career in software sales (ahem, 25 years ago!) I lived a life as a radio disc jockey. These were the days before digital. Well, almost before digital. The radio stations I worked at used CDs, but I cut commercials on reel to reel tape. Yay for splicing! Over the past year and a half, I started my own internet radio station at home. I play classic rock 24/7, and I’ve learned a lot about how to produce a quality music stream. Now, at work, I’m investigating radio/podcasting for a SAAS product we’re spinning up. It’s exciting to be able to get back into the radio thing after being out for so long. I hope to learn a lot at NAB, and bring home some intel on hardware, software, and engineering tips.

Sensor Technology in the Netherlands: State of the Art: Proceedings of the Dutch Sensor Conference held at the University of Twente, The Netherlands, 2–3 March 1998
Within the quickly constructing info society there's an ever-growing call for for information-supplying parts or sensors. The know-how to manufacture such sensors has grown some time past few a long time from a skilful job to a mature zone of medical study and technological improvement. during this strategy, using silicon-based options has seemed to be of the most important significance, because it brought standardized (mass) fabrication suggestions, created the opportunity of built-in electronics, allowed for brand spanking new transduction rules, and enabled the conclusion of micromechanical buildings for sensing or actuation.
The fifty three papers contained during this quantity replicate the goals of the foreign organization for Housing technology that are to enhance each part of housing expertise and creation relatively via new city making plans, new designs, new fabrics, new technological and administration advancements and leading edge financing.
Visual inspections can be carried out on both the ceramic and metallic parts, if required. These operations are carried out with the main power system depressurized and core defueled, via openings in the top and bottom heads of the reactor vessel. 35 The following principle factors were evaluated in the selection of the values for fuel enrichment and heavy metal loading: ¾ ¾ ¾ ¾ ¾ Influence on control rod reactivity worth, Maximum power production per fuel sphere, Maximum power production per coated particle, Effect on Xe reactivity effects, Maximum fuel temperatures which can be reached.
The function of the recuperator is to return heat downstream from the power turbine back to the flow path ahead of the reactor. This raises the helium return temperature to the reactor. The high temperature return helium is kept apart from any pressure boundary component by forcing the helium through insulated pipes to the ceramic core structures. The recuperator is required to exchange maximum heat with minimum pressure loss. The plate-fin recuperator will contain 72 modules arranged in six layers.

At Hillson University the drama is like no other; Ellie, an aspiring journalist, will learn just what it means to "do what you need to do to get the story". Grant is a star football player trying to live up to everyone's expectations. Devon is Queen Bee, and will stop at nothing to get Grant and parade him around on her arm. And then Charlie is about to change his nerdy, shy attitude in order to catch Devon's attention. What could go wrong?
I quite enjoy books that move between a lot of POV's. In this case the story revolves around the four main characters - Ellie, Grant, Devon and Charlie. It reminds me of reading series like The It Girl about 7-8 years ago.
I think a main thing to note from the start, is that this is rather predictable. Nothing really happened that was a huge shock or was a twist, so if that's what you're looking for, keep looking. But it does serve for a good light summer read that I read in one day.
Ellie: She is a typical innocent and fresh heroine, starting university with high hopes and dating not on her agenda. I feel she was a little weak though. It all felt too convenient, with how Tanner instantly took a shine to her (although there were other reasons) before he even knew who she was and simultaneously Grant also noted her as a woman of interest quite early on. But why do these heroines always have to be so naive and dis-trusting. I'm so tired of a heroine seeing/hearing something and totally jumping to conclusions. I understand there is need to keep a plot turning, but can authors not think of other ways? Like, I really felt sorry for Grant because she was pretty cruel to him, even if it was out of defense, she still didn't even allow him a chance to explain his side of anything, and that to me is such a frustrating trait.
Characters: There were a lot of characters in this, with their own agendas, and at times I did get confused with the secondary characters and how they were all inter-related with different main characters. But they all had a substantial difference to them, so every character felt like they served purpose and were distinct. I enjoyed the suspense and secrets surrounding Devon's drama and uncovering her family secrets. I really liked Charlie though. He was such an adorable character and I always loved reading about his nerdy t-shirts. I think he was the one I felt for most and was really rooting for, being the underdog and letting Devon treat him like shit but then he'd stand up for himself and it would be amazing!
I don't really like when there is cheating in books, and there wasn't really in this, but the love triangles gave me a headache. Ellie liked Grant, but also Tanner liked Ellie. Charlie liked Devon who was after Grant. Then Grant went out with Devon and Ellie with Tanner and it was just a bit messy for my liking. Appeared more like high school drama than university...
I read a similar review that actually mentioned legal drinking age and I feel that's a really good point. At this point, all the characters are underage as per American law. Whereas in Ireland (where I grew up) and the UK (where I now go to Uni) the legal age is 18. So by the time I got to uni I was already 18, and one of the youngest in my year, and most people had those rebellious alcoholic years behind them (save a few dodgy nights!) but on a whole, most people drink responsibly so the drama levels are not the same.
I'm sure a lot of NA readers would enjoy this, but personally feel it's more suited at YA due to the maturity levels and drama. I can't really relate to the characters and the scheming as being that of 18+.

No trip is complete to Panama city without spending time in the famous Panama Viejo. The ruins of the much maligned city are closely linked to the European discovery of the Pacific ocean, Spanish expansion, the history of piracy and the bullion lifeline to Europe. We were excited to see the ruins and at the same time dreading the throng of tourists happily snapping their selfie photos. To find the ruins you can follow these simple driving directions (or have a taxi):
Not for the direction challenged Dmitry it was not. Upon arriving on the outskirts of Panama city, we made one of countless wrong turns and ended up in opposite direction from the ruins. We then decided to try to get on Corredur Sur. The new route that was controversially built around the downtown core. It is a toll road and it costs $2.5 one way however, there are no exits along the way and we drove past the ruins again…
After wasting more than hour to get to fabled ruins, we somehow made it to Mercado National de Artesanias. The first remnants of the ruins are there. I strongly encourage to sign in and walk along the stalls of this market.
There is also Museo de Sitio Panama Viejo. We did not go as we were eager to climb our way to the real ruins and explore the Dmitry and Elena way.
We were incredulous to discover that apart from us, there was no one at the actual ruins. A very nice lady sold us the entrance tickets ( $5 each) and upon receiving the map, set us on our way. As you make your way deeper towards the tallest structure standing, the hum of the cars fades away. The honking and worn out brakes get muted and replaced by the incessant chirping of parakeets and other birds calling the park their home. We walked along what was one of the bastions of Spanish rule and could not help but envision what life must have been like 400 years ago here. The sun has reached its zenith as we made our way around the slaughterhouses, the residences of the wealthy citizens and cathedrals.
The rays of the sun touched the darkest corners of ruins, illuminating them as we explored. I couldn’t help it but stop to try to envision how hard life must have been. The diseases, the threats from the sea and land, the rigors of living so far from their homeland and to do it all in the name of their king. We wandered among the ruins free to shoot any way we felt like. (Note: If you are the type that wanders of the marked path and wants to explore the grounds a little be mindful of snakes. We saw one slithering away).
The highest point in the ruins is the bell tower and the park staff has done an incredible job of building stairs and guardrails to reach the top. As we were the only people there, bats adorned the walls, looking with their small, beady eyes. They made no attempt to fly away and just hung there like some ornaments. I resisted the urge to grab one! With every floor upwards, the view of the downtown stretched. The view from the upper floor was breathtaking.
Words were useless. The wind from the ocean burst into every crevice and a very entrancing sound emerged. We stood there entranced by the flapping wings of pigeons above, the howling wind and the magnificent view of the city. This was by far the best $5 dollars spent!
To here explore this part of the city, one must be prepared for an quick, easy one hour of leisure walk or you can do it our way. To do explore the “befree” way is to rid yourself of stereotypes and fears. It is to open your soul to new experiences and meetings. So many times upon returning do we wish we could have done more, said more and experienced more. Our goal is to break those barriers down and live life the way it is supposed to be. Free and open to new challenges.
We decided to leave the ruins when a horde of students descended like an avalanche on us. There were more than a 100 kids in the group, yet they were very kind and smiled non stop. I remember my high school field trips in Canada…They were a definitely not educational. The midday heat was relentless and with me losing the water bottle, we decided to head into the city to check out the financial district. As we were driving away, I thought that this city had its share of bad luck and is still standing so no wonder so many banks call this place their home.
Parking is a challenge to find in the city. We drove in circles trying to find a spot where to ditch the car and lucked out when Elena spotted a spot beside one of thousands of banks that make up the financial district. The so called restaurant street is undergoing a massive reconstruction with construction vehicles, closed businesses and an open restaurant here and there. The guide book I had, was published in 2010 and surprisingly 3!!! restaurants on calle 5A that we wanted to check out no longer existed. I thought that maybe we were on wrong street but a cop told us they were in fact closed. Either the competition is ridiculous or the food sucked.
We saw a tree house cafe and since it looked architecturally interesting and had a wall of foliage inside, we went to check it out. It turned out to be a regular coffee house and while this is not worth mentioning there was a small incident that happened to us there.
This place was tucked away in the financial district and not easy to find. I did not see any other tourists there and I guess our cameras gave us away as the staff took notice. The staff thought it would be funny if they served us at our table rather than ordering at the cashier and there was a steady stream of cooks, cashiers and even the manager that brought something to our table. It was very sweet of them and only when we were leaving we realized that we were the only ones served at the table. So green house cafe is the spot for us!
While we were downtown, I noticed how nature was trying to live symbiotically in urban setting. Huge trees created natural shade and pathways and sidewalks were created to avoid damaging the massive roots. Parakeets were chirping everywhere and to me it was a surreal scene. To see a parakeet sitting on a telephone line chirping, while a throng of business suits flows by. Cacophony of car horns filled the air yet the lonely parakeet just sat above it all and sang his chirping tune. To find this beautiful bird among huge concrete skyscrapers was surreal.
While looking for souvenirs, we decided to check out the malls. Let me tell you, with parking rates like these, this mall is already the best one in my books.
We didn’t find any souvenirs there as Panamanian malls do not differ from the ones back home in Canada. The same prices for clothes and the same brands like Victoria secret, Guess and others. They are cleaner and there is less people.
Through our website, we want to share our stories, photographs and hopefully the information might help someone on their trip or even awaken their own wanderlust.
My plan was that nobody else would die. Ever. My plan was to leave the death-and-dying biz to someone else; give someone else a turn. My plan was that enough was enough. At least for this year. My plan was that only the elderly die, and that sometimes it’s a blessing and an end to pain.
But this kind of pain comes to all ages. How could I have forgotten that? It’d been some years since I’d had a friend with suicidal ideation. One of them was successful at it. And one of them suddenly snapped out of it, just like that. Awoke from the nightmare, and there he was—suddenly fully alive, vibrant, and whole. With hope and joy in his heart instead of bitterness and despair. Finally.
Yesterday she sent the terrible email. Suicide note by email has the strange immediacy of someone hitting SEND and the word goes out, well, everywhere. And hers began with an apology and said without flourish or beating around the bush simply that she was ‘gone.’ And spoke about her pain and what she had done.
We tried to find her. The police were slow. Treated it as a ‘Missing Persons’ for a while. Facebook was slow (she’d posted an edited version of her email there)—because of the privacy issues involved. The whole planet felt slow. But a few hours later she was found. By the CA Park Service. By the rocks at Stinson Beach.
Amy was always meticulous. She was thorough. She got the job done. You could depend on her—but she did it her way. Whatever the task was, she could stick to it. Those are the qualities it takes to get a PhD in Anthropology or any other subject, for that matter. They were also the qualities it took to put on our conferences for the Society for the Anthropology of Consciousness. To keep up our mailing lists. To remind us when it was time to vote (or run for office). Remind us to submit abstracts to present at conferences. Remind us to register. She was good at herding cats.
Being meticulous is how Amy handled her own demise, too. She was thorough. She made sure that these obligations were taken care of—without letting on that that’s what she was doing. This time, procrastination might have served her better. But Amy, when she set her mind to it, she got things done.
She asked me to help put on next year’s spring conference—and I agreed—not to do it myself, but rather to help her with it. To do it together. But now I see, that wasn’t what she had in mind.
Last week she asked me to get together. We live, after all, not that far from each other. But each date didn’t seem to work for her. She was going away on vacation, she said. She wanted to see me before she left. I wanted to see her after. Only looking back can I see the urgency in her words. I missed it at the time. I wonder if she would have talked or listened if we had had that time together.
I would have told her about L who felt himself beyond hope, redemption, or any rehabilitation. He’d go to the Bridge, and the waters below the Golden Gate would open and invite him in. We kept a watch on him. Took turns bringing him food. As long as that frig was full he wouldn’t be so wasteful as to jump into the icy water. We kept him alive with a frig full of groceries. Perishables kept him from perishing. One day at the bridge, when he looked down—the waters below had shut their gate. He was no longer invited in. No longer welcome. And that was it—after so many months, his suicidal episode was over. He’d call us each year on the anniversary of that day. He was downright unrecognizable from the agony he had carried. He’d worked it out. Worked it through. Worked with it. Worked around it. I think the point may be that whatever it was, it worked.
I wish I could have told Amy about L, his pain, and his ultimate survival. For if L could find his way out of the wilderness, even Palestine has a chance of finding peace.
“I love you, honey!” Amy signed her penultimate message to me. However she may have meant that lovely salutation (formulaic or heartfelt), I’ll treasure it. I’ll keep it with me always. Thank you, Amy, for all your gifts. What can I say, but that you’re sorely missed.

Incase's Icon, Pop, and Textured Snap cases ($35-$40) for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the first Incase iPhone cases we've seen since the company was acquired by Incipio last year. All of these cases make the leap from iPhone 6s to these new devices. We received Icon for iPhone 7, Textured Snap for iPhone 7 Plus, and Pop for both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. All three cases have proper button coverage and cover all sides of an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus.
Icon for iPhone 7 uses Incase’s “TENSAERLITE protection technology,” which is meant to provide excellent protection in a thin frame. We don’t think Icon is particularly thin, but it is a very nice, sturdy case, with a perforated back that improves grip.
Pop is thinner than Icon. It doesn’t feel quite as sturdy as Icon, either, but it should still provide good protection for an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. We are a bit concerned about the long-term durability of the small section of the case between the Home button and Lightning port, based on a bit of warping we’ve seen in just a few days.
Textured Snap is a great choice for iPhone 7 Plus users who prefer something with more grip than a typical case. The co-molded Textured Snap is quite stylish, in our estimation, and the inner microsuede backing is a nice touch. But we are concerned with fraying edges around the sides of the case, where the textured surface meets the TPU bumper.
Minor qualms here or there, notwithstanding, Icon, Pop, and Textured Snap all have more than enough positives to offer iPhone 7/iPhone 7 Plus users. All three cases earn our strong general recommendation.

Edit: I've removed the photos from public view. Event organizers had privacy concerns, and since photography is just a hobby for me, I'm not going to be taking the time & effort to blur or crop faces & badges out of those photos.
It was bitter cold in Ottawa yesterday and (understandably) none of the regular players showed up, but a couple of Magic players from the front room came over for some demo games. Here's a photo from the end of the first round of the second demo game I ran:
I've scheduled another demo for February at the FLGS downtown. I've edited the details into the OP above.
Had another game with Jon yesterday. We started a little late, and elected to just use the demo setup instead of having a full two-player game.
Jon also chose to be the defender in the scenario, which meant I would have to fight an uphill battle to win.
(I failed to keep a good record of the end of round conditions after this, so the rest of the photos blur together the rest of the game)
My frames take the station and destroy one of Jon's frames, putting me in the lead. But victory isn't secure yet.
The game ends in a tie as I keep posession of the station, but fail to destroy any more of Jon's frames.
It was a fun game, still using only my demo frames, though Jon has started building his own. I should also do some more building of frames, terrain and stations before the next demo day in March.
Everytime you post a new date I tell myself I should go this time. I swear I'll make it to one of your demo sessions. I got into MF0 briefly when it first got big, but never got around to trying the actual game, but it does seem like quite a good game.
I've scheduled another demo for the first Saturday of March at the FLGS downtown. I've edited the details into the OP above.

And if the dates I've set aren't good for you, let me know a date that is, and maybe I can give you a demo then.

Now that you’ve listened and responded to your client’s need, what’s next on road to building your 6-figure speaking business?
Click the player above to listen or, better yet, subscribe to the Get Your Message Heard podcast in iTunes or your favorite podcast app.
When you hone in on the power of connecting with your audience BEFORE you speak, you exponentially increase your impact WHEN you speak.
If you want to truly differentiate yourself, if you want to truly put your business on a faster path to growth, this is the secret sauce!
So, let’s continue with the 6-Figure Roadmap by covering steps 3, 4 and 5, which all relate to the audience.
Step 3 is to understand the audience. Remember, when you make a speech, not everyone may be excited to be there. Some are, but some aren’t. You have to work extra hard to connect to them.
As you prepare for your engagement, ask the meeting planner if it’s possible to have a few one-on-one conversations with people with those who will be attending your session.
You will gain amazing insight into the unique aspects of your audience through a series of short phone calls. And be sure to get their permission to share their stories. It will add value to your presentation.
Step 4 is all about sharing the most relevant stories. We use stories to illustrate the lessons we want the audience to learn. To make the stories fit your audience, be sure to leverage industry information.
Every industry has its own set of information, terminology, successes, and problems. Find a way to become an insider who knows the industry secrets. It will take some work, but it will be worth it.
Step 5 is preparing judiciously. We can’t just put a new logo on a presentation, change a few words or swap out the photos. We have to go deeper. Customization is critical, as is rehearsing … and rehearsing some more.
Ultimately, you want to create an impactful presentation: one that people will remember once they leave your session. Personally, nothing is more rewarding than encountering someone from an audience in the future and they tell me how the presentation helped them.
You might be thinking, “But everyone prepares this way!” Well, no, they don’t. I’ve worked with countless speakers, coaches, and consultants over the past 35 years. Very few go the extra mile to truly understand the audience and leverage key details to make their presentations as impactful as possible.
The three steps fit together and will help you discover your true audience. These steps will help you gain the insight you need into what they want, so you can deliver for them.
Thanks for listening to the podcast. I’d like to offer you a free tool — the 3D Presentation Speech Planning Template.
You can put this template to work immediately to guide yourself through this process of how you connect each message you deliver with the audience you are serving. Go to 3DPresentationsFramework.com to download this valuable tool.
In the episode, we dive into the specifics of my 6-Figure Roadmap. You’ll learn how to build a 6-figure business. It’s quite possible you can do this in less than 120 days using just a single speaking engagement as the launch pad (that was my journey).
Let’s take a deep-dive into the first two steps: 1) listen to the client and 2) respond to the client’s need.
As a valued listener, I’d like to offer you a free copy of my e-book, 52 Speaker Secrets. The book offers 52 different things you can do when you step in from of the room and engage with clients. Go to 52SpeakerSecrets.com to get your free copy!

Being the owner of an office or a company that has a reputation to live up to, it is essential in the first place to have cleaning staff on call, because it so often happens that cleanliness gets overlooked. However, for most people it’s a difficult proposition to have permanent staff for this purpose on their payroll due to financial reasons. For them, professional cleaners are the best solution. Let’s see how your office stands to benefit from them.
Firstly, the sight of overflowing garbage bins is best reserved for back alleys with stray cats, not the office. The smelly bathrooms matter too, significantly. You wouldn’t want your employees working with revulsion at the back of their minds. Plus, with the free time now available to the employees who previously would have tidied up the office; productivity as well as performance increases. This leads to more profits for your company. Additionally, when the building has been cleaned by industrial cleaners, there’s no room for germs and infections. And lastly, the most important point of it all, your clients. You’re bound to crack more deals with a clean and impeccable office setup than a disorganized junkyard.
When you opt for commercial cleaning services, make sure that they fit the bill, and not just in terms of money. Here are some suggestions which should help;
Variety of services: The cleaning company should be flexible enough to accommodate all kinds of services needed, not just plain brushing and scrubbing. They’re professionals after all, and should have proper equipment to carry out various tasks.
Flexibility: They have to work according to your schedule and not the other way round. Most of the reputable ones will work out an itinerary which will include not getting in your way during work hours. If you find the company refusing to change schedule, look for others.
Reviews and recommendations: Nothing adds to a company’s reputation than good reviews and recommendations for industrial cleaning. Most of these companies will have an online presence as well, so you can see for yourself how good they are.
Emergency accommodations: Any good professional cleaning company will definitely pay heed to last minute requests for unanticipated reasons, like an impromptu party, or on a serious note, a board meeting. Some even have dedicated help lines that are manned 24/7, so you can reach out to them at any point of time.
Certifications: you should check if the company has all the required certifications, like the ISO 9008:2001 certificate, as well as certain standard practices and methods.
The staff: There’s really no need to stress on this. Expect politeness, compliance, and responsibility as a pre-requisite, as you would in any professional employee.
After many years of living in their home, this client was ready to tackle redecorating the living room. We were able to make the case that the living room, dining room and staircase all needed to be done together and the homeowner agreed. One of the greatest concerns we had was the lighting and fortunately we were able to devise a way to conceal it without damaging any of the existing finishes. Our approach was to restore the shell and to furnish the room with contemporary pieces that complimented the space and maximized its use. Textiles and the elegant rug in the living room were primarily by Jack Lenor Larsen. To preserve the original mahogany floor and the furnishings, an electric exterior shade was added that drops whenever sunlight strikes the rear elevation of the house. (2007-2008)

I have also noticed though that I feel distant lately. I just feel kind of airy, like I am watching my life instead of participating in it. I know that some of you ppl know about this kinda shit, so I thought I would ask if this is just a normal effect of the meds, or if I should schedule a more immediate appointment with my Dr.? My next appointment isn't supposed to be for about 3 weeks.
"You know, DRZ, if this was the Revolutionary War, I'd be shooting you in the face with a musket."- TT
It can be an effect of the meds, depending on what you are taking. You can feel apathetic and disconnected from your emotions. If it's a feeling you don't like, by all means, see the doc and talk about adjusting. I have been on an antidepressant before that made me feel disconnected and apathetic. I felt like I was depressed, only I couldn't really tell because the meds masked the worst of it. A caveat is, it can be a bad idea to fuck with what is working. I am thinking of bipolar disorder, in which people start to feel better and go off their meds and all hell breaks loose. The idea of meds should be the minimum necessary for you to be functional. That said, it's a good idea to get therapy and build distress tolerance and emotion regulation skills. If you are wanting to get your feelings back, you want to be able to cope with them.
what mousie said. it would be unethical for several different reasons for us to diagnose or treat you here. that being said, i would call the doc and run it by him/her - and also start working with a competent therapist. you may need to check out a couple before finding one that really clicks with you. you wouldn't necessarily marry the first person you date, and the therapist/client relationship is another pretty intimate one (although for different reasons, one hopes).
I have also noticed though that I feel distant lately. I just feel kind of airy, like I am watching my life instead of participating in it ~
Totally the meds - I suggest giving it time and seeing if it stays that way before getting on the "let's adjust your dosage / ween you off and on to something else" merry go round. Your life is going great. Jesus fucking christ I would pay 60$ for that airy disconnected apathetic feeling you've got going, honestly. Caring about things is fucked.
It takes awhile for the brain stuff to equal out, non? "Life going great" sounds better than "my arms feel like they're being electrocuted" or "I bit my mother to death". If shrinks were real scientists / healers I'd agree with the "unethical" position, but they're insane evil nonhumans that masturbate to the thought of ruining people's lives as an experiment, so, best limiting your exposure to them, namsayin.
Sounds like you need to get laid brah. C'mon you expected at least one pithy asylumesque response right?
The cognizant part of your brain is the last stop on a runaway train line that goes back to whatever you started meds for in the first place.
For example, *meth floods 1200 times more dopamine across the "gateways" than regular ol' amphetamine, and your cerebellum's response is to let a shitload of receptors get "hijacked" and re-tune themselves to only respond to meth.
Dopamine is pretty complex stuff, but the main attribute is as a "happy" chemical. Every time you've ever jacked off, you kick-started a little squirt of dopamine into your brain. Or satisfied your hunger, or thirst.
Consider that those hijacked receptors normally are for things like enjoyment of a slice of pie, a whiff of clean pussy etc. and suddenly they're sorta ripped up by the roots, turned around to face the glare of this new torrent of dopamine stimulus - and they'll never go back.
Immediately, all they crave is more o' that stuff, etc. until they drop you in your hole and stick a chunk of marble with your name and epitaph above you.
With very few exceptions, ALL drugs work that way. They just sorta start a chain reaction that leads to physical effects, but your only awareness of the physical effects is in the cognizant part of your brain - which is primarily affected by dopamine. It's a weird merry-go-round.
Sometimes dopamine receptors can be "reclaimed," depending on what you were doing and how long you did it for, and most importantly: your genetics. (It helps to pick your parents wisely, I'm told.)
Here's another example: nicotine. Nicotine is unique in that it does two things at the same time: if you're tense, it calms you down. If you're tired, it perks you up. But ask a smoker of twenty years or more how it feels about a month into going cold turkey, and they'll tell you that both of those things are going on at the same time. In the absence of nicotine, their dopamine receptors are going haywire. They're tense AND tired...
And it takes about a year or more for those receptors to retune themselves, but they do. Ask a former smoker how their sense of smell was affected. (That's a big one.)
In your case, all this was just a preamble to this advice: give it time. LOTS of time. Endure. Don't start pasting bandaids on your brain just yet (especially antidepressants, which have their own bizarre cycle - just ask anybody who started taking Xanax for nervousness how they feel about a week after quitting, and they'll tell you they're FAR more wired than they ever thought about being before they took Xanax...)
It's just cycles your brain has to go through, and your cognizant brain is the last stop in a long line of changes, most of which you can't even "feel."
Thanks, but I was just expounding on what Mister Freign said. He deserves any credit, because he had it right.
They are called murder/suicide pills for a reason. Read the warning labels inside the box for proof.
Read the insert included in the packaging. FFS. By law they have to provide the list of symptoms that can come about from taking the pills. Goddamn it, this sort of shit is real and documented. Have you ever even bothered to read it even once?
Your the one taking the damned "crazy pills" and I'm the nut for telling you to read the warning labels so as to educate yourself? Really?
Tefl, you are wasting your time. You are talking at a boy with a history of taking questionable drugs because he accepts someone's word that they'll make him "feel better". Meth, crack, prescribed pharmaceuticals - what do they all have in common? He chooses to surrender rationality in favor of uninformed acceptance of their "benefits", simply because someone tells him how good they are.
I was joking, because there is a thread about you and conspiracy theories and I first heard about the dangers of psychotropic drugs on "coast to coast" .
I am well aware that some meds can do that, but I am not on any SSRI's, I have read the inserts on my drug, and it has very limited side effects.
I was mostly just wondering if I should ask a doctor about it, but it seems to have subsided on its own a bit, like friegn and Genie said it might.
Also, Simon, I spent 18 years "Just dealing with it" via, therapy, and such. It didn't work, at every turn I ended up getting worse, I have a very real mental illness, and there is nothing childish about taking meds to keep that in check. Also, I never took Meth, because someone "told" me it would make me feel better, I took it the first time because I was smoking refer, drinking PBR and someone offered it. I took it every other time, because it DID make me feel better.
Also also, Simon just because you are as old and crazy as gary busey's ball sack, doesn't mean you know everything.
That's HERESY!! Of course SS knows everything - he has demonstrated that hundreds of times! Nobody would know anything at all if it wasn't for SimpleSimonismⓇ!
"Republicans: the party that brought us 'Just Say No.' First as a drug policy, then as their entire platform." -Stephen Colbert -
I've often freely stated that I know a little bit about a whole lot of subjects, a great deal about a very few, and the thing I know best is that there is always more to learn.
That said, my previous assessment above is based upon your own statements regarding your history of drug abuse, and your apparent continuing pattern of the same. Yes, alcohol is a drug.
...I never took Meth, because someone "told" me it would make me feel better, I took it the first time because I was smoking refer, drinking PBR and someone offered it.
I have also noticed though that I feel distant lately. I just feel kind of airy, like I am watching my life instead of participating in it. I know that some of you ppl know about this kinda shit, so I thought I would ask if this is just a normal effect of the meds, or if I should schedule a more immediate appointment with my Dr.? My next appointment isn't supposed to be for about 3 weeks. ...
There is no better example of "that was then, this is now" than when someone truly makes the effort to get clean. The longer "now" becomes, the less "then" has anything to do with it. And that saves your ass.
I've been there, and I did it with "Cognitive Behavior Therapy" (CBT), acupuncture and nothing else. No meds, no 12-step, no meetings, counseling etc. Fortunately, I didn't need it.
Acupuncture is absolutely amazing for helping heal your brain. If you've never had it, go through the phone book and find one from China. Don't fuck around. I tried three non-chink acupuncturists before finding my soulmate.
I look down and see about a hundred needles sticking out from various parts of my body, and it blows me away that I can't feel one of them. I didn't feel 'em going in and I don't feel 'em coming out. And every single time I walk out of there feeling like somebody dipped my soul in Dr. Bronner's peppermint soap and gave it a good rinse.
It's hard to describe, but it works. It's got about umpteen thousand years of experience behind it, too. That doesn't hurt. Nobody has said it actually harms anybody, if that helps. It makes it a lot easier to handle the heebie-jeebies, that's for sure.
i freaking LOVE dr, bronner's peppermint soap. the label alone can occupy you if you forget to bring the newspaper in with you to have some "quality time".
One of the synonyms for sober is clearheaded. You did say you are feeling "distant, kind of airy, & like I am watching my life instead of participating in it." Do you think you are "clearheaded" with those symptoms?
'Concerned Women for America (CWA) is grateful to God that the Swedish Supreme Court has decided to protect religious freedom and freedom of speech by acquitting a Pentecostal pastor charged with a "hate crime" for criticizing homosexuality from the pulpit.'
Can you spot the Bag Monster?You see them all the time. They’re a filthy nuisance, cruising down sidewalks, nesting in trees and flying between Center City buildings. No, I’m not talking about pigeons—plastic bags are the menace I speak of. Last Thursday they weren’t just part of the background; they were the main attraction.
Thousands upon thousands of plastic bags were on display at City Hall as part of the national Bag Monster Tour. Donning a full-body costume made of plastic bags, Andy Keller combines high-energy activism and shocking “installations” to make people aware that the average American uses about 500 of these bags per year, most of which end up in landfills or oceans.
Many people passing through on their lunch breaks stopped to take pictures of the bags with their cell phones or to talk to the Bag Monster himself. At one point, he darted across 15th Street to snag a bag as it skipped down the sidewalk. Philadelphia is just one of more than a dozen stops on Keller’s cross-country tour that began last month in San Francisco.

I was looking at a collection of images of Bloom’s taxonomy today and realized that I wanted a simple but more apt drawing that would capture my beliefs about how the taxonomy relates to learning. I had recently read some interesting thoughts about the fact that the taxonomy was not strictly conceived as a hierarchy:
Bloom et al. discussed at length their decision to apply an Aristotelian categorization method in their taxonomy. The choice was significant, because an Aristotelian method creates distinct, bounded categories ordered by complexity without the hierarchical assumption that higher-level categories always entail instantiation of those lower in the taxonomy (e.g., when evaluating, it is not always necessary to first apply and synthesize). Moreover, Aristotelian categorization emphasizes that these groupings are closely related and difficult to tease apart. . . . however, the division of the taxonomy of educational objectives into classes representing lower order … and higher order thinking … has prevailed in research.
This captures more-or-less my thoughts that students can access learning by entering the taxonomy anywhere. Think about the Suzuki method of learning music, where children are not first introduced to the knowledge of the system of reading music, but instead are given the opportunity to create music. Or about Montessori schools where experiential activity that could be called creativity precedes knowledge.
It’s been almost three weeks since I hopped a train in Emeryville for my 9 week sojourn on the banks of the mighty Mississippi. While it’s good to see old friends and to be working on a theatre project, I’m feeling pretty lonely for my sweet Anna. We talk every day, of course, but it’s not the same as knowing the love of your life could appear at your side any moment and give you a squeeze. So, to help pass my days and to feel a bit more connected to my Oakland home, I’m committing to a little Back To Oakland blogging activity for the next six weeks.
We drank some swell Oakland coffee here in Moline for about a week and a half after I arrived. We started with The Sermon by Verve which I picked up at Modern Coffee just before I hopped on Amtrak. (I brewed several cups of The Sermon on the train in my little french press.) Once the Verve beans were gone we tore in to the two different bags of Blue Bottle beans: Hayes Valley Espresso and Roman Espresso. All three coffees were tasty, tart, fruity, and worth carrying across country in my suitcase. Jon and I enjoyed trying them in cappucino and ristretto. When we ran out we moved on to an African bean from Intelligentsia, delivered by one of Jon’s music faculty friends, straight from Chicago. We agreed that the African beans in this particular roast could have benefitted from blending with some of the South American beans that balance out the three blended coffee’s I brought from Oakland.
Now that the coffee is gone I’m looking for other Oakland diversions to keep me happy. I’ve enjoyed following several Oakland twitterers. I feel like I am generally in touch with what’s going on in the neighborhood when I see tweets from @vsmoothe, @oaklandbecks, @dto510, @davidcolburn, @moderncoffee, @danapalooza, @farleyseast, @katymurphy, and @egratto. They provide an eclectic POV that satisfies my need to know that Oakland is still humming. I had a fun twitter conversation that I’ll share a little more about tomorrow, involving a famous Oaklander from Anna’s class at Skyline High.
One month ago I took few pictures of this spruce. I was covered with a lot of new freshly opened buds. Just month later tree looked like this today. One can clearly see tree is happy and fertiliser I'm using is working. I always prefer more growth, healthy tree. I think when you perform any styling work with healthy vigorous tree you can push it with less risk. A lot of editing and refinement will follow with this spruce during next couple of years.
There has been several unjustified claims from several sources I cant smile, based on this picture . Those claims were based on few of my last selfie Me-Tree pictures from some of the later posts. To fight those claims Im adding picture of myself smiling which is clearly proving contrary. I hope it will stop any further accusations once and for all.

Happy Mother’s day…..I admittedly have a hard time with Mother’s day. I don’t look forward to this one day every year. I no longer have expectations of what it should be for myself. I don’t expect my family to go all out and make me feel *special* on this day. I don’t know that I ever really did? (maybe so and I have blocked it out). I think you set yourself up for failure when you do that….if we have done something special on this day it’s because I have planned it myself…and that’s ok…because I think (probably…maybe) I am a control freak and I need to know what is going on..( I don’t think I like surprises…when I was a kid I had never experienced a “Good” surprise..other than Christmas morning.) …I also think that I didn’t become a Mother because I wanted to feel special one day a year.� I don’t believe It’s part of the package…….I gain more from them everyday..whether it’s a good or bad day with my kids..that the one silly day probably doesn’t matter.
I also struggle with Mother’s day probably because I am not self focused ( as most women aren’t) and focusing on myself..doesn’t seem right……but I also don’t have a Mother to celebrate. I don’t have a� relationship with my mother. It’s not an anger thing…it’s nothing thing. When you are indifferent …..and realize that you were an unwanted child….and you deal with that loss. So I realized a few years ago, I would rather give of myself.. when you don’t have someone to give that honor too..or celebrate it makes this day…..well�…less. �Less than it should be. I will have to wait quite a few years to celebrate generations of mothers getting together and seeing the positive�impact they have had on eachothers lives…God willing..I will celebrate with my children and their children so I can finally celebrate.
But what I realized this morning is that I am so judgemental of BAD mothers. I can forgive just about anything..any hurt in my life….I have even forgiven my abusers & mother. But�I struggle with those moms you see on the street yelling at their kids…or the ones you know are neglecting their kids..sending them� ( to my house) anywhere away from them…so they can indulge in whatever they feel will make them feel better. I need to let that go and love them. I judge them because there is this deep seeded fear within myself that I am just like them. There I�said it. It’s an irrational fear right? I mean I am involved in my kids lives..it’s all consuming for me….I try really hard to be an overachiever especially when it comes to being a mom. The problem with this job is that�you can never be perfect. You can never get 100%. There is no black and white instruction book. So I keep score within myself…{that is never a good thing} I even recognize traits within myself that�are like my own mother. I can’t believe that I don’t. There is nobody 100% bad. I have to embrace those things and use them for good. Even if my Mother was a bad mother…that�doesn’t mean I will be..or am. I have had some really BAD moments..yes..believe me my kids remind me of them….even if I didn’t keep track myself (to beat myself up) they would remind me. It’s kind of like dieting..we can’t go “Cold Turkey” you always have to eat so you have to manage your food …..same with parenting..once you become a parent..you are in no matter what..it’s an exclusive club that you can never leave. Take it good or bad it there…..like breathing.��The really�great thing about being a mom? It’s never to late. It’s never to late to change. No matter how old your kid is…….you can be the mom you should be..the mom God called us to be. Someday I have to go before God and be judged for what kind of mother I was. Afterall he loves his {my}�children more than me…he loaned them to me….All I will be able to say is that I did my best…and I hope I was a good and faithful servant. Each of my children will have their own “truths” about how they were raised…those are already becoming apparent in these teen years…and all I can do is love them through it until they become parents. Then they will understand the strength, stamina,Faith & Love that is takes to be a parent. Not one of us can do it alone…We need God to be successful parents.
So many times I confess of my sins to my kids. many times it doesn’t involve them. I just want them to know..I don’t have it together. we all struggle all the time..every minute. Some of my kids understand…already. They can take my “confessions” and apply it to situations in the own lives. Others� take it in one ear�and out the other. Its’ amazing to see either way. I already know which of my children will have a harder road ahead of them….it makes my heart break…but that is their cross to carry…..I can’t do it for them.
I am very happy to be a mom…I have learned more about myself than I ever would have had I not been a mom. I also understand the sacrifice of Jesus much more now that I am a parent than I did when I was younger….Why…because as a Mom I would do anything ..sacrifice my own life for my child…and to think that God thought I was worthy enough to let his own son be killed…well this is really a day to honor my faithful Father.� I understand a fraction of his pain…{because I can’t possibly understand as much as him}.�I can’t pretend to understand why he trusted me with 6 beautiful babies..his children….when half the time I don’t feel competent to care for them. I can’t pretend that I do this all on my own. So I am HAPPY. Happy to�have a faithful father..who�makes me worthy. I am happy that I get this opportunity. I am happy that I have these�struggles…(even though my behind & muffin top�shows it all..they are delirious!)….because it makes the good times so worth it. I am happy because God wants me….I am�no longer an unwanted child. I belong to him.
First time I read your blog I knew we had a lot in common. It is just plin scary how much. God bless you and yours,

The Gatlinburg Convention center project includes more than 75,000 sq. ft. of convention and meeting space. The scope of this project involves the demolition of most of the existing facility, except for the preservation of the historic Mills auditorium. New facilities are being added, which surround the preserved auditorium. The Mills auditorium project is adjacent to and integrated with the existing Gatlinburg Convention Center. The new facility, when complete, will include large meeting rooms, pre-function areas, a new kitchen, service corridors, and storage areas, and will incorporate the existing Mills Auditorium.
Our engineers performed an economic analysis and life-cycle cost study, in conjunction with a review of existing mechanical systems, to determine the most economical mechanical system design for this facility. In addition, direct digital controls for the new mechanical systems are being provided.
Our design effort includes a plumbing system to service the facility, which includes gas-fired water heaters for the kitchens and restroom areas. We also designed a sprinkler system to accommodate the new center.
This project involves demolition of a large portion of the existing building, renovation of the existing auditorium, and designing the new building systems to integrate with the existing convention center spaces. Each of these phases could be a stand-alone project, and therefore, make this a unique design challenge. As with every project, we customize our
Urban Rangers is an after-school employment program for high school students enrolled in the Yonkers Public School system. Funded by, and working closely with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, this unique program trains youth in roles usually played by professional rangers. These young people work at events, educating the public about conservation and the need for habitat restoration. One of their work sites is the daylighted Van der Donck Park in downtown Yonkers, recently designated by U.S. Fish and Wildlife as an Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnership.
Similar to the Green Team, this program focuses on leadership, group dynamics, construction skills and conservation education. Youth work on a variety of projects for the National Park Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, including construction of a Turtle Pond at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, installation of owl boxes, building a pollinator garden and a bat garden at Floyd Bennet Field National Historic Site, and designing and planting a mini-wildlife refuge near School 13 in Yonkers.
The Urban Rangers meet Tuesdays after school from 3:30-6pm at the Groundwork office and some weekends and holidays in Gateway National Recreation Area.

"The student is half afraid to meet one of the great philosophers face to face. He feels himself inadequate and thinks he will not understand him. But if he only knew, the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible than his modern commentator. The simplest student will be able to understand, if not all, yet a very great deal of what Plato said; but hardly anyone can understand some modern books on Platonism." - C.S. Lewis, On the Reading of Old Books

I've tested the changes using my Android tablet with Opera, Firefox, and Chrome browsers. I don't have a smartphone or any Apple devices to test with, though, so if you access the site on an iPad or a smartphone and see any issues, please let me know about them so I can try to get them resolved.
The next part of Phase II is to separate the author information from the links for each work. So, the page for each author will contain a list of the author's works which are indexed on the site, along with basic information about the author and links to general information. The links to etexts and texts for purchase will be moved to their own, individual pages, instead of being crammed together on one page (this isn't a problem for, say, Tyrtaeus, but for Plato and Aristotle the pages get pretty long). You will probably see this change occur a few authors at a time.
UPDATE: This part may require a more in-depth redesign than I was originally planning and may not be completed until late 2018 or even later.
Index type, language of text, and reading list are now selected from dropdown menus instead of by links in the header
The menu block in the top right no longer lists webrings or options for navigation (both had been disabled anyway)
A couple of the URL parameters have changed (but don't worry - links and bookmarks using the old format will still work)
After Phase II, Phase III will involve changes intended to make the site easier for me to maintain and update in the future. These changes should be fairly transparent to visitors (except that the presentation of content will become more uniform), so I likely won't be announcing the start or completion of them.

This is Chapter 3 of Direct Citizen Action: How We Can Win the Second American Revolution Without Firing a Shot
There are three basic approaches to changing public policy: politics (elections and lobbying), direct citizen action and violence. We can quickly rule out violence as morally repugnant, inefficient and unpredictable.
Political action has rarely in human history caused government to shrink in size and power. The natural tendency of government is to grow and expand its powers. The events of 2008–2010 illustrate that. Over time, it will tend to tax and spend more, hire more people and assume more power over our lives, liberty and property. Government policies change continually but if you look closely, it is almost always in the direction of bigger government. If you favor bigger government, you really don’t have to do anything. Just sit back and enjoy the show. By the natural laws of politics, governments will tend to grow. If you check back in five years, it is highly likely that the government will be bigger and more powerful. Government in America has grown enormously since about 1917, the start of American involvement in World War I. No coincidence there; war grows the state.
By its nature, the state is the means by which some people can impose the costs of achieving their goals onto unwilling others. As Frédéric Bastiat put it, “Government is the great fiction, through which everybody endeavors to live at the expense of everybody else.” The desire to impose costs on others is virtually limitless. Thus, governments tend to grow over time.
There are five main reasons for this which are, unfortunately, structural features of political life:
rational apathy – the incentive some people have to increase the size of the state outweighs the incentive the rest of us have to fight them;
government control over political ideas – the state uses its control over schools and other idea-disseminating institutions to propagate support for further government growth;
government creates its own demand – because the state’s various interventions into the market economy always fail (e.g., health care), ironically, they increase the demand of the uninformed majority for even further interventions to fix the problems caused by the prior interventions;
the productivity of the mixed economy – given the inherent tendency of the state to grow, only extreme dissatisfaction among the populace will rouse them to act; however, even a partially free market produces enough wealth to mollify the people;
government has a monopoly on the use of legal force – government grows because it can. Given the universal human desire to accomplish goals with the least possible exertion, politicians have an irresistible urge to use the state’s powers to continually expand the amount of wealth they control. Anyone who objects can always appeal to the politicians’ judges and can expect to be told, “Get lost!”
Since it is in the structural DNA of government to grow, it is nearly impossible to persuade its officials to reverse that tendency or to persuade the voters to elect candidates who intend to shrink government. The last time a mass political movement was able to achieve power and shrink government was Thomas Jefferson’s velvet revolution of 1800!
Ron Paul’s campaign for president in 2007–8 showed how difficult it is to elect a candidate who favors smaller government. In spite of over 100,000 campaign workers and $30,000,000 and an articulate candidate with 20 years in Congress and a sterling personal life and record of accomplishment, he received less than ten percent in every Republican primary election. The system is thoroughly stacked against anyone who would attempt to reform it from within.
The main function of national elections in this country is to give the people the illusion that they are in charge and can change policy whenever necessary. However, the basic policies never seem to change. Elections allow people to blow off steam and thus serve as a safety valve for the regime that allows them to rule us for another four years.
With respect to the upcoming congressional elections this year, a Patriot candidate would need as much as two million dollars to run a competitive race for the House. Very few have that kind of money or can raise it. More likely, the Republican challengers this year will be party loyalists funded and controlled by the plutocrats and GOP establishment.
I know these are harsh realities to accept. They contradict what we have been taught in school and told to believe in endless TV ads urging us to vote and participate in the political process. However, to win this fight, you will have to be as clear-eyed as our adversaries are about the realities of power politics. That’s how the political class got all that power in the first place: by seeing things clearly and not being fooled by myths and clichés.

Le Havre is a major European port located in Upper Normandy at the mouth of the Seine. The city was built at the entrance to the port. Heavily bombed during the Second World War, it was rebuilt by Auguste Perret. The postwar reconstruction, exemplary in its process and in its integration of different building typologies, has since been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site. The André Malraux Museum of Modern Art was built with Jean Prouvé, and Oscar Niemeyer’s iconic building.
The Southampton quay, in former times the prestigious point of departure for the ship Le France on its journey towards New York, serves as the city\'s maritime facade as well as the entrance for the industrial port. In almost complete disuse for more than twenty years, this vast space extending for about a mile is currently the subject of a transformation project. The objective is to convert it into a public space that links together city and port.
The focus will be on envisaging the transformation of theses public spaces, of their uses and their spatial composition, but also on the setting up of an ensemble of buildings for the port center. These new buildings and spaces should be understood and approached in connection with the exceptional city neighborhoods adjacent built by Auguste Perret.
The particularity of the workshop is based on the alternation of two points of view: that of the landscape architect Michel Desvigne with that of the architect Inessa Hansch. Through the combination of their varying skills and expertise, the goal is to develop a command over spatial composition, while understanding how certain constructions shape places that inform and orient and animate space.
In Le Havre, mastery over scale is critical. The eyes must continually adapt, moving from the sea horizon to domestic spaces and back. The composition linked traditionally with port facilities and reconstructed cities takes on here a particular and essential quality: urban space replaces that of industry. Moreover, this project is emblematic of the vast changes taking place in metropolitan centers throughout the world. There are indeed numerous industrial and maritime spaces, situated on the banks of rivers or facing the sea, which today are undergoing, or have already undergone, the transformation into becoming a public space. These renewals and conversions are fascinating in their scope and individual circumstances. Places once given over to work and forbidden to the public now open onto their cities, joining again with the natural geography. If such reconciliations are often welcome and joyful, we have also noticed a trite aspect to certain sites that have become merely background scenery for consumerist cities. It is along these lines that we must continue to question ourselves about the function and meaning of these large reconquered spaces: their architecture, relevance, and longevity depend on it.
The workshop unfolds just like the actual situation: the program, phases, rhythms, documents, and support materials are those that have been determined by the contracting authority.
Halfway through the workshop a trip to Le Havre will provide the opportunity of experiencing and examining the actual situation up-close.
Among the participants in the workshop will be the project stakeholders, city officials, the mayor, the port authorities, and a number of experts (the close observation of the work of Perret, Prouvé, and Niemeyer will indeed be crucial). The trip will then continue to Paris for the study of major spaces.

In the wake of the lethal Odessa fire on May 2, President Vladimir Putin and Chancellor Angela Merkel agreed by telephone on Sunday afternoon “to take effective measures, including through the OSCE in the first place, aimed at easing tensions in Ukraine. In this connection, Swiss Federal President and OSCE Chairperson-in-Office Didier Burkhalter will arrive in Moscow on May 7.”
This amounts to an invitation for the Swiss to exercise their longstanding neutrality in European conflicts to keep the warring sides apart in eastern and southern Ukraine; prevent the violence; and create the conditions in which a durable settlement between the Ukrainian regions may be negotiated on a new constitutional basis. In short, an international police force.
That’s an option which the Kremlin has been quietly circulating to the European governments for days. The Obama Administration has refused to accept it because the deployment casts doubt on the capacity of the Ukrainian security forces, and restricts the special forces who caused the May 1 Odessa fire. From the American point of view, too, such a European force is exactly what US officials don’t want because it’s – State Department expletives deleted – European.
The F word in Washington mouths is the Eu word in the OSCE’s title – the Organization for Security and Economic Cooperation in Europe. First created between 1973 and 1975, the 34 founding parties to the Helsinki Final Act creating the OSCE were almost all European – except for Turkey, Canada, and the US. There are now 57 treaty states, the additional number resulting from the breakup of Yugoslavia, and then the Soviet Union. The three non-European exceptions haven’t changed – Turkey, the US and Canada.
The US continues to keep troops in Europe, by invitation. Turkey is the only OSCE member state to occupy a European state without invitation. Following an invasion of 1974, about 30,000 Turkish forces remain on Cypriot territory, where their presence is unlawful according to successive United Nations resolutions over forty years. The Turkish occupation and partition of Cyprus is armed, financed and supported by the US. It has been justified by both as preventative action to secure the lives and rights of the Turkish-speaking population of Cyprus; and to prevent an earlier putsch against the Cypriot government leading to a union between Cyprus and Greece.
The OSCE is chaired on an annually rotating basis by the foreign minister of one of the member states; the present chairperson-in-office (CIO) is Didier Burkhalter, the Swiss Federal President and Foreign Minister. His OSCE term runs for the calendar year 2014. Next year Serbia will hold the post.
The OSCE headquarters is in Vienna, where a ministerial-level permanent council meets every week. They delegate day to day operations to a secretary-general, and there have been five of them to date – a German, a Czech, a Frenchman and two Italians. The present secretary-general is Lamberto Zannier (right), an Italian.
“We help bridge differences between states and build trust through co-operation” is the way the OSCE describes its mission today. “With its specialized institutions, expert units and network of field operations, the OSCE addresses a range of issues that have an impact on our common security, including arms control, terrorism, good governance, energy security, human trafficking, democratization, media freedom and minority rights.”
One of the questions Merkel and Putin have agreed to ask Burkhalter to answer on Wednesday is the N word – how neutral can the OSCE be in the present Ukrainian conditions? The question has special sensitivity because of the detention in Slavyansk, in the Donetsk region, of a group of military observers, whose credentials, mission, and status have been widely confused with the OSCE’s civilian operation, the Special Monitoring Mission.
The military men — 4 Germans, 1 Czech, 1 Dane, 1 Pole and a Swede — were detained at Slavyansk on the evening of April 25 (picture left). The Swede was released quickly for medical treatment of his diabetes. The others were released on May 1, after a week of negotiations led by the Kremlin’s special emissary, Vladimir Lukin (picture right).
The credentials of the soldiers to be where they were, out of uniform, doing what they were doing, were not issued by the OSCE, nor did they report to OSCE. They were a military inspection team invited by the government in Kiev, according to a European military inspection protocol known as the Vienna Document of 2011.
The military inspections provided for by the Vienna Document have been designed for cross-border purposes, not for internal conflicts verging on civil war. According to a US government statement in mid-April, “Russia has committed grievous violations of international law, and this is the background against which we are seeking to understand their deployment of troops on the Ukrainian border.”
A week later, the ostensible purpose of the detained Vienna Document men in Slavyansk was to look for evidence of cross-border Russian involvement of the kind alleged by the governments in Kiev and Washington. That foreign field officers without Russian fluency, accompanied by interpreters speaking in Kiev or western accents, could accomplish this after dark in Slavyansk was improbable to the group which detained them. So they called them NATO spies. US and UK newspapers claimed they were operating under the OSCE mandate. None of these claims was correct.
The OSCE explained its mandate in eastern Ukraine on March 21. “The Permanent Council decided in a special session on Ukraine today to deploy an OSCE Special Monitoring Mission of international observers to Ukraine: the mission’s aim is to contribute to reducing tensions and fostering peace, stability and security. Throughout the country, the mission will gather information and report on the security situation as well as establish and report facts regarding incidents, including those concerning alleged violations of fundamental OSCE principles and commitments. It will also monitor the human rights situation in the country, including the rights of national minorities. Facilitating dialogue on the ground to promote normalization of the situation is a further task of the mission.”
“The mandate of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission forsees [sic] deployment throughout Ukraine, to the east, south and west of the country. Advance teams will be deployed within 24 hours of the adoption of this decision. Initially, the mission will consist of 100 civilian monitors and may expand by a total of up to 400 additional monitors. The monitoring mission will be deployed for a period of six months, its mandate can be renewed for further six month periods by decision of the Permanent Council if requested by Ukraine.”
The special monitors have credentials which have been accepted by the opposition to the Kiev government. On one occasion, a group of special monitors were held for a credential check in eastern Ukraine, but they were not detained.
On April 14, Burkhalter met with the special monitoring mission in Kiev. He announced: “In order to enhance transparency and the level of accurate information about ongoing developments, the Mission in addition to providing reports for OSCE participating States has also started a daily public reporting, he continued.”
So far there have been fifteen such field reports; the last of them runs through April 30. There has been no field report since the Odessa events of May 1.
Initially in charge of the special monitoring mission was Adam Kobiacki, a Polish diplomat who is OSCE’s assistant secretary-general for operations. Burkhalter then announced three appointments. Ertuğrul Apakan of Turkey was named Chief Monitor, with two deputies Mark Etherington of the United Kingdom and Alexander Hug of Switzerland.
The OSCE describes Apakan (below) this way: “Ambassador Apakan has had a longstanding diplomatic career, most recently as Permanent Representative of Turkey to the United Nations (2009 – 2012) and as Undersecretary, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (2006 – 2009).”
Omitted by the OSCE is Apakan’s role in the Turkish military occupation of Cyprus. When the invasion occurred, he was a junior official of the Turkish Foreign Ministry. In 1992, he was appointed Deputy Director General for Cyprus and Greece at the ministry, and in 1996 he was appointed the Turkish ambassador in northern Cyprus. He was there until 2000.
During his term he was one of the principal Turkish officials in charge of the occupation, along with several Turkish generals commanding the military units. According to reports of UN observer missions, European Union investigations, and judgements of the European Court of Human Rights, Apakan’s tenure was marked by systematic violations of most human rights, including ethnic cleansing, confiscation of property, police torture, and in the case of the shooting death of Solomos Solomou in August 2006, murder.
Mark Etherington (picture left), the second of OSCE’s appointments to run the monitoring mission in Ukraine, is described by the OSCE as having been “Team Leader in South Sudan and Team Leader for the UK Government Stabilisation Unit with field missions to various countries on behalf of the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.”
Omitted by the OSCE is Etherington’s career as a British army officer in the Parachute Regiment until 1991. Thereafter he was assigned to the European Community Monitor Mission during the NATO war on Yugoslavia. While in that post he was also assigned to Kosovo until 1995. In 2003 and 2004, Etherington was the British governor (“governorate coordinator”) in Wasit province in Iraq (picture right), where a battalion of Ukrainian troops was also serving. He then moved to the British command at Basra. From there he was assigned to the British Army’s field headquarters in Helmand province in Afghanistan.
Etherington reported on his career and testified to the lessons he learned in these wars during the official inquiry into the Iraq War. This was initiated in 2009 by the British Government and supervised by the House of Commons. Etherington gave his testimony in July 2010. He complained of American pressure on his operation; “the erosion of consent in Basra”; and the failure of the British command in the “business of what we would call Strategic Communications, the business of influencing the public in theatre to support your aims, to explain what it is you are trying to do and what’s going to happen. This, to me, had been wholly neglected, inexplicably neglected. I just didn’t get a sense we had had a serious stab at this.” That’s not stab in the regular paratrooper’s meaning. The term stabilisation in Etherington’s curriculum vitae is British Army for what the American Army calls pacification.
The second of the deputy chief monitors appointed to Ukraine is also a soldier. This is Alexander Hug, a Swiss national. According to the OSCE, “currently Head of Section/Senior Advisor at the OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, Alexander Hug has worked as Head of Human Rights & Gender Officer for EULEX Kosovo and has held various positions in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.”
In its latest appointment notice, the OSCE omits that Hug trained as a lawyer, then served as an officer in the Swiss Army. During his military service the OSCE reports elsewhere that he was a regional commander of a Swiss Army support unit for the OSCE in northern Bosnia and Herzegovina. He also served in Kosovo and in Hebron (Palestine).
According to Burkhalter of OSCE, “Ambassador Apakan, Mr. Etherington and Mr. Hug bring a wealth of experience and regional expertise to the Special Monitoring Mission as it enters its full deployment and operational stage. Under their leadership, I trust that the Special Monitoring Mission will contribute to fostering peace, stability and security and to reducing tensions on the ground in Ukraine.”
OSCE spokesmen with the special monitoring mission in Kiev and at the Vienna headquarters were asked whether they were aware of Apakan’s record in occupied Cyprus, Etherington’s military service in the Yugoslav, Iraq and Afghan wars, and Hug’s involvement in Bosnia, Palestine, and Kosovo.
Tatyana Baeva, an OSCE spokesman in Vienna, said her organization was in no position to respond because “it was the Swiss who made the appointment.”
Michael Bociurkiw (right), press officer for the Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, describes himself on the internet as “a social media expert and digital influencer”. He also publishes his opinions on Ukrainian politics. “Until now,” he reported on February 21, “there has been little doubt that Yanukovych has been taken his cues from Russian President Vladimir Putin — a man notoriously impervious to opprobrium from the West. Putin is incapable of seeing Ukraine outside his sphere of influence.”
On April 11, a few days before he started on the OSCE payroll, Bociurkiw published in the Canadian edition of Huffington Post: “The [Ukrainian presidential] elections could be seen by Moscow and its backers in Ukraine as a chance to destabilize the situation. If a pro-western candidate makes it past the first round on May 25 that could be reason enough for Russia to engineer the installation of a suitable replacement, even by force. (Kyiv is rife with rumours of a back-room deal between Russian President Vladimir Putin and former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, which would see the former political prisoner parachuted into the Presidency in exchange for a withdrawal from Crimea).”
Bociurkiw identifies his family as of Ukrainian origin, from the western part of the country. He said he has stopped publishing his opinion pieces on Ukraine since he took the OSCE job. He denies his publications demonstrate a lack of neutrality towards the pro-Russian opinions of Ukrainians in the regions he is monitoring.
Asked whether he and OSCE are aware of the careers of Apakan, Etherington and Hug in military pacification programmes in war zones, and in Apakan’s case, in violation of UN and EU resolutions, Bociurkiw said he himself is not aware of the career records, and promised a written reply. Bociurkiw was also asked whether the OSCE appointees’ military involvements qualify them to be neutral in eastern Ukraine. The responses were not available at publication time.
Apakan’s office was asked the same questions. The reply was: “We do not have the capacity to respond to all individual letters, but we will certainly take them into account in our work.”
Roland Bless, the spokesman for Swiss Minister Burkhalter at the OSCE in Vienna, was asked what the CIO knew of Apakan’s past when he put him in charge of the Ukrainian monitoring mission. “I don’t know”, Bless replied. In Bern today, Burkhalter said through a spokesman: “The Chief Monitor and his two deputies were nominated by their respective state authorities. The appointments followed the usual OSCE procedures. The three dispose of the relevant experiences and qualifications needed to fulfill their mandates in the framework of the Special Monitoring Mission. Special attention was paid to their previous experience in multilateral organizations.”

ARC Program Director, Dallas Rising (right), presents Cuddle Coats certificate to Everyday People co-owner, Liza (left).
Everyday People Clothing Exchange, the Cities’ hippest stores for vintage and second-hand clothes, has pledged not to buy or sell fur or fur-trimmed items at any of its three locations. Owners and sisters Kitty and Liza didn’t hesitate to make the commitment since they had always been apprehensive about dealing with fur items in the past. As Kitty explains: “We’re both huge animal people, we don’t eat meat, so it made sense for our business.”
Thanks to all the volunteers who helped make the Twin Cities premiere of Skin Trade, the most provocative documentary about fur production to date, at the Ritz Theater such an incredible success. And many thanks to the film’s director Shannon Keith, for hosting a fascinating Q&A session after the film.
Thank to our sponsors for their support of this important event with their donations of silent auction items and items for the goodie bags: Everyday People, Fabulous Furs (the world’s finest faux fur), LUSH, Vaute Couture, VegNews, Lantern Books, and Perseus Books.
Over 20 million animals suffer in U.S. laboratories every year. These innocent victims are subjected to addictive drugs, caustic chemicals, ionizing radiation, chemical and biological weapons, electric shock, deprivation of food and water, psychological torture, and many other horrors. World Laboratory Animal Liberation Week is the time when activists come together to make a difference for these animals.
The Animal Humane Society’s five area shelters provide impound services for over 20 cities in and around the metro area, including Afton, Minnesota. In September 2009, a group of Afton residents asked their City Council to review the animal control arrangement between Afton and AHS. This request arose from the discovery that in May 2009, seven cats were caught in live traps, taken to the AHS shelter in Woodbury, and euthanized the same day. By doing so, AHS failed to honor the five-day waiting period as required by Minnesota law. After looking into the matter, the Afton City Council voted unanimously to terminate its impound contract with AHS.
ARC has been busy getting humane education materials into the hands of teachers. In addition to our booth at the Education Minnesota Professional Conference, ARC offered Cruelty Free Circus Action Project packs to K-3 teachers.
The kits contained a lesson plan, student worksheets, and stickers, and they were snapped up quickly by educators eager to teach compassion for animals. We also sent middle school science teachers Frog Fact Files which are colorful kits filled with frog fact sheets covering topics ranging from alternatives to dissection to the lifecycle of a frog. Birdwatching Kits (as alternatives to chick hatching projects) were also sent out to teachers.
Besides our booth at the Pride Festival, ARC also marched in the Pride parade in Minneapolis. Marchers carried “Go Faux” flags and handed out suckers and stickers that said, “I fake it!” – all to encourage the parade audience to think about swearing off leather and fur. The stickers were a huge success!
A great group of ARC volunteers marched in the May Day Parade. Our theme, echoed in the green flags carried by marchers, was “go green, go veg.” Thanks to all the volunteers who staffed our booth at the festival in Powderhorn Park, marched in the parade, and made the day so successful!
These days it seems you can’t turn on a television or open a newspaper without seeing a story about the importance of going green. While there are many things you can do to go green, one vitally important action, adopting a plant-based diet, has been ignored by the media and promoters of events such as the Living Green Expo.
We recently posted some questions regarding the killing of about 130 cats that the Animal Humane Society reportedly “rescued” from a mobile home in St. Anthony, Minnesota. In response to ARC’s expressed concerns, and concerns expressed by many other animal advocates, the AHS board issued a form letter response on April 6.

It's so sweet and vintage looking. A really simple way to achieve that look is to stain Papertrey twill with the Vintage Tea Dye inks. Simply choose the white or cream twill...I'm using cream today.......and run the ink cube down the length of the twill. Voila, that's it. Instant vintage twill. You can even stamp words on the twill if you like, I love that look. Note: the ink cubes that I used are pretty dry so be sure to test out a little snippet of the twill with your ink cubes first. Next up, I used a $1 alphabet that I purchased at my local scrapbook store to spell out some words on my tag. When using the individual letter stamps, I like to spell out my words as much as possible, leaving blank spaces where the letters repeat. Using these types of stamps takes just a little bit more time but the results are so homemade and sweet looking.
Next up, I wanted a wax paper looking wrapping for my project. I reached for a Papertrey large glassine sack, wadded it all up so it was crinkly looking and then cut a square piece for my project using pinking shears.
I tied this square of glassine paper to my jelly jar that I'm using for a Valentine gift this year. Doesn't it look all crafty kitchen-y and cool? I'll be using that idea lots more for foodie gifts. I then tied my newly vintage twill around the jar, tying in a little sprig of glittery goodness that was leftover from some Christmas projects. Next up, I wanted to tie on my completed tag using red and white striped baker's twine from Martha Stewart (from Michael's). An easy way to attach tags using baker's twine is to thread the twine through a large needle...then work the needle under the layer of twill. It makes easy work of it.
The tag and heart doo dad pieces were part of the kit. You can really fancy up plain white shipping tags with stamping, glitter and embellishments. For my tag, I stamped it using the Vintage Tea Dye inks and hearts from Background Basics: Hearts. I love using the little cubes for actual stamped images, not just distressing the edges of projects. To the edges of my tag, I used a glue pen and added some Martha Stewart vintage gold glitter. Yummo! The stamped words on my tag tie in with my jelly....sweet & a little hot.....perfect sentiment for Valentine's Day, don't you think? I used two doo dads from the kit contents to make a layered heart that I distressed with the Vintage Tea Dye ink cubes.
Such a sweet little gift. It reminds me of something you'd pick up in a quaint little boutique on the corner. And there's no reason at all that you can't create the same look for your projects. It just takes a little creativity and some great crafting supplies.......and maybe a few hours in the kitchen. I think I need to make some more of these little sweetie pie gifts.......jelly jars, a block of cream cheese and a favorite box of crackers. Ohhhhh yes!
Wow, Mish - this is fabulous! I never tried directly inking the whole twill ribbon to "stain" it - very cool. Love your project, as always! :)
Okay, this is seriously sweet. I can see using this idea for all sorts of foody gifts. Thanks again for the inspiration to give a little more!

I have to say that I look foward to looking at you blog every day!! I usually look in the morning and if I see nothing new, I make sure to come back later to see if you have updated it with something beautiful and inspirational!
This is truly adorable...as usual. So what's in the jar anyway? Some type of pepper jelly? I'm sure it's gonna be a hit to the lucky recipient.
I follow your blog for some time now, rather silent, but I really want to tell you, I admire your creativity - love your projects - keep going! It is a pleasure to visit your blog!
Hey Mish, love (again) what you've done here. Question, though, do you know if they still sell that Martha Stewart baker's twine? I've been looking in my Mike's store and haven't been able to find it. I thought they might come out with the red/white again for V-day but no such luck, at least in my neck of the woods! And yes, what is in that jar? Red pepper jelly? or ???
So cute! I'd love to have the recipe for your jelly if you can share. I've been looking for a good one like that but haven't been successful yet.

The “Greatest Show on Earth” opened its 136th edition production in Oakland this past week, providing a truly wonderful evening of “old-fashioned” circus fun for the entire family. Yes, it is not like the circus shows of old, and yet is a fully entertaining production that everyone seemed to come away feeling good about. The famous three ring circus design has been reduced to one large all-encompassing ring of events that brings human and animal performers onto one gigantic stage. What is new is that the Ringling Brothers, Barnum and Bailey Circus has gone “modern media”, utilizing a huge 24 foot diameter brilliantly illuminated LED video screen, allowing the audience to get to experience and see animals, clowns, actors, and daredevils, in a way that you have never seen them before. I really like the big screen concept! You get to see close-up shots that you cannot see from your seat.
The “all access pre-show” allows everyone to come down on the circus performing floor (the floor of the auditorium) where the clowns and performers provide a hands-on experience that is truly up close and personal. For example, an animal trainer stands in an area that is approximately 50 feet across, surrounded by a tightly gathered circle of adults and children, watching intently while he explains how they train the elephants. In another “show and tell” performance, the trainer and his assistants led a small group of South American Alpaca’s along the ring in front of the spectators, encouraging them to pet them and to feel their marvelously soft fur. All over the arena’s floor, the circus entertainers engage the audience members in small groups, one-on-one, challenging them to dance and jiggle and jump and play with clowns and dancers and all sorts of characters. People were getting photographic shots of their kids mingling with the clowns and animals. Lots of people brought their cameras and took tons of photos. The Asian elephants (an endangered species) are worked, loved and protected at the same time by this wonderful group of caring performers. It seems to me that the performances of these animals are simpler than they used to be, probably in some fashion in deference to the demands of animal rights groups. You cannot go away from the show without a greater appreciation for these wonderful animals and grateful that a portion of your ticket price is going to help preserve these giant animals in the Center for Elephant Conservatism funded and run by this Circus family.
This year’s “Circus of Dreams” employs professional actors purporting to be a “lucky family” drawn from the audience to experience what it would be like to be magically drawn into the circus family to experience the stuff that dreams are made of. Former American Idle top-30 finalist “Jennifer Fuentes” leads this awestruck family from the audience to the center of the ring, allowing dad (played by Chuck Wagner) to realize his dream as a ringmaster and mom (played by Gisela Riquelme) to become a real-life aerialist, soaring above the audience. Even their “children” experience what it would be like to be members of this star-studded show, living what must be just about every kid’s fantasy, joining and performing in the circus.
This “pop-style” musical circus event employs exotic and domestic animals in addition to the eighty-five performers ranging from clowns to exquisite acrobatic performers; to an intellectual man of steel who catches canon balls in flight; to flying equestrian performers mounting and dismounting on the run; to motorcycle performers (the Torres family) who perform mile-a-minute death-defying madness while whirling like dervishes in a sphere of solid steel. While all of the acts were fun and entertaining, it was perhaps this final thrilling motorcycle rampage that was the most stunning of all.
I never knew that house cats could be trained to perform with exotic birds and was blown away by their performances with their Russian trainer, Svetlana Shamsheeva. The clowns were terrific with their crazy skits, ranging from gigantic food fights to midget car race mania. The only thing missing was the lions and tigers and bears, oh my! That’s right, no lions or tigers or bears!!
The show moves from Oakland to San Jose to the HP Pavilion at 525 Wes Santa Clara Street, this week, on Wednesday, August 23rd at 6 p.m. for the pre-show events and at 7:30 p.m. for the actual circus show itself. The drive to San Jose, down highway 680 is generally a relatively simple and smooth drive. This wild new circus event ends on August 27th.
While this is a great show for the entire family, it is (from my perspective) somewhat expensive and there is no price break for kids. Tickets range between $15 and $95 per person, depending on how close you want to experience the experience. By today’s standards, $15 for four hours of entertainment is not bad. I just would prefer to see prices a little more reasonable for the children. Call (510) 625-TIXS (8497) or visit www.ticketmaster.com (if you can, I strongly recommend the on-line ticket sales process) for tickets and reservations. You may also purchase tickets at the on-site box-offices but they are generally swamped.
This show is a great experience for the “Kid” in all of us and if you have grand-children, what a fun experience this could be for all!

Mormons have completed their greatest to exploit this sensibility, publishing what I personally would regard as substandard scholarship disguised as spiritual discourse.

Card Ink 17 Undrafted Free Agents - Mon. April 30, 2012 - The Cards are bringing in 17 undrafted free agents (so far). Four others (QB Jacori Harris, OG James Dekkle, DE Richetti Jones and S Eddie Elder) were either mentioned by other websites as signing with us or are expected to come in for try outs.
In reviewing the list of "the undrafted", two things leaped out: (1) many of these guys had back-stories involving brushes with the law, academic problems, leaving school, (I'm not kidding) never arriving at school or overcoming tough injuries and (2) most lacked the complete set of prototypical height-weight-speed numbers but had one or two things special about them (i.e. unreal forty-time. pass-rushing skill etc.) that could make them dominant role-players who might help the team as pass rushers, kick blockers or in the return game. The odds of an UDFA making it are pretty rough, but I think a few of these guys have a real chance of making the final roster and contributing to the success of the Cardinal football team.
3 of Final 4 Picks O-Linemen -Sat. April 28, 5:15 pm - With the remaining quality players in the 5th round flying off the board like Frisbies, the Cardinals added even more offensive line support by drafting Senio Kelemete (listed as an OT instead of an OG where most guides listed him) at #151 and then came back at #177 to select CB Justin Bethel from Presbyterian (yet another small college corner following in the steps of Greg Toler out of St. Paul). The SIRIUS braintrust (Kirwin and Brandt) seemed to like him - One of them pointed out that the difference between a #20 corner and a #4 corner is razor thin. Bethel is not a blazer (ran in the 4.5's at the Combine). At #185, Graves, Keim & Co. tabbed SD State QB Ryan Lindley. He's 6-3 229. He's supposed to be a bright guy, but I saw him in post season action, and he seemed to make a lot of mental errors. (Hopefully it was just neophyte nerves).
Kelemete represented good value and another piece of the O-line puzzle. I had him #4 on my board (after J Brown, Iloka and Carder). Bethel reflects team concern about having enough guns to match up against multi-receivers attacks. Lindley provides PS experience behind Bartell or a #3 option should a trade be in the works.
Looking at our final pick in round 7, 3 of my highest 5vplayers are all offensive linemen, and I doubt we'll draft a third one. Same is true at QB (where Foles hasn't yet gone). Dennard's 3rd on my board but we've already picked 2 corners. Looking at "non-OL's, CB's and QB's", my board looks like: Winn DT, Bryan TE, Brewster C, Matthews WR, Martineck FB, T Lewis OLB and Acho ILB (The latter 2 LB's seem like the most logical choice if they're still in play. Cards are next, so we'll get one of these dudes if the FO likes him. (Note - Shoemaker WR out of Boise hasn't been drafted yet - my sleeper of the entire draft).
With their 221st pick, the Cardinals did turn to Boise State but not to Shoemaker. They selected LT Nate Potter (who's been the protector of Kellen Moore's backside during his college career). Great value pick. I had him 4th on my board (below Brown, Reynolds and Dennard). He's more of a finesse pass blocker than a mauler, but we already have those kind of guys in Massie (& to a lesser extent) Kelemete.
Down & Dirty Recap: Cards entered the draft seeking a #2 WR opposite Fitz, additional O-line talent, a pass rusher and a run-stuffing ILB. (Although they didn't make it very public) they also wanted to shore up the secondary to match up better with multi-receiver offenses. We got our receiver (Floyd) , added a couple of cover corners and addressed the O-line situation big time with 3 picks. We didn't pick up any help on the D-line or at LB, but you can't get everything you want - the value at the 2 latter positions simply wasn't there. The only really valid issue is our drafting two corners instead of an edge-rusher and ILB, but this becomes a matter of where the value was when we picked, and the Cards decided Fleming and Bethel were more valuable to the team than other players still on the board. I also wasn't crazy about the Lindley pick at QB. (But see us in 3 years and we'll tell you how it all played out).
Redemption in 4th Round - Sat. April 28, 1 pm ET - With the 112th pick of the draft, Rod Graves, Steve Keim and Coach Wiz quieted all the doubters and naysayers (like me) - who were critical of the Cardinal FO for bypassing quality offensive linemen like Bobby Massie in Round 3 - by coming back and drafting Massey in the next round.
Massie is a mammoth offensive tackle (6-6 325) from Ole Miss. He's considered raw but with all the athletic qualities you'd love to see in an offensive tackle. He's considered a natural RT with a mean streak and black-topping run blocking ability, but you never know what Russ Grimm may have in store for him. At present, it still looks like Levi Brown will hold down the left bookend of the Cardinal offensive line, with Adam Snyder slated to stay where he does best at RG and Jeremy Bridges and others keeping the seat warm until Massie is ready to move in at RT.
As I did in the previous 3 rounds, I reset my Board and sweated out the "death watch." I started out with a Top 5 of James Brown OG Troy followed by Massie, Mosely, Crick and Iloka. All five were still available when we picked. Maybe we'll get lucky next round and come away with any of the four (we can use even more OL help) or LB's Keenan Robinson and Tank Carder at #151.
Cards' #80 a Doozie - Sat. April 28 , 9:30 am TE - I promise not to label this draft as the worst in Cardinal history until we get to hear from Coach Wiz and see how the rest of this thus-far depressing draft turns out.
With offensive linemen James Brown, Bobby Massey, Brandon Mosely Zebrie Sanders still on the board along with DE Jared Crick, LB Tank Carder, LB Keenan Robinson, DE Tyrone Crawford, CB Bill Bentley and others, the Cardinal "brain trust" decided instead to select cornerback Jamell Flemming from Oklahoma. The books have him running the forty in the mid 4.5's, red-flag and academic -fraud conviction and project him as a 4th or 5th round pick. So let's see what we have here.
BPA? (Don't think so). High Character? (Mmm...no)! Fills a Pressing Need? (Uh Uh)! Impressive on Tape? (Remains to be seen). Brings Physical Presence? (Not according to the scouting reports). So why? I'll leave a blank space below for Wiz, Rod and Steve to 'splain themselves. Meanwhile we'll have to sweat out 16 picks (from #96 to #112) with J Brown, Massey, Crick, Z Sanders and Givens Top 5 on our board.
Both Wiz and RG described Fleming as a "physical corner" Rod called him "a physical corner with speed" and "highest on our board." Rod acknowledged the need to bolster the OL "but not at the expense of passing up more talented players at other positions." He said we'll have other opportunities to address the O-line situation - if not in the draft probably by training camp. Wiz pointed out the need to respond to multi-receiver sets and special teams value. He referred to Jamell being named 2011 Fiesta Bowl MVP and his 5 interceptions 2 years ago and 2 interceptions last season. Jamal's 3-xone and shuttle performances suggest great CODS skills.
OK. I heard what Wiz and Rod had to say. There's a disconnect between their take on Fleming's physicality and what the draft books say - something to keep an eye on when we see him in Camp. Also - I'd like to get a more accurate take on the Combine results - For example,, nfl.com's website lists no forty time or 3-cone stats for Fleming but do provide footage of him running the 3-cone and caption his forty footage with a 4.53 time. So what gives? Where did Darren Urban's 4.43 forty time Combine report come from?
Bottom line - I'm still a bit underwhelmed by the pick, but Fleming is ours now and our objective should be to make him feel welcome and encourage him to do whatever it takes to prove all us nay-sayers wrong.
10:12 pm - Jamell Fleming. Who? WTF! He's so obscure we have to look him up. Turns out to be a corner from Oklahoma with an academic-fraud rap in his background projected to go in the 4th or 5th round.
10:00 pm ET - With three to go, we, we're guaranteed B Thompson, J Brown or Massey. We lose Thompson. Egnew comes off the board. And then....
9:45 pm ET - We are guaranteed to either get Thompson, Brooks, J Brown, Massey, Crick, Bentley or Z Sanders.
930 pm ET - 2 obscure WR's and a punter were drafted and strengthened our position on our board. Our floor is now Nick Toon.
9:20 pm ET - (End of Round 2) - We're guaranteed to get someone ahead of Mosely on our board. Top 5 now Thompson, Brooks, Brown, Massey and B Taylor S
8:00 pm ET - All the guys I like are quickly being peeled off my Board. My Top 5 at this early point: B Thompson DT, B Brooks OT, Reyes DT, J Brown OL, Worthy DT
Day Two (More Fun Than Day One) - Fri. Apr. 27 -11 am ET - The thing about Day One is that ithere's an overabundance of hoopla and not enough meat & potatos. There's too much time between drafts - the NFLN coverage seemed to blur into Pick followed by Commercials followed by Pick. The Day Two picks come faster, and the NFL doesn't have to waste energy trotting each of the 26 guys up to the podium. Also, this is when you can throw your mock draft into the "old news" file folder and concentrate between sessions on resetting your draft boards.
Here's what I do: After each round (including our first pick at #13) I reassess our team needs & adjust player BPA ratings and rankings accordingly to come up with a fresh #33 to #80 Board. Naturally - having taken a WR (Floyd) with our first pick, the rest of the WR's still available will tend to be downgraded somewhat, since it would be unlikely for us to draft two of them back to back.
This year, it's kind of depressing - having traded our 2nd round pick to Philly in the Kolb deal - we have to go 66 spots until we get to pick again (despite still having urgent holes to fill at OT, pass-rusher and ILB). And a hidden indirect fall-out of not having a 2nd round pick is that it robbed us of ammunition to trade up and the leverage to trade down.
Looking forward to tonight, we have to hope we can fill a position need with a quality player. The good news about waiting for 66 spots top go by is that it increases the chances that a few more highly-rated players will slip thru the cracks down to us at #80.
In terms of BPA - Glenn, Upshaw, Hill and Kendrick sit highest on our new Board. Position-wise, available players include:
Draft Day Finally Here - Fri. Apr. 27, 2012 - 10 am ET - (based on notes after the fact) The draft continues to feel a little bit weird - first of all , I'm still not used to the NFL breaking it up into three separate days. Secondly, it was the first time I'd be able to separate myself from my downstairs office PC and watch the draft in our living room accompanied by my trusty new I-Pad. (Sure makes things easier).
I anticipated the Draft with more questions than answers. My two areas of focus were, of course, (1) how the Cardinals would do and (2) how actual results would match my mock draft projections.
The way things were breaking, I saw the Cardinals in play to draft Ingram, DeCastro, Reiff or Floyd (with Keuchly an outside shot). I felt they were close enough together to allow "need" to be a bigger factor and that we needed an elite pass rusher or offensive lineman more than we did a receiver (There'd be plenty of those guys around later in the draft).
I still held out hope that - if there were 4 or 5 guys we liked still on our Board at #13, we'd be able to trade down to regain at least part of our lost 2nd round pick (traded away in the Kolb deal). Without that extra pick, we'd be out-of-play until Pick #80 (where pickings would be extremely slim). If we stood pat, the depressing part would be that we'd only be able to effectively address one of our 3 or 4 position needs.
6. If you're the Rams - Blackmon or Claiborne? (Neither. They traded down with Dallas and took Brockers)
12. Is Kirkpatrick considered so tarnished that he'll slip past #20? (Uh uh - he went to Cincy at #17)
13. What's up with the Lions. I have no clue about their intentions (Reiff fell to them like a gift from heaven. Good job)
14. Hightower's a lock to go to Pittsburgh or Baltimore, right? (Wrong! New England moved up to get him).
16. How high will Chandler Jones leap up to? As high as #9 where Mayock rates him? (No. Fair value at #21)
17. Is the rumor accurate that NE likes C Jones enough to trade up for him? (Yes. NE moved up 6 spots to get him).
18. McClellan to Green Bay - real or imagined? (We'll never know - the Bears grabbed him 9 spots earlier).
20. Fleener to the Giants? (The Giants opted for the 3rd RB - Wilson - to be selected in the first round. Fleener not drafted yet).
21. Zeitler or Fleener to the Niners? (No, the surprised the heck out of me by reaching for Jenkins with Hill still on the board).
St. Louis passing on a needed receiver (Blackmon or Floyd) and the best CB in the draft to trade down and grab Brockers.

And after spending the day with Geoff and Kelly, I would describe their love as sweet. They are very fond of one another. But there is more to it then just that. They value one another. Geoff really cared how Kelly felt on her wedding day. He didn't approach this as "Hey, I'm the groom! Just show up and put on my tux!" He went out of his way to make her day special; to tell her things privately and publicly that expressed his heart for her.
After getting primped, polished and perfect the ladies perched and mingled in the limo while Kelly read a multi-page-hand-written-letter waiting for her from Geoff. She also opened a gift from him.
In the dearness of those happy moments, no one noticed the first few raindrops. Or the second few.But somewhere between leaving the hotel and arriving at the church we were in the middle of hurricane-like rain.
The following images are exactly the benefits of working with a second-shooter. Because, you see, while my second shooter was taking these:
After the very elegant and beautiful ceremony, we enjoyed each others company in the church courtyard. I may not have been the girls favorite human by making them walk through wet grass and drizzly air.But it was worth it, hey ladies?
Before long, and certainly not long enough for this thrilled photographer, we were moments away from the reception. I had to almost be pulled away from the portrait session with this couples. If only I had known what was in store ;)
Kelly told me at our first client meeting that Geoff had always wanted a winter wedding. They decided to meet in the middle and do a preppy, glamorous, winter-in-summer wedding. That is a first for me ;) Kelly put in hours of etsy-ing, creating, crafting, meeting with vendors and dreaming of the reception at The George Washington Hotel. It was incredible. Make sure you take note of her hand-made (bead by bead!) table numbers!
The guests were thrilled, I was ending my day on a buzz, Geoff and Kelly were as happy as ever.What a wonderful world.
ps. check out their amazing wedding video done by my friends over at ClubHill Media! They are wow-impressive.

Inspired by the Iron Druid Chronicles™ series by Kevin Hearne and Thor's Hammer pendants worn by the Viking people, the Badali Jewelry artist, J. Ryan Cazier, designed and created Leif Helgarson's™ Thor's Hammer. Each Thor's Hammer necklace is skillfully crafted in your choice of sterling silver, antiqued sterling silver, yellow bronze, antiqued bronze, or dark bronze. Antiqued silver, antiqued bronze and dark bronze are surface treatments that will eventually wear away over time. How quickly a surface treatment will wear away is dependent on the daily wear and tear the item will be exposed to. The Thors Hammer pendants are carefully hand finished and individually inspected for the highest quality by our staff. Leif's Thor's Hammer is an officially licensed Iron Druid Chronicles replica with Kevin Hearne. Mr. Hearne personally approves each piece of jewelry from our jewelry line.
Atticus's lawyer, Leif Helgarson, is a charming, old fashioned, and extremely powerful Vampire from the Iron Druid Chronicles series. Before becoming a vampire, Leif was a Viking colonist in Iceland during the 10th century. Like most Vikings, he worshiped Thor, the Norse Thunder God, and wore a Thor's Hammer pendant to show his dedication to the God. Mjolnir, Thor's Hammer, is commonly thought to mean "That which smashes". Wearing Thor's Hammer is an expression of strength and determination. Thor punished Leif by killing his family when Leif unknowingly confesses his desire to become a vampire to the God in disguise as a stranger in a tavern. Leif wears his Thor's Hammer necklace throughout the centuries as a symbol of his planned vengeance against Thor.
Leif's Thor's Hammer pendant measures approximately 29.1 mm (just over 1 1/8") long, 24.6 mm (just under 1") at the widest point of the hammer, and 7 mm (just over 1/4") thick. Leif's necklace weighs approximately 11.7 grams in sterling silver, approximately 9.6 grams in bronze. The back of the pendant is partially carved out, stamped with our makers mark, and copyright symbol. The sterling silver pendant is also stamped with the metal content, STER (sterling), ensuring our jewelry is made of the finest metals.
We are a cast-to-order company and cast every Tuesday and Thursday. Please allow 5 to 7 days from the next casting date for production of this item. Orders placed before 3pm MST Monday or Wednesday will be included in the following day's cast. Feel free to contact us for the anticipated production time for your Iron Druid Chronicles Jewelry.

Then, as you step through the floor to ceiling sliding glass walls, you find yourself in outdoor living rooms that are an extension of the indoors, their cool white walls, funky furniture and sense of airy openness creating a continuation of interiors.
Outside, a swimming pool is a Mediterranean oasis, luring you with its siren long of sweet relief from the heat of the day. This clean, contemporary style setting is cool in every sense of the word, from its minimalist adornments to the crisp white architecture of the houses themselves.

Buy your Jigsaw from us at Randburg Midas then learn how to use it like a pro! We have the perfect power tools to help you tackle and master any DIY project! In our opinion, the jigsaw ranks a close second to the cordless drill as must have do-it-yourself power tools. They are very versatile and work perfectly for around the house fixes and small woodworking projects. Even if you’ve never used a saw before the jigsaw is extremely intuitive and also safer to operate than most power saws. Children can also be taught how to use a jigsaw and can be one of the first power tools they learn to use. But as with any power tool they should be respected and handled with care as well and proper safety equipment should be used when operating them. Jigsaws are perfect for cutting pine boards and plywood both of which will be used extensively in many of the DIY projects we are going to post. You can also buy saw blades that will cut laminate, tile and metal. Before using your jigsaw make sure you have the correct blade and your workspace is clear of any obstructions. You’ll also want to consider using gloves and we highly recommend wearing safety goggles to protect your eyes from sawdust. When you start your cut make sure the shoe of the saw which is the flat guide is firmly placed on the cutting material and start the blade before moving it into the wood. Mark out your cuts beforehand and keep your fingers far away from the blade. Also be aware of what is below your cutting material so it doesn’t get snagged by the blade such as a cord, table or pant leg. With more experience, you’ll get the hang of using your jigsaw and learn how to cut corners (literally) and make smooth cuts around edges For more information: Call or WhatsApp (082) 882-6324 | (011) 789-4411 / (011) 036-0200 | marco@midasrandburg.co.za | 191 Bram Fischer Drive, Randburg.

Are you sick and tired of expensive damages caused by potholes? If you answered yes, you have got to read this article on how to claim for pothole damage to your car! Yes you read that correctly. You can actually claim damages caused by potholes! if they meet certain requirements, of course. Motorists have become accustomed to the rigours of replacing tyres due to potholes but there is a way to circumvent the cost of new tyres. Not only are your tyres being damaged, but your vehicle’s rims can too, which leads to a whole host of other problems. Les McMaster, chairperson of the Motor Industry Workshop Association (MIWA), says rim damage can often lead to vehicle alignment and suspension problems. Craig Courtney-Leaver, CEO of alloy rim repair specialists, Wheel Collision, said, “If one feels a vibration in the steering wheel, the chances are one of the front rims are damaged and if one feels the vibration on the seat, then it is usually a rear rim.” So, what happens when you have replaced a burst or damaged tyre? Johannesburg Roads Agency (JRA) spokesperson Bertha Peters-Scheepers said, “The public may lodge a claim with the JRA’s Legal Department for alleged damages suffered due to road and/or infrastructure (such as manhole or kerb inlet) that the JRA as a municipal-owned entity of the City of Johannesburg is mandated to maintain.” There are a couple of procedures that have to be followed in order to claim. In addition to completing the claim form, attach the following documents: Police affidavit Copy of driver’s license of the claimant (in case of vehicle damage) Vehicle registration documents (in case of vehicle damage) Copy of ID Photos of the damage to the car (in case of vehicle damage) Three quotations or invoice/proof of payment Letter from insurance company confirming that the claim was not logged to own insurance Doctor’s report if there is personal injury JRA recommends that you either email or fax the documents. Doing both only delays the process. Peters-Scheepers added, “It is important [for readers to be aware] that the claims process does take time as we work with both our insurance brokers and insurers in the processing of claims.” Each claim is assessed on its merits and in accordance with our public liability policy which means not all claims will be successfully paid out. For additional information please contact JRA directly on: hotline@jra.org.za or 086 056 2874….
We post daily on some of the most useful and interesting topics that are trending in the world including:
"Search engines cannot index pages with Flash and using Flash in your page will lower it's ranking."
Anyone who's read some of my other writings on Flash might be wondering why I have included the above opinion as a myth. You're right, I'm not a big fan of Flash but, as with many things, there is a time and a place ...
The last point first - including Flash will not lower the rank of a page or a site. It may not help it but it can't lower it. That would be like saying including images on your page will lower the rank. It could be argued that the inclusion of a Flash script could dilute the keyword density, but the counter to that is if Flash is loaded correctly this can be minimised. Besides, if this can throw it off it couldn't have been very good before.
Where Flash is a problem is relying on it for navigation or for a complete site. Search engines don't understand the graphic content of a Flash file but some, Google in particular, are making great efforts to extract the text content in Flash files. Any text extracted will be indexed. The problem is portions of the text extracted can be seen out of context and will not flow like a standard page, and the jury is still out on the issue of following links to other pages on the site.
The big mistake when using Flash is to limit the alternate text (for when Flash is unavailable) to a link to download Flash. Think about it, the majority of people who want to or are able to use Flash probably already have it loaded. By all means provide a method of downloading or upgrading Flash, if required, but make sure you also provide some content that is relevant to the purpose of the site and some contact information for the search engines and other visitors without Flash.
Stay focused on delivering the right message to your audience. Anything that distracts or annoys them while visiting your site is harmful. A mini movie complete with soundtrack does more to demonstrate the skills of the designer than inform your audience about your product or service.
You can quibble about the exact percentage, but our experience suggests Google is far and away the most dominant Search Engine in operation at present, so let's assume 80% is about right. Even so, the only time this advice is good is if you only have a limited opportunity to promote your site. If that's the case, of course your effort should be with Google. Put your effort where it will do the most good.
Back in the world in which I live, I can't afford to ignore 20% of the potential market. Besides, most of the Search Engines follow many of the same basic rules, so success in one often translates to success in the others, and how hard is it to submit your site to Yahoo and NineMSN? In my opinion - not very! So why wouldn't you try to get some recognition in the other engines? If you have these 3 engines working for you, you may have more like 95% of the Search Engine market covered.
Ignoring the other Search Engines is a bit like not making some effort to ensure your website meets the minimum Accessibility Standards. Ignoring every 5th potential customer is short sighted (no pun intended) to say the least.
As usually we are happy to discuss the issues raised in this discussion. You can contact us by visiting MidBoh contact page.

There is nothing worse than shopping online, finding a thumbnail size image of the product that just may be what you need and it has a caption "Click to Enlarge", and when you click it you see the same thumbnail-size image.
This sort of "helpfulness" will turn away a shopper in the blink of an eye. While you're at it make sure when you show the image you give the visitor some options - like how to get back to where they can buy the product. You've done all the hard work. It's now time to make the sale.

Shiratori Ryuushi is a young artist-in-training, about to start studying at a vocational school. Arriving at his new lodgings, Narutakisou, he finds himself the focus of attention for the collection of weirdos that inhabit the place. He also meets and falls for the landlady, Aoba Kozue, who seems to be both lovely and charming. However, Kozue is not what she seems to be... in fact, shes more. (Source: ANN)
"This could be big," he said after I told him about the company who wants me to cover their 100+ employees. I pay him to give me the stark reality of things, but his optimism made me uncomfortable. "You've got to go for this. I know you don't feel ready for it yet, but this could really be huge for your business, and I don't think you should pass this up."
I sighed. Yes, this is a victory of sorts (still only theory, not reality), but what if I can't deliver? What if I fail?
"You know," a colleague told me during another phone conversation, "You are the buzz of the medical community right now. We talked about you for half an hour at lunch today ... and it was all good!" He went on to use phrases like "our only hope," and "the way out," to describe the potential for my practice model.
"No," I thought, "I am not Obi-Wan. I'm not your only hope." I sighed. I don't want that kind of pressure on me before I even see my first patient. What if I fail?
One of the main things that separates good clinicians from the rest is the ability to think through contingencies. When I order a test or prescribe a treatment I have to consider the possible outcomes: if the test shows X, then we do Y; if it shows not-X, then we do Z. Or, here's the plan if you get better on the medication, and here's the plan if you don't. The more contingencies I can anticipate and plan for, the more direct the path to the ultimate destination: resolution (or management) of the problem. I find that my experience in thinking through contingencies serves me well in my current job of building a new and innovative practice.
Obviously, if I fail to get enough patients to support the business, things could get really tough. I have bills to pay and the evil overlords of college tuition to placate. The fear of this failure has driven me to spend a large part of most days over the past two months working. I don't want to fail and I will bust my butt to prevent that outcome. The question is not simply, "Can I succeed?" I must also consider the possible consequences of success, and plan how to deal with them. When I consider those consequences it quickly becomes clear how scary they could be.
This is the easiest danger caused by success to anticipate. When I open the practice, I may be met with an overwhelming number of people wanting to sign up. If I open the doors too wide and too many patients become my patients at once, I could have trouble keeping up with demands.
It's like a restaurant that opens up to a flood of patrons before it is ready to handle the volume. The result is poorer quality food and longer waits, which could doom the ultimate success of the business. This is one of the reasons I was nervous when I was contacted by the business about becoming their "company doctor." I don't want to put out a poor quality product.
The solution for this is to open the practice slowly, or have a "soft opening." As much as my former patients are banging on my doors to open up, I may be tempted to let people in before I am able to give care that is worthy of their trust.
I had the husband of a patient pay me an off-handed compliment after hearing my presentation about my new practice: "So when you become real successful in this, how long will it be until you don't have time to see patients anymore?" I appreciated use of the word "when" rather than "if" in his question. He not only saw the merit in the idea of what I was doing, he saw the potential for building a big business on this idea.
My answer was simple (and perhaps somewhat over-confident): "Never," I said. "I am leaving my old job so I can do what I love: see patients. I am not going to allow this business to take me away from the very reason I started it."
Others have suggested starting a franchise, writing books, or making money as a consultant for practices who want to follow my path. I hate this, not only because I haven't seen a single patient or gotten a single check (and thus have the practice equivalent of vapor-ware), but because I see this as a real possibility.
The solution to this will largely depend on the people who I end up working with. If I hire well (which is not an easy thing by any stretch), then I can delegate to people worthy of those tasks. But I am not a micro-manager (unlike most docs), so my temptation will be to get lazy and put too much in the hands of people who haven't shown they deserve that trust.
Let's say I dodge consequences 1 and 2, have a thriving practice and a bunch of money coming from consulting and from my show on Oprah's TV network (giving Dr. Oz the heave-ho in the process). It's a roaring success, the money is coming in, and doctors are leaving traditional practices in droves to emulate my incredible business model. I've been able to dump the administrative tasks to others, leaving me to see patients and scoff at the pittance demanded by the tuition gods. That would be a dream come true, wouldn't it?
Not necessarily. One of the most common criticisms I hear for what I am doing (and one I often bring up to myself) is that it is not generalizable to the whole of health care. I am cutting back my patient load from approximately 4,000 patients (the number I carried in my old practices) to 1,000. That is one of the keys to this type of practice: keep patient volume down so patients get more time.
So what happens if this business model takes off and a significant percentage of primary care doctors "abandon" 75% of their patients? It turns a shortage of primary care providers into a crisis. It turns direct care practices into a real threat to the viability of the entire system.
It would create a huge backlash. Direct care would have enemies, and those enemies could do things like requiring doctors to accept Medicare and/or Medicaid to have a license to practice. I've heard it suggested already, and it terrifies me.
This is one of the main reasons I've become increasingly focused on a new goal: to grow my practice back to the same size it was in the old system. I would have to do so using my "organic medical home," hiring dietitians, home visiting nurses, social workers, counselors, and other professionals to manage aspects of my patients' care, allowing me to increase my overall panel size (and perhaps even lowering my monthly fees).
If primary care physicians can have a profitable business without selling their souls, if patients can be given more access to care, better care, and save money, and if all of this can be done without threatening to destroy the system itself, perhaps some specialists will become envious and come back to "real medicine."

Time to take a little break from the South Georgia images and come back to the good old USA. I made this image in the Grand Tetons last summer and it sat largely ignored. There are two things I wanted to highlight, first the texture of the Bison and second the shapes in the trees in the background. Converting to black & white with Silver Efex Pro seemed the best way to go and with control points, getting all the tonality in various parts of the images where I wanted it was a snap.
Lance Hankins posted on Saturday about more readable classpaths using the <propertyregex> task. It jogged my memory back about 4 years when I was trying to solve the same problem. This was back in the days of Ant 1.4.1 and just before the existence of the optional Ant-Contrib package. Back then I was considered a bit of an Ant Meister by my colleagues as I managed to spend hours tweaking the smallest of things in my lovingly created Ant build environment searching for perfection...
So how did I solve this particular issue? A clue is in the title of this post, I used the <pathconvert> task, which is normally used to convert lists of files, directories, etc. and convert them to a different platform's style. So path separators using Windows ';' get converted to Unix ':', etc. But you can also use it to convert the path separators to something else, in my case a nicely formatted string for displaying in a printable form.
The original classpath is referenced in 'path.classpath.compile', and the newly formatted classpath is saved in 'echo.path.compile'. The magic is the pathsep statement. This says that the path separator (the ';' or ':') is to be replaced with a new line (CR or CRLF depending on operating system) followed by some characters that make the listing look nice.
Remke, That is a very nice clean solution, I've not used the macrodef stuff yet, is that available in Ant 1.6?
Thank you all very much for your recent thanks, it's nice to know that one of my older posts is still useful!

To distinguish, as I believe I have done to some extent before, a metaphysical ratio in free psyche (never mind bound soma) of least heaven and most god from less (in relation to least) heaven and more (in relation to most) god, and this in turn from more (in relation to most) heaven and less (in relation to least) god, and most heaven and least god, as one might distinguish, from our point of view, metaphysics in the cosmos from metaphysics in nature, and that in turn from metaphysics in mankind and metaphysics in cyborgkind (to slightly anticipate the future), or, more specifically, planets like Saturn (cosmos) from winged seedpods (nature), and this in turn from prayer and/or meditation (mankind) and substance entitlement (cyborgkind), the latter of which, corresponding to most heaven and least god, would be the definitive manifestation of metaphysics and therefore the most internalized stage of all.
But although I have said pretty much the same thing before, also allowing for man, in general terms, to approach cosmic metaphysics smokingly and natural metaphysics sexually, I did not distinguish, as I can now, between the heavenly and godly aspects of metaphysical free psyche in terms of the inner experience of Heaven and that experience perceived (by us) from the outside, which is effectively where the concept of God, or godliness, comes into play, since that is no more and no less than a superficial, or external, take on Heaven, not a separate entity that stands apart from Heaven like some kind of person.
Between the Soul and its superconscious self-realization there is no distinction, even though a distinction indubitably exists between the basis of the Soul in the brain stem and spinal cord of the central nervous system and the experiencing, all-too-sentient soul itself, which is superconscious and never more so, I shall contend, than when self-absorbed rather than distracted, via the senses, by external phenomena and even noumena, as in the case, for example, of the stars.
There is also a distinction, touched upon in an earlier entry, between this superconscious and what I have termed superego, which owes more to the brain – and possibly even to the brain stem as that part of the brain closest to the spinal cord – on an intellectually-bovaryized basis than ever it does to the Soul, since it is used to understand metaphysics and to be pro-metaphysical even as it necessarily falls short of metaphysics-proper, in which the Soul’s superconscious experience of itself precludes thought, being pertinent to the ‘peace that suprasses all understanding’.
One should also note, in dropping from metaphysics to physics, that between the Ego and its conscious self-realization there is no appreciable distinction either, even though one indubitably exists between the basis of the Ego in the brain and the thoughts of the Ego itself, which is conscious, and never more so, I shall argue, than when self-absorbed rather than distracted by externals, most of which will register as phenomena rather than as noumena to a person centred in the Ego and therefore more disposed to what could be called a corporeal view of life.
Thus no less than feelings are germane to superconsciousness, so thoughts are germane to consciousness, both of which tend, barring bovaryized thoughts (pro-spiritual superego) and bovaryized feelings (pro-intellectual subsoul) to be mutually exclusive, since effectively appertaining to the sensibilities, noumenal and phenomenal, metaphysical and physical, of contrary axes, with correspondingly disparate ethnic implications.
Ego and soul do not inhabit the same person, but only either ego and bovaryized soul (pro-intellectual subsoul) on the one hand, or soul and bovaryized ego (pro-spiritual superego) on the other hand, the former centred in knowledge (with a correlative manifestation of pleasure) and the latter in truth or, rather joy (with a correlative manifestation of truth), so that the disitinction is rather akin to economics and religion, form and contentment, a humanistic world and a transcendental otherworld, neither of which are – or ever could be – compatible.

Im a high school senior and need 15 community service hours by jan 3rd or i wont graduate, i live in queens, forest hills to be more specific, and i stilll dont know where to volunteer, ive been googling like crazy and calling dozens of places asking them if i can volunteer and their all full for the next month or something im so stressed plz help me find somewhere in nyc that i can start volunteering immediately preferably in queens, ny
Very detailed information that discusses your many, many options – the usual and many activities you probably never thought of. Includes instructions on how to find specific volunteering opportunities (with animals, with children, just for one day, volunteer vacations, etc.).
I am making an independent movie and want to scout some forests for some locations. Ideally the forest should be as untouched as possible. Does anyone have any ideas that I should think about?
How do you travel from Linden Blvd to the Queens Center Mall by train? and by bus? Also, how do you travel to the mall from Jamaica Ave? The closest train to me is the J train and the bus is Q4.
My friend, take the Q4 bus to the Jamaica Center subway station, and transfer there to the Manhattan-bound (westbound) “E” express train (Blue Line on the subway map).
Take the “E” train from Jamaica Center to Forest Hills/71st-Continental. Transfer there to the either the “G”, “R” or “V” local trains (Light Green, Yellow or Orange Lines).
Take either the “G”, “R” or “V” local trains from Forest Hills/71st-Continental to Woodhaven Blvd-Slattery Plaza/Queens Center Mall. When you exit the subway at Woodhaven Blvd, its a short walking distance to the mall.
this is the address. i live in Forest hills, 11375. i heard i have to take the E train to Queens plaza, then..?
The planner gives the option of E or G. From the look of the map, Queens Plaza is only about 500 feet from the school. You can use the MTA’s trip planner to create a custom trip from & to whatever address you want.
i live in forest hills, queens, NY. does anyone know somewhere nearby that offers camera repair? do malls offer those?
Most of the time a camera store will actually mail it to a repair center for you. Unless you have a very good camera, most likely the cost of the repair is going to exceed the cost of getting a new camera.
i’m thinking of moving to queens this summer and was just wondering what areas in queens are safe and is convenient when traveling to the city for work. i’m possibly taking classes in queens college to further my career so a town in between queens and nyc would be convenient
Someone beat me already- Forest Hills- Like 20 mins by subway and 10 minutes on the LIRR. Before i moved to Brooklyn, my co worker that lived in Forest Hill tried soo hard to get me to move there.. She loves it. It’s a bit suburban for my taste, but it is very safe and convienent to the city. It is costly though so I don’t know your budget.
It really depends on what area in Manhattan. If you are in the middle of Times Square then there is really no comparison. It has alot of tourism. The Upper East Side is more affluent and less busy. Some parts of Brooklyn are just 1 or two stops away from lower Manhattan (ie. Brooklyn Heights, Dumbo). These places are very affluent. Brooklyn Heights has many rowhouses and is historic (clean streets). Queens ie. Forest Hills is very nice, lots of shopping, lounges and restaurants along Queens Boulevard and Austin Street. It’s like it’s own little city. Forest Hills has a train station and subway stops directly to Penn Station around 15 minutes away. NYC is it’s own entity. I feel that it is hard to compare to any other real estate markets in the country. While other markets are declining Manhattan keeps on increasing due to to the high demand a limited supply. Condo’s are around 1k+ per square foot. While outside Manhattan could be anywhere between 500-850 per square foot. The truth is in the numbers.
At the time of marriage, two unique folks are joined along. Two personalities increase a confident character being a few. This is 1 good reason how come unique wedding ceremony rings help to make a significant part with the couple’s life. In fact , wedding groups symbolize a never ending love but as marriages can easily last for a long time, this must also be a good reminder that love has to be distinct and truly growing making it carry on.
A further lady who exuded stateliness was obviously a you are not selected in your ministry. Her hair was at all times done to efficiency with this gorgeous gray beehive. She walked and talked with eloquence only seen in movie channels. She held herself in a way that talked volumes of her activities and depth of character. If she could hear this explanation of the girl’s she would probably blush by means of embarrassment and say I was greater little off my rocker! The woman’s name is Bea.
The vast majority of couples choose the bouquets because of their marriage ceremony in line with most of the meanings. You may be unfamiliar the fact that roses represent love. Friendship and being loyal is usually symbolized by blue hydrangeas. On the other hand, lilacs and daisies correspond to innocence. If you want wonder increasingly being any statement of the special occasion, orchids operate best collection of flora. The magnificence of your respective day will likely not sole be contingent on that marriage wedding dress or suit that you’re going to wear. Wedding flowers will be widely-used to be able to highlight the greatest thing about the full affair.

Head Control has brought a poor rap at various points — it is usually considered “evil” due to the alternatively shady nature. What I need you to appreciate is it can be possibly not wrong to employ intellect control on women – provided the intentions are perfect. Needless to say, using Mind Control to help you “force” women to love choosing wrong. I would ask you ought to sole use it for great.
When ever most of the wedding ceremony festivities have also been feeling relaxed, maybe it’s your gracious gesture for you to write some letter inside your parents. Of course it’s possible you have currently thanked them face-to-face designed for everything they did, nevertheless think about just how surprised and touched that they had be to get your letter, revealing to your thinking and conveying your appreciation as of this vital stage you’ve got ever had.

Given its prolific presence at CES, (augmented reality) AR tech is likely to become everyone’s shiny new toy this year. Just think about it, with AR technology, consumers have immersive experiences available right at their fingertips. A popular AR contender was the Vuzix Blade, which is a pair of Android-powered sunglasses that deliver notifications and even Alexa functionality right to your eyes via a color display. Other notable mentions include the Lenovo Mirage Solo and Arsenz Thermoglass with FLIR.
At CES last year, connected household devices were popular, but now they’re so prevalent that they’ll soon redefine the modern home entirely. There were smart doorbells that allow users to answer their door even if they’re not at home, a connected thermostat that learns the behavior of homeowners, and even a voice-lighted mirror with Amazon Alexa embedded into it. In fact, Samsung said it will increase its own smart home offerings, pledging that all of its devices from TVs to washing machines will be “smart” by 2020.
At McAfee, we understand that IoT devices continue to permeate the modern home. That’s why we’ve created McAfee Secure Home Platform as the answer to the IoT boom. At this year’s CES, we even took over the Public House Restaurant in the Venetian and simulated a smart home experience to showcase how exactly McAfee Secure Home Platform works. We also continued our mission of protecting the connected home by working with D-Link on the new AC2600 Wi-Fi Router Powered by McAfee.
We continued the theme of extending protection beyond the PC or mobile phone by partnering with Samsung on Samsung Secure Wi-Fi, with back-end technology from McAfee to encrypts personal information during sensitive transaction and online activities.
And last but not least, we moved into a new space with the launch of McAfee Identity Theft Protection, designed to provide exactly that. This solution allows users to take a proactive approach to protecting their identities with personal and financial monitoring and recovery tools to help keep their identities personal and secure.
All in all, CES 2018 proved that innovation isn’t slowing down, and that also goes for connected devices and the technology that protects them. Both IoT devices and cybersecurity landscape are adapting to the needs of everyday consumers to make sure everyone can enjoy their digital life in a safe way.

Intrinsic is in the midst of what it has dubbed the "largest and most comprehensive study ever performed to investigate the effects of discectomy in the lumbar spine." In August 2013, it reported enrolling the 400th patient in this trial with centers in the EU. It is comparing the rate of disc reherniations and improved function for high risk patients for Intrinsic's Barricaid device compared to limited discectomy alone.
The startup received a CE mark in 2009 for Barricaid. The device is designed to treat large anular ruptures; patients with large ruptures have a higher chance of disc reherniations. About one-quarter of patients with large anular ruptures relapse after a traditional discectomy, but in a study the company said it had a relapse rate of only 1.5% for patients with an annulus defect of more than 6 mm.
A standard discectomy leaves an opening in the outer structure of the disc at the end of surgery. The Barricaid is formed of flexible mesh that mimics the structure of a healthy anulus, which is formed from layers of counterangled collagen fibers. The anulus is the outer fibrous layers of the intervertebral disc.
According to the SEC filing, more than 28 investors have already participated in the current financing round. Its prior financing was in 2012 for $12 million, according to SEC filings.
Intrinsic was founded in 2000. Its founder, Greg Lambrecht, was previously VP of product development and marketing at orthopedic implant giant Stryker. He came up with the idea for the Barricaid after his own mother had to endure a second discectomy to remove a disc after the initial surgery proved ineffective.

The first volume of Brothers Conflict delivers the shocking “first conflict”, the suspicious sight of the brothers, an exciting summer vacation along with a heart-throbbing night, and how the brothers take care of Ema when she caught a cold.
On May 22, Hinata Ema is moving to Sunrise Residence, an elite apartment located in Kichijouji, Tokyo. Her mother passed away soon after giving birth to her, and her father, Hinata Rintarou, is a famous adventurer. Rintarou is going to remarry with a well-known apparel maker named Asahina Miwa, so starting from today Ema will live with Miwa’s children — her new brothers. In front of the apartment building, a young boy nearly runs her over with his bike. Soon his big brother comes to apologize, and Ema thinks about how nice it would be to have siblings. Little did she know that both of them are two of her new brothers.
When Ema goes to greet her new brothers, the one who opens the door for her is Ukyou (2nd son, lawyer), and Kaname (3rd son, Buddhist monk) instantly hits on her. The boy from earlier is Wataru (youngest son, 5th grader), and the man who apologized to her is Masaomi (oldest son, pediatrician). Soon Tsubaki (5th son, seiyuu) comes and sticks to Ema — instantly trying to satisfy his 妹萌え[1] — but luckily Azusa (6th son, also a seiyuu) stops him from harassing their new sister. Tsubaki and Azusa are identical twins, though they have completely different personalities. Ema also meets Iori (10th son, 3rd year high school student), Subaru (9th son, university student), and lastly Yusuke (11th son, 2nd year high school student) — the last one being Ema’s classmate at school. They almost have a fight because Yusuke keeps saying he won’t accept Ema as a sister, but Masaomi calms them down by stuffing candies straight into their mouths. xD The day ends with Tsubaki repeatedly asking Ema to call him “onii-chan”, and she thinks about how it would be an unforgettable day for the rest of her life LOL.
The next day, Ema finds Kaname and Subaru in the living room — resting after their morning road walk. Just like the day before, Subaru is really quiet and won't even greet her properly, so Ema wonders if she did something that made him angry. Ema goes to help Ukyou cooking breakfast for everyone after that, and that’s when Louis(8th son, hairdresser) suddenly appears out of the blue to touch her hair. He tells her that she’s good at arranging her hair, and he also promises to give her a nice hair treatment next time. During breakfast, the TV shows a famous idol named Asakura Fuuto, and the brothers start talking as if they know him. Ukyou starts thinking about what kind of souvenir they should ask Fuuto to bring home next, Tsubaki and Azusa are saying that he’s not good at singing, while Wataru points out that he’s good in dancing. Iori notices that Ema seems confused, and so he explains that Fuuto (12th son, junior high student and idol) is their brother too. “Asakura” is his stage name, and he’s often away from home because of his busy schedule!
On June 22, exactly one month after Ema started living with the brothers, the shower in Ema’s room is broken and she goes to take a bath on the 5th floor instead.
Ema finds Tsubaki and Azusa talking in the living room. They say suspicious things which are hinting about a forbidden relationship between siblings, and this causes Ema to get the wrong idea about their relationship. (○´ﾟωﾟ｀):;*.’:;ﾌﾞｯ Afraid that she might disturb them, Ema decides to leave the 5th floor for now.
Upon returning to the 5th floor, Ema notices that someone is sleeping on the sofa. After taking a closer look, she realizes that it’s actually Fuuto. She’s surprised since it’s the first time she ever saw an idol directly, but then suddenly he wakes up and treats her like an intruder. Even after Ema explains who she is, Fuuto replies by saying she’s so stupid for approaching a guy when he’s sleeping. Fuuto also calls her “stupid big sister”, and Ema leaves the living room in anger. The smiling image of “Asakura Fuuto” in her mind has been destroyed into pieces.
No one’s around so early in the morning, so Ema finally takes a bath on the 5th floor and walks out of the bathroom only wearing a towel — ignoring Juli’s (her squirrel) warning. Just as Juli fears, Ema then runs into Subaru — who’s only wearing his underwear — in the kitchen LOL. It appears that Subaru always walks around in his underwear after training, and today is no exception.. except he forgot that Ema is now living with them. (* ´艸`)ｸｽｯ♪ Subaru turns deep red and only stares at Ema until Juli eventually rages, so she runs away and takes Juli out of the living room before anything happens. xD
During breakfast, Louis suddenly glances at Juli and asks if he’s not talking today.. which really confuses Ema because nobody other than her can hear Juli’s voice. For other people, he only squeaks like a normal squirrel whenever he’s talking. Things are still awkward for Subaru and Ema, so he eats his breakfast really fast and leaves as soon as he’s done — clearly avoiding her. Since Tsubaki and Azusa are still being ラブラブ[2] this morning, Ema bluntly asks about their relationship. ﾌﾟｯ(※థэథ)∵.*.∵ Tsubaki jokingly answers they’re dating, but eventually they explain that they were only practicing last night. Tsubaki will be voicing a drama CD about a forbidden relationship, and Azusa was helping him by acting out the younger sister’s role. xD
Ever since she moved to Sunrise Residence, Ema has to take the train to school. The train is always packed in the morning, so the brothers tell Yusuke to walk to school with her already. Even though they’re living together now, they never actually go to school together. He even told her not to call his name at school, because people will be suspicious if she suddenly calls him “Yusuke-kun” instead of the usual “Asahina-kun”.. but eventually Yusuke agrees to walk to school together. The train is packed as usual, but Yusuke protects Ema from the morning crowd. They’re standing really close to each other since the train is full, and he’s blushing the whole time. (๑´ლ`๑)♡ Ema thanks him when they finally get off, and Yusuke runs off to class while still blushing.
In July, everyone goes to Miwa’s private island for summer vacation. Ema wears a bikini to the beach, which causes Subaru to go Σ(〃д〃)[3] upon seeing her.. then he gives her his parker and tells her to wear it. Kaname, on the other hand, wants to see some skin and tries to take off the parker instead. 8D When Wataru asks why he’s trying to strip Ema, Kaname answers that he’ll wait until the kids go to sleep at night — upsetting Wataru for being treated as a kid. On the beach, Rui builds a sand miniature of Taj Mahal until he eventually faints on top of Ema. It turns out he can’t stand the heat, and he always faints whenever they visit the beach every year. xD While Tsubaki and Azusa are helping Ema to carry Rui away from the beach, Yusuke and Subaru are having a swimming race in the sea, and Iori is studying with Fuuto near their cottage. When Ema comes to approach them, Fuuto says they’re both busy with a lot of stuff — unlike a certain flat-chested, stupid girl. Of course he’s referring to Ema, and she instantly rages even though she does admit that her chest is flat. ﾌﾟｯ(※థэథ)∵.*.∵ Iori quickly stops Fuuto from insulting Ema any further, but since Fuuto clearly has no intentions to apologize to her, Ema storms off in anger before it turns into a fight.
Not too long after that, Masaomi asks if anyone has seen Wataru. He’s nowhere to be seen, so they all split up to search for him around the island. Ema goes with Kaname to check the back of their cottage, and when it starts raining along the way.. Kaname suddenly hugs Ema to keep her warm. This causes her to feel all ﾄﾞｷ(*´・ω・`*)ﾄﾞｷ[4] inside, until eventually Tsubaki comes to inform them that Wataru has been found. It turns out Wataru only went to take a nap without telling anyone, and he’s really upset when everyone keeps calling him a kid.. so Ukyou decides to punish Wataru by asking him help preparing dinner tonight. If he doesn’t want to be treated like a kid, then he needs to take responsibility like an adult. They’re all drenched thanks to the rain, and Ema pulls Subaru’s wet clothes saying she’ll wash it as a sign of gratitude for the parker.. which only causes him to go Σ(〃д〃) again LOL.
At night Ema takes a walk along the beach, where she meets Kaname again. Despite his usual cheerful demeanor, she notices that he seems different tonight.. and somehow she thinks this might be the real him. Just then a big wave splashes onto Kaname, and when Ema laughs at him, he pulls her into the water too. Here, she notices that he has a cross-like sword tattoo on his right collarbone. When she asks him about it, he only gives her a vague answer that pen is mightier than sword.. but there’s something that’s even more powerful than pens or swords — it’s love. As Kaname whispers those words into Ema’s ears, he suddenly pulls her closer and kisses her on the lips. Juli can only rage in the background until eventually Ema snaps to her senses and runs away from Kaname.
At the end of August, Ema caught a cold and has a slight fever. Wataru finds her looking for medicines in the living room, so he tries to nurse her by following the rules of “aegu / あえぐ” (literally means “to moan”). “A” is for “atatamaru” (get warm), and Wataru takes out his own bedcover to the living room in order to keep Ema warm. “E” is for “eiyou” (nutrition), so Wataru takes out all the food in the fridge until Ema decides to share an ice cream with him — though she feels bad for Ukyou. xD Wataru can’t remember what “GU” stands for, so he decides to spin around with Ema thinking it’s “guru guru mawaru” (spin around) — definitely wrong LOL.
Eventually Masaomi comes to the living room, and upon seeing them spinning around, he asks if they’re dancing together LOL. When Wataru explains that he’s trying to nurse Ema with the rules of “aegu”, Masaomi is shocked and asks who taught him that word. Apparently it was Tsubaki, and Masaomi shows a frightening silent rage upon learning about this. xD Masaomi then examines Ema’s condition, but since he doesn’t bring any thermometers, he decides to take her temperature by putting his forehead against hers. (๑´ლ`๑)♡ Even though he's just treating her like all of his kid-patients, Ema gets really nervous because of this, and she accidentally lifts her shirt too high when Masaomi asks her to show her stomach. He blushes too upon seeing her bra, and especially because she goes “んっ…!” when he touches her stomach. (*ﾉ∀ﾉ)ｲﾔﾝ He says she should be okay if she gets enough rest, and he flees from the living room out of embarrassment LOL. At the end of the day, poor Wataru gets scolded by Ukyou for making a mess in the living room. ﾌﾟｯ(※థэథ)∵.*.∵
After hearing that Ema caught a cold, everyone comes to visit her. Yusuke gives her some medicines, though he got deceived by Tsubaki and ends up giving her a suppository instead. Y⌒Y⌒Y⌒Y⌒Y⌒Y⌒(。A。)ｱﾋｬﾋｬﾋｬﾋｬ!! Rui puts a get-well-soon letter under her door, Subaru leaves some ion drinks on her door handle, and Iori buys a bouquet of sunflowers just for her. Juli doesn’t approve though. He thinks everyone has hidden motives, and he just can’t trust any of them. Not even the gentle Iori, because sunflower means “I’m always looking at you” in flower language. Not too long after Iori leaves, Kaname also comes and gives Ema a cake.. but since Ema is clearly avoiding him, Kaname asks if she’s angry about the kiss. She thinks he can kiss any woman whenever he wants to, but he tells her that she’s wrong. He doesn’t just kiss anyone, and he kissed her because she’s cute — she made him want to kiss her. Kaname says he wants to have a greater kiss after she recovers, so despite everyone wishing for her to get well soon, Ema is now really afraid of recovering.
On the last Saturday of August, Tsubaki and Azusa invite Ema to their live event. She couldn’t go out and play recently because she was sick, so they’re hoping the event can at least give her some good summer memories. Both of them are doing an incredible job at entertaining their fans, and Ema feels really proud to have great brothers like them. After the event ends, Ema suddenly receives a mail from Tsubaki — telling her to come to their dressing room. Right after she walks in, a half-naked Tsubaki suddenly hugs her and kisses her cheek as a reward for entertaining her today. He actually wants to kiss her on the lips, but today he’ll hold back since Ema is resisting and Azusa is glaring at him. Then he kisses Azusa’s cheek too so the latter “won’t get jealous” lol.
Looking back at their first meeting, Yusuke admits that he actually fell in love with Ema at the first sight. He first saw her in spring of their first year, but they were in different classes back then. His love only grew stronger over time, and they were finally placed in the same class on their second year. Tsubaki actually knew that Ema will be their new sister, but he didn’t inform Yusuke on purpose — simply because he loves teasing Yusuke. This causes Yusuke to get a strange feeling, and he started imagining various いちゃいちゃ[5] situation with their new sister.. though he apologized to the girl in his delusions because his heart only belongs to Ema. ❤
On May 22, Yusuke actually talked to Ema at school, but he didn’t know until much later that she’s going to become his new sister. He returned home late because he was summoned by their homeroom teacher, and he was shocked to see her when he got home. Even though he harshly warned her not to call his name at school, Yusuke is actually worried that Ema might be angry because of his attitude towards her.
That night, Yusuke goes down to visit a convenience store. He meets Azusa in the elevator, and they find Ema with Iori on the first floor. Yusuke is surprised to see them together, but Iori calmly explains that he was guiding Ema around the area and showed her the locations of the 24-hour convenience stores nearby — just in case she ever needs anything. At first Yusuke actually felt lucky to live with the girl he loves, but now he realizes that he’s dead wrong. He’s surrounded by extraordinarily strong rivals: the princely Iori, the attentive Azusa, the frivolous Tsubaki, the flirty Kaname, and even a famous idol like Fuuto. As Yusuke screams “I won’t hand Hinata over to anyone! I won’t lose!” in his heart, Azusa holds his shoulder saying this is the difference between popular guys and non-popular guys. Y⌒Y⌒Y⌒Y⌒Y⌒Y⌒(。A。)ｱﾋｬﾋｬﾋｬﾋｬ!!

“Hello out there in TV land Giddon Yago here with the latest edition of you hear it first. What do the WWE and Mud have in common? And no its not a mud wrestling match with two girls in bikinis. Though that might be true as well. The answer is Puddle of Mudd a new band that is the brain child of Mystic McMahon. Check them out in the recording studio.”
“Now to all you wrestling fans out there no your eyes do not deceive you. The lead singer of Puddle of Mudd is none other than the WWE’s own Edge aka Adam Copeland. And don’t worry unlike that Metal horror show courtesy of Fozzy Puddle of Mudd actually has talent. Look out for them soon. And remember you heard it here first.”
Lucky opened his eyes and sniffed the air again. He pushed back Pyra’s sheets, and sighed at the empty spot on her bed. Around 3am he had given up trying to get Pyra to go to sleep and had gone himself. He sniffed the air one more time and he knew there was no denying that scent. He barreled out of the room and down the stairs tackling the owner of said scent.
“Joshua!” Lucky exclaims as tears of joy stream down his face hugging the man again. “Why didn’t you say you were coming home?! Pyra! Pyra!”
“But you’re back now! Pyra! Get the hell out of those fucking books and say hi to Josh! What the fuck is wrong with you?!”
“Oh I’ve been chilling with Orlando a lot, didn’t notice,” Lucky looks at JC and hugs him again smiling broadly. Continue reading →
Betrayal, it’s the way of the world. The closer a person gets the easier it is to drive the knife into your heart. All the more opportunity to stab you in the back. You always have to wonder how they don’t see it coming. How they don’t see the swipe of the blade. Why they don’t believe what is in front of their very faces. The knife that will stab them in the light.
Pyra watched Quinn as rattled his fingers against the table. The man was not pleased, the plan had been for the three of them to go hang out but Mystic was MIA. She was already an hour late and not answering her cell phone. Which wouldn’t have been such a problem if they were planning to meet in What? but the pair was already off the property and sitting in a night club.
”I’m sorry, but after sitting her waiting like a fool for someone who obviously doesn’t think enough of us to answer a call I’m just not in the mood.”
Pyra blinked. She was annoyed at Mystic but not really, she had been late enough times not to hold it against her. She’d be a hypocrite otherwise. Maybe something important had happened or she was too busy screwing Colin to notice the passage of time.
“Maybe she’s tied up.” Pyra says as Quinn pulls on his jacket and pays for both their drinks though his had remained untouched.
”Jynx, for an ancient spirit that can take care of herself you are quite demanding!” A young man of about 20 says to the cat that had just jumped into his lap as he removes his headphones. Its then he hears the ringing. “Oh.”
”Yes mother, we thought they were dead for so long, their parents, then that strange article in the Profit that pretty much lead to nothing back when I was in Chestnut.” ”I know, but that isn’t what worries me. For someone with no training to not only face Sana but destroy her and her realm so swiftly. It’s uncanny and…”
Lucky was sitting in a fancy Italian restaurant with Andrei. He had casually mentioned he was hungry and now he was being treated. They usually spent a couple of nights a week together, Andrei had told him to order what he wanted and he was staring at the letters on the menu. He knew they were letters and they made words but what letters and what words he had no idea.
“May I take your order” The waiter says. Andrei smiles he had dressed Lucky in Armani, and the boy looked dashing. His pants were a little short on Lucky but the overall effect was amazing. He looked years older and he guessed people took them as brothers or lovers.
“You can just order everything if you don’t know what you want.” Lucky rolled his eyes and shoved the menu to Armand. “What is it?” Continue reading →
Welcome to Sports Entertainment Be yourself. The piece of advice you always receive and almost never listen to.
“Sit down, I’m getting motion sickness,” Chris says. Pyra looks at the five guys and sits on the sofa in between Lance and Justin. Finally the television returns to the show it was giving. A young dark haired guy is standing in front of a tv screen and starts with the lines Pyra wants to hear.
“And now for the number one video of the day, but first lets recap the top ten.” Pyra almost has to stifle a scream. “And the number one video today on Total Request is Nsync with Tearin’ up my heart.
“Wait if it was a tape why didn’t you fast forward?” Justin asks. Pyra scratches her head. Continue reading →
Pyra sighed against Billy’s lips as she was tapped for a third time by a Gryffindor on their way to potions the last class of the day and week as it was Friday.
“Oh dear god, people is it that serious?” Pyra sighed banging her head against her boyfriend’s chest. “Fine I’ll go to the damn class on time you freaking weirdoes.”
”Maroon and gold, can you say ick? I just hate those colors and I will not play any part in them decorating the school.”
”Its okay, but actually I like Ravenclaws colors best,” Pyra said as they picked up their bags and heading off to potions walking in a few seconds before Professor Snape.
“Why Pyra how kind of you to grace us with your presence, in a timely fashion,” Snape sneered causing the Slythern’s in the room to laugh led by a snickering Draco.
Pyra didn’t bother to reply as Snape started to fire off questions related to the homework from the night before ignoring Hermonie’s hand and picking on all the students that avoided eye contact.
Snape had long stopped trying to catch her this way, simply because she always answered loud and clear then went back to looking like a delinquent doodling on the edge of her scroll.
