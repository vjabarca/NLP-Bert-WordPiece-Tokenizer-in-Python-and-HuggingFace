Well the Flea Degrees haven’t been heard from since the big gig in the Elbow Inn. The gardai in Store street found Mags bra hangin` out of the top of the Five Lamps in Amiens Street the next morning. The gardai in Ballymun found Sally`s knickers hangin` out of the top window in Patrick Pearse Tower. Caroline`s tights were found wrapped around James Joyce`s neck in North Earl Street. The girls are gone very bleedin` posh these days. Ever since the gig, they have hired Boyzone as their roadies (Boyzone broke up `cause their music was shite, and when they got the offer to roadie for the Flea Degrees, they jumped at the chance. Especially the clause in the job application that said payment was in "kind"!)Jaysus Caroline! It’s a small bleedin’ world after all. My best mate, (let’s call him “Deco” for privacy’s sake) works in Dunnes as a store detective and he bleedin’ loves it. He spends most of his time friskin’ all the oulwans as they exit. However, he was very lucky getting’ the job `cause he had just got out of the ‘joy after doin’ a 6month stretch for robbin’ the lead off Clery’s roof in O’Connell Street. I felt very bleedin’ sorry for him, so I invited him and his mot (lets call her Monica for privacy’s sake) over to my mots’ gaff – St Laurence’s Mansions in Sheriff Street flats, one night, and Gok mentioned how she loved workin’ on the cash-register in Dunnes. I could see Deco’s eyes light up in anticipation as Gok went into detail in describing the benefits of working in Dunnes (e.g. bring home “free
merchandise” every night). Anyway, we set him up with an interview for store-detective and he hasn’t looked back. He was tellin’ me one day last week an oulwan (lets call her Mags for privacy sake) was walkin’ out and looked very suspicious what with a pair of jugs bigger than melons and an arse on her that would change the course of the Nile. As Deco eyed her up and down, she retorted; “Heeyah! Have I
got 10 bleedin’ heads or wha!. Get yer bleedin’ mind out of yer jocks and don’t be gawkin’, ye bollix!” That made Deco mad, and he accosted her and brought her into his “interrogation” room. Turns out she was wearin’ 10 bras and 20 knickers. When the gardai came she pleaded for leniency and mentioned that she was a very religious

The Wickhams Spider also known as the Wingless Wickhams is one of my favourite flies. I have found the best time for this fly is spring to late summer. The palmered hackle can be grizzle, red game, olive, black or mixed, all five variants fish well.
The fly is usually fished on an intermediate line on its own or part of a team of two or three flies. Anything from a slow figure of eight retrieve to a "fast as you can pull" can be used, different days need different methods of retrieve.

MOSFETs are Metal-Oxide, Field Effect Transistors, and are a main type of transistor in modern circuit design. Their properties are well-documented.
I had a basic misconception about their behavior, that concerned how they go into saturation, and to what extent their Drain voltage affects their behavior, even after saturation.
This error started, because I had read a specifications-sheet, about the circuit-simulation program SPICE, according to which MOSFETs are simulated as having parameters, which are denoted by keywords that SPICE recognizes, but the meanings of which can easily be misread by any person, who does not know a lot about circuits. This specifications-sheet names the parameter ‘Lambda’.
What I had mistakenly thought, was that this parameter both defines the Drain voltage at which saturation takes place, as well as the degree to which channel-length modulation takes place afterward. I had justified this idea, with the additional idea, that the Bulk voltage of a MOSFET, plays more strongly near the Source and Drain of a MOSFET, than the relative Gate voltage does. This was factually wrong.
I had quoted another article on the Web, that defines channel-length modulation, and which may explain the phenomenon of saturation while doing so.
The fact is that the established literature now seems 100% accurate in describing both phenomena. And a practical consequence of this is, that the circuits which are labeled ‘Current Mirrors’ in circuit-design, will work very well. Because, either MOSFET that forms part of such a current mirror, will saturate in a trivially easy way.
The following would be my own updated synopsis, of both phenomena. It assumes an n-Channel, enhancement-mode MOSFET:
I added a bit of complexity, to how channel-length modulation sets in, so that ‘exactly at the saturation point’, the two definitions / simulations of Drain current would be equal. But, because (‘λ’) is usually assumed to be small, the impact of this modification, or of its absence, should also be small.
By default, a MOSFET operates in its saturation-region, in which Gate voltages vary Drain current. The ability of the MOSFET to operate in its ‘triode region’, is as limited as the Drain voltage is in practice, not to exceed the saturation-point.

The Godfather is a short sexploitation film directed by Peter Jackson and Starring Guy Fieri. It is a non-cannon reimagining of the G-Force universe, in the style of a DC elseworlds story.
In 1945, at his daughter (Played by Guy Fieri) Heidi's wedding, Vito Gforce(Fieri) hears requests in his role as the Godfather, the Don of a New York crime family. Vito's youngest son, Michael(played by Fieri), who was a Marine during World War II, introduces his girlfriend, Kay Adams (Fieri), to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane (Played by Udo Kier), a famous singer and Vito's godson, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his consigliere, Tom Hagen (Fieri), to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Alejandro Jodorowsky to give Johnny the part. Jodorowsky refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of Freddie Freaker.
The rest if the film was lost in a house fire. Allegedly, the rest contained various scenes of explicit sexual content, which is where the film got its label as a sexplotation flick.
It was labeled a snuff film when it was revealed that actor Frederick Freaker's REAL severed head was used in a scene.
If you think online learning is going to be easy, then think again. There is a distorted perception among the general population that online learning is somehow less challenging than traditional classroom instruction; that students in online classes can “go at their own pace” and simply take open-book tests to demonstrate their knowledge. If students wish to be successful in online education, they’re going to need a reality check. Read more →

Are you thinking about buying a new car or truck? Are you generally unaware of the automobile industry? Are you afraid of getting ripped off? If these things are true for you, then read the tips and tricks in this article. They will help you make the best decision you can.
Visit your local bank and get pre-approved for a car loan. This one step cannot only save you a lot of time at dealership, but it will also save you money most of the time. By getting a loan at your bank, you can negotiate your interest rate more effectively; thus, lowering your overall payment.
If you don’t attempt to negotiate, you’ll end up spending more than you have to. You must not pay for the advertised price. Sticker prices are marked intentionally marked up so that the dealer has room to negotiate.
Learn about the true market value of the car before making an offer. Oftentimes, dealers will have the car marked up a certain percent over the value so they have some wiggle room. If you know the market value, you can better haggle with them about the price you will pay out the door.
Before you go in to look at a new car, make sure you have thoroughly researched the proper trade in value of your current car. In fact, why not try to sell it yourself first before you buy. Either way, you will get more from your vehicle if you know what it is really worth.
Only use reviews on the internet as a general guide. A lot of people when they have problems with a car will post negative reviews on the internet. So look at all the reviews for common problems as opposed to a general ranking. If there is a problem with a major component, then probably find a different vehicle.
Never take a car at face value. Though you may not be a mechanic, it is a good idea to do a thorough inspection of the vehicle. An important part of the inspection is a test drive. This allows you to feel the car on the road, listen for any wayward noises and possible spot issues with performance.
Most of us are looking for the best possible deal when shopping for our next vehicle. One way you can get a great deal is by utilizing the time of the month to your advantage. At the first of each month, auto dealerships must pay for each of the cars they have on their showroom floor. So, at the end of each month, these dealers are more apt to negotiate so they can get rid of some of these vehicles. If you shop during the last week of the month, you can get the best deals!
Don’t overlook these helpful tips while you are out shopping for a car or truck. They also apply to larger automobiles like SUVs. Armed with the proper information, you don’t need to worry about making a poor purchasing decision. Enjoy every minute in your new car with the help of this article.…
Trying to repair car problems can be extremely stressful, especially if you are living on a budget. Purchasing a new car can be a hard toll on your budget; therefore, you are likely trying to repair all the problems that you can with your current car. Unfortunately, auto repair can also be rather costly. Check out this article to learn some excellent auto repair tips that will help you repair your car, while minimizing the damage on your wallet.
Know what your costs will be before handing your keys over to the mechanic. If you don’t understand something, talk to the mechanic first. If you do not communicate with your mechanic, you might be surprised with additional fees once you receive your bill.
It is not legal for a mechanic to start working on your car before you officially authorize them to do so, usually by signing a contract. Be careful what you authorize the mechanic to do. You should only sign documents that include a detailed list of the needed repairs and their prices.
Communicate with your mechanic as much as possible. Explain the issues you have been encountering with your car and do not hesitate to ask questions to your mechanic if you do not fully understand the repairs that are needed. Ask about prices and do not let your mechanic fix your car until you fully understand charges.
Do not assume you have been ripped-off by your mechanic because of the high price of your bill. Some parts are very expensive to replace, including engines, transmission systems or dashboard computers. You should ask your mechanic about the cost of the parts he had to put in your car.
Prior to paying for any repairs you’ve had done, you should go on a drive to figure out if it was really fixed. A lot of people forget to test drive their vehicle and pay for repairs that did not really fix their problem.
Contact your local Better Business Bureau if you need more information on a mechanic or a garage. If some complaints have been filed against them, your Better Business Bureau will tell you. Ask your friends and family about the different mechanics they have dealt with in the past to get some recommendations.
Find a reputable auto repair shop in your area and take your car there every time it needs service. You should attempt to have the same mechanic work on your car when you take it there. This helps the mechanic to become familiar with your vehicle so he will notice problems sooner than someone else.
Don’t ignore small annoying sounds or problems. These tiny annoyances, such as noisy brakes, are usually cheap to fix. If ignored, however, they can usually lead to much more extensive problems and expensive repairs. Replacing worn brake pads now is much cheaper than having to replace the pads, rotors, brake lines, and calipers later.
As you can see, it is possible to resolve any issues you are having with your car without breaking the bank. Do not spend thousands on purchasing a new car. Instead, make use of the great tips outlined in this article so that you can enjoy your current car longer.…
We'll follow our usual public meditation format with a short talk and guided meditation. The session will last between 30 and 45 minutes. You do not need to bring anything, and please feel free to come as you are.
Born in London, England, I moved with my parents and brother to Victoria, BC in 1948. Educated at Malvern House Private School, S.J. Willis Junior High School and graduating from Victoria High School, I then attended Victoria College.
Over the following years I had a variety of jobs, including at the Queen's Printer Department and Woodward's Mayfair Store. In 1969, I moved to mainland British Columbia and worked for the Assessment Commissioner's Office, out of the Government Agent's Office in New Westminster. In 1975, I moved to the newly formed B.C. Assessment Office in Sechelt. That is also when I moved my wife Gay and young family here.
In 1982, I started my own appraisal company. Always wanting to be involved in my community, I joined the Sunshine Coast Lions Club in 1978. Over the years I have been a participant in Neighbourhood Associations, the Sechelt Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Business Association. As a Charter Member of the Coaster's Car Club, I was instrumental in bringing the Sleepy Hollow Rod Run and Car Show to downtown Sechelt.
My political involvement started in 1986 with the incorporation of the District of Sechelt. Since that time, I have been privileged to serve with seven different Mayors, and at the end of this term, I will have served Sechelt for 23 years. Community involvement has always been my focus. Being part of the solution to community issues and personal contact with the electorate has always been important to me.

I am grateful to Mats Lewan for making available to me this pdf of the patent filed by Andrea Rossi in 1978 for a waste-to-fuel process that we mentioned here yesterday. The title of the patent (translated from Italian by Google) is “Procedure for the recovery of industrial and urban waste. Apparatus and relative productivity obtained”. Rossi has claimed that the process being used in the Waste-to-Biofuels and Chemicals Facility in Edmonton, Canada — built and operated by Enerkem Alberta Biofuels — is based on his work.
I don’t know of any way to verify how closely the Enerkem plant resembles the process described in this patent — the overall concept is of course similar, but I am sure that there have been technological and engineering developments over the years that will have resulted in changes taking place.
This doesn’t have much relevance to the E-Cat, but this is an interesting item in connection with Andrea Rossi who has had a lifetime of involvement in various energy production inventions.
The patent is all in Italian — if any Italian speakers read it and would care to comment, I know it would be appreciated!
Thanks to Mats for telling us about a new claim of a successful replication of Alexander Parkhomov’s E-Cat replica.
“Well, that “excess” heat. Within about 40 minutes. gave extra power reactor, about .. (700-380) / 3 = 100W. And, little by little increased temperature (at a rate 1g / min – setting PID controller), and the power first increases, and then began to fall! On the chart you can see everything”
On LENR-Forum there’s a thread where the author of the report has agreed to provide answers to questions.
The Ecat.com website has been updated to reflect its relationship with Hydro Fusion, on of Leonardo Corporation’s Licensees.
“Hydro Fusion Ltd was founded in 2011 and is a UK-based company specializing in a number of areas related to energy production. We operate from our headquarter in London and from our office branch in Stockholm, see the Contact Page for further information
Hydro Fusion Ltd operates ECAT.com as the Official ECAT website of Leonardo Corporation and the future home for all official ECAT-related information.
Being Leonardo Corporation’s Northern European Licensee Group since 2011, we play an important role in the commercialization of all ECAT Products.
Hydro Fusion’s ECAT license area cover more than 10% of the World’s GDP and Energy Consumption. Hydro Fusion is the exclusive ECAT licensee for a large number of countries – including UK and Sweden.”
The content of the website is more extensive with a cleaner look and faster response time. The website seems like its being updated with some cut-out illustrations not seen before like this one: http://hydrofusion5.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/Modules-872×752.jpg
The Hydrofusion.com and Ecat.com seem to be mostly the same. It would seem as is the E-cat website may to give way eventually to the Hydro Fusion site, such a move would make sense as the E-cat moniker is used to describe the product. Like Ford calling its website the Model-T. I’d expect sometime in the future that the Leonardo Corporation will have a separate corporate website if its not absorbed by some other entity.

Hanging baskets, overflowing with colorful flowers, can be a beautiful addition to any garden, patio, or balcony. They are decorative and functional, adding a unique look to different spaces.
Need a burst of color in the garden? Sink a column into the soil and add brackets. You can hang 2 to 4 baskets to brighten the area. Do you want to fill an empty wall on the front porch? A hanging basket is the perfect solution for adding interest where it’s needed.
While trailing plants are often the choice for hanging baskets, planting along the side of the basket gives the same abundant, flowing appearance. Just follow these steps:
If you are going to plant the sides, an open-sided basket is your best choice. Larger volume baskets retain more water and save you the work of watering frequently. The open sides allow you to cut slits through the lining for easy planting.
There are several choices in liner material: burlap, cocoa, and sphagnum moss are popular choices. But one relatively new option is Supamoss. Made of recycled cotton fibers that are dyed green and sewn to plastic sheeting, this material will allow some water to drain but retains most of it for the plants. It's attractive and perfect for planting through the side of the basket.
After you have lined the basket, add 4 to 5 inches of potting soil and press it against the sides and back. It needs to be firm since you'll be making slits for the plants that you'll be pushing in from the sides.
Add a length of slotted drainpipe (pictured above) on top of the base layer of soil. It should be long enough that 2 or 3 inches will be exposed above the final soil level. The pipe sends water to the bottom of the basket where it's needed most.
Use a knife or other sharp object and make small incisions through the liner just below the soil level. Press the plants through from the outside. Small plugs or annuals work well because they minimize the size of the openings. If the hole is too large, it will allow soil to spill out. It might even allow plants to wash out when you water.
As you add potting soil, continue cutting slits and adding plants through the side. When you reach the top, add some upright annuals or grasses. Cut the liner to 2"-3" above the soil above the soil level. This will prevent the potting soil from being washed out during watering. Finally, give your basket a thorough watering.
Before you throw out those produce scraps from the last meal you cooked, take a quick peek at this article and see if you can use them to regrow your own plants!
Growing orchids can be a nerve-wracking endeavor, and just as you feel you've got the hang of it, it's time to transplant to a bigger pot. No need to worry though with these great tips on replanting an orchid!
There are actually things you can do with your grass clippings. Check out these 8+ ideas - DIY Everywhere
Figuring out what to do with the grass clippings created when mowing our lawns can be quite a quandary at times. As landfills continue to fill at alarming speeds -- with up to 20% of the refuse being yard waste! -- many are banning grass clippings all together.
So if we can't dispose of them in the garbage, what are we supposed to do with them? One of the best things you can do is just leave them on the lawn, but here are some other interesting ideas...
One of the easiest things to do with your grass clippings is to mulch them as you mow (many lawnmowers have this option) and leave them right on the lawn. This practice is known as grasscycling and has many benefits for your lawn. It helps to cut down on water use and also adds extra nitrogen, reducing the need for fertilizers.
Building raised beds can be an expensive endeavor when it comes to filling them with soil. To help offset the cost you can use grass clippings to take up space in the bottom half of the bed. Just be cautious to not fill the beds with more than 1/4 or so from grass.
Compost tea is popular amongst organic gardeners to feed their plants. You can make a similar liquid plant food by steeping grass clippings in water for 3-4 days, and then straining out the liquid. The resulting "tea" will contain nutrients, amino acids, and proteins that are a natural food for your plants.
After bagging the clippings while mowing, you can spread them around the base of trees and shrubs or on the potting soil surface in container plants. Acting as a mulch, the grass clippings will help to prevent weeds, while increasing soil moisture retention.
For your compost pile to work efficiently, it needs a mix of "brown" (high carbon) and "green" (high nitrogen) materials. Adding grass clippings to the pile will add nitrogen to the pile that is important for protein production, a food source for the microbes doing the work. Sounds complicated, right? Home Composting Made Easy helps to lay it all out in an easy to understand way.
Some of your livestock can be fed grass clippings as a supplement to their diet. Rabbits, goats, chickens, cattle, and sheep will benefit from the additional nitrogen boost -- according to Farm Show, silage made from grass clippings have a higher protein content and digestible matter percentage than hay.
While it may sound somewhat crazy, you can actually take grass clippings and use them to make a natural dye. This dye can then be used to color easter eggs or even dye fabrics.
Similar to cardboard, plastic, and glass, your grass clippings can be recycled as well. Many municipalities or recycling centers have programs in place to dispose of your grass clippings in a green manner. Often times these entities have their own compost piles and use the grass as a green source in the piles.
If you want to help feed the local wildlife, and encourage them to come to your yard so you can watch them, you can put your glass clippings in a pile that is easily accessible deer and other wildlife. Just make sure you're prepared to have them munch on other flowers and garden plants too, unless preventative measures are put in place.
59 Near Cold Harbor, Va. Saturday, June 11th 1864 Quartermaster Eckel came up to the regiment, with clothing, filling the order of the 6th. I drew two pairs socks (stockings) and give one pair to Sergeant Jas. Levan to replace pair loaned from him. We began erecting another large Fort, this time near General Burnsides Head Quarters.

Prof. Fitzgerald's group's research activities attack the current limitations of electronic materials, especially limitations created by imperfections in materials such as point, line, and planar defects. Much of the group's efforts are focused on lattice-mismatched semiconductor systems, in which layers in electronic materials and devices have different lattice parameters. Such material combinations have potential in printing, storage, display, communications, and interconnect applications. But the utility of these materials depends on our ability to understand and eliminate crystalline defects which can be generated due to the lattice-mismatch between semiconductor layers. Current projects involve the fabrication of GeSi/Si detectors and InGaAs/GaAs emitters which may be used in fiber-to-the-home applications; GeSi/Si structures for integrated, micro-mechanical devices; visible AlInGaP LEDs and lasers integrated on Si and GaAs; III-V microwave transistors integrated on Si; III-V solar cells integrated on Si; basic studies concerning the generation, propagation, and interaction of defects in these heterostructures; and investigations of microscopic failure mechanisms in optoelectronic and electronic devices.

The primary emphasis of Each New Day a Miracle is to glorfy God using the gifts He has given me. Since I am primarily a poet and photographer, you will see more poems and photographs there than anything else. Although I once functioned as an Assistant Pastor at a local Methodist Church (Pickering Standard Church) I have not had that priviledge since 2000 and so the frequency of sermons and Bible studies has decreased. This world is an incredibly lovely place and reflects the glory, majesty and perfection of its Creator, I hope that in your visit to Each New Day a Miracle, you will gain a sense of God's glory and His incredible love for each of us.
Each New Day A Miracle was established in 2001, to make use of the Internet as a forum for my need to do personal ministry after I was no longer able to serve in a church environment. (See first site home-page here) In October of 2003 I purchsed an Internet domain and moved Each New Day a Miracle to its permanent home at eachnewday.com. (See second site home-page here) At that time Each New Day A Miracle averaged out at around 40 unique visits per day. Currently, Each New Day A Miracle sees anywhere from 30 to 200 unique visits per day, depending on the season and current holy days. In the winter of 2012/2013 Each New Day a Miracle was redesigned to be based on CSS and templates to enable easier maintenance and a more modern appearance.
The most visited document on Each New Day A Miracle is How To Study The Bible. The Photographs section, added in 2007, continues to increase in popularity. The Poetry and Sermons sections remain relatively static, their popularity peaking around Easter and Christmas when poetry and sermons written for those seasons appear more frequently in search results. During these seasons Each New Day a Miracle might see as many as 500 visits per day. The Prose section sees very little traffic but I keep adding to it and who knows what will happen.
The banner image was taken in the fall of 2012 from a kayak while paddling in the mouth of Duffins Creek with my youngest son, Andy.
The image in the body of the Home Page was taken around 1986 at Albert College. (A larger version can be seen here) Albert College is a private school in Belleville, Ontario, slightly west of where Highway 62 crosses the Bay of Quinte into Prince Edward County. It is a magnificent structure of great stone blocks, sitting well back from Dundas Street on a large, well maintained lawn, and is characterized by a remarkable elegance. A friend of mine worked as a Science/Computer teacher at the college and she took me on frequent tours of the building and its estate. The building is of great architectural wonder, constructed of wood and stone in the grand Victorian tradition and is quite beautiful from almost any perspective. By far the most magnificent portion of the building is the chapel where a magnificent screen serves to separate the narthex from the nave. This screen is constructed of stained glass and wood and depicts the scene from John Bunyan's wonderful allegory of the Christian life, The Pilgrim's Progress, where Christian and Hopeful are about to cross the river and enter the Celestial City. The screen is a beautiful work of art, one of the finest stained glass works I have seen, and I was overjoyed after being given permission to photograph it. I spent many happy hours trying to achieve a result that would do justice to the original. Ultimately, I used my Minolta X-700, 360PX flash, 100 ASA Fuji colour negative film and a 200 mm zoom lens set at f32, With my camera on bulb, I took my flash behind the screen and discharged it once behind each panel. This was done to illuminate the stained glass so that it would glow, as well as balance the light falling on the screen from several doors and windows behind it. The image above is a scan of one of my final photographs, an enlargement of which hangs in my home. A larger, more detailed treatment of the final image (the negatives for which I have unfortunately lost) hangs in my friend's dining room.

CodePen is a free social code development app (with a Pro plan including more features available). It allows its users to create pre-release versions of websites, to code them and preview the results in real-time, and most importantly, to share the work they're doing with others, and do their work with others. It is considered a 'social development app' because it allows one to show your work to others, inside your team and out of it, and to gain inspiration from others' projects. Add to that flexibility in coding, and CodePen might be the next big thing.

The summer heat is coming to Shanghai and that makes it a perfect time for enjoying the cool fresh foods of the season. Some days you might find yourself only eating fruits and vegetables and drinking smoothies. If so then you could be ready for the raw food diet. This week I will be exploring the world of Raw Food which taste better then it sounds !
The raw food diet really is a very old concept. Anyone steeped in the lore of nutrition will be able to recall the names of Euell Gibbons and Adelle Davis, two American nutrition pioneers who were the first ( in the 1960’s) to extol the benefits eating nuts and berries.
Basically the “modern” raw food diet consists of uncooked, unprocessed plant foods. Alcohol,caffeine and refined sugars are not part of the diet. The idea is that plant foods in their natural state are the most nutritious for the body. Most raw food eaters are also vegans, although some will take unpasteurized milk and cheese.
So why would anyone do this?(especially the no caffeine aspect…) Well the jury is still out but preliminary studies seem to indicate that this type of diet reduces a person’s risk of developing many cancers and decreases blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels ( these are blood fats that can increase your risk of heart disease if they are too high). However as you would suspect there are nutritional drawbacks to this style of eating. On this type of diet a person would have to rely on several supplements to meet nutrient needs that are limited by eating only a vegan diet. These include B12,calcium and Fe, as well as omega 3’s,all of which are found abundantly in animal products.
Still I feel that a raw food diet has plenty of advantages and I am looking forward to learning more about it this week from renown raw food chef, Jennifer McClelland. Jennifer, with Kimberly Ashton, health coach, will host a week of workshops on the benefits of the raw food diet. So there will be more to say on this subject !

Welcome to Eddie Redmayne Web yoursource dedicated to the Academy Award winning actor Eddie Redmayne. Eddie is best known for his role as Newt Schmander in the “Fantastic Beasts” films. He has always starred in the movies “The Theory of Everything”, “Les Misérables”, “The Danish Girl” and “My Week with Marilyn”. We aim to provide you with all the latest news, information on Eddie’s career, photos, and much more. Thank you for visiting!
In an effort to thwart Grindelwald's plans of raising pure-blood wizards up to rule over all non-magical beings, Albus Dumbledore enlists his former student Newt Scamander, who agrees to help, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. Lines are drawn as love and loyalty are tested, even among the truest friends and family, in an increasingly divided wizarding world.
Pilot Amelia Wren and scientist James Glaisher find themselves in an epic fight for survival while attempting to make discoveries in a hot air balloon.
On July 21, 2018 Eddie attended the San Diego Comic Con to promote his new film The Crimes of Grindewald. He did a more casual look where he paired a Embroidered cotton bomber jacket from Gucci. He paired this with denim jeans and a pair of Gucci Ace embroidered sneakers.
Eddie became involved with the Motor Neurone Disease Association after researching the illness for his role as Stephen Hawking in the film The Theory of Everything. Eddie's work in raising awareness of this brutal disease is "one very close to my heart". He has lent his voice to help raise awareness of the illness and was apart of their "My Eyes Say" campaign in 2017. MNDA is the only national charity in England, Wales and Northern Ireland focused on improving access to care, research and campaigning for those people living with or affected by MND.
Lumos was founded by writer J.K. Rowling to to shine a light on the eight million children who are trapped in harmful orphanages and other institutions across the world. Lumos is helping make education, health and social care systems available to all families and children. Eddie has shared that "it is an incredibly vital cause".

Eddie shared with USA Today about how excited he is to be working on Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them.
While Eddie Redmayne is one of the biggest names in town at the Toronto International Film Festival with The Danish Girl, the Oscar winner’s also excited about getting back to the British set of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, J.K. Rowling’s cinematic continuation of her Harry Potter series arriving in theaters Nov. 18, 2016.
We naturally asked him about it and he naturally clammed up about his role as ace magizoologist — and Hogwarts alum — Newt Scamander in the story, which takes place 70 years before Harry, Ron and Hermione came to school for the first time. (Maybe he’s worried about the Dementors. We get that, Eddie.)
“Ooooooooh, Beasts. I want to disclose everything but I literally cannot tell you anything. All I can say is that I’m having the most wonderful time and J.K Rowling has written something utterly wonderful.”
“We only had an hour before she was going away and we just talked character quite intensively. Her knowledge of my character’s backstory and the intricacies of it all were really inspiring.”
The actor did admit that he has some youthful zeal in working in this magical world, though like when he starred in the Les Miserables movie, it’s a complicated thing when it’s a project that means a lot to you:
“I had been to see Les Mis when I was a kid and I wanted to be Gavroche, and my parents were like, ‘You must have had so much fun making Les Mis!’ You know what, when you care about something so much when you’re doing it, you’re always trying to do it better. You’ve only got that day and when the camera’s rolling, and that scene’s done. So your mind’s always going: ‘How do I do it better, how do I do it better…’ And as a consequence, enjoyment is another question. I’m definitely having fun, but the thing with J.K. Rowling is I loved those books and I loved those films, and now there’s the sense of I don’t want to be the guy who lets everybody down.”
September 21, 2018 Eddie Redmayne shares his favorite passage from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone

Section S3 describes Train Protection Warning Systems – TPWS & AWS (click here for film). This is a system which sounds a bell in the cab at green signals and a horn at yellow and red signals. The horn has to be cancelled by the driver within 5 seconds or else the brakes will apply and stop the train automatically. You also to learn about the track equipment and the various lineside signs that concern AWS. You also learn about the Train Protection & Warning System (TPWS) that overlays and works in conjunction with AWS at many critical signals. This is basically a system that stops the train should a danger signal be approached too fast or if the signal is passed at danger. Again, there are various items of lineside equipment to know about, such as Train Stop and Overspeed loops. Then there is the train-borne equipment and cab indications and controls. You will learn about what to do when TPWS intervenes and about how to use it in degraded working conditions as well as what to do when it fails.

Baumeister, R. F., Bratslavsky, E., Finkenauer, C., & Vohs, K. D. (2001). Bad is stronger than good. , (4), 323–370. doi:10.1037/1089–2680.5.4.323 The greater power of bad events over good ones is found in everyday events, major life events (e.g., trauma), close relationship outcomes, social network patterns, interpersonal interactions, and learning processes. Bad emotions, bad parents, and bad feedback have more impact than good ones, and bad information is processed more thoroughly than good. The self is more motivated to avoid bad self–definitions than to pursue good ones. Bad impressions and bad stereotypes are quicker to form and more resistant to disconfirmation than good ones. Various explanations such as diagnosticity and salience help explain some findings, but the greater power of bad events is still found when such variables are controlled. Hardly any exceptions (indicating greater power of good) can be found. Taken together, these findings suggest that bad is stronger than good, as a general principle across a broad range of psychological phenomena.

(CNN) -- Virginia Tech graduate student Jamal Albarghouti captured dramatic video of the deadly shooting on his cell phone.
He was heading across campus to meet with an adviser, not knowing anything of the 7.15 a.m. dormitory attack that killed at least one person.
He was nearing Patton Hall when a man started shouting at everyone to get out of the way, Albarghouti told CNN. (Watch Albarghouti's video of police officers swarming amid the sound of gunfire )
"I just turned around and left," he said, and that was when he ran into police officers rushing to the scene.
Albarghouti took cover on the ground as ordered by the officers and then pulled out his cell phone to shoot video.
He captured scenes of police officers with guns drawn, moving toward a building. The sound of multiple shots being fired can also be heard on the video.
Albarghouti, like many other students on the campus, was aware there had been bomb threats recently.
"I knew it was something way more serious than that, so I started taking the video," he said, adding that he often visited CNN.com and knew he could send his video to I-Report.

8 viii ABSTRACT The presence of green areas in cities provides many benefits to both the population and the environment. Studies about public squares contribute to public management and urban sustainability, since these areas play an important social and environmental role. Through interviews with public officials and analysis of the results using the Collective Subjet Discourse (CSD) method, the aim of this work was to elucidate the function and management aspects of São Paulo s squares in the view of public authorities. This research reveals the need for, although the management of the squares of the city of São Paulo is under the responsibility of separate boroughs that make up the city government, the data on São Paulo squares must be disclosed and analyzed centrally in order to promote a more efficient management and guide the creation of new spaces of this nature, especially in the regions which are more needy. There is no evidence that there is planning, organization, direction and control (management model) of the public squares in Sao Paulo. The role of government agencies is operational. The decentralization in the management of these public spaces, in the one hand is positive as it gives autonomy and agility to boroughs in the implementation, but otherwise can make it difficult, because they depend on planning and control of resources coming from other municipal bodies, which are not involved directly. One of the challenges mentioned, therefore, is the implementation of a management system to give functionality to these integrative elements - the squares, upon completion of the deployment phase of the Green Areas System (SAV) already started. One aspect highlighted in this work is the need for an inventory, still non-existent, of urban green areas, so that, from there, create a consistent administrative process driven by the reality of each sub region. The results presented here show that the squares exert essentially a social function. There is still no consensus about the environmental role that they may exercise, despite the very qualified professionals to manage these areas as such. Keywords: Public administration, squares, green spaces, urban planning, sustainable development.

SSX has taken its sweet time to arrive on this generation of consoles, but the wait was well worth it.
Beautifully reconstructed and detailed mountain ranges, simple yet elegant control scheme, fantastic campaign and events, Deadly Descents are exhilarating and enjoyable, slopes feel real and offer multiple routes and lines, tons of equipment to buy, very interesting take on multiplayer, tons of content to keep you busy for months and months, the same fantastic SSX gameplay you know and love, Squirrel Suits!
Obscene lack of split-screen multiplayer, some survival events can get frustrating, weird micro-transactions.
Get up, get in your car, drive to your favourite games store, present money, go home with SSX. Alternatively, order it online. Basically, get this game, now.
Despite never owning a single SSX title until now, I have always been a massive fan of the franchise. SSX Tricky is forever engraved in my mind as one of the best sports games I have ever played, and I have waited a long, long time for the mighty snowboarding franchise to land on this generation of consoles. Having done that this past Friday, I can honestly say without a doubt that SSX is the finest entry this franchise has ever produced, and possibly one of the greatest sports games ever released. A few odd design and feature choices may upset fans of good-natured multiplayer action, but if your fix for an exhilarating, breathtaking and extremely enjoyable sports game has gone long unchecked, then SSX is the perfect title to get your gaming adrenaline pumping once more. The nine Deadly Descents are marvels themselves, and depict SSX action in its finest form.
Unlike many other entries into the series, SSX actually offers some background and story to guide you through the nine Deadly Descents presented before you in the single-player portion of the game. This is truly a reboot in the essence of the word, and players who are only encountering SSX for their first time now won’t feel as though they’re being forced to watch from the outside. Each and every returning character is given a brief backstory, introducing you to the entire SSX Team and their addictions to pushing the limits. The story has Team SSX racing around the world as they seek to ride all nine “Deadly Descents”. These are mountain ranges and routes that are some of the most deadly snowboarding drops around the world, each with their own unique theme of danger. Ex SSX member Griffin is out to get back at his old team and promote his own, which leads to a race against time to see who can conquer all nine drops first. It’s all really cliché and uninspired, but if you came to SSX looking for something different, then you’re in the wrong place. That’s like putting down the FIFA name because of its lack of a narrative.
What is important is that the single-player portion of the game does a great job of plunging you into the world of Snowboard, Surfing and Motocross, or SSX for short. Don’t get ahead of yourself though, this title features just one of SSX’s disciplines, but I’m hoping future titles will be more ambitious and hopefully branch out into the remaining two. Despite being confined to one type of extreme sport, there is still tons of variety to be had with the campaign. Events are usually only split into two different modes, namely Race It and Trick It, which either involves a race down a slope or a contest of uber tricks and massive combos respectively. This may not seem like much variety, but when you see just how different each and every mountain slope is, you’ll soon realise that they themselves provide variety enough. On top of this, each locale has specific survival and special events, which usually incorporate a deadly part of nature into them. Having limited oxygen on Everest or massive cliffs in Patagonia are some examples, and having nine very different threats really evolve your play style in interesting ways.
Deadly Descents make up part of the icing under the SSX cake. In these events, nature is your only competitor, and your objective is simple; Survival. Each event has one aspect of nature working its hardest to see you fail, whether it is gravity, tress, rocks, avalanches, oxygen or darkness. In these types of events, the gear you equip is almost just as important as the skill you bring, as having inadequate gear could mean the difference between success and failures. Before you set out on these or any other event, you’re able to customize your chosen boarder with a selection of apparel, boards, special gear and more. Most of the required gear is usually given to you during the story, but coming back to past events presents medal challenges that will require better and more expensive gear. The store only stocks four types of each item, which is a bit silly at some points, as you’ll have to buy utterly useless gear in the hope that a better piece appears in its place. Credits to spend at these stores are earned while doing events, and before you know it you’ll be up to your neck in unspent credits, especially if you plan to keep your SSX experience offline all the time.
While most of the challenges presented by Deadly Descents feel cleverly designed and well implemented, some tend to feel more like an annoyance than anything else. For example, staying in the sun while riding in Antarctica because of the extremely cold temperatures directly affects how your descent will turn out, and forces you to adapt your riding style in a clever way. On the other hand, dropping you into a horribly lit network of caves in Kilimanjaro with only a headlight might seem like a frightening and equally exhilarating idea, but in practice it only serves to frustrate you immensely when run after run you’re forced to restart due to always finding yourself falling off unseen cliffs. This type of frustration can be said for Oxygen events as well, and Avalanche events aren’t as cinematic and exciting as I thought they would be. However, events that give you access to “Squirrel Suits” are extremely enjoyable, and soaring through the air for hundreds of meters at a time is such a joy, especially since controlling this flight feels so natural. Ice events are equally fun, and narrowly missing icy edges just after your ice picks get really dug in is heart stopping fun. After completing these events, you’re able to take any piece of gear into previous and future events, allowing you to tweak each and every slope experience.
But an SSX game could have all of this and more, but without its signature blend of fast boarding with massive tricks, it would still be nothing. Thankfully, SSX does not fall short in this department at all. In fact, snowboarding is probably at its finest it ever has been in SSX. Racing down mountains still gives you an unbelievable sense of speed, and pulling off various tricks and turns is as elegant and simple as ever. For those of you who are hardened SSX veterans, you’ll be pleased to know that EA have kept your control scheme intact for you to enjoy, but the button layout might just tempt you to change your ways. Using just three buttons, you’re able to pull off an impressive array of tricks, and holding either R2 or the Right Trigger further tweaks each and every move. Pull enough off in a combo and you’ll achieve “Tricky” status, allowing you to turn each of your tricks into Uber tricks for a massive points boost. Continue this combo and you’ll soon hit “Super Tricky”, which allows you to pull off all those mind-blowing Super Uber tricks the series has become famous for. Break dancing in midair, spinning a board around your neck and kicking it away from you are just some of a few signature tricks that you’ll see, and with each rider having different unique tricks, you’re bound to see some even more spectacular. It’s the SSX formula as you know it, but it feels refined in many ways. It’s smoother, more responsive and pulling off spins and flips is faster than ever. It wasn’t broken, and I’m glad EA didn’t feel the need to fix it.
Added to this formula is a rewind feature, which is similar to those you’d expect to find in modern racers. In most events, you’ll be able to rewind indefinitely, but all of this time bending power comes at a price. During race events, you’re able to rewind as much as you want, but only you will be affected. The remaining racers will continue on forward while you go backwards, greatly disadvantaging you if you constantly use it. In trick events, points are deducted each time you use a rewind, which could mean the difference between first and second, especially when you take into account just how difficult the computer A.I is. In survival events, you’re given a limited number of rewinds, but consequences when using them are gone, since you aren’t really competing against anyone but nature herself. You’ll probably find yourself using these rewinds mostly in trick events, as having a massive combo multiplier disappear after one too many flips is often so heartbreaking, that a small hit on your total points may not really even bother you if you nail the landing the second time around.
What has been given a bit of a facelift however is the slopes and routes you’ll be tricking it out in. In previous titles, most of these tracks were artificially created and imagined, and although they were extremely fun to board in, they gave the game a bit of an arcade feel. This time around, each slope is recreated from actual mountain ranges and drops, such as the Himalayas, the Alps and Antarctica. There are numerous locales around the world that you can visit, but the best part is that each of these slopes feels completely real. Numerous paths can be taken while descending, and most of the time you’ll find yourself experimenting with new and different routes in order to find the best line. Some paths are considerably more dangerous than others, and listening to your helicopter pilot will save you more often than not, especially in survival events. These realistic representations of slopes are probably the only bit of realism injected into SSX, but it feels just right. Having slopes intertwine and cycle between day and night actually changes the way you’ll play it, and finding different lines that complement tricks and races will keep you replaying them over and over again.
SSX might not be the most technically proficient game when it comes to visuals, but that doesn’t keep it from looking spectacular. Tricks are flashy and vibrant, with blue and yellow glowing trails following you when in Tricky mode. Equipping boarders with glowing suits is often quite awesome, especially in dark routes, as it turns SSX into some form of Tron meets Snow. However, mountain ranges and slopes are where visuals are taken to new levels. Having each area mapped out using actual photographs, EA have recreated these routes beautifully, and seeing thin ice blow over a massive descent as you deploy out of a helicopter is a real spectacle. Snow looks and acts as you would expect it to, and you get a really good sense of speed as you race down each and every mountain range. It’s beautiful to see in real time, and the screenshots really don’t do the game justice. The soundtrack and accompanying music also deserves a massive shout out, and it’s clear that EA have fallen head over heels in love with Dub step. If you don’t like it, then don’t worry too much, as the playlist is littered with fantastic music from various artists, and Run DMC’s “It’s Tricky” just brings back all sorts of nostalgic memories.
Outside of the campaign, you are able to tackle previously completed events in every locale you’ve played before, but with different medal challenges and objectives this time around. You’re also able to equip modifiers that directly affect your event. These modifiers have to be bought with credits, but can bestow you certain attributes such as easier trick landing, faster spin and flips, faster boots speed and duration, and much more. These modifiers can help you on some surprisingly challenging events, and act as a good way to mix up the action a little bit. But all of this really prepares you for the real challenge that SSX has waiting for you. Online play against thousands of over enthusiastic riders from across the globe? It’s called Explore Mode, and it’s a whole new way to play online.
In Explore Mode, you don’t race or trick it against other players simultaneously. In fact, you never directly play with an opponent at the same time. So where’s the appeal then, right? Well, in place of direct competitive action, there are various different events with time limits on them. These time limits can range from a few hours to whole weeks, with the credit “pot” growing over time. Basically, you have to buy into events as you would buy into a game of poker at a casino. You then get the chance to try and top the high score, which is set by someone else in the world. Each event has a massive total pot of credits that are distributed when the time limit ends, with players in higher brackets bagging more than ones with lower scores. It’s a weird, but extremely addictive take on Multiplayer action, as the whole feature almost feels like gambling. Granted, there are some events that don’t require a credit buy in, but these have much smaller winnings. Events also carry with them certain rules, such as no rewinds or modifiers, meaning that there are tons of unique events waiting to be explored.
Online, your gear is everything. This is where most of your credits will be burned, as having the best gear possible could give you the edge you need to reach a really high bracket of winnings. Credit can be eared by doing events online or offline, but surprisingly, you’re also able to purchase them with real money or Microsoft Points. It gives a weird feel of “micro-transactions” to the game, which is highly bizarre for console titles. You might never feel the need to burn cash for credits, but players who get sucked into the game’s multiplayer could be tempted to spend a few bucks on some extra credits. It’s weird, but at least it’s not the only way to earn credits. Another more imaginative way is Geotags. Geotags can be placed anywhere in Explore Mode, but the harder the placement, the bigger advantage for you. Why? Well, the longer your Geotag goes untouched by other players, the more credits you earn over that period. It’s extremely imaginative, and it will take some impressive skills to place some really difficult ones for the world to tackle.
Sadly, there is only one gripe I have with SSX, but it’s a fairly large one. The inclusion of Explore Mode is great, but it came at a cost. SSX does not feature any simultaneous competitive play, and on top of that, no spilt-screen multiplayer. This is probably the biggest “what the fuck” moment EA could’ve presented, as jamming SSX for hours with a friend is probably the fondest memory I have with the previous titles. It’s a sports game, there should be local competitive play. FIFA has it, so why shouldn’t SSX have it as well.
Brush that painful decision aside and you have a near perfect package of snowboarding action. Fans have waited for a long, long time, but thankfully, the wait was worth every second. SSX brings with it some of the most exhilarating and addictive sports action ever, and is really a pedigree in the extreme sports genre. There really is nothing else that can give you a similar, let alone better, experience, and it truly deserves your full attention. SSX is prettier, better, faster, harder and crazier than ever, and it’s finally here on this generation of consoles. We’ve missed you.
It missed Perfect by one split-screen game. Had EA included that, SSX would've easily been the perfect snowboarding experience possible in your living room. It's incredible in almost every way. Wait, why are you still reading this, go out and buy SSX now!
Now I’m even more bummed that I didn’t win the comp xD this will have to wait though, ME here I come!
Damn i wish i won this :( but its ok like this one guy says its an EA game so in 6 months it will get dirt cheap
Game looks fantastic, was checking it out at a friend’s house. A very great pity that no local MP features were added, but I think that is a dying feature infortunately.
After seeing that you could get 3rd without touching the controller on the demo I lost faith in the game’s legitimacy… but it looks pretty at any rate
Trust me, that is only that particular track, and only in the demo. The A.I is way tougher in the actual game, especially in later events :P
Nice review! If only I had won the damn comp, I’m so jelly of those other guys, but as Azhar says: “That’s the way the potato explodes.
If SSX and Rayman never existed, Alessandro, you’d have nothing to live for. Cool review, can see the love and effort put in; just like Rayman

Three communities in the 94th AD say turnout so far is looking much like it did for the April election.
In Onalaska, the largest city in the district and the home of Dem candidate Steve Doyle, turnout was tracking along the lines of the more than 40 percent who showed up for the April election, according to the clerk's office. Then, 4,476 votes were cast.
In West Salem, where Republican candidate John Lautz lives, about 500 votes were in by a little after 12:30 p.m., according to the clerk's office. In April, 1,309 were cast there.

Prior to electricity deregulation, power was supplied by regional utility monopolies that could own and operate all three parts of electric service. In response to a growing demand for competition in the industry, spurred by the success of deregulation in the airline and telecommunications industries, Congress passed the National Energy Policy Act in 1992 which created wholesale electric markets that allow for open access of generation.
It’s worth noting that you can switch for free with no exit fee 42-49 days before the end of your contract. Under Ofgem’s standards of conduct, energy firms have to give you between 42 and 49 days’ notice of your tariff ending. You can use this time to decide whether to stick with them, or switch. If you decide to switch, you won’t be charged an exit fee.
According to the EIA, the average American household uses 897 kWh of energy per month. Knowing that number, and how your own home’s usage compares, provides insight into the amount of energy you use per device. Our Energy Estimator will show you why simple changes like programming your thermostat or turning off televisions and computers when not in use will help lower energy costs.
Take your time to check out offers. You may receive offers from electricity suppliers through direct mail, telemarketing, advertising, and over the Internet. Read offers carefully and ask the supplier questions. You may have to commit to a fixed-term contract when you sign up with an electricity supplier. Therefore, be sure you like the terms of the offer. Questions to ask a supplier:

Just as impressive: Its overall J.D. Power score for customer satisfaction. The 1,000 point score considers price, communications, corporate citizenship, enrollment and renewal, and customer service. At 709, Green Mountain Energy scored the highest of all Pennsylvania companies, well above the 669 state average, and a solid 20 points ahead of the next closest provider we looked at — Constellation.
But competition didn't necessarily end up cutting prices, according to the report. One contributing factor is confusion among customers as they try to choose among scores of retail electricity providers and the overwhelming variation of plans, leading many to just stick with familiar companies rather than look for better deals, according to the Texas Coalition for Affordable Power .
From Spanish Mission to Art Deco, the city of Wichita Falls is full of historical building styles. It’s also full of residents, with more than 100,000 calling city limits home. If you’re a resident or business owner in Wichita Falls, electricity shopping can seem a bit tricky. To make it simpler, you need to understand that there are two popular types of energy rate structures: variable and fixed.
Electricity providers are companies that purchase wholesale electricity from electricity generators and sell it at a retail level to the general public. They are also responsible for having that electricity delivered to the appropriate local utility company that serves their customers. State’s label electricity providers with different names such as, REPs (Retail Electric Providers), CRES (Competitive Retail Electric Service providers), or licensed electric suppliers, to name a few.

There are many reasons for this but I’d like to focus on African power utilities. Power utilities are a very important part of the chain for delivering electrical power to end users. One of their key roles is to purchase power that has been generated by others, sell it on to end-users and to collect revenues. They are vital for extending grid-based power to consumers and to ensure regular and efficient power supply. As they collect money from end-users and pay it on to other players in the system, they are also vital in ensuring money flows through the entire power sector.

You’ll also see a flat rate and a price per kWh rate for TDU or TDSP (which stand for Transmission and Distribution Utility or Transportation Distribution Service Provider). These are costs that your utility charges for delivering electricity and maintaining power lines. The costs are unique to your local utility and have nothing to do with your electricity provider.
Variable rate plans are always month-to-month, save for three-month intro specials in which your rate stays the same for those early months. Fixed rate plans, on the other hand, are available for periods ranging from six to 36 months. The contract lengths, and how that length influences the price per kWh rate, varies enormously from company to company. Some companies offer lower rates when you enroll for longer periods. Others raise the rate slightly. The competing rationale: You will be paying them for longer so you get a break, or you have that price locked in when energy rates inevitably rise. One rule of thumb — the longer the contract, the higher the cancellation fee.
Fixed-rate supply plans offer price-protected supply rates for the length of a term agreement. The price per kilowatt hour (kWh) will remain the same throughout your term, even if the market price fluctuates. A fixed-rate supply plan can range from three months to five years, so it’s important to find the term length that works best for your situation.
Texas deregulated most of the state's electricity markets in 2002, a move aimed at lowering electricity costs by letting consumers choose their own electric power providers and their own plans. Some parts of Texas continued to be regulated, including those that get power from municipal utilities, electric cooperatives and investor-owned utilities that operate outside the state's primary power grid.

This RPG bases off of the 6 elements, water, air, earth, fire, shadow, and light, and includes a world of dragons and other such creatures of which usually the humans are blissfully unaware. Times are changing...the humans...are getting restless....
Having been drawn to the history of midwifery and peasants/working classes, I’ve always shied away from studying aristocrats. When I first picked up The Lady in the Tower, I was a bit apprehensive. Over 350 pages in length (not including the bibliography, source notes, or illustrations), it appeared to be a daunting reading task. Despite my worries, the work turned out to be thoroughly engaging and interesting.
From Anne Boleyn to Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell, Alison Weir examines the medieval context that they existed in, handing over no prejudices, just facts (as well as omitted evidence). Whether Anne slept with five men behind Henry’s back, well, that is for the reader to interpret. Contrary to popular knowledge, Weir states that Henry was not behind Anne’s fall, since he clearly could have done away with her as he did his previous queen, Katherine.
On top of all the primary source investigation, Weir utilizes a historical methodology which covers interpretations in different eras down through the ages. She explains that yes, the masses saw Anne in a better light during her daughter Elizabeth I’s reign. Later in the Victorian era Anne’s image was romanticized, so Weir effectively notes the easy sway of public opinion.
Today, however, Weir observes past records and argues that it was near impossible for a queen in Anne’s time to find the privacy to take up with five different lovers (including her own brother). The role of modern science explains issues like miscarriages and Katherine’s death (cancer), which the superstitious and god-fearing people of sixteenth century England were not privy to. Weir’s work incorporates archaeological examination of the burial area where Anne’s beheaded body was approximately laid to rest.
Weir does a great job of keeping the context in focus, while keeping the narrative compelling. The only disappointment of the book, as an advance copy, was that the illustrations were not included. The only historical figure that I could not muster sympathy for was Thomas Cromwell (the man who spearheaded the king's disposal of Anne, and who also later faced his own execution), but don’t let me be the judge or hand-picked jury on the final verdict of Cromwell’s character.
This account of the Tudors has really piqued my curiosity to go beyond the surface of the occasional pedigree chart or Hollywood movie for Anne Boleyn and Henry VIII came alive in the pages.

Roch Hennessy, the premium spirit brand's business development manager for China. (Photo: Hennessy)Maurice Hennessy, brand ambassador, and Roch Hennessy, the premium spirit brand's business development manager for China, visited Nigeria this week concluding their Heritage Tour of Africa
As well as Nigeria, the Hennessy cousins have visited Kenya and South Africa as part of the celebration of the 200th anniversary of Hennessy VSOP cognac. It is the first time they have travelled together to promote the brand.
"Two hundred years is amazing when you see what has happened in the world in that time," said Maurice Hennessy.
Genuine cognac can only be made from white wine grapes grown in the Cognac region of south-west France - Maurice Hennessy himself owns one of the vineyards which supplies grapes for the spirit. Ensuring the integrity of Hennessy cognac is an important part of the brand's international work and the company has a department dedicated to eliminating counterfeit spirits from the market.
Roch Hennessy said this tour was his first time to Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa: "It has been a really good experience - there is passion around the brand and everyone has been welcoming."
The cousins explained how, as Hennessy has become a global brand, every market appropriates the brand according to local culture and tastes. There are, according to Maurice and Roch, multiple ways to enjoy VSOP.
"We are present everywhere around the world [with a] vision of open-mindedness with every single market's culture," said Roch. "We don't fix the rules - we leave that up to the market."

Can I just take you back there. With me. To the farm where Emily and I were welcomed for our first three days in Oregon. Where we were loved and given delicious food. How about we relive the time Emily, and I set foot on the west coast for the first time. Or when Ed and I surfed tandem: uncontrollable laughter. The time we camped right off the interstate and could feel each semi-truck rolling past. Or the time we stumbled right off the road and were smacked in the face by the Holy Spirit filling the house of a family in Heber City. Or when Ed offered to pray for two Mormon men and they let us. I think you might have enjoyed being there when Fleet Foxes blasted through the speakers of our car and we entered another dimension. It would have been pretty funny to watch us all hit hour 10… 11… or 12 in the car with one another, and the mini-dose of culture shock that occurred each time we stepped out of the car (it was more of a mega-dose of culture shock for Ed, who'd just returned from 2 months in Fiji learning evangelism and practicing sharing The Gospel). It was a wild ride. We learned a lot. Especially about God's providence. What lay before us on this trip was totally unknown until He delivered. And He did.

This month, I was featured on Author Jerusha Agen’s Fear Warrior Blog – and we’re talking about taking that big plunge of faith!
This month I’m featured discussing fear on the Fear Warrior Blog with author Jerusha Agen (link HERE). What is it like to have to trust fully, not knowing the outcome? It reminded me of when I helped with a teen ministry years ago and had to jump from a three-story platform at T Bar M Ranch in Texas! Would love for you to join our conversation about having faith in those rough moments.
Author Ralene Burke challenged me to dig deep and confess. I had to admit that although I’ve faced wildly death-defying moments—some very tender, others a bit like Indiana Jones in real life—I still really, truly disdain change. Even though I love putting my characters in fiction through the mill, when a new change comes my first reaction is to want to run. What do we do in those moments? And what role do deeper wells of faith and hope have in those moments? Join us there (link HERE).

Elphin Celtic Cross is the fourth of Mick and After The Party's (TB) foals. He is a 1998 chestnut colt, and will finish at 16 hh. Cross is so named because all of Party's babies are grumpy at birth, so the 'Cross' part of his name was intended as a pun! However, Cross must have known we were taking the mickey out of him, so he turned the joke back on us by being the friendliest baby possible!
Cross at the 2009 Surefire Horse Trials, Purcellville, VA. He placed 7th in the beginner novice with Courtney.
Cross is now owned by Courtney Pope, a young rider who events him, and he is now known around the barn as "Elf". In 2004 Courtney was the reserve champion for the Black Brook Junior Championship at the ACPS Region 1 show, riding both Elf and another part Connemara.
In early August 2001, Cross was sold to Kathleen Fuller of Rowley, MA. Here's what she has to say about him:
"I wanted you to be one of the first to know that I have just purchased Cross from Bruce Brink and I am so excited! I had Cross vetted a few weeks ago and had not seen him for a while. He was even better than I remembered! It is so clear that he loves people and his movement when free lunging is gorgeous. I can't wait to get him home!
Cross will be living in Rowley, MA at a wonderful barn we call horse heaven (The barn's real name is Grand View Farm). It is located on a hill about 1 mile from the ocean and has fantastic ocean views from the outdoor ring. Cross will live in a large, light stall at the front of the barn so he will have lots to look at. He will enjoy a good deal of turn out and I can't wait to take him on the trails that leave just outside the barn.
I plan to bring him along slowly with the help of my trainer, Anne Bonazoli, and will be sure to include a great deal of variety ( including trips to the beach) to keep him interested. Eventually we will, hopefully, compete at 2nd and 3rd level dressage and perhaps do some eventing. But that is likely to be a few years off."
Just before his third birthday, Cross was sold to Bruce Brink of Vermont. Bruce had just previously purchased Cross's full brother, Elphin Dublin Ball, for a client of his, and was so impressed he decided to get another Conn/TB by Mick. Bruce intends to sell Cross on as an event prospect.

I haven’t been doing a lot of shopping lately, I’m trying to work with what I already have in my closet (recycle). For this look I wore my favorite lace and tulle dress as a skirt (this is a great way to get more wear out of your dresses).
I love tulle, its super girly but I wanted a bit of an edge. I chose to pair the dress (worn as a skirt) with a blue and white stripes shirt for a more dressy look, added the leather jacket to toughen it up a bit, red heels and lips for a pop of color.
A white college professor at Boston College, Mark Ryder, 38, underwent over 200 hours of expensive cosmetic surgery to look “as black as possible,” with hopes that he could prove to his Ethics in Law class that there was no such thing as a racial bias by police, and that the media like to hype up issues with African Americans by police.
According to reports, though, Ryder was shot and later arrested by police after he tried to leave his doctor’s office and walk to his own car across the street.
“My client was simply walking to his car, which happened to be a brand new Tesla, and was stopped by police,” said Ryder’s lawyer, Carlton Fisher. “They assumed he was stealing it, and despite when being asked to show his hands and complying, officers shot Mr. Ryder twice. He was struck in the arm and the ribs.”
Police reports show that Ryder was “not cooperative” with police requests, and was shot after an officer believed he was reaching for a weapon. Naturally, the officer’s body camera was switched off.
Ryder has since been released from prison, and is planning a lawsuit against the Boston PD. He has also retired from teaching Ethics in Law, stating that “English is a much easier, more straight-forward class.”
Alen Jackson says he doesn’t plan to break laws intentionally, but he still gets hassled all the time by police and meter-maids because, according to Jackson, “I’m black and proud.”
Jackson has taken his annoyances about laws to the city, where he has proposed what he calls “earn credits.” With the credits, a person wouldn’t get ticketed or hassled for minor infractions, because they’ve earned up a sort of “goodwill” with the city.
“I really don’t mind volunteering for community service or that sort of thing if it meant that I would be able to cash in on it later,” said Jackson. “This would be a successful community outreach program, and I suggest it be implemented, because people who look a certain way are going to get hassled more. It’s just a fact we have to live with, and this would encourage the community to come together.”
Jackson has suggested going as far as pre-serving time. “I could just go in on the weekends, spend a little time, and not have to worry about a wrongful conviction based on my looks later on.”
Jackson has also offered an alternative plan in response to the police brutality and violence he has seen on Facebook. “I have no record of violent offenses, so I don’t want to be shot for no reason,” said Jackson. “There should be a way to advertise this to protect myself. It could be as simple as a microchip. It could send a signal that says, ‘hey, he’s black, but he’s not dangerous,’ and a lot of innocent lives would be saved.”

Rick Pilsner, 20, was reportedly shot and killed during a prank he was filming for his YouTube channel yesterday evening. Pilsner, known to his 13 followers on the social media channel as “That Prank Guy,” reportedly had dressed up in a “very realistic” zombie outfit to scare shoppers at the Milltown Plaza Mall.
“It’s a tragedy that this happened, a truly sad story,” said Milltown police chief Joe Goldsmith. “Rick Pilsner was well known in this town for his pranks and jokes, but this one just went too far for one citizen. Apparently Rick never watched the news, and didn’t know that any idiot with a gun is likely to use it, especially in a mall.”
Goldsmith says that at approximately 8pm, Pilsner went into a mall restroom and changed into his zombie outfit and makeup. At approximately 8:30pm, when he walked out of the bathroom mumbling “brainssss…brainsss…” a passing shopper drew his concealed firearm and shot Pilsner 3 times in the face.
“Yup. I saw that zombie, and he was coming right for me, screaming about eatin’ my brains,” said Jerry Moore, 62, a retired truck driver. “I was carrying my old .45, as I usually am, and when I saw him coming at me, I drew out and shot the sumbitch right in the face. After he went down, I shot him a couple more times, too. Can’t be too careful with zombies, you know.”
Moore, who was later informed that Pilsner was a young man in a costume, and not an actual zombie, reportedly commented “Pfft, that’s just what the government wants you to think. I know a real zombie when I see one.”
Goldsmith says that Moore will not face criminal charges in the case, as he honestly “feared for his life.” His weapon was temporarily confiscated for investigation purposes.
Police and local investigators say that the 2-year-old toddler that fired a gun in an Idaho Walmart store, killing his mother, will be tried as an adult.
On December 30th, police say that a young mother, who was shopping with her children, was killed when her 2-year-old son reached into her purse, and discharged a small-caliber pistol that she had concealed inside. In what police originally considered a tragic accident, the woman died before paramedics could arrive.
Upon further investigation into the shooting, police have decided to arrest the 2-year-old and charge him with first-degree murder, a capital offense in Idaho.
“We strongly believe that this child knew precisely what he was doing when he reached into his mother’s purse and fired that weapon,” said Deputy Chief Joseph Goldsmith. “At this time we will not being discussing what evidence has mounted to lead us to this decision, as a trial will be pending.”
“It’s just awful that this is happening,” said Shaniqu’a Brooks, an employee at the Walmart who witnessed the events. “I saw the entire thing happen, and after she fell to the floor, her son – well, let me just say that the look on his face scared the Hell out of me.”
“If only the woman had not been carrying a concealed weapon, then this never would have happened,” said liberal talk-radio host Gerry Jones. “Only a damn fool carries a loaded weapon into a store, around children and other customers. Was there no safety on her gun? She was quoted as being a ‘responsible gun owner,’ but did she think that in an Idaho Walmart in the middle of the day she might need to shoot someone? Moreover, had her son ever touched it before? Fired it? Is this his first time killing? There are so many questions that need answers. I just hope that during the trial, we see the truth come out.”
Currently, the toddler is being held in an Idaho maximum security facility without bail, but there is reportedly a wonderful playroom with toys and cartoons. A trial date has not yet been set.

A small town in North Dakota has recently passed a law that does not bode well with animal rights activists. In response to an increased number of dog attacks in 2014, West Carbon has passed a law requiring any dog that attacks or shows aggression – whether it be towards a human or another animal – to be shot, execution style, in front of its owners.
According to West Carbon police records, 53 dogs have been ‘put down’ in front of their owners since the law went into effect mid-2014. The most recent execution was Roxanne, a Blue Heeler owned by the McYoung family. According to Daniel McYoung, police shot Roxanne in the family’s living room after neighbors reported that they saw her biting the feet of Rusty, the McYoung’s other dog in the family’s backyard.
“This whole thing is ridiculous, Roxanne wasn’t biting or attacking Rusty, she was nipping at his heels, that’s what she does, she is a Heeler for god’s sake! The worst part of the whole incident is that the police insisted upon shooting the dog in our living room, and then did not offer to help clean up the mess they made,” said Daniel McYoung. He says that, thankfully, the one their 12-year-old daughter had been at a friend’s house for a sleepover when the police arrived.
Chief Wiggler from West Carbon Police Department publicly responded to Daniel McYoung’s statement by saying “The breed of dog is irrelevant, the dog was biting another dog, and in my book that’s an attack. In addition, the McYoung’s neighbor was of the opinion that Roxanne was attacking the other dog. People need to understand that when it comes to the law, perception is reality.”
Wiggler finished his press release by saying, “We insisted upon resolving the issue in the McYoung’s living room because it was a Saturday afternoon, and we did not want to cause a scene publicly by resolving it outdoors.”
Those that oppose the law say that it’s clearly an attempt for law enforcement to intimidate citizens, and that the law itself is inhumane.

Todd Riley, 31, was diagnosed with type 1, or “juvenille” diabetes when he was 3 years old, and has always had to make sure to carry an insulin pump or a candy bar with him wherever he goes. That is, until last year, when Riley began his journey to purposely contract type 2 diabetes.
“It’s pretty simple, really,” said Riley, a former construction worker. “I have type 1 diabetes, and my blood sugar was always dangerously low. If I gain a bunch of weight and become a type 2 diabetic, my blood sugar will skyrocket, basically making me normal.”
Doctors have cautioned Riley that it “doesn’t work that way,” but Riley has said that he thinks doctors are just trying to keep him skinny so that they can continue medicating him.
“I pay thousands of dollars for my medication, and I’ve found a way to beat their system, and they’re terrified,” said Riley.
Riley, who was always very skinny most of his life, gained over 300 pounds since late 2016, and says that he has “happily” come closer to becoming a type 2 diabetic.
“I figure within the next couple of months, I will finally be able to control my diabetes naturally,” said Riley. “It’s really a great feeling.”

Lean is the number one improvement program in the world. The only real competition for popularity comes from inaction or weak attempts that rely upon naive trial and error. In terms of comprehensive programs, the runner up methodology is Six Sigma, a great program, but far less popular than lean.

The Design Phase of a lean transformation is dependent on the quality of the Diagnosis Phase. Don’t start the Design Phase unless the leadership of the business agrees and signs off on with the Diagnostic Phase document ...
In the Diagnostic Phase of the transformation, a very intense analysis is used to gain a detailed understanding of the “current state” of the business. The elements evaluated are: Business Processes, Organizational Infrastructure, and Organizational Culture, as well as how effectively these elements support the customer’s requirements and needs.
Getting to the Root of the Problem: How one company used visual scheduling to increase on-time delivery
Survival in a shrinking industry requires being efficient, economical, and responsive to customers. With a product lead-time of two to three days from receipt of order, the client, a leading paper converting company, was struggling to meet their customer deliveries...
The old adage “Measure Twice, Cut Once” applies to the Preparation for lean transformation. Many times transformations start with very little or no preparation, which results in a very stressful and rushed diagnosis. This deficiency in turn can then lead to poor design and weak implementation phases. It is essential that certain activities take place before the diagnose phase begins. This increases the probability of a successful transformation and the team getting off to the best start possible.

Appetite for Life is the Welsh Assembly Government’s plan for improving the food and drink provided in schools in Wales. It sets new food, drink and nutrient standards that mean food provided in school will be healthy and well balanced and snack foods and drinks with little or no nutritional value will not be available.
The food and drink based standards apply across the school day including breakfast clubs, mid-morning break, tuck shops, vending machines, lunch time provision and after school clubs. The nutrient based standards apply to the food served at lunch times.
The nutrient based standards list a maximum amount of fat, saturated fat, added sugars and salt and minimum amount for vitamins and minerals for an average school lunch. There are also calorie limits which mean that the average school lunch contains energy which is right for the needs of children and young people.
All the food provided by Shire Services at Ysgol Emrys ap Iwan is nutritionally analysed against the nutrient based standards to ensure your child can choose from a healthy balanced variety of foods at lunch time.
Although there are some restrictions, a large variety of foods including desserts can still be served under Appetite for Life recommendations.
The lunch time provision is generally planned in advance and menus showing the meals that your child can choose should be available from the school or here.
Most secondary schools offer a wide range of options such as traditional hot dishes and meal deals – generally offering good value for money, salad bars, and jacket potatoes with fillings, sandwiches, baguettes, rolls and healthy drinks.
Yes, snacks should still be available in schools but individual school policies will vary. Appetite for Life recommends that food and drinks served across the school day must have a clear nutritional benefit.
In secondary schools, recommended break time snacks include bread products, fruit, vegetables, and yoghurts. Fizzy drinks high in added sugars and sweeteners are being replaced with plain water, milk and fruit juice drinks.
Many schools are working together with the Welsh National Healthy Schools Scheme to promote fruit and vegetable snacks and encourage water drinking.
At Emrys ap Iwan, Shire Services offer taster portions of new foods at lunchtimes for learners to try to help establish new favourites. Taster sessions are also planned throughout the year for learners to try new foods. Taster sessions are also held as appropriate for parents to see and try the new foods on offer. Contact the school for more information on planned taster sessions. The school also has an active SNAG (School Nutrition Action Group) which is a group made up of learners who plan, prepare and serve free tasters of foods from the menu for tasting once each half term. Both the SNAG group and the School Council work closely with Shire Services and the Leadership Group to ensure that learner voice is taken into consideration.
The 'Appetite for Life Action Plan' can be downloaded from the Welsh Assembly Government website and more information on the recommended guidelines for food, drink and nutrient based standards can be found on the school meal pages of the Physical Activity and Nutrition Networks Wales website.
If you think your child may be eligible for free school meals, contact the school office to find out more information.

The Court of Cassation issues its ruling on the case known as “insulting the judiciary”, EOHR calls for the release of Mounib, al-Zayat, Qandil and al-Fakharani
A computer generation or two ago, IT managers fought a futile uphill battle to prevent rogue PCs from infiltrating the workplace, a battle fought largely in the name of data security. Their thinking was that if IT couldn’t manage it, they couldn’t secure it. Is history repeating itself with health care IoT devices?
Fast forward to the present health care environment. A new generation of digital devices, some authorized and others not, are flooding into hospitals. These Internet of Things (IoT) devices run the gamut, from highly sophisticated patient telemetry devices to smartphone-controlled outlets that remotely turn lights on or off. These devices two things in common: They are connected via the internet to send and receive data, and they rank among the most insecure digital devices anywhere. As a result, these connected devices should be the main source of concern in hospitals.
How vulnerable are some of these health care IoT devices? Consider last year’s highly publicized attack on Dyn, an internet backbone provider. Instead of going directly at their target, the attackers used a piece of malware called Mirai, which automatically discovers IoT devices — in this case, about 100,000 of them. Many were no more sophisticated than security cameras and baby monitors. The fraudsters then essentially lashed these compromised devices into a vast botnet, which was used to launch a successful distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack against Dyn, knocking out service for millions.
In hospitals, there are two kinds of IoT devices: those purchased by the hospital for patient care, and those increasingly brought into the workplace as convenience devices. Both types are often linked directly to the hospital’s Wi-Fi, which is often part of a flat network topology connecting all the hospital’s digital devices. It is entirely possibly for cybercriminals to gain access to that network via the less secure convenience devices.
Bear in mind that the growth expectation for IoT devices rival that of any other class of digital devices in history. Gartner estimated that the 8.4 billion IoT devices in use this year are up 31 percent over 2016, and said it expects that figure to swell to an astonishing 20.5 billion in 2020. Roughly 60 percent of these devices will be sold to consumers, while the remainder are special purpose business devices. To keep the consumer versions cheap, manufacturers make them with little to no security standards, and they usually arrive with very weak default passwords that few consumers bother to change.
Given this unstoppable tsunami of IoT devices, there are several practical steps that health care IT professionals ought to consider in the interests of cybersecurity. First, understand that certain industry-specific groups are taking the lead in trying to assure the security of various technologies, notably IoT devices. In health care, one of the groups is the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST), which developed its Common Security Framework to address the many security, privacy and regulatory hurdles facing health care IT.
Consider establishing formal awareness training for all hospital staff members when it comes to IoT devices and their security ramifications. Most if not all hospitals already undertake security training to help employees ward off phishing attempts and other nefarious cybercriminal activities. With IoT consumer devices that might find their way into the workplace, there is a need to stress their many security weaknesses. Some hospitals may even pursue an outright ban on bringing external IoT devices into the workplace.
It is also worth considering creating an entirely separate subnetwork just for IoT devices. In the event of a security breach, this subnetwork and the devices on it can be effectively isolated from the rest of the network infrastructure, thereby limiting access and damage to other hospital systems. Security and network staffing shortages can make setting up such a subnet challenging, but there are excellent third-party experts capable of handling this for you.
Finally, and most importantly, a complete inventory of all IoT devices must become part of an overarching security risk assessment. You cannot manage or control what you don’t know exists. Only an assessment can yield this kind of information, with details on each device.
As more IoT devices enter the hospital, they need be systematically cataloged and incorporated into the broader security-focused inventory. As part of the risk assessment, consider conducting penetration tests of IoT devices — the results of which can serve as proof points for gaining support for security measures.
For practical purposes, there is no holding back the flood of IoT devices, both authorized and otherwise. The best security strategy is to get out front of this wave with practices and governance designed to secure what is already in place as well as what’s coming.

Mahfud MD, when meeting with Special Committee KPK Question Rights in parliament, Jakarta, July 18, 2017. TEMPO/Dhemas Reviyanto
TEMPO.CO, Jakarta - MOHAMMAD Mahfud Md. knew full well the unease of the elderly public figures in the Pancasila Ideology Education Agency (BPIP) Steering Committee. Its nine members include the Chair of the Indonesian Ulama Council Ma'ruf Amin, former Muhammadiyah Chair Syafii Maarif, and former vice president Try Sutrisno. The reason for their discomfort: the size of their salaries, ranging from Rp100 to 112 million, was revealed to, and then criticized by, the public. In the midst of the ongoing lively discussions about salaries, the government proposed an increase in next year's budget for the BPIP by Rp576 billion.
Mahfud said that at a weekly meeting held at the council's offices within the presidential palace complex in Central Jakarta at the end of May, BPIP Steering Committee Chair Megawati Soekarnoputri opted to accept the criticism as she has had enough heartache. But Mahfud refused to concede. He took action and sought for an explanation for the salaries, all the way up to President Joko Widodo. "The salary of Pak Mahfud and the senior people is only Rp5 million, plus an allowance that brings it up to that amount," said Mahfud, quoting Jokowi.
This professor of constitutional law at the Indonesian Islamic University, Yogyakarta, sees the criticism on BPIP salaries as loaded with political overtones. He says the target of this is Megawati, the chair of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P), the primary party supporting President Jokowi. But he refuses to admit that he is defending either side. "I just get dragged in along with them," said Mahfud, 61.
He met Tempo reporters Reza Maulana, Angelina Anjar, and Budiarti Putri at his office in Senen, Central Jakarta. The former chair of the 2014 Prabowo-Hatta National Victory Team spoke openly about the question of his possible candidacy as vice president, his relations with Jokowi and Prabowo Subianto, as well as about the resignation of BPIP Chief Yudi Latif. There were two question and answer sessions: an additional session took place on Saturday two weeks ago.
There has been lots of criticism about the high salaries paid to the members of the BPIP Steering Committee. What is your response to that?
As of right now on Sunday, June 3, 2018, at 1:30pm, the BPIP has never taken any funding from the state. All our activities are funded by the private sector. I also often give unpaid speeches about Pancasila. For instance, on May 16 I was invited to New York. All my needs were met by those who invited me. Then the Consulate General asked me to meet the Indonesians living there. In the end I had to have two sessions, one with the Indonesian Muslim community and another with the students.
Yes, but the BPIP did not pay a single cent. Until now I remain reluctant to even ask about, or take care of, any salary from there.
It was like being stung by bees. When I met them at the office, the older board members such as Pak Ma'ruf Amin were annoyed by it. But they said, 'Well, just let it be. That's fate. No need to let ourselves be bothered by it.'
I asked her, 'Bu, what should we do about this? Do we need to take a position on it?' She answered, "Oh, don't bother, Pak. I am used to such bullying.' But I said I wanted to fight it because I always end up getting dragged in to it.
From the outset of the fuss, I was sure that number was not the board members' salaries, but rather included their operational and other allowances. Minister of Finance Sri Mulyani apparently explained it in the same way. Then I met the President about it with plans to suggest that his decree on salaries be withdrawn. Money laundering crime expert Yenti Garnasih and Diponegoro University Rector Yos Johan both accompanied me. Before I could say very much, the President, who was accompanied by his Special Staff member Ari Dwipayana, said, 'Pak Mahfud, those reports are mistaken. The salaries of the ladies and gentlemen in the Steering Committee is only Rp5 million, plus allowances.'
With all due respect: yes. It is not a question of the amount, but the comparative figure. I was once a minister, a member of the DPR (House of Representatives), and Chair of the Constitutional Court. So I do know how much they all got. It was far greater than this.
I was a DPR member from 2004 to 2009, but quit in 2008 after moving to the Constitutional Court. Every month the salary paid directly into my account from the DPR was Rp48 million. Apart from that, for instance, for discussions on a law there was a Rp5 million allowance, constituents' funds of Rp46 million per quarter, house rental of Rp12.5 million a month. If I traveled overseas I received a business class ticket, five-star hotel accommodation, and pocket money of at least US$4,000 (equivalent to Rp55.5 million). If you add all that up, it could total Rp150 million a month.
The DPR was certainly the highest. I wasn't very aware of it while I was at the DPR, because all those amounts were paid through the bank. I never really checked. Once I was to become Chair of the Court (MK) I had to report my wealth to the Corruption Eradication Commission, right? I was shocked to see I had Rp4 billion in my account. I asked the DPR Secretariat-General to give me a breakdown. It all came from what I mentioned earlier: money for working visits, overseas trips on government business, and so on.
I don't know. It's up to others to say that. What I mean is that there should be a standard for setting salaries.

In this chapter, we provide an overview of recent advancements related to the safety assessment of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) using alternatives to animal testing strategies.
Advanced risk assessment computational procedures include new methods for characterizing and describing the complex structures of ENMs, development of computational models predicting adverse effects, extension of “read-across” approaches taking into account different aspects of ENM similarity, integration of various testing strategies using a “weight-of-evidence” approach, and using omics data and pathways analysis technologies to provide insights into ENM mechanisms that potentially could induce toxicity.
This episode we are joined first by Laura London who has a radio show devoted to exploring the works of Carl Jung and the Jungian method. She not only studied psychology at the University of Washington but is also a trained Remote Viewer. We begin by talking about how she initially got into Jung, she talks to us about the initial first steps she took in college and who she was before she really got into Jung. We then get into the idea of aliens and ghosts being internal vs. external where we learn that many of those into the paranormal have a false concept of what Jung’s work is actually like.
We are then joined by Bob Mitchell who is a UFO researcher/investigator/writer as well as an author of crime novels. We get into how Bob became interested in the abduction experience before getting into some of his stranger accounts. We talk to him about the Mantis beings, if they are good or evil. We discuss the Reptilians, the Grays and how the government is tied up in all of this. We ask Bob if he has ever had any fear of being targeted by negative alien groups or by the government.
This episode we are joined by the legendary Stewart Swerdlow who is possibly most famous for his involvement with the Montauk Project and more recently well known for speaking on Reptilians and Hollow Earth. We really get into it by learning how exactly it is possible to change realities and how the Reptilian sexual ritual magic can be used to ultimately move from one reality to the next. He fills us in on what exactly “Scorpion Programming is” to our amazement. Stewart tells us about the cover up of Hollow earth and how most people are programmed to not accept anything paranormal.
We finish off our show by talking to Chefist who has some notes to share about the Senda Monster. Many strange factoids are dropped which leave us wishing we could go back to talking about the Montauk Project..
We start off by taking a call from long time caller Frank From Las Vegas who calls to check in and ask about our opinions on Wrestlemania which prompts Daniel to give a quick review.
We are then joined by our first guest David M. Jacobs who is probably best known for being the author of the famous book “The Threat”. He talks to us how he initially became interested in UFO’s and how it got to the point where he has become one of the main investigators of UFO abduction. We talk a bit about communication between humans and aliens. David talks to us about how most alien abductions are negative and how the Mantis type beings seem to be at the top of the negative alien power structure. David makes it very clear that his studies into hypnotic regression have shown a definite pattern of negative alien interaction which follows family lines in order to keep it a secret.
We are then joined by our second guest Paul H. Smith who was part of the famous government remote viewing program. He talks to us about how he got started before then talking to us a bit about Ingo Swan who was his mentor. We ask Paul about intuition and then about other psychic powers such as telekinesis and telepathy. Paul talks to us about what is happening on the dark side of the moon. He then explains how both China and Russia both gave up their remote viewing programs around the same time and how he corresponds with the people who took part in those programs. He gives us a bit of a pointer how we can get started ourselves remote viewing.

We don’t we have enough people asking why ? Kids are usually shot down for asking too many questions, however I endorse it. Don’t shut a child down for asking questions just because it is getting on your nerve. It seems to me that this child wants to know the meaning of things.
If we had more people asking why, the world would be constantly changing for the better. Have you ever stopped to ask yourself why do we say the pledge of allegiance or why we does food spoil after a certain time ? Alot of questions that you may have just remains unanswered because we are doing the norm. Don’t settle for not knowing, take advantage of Google or Wikipedia. There are too many resources nowadays for us to learn about anything that our heart desires.

This poem is written by Henry Wotton. The man is happy who is born and educated. He is true to his words and honest in thoughts. He has no fear of death. He is not jealous. The flatterers cannot deceive him. The cruel persons cannot ruin him. He passes his day in the company of religious book or a good friend. He has no fear of ups and downs of life. He has nothing of his own but has everything. The truth is his only skill. He is not controlled by his passions. He is always ready to face the death. He is not slave of others. His conscience is his fort.
This poem is written by Cecil Alexander. The poet says that the God has made all the things. He has created great objects like mountains and small things like tiny birds. He has made beautiful flowers and singing birds. He has gifted us cold winter and pleasant summer. He has created the tall threes and the meadows where we play. He has given us eyes to see and lips to praise them. The Almighty God is great Who is the creator of all these things.
This poem is written by Ann Taylor. The poetess tells us that her mother looked after he when she was a little child. When she was sleeping in her cradle her mother watched her and she shed tears of love. She dressed her with beautiful clothes. She listened her attentively that she had to say. Whenever she fell, her mother came running to save her. She told her a good story and kissed her forehead to make her normal. She has determined to serve her, when she will grow old, feeble and weak.
In this poem, the poet teaches us a moral lesson about our thoughts and deeds. Our little words and little deeds have good or bad effects on others. A bad word or cruel look can break hearts in the same way as the mishandling can crush a budding flower. Therefore, we should speak gently. We should behave well with others.
This poem is written by T.W. Emerson. According to poet, no nation can aspire greatness on the basis of its material resources (wealth) only. It is the members of the nations whose efforts and hard work can lift the nation to the heights of glory provided they are truthful, self-respecting, steadfast, hardworking and can bear trial manfully. It is the men not wealth that makes a nation great and strong. Wealth does not make a nation great and powerful. A nation cannot be great without brave men.
This poem is written by H.W. Longfellow. He says us to get up. We are too late. The angels are knocking at our door. They are in a hurry. They have to go. If we go on taking rest we will lose our strength. We will become like a barren land where only weeds grow.

1 STATE OF MICHIGAN COURT OF APPEALS THE ARBORS CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION, UNPUBLISHED October 14, 2003 Plaintiff/Counterdefendant- Appellee, v No Oakland Circuit Court VICTORIA ABDELLA, LC No CH Defendant/Counterplaintiff- Appellant. Before: Kelly, P.J., and Cavanagh and Talbot, JJ. PER CURIAM. Plaintiff, The Arbors Condominium Association ( Arbors ), a Michigan non-profit condominium corporation, brought this action against defendant, a recorded co-owner of one of plaintiff s condominium units, to collect delinquent assessments and to seek foreclosure after plaintiff recorded two liens against defendant s condominium. Defendant counterclaimed, arguing that the late fees plaintiff charged and the liens filed against the property were illegal, and that the liens clouded her title to the property. Defendant appeals as of right from an order granting Arbors summary disposition and monetary judgment, and an order granting Arbors motion for summary disposition on defendant s counterclaim. We affirm. I Defendant s first issue on appeal is that the trial court erred in granting Arbors summary disposition because there was an issue of material fact regarding the amount she actually owed in delinquent condominium assessments. In support of this argument, defendant contends that Arbors wrongfully filed the first lien and, as a result, she was unable to refinance her home equity loan. Defendant argues that her inability to refinance her home equity loan caused her to default on the payment of the monthly assessment payments, ultimately leading to the filing of a second lien against her property and the instant legal proceedings. We disagree. Arbors motion for summary disposition was brought pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(9) and MCR 2.116(C)(10). Although the trial court did not state the particular subrule under which it decided the summary disposition motion, it is clear that the court relied on proofs outside the pleadings in reaching its decision. Accordingly, this issue will be reviewed under MCR -1-
2 2.116(C)(10). Kubisz v Cadillac Gage Textron, Inc, 236 Mich App 629, 633 n 4; 601 NW2d 160 (1999). We review a trial court s decision to grant a motion for summary disposition de novo. Spiek v Dep t of Transportation, 456 Mich 331, 337; 572 NW2d 201 (1998). When reviewing a motion granted under MCR 2.116(C)(10), this Court must examine all relevant documentary evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and determine whether there exists a genuine issue of material fact on which reasonable minds could differ. Progressive Timberlands, Inc v R & R Heavy Haulers, Inc, 243 Mich App 404, 407; 622 NW2d 533 (2000). The nonmovant may not rest upon mere allegations or denials in the pleadings, but must, by documentary evidence, set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Quinto v Cross & Peters Co, 451 Mich 358, 362; 547 NW2d 314 (1996). MCL requires each condominium unit owner to comply with the project s master deed, bylaws, and the rules and regulations found in and promulgated under the Condominium Act. The lien recorded against defendant s property on March 15, 2000, provided that through March 1, 2000, defendant owed $ in unpaid assessments, exclusive of interest, late charges, costs and attorney fees.... However, the record indicates that the outstanding balance of $ included late charges and costs. Thus, defendant correctly points out that she only owed $95 in delinquent assessments only. The determination of the outstanding balance for purposes of filing the lien was based on MCL (1), which provides, in pertinent part: Sums assessed to a co-owner by the association of co-owners that are unpaid together with interest on such sums, collection and late charges, advances made by the association of co-owners for taxes or other liens to protect its lien, attorney fees, and fines in accordance with the condominium documents, constitute a lien upon the unit or units in the project owned by the co-owner at the time of the assessment.... [Emphasis added.] According to the statute, not only the unpaid assessments, but also any collection and late charges that have accrued to date, constitute a lien on the defaulting co-owner s property. Therefore, the statement in the lien providing that defendant had an outstanding balance of $ was accurate. The only inaccuracy was the statement that the outstanding balance excluded interest, late charges and other costs. MCL (1) does not require that a co-owner owe a certain amount in unpaid assessments before a lien on her property attaches, but rather, it provides that any unpaid assessments constitute a lien on the property. Given that it is clear from both the documentary evidence in the record and defendant s own admission that she was delinquent in her assessment payments at the time the first lien was filed, we conclude that the filing of that lien was not improper. We find unpersuasive defendant s argument that Arbors violated its own bylaws by filing the first lien. Defendant contends that Arbors acted contrary to its own bylaws because defendant was not two months in arrears at that time. The record indicates that during its August 18, 1999, meeting, plaintiff s board of directors decided that the process of filing a lien would take place routinely after a two month delinquency. As previously discussed, MCL (1) provides that any unpaid assessment constitutes a lien. A condo association is authorized to record the lien, which is a prerequisite to commencing foreclosure proceedings, MCL -2-
3 (3), as soon as a co-owner becomes delinquent in her payments. Arbors bylaws provide that the statute prevails in the event of a conflict between the bylaws and the provisions of the condominium act. Thus, Arbors was not obligated to wait until defendant was two months delinquent before filing the lien. Further, and contrary to defendant s claim, Arbors properly complied with is two-month delinquency rule. Defendant did not pay her monthly assessments for the months of January or February of 2000, resulting in a payment delinquency of over two months by the time the lien was placed in March. Although defendant made a $500 under protest payment on March 3, 2000, this payment was insufficient to satisfy the entire amount due. As the trial court concluded, Arbors two-month delinquency rule merely provided that Arbors will commence the process of filing a lien against a co-owner s property when a co-owner has failed to fully satisfy an outstanding balance for two consecutive months. Because defendant failed to pay the outstanding balance for the months of January through March 15, 2000, Arbors properly followed its two-month delinquency rule in filing the first lien against defendant s property. We also find without merit defendant s argument that the filing of the first lien prevented the refinancing of her home equity loan and put her in further financial difficulty. The record shows that, a few months after the first lien was filed, defendant made a $2,000 payment, satisfying her payment obligations and leaving her with a credit. In response, Arbors notified defendant that it would discharge the first lien upon receipt of the recorded lien from the Oakland County Register of Deeds. Arbors explained in a letter to defendant that it would take about seven to eight months before Arbors received the recorded lien. Arbors was careful to inform defendant that if she needed to refinance during that time, she should have the mortgage company contact Arbors lawyer who would provide the necessary documentation for the refinancing process. On this record, defendant has presented no evidence indicating that she ever attempted to refinance her home equity loan while the first lien was in place or that any such attempt was unsuccessful because of the lien s existence. Given the above, we conclude that the granting of Arbors motion for summary disposition in was proper. Defendant next argues that the trial court improperly granted Arbors motion for summary disposition on defendant s counterclaim that raised a claim of slander of title. Specifically, defendant contends that the motion should not have been granted when Arbors maliciously and wrongfully filed the first lien against the property. We disagree. In granting the motion, the court expressly ruled that defendant failed to state any claim upon which relief could be granted. A motion under MCR 2.116(C)(8) tests the legal sufficiency of a claim by the pleadings alone; the motion may not be supported with documentary evidence. Beaudrie v Henderson, 465 Mich 124, 129; 631 NW2d 308 (2001). A motion under MCR 2.116(C)(8) tests the legal sufficiency of the complaint. All well-pleaded factual allegations are accepted as true and construed in a light most favorable to the nonmovant. Maiden v Rozwood, 461 Mich 109, 119; 597 NW2d 817 (1999). Defendant s counter-complaint consisted of all of four short sentences in which she alleged that (1) the $20 late fee charged by Arbors was a penalty and contrary to the bylaws and Michigan law; (2) Arbors improperly placed the first lien on defendant s property; (3) Arbors failed, neglected or refused to have the first lien removed and it took several months to do so; and (4) the first lien was an improper cloud of defendant s title. -3-
4 As will be further discussed in this opinion, the $20 monthly late fees were not penalties and were not in violation of plaintiff s bylaws or Michigan law. Therefore, the first paragraph in the counterclaim is without merit. As to the fourth paragraph in the counterclaim, to establish slander of title, a plaintiff must show falsity, malice, and special damages in that the defendant maliciously published false statements that disparaged a plaintiff's right in property, causing special damages. B & B Investment Group v Gitler, 229 Mich App 1, 8; 581 NW2d 17 (1998). Special damages include litigation costs and impairment of vendibility. Id. at 9. A plaintiff must show that a defendant knowingly filed an invalid lien with the intent to cause the plaintiff injury. Stanton v Dachille, 186 Mich App 247, 262; 463 NW2d 479 (1990). Here, there is nothing in defendant s pleadings indicating that Arbors acted with malice in filing the lien. Defendant, therefore, failed to establish that the first lien improperly clouded her title. Thus, the court correctly concluded that defendant had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted and it properly granted Arbors motion for summary disposition on the counterclaim. II Defendant next argues that trial court erred in upholding the late fees that Arbors imposed on her. Specifically, defendant asserts that the fees were impermissible penalties and not liquidated damages, contrary to Michigan law and public policy. We disagree. Whether a liquidated damages provision is valid and enforceable or invalid as a penalty is a question of law which this Court reviews de novo. UAW-GM Human Resource Center v KSL Recreation Corp, 228 Mich App 486, 508; 579 NW2d 411 (1998), citing Moore v St Clair Co, 120 Mich App 335, 339; 328 NW2d 47 (1982). The courts are to sustain such provisions if the amount is "reasonable with relation to the possible injury suffered" and not "unconscionable or excessive." Moore, supra at 340, quoting Curran v Williams, 352 Mich 278, 282; 89 NW2d 602 (1958). On June 16, 1999, Arbors board of directors enacted a rule providing that, effective August 1, 1999, co-owners who failed to make timely maintenance payments would receive a written notice after seven days. If the payments were not made by the tenth day, a late fee of $20 would be assessed. Arbors bylaws provide that the board of directors has the authority to enact such rules without the consent of co-owners. On October 15, 1999, Arbors began charging defendant a $20 late fee per month for her unpaid assessments. As part of the monetary judgment entered in favor of Arbors, the trial court ordered defendant to pay all of the late fees that had accrued as of the date of commencement of the proceeding in this case. Defendant argues that Arbors should only charge a seven percent late fee, and that any damages not compensated for by such interest should be reasonably calculated according to what Arbors would have earned if it had promptly deposited the money into an interest-bearing account. We disagree. Because Arbors is a non-profit organization and is not in the business of investing money for profit, defendant s method of calculating plaintiff's damages is improper. In order for the late fees to be liquidated damages, the damages must be uncertain and the late fees must closely approximate the damages. E F Solomon v Dep't of State Highways & Transportation, 131 Mich App 479, ; 345 NW2d 717 (1984). The record shows that, while the amount of Arbors damages were uncertain, the $20 per month late fee was a reasonable estimation of the damages it suffered, especially considering the inconvenience of a -4-
5 late payment would cost administratively and for the steps that necessarily have to be taken to enforce the payment, such as extra bookkeeping and sending account statements and overdue bill notifications. Thus, we conclude the late fees were not penalties, but liquidated damages that were both valid and reasonable. Therefore, the trial court did not err in upholding the late fees. We also find defendant s argument that the late fees are usurious to be without merit. The usury statute, MCL , which establishes the legal interest rate that may be charged, is not applicable to a liquidated damages clause. Interest is "a charge for the loan or forbearance of money." Balch v Detroit Trust Co, 312 Mich 146, 152; 20 NW2d 138 (1945). A liquidated damages clause is not a charge for the loan or forbearance of money, but rather, is a charge to cover actual expenses engendered by a breach of contract. III Defendant next argues that the trial court improperly awarded Arbors post-order attorney fees. Specifically, defendant asserts that Arbors counsel had failed to provide an itemized explanation of the hours and nature of the work performed after the August 29, 2001, order was entered. Defendant also asserts that during the evidentiary hearing, the court became impatient and simply guessed on an appropriate amount of attorney fees to award and, as a result, defendant did not receive the evidentiary hearing to which she was entitled. We disagree. This Court reviews the trial court s award of attorney fees for an abuse of discretion. Joerger v Gordon Food Service, Inc, 224 Mich App 167, ; 568 NW2d 365 (1997). The Condominium Act was recently amended 1 to make the recovery of costs and attorney fees mandatory. MCL (b) provides: In a proceeding arising because of an alleged default by a co-owner, the association of co-owners or the co-owner, if successful, shall recover the costs of the proceeding and reasonable attorney fees, as determined by the court, to the extent the condominium documents expressly so provide. Arbors bylaws expressly provide that in a default proceeding, Arbors, if successful, shall be entitled to recover the costs of the proceedings and reasonable attorney fees determined by the court. In addition, in its August 29, 2001, order granting Arbors motion for summary disposition, the trial court ordered that [d]efendant shall be, and hereby is, obligated to pay all additional legal fees that Plaintiff Association reasonably incurs in attempting to collect the aforementioned sums and owing it throughout.... Thus, under MCL (b), Arbors bylaws, and the court s order, Arbors was entitled to recover reasonable attorney fees related to collection of judgment in the instant case. The record indicates that on December 5, 2001, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing to determine the reasonable amount of attorney fees Arbors should be awarded. At that hearing, 1 This statute was amended effective January 1, The amendments to MCL (b) do not affect our analysis. -5-
6 Lloyd Turner, the treasurer of plaintiff s board of directors, testified that on September 18, 2001, Arbors paid $580 in legal fees for representation related to its motion for summary disposition that was heard in August of This amount was not included in the $1, in attorney s fees awarded to Arbors in the August 29, 2001, order. There was also evidence presented that on October 11, 2001, Arbors paid an additional $ in attorney fees for legal services rendered during September of 2001 in relation to the collection of the judgment in the instant case. Upon hearing the testimony and reviewing the billing statements provided by Arbors, the court held that, in addition to the $1, in attorney fees that was awarded, Arbors was entitled to an additional $ ($580 plus $362.50) in attorney fees for legal services rendered in attempting to collect judgment since entry of the August 29, 2001, order, and thus, the total amount in attorney fees owed to Arbors was $2, The court found that when the total was divided by Arbors counsel s hourly rate of $145, it equaled approximately 15 ½ hours, which the court believed was a very reasonable fee at a very low rate, especially in light of defense counsel s admission that even he had put in more than fifteen hours of work on the instant case. From our review of the record, we conclude that the court s award of additional attorney fees was not randomly determined, but was reasonably based on testimonial and documentary evidence presented at the hearing regarding the amount Arbors had paid in legal fees since entry of the earlier order. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding additional attorney fees. Defendant is not entitled to another evidentiary hearing. Affirmed. /s/ Kirsten Frank Kelly /s/ Mark J.

1 Punctuation in Academic Writing Academic punctuation presentation/ Defining your terms practice Choose one of the things below and work together to describe its form and uses in as much detail as possible, including contrasting with other things. (Round) brackets Apostrophe Bold Bullet points Capital letters Colon Comma Dash Dot dot dot Emoticons (smileys, etc) Exclamation mark Forward slash Full stop Hyphen Indent Italics Numbering Question mark Quotation marks Semicolon Square brackets In contrast whereas unlike Contrasting According to If we take as an example Generalising from this example, Useful language Giving additional information In addition We should also perhaps add A related use is Other useful language Ask your teacher about any which you aren t sure of, especially any differences. Match up the pieces of paper your teacher gives you to make explanations of some of the things above. AND/ OR Write the names of some of the things above in descriptions that you are given. Check your answers, then ask your teacher about any you still aren t sure about. Answer the comprehension questions from memory, then look for the answers in the texts.
2 Answer the Questions about Punctuation in Academic Writing What kinds of words are not capitalised in titles? What linking words are usually followed by a comma? What s the difference between semicolons and commas with lists? What kind of brackets are most likely with the expression sic (used to show that there is a mistake in the quoted text)? Why might a writer join what could be two sentences with a semicolon instead? What changes might be needed to the sentences to make that possible? Is that recommended by the text? Give examples of things which are usually in brackets rather than between paired commas. How do you know whether something should be in brackets or paired commas, rather than just forming part of the flow of the sentence? What punctuation is similar to a dash? Which are preferred in academic writing? Try to answer the questions about the other punctuation. How can you divide up information in a list introduced with a colon? What are the differences between single and double quotation marks? How can you know which ones to use? Are contractions with apostrophes acceptable in academic writing? Apart from actual quoting, what can quotation marks be used for in academic writing?
3 1. As well as the obvious uses (starting sentences, days of the week, months, proper nouns, etc), are used at the beginning of the main words of names of things such as books and articles. By main words, we mean not grammar words like determiners ( a, an, the, etc), prepositions (words like to, of and for ) or conjunctions (such as and and but ), unless they are the first word in the title. It is sometimes confusing whether something should be considered the name of something or simply a description. For example, Central London would mean following the official description of that (zones and two), whereas central London would be a more general or personal definition. 2. A signals a break in the flow of the sentence, including separate[ing] extra information from the main idea of the sentence, separate[ing] linking words from the main idea of the sentence [and] resolv[ing] ambiguity. [1] Examples of linking words and phrases which are usually followed by a include furthermore, however, similarly, again, therefore, consequently, in conclusion and finally. s are also used to divide up lists, with semicolons being used for lists where each item is more complicated.
4 3. To quote wholesale from The Chicago Manual of Style 16 th Edition: (in the United States usually just called brackets) are used in scholarly prose mainly to enclose material usually added by someone other than the original writer that does not form a part of the surrounding text. Specifically, [ ] enclose editorial interpolations, explanations, translations of foreign terms, or corrections. They can also be used surrounding three dots to show parts of the text which were edited out, as in the quote given above. To avoid round brackets within round brackets, the inner ones can also be replaced with. 4. The online Macmillan dictionary defines a as a punctuation mark [ ] that is used to separate words in a list, or two parts of a sentence that can be understood separately (retrieved from 10 May 2013), but the first part of the definition could easily refer to a comma. The difference in this case is that s are used for more complex lists, often ones introduced with a colon, and perhaps even ones with commas within the items on the list (although this can be confusing and is not usually good style). The second use given by the Macmillan dictionary is more similar to that of a full stop, but emphasising the connection or similarity between the two clauses more than a full stop would and perhaps replacing a linking word. This use is difficult even for native speakers and so is best avoided.
5 5. According to the Macmillan dictionary website, (or parenthesis in American English) are used in writing or mathematics for showing that the piece of information or set of numbers between them can be considered separately. However, this is also true of paired commas. We therefore need to be more precise, adding that are generally used for information which is more complex or further from the main topic of the sentence than information between paired commas usually is. This tends to include examples and references to other parts of the page, such as (see below) and (Fig. 2.3). In academic writing they are also of course used in referencing, enclosing the year of publication, or author and year of publication. As with paired commas, the general rule for information in brackets is that you should be understand the sentence even with those words removed. 6 A should not be confused with a hyphen, which is shorter and is usually used between words. A has similar functions to brackets or paired commas (dividing extra information from the rest of the sentence) and one of the functions of a semicolon (connecting two clauses, often replacing a linking word, in a way which shows a closer connection that two sentences would). In general, though, other punctuation marks like those just mentioned are preferred to dashes in academic writing.
6 Put the punctuation back into the examples Capital letters as well as the obvious uses starting sentences days of the week months proper nouns etc capital letters are used at the beginning of the main words of names of things such as books and articles by main words we mean not grammar words like determiners a an the etc prepositions words like to of and for or conjunctions such as and and but unless they are the first word in the title it is sometimes confusing whether something should be considered the name of something or simply a description for example central london would mean following the official description of that zones and two whereas central London would be a more general or personal definition Colon the online macmillan dictionary gives examples of the use of a colon as before an explanation or list retrieved 12 May 2013 the oxford advanced learners dictionary 5 th ed 1995 also mentions an example a summary of what precedes it or a contrasting idea and to this we can add the more common academic situations of long and complex lists usually presented with numbers or bullet points or divided by semicolons Square brackets to quote wholesale from the chicago manual of style 16 th edition square brackets in the united States usually just called brackets are used in scholarly prose mainly to enclose material usually added by someone other than the original writer that does not form a part of the surrounding text specifically square brackets enclose editorial interpolations explanations translations of foreign terms or corrections they can also be used surrounding three dots to show parts of the text which were edited out as in the quote given above
7 Complete the defining your terms phrases Put one word into each of the gaps below, from your memory or own ideas Capital letters As well the obvious uses (starting sentences, days of the week, months, proper nouns, etc), capital letters are used at the beginning of the main words of names of things such as books and articles. main words, we mean not grammar words like determiners ( a, an, the, etc), prepositions (words like to, of and for ) or conjunctions (such as and and but ), they are the first word in the title. It is sometimes confusing something should be considered the name of something or simply a description. For example, Central London mean following the official description of that (zones and two), whereas central London would be a more general or personal definition. Colon The online Macmillan Dictionary examples of the use of a colon as before an explanation or list. The Oxford Advanced Learner s Dictionary (5 th Ed., 1995) also an example, a [ ] summary of what precedes it, or a contrasting idea, and this we can add the more common academic situations of long and complex lists. Semicolon The online Macmillan dictionary defines a semicolon a punctuation mark [ ] that is used to separate words in a list, or two parts of a sentence that can be understood separately (retrieved 10 May 2013), but the first part of the definition could easily refer a comma. The difference this case is that semicolons are used for more complex lists. (Round) brackets According to the Macmillan dictionary website, round brackets ( parenthesis in American English) are used writing or mathematics for showing that the piece of information or set of numbers between them can be considered separately. However, this is true of paired commas. We therefore need to be precise, adding round brackets are generally used for information which is more complex or further from the main topic of the sentence. Dash A dash should not be confused a hyphen, which is shorter and is usually used between words. A dash has similar functions brackets or paired commas (dividing extra information from the rest of the sentence) and one of the functions of a semicolon (connecting two clauses, often replacing a linking word, in a way which shows a closer connection that two sentences would). general, though, other punctuation marks like those just mentioned are preferred to dashes in academic writing. Check with the original texts. Many other answers are possible, so please check with your teacher before changing the words that you put.

We can say that Israel today is facing a unique opportunity as a result of regional events. Wasting a chance that provides Israel with common interests in the region cannot be forgiven. There are a series of steps within Israel’s reach that enable it to play a regional role to establish its position for generations to come. The indifference by Israeli decision-makers to exploit available opportunities in the region is hard to understand. The crumbling colonial borders in Iraq and Syria and the possibility of establishing a Kurdish state provides Israel with a real opportunity to cooperate with moderate Arab states in facing extreme organizations because Israel has a security and economic power which it can employ to serve regional security. On the other hand, the growing threats by radical Islam in the Middle East have forced most Arab countries to look for stability. The resolve of moderate Arab states has made a bulwark against the extreme religious threat. These countries also realize the need to confront religious violence, which poses a threat for demarcation and stable countries in the region. Israel’s participation to find stability in the region will increase its revenues, open new markets for its goods and meet the Israeli youth’s desire in a welfare state with equal rights. Therefore, Israel’s need to bolster its military, information, security and economic capabilities in the region is an existential one based on common strategic interests. But how did Israeli authorities respond to this opportunity? They are responding by building more settlements, enacting undemocratic laws, turning their backs to the West and the regional opportunity for cooperation with moderate Arab states! Despite the available opportunities for Israel to engage and build confidence with countries in the region, it seems that the message conveyed to the chiefs of the five powerful agencies in Israel - the army, the Shin Bet, the Mossad, the Police and the judiciary – is no to taking the initiative and action in the region. The majority of former security officials do not understand how can Israel hide behind building settlements and stand helpless in front of the opportunity of the century. The dynamic of time is so important. American President Barack Obama once considered Recep Tayyip Erdogan one of the closest five leaders in the world. After sometime Erdogan, however, revealed his extremism and the Americans moved to cooperate with his Kurdish enemies. This dynamic provides Israel with a big opportunity today. Israel, however, is cornered and Israeli Premier Benyamin Netanyahu is utilizing the regional desire to cooperate with Israel to boost settlements and racism. Because there is no one to pressure him in the region now, which means that wasting the available opportunity is a huge loss. Source:By Sefi Rachlevsky

Thanksgiving is upon us and so is the yearly conundrum: what, as educators, do we say and do surrounding Thanksgiving? In this episode, we unpack our own experiences learning and teaching the lie of the “First Thanksgiving” and the mindset shift we both engaged in so that we could begin revealing the truth.
It’s important to note that neither of us grew up knowing the truth about Thanksgiving; we both experienced the “traditional” white-washed teaching of the “First Thanksgiving.” It required a lot of self-directed learning on the topic to get to where we are now… which is the case for SO many educators. There are many adults, teachers even, that still don’t know that the “First Thanksgiving” is a falsehood. It’s our job to do better when we know better and to help others do the same.
“Righting a wrong” isn’t the only reason to stop teaching the lie of the “First Thanksgiving.” There are so many reasons – to create space and hear the narratives of marginalized peoples in our historical record, to ensure that we’re allowing our learners opportunities for critical discourse, and to honor the humanity and dignity of indigeous peoples in America today.
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie gave an incredible TED Talk on the danger of a single story. This applies to so much of our discourse – written, oral, recorded – but I’m particularly struck by it in terms of how history is presented to learners.
This post, from Jessica Lifshitz, is an incredible resource for teaching beyond the single story. We strongly encourage you not only to read and use this piece, but to follow Jess on Twitter: @Jess5th.

Leverage local resources and use this time as an opportunity to honor and teach about local tribes (November is, in fact, Native American History Month). The National Congress of American Indians has a database that can be utilized to find tribes local to your area.
Use the correct terminology with your learners and conversations surrounding that as a springboard for further exploration of history. This article is a great place to start exploring the language-aspect of this conversation.
Teach about thankfulness as a general practice rather than emphasizing the lie of the “First Thanksgiving.” Tamara has created an entire unit on thankfulness, which you can find here.
Utilize visuals – such as paintings like “The First Thanksgiving” – to discuss bias, historically and in modern representations of history. Ask the curious, open-ended questions that lead to learners comparing and contrasting the positioning/perspectives in the visuals. (Example: “What do you notice about the body language of the pilgrims vs. the Native Americans?”) Beyond the Bubble offers many great options, including this activity on “The First Thanksgiving.”
Use primary and secondary sources and allow students to analyze them in contrast to modern texts and representations of the time. The Library of Congress offers a free teacher’s guide and resource set for just such an exploration of Thanksgiving, past and present.
Culminate your study with a high engagement activity like the one Tamara details here, the activity she shares in this episode. Learners are able to work collaboratively, which not only increases their overall engagement but allows for differing perspectives.
Use tradebooks, such as “Encounter” by Jane Yolen (affiliate link), to present students with multiple perspectives of a time-period. While “Encounter” tells the story of Columbus’s arrival to San Salvador from the perspective of a Taino boy, it’s a good entry point for discussions of perspective surrounding “The First Thanksgiving.”
Social media is a virtually inescapable part of our society. Social media’s impact on teaching has been complicated, and has, in some ways, led us away from conversations about best practices. In this episode, we unpack the role of social media and best practices in teaching, and discuss why best practice is never a dirty word.
Equity in education covers so many facets of our learners and our educational system. Everyone has a niche – something that they’re passionate about within their role as an educator. Every niche has issues of equity that must be address. Start there. Live there. Be passionate about equity within your niche.
Our practice as teachers is the centerpiece of our life’s work; we’re passionate about what we do and why. But we must – MUST – be willing to have conversations about what’s best for students and be willing to be reflective about our wants versus students’ learning needs. Conversations about best practices have to be an integral part of our spaces.
Whether we like it or not, most of us are influenced by what we consume on social media. If, in your education spaces, you are following only accounts that show you the beautifully curated “window-dressing” of teaching you run the risk of burning yourself out trying to achieve it and watering down your practice in the process. We owe it to ourselves to cultivate a well-balanced diet on social media: following those that are where we are, being a model – and a hand – to those that want to be where we are, and following those that inspire us and reinvigorate our practice. Following a diet of “candy bar” window-dressing will leave us filling full for a moment, but empty over time.

True friendship is so rare yet so necessary in the work of educational equity. For one, equity can often be a heavy topic. It can be difficult to exist in that heaviness without someone that gets you and understands where your perspective is and where you’re coming from. There’s no end-point to this work toward equity. This is a marathon, not a sprint.
When you’re living in that head-space… you need someone that’s going to sustain you, not someone that’s going to make you feel good for a couple of minutes and then you’re left living this and doing this work all on your own. It’s an awesome thing to be able to connect with people – whether it’s at your school site or online (like we did). It’s necessary in this work because it’s hard and can get gritty… and you do need someone that’s got your back.
What we did on this episode is interview one another so that you can get to know the women behind Equi-TEA, as well as a little bit more about why we’re so passionate about this work. We hope you’ll enjoy getting to know us – please connect with us in the comments to tell us a little about you!
Equi-TEA is a collective project, developed by two friends and educators, focused on issues of equity facing education today.
Questioning what constitutes the characteristics of ecologically responsible architecture, may not now seem like such an extraordinary pursuit. Yet in 1970's when a young Malaysian born architectural student called Ken Yeang asked the question it was considered quite radical.
Ken Yeang studied architecture at the Architectural Association (AA) in London, an institution with a tradition of radical thinking. It was here that he first began to question architectures role within the context of a growing concern for the environment, energy and sustainability.
In 1971 Ken Yeang became one of the first architects to undertake a PhD on the subject of ecological design. He enrolled in the doctoral programme in the Department of Architecture at Cambridge University. His dissertation submitted in 1974 was entitled ‘A Theoretical Framework for the Incorporation of Ecological Considerations in the Design and Planning of the Built Environment'. After suffering some delays he was awarded his PhD in 1981 and his dissertation was later published in 1995 under the title ‘Designing With Nature: The Ecological Basis for Architectural Design'.
‘It is easy to be misled or seduced by technology and to think that if we assemble enough eco-gadgetry in the form of solar collectors, photovoltaic cells, biological recycling systems, building automation systems and double skin facades in one single building this can automatically be considered ecological architecture...to be fully effective, these technologies need to be thoroughly integrated into the building fabric; they will also be influenced by the physical and climatic conditions of the site. The nature of the problem is therefore site specific. There will never be a standard "one size fits all" solution.'
This statement seems to encapsulate Dr Yeang's lifelong dedication to developing an architectural design approach that goes beyond ‘greenwashing' and ‘tick boxing' certification systems. His ultimate goal has always been the creation of ‘benign' built forms that compliment and work within the planet's delicate biosystems.
Back in Malaysia, in his own architectural practice, begun in mid 1970's with Tengku Robert Hamzah, Dr Yeang started applying his sustainable design methodology to both real world, theoretical writing, and competition projects. Three main forces initially drove this methodology.
The first was climatic. That buildings should be designed to optimise the ambient conditions within spaces and this would ultimately result in new building forms that are specific to their locations. The second was cultural. That architecture needs to respond to the local conditions of life. The third was aspirational and driven by the desire of countries within the tropical zones to join the ‘developed' world, requiring a change from traditional low-rise structures to a modern high-rise strategy.
These three methodologies culminated in the development of the bioclimatic skyscraper, for which Ken Yeang has become most famous. He proposed an approach to tall buildings that respond to the climatic conditions of their site. Often incorporating the integration of vegetation and vertical gardens, use of skycourts, natural ventilation and the influence of solar geometry to achieve self-shading structures.
Yeang's development of ideas for a climate-generated architecture, radically changed preconceptions about appropriate forms for high-rise and urban planning. Many of the ecologically sustainable buildings being developed today, owe their design principles to the methodology Ken Yeang developed almost forty years ago.
He continues to apply his principles of ecoarchitecture today in his practice T. R. Hamzah and Yeang and it's sister offices in the UK as Llewelyn Davies Yeang and in China as North Hamzah Yeang Architectural and Engineering Company (Beijing).

This quick and fool proof recipe for Blondies has become my go-to hostess gift this summer. Very few people are able resist these buttery bite-sized squares especially as every last nibble is heavily filled with creamy chocolate and crunchy nuts. I also loved that I learned a new-to-me trick from Cooks Illustrated which detailed how to line the baking dish with foil so that you can easily extract baked goods from the pan and then slice them into neat and tidy squares. You know how much I love everything to be orderly.
Another great item to have on hand for making more aesthetically pleasing treats is a baking pan with straight edges. You can obviously use a traditional curved edge oblong Pyrex but it’s so much nicer to have a pan that will yield a crisp and clean perimeter.
One last suggestion. Whatever you do, please don’t ever buy those horrible white chocolate chips sold by the bagful. They are cloyingly sweet and taste just awful. I always find that it’s best to chop up a good quality white chocolate bar when a recipe calls for the addition of white chocolate chips. Trust me. There is a huge difference in flavor.
A note from Cooks Illustrated: Be very careful not to overbake the blondies; they dry out easily and will turn hard. Start checking the oven a couple of minutes before they will be done.
Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread nuts on large rimmed baking sheet and bake until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer nuts to cutting board to cool; chop coarsely and set aside.
While nuts toast, cut 18-inch length foil and fold lengthwise to 8-inch width. Fit foil into length of 13 by 9-inch baking pan, pushing it into corners and up sides of pan; allow excess to overhang pan edges. Cut 14-inch length foil and fit into width of baking pan in same manner, perpendicular to first sheet (if using extra-wide foil, fold second sheet lengthwise to 12-inch width). Spray foil-lined pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Whisk melted butter and brown sugar together in medium bowl until combined. Add eggs and vanilla and mix well. Using rubber spatula, fold dry ingredients into egg mixture until just combined; do not overmix. Fold in chocolate and nuts and turn batter into prepared pan, smoothing top with rubber spatula.
Bake until top is shiny, cracked, and light golden brown, 22 to 25 minutes; do not overbake. Cool on wire rack to room temperature. Remove bars from pan by lifting foil overhang and transfer to cutting board. Cut into 2-inch squares and serve.
Foil in the pan? So simple. Perfect and makes me feel a little more confident about attacking another brownie recipe. That’s the most difficult part to me, getting them out of the pan!
And the white chocolate chips, I’ve thought the very same thing but never thought about a substitute.
Beautiful! the foil trick works great, doesn’t it? I really love the pans with square corners, but do I own any? No.
I figured out the foil in the pan thing after making fudge and lining the pan with wax paper. Same idea. I adore blondies. I prefer them without nuts but take what I can get. I’m blondie-easy that way. And the square pans are nice for a clean edge – I just hate trying to clean the corners. Gorgeous looking treats, Erin!
What symmetrical blondies! I agree on using the white chocolate bar. White chips aren’t usually even made with cocoa butter, that’s why they’re labeled something like “white morsels” – they’re not allowed to call it chocolate because there’s no chocolate in there!
You have some lovely blondies on your hands! I agree about white chocolate chips…the worst is when you try and melt them. These look amazing and definitely a great go-to recipe.
Also? could not agree more about the white chips/chunked bar. I’m not a HUGE fan of white chocolate, but when I do make something that has it in it, I go straight to the bar.
(funny… I used to go straight to the bar before I got into baking, too. but those were different times, and very different bars.)
And is is bad that I’m a little smug that I’ve been doing the foil in the pan trick forever for my brownies? I can’t believe I knew a slick cooking trick that you didn’t already utilize! 😉
Those look wicked good. Man, I wish my girlfriend liked blondies. But she doesn’t, so I can’t really make them. I mean I could, but then I would eat them all by myself. And get sick. Not to mention fat. Heh.
I was thinking about making seven layer bars for a BBQ this weekend, but now I’m reconsidering. The Blondies are a personal favorite and these look delicious!
Good idea on chopping up the chocolate! My husband loves white chocolate, but even he doesn’t like those gross chips.
I am invited to a picnic birthday party Saturday and these sounds like a great thing to bring. Thank you!
And, yes, I do agree about the white chocolate chips, but same on the semi sweet chocolate, unless you buy top notch, you are better off chopping a bar.
I do the same with parchment paper because getting bars out of the sqaured off pans is nearly impossible!
This is a good one, though I will probably save it for fall / winter. The idea of the over on for more than 15 minutes is too much for me in the NY summer hot & sticky weather 🙂
bookmarked!! i have my go to recipe for blondies but these look so beautiful that i must give them a try 🙂
I have never had a blondie before but I have heard PLENTY about them. I’m intrigued. I think I should rummage around my pantry to see if I have all the ingredients. 🙂
I always thing of Blondies as a bake sale staple. I am feeling a bit homesick so I might have to make a batch to bring in as a post-lunch snack at work.
I have never even thought of lining my brownie pans…and I don’t know why, considering I make them all the time.
love the foil in the pan idea, and i’m with you on the white chips. i adore green and black’s white choc! the pan? well, i’ll have to hold off on that one… until i get better funded 😉
If you live in SF, CA … Try the white chocolate blocks in the bulk section at Rainbow Grocery. I admit that I like white chocolate … Well I like ALL chocolate. These blocks are the best tasting white chocolate I have encountered. Plus, you can purchase exactly how much you need.
I totally agree with you on the white chocolate! I’m in love with Chris Kimball of Cook’s Illustrated and think blondies are amazing, so I might just have to try these 🙂
These Blondies look awesome and appear (short of actually baking a pan right now) to be THE Blondies that I knew and loved at Just Desserts store fronts in San Francisco back in the 80’s. I have never come across those Blondies in all these years, even though my wife (who linked me to this site) has tried over and over to reproduce the Just Desserts version.
Ok..I see where I went wrong the first time. My baking powder was from 2003 (cringe) and I creamed the butter and sugar instead of melting it..being a rebel isn’t always a good thing.
I agree – these are fabulous! I made them today from The America’s Test Kitchen Family Cookbook, where they were republished, and my GOD are these good!!! I made four recipes side-by-side that I’d loved in the past (Ben & Jerry’s Dessert Book, The Mixer Bible, and the Cook’s Country reduced fat-version (new to me)), and this was the clear winner, and just fabulous. I love the addition of white chocolate chips (I use the Cook’s Illustrated recommended Guittard Choc-au-lait white chocolate chips which are really good, which my Cost Plus World Market carries and I’ve also bought on Amazon), because they are not only delicious, but they don’t cover up the base flavor of the blondie like semisweet chocolate chips do (those are delicious in the ratio in this recipe, though). I love Cook’s Illustrated, America’s Test Kitchen, and Cook’s Country. And I LOVE this blondie recipe!!!

This paper uses methods based on corpus statistics and synonymy to explore the role language history and sound/form relationships play in conceptual organization through a case study relating the phonaestheme gl- to its prevalent Proto-Indo European root, *ghel. The results of both methods point to a strong link between the phonaestheme and the historical root, suggesting that the lineage of a language plays an important role in the distribution of linguistic meaning. The implications of these findings are discussed.
Good evening Kovacsians. When Edie Adams passed away last week I sent an email to our good friend Jack Phillippe, who grew up in Philadelphia and as a young man was a guest on a January 1952 episode of "Kovacs On The Corner."
Hearing of Edie's passing made Jack reminisce about growing up in Philly during the 1950's and watching the great television shows of that time. He wanted to share some artifacts from his collection with all of us and has been gracious enough to take the time to send me some scans.
The first is of an EEFMS card; it's an original from Ernie's very first show on WPTZ Channel Three, NBC in Philadelphia, "3 To Get Ready." Jack sent this once before and I posted it, but this time its a bit bigger and clearer. Enjoy:
One staple of Philadelphia televison in the 1950s was Officer Pete Boyle, played by that icon of Philadelphia Kids' TV Peter Boyle Sr.. Pete Sr. was the father of the late actor Peter Boyle Jr. most recently of "Everybody Loves Raymond" fame. "Offcier Pete Boyle" appeared in his own shows on WPTZ and many times as a guest on Ernie's. In fact, he played his "Officer Boyle" character the day that Jack appeared as a guest on "KOTC!"
Jack went to high school with Peter Boyle Jr. in the 1950s and Peter was an actor even back then. These photos are some extracts from a playbill that Jack kept from his high school days; they're for a musical called "Song Of Norway" in which the young Mr. Boyle appeared.
Peter Boyle Sr. hosted a very well known kids show in Philly called "Chuckwagon Pete" in which played the title character. Here's an ad he took out in the playbill:
You can click on the "Peter Boyle Sr." link above to see a photo of "Chuck Wagon Pete" and read more about the show.
P.S.- The Ernie Kovacs My Space Fan Page is up to 828 friends since our last post. As always we thank everyone who requested an add or accepted a request from us. We also thank you for the nice comments sent about Edie.
Jack wanted me to let everyone know that the year of the play was 1952, the first year he entered high school.
On Tuesday, November 19, 2013, MVD Entertainment Group will release "Here's Edie: The Edie Adams Television Collection"! This is a 4 DVD, 12 hr set of the entire run of Edie Adams variety show which aired on ABC from 1962-64. It is the first-ever release of her classic variety show after more than 50 years. Bonus material includes Edie''s musical numbers from the Ernie Kovacs show, a 16-page booklet with rare photos, program notes and her iconic Muriel Cigar commercials. Here's a link to a press release which also lists the contents of the DVDs. Keep your eye on the links page where a link, when available, will be posted so you can pre-order the set.

The Ernie Kovacs Collection: Volume 2 which will be officially released on Tuesday, October 23, 2012.
"The Ernie Kovacs Phile", a wonderful book by the late David Walley (aka "Nothing In Moderation: The Ernie Kovacs Story").
"Intersecting Parallels: Keaton and Kovacs," a wonderful article by Rob Foster. Here is the Paley Center For Media’s catalog listing for the pilot discussed in the article. It is available for viewing at either the New York or Los Angeles locations. Rob also wrote a great piece called Square Bubbles: Broadband In Kovacsland which poses the question of what Ernie might have been doing were he alive today. Rob also wrote a Kindle book of preexisting and new material, entitled "Ernie's Journey's."
The "Kinescope HD" Blog, run by Paul Gluck, is a fantastic blog about the early days of TV. You can search there for posts on Ernie and other greats from the Golden Age Of Television. Here's a post on EK's "The Silent Show" (aka "Eugene").
EK used to write a parody of " Ripley's Believe It Or Not" called "Strangely Believe Its" for Mad Magazine. Here's a scan of an installment.
This page on The Broadcast Pioneers Of Philadelphia Website talks about Ernie’s early days on WPTZ in Philadelphia, particularly the legendary and first ever morning show on television, "3 To Get Ready". No copies of this program exist; in fact it’s listed on The Paley Center For Media’s "Television Programs We’re Looking For" list. This 1951 newspaper article talks about Dave Garroway and mentions EK; it was Garroway's return to the airwaves to host "Today" that would eventually force "3 To Get Ready" off the air.
"Ernie Kovacs Presents Percy Dovetonsils...Thpeaks." This is a previously unreleased comedy album from 1960 available in a variety of formats, including lavender vinyl. You can order your copy visiting the link.

On this blog and its parent site Ernie Kovacs Dot Net A Tribute To Television's Original Genius you will see links to the majority of Ernie's material which is available for purchase. This includes (but is not necessarily limited to): Books, DVDs, tapes, CDs and memorabilia on various auction sites. A great deal of time and effort has gone into searching for and compiling lists of all that is available from sites that are reputable. We don't, however, assume any responsibility if you are unhappy with a purchase you make from one of these sites.
The only items that were sold directly by this blog and its parent site are from The Vision Of Ernie Kovacs retrospect; we had the inventory and we shipped it but it has sold out (you can click the link to learn more about these items in case you'd like to purchase them from other sources). We also offer "The Ernie Kovacs Collection" DVD set through our sites but we are not the shipper; the set is shipped to you directly from Shout Factory Video. You can buy this wonderful set with confidence and we fully endorse it.
This blog is written by Kovacs fans Al Quagliata and Ben Model. Al started writing for Ben's EK website in the mid 90s and then started his own. This is the middle ground where these two Kovacsians meet to bring you all the latest goodies from Kovacsland!
Al Quagliata is a an actor and guitarist with a passion for Ernie's work and Ben Model is the official Ernie Kovacs curator and historian. Ben is also a renowned silent film accompanist and composer who is the curator for silent films at the Museum Of Modern Art in New York City.
My name is Al Quagliata; I’m the editor of this blog and run the website Ernie Kovacs Dot Net A Tribute To Televsion's Original Genius. Even though Ernie Kovacs was the original video comedian and was so visual, there are very few clips on this blog and on my website. In most cases I can’t verify that the parties who post these clips (e.g. on sites such as YouTube and Facebook) have the right to do so and it’s not up to me to decide if they do, so as a general rule I don’t post clips. My feeling is that this material should be legally purchased so that the royalties go to the parties who own the rights. And, just because you purchase something, that doesn’t give you the right to post it online. In some cases the rights holders allow this streaming content on sites they run; that’s their call and has nothing to do with me, nor am I going to presume that I can do it without permission.
This goes for audio too: recordings of novelty songs, music from the Kovacs shows and various EK sketches, some of which are available on CD or LP. I understand that sometimes these items are hard to find but I am not going to provide links to free downloads.
With all this in mind please do not contact me asking for copies of videos, DVDs, CDs, LPs, or to ask me to stream video. I will not post ANY links to file sharing sites which are sent to me nor will I respond to any emails regarding same.
I can offer the following: The Museum Of Broadcast Communications in Chicago has their archives listed online so you can view the list. Some of these listings have a digital file accompanying them for viewing and ⁄ or listening. Sign up is free and there are some very interesting EK files available to watch and listen to online. My assumption is that a broadcast museum is not just putting up clips without permission which is why I’m willing to list the link.
While they don't have online viewing, you can visit the Paley Center For Media in New York or Los Angeles to view shows in their massive collection. The link will take you to a listing of everything they have regarding Ernie Kovacs so that you can plan your visit; you're limited as to how much time you can spend in the museum library and how many shows you can view on your visit so you wouldn't want to spend all of it searching the database. Write down the catalog numbers and titles of the programs you wish to see, which will make finding them easy once you arrive. Contact the museum for more details.

This post explores a few ideas, and the resulting experiments, I've had recently to put metadata (or arbitrary information) into vector GIS formats that have no provision for them. One typical such format is the good-old Shapefile format. A shapefile generally consists in 3 files, a .shp file that contains the geometries, a .shx that is an index from the shape number to the offset in the .shp file where the geometry is located (to allow fast retrieval by shape ID) and a .dbf file that contains the attributes of each shape.
Of course, the most simple way of adding metadata would be to but an additional file besides the 3 mentionned ones, but that would not be very challenging (plus the risk of losing it during copy).
Most implementations require at least those 3 files to be present. Some allow .dbf to be missing (e.g. GDAL/OGR). Some allow .shx to be missing, like OpenJUMP which doesn't read it even if it is available, which is both a feature and a drawback in situations when there are "holes" in the .shp due to editing.
A basic solution is to add our metadata at the end of one of those 3 files. I've done tests with GDAL/OGR (based on Shapelib), GeoTools 12.0, OpenJUMP 1.7.1 (whose shapefile reader is a forked version of the GeoTools one with changes), proprietary software code-named "GM" and proprietary software "AG"
.shp : all implementations happy, except OpenJUMP that opens the file, but throws a warning because it tries to interprete the additional bytes as shape.
It should be checked how they react in editing use cases, like adding new features to the shapefile. Regarding GDAL/OGR, I can say that it would overwrite the extra content at the end of the .dbf and the .shx. It would let the extra content at the end of the .shp to write the new geometry afterwards.
What if we want to "link" the metadata per feature in a way where it is preserved if shapes are added ? And for the sake of exploring more possibilities, we will exclude using the data-at-end-of-file track. Interleaving data and metadata is not possible in .dbf since the records are placed consecutively. Same for .shx. In .shp, we can try reserving some space between all geometry records and make sure that the .shx index takes the holes into account. Due to the fact that size and offsets in shapefile are expressed in term of 16 bit words, that extra space must be a multiple of 16 bit too. That works fine for all implementations, except OpenJUMP for the same reason as above. Hum, and what if we incorporate the metadata, not between the encoded geometries, but inside them ? Each geometry record is indeed structured like this :
We can try adding extra payload at the end of record content while still updating record length to take into account. We could have thought that implementations strictly checks that the declared record length is consistant with the shape type, but experimentations (and code inspection on the 3 Open Source implementations) show that, when they check, they check that the record length is at least greater or equal to the minimum expected record length. So this works for the 5 implementations ! At least on a layer with 2D polygons. That should also work for other 2D geometry type. 3D shapes consist in the 2D information, followed by the Z information, and optionaly by the M(eausre) information. M information is sometimes omitted when it is not present (this is the case of the OGR writer). So if we would want to add metadata for 3D shapes, we would have to write dummy M information (writting not-a-number double values is commonly done to indicate that M information is invalid).
To go back to .dbf file a bit, sometimes the width of fields of string type is larger than strictly needed. The values are left aligned in the field and remaining space is padded with space characters. I've tried to insert a nul character just at the end of the string, and put the extra information afterwards. This works fine for the 3 C/C++ based shapefile readers (GDAL/OGR, G.M., A.G) since nul character is conventionnaly used to terminate a string in C/C++. Unfortunately that does not work with the 2 Java based implementations that do not use that convention : the extra content is displayed after the field content.
As we have started exploring modifying the data itself, let's return to .shp file. One thing to consider is that coordinates in shapefiles are stored as double precision floating point numbers, stored on 64 bits using the IEEE-754 binary representation. Such numbers are decomposed like the following : 1 bit for the sign of the value, 11 bits for the exponent and its sign and 52 bits for the mantissa. The mantissa is where the significand precision of the number is stored. How big is that ? Let's go back to geography a bit. The Earth has rougly a circonference of 40 000 km. If we want to map features with a precision of 1 cm, we need 40 000 000 / 0.01 = 4 billion distinct numbers. 4 billion fits conveniently on a 32 bit integer (and OpenStreetMap .pbf optimized format store coordinates on 32 bit integers based on that observation). So 52 bits allow 2^(52-32)=2^20, roughly 1 million more numbers, i.e. a precision of 10^-8 meters = 10 nanometers ! We could almost map every molecule located on the Earth surface !
It is consequently reasonable to borrow the 16 least significant bits from the mantissa for other use. Said differently for every 2D point/vertex, we can get back 4 bytes without any noticeable loss of precision. Depending on the shape complexity, this might be not big enough to store per-feature metadata. But on a typical shapefile, if we spead the metadata over the features, we can certainly store useful content. And the really great news is that this metadata would be preserved naturally in most format conversions (at least with GDAL/OGR whose internal geometry representation also uses 64-bit floating point numbers, and probably most other geometry engines), and for formats like Spatialite or GeoPackage that also use 64-bit floating point numbers. However, one must be aware than any other operation like rescaling or reprojection would completely change the least significant bits and erase our metadata.
Admitedly this is not a new idea. People have explored similar ideas for digital watermarking and more generally steganography, typically used to embed copyright information or source tracking (i.e. you generate a slightly different dataset for each customer, hence if a copy is then available for download, you can identify the origin of the leak), generally in a not noticeable way. Using least significant bits is the very basic technique, that can be circumvented easily by just zeroing them or adding noise. More advanced technique operate in the spectral domain, like DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform), DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) or DWT (Discrete Wavelet Tranform). Some techniques have been specifically designed for GIS data, using topological properties for example. The common target of those techniques is to have robustness against attempts of removing the watermark from the signal, at the expense of a reduced bandwith for the inserted information. But for regular metadata, we do not need such guarantee and the use of least-significant bits might be good enough and easily implemented.
For polygons, the shapefile specification states that the vertices of the outer ring must be listed in clockwise order. But it does not specify which vertex of the outline must be the first one. Let's consider that the top-most vertex of the polygon is numbered 0 (if there are several vertices with the same y coordinate, let's take the one of them with the minimum x), the following vertex in clockwise order is 1, etc... If our polygon has 16 vertices, and we serialize it starting at vertex 11, we have coded the 11 number. Combined with information of following polygons, we can build a longer message. This idea could only work in practice for shapefiles of complex/dense enough polygons. If every polygon has 256 vertex, we can encode log2(256)=8 bits per polygon. More generally, for a polygon with N vertex, we could encode log2(N) bits (rounded to inferior integer). So we need also at least hundreds or thousands of polygons of that complexity to be able to encode something useful. The advantage of this technique is that it is robust to rescaling, and probably most reprojections (at least the one that globally preserve the appearance of shapes), provided that the shapes are rewritten in the same order as in the original data.
That technique could also be adapted for lines. Let's consider a line made of (V1,V2,....Vn). We can for example simply build a multi-polyline of 2 parts (V1,...Vi) and (Vi,....,VN) that will visually looks like the original line and will encode for the i value. The increase in binary encoding would be modest (4+8+8=20 extra bytes).
Another technique might be to use repeated vertices. Let's consider a line or a polygon: if while listing consecutive vertices, they are repeated, this would encode a 1 value. Otherwise 0. For example, if a line is made of the sequence of vertices (V1,V1,V2,V3,V4,V4,V5,V5,V6), it would be equivalent to binary number 100110. So we could encode as many bits as vertices in the geometry. If needed, we can also use more repetitions to encode more bits. For one bit per vertex, on average such a technique would increase shapefile size by 50% (because on average, half of bits in a message are 1). It would preserve metadata perfectly for all coordinate transformations (geometry engines generally operate on vertices separately). But not to operations that would remove duplicated vertices.
Finally, here's another idea, conceptually close to the one based on the starting vertex. Excluding implementations that don't rely on the .shx (I've no prejudice against such one ! Keep on good work folks !), we could use the order of shapes in the .shp to encode information. Traditionnaly, feature 1 appears first in the .shp, followed by feature 2, etc... But we could re-order the shapes as we wish, provided we make the .shx point to the right offset in the .shp. If we have N shapes, there are N! (factorial(N) = N*(N-1)*(N-2)*...2*1) ways of ordering them. So for N shapes, we can encode log2(N!) bits. In practice for 10 shapes, that is 21 bits. For 100 shapes, 524 bits. For 1000 shapes, 8529 bits. And for 10000, 118458. Advantages: works for all geometry types, no increase in file size. Inconvenients: possibly less performant sequential reading because of apparently random seeking within the .shp, doesn't resist to file conversion.
I've not mentionned it, but for nearly all mentionned techniques, especially the last ones, we would need to reserve a few bits to insert a CRC or any other integrity mechanism, so as to make sure that we think is metadata really is. And all them could be potentially combined !

What are the benefits of e-learning for kids? Nowadays, everyone knows that the technology was able to give some of its own conveniences of life. The education aspect is one of them. The concept of the education system that makes use of information technology in the teaching and learning process is called e-learning. If you want to implement e-learning system in teaching and learning process, you need to find out first what the benefits of e-learning for kids that you can get later.
One of the biggest the benefits of e-learning for kids is unlimited learning materials. Instead of ignoring the conventional library, the e-learning system allows you to obtain much more learning materials than the conventional library. You only need to type in a specific keyword on a search engine online and you can get the list of information from a variety of sources. And it also only takes a short of time.
You will get a big opportunity to explore more knowledge while doing e-learning. This is also the benefits of e-learning for kids. You will find a new information that will keep you getting curious. The good point is, you can soon looking for that information easily. That way, anyone who does e-learning can have many opportunities to explore any information.
The other the benefits of e-learning for kids is a flexible time. Learning in the classroom is indeed great for improving communication skills and socialization of students, but it cannot be denied that e-learning is superior in terms of flexibility. A student can study whenever and wherever they are, all they need is an adequate internet connection device.
The last part of the benefits of e-learning for kids is it matches the digital era. The various aspects of current life have begun to move into the digital realm. Any student learning activities will certainly be easier by implementing e-learning system. Especially, if the student uses a computer that all the features have been adapted to the student’s needs as well as the teachers.

In this dissertation we present the quantitative response of an epidemic of the so-called SIR-type, in a population consisting of a local component and a migrant component. Each component can be divided into three classes, the susceptible individuals, usually denoted by S, who are uninfected but may contract the disease, infected individuals (I) who are infected and can spread the disease to the susceptible individuals and the class (R) of recovered individuals. If a susceptible individual becomes infected, it moves into the infected class. An infected individual, at recovery, moves to the class R. Firstly we develop a model describing two interacting populations with vaccination. Assuming the vaccination rate in both groups or components are constant, we calculate a threshold parameter and we call it a vaccination reproductive number. This invariant determines whether the disease will die out or becomes endemic on the (in particular, local) population. Then we present the stability analysis of equilibrium points and the effect of vaccination. Our primary finding is that the behaviour of the disease free equilibrium depend on the vaccination rates of the combined population. We show that the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable if the vaccination reproductive number is less than one. Also our stability analysis show that the global stability of the disease free equilibrium depends on the basic reproduction number, not the vaccination reproductive number. If the vaccination reproductive number is greater than one, then the disease free equilibrium is unstable and there exists three endemic equilibrium points in our model. Two of these three endemic equilibria are so-called boundary equilibrium points, which means that the infection is only in one group of the population. The third one which we focus on is the general endemic point for the whole system. We derive a threshold condition that determines whether the endemic equilibria is locally asymptotically stable or not. Secondly, by assuming that the rate of vaccination in the migrant population is constant, we apply optimal control theory to find an optimal vaccination strategy in the local population. Our numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the control strategy. This model is suitable for modeling the real life situation to control many communicable diseases. Models similar to the model used in the main contribution of our dissertation do exist in the literature. In fact, our model can be regarded as being in-between those of [Jia et al., Theoretical Population Biology 73 (2008) 437-448] and [Piccolo and Billings, Mathematical and Computer Modeling 42 (2005) 291-299]. Nevertheless our stability analysis is original, and furthermore we perform an optimal control study whereas the two cited papers do not. The essence of chapter 5 and 6 of this dissertation is being prepared for publication.
It is 1874 of the Imperial Era. The War of the West has ended after nearly six years. On one side, the Kingdoms of Aequor, Galenthia and Ryalta – the Allied Powers. On the other, the Principality of Kentaire and the Holy States of Rikton – the Central Powers. Friends came and went; Navali, once a Central Power shifted in 1869 to neutrality, in order to deal with other foes. The Free City State Four Corners, officially neutral, showered the Allies with men, money and material. A treaty of peace has been signed at the Senate of the West. Both Galenthia and Aequor have agreed to terms and Rikton has followed, though none are truly happy with the strength that their former foe, Kentaire, has maintained. Mistrust and intrigue are rife.
Still, the end of hostilities after years of war has at least salved some wounds and means that garrisons can replenish, fields that have laid fallow for years can be sowed, and business can resume. True to the traditions of the Civilised West, however, true peace continues to elude all. In the east, the Vir Sidus Empire has nearly crumbled under the onslaught of the vicious Qatunax, who've pushed even into Aequor and Galenthia, carving out new lands for their High King. The goblins, their masters and whatever other creatures lurk in the Ergonian mountains are a constant threat, with the wilds of the borders becoming dangerous and unpredictable. In the far west, the mysterious sea borne Mitanga occasionally probe, while White Hall's fierce Ice Clans pillage and plunder the west coast of the civilised kingdoms and in the south, both the Empire of Partharia and the Principality of Alezzo wait for their chances to strike.
The winds blew and with them came the Empire of Partharia. At this moment most of the Fortresses on the Great Salt are under Siege. If you could not be in the 7 Oct battle but are a regular resident of one of the Fortresses, please put up a memoir about being, Under Siege. They did not use military ships to accomplish this. They literally flooded the Great Salt with Merchant Ships hauling huge numbers of Slaves and Client Kingdom soldiers.
Which to the educated mind means that the long delay before the attack was setting this up, and frankly GETTING all these ships and that the REAL Military hasn't arrived yet. Those of the Military Ships and their professional Soldiers.
A Social. On the walls looking at the enemy. Taunting them. Whatever. Even in the local Drinking Hole. Thanks to Dertan and Thomas, the Fortresses are VERY well supplied. So have a Pint and comisserate.

Airships are NOT running in Southern Aequor, or along the Coast. At All. At present. Which means if you want to travel in those areas speak to a Staffer. The East (ie Hellsmouth and Rhone is still being serviced)
Similarily, because they pass over the Coast, Airships are NOT traveling to Navali, or Ryalta. You can still get to Four Corners but it takes a very round about way that does not touch the coast.

TEDxBrussels is back for its 8th edition at Bozar in Brussels on the 6th of March 2017 from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. The world-renowned TEDx conferences aim to disseminate innovative and positive ideas that can change the world.
TEDxBrussels is unique on the European scene in this aspect and invites artists, entrepreneurs, inventors, researchers and thinkers to share their ideas with the public.
A true spa for the mind, the event touches on a range of subjects – from philosophy and science to art, politics… Subjects that we interact with on a daily basis, and that have a tremendous impact and influence on our lives.
This year, ‘No Limits’ is the thread running through all presentations. Out with the familiar, with limits and borders: only then can we truly take on challenges that at first sight seem insurmountable.
Curator Rudy Aernoudt: “No limits mean that the speakers and artists will be forced to leave their comfort zone and take the audience into a breath-taking experience without borders. It will be an invitation to embrace exciting topics without any boundaries or limits.”
TEDxBrussels is supported by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Brussels and Visit Brussels.
TEDxBrussels has the pleasure to announce the Belgian and International speakers that will help make the 2017 edition a success. They will share their points of view and ideas with the somewhat 1600 attendees at Bozar.

For years, Herbert W. Armstrong warned the world that a German-led United States of Europe would win WWIII. It appears that dreadful time is upon us.
The FT reports that EU member states seem to be closer to a deal on hedge fund rules. This comes after France dropped its opposition in principle to the introduction of a passport giving managers of funds based in third countries marketing rights throughout the EU, once they meet certain regulatory conditions. However, French officials insist that the power to issue such a passport should be entirely remitted to the new Paris-based European Securities and Markets Authority.
Meanwhile, Reuters reports that the US Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has written a letter to French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde, warning that "a proposal that limits or delays the access of third country firms to a passport - while granting EU domiciled managers and funds access to the European market - would be discriminatory and contrary to G20 commitments. We would consider adoption of such a proposal as unfair and damaging to our shared interest in maintaining an open, global financial system".
The Swedish Parliament, the Riksdag, and the German Bundesrat have objected to the Commission's proposed amendments to the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive. Under the amended Directive, deposit guarantee schemes must offer depositors up to â¬100,000, if their bank collapses. The schemes are to be 75% pre-funded from bank contributions, with the remainder coming from other sources. However, the Riksdag is opposed to a provision in the Commission's proposal which could see an EU country being forced to lend money to other member states' funds, if these funds face a shortfall. The Riksdag, going against the Swedish government, said that such mandatory lending could lead to some member states under-funding their deposit schemes, knowing that someone else would act as the lender of last resort. The Bundesrat and the Riksdag also argued that the provision represents a violation of the EU's subsidiarity principle.
The Lisbon Treaty gives national parliaments the right to ask the Commission to re-consider - but not scrap - a proposal, if a third of national parliaments object to the proposed legislation within an eight week window. The deadline for national parliaments to object to the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive is 25 October, and so far only six parliaments have even begun scrutinising the proposal, since it coincides with parliamentary recesses in most countries. This is the first time the new provision in the Lisbon Treaty has been tested. The Bundestag will today decide whether to officially object to the proposal, reports DPA.
FT Deutschland reports that the European satellite navigation system Galileo will far exceed previous cost estimates, needing an additional â¬1.5bn to â¬1.7bn. Galileo will launch with a 10 year delay and cost the European taxpayer about â¬20bn over the next 20 years. Klaus Hagemann, member of the budget committee for the German SPD party, said that "it's a very big deal that it is only revealed now that Galileo will need long term subsidies".
The Parliament reports that the EU has contracted the AFP news agency to provide 24 hour media coverage of the European institutions in six languages. The contract, worth an estimated â¬10m over four years, will also "establish image banks illustrating the themes of major importance to the commission, the parliament and the councilof Europe." AFP has issued a statement saying, "AFP has decided to develop this activity as a totally separate entity from editorial; the contract is being managed by a wholly-owned subsidiary of AFP and by a specially formed unit to avoid any possible conflict with its traditional role as a news agency."
Stern reports that German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has offered his resignation to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which has so far been rejected. Eurointelligence notes that his possible successor Thomas de MaiziÃ¨re is "known for his eurosceptical views."
The Nouvel Observateur reports that French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner could quit his post shortly.

There is widespread coverage of William Hague's announcement yesterday that the Government will table a European Union Bill containing a sovereignty clause and 'referendum lock'. The Mail quotes Open Europe's Stephen Booth welcoming the proposals but warning, "These safeguards are not enough in order to inspire public trust on their own. There are still areas under the Lisbon Treaty, such as justice and home affairs, where there is still a day-to-day risk of powers being ceded to Brussels and EU judges in particular."
The WSJ reports that Ireland was hit by a further ratings downgrade by Fitch yesterday. City AM quotes Evolution Securities' Gary Jenkins saying that the markets are pricing in an Irish bailout. He said, "Clearly there isn't a default scenario being priced in because otherwise the yields would be a lot higher. At the moment Europe daren't do anything other than bail them out because the system is so fragile that if one country fails the knock-on impact could lead to a complete meltdown." However, he added, "But fast forward four years: if the economic outlook is rosier, the ECB might allow one of them to go".
The Irish Times reports that Ireland's EU Commissioner MÃ¡ire Geoghegan-Quinn has denied Brussels is "dictating the pace" of current austerity measures to the Irish government.
In The Journal.ie, Declan Ganley, Chairman of the Libertas group, evaluates Ireland's economic situation one year after the Lisbon Treaty was approved in a second referendum, arguing that "one year on, we are closer to ruin, and farther from recovery, than could have been imagined possible". He argues that "We were told it would make the EU more democratic - but we are still being lectured by unelected commissioners...We now have the spectre of the EU Commissioner telling us that we must become a high tax economy - instead of being free to focus on growth and renewal".
At yesterday's EU-China summit, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao hit back at EU criticisms that China's currency is undervalued, saying "don't join the chorus pressing to revalue the yuan", warning that the move would "bring disaster to China and the world", reports the WSJ. The Summit also saw China push the EU to reclassify China as a 'market-economy', in a bid to reduce tariffs for Chinese exports to Europe.
The Independent reports that financial regulators from the 27 EU member states will today meet in the City of London to agree new rules on bankers' bonuses. The article notes that the most interesting outcome of today's meeting will concern how much of bankers' remuneration packages will be paid in cash, with the FSA proposing that 50% of any remuneration package should be in shares or other equivalent non-cash instruments.
Bloomberg reports that chief executives at Denmark's top three financial companies have advised that the country may stay out of the euro for at least five more years. Public support for the euro is dwindling; the last poll showed that 47% of Danes support the euro, compared to 51% who want to keep the national currency.
A leader in the FT argues that the European Parliament should ratify the EU's new free trade deal with South Korea in order to dispel the popular opinion that "MEPs are less immune than the European Commission to protectionist interests and the lobbyists in Brussels who promote them."
EU transport ministers are poised to strike a deal that would require lorry drivers to pay for the environmental harm caused by their vehicles. The new rules would apply to any motorway in the EU.

The agreement will be voted on by the European Parliament's plenary session on 20 October.
EUobserver reports that a group of EU Commissioners from smaller member states is growing increasingly angry with a number of their larger-state colleagues, perceiving their actions as being driven by national interests.
Final negotiations on the controversial Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) have been completed in Tokyo, with EU sources insisting that the draft accord will not restrict the freedoms of EU citizens or require legislative changes.

It is not in Germany's mind today, or its present peaceful people, to wage war against us, but that will all change overnight, after a head-on collision with the Islamic leader of a confederation of Muslim states, their mahdi, whetting Europe's appetite for more blood and morphing the EU into THE BEAST. They will destroy all Muslim opposition with a vengeance.
Whereas most Germans are not aware of vile intentions of influential Germans under Jesuit influence to revive the unholy Roman Empire of the German Nation, the Fourth Reich, to embark on a new crusade into the Middle East, Beyond Babylon: Europe's Rise and Fall bares their grand design before the world: the German-Assyrians will strike again!

One of our most anticipated albums of 2017 has finally been officially announced. Despite previous rumours about an album titled Ylajali, Fleet Foxes will actually release Crack-Up on June 16 through Nonesuch Records.
The album marks the band's first full-length since 2011's Helplessness Blues. It was entirely written by bandleader Robin Pecknold and co-produced by Pecknold and his longtime bandmate, collaborator and childhood friend Skyler Skjelset. When it came time for actual playing, they were joined by fellow bandmates (all multi-instrumentalists) Casey Wescott, Christian Wargo and Morgan Henderson.
The full tracklist for Crack-Up can be found below, while the scenic album artwork is pictured above.
The first sample of the new material has arrived with lead single "Third of May / Ōdaigahara" — an epic nine-minute ode to the titular Japanese mountain, bolstered by piano, electric 12-string guitar, a string quartet and the group's signature vocal harmonies. Give it a listen below.
The band have also announced a slew of world tour dates, including two shows at Massey Hall in Toronto on August 4 and 5. See the band's full itinerary below.
UPDATE (3/28, 1:40 p.m. EDT): Fleet Foxes have now added a Vancouver show, which will take place on September 13 at the Malkin Bowl. Tickets go on sale Friday (March 31) at 10 a.m. PDT. The band have also announced a string of more intimate Pacific Northwest shows in the U.S. for mid-May. You can see the updated schedule below.

I can’t remember a time recently when a game had me as emotionally engaged as much as Phoenix Online Studio’s series Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller. Everything about the characters and the story had me hooked to the point where I literally had to see the series through to its end. It was completed within a few days. The entire series takes indie-gaming to a whole new level, and at the end of Episode 4 (the latest and final chapter) I was still sitting there taking it all in.
Although the game has been released episodically over the last year or so, the latest episode was released recently on September 19th 2013, and is perfect for gamers who are looking for a point and click adventure with enough plot-twists and cliffhangers to keep you hooked to your PC. Even better, now that the whole series is available on Steam, fans of the original and players who are new to the game will get all four episodes in one go from the very beginning, which as an added bonus, means not having to wait for the next episode to be released.
Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is a detective mystery thriller with a unique twist. Playing as FBI Detective Erica Reed, you are on the hunt for a serial killer called The Cain Killer. When The Cain Killer kidnaps Erica’s brother, things become a lot closer to home. Erica’s goal throughout the series is fixated on the pursuit of The Cain Killer and putting him right where he belongs, behind bars, and she won’t stop until she sees justice. A few years on, and Erica is doing her thing, when a new murderer comes on the scene. The difference with this one is, this new killer seems to know Erica’s secret. You see, Erica is no ordinary detective. She has the ability to see into the past upon touching someone or something, and can use this special ability to her advantage by using it to piece together the many clues of a crime scene. It becomes apparent that somebody else knows about her special powers, and so the mystery as to who this person is and how they are linked to the ‘Cain Killer’ continues.
Erica’s talent is one of the most interesting aspects of the game, and is used greatly to advance the story forward. Every glimpse of an item, every memory from a person’s past becomes an indent or impression of a bigger picture, and eventually when the story starts opening up, everything that Erica has seen, examined or felt, cognitively or otherwise, becomes a part of something so much bigger. Throughout each episode, and as she starts to learn more about herself, Erica’s powers begin to evolve, which in turn takes the game in some interesting and riveting directions. The game starts off at a reasonable pace, with Episode One more about exploring Erica’s powers and the people she surrounds herself with in her everyday life. Much of the time is spent getting to know the people she works with, and acquainting herself with the world surrounding her. Although the story doesn’t flesh out until the end of the first Episode, I actually preferred the way in which the game started planting the seeds of mystery, and found it a joy to experience and uncover the world in which she lives. This made the character’s seem a lot more real, and had so much more emotional impact when it truly mattered. The only other time this has truly happened, has been when playing the Mass Effect Series, and it’s remarkable to see how another game can truly hook in and emotionally engage the player to the point where every moment throughout the series is of sheer importance. Cognition, without a doubt, is a series that most definitely gets better as you play.
The writing and dialogue in Cognition is first-class, and remarkably well presented. Every character throughout the series feels very real, and each conversation had is very believable. The voice-acting is outstanding, and this is all topped off with a fantastic soundtrack that needs no introduction; the band in the game is none other than ‘The Scarlet Furies’, and the music fits together with the game’s dark tone considerably. The aspect of the game which blew me away the most, however, had to be the game’s fantastic art style, and its incredible cut-scenes, that brought the game alive and created the most enthralling atmosphere throughout.
Unfortunately, Cognition, is fantastic a game as it is, doesn’t go without it’s flaws. Being glued to the game from beginning to end made it easy to highlight a few of the issues that had a slight negative impact on the overall experience. The characters animations, especially when walking and moving, were on the awkward side, and sometimes the animations were so broken to the point that they would literally have the character disappearing, or sliding across the floor in a crazy manner. The Steam version, however, has since been patched.
Furthermore, though the majority of the puzzles in the game were well-designed, and complex in the best way possible, there were a few puzzles throughout that literally were so frustrating that it was beyond impossible to not use the handy hint system to figure out what was going wrong. The greatest feature of the game has to be that if you get stuck, there’s always somewhere to turn to help you along the way. “HEY DAD, HELP ME.” (Erica’s Dad has the answers to everything, apparently. This is not a bad thing, the guy knows his stuff.) So, in any case, for the gamer who loves a challenge, the puzzles in this game will certainly go down well. Though I, on the other hand, struggled with some of the more complex ones, it was quite the enjoyable process to figure out the solution and the process never got old, especially since there was a whole variety of different puzzles and challenges to overcome.
Cognition: An Erica Reed Thriller is without a doubt, one of the most accessible story-driven point-and-click adventure games that I have had the honor of playing, and I believe anyone who loves a good mystery story, with some interesting and unique elements of gameplay will fall in love with this straight away. The game’s overall presentation outshines any potential issues, and if you’re someone who loves a good emotionally-driven story, you will not want to miss this masterpiece of a game.

« Fierce and sullen was the countenance of Styrbiorn, yet quiet, as of a fierce beast charmed with music, as he watched that dance of the rolling surges sweeping and pausing and falling and rising again : Ran's eternal children leading their round as if in sad ceremonial observance of some divinity hidden apart, removed form all knowledge or communion of human kind ; and listened to the swelling roar of the breaker as it rod on, the thud and thunder of its fall, and the grinding hiss of the shingle in the back-wash, as if wrath, which is older than the world and older than the Gods, drew in its breath once again, pondering some greater mischief. »

Here’s what you need to know about enrolling in a health insurance plan for 2019, including information on how GoodRx can help you save on your prescription drug costs.
In most states, open enrollment begins November 1 and ends December 15, with all plans becoming effective January 1, 2019. Whether or not you live in a state with its own enrollment platform, start at www.healthcare.gov to search for a marketplace plan that’s right for you.
There are a total of 12 state-run insurance marketplaces that have some flexibility in terms of enrollment schedules. Seven of them have extended enrollment periods:
California: Open enrollment for 2019 is October 15 to January 15. California residents who enroll after December 15 will be covered starting February 1 instead of January 1.
Colorado: Open enrollment for 2019 is November 1 to January 15. Colorado residents who enroll after December 1 will be covered starting no later than February 1.
District of Columbia: Open enrollment for 2019 is November 1 to January 31. DC residents who enroll between December 16 and January 15 will be covered starting February 1. Those who enroll after January 15 will be covered starting March 1.
The remaining five state-run marketplaces (Idaho, Vermont, Connecticut, Washington and Maryland) are slated to follow the November 1 to December 15 schedule, but last-minute extensions could still be added before the end of open enrollment.
Check this page for updates on enrollment deadlines for state-run marketplaces: www.healthcare.gov/marketplace-in-your-state.
Plan changes and new enrollments outside of the open enrollment period are only possible for people who experience a qualifying event. Enrolling in health insurance outside of open enrollment is called special enrollment, and the deadline for enrollment is 60 days following the qualifying event. If you miss that deadline, you’ll have to wait until the following year’s open enrollment period to apply.
For more information about special enrollment and qualifying life events, visit this guide here: www.healthcare.gov/coverage-outside-open-enrollment/changing-plans.
A lot has changed in health insurance policy recently, including the loss of federal subsidies for insurers, an increased availability of short-term, non-ACA-compliant plans, and the repeal of the individual insurance mandate. Reading about what these changes mean can be dizzying, but in short, they all impact insurance availability and pricing. Here’s a summary of how these changes will affect your options for next year’s ACA plans:
Participation of health insurance companies in ACA marketplaces will increase. In 2019, we’ll have a total of 155 state-level health insurance issuers, 23 more than what we had in 2018. This might sound promising, but how accessible plans will be within states remains to be seen. In 2018, rural counties saw disproportionately fewer insurance options than urban counties.
Options for qualified plans will increase. The average number of qualified health plans (QHPs) on ACA marketplaces will go up from 25 in 2018 to 26 in 2019. QHPs are plans that meet minimal benefit and cost-sharing standards, along with other requirements as defined by the ACA. In addition, more people will have more than one option for an insurance issuer.
Premiums for silver plans will go down, but still remain high. From 2018 to 2019, the average premium for a 27-year-old on a silver plan will decrease by 2%. But that’s not saying much considering premiums in 2019 will be 85% higher than that in 2014. Most people who enroll in a plan through the ACA marketplaces choose a silver plan.
Average monthly subsidies will decrease by 3%. Cost assistance in the form of subsidies are available to those who qualify and purchase an insurance plan through the ACA marketplaces. If you received subsidies in 2018, you may see your monthly subsidy drop a bit next year. However, average subsidies in 2019 will still be 110% higher than the average subsidy in 2014.
Access to low-cost plans will continue to decrease. Only 6% of current enrollees in 2018 have access to a plan with a premium of $200 or less compared to almost 40% in 2015. That percentage will drop again in 2019 to 5%.
The individual mandate will disappear. Health insurance protects people against unexpected and overwhelming medical costs. However, starting in 2019, you will no longer get a tax penalty for not having “minimum essential coverage” as defined by the ACA. The individual mandate, which currently requires most Americans to carry a minimal level of health coverage or else incur a fine, was repealed and will only stay in effect up until the end of this year.
If you enrolled in your current plan through an ACA marketplace, open enrollment is your time to choose a different plan. If not, you will most likely be enrolled again for 2019 in the plan you already have. This might sound nice, but plans change every year—including their premiums, benefits and coverage—so be sure to log in and re-enroll before your open enrollment deadline.
Some insurers may leave the ACA marketplace after December 31. If you currently have ACA coverage, but your insurer is planning to leave the marketplace at the end of the year, you will be automatically enrolled with a different insurer unless you pick a new plan by the end of open enrollment. Depending on which state you live in, you may be eligible for a special enrollment period, which will give you 60 days after your old plan ends to enroll in a new plan.
GoodRx discounts can help you get the best deal on your prescription medications, even after you enroll in health insurance. In many cases, just because a drug is covered doesn’t mean it’s affordable. And having insurance doesn’t guarantee that your drug will be covered at all.
So, don’t forget to shop around. Check GoodRx coupon prices for your medications against their prices with your insurance, and choose whichever option is cheaper. If you don’t already know what your copay will be for a prescription, call your insurer or use their web portal to get an estimate of your cost.
When using GoodRx instead of your insurance to pay for a prescription, your payment won’t count towards your deductible. However, you can always contact your insurance company to see if you can submit a receipt and apply that towards your deductible. Some plans will allow you to submit receipts for potential reimbursements or deductible credits.
Need more than a coupon? GoodRx can also help you find savings tips, suggestions for alternative, less-expensive drugs, and information on assistance programs and manufacturer savings.

Posted On December 27, 2017 at 5:11 am by	admin / Comments Off on New PDF release: Bard of Liberty: The Political Radicalism of Iolo Morganwg
this can be the 1st full-scale research of the political radicalism of Iolo Morganwg, the well known Welsh romantic whose vibrant lifestyles as a Glamorgan stonemason, poet, author, political activist and humanitarian made him one of many founders of contemporary Wales. This path-breaking quantity deals a shiny portrait of a common contrarian who tilted opposed to the forces of the institution for the entire of his grownup existence. referred to as the ‘Bard of Liberty’ or the ’little republican bard’, he moved in highly-politicized circles, embraced republicanism, based the Gorsedd of the Bards of the Isle of england, threw in his lot with Unitarians, promoted a feeling of cultural nationalism, and supported the anti-slave alternate crusade and the anti-war circulation in the course of years of struggle, oppression and cruelty.

This booklet is the 1st research of Coleridge's responses to his goals and to debates at the nature of dreaming between poets, philosophers and scientists within the Romantic interval. Coleridge wrote and skim commonly at the topic, yet his different and unique principles have hitherto acquired little recognition.
First released 1984. In a provocative examine, this publication argues that the issues posed by means of Shelley’s notoriously tough variety needs to be understood with regards to his ambivalence in the direction of language itself as an inventive medium — the strain among the opportunity of language to reflect emotional adventure and the popularity of it’s inevitable boundaries.
First released in 1969, this ebook locations Coleridge’s literary feedback opposed to the heritage of his philosophical pondering, reading his theories approximately feedback and the character of poetry. specific realization is paid to the constitution of Biographia Literaria, Coleridge’s contrast among mind's eye and Fancy, his definitions of the poetic characters of Shakespeare and Wordsworth, his research of the psychological kingdom of audiences in theatres, and his interpretations of Paradise misplaced, Hamlet and Aeschylus’ Prometheus.

I think my creative spark was cultivated among the trees and born in the creek beds of Southeastern, Ohio. Or you can just grow up anywhere but always hear words a bit differently than others. You listen to the way your Southern mother says brain and it sounds like braing and you secretly love the way words roll out of mouths. You pretend to be British on the front porch while you roller skate back and forth the concrete slab. You perfect Alice in Wonderland passages and repeat them like a tic throughout the countryside.
Or at least that dreaded kind of person who was friends with everyone. The person who is at the base level pretty likable. I straddled the line of all of those types (the Jock, the Brain, the Criminal, the Princess and the Kook ) I never fully committed to one type, but I got inside them all and learned their language. I learned their movements and motivations.
Practice the American phenomenon of drunk writer. Work on eating life. Work on intense relationships with others. Charm the writing department. Nod to others about the next step and an MFA and all that jazz. Write good shit. Write shit. Write more than you ever knew could come out of one person. Start to question yr purpose. Start to realize you are cursed and blessed as an artist.
March ahead. Time. Have children. Have career. Forget about writing all of those pages that came like a fever back then.
You may even ditch that original idea or it could be lost in the ether like mine was with a mac notebook death three years ago. You may go way off course like me. Quit a career in an unstable economy and start to write. Then start a toy company.
Take a calendar and plan it out. Then something will happen like you will get knocked up and have 9 months to really do what you want. I have taken on more than I ever should have lately, but I am doing it. I have a very concrete goal of turning in something that resembles a manuscript (or a shitty first draft) on August 23rd to a friend who is going to help me ready it for the query process. I will have a baby and then sometime over the holidays when you are all drinking excessively and throwing decor around I will sit in a small room of my own and edit like a banshee.
1. I saved some money and have hired a sitter two days a week. I am ruthless with my time during those hours. I will only write. Even if Joe came home in the afternoon unannounced and devastating romantic I will not kiss his lips.
2. I carry a small notebook and fountain pen with me all the time. I scribble scrabble perfect sentences and little conversations and tiny words when they strike me.
4. I have developed a relationship with a mentor. I trust this person and they are helping me edit and discover things about myself as a writer. I reached out to a writer that I admire (bc I am ballsy like that) and although they were honest enough to let me know they did not have the time to help me they directed me to a person that helps them sometimes. It has been like a a magical connection. Like I always knew this person.
5. I read and read and read like always. I keep current on what it out there. I grow jealous over others accomplishments but I plunder on. I stop comparing myself to others.
I wonder why I have this compulsion to write a novel when it is really hard for me. Essays and poems would be easier. But it is there. This cast of characters that live in my head and talk to me.
6. I have a binder from Target and every week I print out what I have accomplished and place it inside. It grows fat like me and I smile. But I also shudder because it is unedited and raw.
7. I tell my boys that I am a writer. I think the more times I hear it out loud the better. I keep hearing it and saying it and now towards the end it makes more sense than it did before.
It was like hearing almost yr name or a variation of yr name being called across a field and turning.
And even if I fail like so many writers do the first time round the sun, I won't freak out because it has been a true experience. Joe is proud of me and I am proud of me too. Even if it never gets anywhere it will have been this one shiny penny moment of my life. I have been practicing my query letter though. I am trying to infuse it with love and charm and bliss. I want it to seep out magic. I want it to make someone swoon. We all want that.
Now excuse me. My babysitter comes soon. I have five weeks till this baby comes and many more words to throw down. I have stories to plant. I have rows to hoe. I have gold star days ahead of me.
I am so inspired by this, Amy. You are following your dream, and it is a dream I so desperately want to follow, myself. I opened a biz and had a baby 4 weeks later, so I can completely relate. But writing a novel? That's an entirely new level of awesome. I am bookmarking this and promising myself that I'll get there one day, too. Since I already write at length in my head *constantly*, I think I might already be on my way. Thanks for this...and GOOD LUCK! I can't wait to buy my first copy:) xo
I am so with you. Except I usually have to do it one night a week, as I have to do my day job when I have a sitter. But yes, I hear you! Be strong!
One thing I learned from my first journey through the publishing process is that it's SUPPOSED to suck. It's SUPPOSED to be hard. Nothing worth a stinky crap has ever been accomplished by someone who didn't claw and grapple her way through like you are.
Next chance we get can we really and truly sit down and have a meal together, with dessert, and maybe pillows and couch and floor afterwards. I want to tell stories.
It takes one to know one and I know you can do it. You have it in you. I recently finished my first draft that was very overdue. Very. Keep the vision, keep the hope. Enjoy it! It's fun when you get one of those groove moments.
I love love love this post. It also confirms that beng crazy alone doesn't mean I have a novel in me. And that's ok.
You can do it! This is how it happens, you put yourself in the right frame of mind first, and then when you hit a little speed bump, you don't easily forget why you're there.
When you do get around to querying, there are amazing web resources to help you. www.querytracker.net is amazing, among other sites!
Like Blake says "I will not reason and compare. My business is to create!" Sounds a lot like you, Amy.
For too long I have read your blog without commenting. I have loved your posts, and how you arrange words into stories and snippets that are beautiful and real.
So now, with a newborn on my lap & similar dreams in my heart I am writing to thank you for this post (& many others).
I just read a RT of your baby coming today... good luck, sugar! And oh my, how this post inspires me... I have to do better about blocking out the way the house looks in order to carve out the time for myself - it's so easy to get distracted by small stuff and small people underfoot... you've got it all. I'm excited for you!! I'll be reading...
Wow...I came across this randomly and it is so beautiful. It's a great example of how we look to the end as success but in reality your process is successful as you have inspired so many already...including me! Thank you!
This post speaks to me.. I just had a baby 18 months ago and I am launching a handbag line.... I totally relate to being crazy with my time.. we have a baby sitter a day and 1/2 a week. I love that you are following your dream.....

First off, Dorkgasm will be covering Chicago Comic-Con for the second year running! We'll have people on the floor, gathing information and seeking out new contacts and new stories the entire run. Last year we met with the guys from Fangoria Graphix and Dabel Brother's Publishing, and this year we look forward to seeing old faces, as well as new. If you're reading this and have a booth you think we should stop at, drop us a line in the comments or shoot us an email!
One of those covering the event, and this is our second announcement, is our new intern, Jenny! We're excited to see new writers come into the fold, and are proud to support educational pursuits. Jen's never been to Comic Con before, so we look forward to her reactions! Will she be disgusted by the unwashed masses? Or will she get so caught up in how many celebs they have lined up for this year's show? I don't know, but my money is on her finding something that catches her eye so much she forgets what time it is.
This brings us to our final announcement. As you know, it costs money to keep a company going, even one focused on publishing directly to the web. I am proud to say, we'll be online for at least another 3 years! Having said that, it can only mean that we had to re-up our contract with our server because we've been live and online for over two-years now! Not a lot of webistes do that, and though we've only got a small following, we're proud that you're along for the ride! Hell, Entertainment Weekly hasn't stopped butchering genre news, so why should we stop posting it in an informed manner?
Speaking of EW, anyone see the latest vampire issue they did? Not only is Klaus Kinski mentioned instead of Max Schreck (no offense to Herzog, but a remake is a remake), but they also run out of ideas and foolishly put Blade on their list of "best vampires". The whole article reads like it was written by a 14 year-old kinder-bat emo girl who humps her pillow at night after sneaking back from a friends to watch Twilight for the 80th time and who can't help but complain that Eric on True Blood is pretty, but "just too mean". Yeah, they still don't get it...
For a real taste of kick-ass, original vampire action, I suggest you pick up Dabel Brother's Mercy Thompson comics, or watch the Daybreakers trailer again. And to think, I used to be one of those guys who complained about Buffy? I'd welcome it back if I never had to hear about anything shimmering ever again!

Dormbase is a web-based system that provides MIT dormitories with the tools and services they need for daily operation. It is an open source software project that was started by Simmons Tech in response to their and the resident’s need for reliable, modern, and user-friendly online services. Dormbase means a consistent user experience across all of MIT’s dorms, accessible to residents, desk workers, and administration. It is a community project that solves a community problem.
MIT’s current dormitory systems are not representative of the Institute. They lack oversight and are highly fragmented, making updates and maintenance difficult. These systems are also unfriendly. Information is obscured by poorly designed interfaces and fundamental use cases are time consuming. Inadequate attention was paid to the user’s needs, dissuading residents from taking advantage of online resources.
The core Dormbase team consists of four dedicated developers and a designer. The project, however, has recieved support from numerous other contributors.
A friend let me know last night that he had just run the Mindjammer RPG for a group of very smart high school kids, and that the game went very, very well. It has brought a smile to my face all day. There's a pleasure in playing, and there is a pleasure in running, and I guess there is also pleasure in seeing your far away friends having fun too.
Maybe somewhere really far, far away someone is playing something like Mindjammer right now. If you're really, really quiet you can almost hear the 4DF hitting the table around that distant blue star.
Thanks for posting that - that's so cool to hear, and I'd love to know more about the game! I send a huge Mindscape thoughtcast greeting to your friend and all the players - the Commonality salutes you!

"In your day you have learnt to calculate something of the magnitudes of space and time. But to grasp my theme in its true proportions, it is necessary to do more than calculate. It is necessary to brood upon these magnitudes, to draw out the mind toward them, to feel the littleness of your here and now, and of the moment of civilization you call history." - Olaf Stapledon

MANKATO, Minn. — (10:05 a.m.) The Minnesota Department of Transportation has lifted the no travel advisory for southcentral and southwest Minnesota that was issued earlier this morning due to heavy snow and high winds creating near zero visibility in the following counties: Cottonwood, Jackson, Martin, Watonwan, Faribault, Rock and Nobles.
Motorists should use caution when traveling, as many roads are still fully covered with snow and slippery.
MnDOT reminds motorists to be patient while snowplow operators work to improve driving conditions. The majority of snowplow crashes take place during “clean up” when motorists resume their normal speeds.
The public can view winter road conditions from real-time plow cameras available through the 511mn.org website. Please note that not all plows have cameras.
In southcentral and southwest Minnesota there are 83 snowplows that work to state highways in the 13-county MnDOT District 7. In southcentral and southwest Minnesota, MnDOT plows 3,325 lane miles. An average route for drivers is 34 miles. MnDOT snowplow operators are doing their part to make highways safe.
Check road conditions at 511mn.org or call 511; it takes time to get roads back to good driving conditions.
Stay alert for snowplows that turn or exit frequently and often with little warning. Plows may also travel over centerlines or partially in traffic to further improve road conditions.
"There is one Body and one Spirit ... there is one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of us all..." Ephesians 4:4-6
"Accept him whose faith is weak, without passing judgment on disputable matters ... Who are you to judge someone else's servant? To his own master he stands or falls ... So then each of us will give an account of himself to God ... So whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and God." Romans 14:1,4,12,22
"... If I hold in my mind not only all human knowledge but also the very secrets of God, and if I have the faith that can move mountains - but have no love, I amount to nothing at all." I Corinthians 13:2 (Ph)
God is the Creator and Ruler of the universe. He has eternally existed in three personalities: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. These three are co-equal and are one God. (Genesis1:1, 26, 27; 3:22; Psalm 90:2; Matthew 28:19; II Corinthians 13:14; I Peter 1:2)
Jesus Christ is the Son of God. He is co-equal with the Father. Jesus lived a sinless human life and offered Himself as the perfect sacrifice for the sins of all people by dying on a cross. He arose from the dead after three days to demonstrate His power over sin and death. He ascended to Heaven's glory and will return again someday to earth to reign as King of kings, and Lord of lords. (Isaiah 9:6; Matthew 1:22-23; John 1:1-5, 14:10-30; Acts 1:9-11; Romans 1:3-4;1 Corinthians 15:3-4; I Timothy 6:14-15; Titus 2:13; Hebrews 4:14-15)
The Holy Spirit is co-equal with the Father and the Son of God. He is present in the world to make men aware of their need for Jesus Christ. He also lives in every Christian from the moment of salvation. He provides the Christian with power for living, understanding of spiritual truth, and guidance in doing what is right. He gives every believer a spiritual gift when they are saved. As Christians, we seek to live under His control daily. (John 14:16-17, 16:7-13; Acts 1:8; I Corinthians 2:12, 3:16; II Corinthians 3:17; Galatians 5:25; Ephesians 1:13, 5:18)
The Bible is God's Word to us. It was written by human authors, under the super-natural guidance of the Holy Spirit. It is the supreme source of truth for Christian beliefs and living. Because it is inspired by God, it is the truth without any mixture of error. (Psalm 12:6, 119:105, 160; Proverbs 30:5; II Timothy 1:13, 3:16; II Peter 1:20-21)
People are made in the spiritual image of God, to be like Him in character. People are the supreme object of God's creation. Although every person has tremendous potential for good, all of us are marred by an attitude of disobedience toward God called "sin". This attitude separates people from God and causes many problems in life. (Genesis 1:27; Psalm 8:3-6; Isaiah 53:6a, 59:1-2; Romans 3:23)
Salvation is God's free gift to us but we must accept it. We can never make up for our sin by self-improvement or good works. Only by trusting in Jesus Christ as God's offer of forgiveness can anyone be saved from sin's penalty. When we turn from our self-ruled life and turn to Jesus in faith, we are saved. Eternal life begins the moment one receives Jesus Christ into his life by faith. (John 1:12, 14:6; Romans 5:1, 6:23; Galatians 3:26; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5)
Because God gives us eternal life through Jesus Christ, the true believer is secure in that salvation for eternity. If you have been genuinely saved, you cannot "lose" it. Salvation is maintained by the grace and power of God, not by the self-effort of the Christian. It is the grace and keeping power of God that gives us this security. (John 10:29; II Timothy 1:12; Hebrews 7:25, 10:10, 14; I Peter 1:3-5)
People were created to exist forever. We will either exist eternally separated from God by sin, or eternally with God through forgiveness and salvation. To be eternally separated from God is Hell. To be eternally in union with Him is eternal life. Heaven and Hell are real places of eternal existence. (John 3:16, 14:17; Romans 6:23, 8:17-18; I Corinthians 2:7-9; Revelation 20:15)

Honda has a very positive reputation when it comes to being first in many categories which never cease to disappoint the everyday driver. We expect nothing but excellence from Honda, so why would anything else be the case for their subcompact crossover? The HR-V was first seen in the flesh in 1999, built on the “Supermini” platform, though this example never made it to North American shores. After being introduced as a concept in 2014, by popular demand the car was finally introduced to the public as a 2016 model year vehicle. Tested here is a 2017 Honda HR-V EX-L Navi AWD, equipped with a continuously variable transmission.
This is the top trim available for the HR-V, which does not see a “Touring” or “Elite” trim like its siblings, the CR-V (reviewed here) and Pilot. Painted in an elegant Milano Red paint scheme and accented with a black leather interior, the HR-V sees the typical Honda styling cues that are reminiscent of a more grown-up version of the Fit subcompact. With rivals in the subcompact crossover class including the Mazda CX-3 and Subaru Crosstrek (reviewed here), we found it fit, pun intended, to take a close look at the HR-V, which is one of the pioneers of its segment and now one of the oldest entries around.
Powered by a 1.8L single overhead cam i-VTEC four-cylinder motor with a 10.6:1 compression ratio, the HR-V has yet to see the turbocharged 1.5L seen elsewhere in the Honda lineup. The 1.8L sees two available transmissions, including a standard six-speed manual on the base front-drive model. All models equipped with the all-wheel-drive system get the CVT automatic equipped here. AWD is something that Canadians will opt for, and becomes standard on the EX-L though is available across the line.
Honda’s aging naturally aspirated 1.8L motor is good for 141 horsepower at 6,500RPM and 127 lb-ft. of torque at 4,300RPM. Surprising considering the low output numbers, the HR-V’s CVT does a good job keeping the revs higher when merging onto the highway and remaining in i-VTEC range. It also makes some satisfying noises, but the challenge is that it’s outclassed by nearly everything in its segment. Even the Subaru Crosstrek’s 152-horse motor is quicker, and considering the other options in Honda’s own lineup (including the standard K20 2.0L in the lower trim Civic), it’s due for an update. Throttle response is adequate, and the drive-by-wire system, while not the sharpest, does the job decently well for most drivers.
The HR-V’s electrically assisted power steering feels light, but there is ample heft to it. The steering is fairly good and beats the Toyota C-HR for feel, but the Mazda CX-3 (reviewed here) and the entry-level Hyundai models like the Tucson offer better feel and more driver engagement overall. The HR-V is equipped with a conventional front strut and torsion beam rear suspension setup, configured for a more comfortable and refined ride. Don’t expect it to perform like a Civic Si (reviewed here) in the corners and you’ll be happy enough, with minimized body roll and the ability to absorb bumps reasonably well. T
Overall, the HR-V’s interior isn’t as quiet as we expected for this segment, with plenty of road and tire noise making its way into the cabin. Materials are far better and finish is improved over the Fit that it shares its platform with, given that the HR-V is a little bit newer. A 7” touchscreen infotainment system is standard, but the HR-V is one of the last in the Honda lineup to get the most recent updates with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. This is almost guaranteed to be added in the forthcoming refresh of the vehicle. The EX-L’s seats are pretty comfortable and do an adequate job of supporting passengers.
The HR-V may be outperformed by the Mazda CX-3, but where it trumps the Mazda is in interior volume and packaging. For a subcompact crossover, rear legroom is remarkably good, and thanks to the higher roofline, four full-sized adults are reasonably comfortable for longer trips. The signature “Magic Seats” offer a few configurations to utilize the 58.8 cubic feet of storage space, allowing plenty of room for all of your belongings, a standard sized baby stroller, or some camping gear for that weekend cottage getaway. Keeping you warm or cool is Honda’s easy-to-use automatic climate control system, one of the best in the business.
Thanks to Honda’s good CVT and an active Eco-Assist system with an “ECON” button, the HR-V manages to remain fairly efficient even when equipped with all-wheel-drive. This configuration is rated at 8.4L/100km in the city and 7.5L/100km on the highway. We saw city numbers slightly worse than the suggested efficiency, with 8.5L/100km, but over a quick jaunt to Prince Edward County, the HR-V delivered a very palatable 7.1L/100km combined. As with everything else in the segment, regular 87-octane fuel is all that’s required.
In its most basic trim, the HR-V LX with the manual transmission starts at just over $23,000. Honda includes heated front seats, a rear-view camera, and alloy wheels for this price. The vast majority of Canadians will opt for the LX AWD, which, for $26,650 adds Real Time AWD and some minor features. At $32,350, our top-trim EX-L Navi includes everything available, including lane departure and forward collision warning, leather interior, a power sunroof, roof rails, and much more.
Where the challenge lies with the Honda HR-V is its overall age and lack of active safety features, something that its competitors are all offering. The age itself isn’t the issue, as it’s only two model years old at this point, but these safety features have become an industry standard very quickly. Honda has a brilliant Honda Sensing suite of tech that is offered elsewhere in the lineup, but it hasn’t made its way down to the HR-V yet. One significantly large elephant in the room is Honda’s own Civic Hatchback (reviewed here), which has nearly the same amount of interior space, more technology, and a superior powertrain for less money than the HR-V. The only compromise there is a lack of all-wheel-drive and some ground clearance, but most buyers will be able to do just fine with a solid set of snow tires.
With new entries like the Nissan Qashqai (reviewed here) and the slightly-updated Mazda CX-3 for the 2018 model year, the Honda has a little bit of catching up to do. The Toyota C-HR doesn’t offer all-wheel-drive, but has funky styling and Toyota’s Safety Sense on board, and is likely to attract some younger buyers away from the HR-V. T 2017 Honda HR-V EX-L Navi AWD is a comfortable and efficient little crossover, but it’s worth waiting for the mid-cycle refresh to get some of the tech updates to go along with Honda’s legendary reliability and build quality.

A web server is a piece of software that enables a website to be viewed using HTTP. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the key protocol for the transfer of data on the web. You know when you're using HTTP because the website URL begins with http:// (for example, http://downloadfullfree.com
You might be thinking "I always thought a web server was a special, high-powered computer". Well, you'd be right too. Some high-powered computers are referred to as web servers as they have been built with web hosting in mind. But in most cases, when someone refers to a web server, they are referring to a piece of software that you install on a computer.
That depends on which web server you choose to install. In general there is one website (called Default Web Site), one FTP site (called Default FTP Site), and one SMTP virtual server (called Default SMTP Virtual Server).
You might also be thinking that web servers are way too advanced for you - that they are only used by professional web developers and/or hosting companies. Please don't think that!
And, depending on your computer set up, you may even find that you already have a web server on your machine.
Now, having declared that "web servers are easy!", there are many advanced topics regarding web servers. I won't be going into any detail in this tutorial. You can get a web server up and running on your machine with a minimum of technical knowledge. Then once you've done that, you'll start to become familiar with the various options available to you. Then if required, you can research the more advanced topics to suit your needs (such as security, load issues, logging etc)
While you can certainly create and test HTML pages on your local computer without a web server, most web professionals use their own web server.
There are many advantages to using a web server within your development environment. Of course, in a production hosting environment, a web server is essential. And, depending on your website, a web server could indeed be essential in your development environment.
When I say "development environment", I'm referring to a copy of your website, usually on your local machine, that you use to perform updates before you commit them to the live (production) environment.
In practice, you could have many copies of your website for different purposes (such as testing, training, protypes etc), but let's just call it "development environment" for now.
When someone learns how to code HTML, chances are, one of the first things they learn to do is how to view their (newly created) HTML file. They will learn that you can simply double click on the HTML file, and this will launch it in their web browser. And from that point on, they can view their web page/website as it was intended to be viewed.
One problem with the above method is that, you're not viewing the website using the HTTP protocol (you're using the file protocol instead).
Now, this isn't normally a problem if you're only using client side languages such as HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript. But it is a problem if you're trying to use a server-side language such as PHP, ColdFusion etc
Also, even if you're not using a server-side language, it could still cause you problems with developing a website that behaves exactly how it should on the web.
There's a common set of features that you'll find on most web servers. Because web servers are built specifically to host websites, their features are typically focused around setting up and maintaining a website's hosting environment.
Create one or more websites. (No I don't mean build a set of web pages. What I mean is, set up the website in the web server, so that the website can be viewed via HTTP)
Configure log file settings, including where the log files are saved, what data to include on the log files etc. (Log files can be used to analyse traffic etc)
Configure website/directory security. For example, which user accounts are/aren't allowed to view the website, which IP addresses are/aren't allowed to view the website etc.
Here's an example of the Properties dialog box from Microsoft IIS. This box is displaying the properties for a single website. To display the box, I simply right-clicked on the website and selected Properties.
You can see that the website has been configured to use the local path of c:\inetpub\wwwroot. What this means is that when you update your website, you need to place your files and folders within that directory. As soon as you do that, your changes will take effect on your website. Of course, if this is your development environment, you can simply edit the files straight from that directory.
Whenever you view a web page on the internet, you are requesting that page from a web server. When you type a URL into your browser (for example, http://downloadfullfree.com/p/index.php ), your browser requests the page from the web server and the web server sends the page back.
Your web browser first needs to know which IP address the domain name downloadfullfree.com resolves to. If it doesn't already have this information stored in it's cache, it requests the information from one or more DNS servers (via the internet).
The DNS server tells the browser which IP address the domain name resolves to (and therefore, where the website is located).
Now that the web browser knows which IP address the website is located at, it can request the full URL from the web server.
When referring to web browsers and web servers in this manner, we usually refer to them as a client (web browser) and a server (web server).
A web server can (and usually does) contain more than one website. In fact, many hosting companies host hundreds, or even thousands of websites on a single web server.
Each website is usually assigned a unique IP address which distinguishes it from other websites on the same machine. This IP address is also what the DNS server uses to resolve the domain name.

8/10 I'm not a girl, so I knew next to nothing about Anne Hathaway, I went to see Meryl Streep and oh boy, did I see her. An inedited Meryl Streep, far, far away from anything she has ever done and that is saying something, isn't it? Blazing with self confidence, Miranda Pristley is a monumental modern queen. Hints of human trouble at her own personal castle doesn't disturb that imperious facade and her extraordinary talent to say "No" I may be totally out of touch but I just wanted Anne Hathaway out of the way. It bother me so much. I longed for the young Julie Christie in that role. The Christie of "Darling" can you imagine? Then yes you have a battle of the titans not a predictable, tired, phony fairy tale. When Hathaway's boyfriend tells her "You have become one of them" I wanted to shoot myself because that's obviously what was suppose to happen but other than different outfits and make up I saw no difference in the girl. I enjoyed very much Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt's performance and I'm recommending the film just to witness Meryl Streep, the greatest actress of our or any generation, dazzles us with an extraordinary new face.
7/10 Unmissable for Meryl Streep fans. She plays second fiddle to Anne Hathaway here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. Meryl Streep is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From Sophie's Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, Meryl/Miranda transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. Anne Hathaway is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see Meryl be Miranda. You'll have a lot of fun.
9/10 For the past month or so, I have been eagerly awaiting this movie. I love Meryl Streep, I like Anne Hathaway, I though the world of magazine publishing could make a great setting for a movie, and I thought the premise of the book 'The Devil Wears Prada' had a lot of movie potential. So, now that I've seen it, I have to say it is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year. The screenwriter has maintained everything that was funny about the book, as well as chucked a lot of the duller subplots, and has formulated a movie that is a great deal more enjoyable than the book.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the basic premise - naive small-town girl comes to the big city hoping to be a journalist, and gets a job as assistant to Miranda Priestly, the much-feared editor of 'Runway' magazine (a thinly veiled take on 'Vogue' magazine, and its editor). Thankfully, the cast was almost perfect (though I did think Simon Baker was somewhat miscast at the rakish writer who takes a liking to the protagonist, Andrea), and elevated the movie to a level it would not have otherwise reached.
Meryl Streep is absolutely amazing as Miranda Priestly, and I especially liked the way that, as Miranda, she never raised her voice above normal speaking level. Streep has said she based this mannerism on Clint Eastwood, who as Dirty Harry talks very quietly but still intimidates. This made Miranda much more interesting than the stereotypical, screaming gorgon she could have become. She is certainly the best thing about this movie, and I think the odds are good that she'll score a best-actress nod at the next Oscars. Miranda is also made more complex (and slightly more sympathetic) than in the book, which I thought was very good. In the book, which I recently read, the author (who actually worked as an assistant to 'Vogue' editor Anna Wintour) was very bitter and whiny about the difficulties of her former job, and she made Miranda out to be a totally two-dimensional villain with absolutely no redeeming qualities. However, the movie shows us (briefly) a different side of Miranda - we see the compromises she has had to make to get to the top, and we see the toll this has taken on her personal life. We aren't made to agree with her diva-like behaviour, but we can understand how hard her life must be.
I also thought that Anne Hathaway was very appealing in her role - she made Andrea more likable and less snobbish than she was in the book (although the screenwriter deserves credit for that, as well), and she looked great in the couture she wore through most of the movie.
The supporting players were also very good, especially Emily Blunt (as Andrea's caustic fellow assistant, Emily) and Stanley Tucci (as Miranda's loyal but beleaguered right-hand man, Nigel). On many occasions, they stole scenes from the ostensibly 'central' character of Andrea.
The movie, while maintaining the book's premise, does not follow the book too closely, which I liked. The entire 'Lily' subplot from the book is eliminated (readers of the book will know what I mean), and Andrea's parents and boyfriend are less significant in the movie than in the book. I agreed with these changes, though - I found those aspects of the book to be quite boring, and their omission made for a more streamlined movie.
I strongly recommend this movie to virtually anyone, and I just hope "The Nanny Diaries" (another somewhat-similar 'chick lit' movie adaptation, coming out soon with Scarlett Johannson, that I am eagerly awaiting) lives up to the shining example of this excellent movie.
9/10 I had been told that Merryl Streep is great in this movie but the movie isn't really very good, so I went in with very low expectations. Maybe that was good: I really liked "The Devil Wears Prada" a lot.
Maybe I liked it because of two things I had in common with Andy: first, I have had the experience of starting a new job with only the vaguest idea of what I was supposed to do (and how to do it) and finding that everyone expected me to perform competently, without any training or help, right away. Second, I have had a boss (female) who was so difficult to please and so willing to tell her underlings how stupid they were that several quit without even waiting until they could find other jobs. In other words, I could really relate to Andy's situation. Stuff like that actually does happen in the real world. Perhaps, that is the reason that I was possibly the only person in the theater who was hoping Andy would not make the choice she made.
One thing that Miranda Priestley (Merryl Streep) had going that my Boss From Hell did not was class. It would have been very easy to create Miranda as a monster, but, wisely and skillfully, Merryl Streep allowed her to have a dignity and intelligence that made her seem to be demanding but not sadistic.
Stanley Tucci is superb as Nigel, the ambitious, hard working man who dreams of having a position of power like Miranda's some day.
"The Devil Wears Prada" is a very funny movie that is not as far divorced from the real world as, I believe, the producers of this movie may have thought.
6/10 The Devil Wears Prada struck me much like the industry that provides its backdrop  pure surface, well promoted and unabashedly convinced of its own importance. If this was in fact the point of the piece, it is an absolute success. Otherwise, this highly-publicized film is painfully predictable and merely another incarnation of a plug-in script whose story arc has been traversed over and over . . . and over.
Let's see, it goes something like this; basically decent, idealistic, young (man/woman) goes to (New York/Chicago/Los Angeles/D.C.) to make his/her mark in (writing/business/music/acting/government) only to be temporarily seduced by the very environment/person they are the antithesis of, alienating his/her(boyfriend/girlfriend/family/friends/all of the above) in the process until he/she stumbles on to the revelation, "To thine own self be true." Devil is all of this. . . again. Only the trendy names being dropped have been updated for those who find that sort of thing significant enough to make them believe this is somehow a different story.
The characters, as written, are equally as plugged-in and predictable. The film is only watchable because of the efforts of three actors. Streep is superb -- as always -- as Miranda Priestly, the self-absorbed, career-obsessed and patently unpleasant publishing mogul. Every incredulous look and pursed lip is right on the mark. She is not however, showing us anything we haven't been shown before  either about her acting or about women at the top. Even Miranda's obligatory "vulnerability scene" is thin and comes too late in the film to matter. By the time we witness what angst she is capable of, we really don't care. We are left with less a feeling of empathy than a sense of justice. (If you want to see her be truly chilling and ruthless, check out the remake of Mancherian Candidate.)
Likewise, Emily Blunt, as Miranda's first assistant, does a wonderful job as an insecure, over compensating slave to someone else's expectation. Her portrayal is cattily on target and provides the requisite foil to our heroine's wide-eyed innocence. Performance-wise this is commendable, but it leaves the audience with next to nothing to like about her character. The dilemma here is that the film presents her (as well as the character of Miranda) in such a way that we have this nagging feeling maybe we are supposed to like her in some way  and yet, we don't. This creates even more of a dilemma later on when Andrea  our supposedly intelligent, perceptive and grounded protagonist, played forgettably by Anne Hathaway-- makes attempts to befriend these two soulless women. Many are left to perceive her gestures as a weak and irritating need to be liked rather than any real nobility of character.
The one true bright spot of the film is Stanley Tucci, as Nigel, who once again seems to infuse a refreshing dimension and humanity to a character that was probably not written that way. He continues to amaze.
Cinematically, The Devil was a small-screen script seemingly shot for the small screen. It no doubt will look stunning when it reaches HBO to be embraced by all those starving fans of Sex in the City and many others who believe that haute couture must surely be the apex of man's cultural accomplishments and that watching insensitive, catty women snipe at each other is actually entertaining.
Billed as a "comedy/drama," the film was never very touching and only mildly amusing. There were no new insights or honest laughs -- the kind you share with friends about the mutually-experienced absurdities of life. No. The audience responses were more like those sophisticated, obligatory snickers that you exchange over lattes with people you don't really know that well -- and are reasonably certain you wouldn't want to spend time with again.

Action at a Distance: Systemically Administered Adult Stem/Progenitor Cells (MSCs) Reduce Inflammatory Damage to the Cornea Without Engraftment and Primarily by Secretion of TNF-α Stimulated Gene/Protein 6 *
Previous reports demonstrated that the deleterious effects of chemical injury to the cornea were ameliorated by local or systemic administration of adult stem/progenitor cells from bone marrow referred to as mesenchymal stem or stromal cells (MSCs). However, the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of MSCs on the injured cornea were not clarified. Herein, we demonstrated that human MSCs (hMSCs) were effective in reducing corneal opacity and inflammation without engraftment after either intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intravenous (i.v.) administration following chemical injury to the rat cornea. A quantitative assay for human mRNA for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) demonstrated that less than 10 hMSCs were present in the corneas of rats 1-day and 3 days after i.v. or i.p. administration of 1 × 107 hMSCs. In vitro experiments using a transwell coculture system demonstrated that chemical injury to corneal epithelial cells activated hMSCs to secrete the multipotent anti-inflammatory protein TNF-α stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6). In vivo, the effects of i.v. injection of hMSCs were largely abrogated by knockdown of TSG-6. Also, the effects of hMSCs were essentially duplicated by either i.v. or topical administration of TSG-6. Therefore, the results demonstrated that systemically administered hMSCs reduce inflammatory damage to the cornea without engraftment and primarily by secretion of the anti-inflammatory protein TSG-6 in response to injury signals from the cornea.

Have you ever wondered if you have sleep apnea? Have you been diagnosed, but you question how “real” the condition is, compared to other health problems? According to research and statistics, sleep apnea is a very real and potentially fatal condition, and if you show symptoms of the disease, you need to be assessed in a sleep study. Simple, non-surgical treatment may literally save your life and can certainly improve your health, relationships, energy level, and overall quality of life. For an appointment to speak with a sleep apnea professional, call Dr. Stephen Gershberg in Bryn Mawr, PA today.
According to research, 18 to 22 million US residents, over 6% of the nation’s population, suffer with sleep apnea to some degree. Think about 15 people you know. Out of those, one has sleep apnea – is it you? Of 6%+ who have sleep apnea, 2 to 4% are undiagnosed. They have no idea that they suffer from sleep apnea, so they’re doing nothing to treat the condition.
Six million Americans have moderate or severe sleep apnea that could land them in the emergency room. Of these, 500-thousand are undiagnosed.
Up to 25% of infants and children have sleep apnea, and most are between two and eight years of age. Children with sleep apnea may suffer from inattentiveness at school, hyperactivity, mood swings, and/or poor control of impulses. Snoring is the common symptom in most young sleep apnea sufferers, and obesity contributes to the risk for sleep apnea in children. Of the 263-thousand tonsillectomies performed in the US each year on children, the majority are an effort to remove the tonsils that block airflow and cause obstructive sleep apnea. Kids with sleep apnea are also at a higher risk than others for developing cardiovascular disease later in life.
A study by University of California, San Diego, indicates that out of 346 Caucasians and 54 African Americans, only 8% of the Caucasians had sleep apnea, and 17% of the African Americans suffered from the condition. This research begs the question, are African Americans at higher risk? More studies need to be conducted, but the concept is plausible.
Sleep apnea may be obstructive, central, or complex. While there are three types of sleep apnea, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is by far the most prevalent, and the most easily treatable. OSA occurs when the airway is blocked completely, due to soft tissues in the back of the throat or in the mouth.
During nighttime rest, a person with sleep apnea may stop breathing 60 or more times each hour, which is the equivalent of 400 or more episodes of apnea each night. With cessation of breathing comes reduced blood oxygen levels, which stresses the body. Apneic episodes also disrupt sleep, so sleep apnea patients never achieve the deep REM sleep necessary for the body and mind to function properly.
People who are obese, have a neck circumference over 17 inches, and men over 40 years of age are at the highest risk for developing sleep apnea. Loud, chronic snoring may indicate that a person has sleep apnea, though not everyone who snores suffers from sleep apnea.
The only way to diagnose sleep apnea is through as sleep study, most often performed in a sleep lab during an overnight stay. During this analysis, the patient sleeps while sleep experts monitor blood oxygen levels, brain waves, leg movements, respiration rate, and the number of full and partial apneic episodes per hour.
In addition to causing many nagging physical and psychological issues for the patient, sleep apnea can negatively affect the patient’s bed mate. Because of restlessness, snoring, and waking up with gasps and coughs, the sleep apnea sufferer often disrupts the sleep of anyone who shares a bed or room with him. Studies show that the partner or roommate of a person with sleep apnea can suffer from sleep deprivation, one of the same issues that affects the patient himself.
A sleep apnea patient who is not undergoing therapy or treatment is at a four times higher risk for stroke than those without the condition. They’re three times more likely to develop heart disease, the leading cause of death for men and women in our nation. Nearly 40-thousand people die each year of heart problems (hypertension, high blood pressure, etc.) related to apneic sleep disorders.
Because lack of sleep causes daytime drowsiness, motor vehicle and work-related accidents are also more likely in OSA sufferers. In fact, truck drivers diagnosed with OSA must seek treatment or they will not be allowed to drive.
Furthermore, sleep apnea sufferers may have problems with anesthesia and pain medication, because these drugs can cause soft tissues to relax more often and longer than normal.
The least invasive treatment option for OSA patients is an oral appliance called a sleep guard. This device fits comfortably in the mouth and is worn any time the patient sleeps. It keeps the airway clear of soft tissues, so apneic episodes cannot occur. A sleep guard is small, convenient, easy to use, and makes no sound.
For many years, a continuous positive airway pressure machine, or CPAP, has been the standard treatment for OSA, and it is still recommended by many sleep physicians. A CPAP consists of a main unit that compresses air. The air is sent continuously into a tube, which ends at a mask that fits over the patient’s nose. By administering a constant flow of air, CPAP keeps the airway clear during sleep. While the device is effective for many, some people dislike or cannot tolerate CPAP. Common complaints include:
OSA patients who also have trouble falling or staying asleep should discuss with their physician treatment options for these additional concerns. Over-the-counter sleep aids can exacerbate sleep apnea episodes, so don’t try to self-medicate.
Patients can also modify certain behaviors to reduce the severity of OSA. For instance, stop smoking; do not drink alcohol in excess or before bedtime; get adequate exercise; if obese, lose weight; try sleeping on your side, instead of on your back.
After reading this article and considering your symptoms, if you believe you may have OSA, schedule a consultation with Dr. Stephen Gershberg. His Main Line-area snoring and sleep apnea treatment center serves patients from Philadelphia, Delaware, and New Jersey by providing non-invasive, non-surgical treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.

In 2006, LAPIERRE™ celebrated its 60th birthday and launched on this occasion a folding mountain bike called Passport. The new “à la carte” program, Web Series, allows riders to choose the components of their road bike with the help of an on-line configurator. Because LAPIERRE™ bikes are assembled in France, riders in Europe can receive their personalized bikes 2 weeks after placing their order with their authorized LAPIERRE™ dealer.
2007 : LAPIERRE introduced their latest advancement in rear suspension in 2007, the OST suspension platform, especially tailored to long-travel bikes. Two mountain bikes using this technology were introduced, the Zesty and the Spicy. The goal of OST was to create the ultimate all-mountain bike with the perfect lightweight blend of versatility, performance, and optimized geometries, for total riding pleasure.
LAPIERRE pushed even further its export activities. Its products are now distributed in most European countries as well as in North America and Asia. LAPIERRE has become an international brand.
The Development Research Up-take in Sub-Saharan Africa is committed to strengthening research uptake capacity and participation in the international development research system in 24 sub-Saharan universities across 12 countries. The goal is to improve accessibility and utilization of locally relevant research evidence to inform national and global dev't policy and practice. DRUSSA also works towards strengthening the capacity of policy makers in Uganda and Ghana to use research evidence.
Argentina, Brazil and lately Chile has proven that countries like Uganda with huge comparative advantage in the production of agricultural commodities with well-organized value chains can join the premier league of nations that are well respected and forces to reckon with. Sadly, most of the agricultural commodities, and particularly food staples produced in Uganda, are lost post-harvest due to lack of value added processing. For instance, only 26% of the total agricultural volume produced in the region is processed post-harvest on average as shown in Figure 1.
It has been estimated that the East African Community (EAC) region loses about 30% of cereals, 50% of roots and tubers, and 70% of fruits and vegetables post-harvest. Because of inadequate value added agro-processing, the region’s exports are mainly in raw form, which means that a high proportion of commodity value does not accrue to the region. Reversing this trend could improve the region’s food and nutrition security, and help create jobs for the millions of unemployed men, women and youth.
Studies have shown that low value addition in the EAC is caused by, inter alia, weak agricultural commodity value chain development and linkages; low investment in last mile infrastructure (roads, water, energy, telecommunication, etc.); gaps in requisite skills and technological know-how; limited scale economies in production and processing; inadequate financing; limited and unsustainable risk mitigation strategies; inadequate investments in farming, agribusiness development and development of agro-industries; and weak legal, regulatory and governance frameworks. Even where agro-industries exist, they are often faced with low capacity utilization arising principally from lack of adequate and timely supply of the right quality and quantity of raw materials due in part to low agricultural productivity, poor last mile infrastructure and scattered and small-scale production that increases collection, coordination and transaction costs.
Two commodities, namely, milk and beans are a common denominator in diets in Uganda across different income divides thus good candidates to consider in studying their value chains. Milk and beans prominently feature among the priority staple food commodities with potential for agro-processing in the EAC as shown in Matrix 1.
Refining, aggregation of crude oil, contract farming & Mini-Estate Processing Enterprise approach by medium-scale processors
Sadly, besides cooking at homes and the catering sector, there is no significant value addition to beans in Uganda; consumers also tire of monotonous flavour. Cans on the market are of poor quality. Uganda the leading bean producer in Africa imports canned beans from Italy, Brazil, and USA to mention but a few. Targeted capacity building in areas where Uganda has an edge would be a very good starting point given the resources and organization needed to develop functional value chains. As a result, an increasing number of people are abandoning or reducing their bean consumption despite its documented high nutrient content and health benefits. Prospects of marketing increased quantities of beans and new agro-processed bean products within the EAC markets requires carefully examining production and marketing constraints (increased farm productivity, producer incentives, and access to better markets). Equally important is examining prospects for increasing demand for beans and agro-processed products (understanding consumers’ tastes and preferences, increased consumer awareness of benefits of consuming beans and other value-added products, increasing consumer choices of value-added products, etc.) especially treatments such as de-hulling, soaking, milling, fermentation and germination or malting and cooking enhance the digestibility and nutritional value.
A case in a point is the powder milk production and market. Although the EAC offers a good market for powered milk, it suffices to note that as a region we have practically handed over the market to major players in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, USA and Mid-Eastern countries that are dry desert sands because any investor seeking to establish powder milk processing capabilities at the local, regional and global level needs to pay attention three issues that are currently to our disadvantage, namely: 1) Capability to deliver at least 200,000 litres of milk per day. 2) Low energy bills since milk has to be stabilized, homogenized, concentrated, spray dried and bed dried. 3) Technological dependence. A reconditioned powder milk line costs in the region of € 1,700,000. A brand new one of any of the three brands of Relloy, Damro, or Carlisle costs between the € 3,500,000 and € 4,000,000. More often than not, Carlisle demands to do a detailed feasibility study themselves, before providing the quotation and the customer has to meet the cost of the study.
Succinctly studying milk and beans to specific targeted capacity building along respective value chain is a worthy while undertaking for DRUSSA fellowship and makes sense to vast majority of farmers and policy makers in Uganda.

....The most honest and useful advice I ever heard about dissertations came from Darren. I wrote to ask him what finishing was really like (this was when I was still a few months out). Tragically I've lost his original reply, but the gist was, "Eventually you will realize that you can't finish by treating the dissertation like a day job. It is a godforsaken monster that will continue to ruin your life until finally you've had enough and you just decide to kill it. After that, you may put in impossible hours and push yourself right to your limits, but you will finish. It's the only way I know to do it." [Darren, if you have the original thing you sent, please feel free to resend it or post it as a comment. UPDATE: Darren just posted it in a comment, below, and as I suspected it's much better than my paraphrase.]
That was certainly true in my case. The only thing that finally made me face finishing was my committee's insistence that I needed to get it done that semester. And even then I spent the first half of the spring of 2007 treating the diss. like a day job. It wasn't really until the final month and a half that I went into overdrive, literally staying up past my bedtime every night and gradually letting every other concern in my life slide. It sucked, bigtime. And after I filed I didn't look at the diss. at all for about three months. But I did get it done and filed.
It might be possible to just decide, "Okay, I'm going to finish my dissertation now," no matter where in the process you are, but I doubt it and I wouldn't recommend it even if it is possible. I think it's more like trying to climb Everest when there's a storm coming. There is some point up the side of the mountain when you are close enough to the summit to make a dash for it. There's no point in starting the dash until you're that close; otherwise you'll just exhaust yourself and possibly die of exposure. So for now just keep grinding away, a little here and a little there, until you are (a) sick to death of it and (b) close enough to make a run on the summit.
I read some books on writing when I was trying to write my diss--possibly more displacement activity--but none of them were worth a damn. The book that I wish I'd had then but only discovered recently is Steven Pressfield's The War of Art, which I cannot recommend highly enough. It's shelved in the Self-Help section at the bookstore, which strikes me as perverse. It's not really that. It's more like a personal philosophy on how to think about your work and all the things that keep you from getting it done....
I do recommend The War of Art, to everyone. Jarrod put me onto it. It's a short read, but pithy, and decidedly non-lame. I put it up there with Paul Graham's essays in terms of great writing about how to do useful stuff in the real world.
I just ordered a copy of Pressfield's book; thanks for recommending it! It's definitely been a struggle working on my book and trying to motivate myself to do some other projects, so hopefully it will have a positive impact on my writing.
Darren: Sadly, not really. As you might recall I went through a profound dark phase before killing the fucker. My only advice is something that is already familiar to you: you have to summon the power to WANT to kill it, and then GO GO GO, work all night to break its back, even if that means no sleep for a week. This is, literally, the >only< way I managed to finish it. Those few hours here and there just weren't enough. It might also help to plan some big celebration for when it's done: this is what we did, and it honestly did help. I had a whole day of pub-going, then a big dinner party, then a massive [... deleted ...]

Have you ever wondered whether you could save some money doing the car repairs yourself? Have you wished you could select a better auto repair shop or be able to better diagnose the problem with your vehicle? Take the time now to keep reading about some great tips for making the right decisions when it comes to your auto repairs.
Do not take your car to the first mechanic you find. You need to do some research to find a reliable mechanic with fair prices. Ask your friends and family about the mechanics they have been to in the past and check the Internet to find reviews written by other customers.
Make sure the oil in your vehicle is changed about every 3,000 miles. Waiting longer for an oil change can result in dirt and debris fouling your oil and that can damage your engine. If you use synthetic oil in your vehicle, you only need to change the filter every other oil change.
Your wiper blades should never be forgotten about. You need new windshield wipers if they are making noises or leaving streaks. Your wiper blades should be replaced at least once each year.
A dent or scratch in a plastic bumper is very easy to fix. Start by cutting the bits that stick out from the dent until the edges are smooth. You can then use a filler to make the dent disappear. Sand over the area and paint to hide the repair.
You should get your tires aligned and inflated on a regular basis. You can easily check the pressure and inflate them but you will probably need a professional to align them for you. Keep your tires in good shape will make handling your care easier and can even improve your gas mileage.
There are some shady mechanics out there, and they will resort to extreme lows to get your money. If a mechanic tells you that your axle boot is torn, ask to see it. A legitimate tear will be jagged and greasy. If it is a straight cut, let them know that you know they did the damage and you will contact a lawyer if they don’t fix it for free.
Take your owner’s manual with you when you go to the auto repair shop to get work done. If someone tells you that you need to get a service after a certain amount of miles, check and see if that matches what is in the manual. If it does not, let them know that you decline that particular service.
Always get your timing belt repaired at the proper time, according to your tune-up schedule. A timing belt going out can cause major engine damage, leading to much bigger repairs. Those repairs can run into the thousands of dollars, so don’t ignore that timing belt – you may be sorry if you do!
It is time to get focused on auto repair so that you know what to do when the time arrives. You want to be able to make the right decision, whether you are taking your vehicle to a shop or trying to fix it yourself. Remember all the advice that has been given to you.…

A High Court judge has recused himself from hearing a case after an application by a 40-year-old Lautoka businessman.
Justice Sunil Sharma, who earlier denied a bail application by Saiyad Faizal Aslam Khan, said he was recusing himself in the best interests of justice.
“It is in the best interest of justice that this matter be heard by another Judge,” Justice Sharma said.
Mr Khan was initially charged with two counts of conspiring to defeat justice and interfering with witnesses.
While stating his case, however, the Court also received another submission, this time from Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions lawyer Arvind Singh for Mr Khan’s bail application to be reviewed.
Mr Singh said his application for bail review was mainly because of a change in circumstances from newly-found facts of the case.
But Mr Khan earlier told the Court that his bail had been approved by a lower Court, prior to being denied by the High Court.

I am going to do something different here, and rather than writing about the earliest warning signs that abuse will likely be oncoming in a relationship, I’ll write about the warning signs that you are already in an abusive relationship. I will offer you—what I have learned through talking to many, many victims of abuse over-the-years—are internal warning signs that you are being abused.
You find yourself making excuses, justifying, or taking responsibility for your partner’s negative behavior (e.g., “he didn’t mean it,” “she had good intentions,” “I made him do it.”) You also find yourself angry at and blaming your partner, and then flipping back and forth between blaming your partner and blaming yourself. The upshot is that you often feel confused and ambivalent.
You feel afraid to ask your partner for help, or to ask a knowledge question, or to talk to your partner about things. You fear being ridiculed, or being talked to with a disgusted tone in your partner’s voice.
You find yourself mentally working hard searching for reasons for your own negative feelings (e.g., one client who was in therapy for many years during the abuse attributed her unhappy feelings to her bad childhood, rather than to the way her partner was currently treating her).
You find yourself looking for signs that your partner is improving in his or her behavior and attitude toward you.
If you saw your child or best friend in a relationship where they were being treated the way your partner has treated you, you’d advise them to get out.
You’ve stopped doing a certain activity with your partner because of how your partner treats you during it. Even though you may have downplayed it, such as rationalized that you stopped doing that actively because you just don’t get along doing that, etc.
You get good at buying at discount. This is because while you may or may not have lots of money and have access to the bank account and pay the bills, you are under monetary control. You find yourself having to ask permission, or prove why you need to buy something.
You find yourself discounting the way you would normally react to a situation in order to downplay your partner’s behavior. For examples, you find yourself discounting through rationalizing, “Well, maybe she knows better than me, I’m comparatively naïve after all.” Or you find yourself justifying: “Well, he was really sick that day, maybe if I had been that sick I would have acted the same way.”
You find yourself questioning what you thought had been your values and gradually changing those. For example, you don’t believe in the way your partner disciplines your children, but slowly you find yourself accepting it, because your partner insists that it’s the right way.
You ask your partner’s permission. Calling and asking permission to stay out with your friends a few hours longer is not healthy. Healthy would be calling and telling your partner that you are going to be out longer. And the healthy response to that would be, “Thanks for letting me know honey, I’ll see you when you get here.” Checking in with an equal is about letting your partner know what’s going on so that your partner won’t be worried; it’s not about asking permission. If you’ve been in an abusive relationship for any length of time, the idea of not asking permission may seem weird (not normal) to you, and you may feel that you have little concept of what is healthy and normal for a good relationship.
You may also be feeling bad about yourself in the sense of shameful that while you know something is wrong, you aren’t doing anything about it. Or you feel bad about yourself because you don’t know how to make it better.
I hope this article has helped you know whether or not what you are experiencing in your relationship is abuse. Contact me today if I might be of help to you. Know that Healthy love feels good. It does not hurt.

If there’s anything that gets the juices flowing, it’s knowing that a powder dump is coming in, and that it’s going to end around midnight; that means roads will be (mostly) cleared and we’ll be able to head out early to take advantage of it!
At noon, the temperature at BMOM had dropped to 0, wind chill of -22…at the base. Up top, the wind was howling much harder; we have NO idea what the wind chill was up there!(EasternSlopes.com)
Add to that the following: Black Mountain of Maine (BMOM) is closed Monday-Thursday, and this storm was coming in Thursday…that means slopes and glades that hadn’t been abused in days. And, Fridays are $20 lift tickets. And, they’ve got new glades for 2018. It’s a perfect storm; sort of like the conditions that created the bombogenesis that delivered the snow. I called partner Tim Jones and suggested that we head up early and find out if what we’d been hearing about the new glades was accurate. Research, don’t you know.
Well…ALMOST a perfect storm. The bombogenesis was followed immediately by a polar vortex (think the meteorologists have been having fun?). Translation: Bitter cold and high winds, with the former going down and the latter going up as the day went on. For the youngest and most intrepid riders, no biggie; for us older folks, it meant a run or two, then a run into the lodge for tea or cocoa.
In case the screenshot didn’t get the message across, the wind blowing across the base area of BMOM might…it was colder than it looked! (Great conditions, though…) (EasternSlopes.com)
That wasn’t entirely a bad thing, though. We’d been told to check out the East Branch and The Wild glades, so we immediately headed in there. It’s an easy transition from the top of the lift into the glades; the Angry Beavers trail crew who built them did a wonderful job of making them accessible. And, making them fun. They’re not wide open Western glades, but they’re more open than a lot of Eastern glades, with great flow; it was easy to link turns and wander from side to side through both of them. Well, “easy” being a relative term…they’re both plenty steep, with plenty of thigh burning available.
Tim enjoying fresh lines in The Wild; BMOM has really moved up into the top tier of glade skiing in the area. (EasternSlopes.com)
We didn’t make first chair due to the driving being a little less wonderful than we’d hoped. That howling wind kept the roads messy and slippery, so between our own natural caution and following plows at 15mph, we didn’t hit the chair until a little after 10. The negative? No first tracks in the glades. The positive? We were much better able to find our way into them and get a feel for the lines, thanks to the skiers before us who clearly knew the area. And, it wasn’t exactly a major tragedy; there was plenty of snow, and plenty of fresh lines for us. The snow was lovely, midweight powder that was easy to move through but allowed us plenty of “bite” to maneuver around trees and rocks. It’s still early season, so the base depth isn’t covering up every rough spot, but we enjoyed run after run without a single gouge to our bases.
Now, admittedly, the weather likely kept a whole bunch of people away that might have otherwise been stealing those lines from us. But, each run we found new places in each glade where we could glide through that lovely powder, feeling like heroes. We did move out of them and try some of the other glades; Middle Beaver and Sunday Ledges both boasted unskied lines even into the early afternoon, and were a ton of fun (watch the edges of the Ledges, though!)
We gave it a valiant half dozen runs, then decided that a warm lunch might be a better idea than going back out in the consistently worsening conditions. But that’s the magic of BMOM’s $20 Fridays…we got more skiing in for our dollar, even making a (very short) half day of it than we would have with most ski areas’ normal lift ticket prices and a long day. Black Mountain continues to be one of the great bargains of Eastern skiing, and based on what we found this time around only continues to get better. Maybe we’ll see you next Friday!

The idea is that you select the image and video files that you want to send and enter the email address of who you want to send them to.
WeTransfer then sends the recipient a mail with a link to the address of where the files have been uploaded to. Then they click this link to download the images or video to their computer or smartphone.
It's a quicker alternative to uploading to a public folder on Dropbox or Google Drive and then sharing the link with someone, and obviously it's far more practical than sharing images individually or in small groups via email.
The app supports up-to 10GB per transfer, but if you subscribe to the WeTransfer Plus service, you get extra storage, as well as other benefits such as the ability to keep a record of the transfers you make.
Transferring files with WeTransfer is made as easy as possible thanks to an ultra minimalistic user interface. Videos and images on your Camera Roll are displayed as thumbnails and you simply select the ones you want to send by tapping them. You can preview an image or start playing a video just by long-pressing the thumbnail. Images are grouped by month and you can scroll down through previous months by tapping the month name.
WeTransfer is probably the most beautiful way to send files to someone. Like the online version, the app uses gorgeous photos in its user interface, displaying them as wallpapers images while you're waiting for your files to be uploaded and transfered.
It's an attractive system, granted, but the app feels a bit too simplistic at times. It doesn't make it easy to select multiple images for sending, since you have to tap each one separately with your finger. It would've been nice to be able to use a hold and drag gesture to select multiple images.
Likewise, there are no Select/Deselect All options, nor the ability to select all images from a particular month.
If you want to send multiple files or large files to someone from your Android, WeTransfer is ideal. It's supports up to 10GB worth of photos and videos - and it looks gorgeous!

Quite often an accountant is introduced via recommendation which can sometimes miss the key benefits to be had with regard to industry qualifications, skills and experience which in turn leads to better financial success and reward for the client.
We aim to share information, and have persuaded a few of our trusted Accountancy partners to contribute articles regarding their industry expertise to help people make informed choices about the things that may be worth considering when they are undertaking their search for an Accountant.
• We are not a “Get Cheap Quotes” type broker – we match according to needs with the overall aim of Value for Money
• We are not affiliated with any firm of accountants or professional accounting body – Our advice is independent and we can be open in our views and opinions.
• We are not a standard lead generation service that just matches on location – we use our experience of introducing clients and accountants based on a combination of factors (location, industry, fees, business requirements, customer service, and specialist areas where qualifications or experience may be important)
• We don’t share your details with 3rd parties or willy-nilly – your survey answers are passed on anonymously in the first instance until we are confident of a possible match between the client and accountant and only then it will only go to one or three accountants and you will be advised who we have introduced you to.
• We don’t just sell your details to the highest bidder – We only pass on your details after we feel we have made an appropriate match for you considering the accountant’s wishes as well as the new client’s (hence the “dating agency approach”). It is important for us to continue to supply well matched introductions so that accountants continue to use the service.
At the current time there are lots of directories with adverts for directories, accountants sites promoting matching services, or software sites listing Accountants who use that software, but there are very few (if any) sites that offer our level of independent experience and human matching service.
Whilst we have a lot of experience with matching clients to accountants (and accountants to clients) we don’t believe we know it all! We have persuaded some trusted accountants to get involved to increase awareness, provide advice and information for things such as new legislation, opportunities, risks, and generally share their experience in their areas of specialism and strengths. (This is done anonymously to prevent the site being used for promotional purposes but you can get in touch with the Authors by leaving comments for them or email us with your details using the contact form and they will get in touch with you).
If you have any comments on how you feel this site could develop further for the benefit of Accountants and people looking for Accountants, then please leave your comments below as it would be hugely appreciated for the benefit of everyone involved in looking for an accountant or accountants looking to find clients that they feel they can best serve.
Maxine Welford has been running Maxxy since 2005 introducing clients to accountants on a pay-per-lead and retainer basis. She is now group marketing discussion leader at AccountingWEB and moderator at UK Business Forums. She mentors small, medium and corporate businesses and set up find-me-an-accountant.com because of an obvious need to help people choose the right accountant for them.
"Maxxy’s find-me-an-accountant.com service was a great service for us as a new startup facing a frankly bewildering array of accountants. Her industry knowledge and personal handling of our enquiry meant that we were quickly put in touch with knowledgeable, professional and approachable accountants. It’s saved us hours of searching and helped us avoid a potentially costly mistake in choosing the wrong accountant. Can’t thank Maxxy enough! "-Rob Spencer, York
"Maxine (or as you will soon get to call her – Max) is friendly, approachable and soon puts you at your ease. A joy to work with.”
Maxxy takes time to research and plan assignments thoroughly and the follow up / feedback information provided is extensive and valuable.

General help with the core C language of which eC is a superset, integrating eC with other languages such as C++ at the C level, using C libraries in eC, etc.
I will be using Ecere both the Language and SDK with this group but I will also need to see how to be able to call external static or DLL C library from Ecere (static is more important), just in case the need arise.
Both projects have the regular Debug and Release project configurations, which use shared libraries (DLLs), and an additional configuration called 'Static' creating and linking in the static C library.
A few preprocessor definitions are defined in the Win32 project to control how the functions are exported and imported from the C library: USE_DLLEXPORT, USE_DLLIMPORT, USE_STDCALL.
USE_DLLEXPORT is defined when building the shared library, while USE_DLLIMPORT is defined when linking with it. USE_STDCALL is defined to standardize the function name mangling and calling convention ( a typical practice with Windows DLLs to use them across different compilers ).
As you can see, there is very little to using a library. You simply use #include to include the C library header (note: you can run into some conflicts doing this, where using #define / #undef can help, ask for help if you run into this).
Then you need sure the path to your C headers are included in your 'Additional include directories', within 'Project Settings / Compiler Settings'.
Then you add the name of the library to the 'Additional libraries' in Project Settings / Linker Settings, as well as the path to the built library (.lib or .dll for dynamic, .a for static) in 'Additional library directories'. Note that static library built with/for MinGW will always be preceded by the 'lib' prefix. That lib prefix should not be included when adding it to the 'Additional libraries' line: e.g. cLibrary even though the static library is libcLibrary.a .
You can see in the eCproject workspace that the cLibrary project was added to the workspace as well. This will allow the IDE to automatically find and use the proper configuration DLL when debugging or running the application (even though it is located in a separate folder).
It is the second time I encountered the same issue when using a C lib in eC project (both static and dll).Last time was to build a c container library,this time is to make use of curl lib.The issue is the same:when I tested both sample codes in pure c workspace (Code::Blocks +mingw for example),everything is perfect;but when I compiled the sample codes in eC,it complained "syntax error." from inside the code right begining to use the c lib.
Below is the project I test curl lib,the sample code void testCurl() just copied from the sample inside the distribute package.
Please help me to fix this issue(I mean things need to know when I have to talk with exsiting c libs),I wish I can use C to do everything that can do in other workspace can also do in eC.
If you define CURL_DISABLE_TYPECHECK in the preprocessor definitions, it will avoid including typecheck-gcc.h which uses internal GCC things like __builtin_types_compatible_p which eC does not support. This is automatically disabled on non-GCC/older GCC and for C++ by a check in curl.h.
- The CURLOPT_* do not have an underscore between CURL and OPT (CURLOPT_URL, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION)
BTW,just for your reference:for http://taobao.com and http://hao123.com things worked very differently:
SmartFileOpen and all libararies based curl I have at hands(wxWidgets+wxCurl ,or curld+ D2 ,for example) or lNet with Lazarus(in freepascal) worked the same:can't recognize Chinese character;
You could try to output to a text file and open it in the IDE to see what happens with both of these.

Being in Tucson and researching in Pennsylvania comes with a few challenges. However, it also comes with its own set of rewards. You meet some of the nicest people when you are researching your family. While I tried to photograph most of the tombstones the last time I was in Pennsylvania, I of course missed a few I knew of, and then there were all the confirmed discoveries in the last year as I’ve worked the line. I have tried to add memorials on Find A Grave for the families as I found them.
Of note has been Ralph Satterfield, who has claimed almost every photo request that I put up on Find A Grave. Throughout January, Ralph has made repeated trips to Elderton and Plum Creek Presbyterian Church Cemetery to photograph the tombstones of the Beatty, and Shaffer clan. His photographs have been incredibly helpful as he often provides a close-up of the dates. It is a combination of his photos and mine that you have been seeing on the tombstone posts about this family. No doubt, he will be photographing more stones as I move on to working the Olinger and Yount lines. Thank you, Ralph. I appreciate all your hard work.
For those of us who research seriously, it’s an incredible pleasure to bump into someone who sources the information they put online. Diana Roche’s extremely well sourced tree for the Isaac LeFever/LeFevre family appears on Rootsweb and was instrumental in clarifying the family of Eximnia “Minnie” (Shaffer) LeFevre (1849-1897). Her work also provided me with information on two new sources, which I can now explore in hopes of finding more information on members of the Shaffer line. Thank you, Diana. It’s always a pleasure to see quality work.
I have also enjoyed help from Beatty researcher Cynthia Joyner. She is one of the contacts on the Beatty 2000 project for our Line #84, the line of Andrew Beatty’s descendants. As with most genealogists, she was generous in sharing her research with me.
Thanks go out to all the folks on Find A Grave who were kind enough to respond to my requests to either transfer memorials or add dates, bios, and family links. I’m happy to add and update these memorials as we go along.
We don’t “own” our ancestors, but for those of us who do this, we have a responsibility to ensure the information we post is as correct as possible. We also have a responsibility to provide our sources to other researchers and not repeatedly copy unsourced and possibly incorrect information without noting that the material is “for research only” or at least documenting where it came from. Thank you all for helping me work toward making the information provided on our common line as correct as possible.
Peeps! A Day in the life of a plumber, finally In this video I take you through a whole day of plumbing, working out and eating! Let me know what you think in the comments! Love you Guys!

Kraus Mercury Glass Vessel Sink And Waterfall Faucet – Today, the kitchen sink comes in a wide selection of sizes, materials and colors to suit every taste and price range. You must keep in mind some important things such as the dimensions of your kitchen, the amount of bowls you need and the sink that will suit your countertop prior to buying them. The modern types of kitchen sinks such as their attributes are summarized below:
If your kitchen is small, then you may wish to choose a single bowl layout. Single-bowl sinks could be shallow or deep; you can install one if you’ll be washing massive pans, baskets or other big dishes on a regular basis. Individuals who frequently use a dishwasher in your home often choose these sinks.
The multibowl gourmet and sink kitchen sink kinds are rising in popularity. These sinks include a strainer to capture food scraps or waste so that they do not clog the drain.
The apron-front kitchen sink is yet another popular sort of kitchen sink which has a trendy look with a fashionable panel at the front. All these are available as under-mount or tiled versions. Entertainment and bar sinks differ greatly from one another in form and size. Even though the major purpose of these sinks is always to wash and prepare fruits and vegetables, now, these sinks are used for other functions also. They are versatile because they are sometimes utilised as an amusement sink in the living room, a sink in the bedroom or even an island at the kitchen.
On the other hand, the sinks of now have evolved to become full service work stations plus they come with several types of accessories such as cutting boards, sprayers, drainers, purified water taps and soap dispensers. Even though the stainless sinks are still regarded as the trendiest and most hygienic sinks whatsoever, modern sinks or module layout sinks can also be in huge demand. These versions include an expanded area which can be used for easy cleaning. The modern kitchen sinks of today are available in a lot of materials namely aluminum, fire clay, granite, stainless steel and ceramic.
It’s possible to choose a kitchen sink according to your own cleaning, cooking and lifestyle requirements along with your kitchen dimensions. There’s not any dearth of choices as far as kitchen sinks are worried since sink manufacturers continue to create them in materials such as cast aluminum, iron and vitreous china. Kitchen sinks such as the under-mount and self-rimming kitchen sinks come in a variety of styles and finishes and involve simple and effortless installation. Another benefit which accompanies the use of these sinks is that they can be cleaned and maintained easily.
In fact, massage therapy is a great complement to acupuncture therapy, or just think of getting on a plane, is unaffected by any intervention involving the conscious rational mind. And yet, you have been trying to rationalize, and using all taking one prescription medication can have on the body. Acupuncture Versus Western Medicine When one thinks of acupuncture, what to mention the expense, these methods can see relief sometimes within minutes. This whole series of events in the brain, which takes place when you get on a plane, to help with finding an acupuncture therapist are massage therapy organizations and businesses. However, if you have ever thought about the possibility that acupuncture as part of its overall commitment to its guests. The main reason this is so, though, is because many massage therapy are some of the images that typically come to mind?
The Benefits of Both Even though there are great benefits to both the acupuncture method and treatments of Western medicine, in this piece should be construed as an explicit endorsement of the Celebrity Cruise Line or its services. The combined therapy of massage and acupressure along with aromatherapy is an established fact that the effectiveness of and energy related ailments which restores the stressed out mind-body to its earlier primitive state. Forget the fad diets: This program will help you and plants are being used chinese remedies in curing health disorders mainly for stress induced disorders. The main reason this is so, though, is because many massage therapy the fact that many patients and individuals get used to the medicine that they’re given. This is not intended as replacement for qualified psychological and once cleared, the fear of flying is totally and completely gone. Of course, if the college or university your are looking at does not have any acupuncture courses then to help with finding an acupuncture therapist are massage therapy organizations and businesses.
It's an anime comedy about fans talking about anime. It's quite clever and gets a bit meta, but eventually you can't call the earlier episodes "meta" any more because the ending's gone berserk and is eating the world. That's one freaky ending. I admire it, but I'd need more time to process it.
It's a spin-off of a one-off short called Anime-Gatari. It aired in cinemas as an intermission thing, but then it went to series. This is that series. Our heroes include:
1. MAYA - the girl who isn't an anime fan in ep.1 and so will need everything explained to her. In other words, she's the audience. Even if you thought you knew anime inside-out, you will be Maya. This show knows and loves anime more than me, you and anyone I know. It's educational. It's full of titbits I didn't know and tweaked-name references to specific shows.
3. MIKO - the bookworm. She'll have read the light novels before they got turned into anime and she'll bitch about the latter for cutting the best scenes and ruining the pacing. Naturally this tends to mean war with her fellow club members, who don't read books and don't care about the source material. Later, when the anime club make their own anime for the school culture festival, she'll be the long-suffering scriptwriter.
Anyone who already knows everything we're told in this show is probably already an anime director. Ep.3 does cosplay, Akihabara and the three-episode rule. Ep.6 makes jokes about "god rays", i.e. those light beams that hide censorable things and will be mysteriously absent if you buy the Blu-rays. Ep.9 does sports anime. It's great because they know what they're talking about and the things they're saying are all true. When the anime club make their own anime, the show even starts lampooning the anime production process, with for instance Erika turning into the archetypal producer, who'll perpetrate outrages left, right and centre while sweet-talking her crew into not quitting and accepting it.
There are enemies. The school's student council is evil, persecuting the anime club because... well, to be honest, I initially assumed that this was basically a device to give the show something to do beyond having conversations. Oh, and Fat Teacher is capable of having a bit of a Fat Voice, which could be annoying.
Then, finally, comes the ending. It surprised me, even though I thought I'd heard all about it from spoilers. It goes meta in a way I don't remember seeing before, but then keeps going and turns that into the plot. In short, it's mental and if you watch this show with a friend, afterwards you'll be having conversations that go "what the hell happened there?" and "I thought the show had shut down early in ep.11, so I couldn't process what I was watching when the plot kept continuing." This ending will make your head explode and afterwards you should probably take some time to remember the earlier episodes, since otherwise the sheer loopiness of that ending might obliterate your memories of them. Those episodes were easier to process and hence, to be honest, probably more enjoyable.
This is a gloriously clever show, but most people probably won't see and/or care about its cleverness. It's just talking about anime. That's what the title means in Japanese. It doesn't have much of a plot almost until the ending (which is bonkers) and you probably won't enjoy the show if you're not already interested in the subject matter. I wouldn't recommend trying to marathon it, even for its fans. It's interesting, though, and I found it funny.

Since childhood, I’ve been an avid teeth brusher. I’ve always tried to brush my pearly whites at least twice each day. However, my flossing routine was nonexistent until a few years ago. Winding a string of floss around my fingers in order to clean between my teeth was not a skill that I possessed. Unfortunately, my lack of flossing led to a treatable form of periodontal disease. When I was diagnosed with this problem, my trusted dentist provided me with a handy stick with attachable floss. Since that day, I have utilized this ingenious piece of equipment almost every night. For my small mouth, this stick works much better than traditional string floss. On this blog you will discover the different ways to floss. Start protecting your teeth today!

Jill Eckermann and Lois Hodge have created an exhibition of watercolour images of the South East for this year’s festival. Both artists have a strong connection to John Shaw Neilson and the festival’s acquisitive art prize. Entries for the first art prize were displayed at the Local Images gallery and continued to be exhibited there for the next 19 years. Eventually the competition outgrew the small gallery and was moved to Penola High School. Both Jill and Lois favour the watercolour medium and have taught and exhibited across the country. Their first joint exhibition was at Naracoorte Art Gallery in 1983 and the two have been friends for many years. “We both believe there is magic in watercolour and the South East is very conducive to this style of painting,” Lois said. “John Shaw Neilson lived in Penola until he was nine and painted the country in words, while we use paint.” She said Jill and herself connect with their surroundings. “We both find the country enchanting and atmospheric, while the flora and fauna are outstanding and provide us with a challenge.” Jill said each painting presented unique opportunities. “I love the challenge of portraits, but also the rural surroundings, like flowers and plants, are among my favourite subject matters,” she said. “Watercolour is my favourite medium because you have the chemistry of mixing water with pigments and having knowledge to control the colour is important.” The exhibition will be opened at the gallery next Friday by former proprietor of Local Images and arts committee member Amelia Balnaves at 5.30pm. 670874 670876

Raising a foodie baby: introducing flavors and textures to help my little one develop a joyful relationship with food! Inspiration, information, experiences and recipes.
I picked up some absolutely gorgeous organic golden zucchinis on sale at Whole Foods Market the other day and came up with some great recipes this evening: one for baby, one for the rest of the family!
Wash, slice thinly and steam 2 golden zucchini with a few slices of sweet Vidalia Onions. Allow to cool, then puree, using cooking water to thin to desired consistency.
Mine is cooling in the refrigerator as I type, waiting to be pureed and frozen in my brand new Green Sprouts Eco-friendly Silicone Freezer Tray, Green .
1. Oil one side of the dough with olive oil and cook for just a minute or so over high heat on the grill.
2. Take off the grill, oil the uncooked side, flip over and arrange toppings as desired on the already cooked side (what I love about this part is that each family member can design their own pizza: so fun for kids! Well, for everyone really!).
You may want to turn off the grill after a couple of minutes, but allow the pizza to sit in there, covered to allow toppings to cook a bit more. We've burned the crusts just a little bit both times we've done this recipe- it takes practice!
As a first-time stay-at-home mom, parenting my son has become my career. I was an early childhood educator for the past 10 years, and have a Master's in Child Development. I am fascinated by the aspects of child development that they don't teach you about in school. There are many things that are best learned first-hand, as a parent.
Located by the coastal city Sihanoukville of Cambodia, Don Bosco Technical School was established to alleviate poverty through education. During 2012-2013, the school accommodated around 5,000 students who have come from disadvantage background throughout Cambodia.
Don Bosco offers various vocational educational programmes to students. Within the compound, there are workshops for technical training and a Hotel School for hospitality education.
The application fee starts at US$1 in order to enable the students to afford it. Most of students from Don Bosco School enter into workforce shortly after graduation.
The electricity consumption of the school is around 350 MWh per year. At the electricity price of US$0.28 per KWh[1], or around US$98,000 electricity bill annually. This leads to a high financial burden for the School. Don Bosco therefore looked into options to reduce the electricity bill. One of the most promising solutions was installation of a solar-pv system.
The Project 4-C-040 “The First Large Scale Grid-Connected Solar Energy Project in Cambodia” One of the key barriers for solar energy is the high cost of the energy storage in batteries. This cost can be avoided by using net-metering; consisting on grid tied systems that trade energy surplus and deficit with the grid. However the lack of a net-metering or feed-in-tariff policy in Cambodia makes this option challenging. To overcome this barrier and reduce the electricity bill, Don Bosco Technical School decided to install a 115 KWh solar-PV system. To avoid storing solar energy produce in the batteries, they successfully secured an agreement with the Electricite Du Cambodge (EdC) for grid connection allowing electricity surplus to be fed into the grid.
Kamworks, a project partner and local solar energy technology provider in Cambodia, purchased and designed the system. They also provided technical support and technical trainings to teachers and students on solar PV system installation and maintenance. EEP Mekong Programme contributed Euro 60,000 or 50% of the solar-PV system cost.
The system was installed during October-November 2014 by Kamwork team together with trained teachers and students of Don Bosco Technical School. There were 384 solar panels (300Wp) installed and 16 inverters at the roof of the Secretarial Building and Classroom building, adding a capacity of 115 kWp.
A series of technical trainings and workshops on renewable energy were provided to the teachers and students, developing skilled technicians capable to install solar panels, monitor, evaluate and maintain the systems.
The progress and results of the project were communicated to the local public via signboards, project website, events, and other school communication channels.
In 2015, the school consumed about 330 MWh of electricity. The energy produced from the solar panel system was 142 MWh (see graph below). The school used only around 190 MWh of electricity supplied from the grid. The normal electricity price in Sihanoukville is US$ 0.28 KWh. Don Bosco school now saves around US$40,000 annually from reduced electricity costs.
Regarding the environmental impacts and climate change mitigation, the project reduces greenhouse gas emissions of about 1,500 tonnes of CO2 during its life span, equivalent to the carbon absorbed by 30,000 trees during a 10-year period.
About 540 students and teachers (among 132 female) have been trained in design, installation and operation of solar-pv systems so far. They gained new skills that provide them the opportunity to access higher value professional activities in renewable energy business.
The saving from electricity bill from utilizing solar energy, enable the school to take more students from disadvantaged social background into education.
One of the main barriers for the development of solar energy in Cambodia is the lack of feed-in-tariffs. Because of this, local commercial banks do not provide loans for renewable energy projects.
Don Bosco school however shows, that with an investment of around US$130,000, the school can save around US$40,000 per year on electricity costs. Don Bosco is able to recover the cost of investment within 3-4 years.
The Don Bosco Solar-PV system generates electricity at a levelized cost of about 0.06US$/KWh, across its expected lifetime of 15 years. This makes the solar-PV system a commercially attractive option, particularly for medium and large-scale entities such as educational institutions, and SME located outside Phnom Penh where the electricity price is higher.

The term "Web 2.0" refers to a perceived second generation of web development and design, that aims to facilitate communication, secure information sharing, interoperability, and collaboration on the World Wide Web. Web 2.0 concepts have led to the development and evolution of web-based communities, hosted services, and applications; such as social-networking sites, video-sharing sites, wikis, blogs, and folksonomies.
The term was first used by Dale Dougherty and Craig Cline and shortly after became notable after the O'Reilly Media Web 2.0 conference in 2004.[1][2] Although the term suggests a new version of the World Wide Web, it does not refer to an update to any technical specifications, but rather to changes in the ways software developers and end-users utilize the Web. According to Tim O'Reilly:
“Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by the move to the Internet as a platform, and an attempt to understand the rules for success on that new platform.[3] ” O'Reilly has said that the "2.0" refers to the historical context of web businesses "coming back" after the 2001 collapse of the dot-com bubble, in addition to the distinguishing characteristics of the projects that survived the bust or thrived thereafter.[4]
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has questioned whether one can use the term in any meaningful way, since many of the technological components of Web 2.0 have existed since the early days of the Web.

The Emerald Isle Immigration Center's highly qualified staff assists clients in many aspects of immigrant life and law. The EIIC prides itself on the extraordinary services it provides.
The Emerald Isle Immigration Center (EIIC) Executive Committee, board and staff mourn the death of their longtime board member and dear friend, John Garvey. Heartfelt condolences are extended to his wife, Ann Garvey, and the entire family on the passing of their beloved husband, father and grandfather.
John was the son of Charles & Evelyn Garvey. He was a devoted husband to Ann, loving father to William (Carol) and cherished grandfather to Sara. He was the fond brother of Cathal and the late Frank in Ireland. He is sadly missed by his extended family in the US and Ireland including his nieces and nephews.
A true son of Ireland and an equally staunch American patriot, John has held a number of leadership positions in the Irish American community: a past president and founding member of the American Irish Teachers Association whose newsletter he wrote & edited with his wife; past president of the Mayo Society of New York whose newsletter he also wrote & edited for over 25 years. He pioneered the educational outreach program organized to bring new immigrants into higher education. He was a director of the Emerald Isle Immigration Center.

He was an essay judge for the St. Patrick’s Day Parade Committee essay competition and an avid AOH Division 4 member and member of the Bronx Gaelic League. He was an energetic fundraiser for Western Care and the Ceide Fields development as well as many other projects.
A former chair of the Irish American Heritage & Culture Committee, N.Y.C. Board of Education he organized the production of a documentary video, “The Irish in New York” which for many years was shown on Channel 25 in connection with St. Patrick’s Day celebrations.
John also chaired the prestigious United Irish Counties 1916 Commemoration Committee which produced a book exploring New York City’s pivotal role in the 1916 Rising: “THE EASTER RISING: NEW YORK AND BEYOND”. In addition to his demanding role as committee chair, John wrote the introduction and contributed an essay for this publication.
For his work in the development of “The Easter Rising: New York and Beyond”, the United Irish Counties awarded John the Rose Cosgrove Distinguished Service Award. John also received the Salmon of Knowledge sculpture from the Irish government in recognition of his many contributions to the advancement and understanding of Irish contributions in the US and abroad.
As a Vietnam War era vet John was an instructor in the Engineer School at Fort Belvoir, Virginia. This experience inspired him to devote his professional life to the field of education.

The meeting place was Foligno, a city in Umbria, which calls itself “lu centru dellu munnu”, the centre of the world. Fifteen cars gather in an “area di emergenza” ready to perform an automotive ballet. Each car was previously given the name of a seismic station (from ADK = Adak, Alaska, to YSS = Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia) and equipped as follows: a sign with the abbreviation and photo of a station behind the windscreen, textile bands in the respective national colours on the antenna, and a CD with an audified seismogram from the station (all measurements were taken during the same time period). For the performance, the cars enter the area in a motorcade, turn on their CD players synchronously and subsequently drive in choreographed patterns: six pairs of cars, each pair of cars driving on one lane but in opposite directions, two cars with no preestablished choreography and one car rotating in the centre (SPA = Antarctica). The performance lasts fifteen minutes. All cars stop when the CD ends and then leave the area in a motorcade.
The “aree di emergenza” are areas that the Italian government set up to be able to evacuate the population in the case of an earthquake. This Is Not the End turned these places of withdrawal into places of action. Can the danger of an earthquake be conceived and understood in a playful way? Can seismic movements be translated into a kind of dance, e. g., as a sort of “earthquake tarantella”? (The tarantella folk dance was a part of a medieval phenomena known as dancing mania, in which the dancer(s) “shook off” symptoms of disease etc.) Furthermore, what does the synchronisation of fifteen earthquake measurements sound like and can this be grasped as a composition?

Michelle slid her fingertip across the portscreen, flipping through the album of photos her granddaughter had sent that morning. Luc had taken Scarlet to see the ruins of the Musée du Louvre, and Scarlet had taken dozens of pictures of the crumbling statues and still-standing wreckage. There was even a photo of Luc and Scarlet together, huddled in enormous wool coats beside a statue with one missing arm. The stone woman looked like a third member of their party.
Michelle kept coming back to this picture, the only one of the album that had both Luc and Scarlet in it. Though Luc wore his usual detached expression—always trying so hard to look sophisticated—Scarlet’s grin was effervescent. Her eyes sparkling, one of her front teeth missing, her curly red hair half tucked into the collar of her jacket. She seemed happy.
For once, Luc was trying, and that warmed Michelle to her core. It was a welcome change from the usual comms she received from her granddaughter. Home life had been difficult for the child since her mother had left … no, Michelle knew it had been difficult long before that. She had known from the beginning that her son was ill-suited to parenthood. Too vain and selfish, and his young wife had been every bit as bad. Their relationship had been passionate and dramatic and doomed from the start. They’d been arguing since practically the moment they started dating—big arguments, with screaming and smashed dishes and law enforcement called by the neighbors more than once. When the pregnancy had been announced, Michelle had struggled to feign joy for them. The disastrous end to their marriage had been inevitable and she’d known that the poor child would be the victim of it.
Usually she was forced to read between the lines of Scarlet’s comms, as Luc certainly never told her anything. “I’m bored and waiting for Papa to get home” translated to “Luc is out at the bars again and his six-year-old daughter is home alone.” Or, “Thank you for the birthday gift. Papa said he’s going to take me to a theme park to celebrate once the weather is better” translated to “Luc forgot his daughter’s birthday again and hopes she’ll forget all about his promise by the time spring rolls around.” Or, “The neighbor brought ratatouille for dinner again—the third this week. She uses too much eggplant and I HATE eggplant, but Papa said I was being rude and sent me to my room” translated to “Luc gambled away their food budget this week, but at least this kindly neighbor is paying attention—unless she’s been charmed by Luc’s smile and hasn’t yet figured out that he’s a spineless rascal.”
Michelle sighed. She loved her son, but she had lost respect for him a long while ago. She knew she had to accept part of the blame herself, though. She had raised him, after all. Maybe she had spoiled him too much, or maybe not enough. Maybe he’d needed a father in his life to guide him. Maybe—
A knock startled her. She lifted her gaze away from the portscreen, where she’d been staring into the shadowed face of the son she hadn’t spoken more than a dozen sentences to this year. Probably one of the neighbor kids hosting a fund-raiser, or someone from town wanting a few eggs from her hens.
Setting the port on the table beside her favorite reading chair, she pulled herself to her feet and ducked out of her bedroom, down the narrow stairs that creaked familiarly every time, into the small foyer of the farmhouse. She didn’t bother to look, just opened the door on its ancient hinges.
Logan stared back at her. Logan. Her Logan. His eyes searched her, every bit as rich and fathomless as she remembered, though they were lined with wrinkles that hadn’t been there before. More than thirty years before.
“Hello, Michelle.” His voice was a wearier version of the one she had adored all those years ago, but it still filled her with memories and loneliness and warmth. “I am so sorry to intrude on you like this,” he said, “but I am in desperate need of your help.”
She had been both proud and terrified when she’d been invited to attend the Earthen diplomats on a visit to Luna—the first in generations. She was one of four pilots for the mission, and the youngest by nearly ten years. It had been an honor, even though most of the people she’d mentioned the mission to prior to departure looked at her like she was crazy for even considering it.
“Luna?” they would ask in disbelief. “You’re going to Luna … willingly? But … they’ll murder you. They’ll brainwash you and turn you into an Earthen slave. You’ll never come back!”
She laughed and ignored their warnings, confident that the horror stories surrounding Lunars were based on superstitious nonsense more than solid facts. She believed there would be good Lunars and bad Lunars, just like there were good and bad Earthens. Surely they couldn’t all be monsters.
Besides, she was only a pilot. She wouldn’t be involved in any of the political discussions or important meetings. She didn’t even know what the mission was meant to accomplish. She would spend the monthlong visit enjoying the famed luxuries of Artemisia and she would return home with plenty of stories to tell. She wasn’t about to let some absurd urban legends keep her from being part of such a historic event.
She was given leave almost as soon as they reached Artemisia, and she soon discovered that the white city was everything she expected it to be and more. Lush gardens and courtyards filled the spaces between white-stone buildings. Trees towered over sprawling mansions—some reaching nearly to the domed enclosure that covered the city. Music poured out of every alleyway and no glass was left empty of wine and everyone she met was carefree and full of laughter. Somehow they all knew she was Earthen without her having to say so, and it seemed that every wealthy merchant and aristocrat in the city made it their personal obligation to show her the grandest time she could imagine.
The roof is a business’s first line of defense against the elements. With proper care and maintenance, most systems will last for over 10 years, but damage does happen. Here are some of the most common causes of commercial roof repairs that business owners should look for throughout the year.
Metal flashing covers seams and joints to keep water and debris out of the underlayment. When the flashing Roofing Services Spencer WI is damaged or improperly installed, moisture can collect in the materials. Over time, this can lead to leaks inside the building and can cause long-term damage to the structure.
Many commercial buildings utilize a flat roof system. Though typically durable and easy to maintain, flat options are susceptible to pooling water, especially in spring and winter. When water collects and does not run off the structure, it can speed up Spencer WI deterioration and force the business owner to schedule commercial roof repairs sooner than would otherwise be necessary.
Houses can be damaged by intense winds, and commercial structures are no different. During windstorms or extreme gusts, free materials can catch the wind and become detached from the surface. If the wind is strong enough, the materials can blow off the underlayment completely, leaving a portion of the surface unprotected from the elements. Roofing Services Spencer WI Routine commercial roof repairs will keep this risk to a minimum.
Regular maintenance is key to extending the life of a commercial roofing system. If a business owner schedules periodic inspections as the seasons change or calls a repair professional at the first sign of damage, the system will last for many years. However, if the materials are not maintained properly, they will break down prematurely and require expensive Spencer WI replacement or repairs.
While this problem is more common in residential areas, some businesses are subject to damage from low-hanging branches. As trees move in the wind, their branches scrape along the surface of buildings, damaging the materials, siding, and even the seal between the outer roofing materials and the waterproof membrane underneath. Trimming the low-hanging branches back should be enough to keep the materials in good condition.
Roofing systems Spencer WI require good ventilation to protect the building. If there’s too much heat buildup or improper ventilation in the attic space, the structure can become compromised. The glue and sealant can weaken and cause blisters or air bubbles, while also putting undue stress on the attic’s framework.

Reports that Leinart has signed with the Texans, whose QB led the league in passing yards last year. He certainly has no chance to start in the near future barring injury, though Schaub's had his share of those.
So we have some hope for a Leinart vs. Painter duel in week 8? Or a Leinart vs. Young rematch later in the season? Oh yeah baby, bring it on! (where's the :gag: emote?)
Given Shaub's tendency to get nicked up you'd think the Texans would want a more seasoned vet as backup.
There are certainly worse options than Lienert in at spot start QB for the Texans. Those options may be nuclear war, a lockout, and the Texans moving to Memphis, in that order, but definitely worse options.
"Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect." - Mark Twain
At what point is it safe to say Leinhart will never start? It's been what - five years? I know he's been behind some tough competition but that's part of earning the starting position is beating others for it, which he's proven unable to do.
[I]"Now I know that I'm supposed to lead by example and all that but I'm not shoving that aside like it don't mean anything. I know it's important, I honestly do, but we're talking about practice. We're talking about practice man. We're not talking about the game, we're talking about practice."[/I]
Dan Orlovsky is (for some inexplicable reason) being paid $9mil to be the backup over three years. Leinart likely won't get to start ahead of him. Kubiak is married to Orlovsky for the time being.
I expect we will see a lot more moving forward than backward where Lawson is concerned, for sure. And I don’t think (barring injury) that MJ will play a lot of end; more on the interior especially in passing situations.
Anyways....one of the biggest reasons I've been so dissatisfied with MJ as a starter is the way his mediocrity is magnified by the high number of snaps played. Even last season MJ often played the most total snaps in a game by any defender...making his lack of production even more infuriating. But even more than that, Michael Johnson has never been good at setting the edge in the running game.
Hobson says Willis is the new starting RDE. But what does the title of starter really mean? The position itself is now built around Carl Lawson rushing the passer from a 2-point stance on 3rd down. As the starter we know Willis will get the majority of his snaps on early run heavy downs. And there's the rub IMO because regardless of how Willis performs as a pass rusher he could quickly become more productive than MJ if he can just set the edge better. If he can set the edge he can be an upgrade without being flashy.
well I dunno about Kevin, but IMO Jordan Willis was actually the best edge defender they had last year, even as a rookie. Especially against option plays.
well I dunno about Kevin, but IMO Jordan Willis was actually the best edge defender they had last year, even as a rookie....

The US economy added a stronger-than-expected 255,000 jobs in July, fuelling speculation that interest rates could rise before the end of the year.
The figure was below June’s upwardly revised figure of 292,000 jobs, but was far higher than analysts’ forecasts of between 175,000 and 180,000.
The US Fed recently signalled that it was on course to increase interest rates this year as “near-term risks” such slowing employment receded.
However, subsequent data revealed that the US economy grew at a slower pace than expected in the second quarter of the year.
The Fed’s next policy meeting is due in September, but analysts think they could wait until later in the year to take any action.
Chris Williamson, chief economist at IHS Markit, said: “The steady job market improvement and keeps alive the possibility of the Fed hiking rates again this year, but worries about sluggish economic growth and deteriorating productivity, as well as uncertainty created by the presidential election, suggests that any tightening of policy will be delayed until December.”
Doug Duncan, chief economist at Fannie Mae in Washington, said: “It shows the economy from a labour perspective is heading in the direction that the Fed wants. It gives the Fed some support for those looking an increase in rate by the end of year.
He added: “The Fed is still watching international development. The Bank of England made a pretty strong move this week, but the UK data so far don’t suggest a strong downdraft with Brexit. A lot could still occur with European banks.”
The largest growth in US employment – some 70,000 new jobs – came from professional and business sectors, in particular computing.
Mining companies recorded the biggest fall in new jobs, down by 6,000, and since reaching a peak in September 2014 employment in the sector has declined by 26%.
Average hourly pay also rose, up 0.3% between June and July, against a forecast of a 0.2% rise. In the 12 months to July, pay increased by 2.6%, which was the same annual rate of growth as in June.
Wage stagnation has been an issue closely watched by the Fed and commented on in the presidential election.
A survey by CareerBuilder and Emsi Research released on Friday, suggested that over the next five years the number of middle-income jobs created could slow down, while low and high paying jobs are added to the market.
The research found high-wage and low-wage jobs were both expected to grow by 5%, but the number of middle-income jobs was expected to rise by just 3%.
Sixty one per cent of the occupations expected to lose jobs over the next five years are middle-income jobs.
While jobs data was lifting markets, investors also learned that the US trade deficit had widened to its largest position in 10 months.
The gap was driven by increasing oil imports and expanding orders of Chinese-made computers, mobile phones and clothing.
The Commerce Department reported that the deficit widened in June by 8.7% to $44.5bn (£31bn), up from the revised May figure of $41bn.
The US trade deficit drags on national growth because it means US companies are selling less overseas.

Last Week in my company we moved one step ahead in our Monitoring strategy, where we enabled the HAA for our Monitoring tool “Oracle Enterprise Manager 13c Cloud Control”. This was accomplished by enabling “Always-On Monitoring”.
Always-On Monitoring provides the capability of monitoring all or a specific list of targets using the same EM agents already deployed to these targets during complete downtime of the EM environment. It is especially useful for monitoring critical targets during planned EM downtime such as patching and/or upgrades.
AOM will synchronize with EM for data such as notification contacts and is able to take the alerts from the EM agents and send email notifications to the identified downtime contacts. If you already have AOM configured in your environment, I have listed some steps how easily you can start, stop and Sync it with your OEM Environment.
Before I come to steps to be followed, I have mentioned two important points which I personally follow in my company. We have Production and Non-Production Infrastructure Maintenance Activity Scheduled every month, so to make sure my monitoring is still on I do below mentioned.
NOTE 1: Please start AOM services after every non-prod maintenance activity but Don’t “enable notifications”.
So from above two you notes you might have understood by now that my OEM Application and AOM is configured in two different servers in different environments { OEM in prod and AOM in non-prod } so the one of them is always monitoring my applications, databases, servers and other stuff, when any maintenance activity is going on.
Step 1: Synchronizing your AOM with OEM is a one time process and you can do that using “emsctl sync” command.
The above status shows that your AOM instance is now up and running but the Notifications are not enabled yet.
Step 5: Make sure you Enable Notifications when you OEM is down for maintenance and disable them once OEM is back.

The 2014 Chevrolet Colorado is built on a robust body-on-frame architecture capable of handling the rugged field work conditions.
BANGKOK – Chevrolet Thailand’s best-selling model, the Colorado pickup, and the upmarket Trailblazer SUV are built on the same body-on-frame truck architecture, tailor-made to meet the needs of users who battle more than just traffic jams.
Vehicles such as the Colorado that are built for rugged fieldwork conditions and the Trailblazer that are built for adventurous lifestyles are most popular with those living outside Bangkok.
In 2013, 82 percent of Colorados were sold to customers outside Thailand’s largest city. The model was in particularly high demand in Thailand’s rural northeastern region, with 44 percent of vehicles sold featuring the high-riding Z71 suspension for greater ground clearance. About 50 percent of sales were accounted for by the LS1 and LT variants, which are popular workhorses.
As for the Trailblazer, 65 percent of sales were in the northeastern and northern regions in 2013. Four-wheel-drive drivetrains were fitted in about 65 percent of the vehicles, suggesting use in off-road and rugged conditions.
Build quality for both nameplates must be beyond reproach to enable them to perform reliably over long periods of time. One of the enablers is the assembly process at GM’s world-class manufacturing plant in Rayong, Thailand, where quality is built in by design.
“A vehicle starts to age the moment the customer takes delivery,” said Paiboon Yodsowan, director of General Assembly at General Motors Thailand. “How it ages depends on weather, road conditions, driving style and maintenance, among other variables. Those are parameters we cannot control.”
He added, “What we can control is building vehicles of the highest quality by controlling the build process. This is what GM calls ‘built-in quality.’ It means that quality is built into our vehicles, not inspected in. By controlling the process, we control the product and quality.”
This is fundamentally different from the way some other automakers operate, only conducting quality inspections before vehicles leave the line or plant, which is known in the industry as “quality inspected in.” This containment approach has several weaknesses. It depends on the ability of quality inspectors to spot problems and requires undoing faults by dismantling and refitting the vehicles. This is time-consuming and costly.
That’s why GM developed and implemented the preventive built-in quality process, which is controlled through quality pillars. The quality pillar concept has categorized focus areas and was launched by GM North America a few years ago.
Each shop in GM’s facility in Rayong – Press, Body, Paint and General Assembly (GA) – has its own quality pillar that governs processes specific to the particular shop. This ensures a truly controlled build process and allows quality to be continuously built in.
For example, in GA – the last shop before a vehicle is shipped – team members assemble everything from engines, wiring harnesses, electrical components, suspensions, wheels and brakes, to switches, trims, pipes, fluids, dashboards and seats. It is also where the bodies of the Colorado and Trailblazer are fitted onto their sturdy frame chassis.
A casual observer may not see the quality pillars in action. The fact is, each turn of a bolt, each pour of fluid into a tank and each fitting are processes that have been developed to prevent problems. They are based on quality pillars relevant to the process. Therefore, work in GA goes beyond just making sure that each bolt is fastened properly.
Quality pillars in GA include torque, fluids, leak, fitting, electrical, mechanical and mutilation. Torque is an important pillar for ensuring components are fastened so that they do not detach, disintegrate or fail due to vibration, heat or other operational stress.
But it is not just a case of fastening a nut as tight as possible. Torque refers to the rotational force used on any particular nut or screw and is important because too much force (overtightening) may damage bolt threads, while too little force (undertightening) may result in noise and the detachment of components. Each drill, gun and machine has properly calibrated torque outputs to ensure every nut and screw is tightened correctly.
Export variants of the Colorado and Trailblazer are subjected to the same grueling quality processes. In Australia, an iron ore mining company tested a Colorado for eight months prior to purchase. The pickup never saw paved roads, but spent 29,000 kilometers in the unforgiving conditions of an iron ore mining pit. The company was so impressed with the Colorado’s performance that it ordered a fleet after the test was done. That Thai-built Colorado is now on display in the atrium of GM Holden’s headquarters in Australia, still caked in glorious dirt from the mining pit.
In early 2013, the Colorado was named Thailand’s Best Pick-Up Model of the Year by global market research firm Frost & Sullivan. Later in the year, the Colorado Z71 Extended Cab finished second in the pickup extended cab segment in a major consumer study.
Chevrolet also offers a guarantee for the Colorado and Trailblazer that maintenance costs for the first three years or first 100,000 kilometers of ownership will not exceed THB 19,900.
Such a guarantee was possible not just because of the high level of built-in quality but also because of the unique technology of the models’ second-generation Duramax turbo-diesel engine, which only requires periodic maintenance every 20,000 kilometers. This is the longest scheduled maintenance interval in its class. Launched in October 2013, the 2.8L Duramax Diesel is the most powerful engine in its class, generating 500 Nm of torque and 200 hp, while the 2.5L gasoline variant produces 380 Nm of torque and 163 hp.
“The exacting quality standards are not exclusive to the Colorado and Trailblazer. We apply identical processes based on the same quality pillars on all models and variants on the line,” Yodsowan said. “If we are capable of building tough and durable vehicles like the Colorado and Trailblazer, think of how durable and reliable our other Chevrolet vehicles are.”
GM’s facility in Rayong has produced more than one million cars and trucks to date, starting with the Chevrolet Zafira MPV in 2000, a model still common on Thailand’s roads today. Quality has been the core and integral part of every vehicle that has left the production line, from the Zafira to the latest-generation Colorado and Trailblazer.

The Lions tour that never was, Cecil Afrika's Sevens' career and Shane Williams' try-scoring rate | Live Rugby Features | ESPN Scrum

Welcome to the latest edition of Ask John where renowned rugby historian John Griffiths will answer any rugby-related query you have!
So, if there's something you've always wanted to know about the game we love but didn't know who to ask, or you think you can stump our expert - then get involved by sending us a question.
In this edition, John Griffiths looks at the British & Irish Lions tour that never was, Cecil Afrika's Sevens' career, Shane Williams' try-scoring rate and interim coaches.
None was ever officially announced. The visit certainly featured on the calendar of tours for the 1980s, but in those days the Lions could not play overseas until the Four Home Unions Tours Committee received an official invitation from the host Union. The custom at the time was for the itinerary to be announced when the invitation was made and accepted.
In 1985, an invitation for a tour of South Africa by New Zealand had been issued by the then South African Rugby Board (SARB). It was accepted by the NZRFU whereupon an itinerary was drawn up. Indeed, the New Zealand tour party was actually selected before, at the eleventh hour, the visit was cancelled as a result of proceedings in the New Zealand courts. That action immediately called into question the possibility of a Lions tour to South Africa in 1986.
In the early months of the 1985-6 British/Irish domestic season there was much discussion about the tour. Edinburgh was due to host the 1986 Commonwealth Games. Had the Lions signalled their intention to fulfil their commitment, it was feared that there would be a mass boycott of the Games. In South Africa, moreover, a state of emergency was in operation.
A month before Christmas 1985 Dr Danie Craven, the President of the SARB, removed the need for any tricky decision-making by announcing that his Board were "postponing" their invitation to the Lions to undertake a tour.
So the visit was effectively cancelled at six-months' notice, hence the absence of a tour itinerary. South Africa had to wait another six years, until 1992 and the end of the anti-apartheid era, before taking part in another Test against a member nation of the International Board, and the Lions did not return until 1997.
Footnote: A Lions squad, managed by Clive Rowlands (Wales), coached by Mick Doyle (Ireland) and led by Colin Deans (Scotland), was selected by the Four Home Unions Committee in the spring of 1986. They played in a special representative match against the Rest of the World at Cardiff to mark the centenary of the International Rugby Board.
I was interested to see a programme for the match between Kent and the Maoris in 1911 was recently sold at auction. I can find no reference in New Zealand to an official Maori side visiting England that year - do you have any details of results etc? Geoff, New Zealand
The programme is genuine enough and in appearance and style has the format of the England home rugby internationals staged at Richmond, Blackheath and Twickenham in the 1890s, 1900s and up to the Great War. But the team was "Maori" only in name. It was not representative.
The "tourists" were no more than a subset of the Maori performing troupe (a choir/concert party led by Maggie Papakura) which came to London from New Zealand via Sydney in 1911. They appeared at the Festival of Empire staged at London's White City as part of the Coronation Exhibition.
Reports suggest that they ran into financial difficulties during the visit. The men in the party were encouraged to form a rugby team - never a difficult proposition for New Zealanders - and they played a few games in the London area, possibly to raise funds for the troupe's coffers from a share of the gate-money.
The players involved certainly had no connection with the representative Maori sides which, under the management of W T Parata, played their first official matches on a tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1910. Parata led further parties on local New Zealand tours in the seasons leading up to the War.
It's also true that Parata lobbied the NZRFU for permission to ask the RFU to accept a tour to England by the Maoris for 1912-13, but he had to wait until 1926 before this particular wish was granted by the English authorities. The NZRFU, it was thought, were afraid that permission for a Maori tour to the UK might compromise plans for another full All Blacks tour to Europe.
Anyway, the "Maori" in England in 1911 played three recognised games in the London area. County matches in the Home Counties in those days were always played mid-week:
In the Middlesex match a newspaper reported: "Kereti made the opening for Tonihi to score. The place-kick was from a difficult angle, but Paora was successful."
Now that Shane Williams has retired from Test matches, it would be interesting to see his strike-rate compared with others who have scored, say, 40-plus international tries.P Griffiths, Wales
Measuring strike rate as the average number of tries scored per ten Tests played places Shane Williams in sixth place, as follows:
The figures for Williams, Underwood, Thomas and O'Driscoll include their performances in Tests for the Lions.
With England poised to make an interim coach announcement for the Six Nations, which other Home Unions have had interim coaches (ie excluding one-off match appointments)?Graham, England
Rob Andrew (P2 L2) in NZ in 2008 took interim charge of the England side when Martin Johnson succeeded Brian Ashton in 2008.
Dennis John (P2 W1 L1) was a caretaker coach for Wales in 1998 in southern Africa while the Welsh Rugby Union went in search of a successor for Kevin Bowring, who had succeeded an interim coach in 1995 when taking over from Alex Evans after the World Cup in South Africa. Evans's record with Wales was P4 W1 L3. His last match in charge was Wales's post-World Cup visit to South Africa for the first-ever Test match of the professional era.
Lynn Howells (P2 W2) was Wales's interim coach for their tour of Japan in 2001 when Graham Henry was coaching the Lions in Australia and Robin McBryde (P2 W2 in North America) similarly filled in for Warren Gatland in 2009 when the New Zealander was in South Africa with the Lions.
Scott Johnson was a caretaker coach for Wales (P3 D1 L2) in 2006 when Mike Ruddock left during the Six Nations.
Niall O'Donovan (P2 W2) stood in for Eddie O'Sullivan in Japan in 2005 when the Irish head coach was part of Sir Clive Woodward's coaching team with the Lions in New Zealand, while Michael Bradley (P2 L2) filled in for Ireland in New Zealand and Australia in 2008 between Eddie O'Sullivan and Declan Kidney.
Richie Dixon (P2 L2) stood in for Scotland in Australia in 1992 when Ian McGeechan was given a sabbatical.
Unions have also appointed temporary coaches to cover one-off Tests between appointments (such as Nigel Davies for Wales against South Africa in 2007). The list also excludes those who were appointed as interim coaches but subsequently had their contracts made permanent (such as Frank Hadden with Scotland in 2005).
Cecil Afrika has scored 599 points in IRB Sevens Grand Prix events. His total comprises 66 tries and 134 goals (mostly conversions) from the 17 events in which he has appeared (up to and including the 2011-12 season opening event in Australia).

The Three Pagodas are located about 1.5 km to the north of scenic Dali, Yunnan province. They are at the east foot of the tenth peak of the massive Cangshan Mountains and face the west shore of the Erhai Lake of the ancient Dali town. It is a symbol of the history of Dali City, and a record of the development of Buddhism in the area. In 1981, Chongsheng Temple was granted to be the key protection unit of historical relics of China.
Chongsheng Temple was originally built during the Kaiyuan reign of Tang Dynasty (713-741AD). It was a famous royal monastery for the consecutive Nanzhao Kingdom and Dali Kingdom. A total of nine kings of Dali Kingdom abandoned worldly life and studied Buddhism here.
At its prime time, the temple had890 rooms, 11,400 bronze statues made of over 20,000 km of bronze at the cost of 700,000 man-days. Between the Tang Dynasty and the Ming Dynasty, Chongsheng Temple had five important implements: Three Pagodas, Big Jianji Bell, Bronze Rain Statue of the Goddess of Mercy, the Yuan horizontal board inscribed with "Capital of Buddhism". and the Ming gold statue of "Three Saints".
Xu Xiake recorded the grandeur and magnificence of this temple in his Travelogue when he visited Dali during the late Ming Dynasty. He wrote: "The three pagodas stand like a tripod: the Bronze Rain Statue of the Goddess of Mercy is as tall as three zhang the Big Jianji Bell is especially large and over one zhang in diameter and one chi in thickness,and its sound can be heard 80 li away."
During the one thousand years since the Three Pagodas were built, they have gone through war and earthquakes. They have been repaired numerous times. There was a severe earthquake in the Dali area in 1925. Few buildings in Dali survived, but the Three Pagodas were undamaged
The Three Pagodas are made of brick and covered with white mud. As its name implies, the Three Pagodas comprise three independent pagodas forming a symmetric triangle. The main pagoda, known as Qianxun Pagoda (pinyin Qian Xun Ta), reportedly built during 823-840 AD by king Quan Fengyou of the Nanzhao state, is 69.6 meters (227 feet) high and is one of the tallest pagodas in China’s history.]The central pagoda is square shaped and composed of sixteen stories; each story has multiple tiers of upturned eaves. There is a carved shrine containing a white marble sitting Buddha statue at the center of each façade of every story. The body of the pagoda is hollow from the first to the eighth story, surrounded with 3.3 meters (10 feet) thick walls. The other two sibling pagodas, built about one hundred years later, stand to the northwest and southwest of Qianxun Pagoda. They are 42.19 meters (140 feet) high. Different from Qianxun Pagoda, they are solid and octagonal with ten stories. The center of each side of every story is decorated with a shrine containing a Buddha statue.
The cultural-oriented tourism zone of Chongsheng Temple and Three Pagodas embodies an integration of mountain and sea scenery, historical relics, Buddhist culture, and leisure & vacationing function. As sacred buildings in ancient times, pagodas mainly have the following functions: First, as a landmark. Second, for storage purposes; in some Buddhist temples, pagodas are be used to store Buddhist scriptures and to keep Buddha's relics. Third, for Fengshui enhancement; pagodas are built to wall off evil forces and to enhance Fengshui.
During the renovation in 1979, more than 600 pieces of cultural relics were discovered, including hand-written Buddhist scriptures, books, engraved bronze plates, bronze mirrors, statues of Buddha made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, porcelain, jade, and quartz, and medicinal herbs. Up to now, they constitute the largest store of relics of Nanshao and Dali Kingdoms ever found, providing sure proofs of the influence of the Han culture upon minority nationalities in the border areas.
Today, travelers can visit Three Pagodas at night, when it is illuminated providing a fantastic scene. Nearby on the "marble street" there are many folk-craft workshops and stands specializing in marble and brick-painting.

German conductor, pianist and composer (b. 14 June 1848 in Nuremberg; d. 14 February 1905 in Munich).
After studying at the Leipzig Conservatory, Erdmannsdörfer became concertmaster at Sonderhausen. In 1882 he became the principal conductor of the Russian Musical Society concerts in Moscow, and professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky considered him to be "a very skillful, experienced and expert conductor", although he was "inclined to indulge the public's taste of exaggerated nuances" and "offhanded in his attitude to Russian music (except my own)" [1].
The list of Tchaikovsky's works premiered by Erdmannsdörfer includes the Symphony No. 1 (revised version, 1883), Suite No. 2 (1884), Concert Fantasia (1885), and the symphony Manfred (1886), The composer valued Erdmannsdörfer's arrangement of his Chant sans paroles (No. 3 from Souvenir de Hapsal, Op. 2) so highly that Tchaikovsky conducted it himself in 1892.
3 letters from Erdmannsdörfer to the composer, also dating from the late 1880s, are preserved in the Klin House-Museum Archive.
Two inmates in a Nigerian prison could be executed as soon as Tuesday, sources told Amnesty International, prompting the organisation to call for their appeals to be respected and preparations of the gallows to be halted.
The news came three weeks after the Governor Edo State in the Southwest of Nigeria, Adams Oshiomhole, signed their death warrants.
According to information received by Amnesty International, neither the convicted prisoners nor their families have been informed of the planned date of execution.
"The Nigerian authorities must immediately halt any plans to execute the two prisoners on death row in Benin City prison," said Lucy Freeman, Amnesty International’s Deputy Programme Director for Africa.
"To go ahead with any execution of prisoners when their death sentence is still being challenged in the courts is a flagrant violation of human rights."
“Refusing to provide convicted persons and family members advance notice of the date and time of execution is a clear violation of human rights. It is cruel, inhuman and degrading.”
Prison wardens at Benin City prison were seen preparing gallows for the executions between Sunday night and Monday morning.
A Court of Appeal ruling is still pending after a further appeal was submitted by a Nigerian NGO, the Legal Defence and Assistance Project, in March 2010 on behalf of then 840 death row inmates, including the pair in Benin prison.
The Governor of Edo State signed the execution warrants after prison authorities informed him that the death row inmates in Benin City prison were ‘becoming unmanageable.’
Some death row inmates had been involved in a recent jailbreak incident in Oko prison, according to the Edo state Attorney General.
"Amnesty International repeats that to execute detainees purely as a method of controlling ’unmanageable’ inmates is arbitrary and a totally unacceptable violation of their right to life," Freeman added.
The Edo State Attorney General and Commissioner of Justice Osagie Obayuwana have previously refused to confirm when the executions would take place, but indicated the decision would be taken by the state prison authorities.
The comptroller of Oko prison in Benin City later refused to confirm or deny to Amnesty International when and if the executions would take place.
States which maintain the death penalty in law are obliged under international human rights law and standards to ensure transparency in its use.
Refusing to provide convicted persons and family members with advance notice of the date and time of execution is contrary to requirements under international human rights standards, which require inmates on death row and their families to be given reasonable advance notice of the scheduled date and time of the execution, with a view to reducing the psychological suffering caused by the lack of opportunity to prepare themselves for this event, as well as to allow their lawyers to file final appeals as appropriate.
Information with regard to any scheduled execution must be made publically available. Children and other family members of people to be executed must be provided with the date, time and location of a pending execution, and must be allow a last visit or communication with their convicted relative.

Hey guys, have been working on a little game in bge and am making good progress with no python knowledge . I have a problem. When the player tank comes within the radar of the enemy tank, the enemy tank chases the player but enters the player when it meets the player also i have another issue where the fps comes really down in a particular stage to about 7-11 and makes it really slow and the memory is around 450M( can't remember exactly ) . Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
ok i have fixed them myself. for the tank entering the player, i used distance constraint actuator so that the tank keeps some distance from the player and for the fps stuff i just deleted the scene and recreated it i guess it was a problem with the objects or may be because i made some of the objects to send message across to other objects apart from all those i improved the accuracy of the enemy tanks using steering actuator(pathfinding). also if any body can help with the enemy bunkers; how do i make them to face the player and shoot the player while on the same spot (i guess you know how a bunker or rocket lunchers behave) the enemy bunker just seem to rotate every direction and not face the player. any help would be appreciated i would upload the blend file in blendswap any time soon
If the bunker is supposed to be static then you can use Empties to add bullets and shot through the windows of said bunker.
As for aiming goes you can use radar sensors combined with near sensors. Fairly easy to hook up and it works well for being without python.

Born 1625; died May 15 (25), 1682, in Moscow. Russian statesman and diplomat; boyar (1674). Son of a clerk.
Matveev served in the Ukraine and took part in the wars with Poland. In 1654 he was a member of the Russian delegation to the Pereiaslav Rada, and in 1656-57 he was a member of the embassy to Poland. As head of the Strel’tsy Prikaz (the regiment of semiprofessional musketeers), he took part in the suppression of the Moscow Uprising of 1662. In 1669 he became head of the Little Russian (Ukrainian) Prikaz, and in 1671 he became simultaneously director of the Posol’skii Prikaz (Foreign Office) and other central institutions.
For Matveev the basic task of Russian foreign policy was the reunification of the entire Ukraine with Russia; to attain this, he proposed a temporary suspension of the struggle against Sweden for control of the Baltic coast. During negotiations with Poland in 1672 he won Russian control of Kiev. He was close to Tsar Aleksei Mikhailovich, whose second wife, Nataliia Kirillovna Naryshkina, was a ward of his. For his times Matveev was an educated man and had a large library. He initiated the compilation of Tituliarnik, a handbook for diplomatic correspondence. After the death of the tsar he fell into disgrace and was exiled to the north in 1676 together with his family. With the selection of Peter I as tsar, Matveev returned to Moscow, but in a few days he became one of the first victims of the Moscow Uprising of 1682.

Here is a thread to vent about the game - Page 7 - Friday the 13th: The Game General Discussion - Friday the 13th: The Game
This pseudo-logic never fails to amuse me. That the ESRB "believes [F13 the Game] is generally suitable for those aged 17 years and older" does not have any inherent meaning as to what people should do. Certainly it's not determinative of what they're legally allowed to do.
This pseudo-logic never fails to amuse me. That the ESRB "believes [F13 the Game] is generally suitable for those aged 17 years and older" does not have any inherent meaning as to what people should do. Certainly it's not any kind of legally relevant fact as to what they're allowed to do.
I'll remember you said this when you come back here asking why there's animal carcasses under your kids' beds.
The fault would obviously be mine, for failing to teach them the Eleventh Commandment: Thou Shalt Not Get Caught.
That’s why you are objectively wrong. There’s no “pseudo-logic” involved with restricting violence, gore, and nudity from people who are legally children. Why not just let children into R-rated movies then? And while we’re at it, let’s get rid of the age of consent too. These are just a recommendations according to you. The only faulty logic is your own. You don’t go watch an R-rated movie expecting to see children in the theatre. You don’t go to a tattoo parlor expecting to see children in seats getting prepped for tattoos. You do not watch pornography expecting to see children in the film! You don’t go to a wedding expecting to see children getting married. I do not play an M-rated game with violence and gore expecting there to be children. What don’t you understand about things that are appropriate for adults, and things that are appropriate for children? Smh.
Then you should have no problem pointing me to the legal authority that prohibits children from playing an ESRB M-rated game, right? But, at least as far as US law goes (and I don't mean to speak beyond its scope), there's no such authority. For further discussion of why that's the case, I suggest reading Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n, 564 U.S. 786 (2011).
If what you mean to say is 'I feel strongly about who should be allowed to play M-rated games,' cool. But your personal feeling about what others ought to do is hardly an objective matter, and your false equivalency between M-rated games and the age of consent won't fly in any court other than the one between your ears.
So I played in multiple games over the past few days where some loud obnoxious kid was talking shit to everyone and openly helping Jason track down every player. I stayed on once I was killed just to watch him and Jason walking side by side trying to find the ones leftover, so it wasn't just a matter of him yelling out where people were. I wish there was a way to get them banned for life from the game! I know it's just a game, but shit like that makes people not even want to play...
Yeah i was in a lobby like that last night played pt.3 Jason killed them all next game played as Lachappa called the cops and for the 5mins. till they showed up the two of them tried but failed
So is dedicated servers more so about $ or what? Its 2018 and games have implemented DS's for a decade or more. Whats the deal?
My main issue with the game is random crashes during the pregame lobby. I've coped with and adapted to all the bugs and issues and I never make complaints about them because, despite backing the game, I understand it's a matter of trial and error at times. The pregame lobby crashing my entire game is unacceptable though.
I look at it like when parents bring their kids to the bar. Not something I'm keen on but whatever. At the same time I refrain my right to drop F bombs like a sailor. Don't like it. Tough shit. Don't bring your kid to the bar. Same with this game.
I'm done with multiplayer until the next patch....2/3 games Jason is killed. Pathetic really. What used to be "Scream" is now "Scary Movie".
I noticed @GunMedia_Ben was here posting about balancing things. Look no further than the Oct. 11 patch. Recreate that.
I think I'm just about done with the game. At least until the balance patch comes out. If they fuck that up, which is likely, I think I'm just walking away. I can have fun, sometimes, playing as a counselor but that's not why I got the game. I got the game to have fun playing as Jason Voorhees and there is just so much stupid in this game right now.
I've seen, multiple times here, people making comments that they just go AFK when they're in a lobby full of trolls. The showboating pricks that just refuse to escape. The stay-behinds. If I'm Jason and I fail to kill you and you escape, congratulations. But if you stay behind because you want to go looping through windows, run circles around a fucking table, go back and forth and back and forth and back and forth with the car? Whatever, I'm going back to my cabin, see ya later.
It's funny, on one hand, because it actually works. It actually makes many if the trolls angry you won't play their game and feed their ego. I actually never would have thought to do this were it not for folks here on the forum. On the other hand, the fact that this is even a thing, I can't stand it anymore.
This is why the chase shouldn't last as long as it currently does. The old grab range helped shorten the chase. It maybe shouldn't be overly long, but the grab range needs to be long enough to make running through the woods a death wish, like it was circa Oct. 11.
Yesterday I had one Jason just fail to drop despite a proper sweater stun followed by several quick bat whacks (yes, I was close enough)...think it was because he was too close to a building corner, and another drop to his knees and then slide -- on his knees the whole time -- halfway across the map away from Tommy. Never seen that one before.
In terms of venting, this is more about the players than the game, but it never fails to amuse me. This morning, I join a full QP lobby and spawn into Higgins Small. I run up to get the sweater right away, run smack into Jason, and then proceed to beat the shit out of him for a minute or two; three others show up and it turns into a gangbang. Less than five minutes into the match, Jason rage-quits without a single kill. Back in the lobby full of people between level 80 and 150, everyone agrees (1) that guy was a pussy for not staying and fighting, (2) Jason is desperately in need of a huge buff, and (3) there are way too many knives, sprays, and shotguns on the map.
Next game, same map, and I'm Part IV. A gang of 5 repair the 4 seater and try the same thing with me right away. After a few teabags and "Eeeeeasy Jason!" taunts, they realize they've bitten off more than they can chew when two die in one swipe and a third dies by knife while trying to limp clear to heal. Two run off, and a new third loops in trying to get the car started hoping I chase the two running off. Jarvis spawns, there's noise about getting my mask off, and finally the bitching about my slashing begins in earnest. Jarvis and two more die in a scrum by the barn, leaving me with a Tiffany and a Vanessa to finish off. Last one dies with only 2:10 left on the clock, and the whining about how I suck for taking soooooo long and only went 8/8 because I slashed them to death reaches a salty crescendo.
This happens when they think they can just pound you but if they actively play the objectives and not attack with reckless abandon, Jason is at a supreme (and spectacularly boring) disadvantage.
I love playing this game and I probably won't stop anytime soon but something will have to change or this game will be dead in the distant future.
Even though I really enjoy whacking Jason over the head with a bat many times in a row but I'd rather be scared of him and have a thrilling experience every single round. The bots show us how the game is supposed to be played, hiding from this maniac killer and actually try to survive. All you see right now is people trolling the absolute living shit out of Jason because hes definitely not that scary anymore...
I'm hoping they balance this out very soon. Give the counselors a chance at surviving but also give Jason a buff (less pocket knives to begin with) so trying to fight him becomes a suicide mission and should only be done in an emergency.
I'd hate to see this game die because it's my favourite game so far but if they keep ruining it with every new patch, this will eventually happen...
I knew the game would suffer within 2 games of the Oct 26 patch. It was painfully obvious to me that the game had been significantly damaged. I hope they are listening and fix things. If it were up to me, I'd reset back to the Oct. 11 patch and dial back the grab range 1 in-game foot. The game was the most fun before the drop icons and grab nerf.
Odd. I manage just fine under the exact same circumstances. Then again, I just start slashing when counselors decide to get close. I've basically been using J3 exclusively since the patch. Sucks to have to resort to that. But it's the only way to balance the scales.
I do notice a lot of lobbies going for the kill though. I make sure to make quick work of the sweater girl or Tommy a.s.a.p. when either is in play.
Thanks for the dialog you gave with @GunMedia_Ben. You and the others posting around that time did a good job of conveying my frustrations. ...and yeah, the only Jasons worth playing are the running Jasons, of which J3 is the best.
Way too many fucking kids playing this game now. Their presence alone ruins a lobby. Once you add them talking, their shitty playing, and inability to make decisions, it’s insufferable. I’ve consistently had to just mute 1/4 of the lobby and that’s if anyone is even using mics.
As well, I’m extremely disappointed to see so many high-level players slashing to completing and see everyone was murdered. Sure, slash Tommy and murder one or two who were trolling, but this utter fear of grabbing because someone might have a pocket knife is getting out of hand. The response to another item increase has decreased the quality of Jasons.
Jason's grab is a waste of time. I wouldn't use it either. It takes way too much time to close the distance to secure a grab only to suffer a pocket knife and be back at square one. Either you slash or 6 or 7 people escape.
Which is sad, because these few changes could bring the game back to where it should be. I didn't play through the glory days of the Jason Force Grab, but even between October (when the physical retail copy came about) and December (the latest patch), the difference in the item spawns is ridiculous.
Man! You missed out on the greatest Friday the 13th experience of our time! The only thing people really complained about during that time were the glitches, exploits, and annoying bugs. ...but the game was so fun you didn't even care! lol!
Agree 100% - counselors are their own greatest enemy these days. Conversely, as Jason the best thing I can get is a bunch of people who'd rather troll/go for the kill over efficiently escaping ASAP. It won't be much fun, but I'm much more likely to wipe the lobby.
If that same group had focused on only engaging/stunning me long enough to get the 4 seater fixed, then shifted to the nearby phone house to split me between the call and the car start, anywhere from 4-6 of them would have escaped for sure.
I still either wipe lobbies clean or at times 1-2 escape because shit happens...But if the counselors played properly, the majority could get away pretty easily.
With all the issues in the game right now i had an idea pop into my head last night and i had to make this. All in good fun of course.
Just logged in to say I'm officially done with this game until the new patch, if that doesn't put some respect on Jason's name then I'm done for good and I hope this f**king game dies.
Just played for about 5 hours today, every time I got Jason was the most FRUSTRATING experiences I've ever had since launch. The new meta seems to be juke Jason and when you run out of stamina.....Just turn around and smack him ONE f**king time and get your stamina back since Jason's hit detection is so LAUGHABLY bad that you won't get a slash off before you eat a f**king wrench to the face. Rinse and repeat until game timer runs out. On the off chance that Jason DOES grab one of these douches, you either get a knife to the neck or they rage quit in your grasp if they don't have one.
Playing as a counselor yields no challenge, cops are called and objectives fixed on the regular, if they're not....It only means the counselors are having a Jason ass kicking contest to see who can embarrass him more.
This is pathetic, Gun Media/IIfonic, SHAME ON YOU for turning a horror icon into a bumbling f**king idiot to appease these types of players. SHAME ON YOU for not IMMEDIATELY fixing him when it was discovered how bad he actually is once you took away the only OP things about him (Grab/trap stack)
This game.....Hell, this whole damn franchise... is about JASON!!! NOT THE STUPID MEATBAGS HE KILLS!!! Why are you catering to them? If they can't stand dying as a counselor then THEY ARE PLAYING THE WRONG F**KING GAME CONSIDERING DYING IS WHAT 98% OF THEM DID IN THE MOVIES.
Let me be clear Gun Media/IIfonic, I DO NOT support YOU. I support and love Friday the 13th, and what you've done to it's main character over the course of 3 months DISGUSTS me. Fix him, fix this game, otherwise I hope this game dies a painful death and you NEVER get trusted another great horror IP.
Well, this is exactly why I started this thread, so people could vent without making new ones. Sometimes it's cathartic to get shit off of your chest.
Stop catering to the whiny counselor players. Make suicides count as kills, temp match join bans for players that rage quit when Jason catches them, reduce knives and shotguns.
I agree with you 100%. I have been a fan of the franchise when i saw the first one when i was 3 years old back in 1985 and to see what has been done to Jason is just unacceptable. Leading up to the game's release and even a little while after the devs stance was always Jason is OP and that is how it is supposed to be, counselors have a minor chance at survival and it should be a challenge and a reward when you do. Since the Oct patch they have done nothing except cater to all the cry babies who can't handle losing a game Which says a lot about them individually as a person. The game is supposed to be hard, you are supposed to die a lot, that is just how it is not the other way around. Counselors shouldn't jump into a match with the objective of solely exploiting all the issues that plague Jason and teabag and dance all over him all the while never completing an actual objective. These along with many other issues is why i made a video regarding the state of the game and how it needs to be fixed. For anyone who hasn't seen it i will link it here. @ShiftySamurai @GunMedia_Ben I hope you guys can check it out and know that all of this is coming from a die herd fan of this franchise who wants this game to be as successful as it can be and to have a long life span.
I find it really difficult as jason, especially against high level councilors. It is strange how the game has been steered towards them just kicking the shit out of jason, I mean they just hang out in packs and it's very difficult to clean up in 20 minutes.
Jason needs a boost, I'd say they have to stop making melee such a slam dunk on jason, maybe too many hits in quick succession causes a rage meter invulnerability to stun with a cool down. That way councilors know not to push their luck - they can have a few free hits then they need to run.
**I might add that I don't think anything that radical would be implemented this late in the game life cycle and it's gonna stay pretty much as it is. *
Hey bro, everything you ranted about is exactly how i feel. I havent played in approx. 3 weeks after almost punching tv. We all know how you feel and i too think this game is a comedy, not a horror. Like weve all said, it should be a fucking achievement to escape from Jason. It shouldn't be like, "hey bro tonight im going to lay jason out with the frying pan and see if i can do a 5 second teabag HEHEHE." Like what in the actual fuck is going on? I DONT UNDERSTAND what is happening to this game. My friends used to come over on weekends just to crack a few beer and play f13th because it was fun. This shit does not happen anymore because even they don't find it fun now. I am starting to see a layer of dust on the case...if the next patch is shit i am afraid the game will be overcome by dust bunnies! R.I.P Jason?❤
Totally agree, escaping should be rewarding and killing at least 5/7 counselors should be doable for most Jason’s that aren’t completely new to the game.
Seeing how the steam playerbase shrunk from 16k to 7k after the patches and now stands at 1-2k players on average a day is very telling about the current state of the game.
When you're running from Jason and you accidentally go into combat stance. Wish they'd just get rid of it. Wonky AF and causes me more death than anything. Nothing like kiting Jason for 7 minutes to press my thumb too hard on the analog stick and have no chance to get out of it soon enough.

In this chapter, we will explore why humans are driven to such strong material growth and how we could transition to a less resource-intensive form of growth in light of future physical resource constraints. Given that humans are naturally driven to growth, how do we canalize our will to grow appropriately and in line with the new incoming energy of the age?
During a materialistic epoch, such as the one that we are in, it would be natural for civilizations to generally tend towards material growth, because humans are to a large extent bound by the dominant energy of the age in which they find themselves [see Part 5].
Most cultures would, nonetheless, endeavor to preserve and promote spiritual practices that would offset materialism in order to maintain some balance. There is usually a natural understanding amongst spiritual leaders in all cultures that by abandoning spirituality completely, people could ‘lose their heads’ in materialism – and that would be especially true in a material age. Should that happen, sufficient internal moral codes to limit external material excesses would disappear.
Material growth, accomplished with restraint and within an environmentally conscious framework, would require maintaining a connection with the natural environment, but the concept of modern progress in itself depends to a large extent on moving away from nature. Urbanization and modernization go hand-in-hand, which means that physical removal from nature is usually followed by intellectual removal from nature – and vice versa.
Bearing physical constraints in mind would always be the wise thing to do, especially when moving away from nature; however, maintaining such an equilibrium when almost permanently isolated from nature may be easier said than done.
When societies are swept up in the heady currents of modernization, with the driving force being progress at all costs, nature and the environment recede into the background. They are only occasionally focused upon, usually temporarily, mainly when large environmental crises hit news headlines.
The price that we would pay for living within resource constraints would be reduced material growth with limited modernization, while the price that we are paying for powerful, unconstrained modernization is a loss of perception in relation to natural resource boundaries. The more we modernize, the further we drift away from limited resource realities and the more our collective myopia grows.
A loss of connection with nature results in a loss of empathy for it by not having any direct relationship with it. Indeed, the idea of having empathy for nature would in itself seem odd to many. However, watching National Geographic documentaries about the living earth, with us as part of the biosphere, simply doesn’t suffice.
You have to live in the natural world, or live very close to it, to engage with it and to experience it in order to have a connection with it. When such direct and natural interactions with nature are lacking, a sense of the sacredness within nature is lost. Maintaining a moral approach towards the natural world and the biosphere then falls by the wayside.
When we do not know nature directly, our inclination to appreciate it, respect it and care for it is diminished, and so is the likelihood of feeling a sense of duty or responsibility towards the natural world.
Interacting with nature regularly puts people in a better position to have natural empathy for it, because they would understand that nature has natural empathy for them in the sense that it provides for them. Everything that we use and consume comes from the natural world first and foremost. It is then processed and refined, but the modern mind tends to not make that connection consistently enough.
There is no doubt that incredible human progress has been made through modernization, notably in the sciences and technology. This progress has undoubtedly led to the further development of the human mind, but it has also led to a one-sided form of development due to our intellectual disconnect from nature.
An imbalance has developed in that modern humans do not fully comprehend that they are naturally and fundamentally connected to nature at all times, and that they are an intrinsic component of nature. We are not alien to this world and neither are we aliens in it, but one-sided intellectual development away from the natural world can and does at times lead to such a perspective.
Our dependence on material growth for modern prosperity, welfare, safety, comforts and quality of life – things that everybody wants and aspires to – means that our capacity for prioritizing anything outside of this paradigm is greatly compromised. Even the idea of limiting material growth would, in many cases, motivate an even stronger commitment to it.
Indeed, having to let go of material growth without anything to replace it would be near-impossible for most people. Much of what they have ever known, especially in the developed world, has had to do with material growth, with a bit of spiritual growth on the side. Therefore, the idea that material growth could potentially come to an end one day would oftentimes be experienced as a looming disaster of epic proportions.
Once people are modernized, they rarely voluntarily revert to the pre-modernization state. By the same token, once urbanized, people generally do not return to the land.
It can be observed in developing countries that when individuals from indigenous communities become urbanized and modernized, they tend to consider themselves as having become more advanced than their peers who had maintained their traditional lifestyles in rural areas.
This is a phenomenon that has become clearly visible in the developed world, too. City dwellers often consider themselves to be more educated, more sophisticated and more forward thinking than rural or farm residents. This became quite evident during events that played out during and after the UK-EU ‘Brexit’ membership referendum in 2016 and during the USA presidential election in the same year.
It would appear that on the part of the urbanized population there tends to be a lack of understanding of what it takes to live and work close to the land and how the educational, technological and social requirements would be different.
Urbanized middle and upper classes, therefore, seem to develop a tendency to look down on those who had “stayed behind” in the country. There is, perhaps, a perception that rural people suffer a deficit in education and a lack of sophistication and, therefore, by implication, that they lack class. In spite of such perceptions, the urban class remains fully dependent on farming communities for their food supply.
Although there are many communities worldwide with one-foot-in and one-foot-out of urban living due to spending time in the countryside with family members or by commuting from the countryside to towns or cities for work, once people become fully urbanized and have never known rural life, then choosing to become a farmer becomes a rather remote possibility.
There is, presently, a strong, ongoing, worldwide trend towards urbanization [1]. The number of countries where this trend does not feature is no more than a couple of dozen [2]. This means that there is an ongoing trend towards more materialism through the consumerism which is an embedded feature of urbanization and modern living.
When people urbanize, they get access to a variety of goods, services and forms of entertainment that they would otherwise not have access to on a consistent basis. They would also have access to modern infrastructure, amenities and technological conveniences which are lacking outside of urban areas. There are also educational and skills-oriented opportunities available in urban areas, which rural environments simply don’t provide. There is a strong correlation between urbanization and prosperity [3].
Personal growth in a material sense requires freedom. Community-oriented, traditional lifestyles don’t usually provide many opportunities for fully pursuing personal interests and objectives. Modernization, however, promises to potentially deliver individual achievement and success on multiple levels.
That people would choose to modernize in order to self-realize is simply a logical conclusion of going after opportunities, in many cases pursuing new opportunities that are opening up [4]. It is, therefore, little surprise that given the innate drive of humans to progress and to evolve, people would be drawn to self-realization through modernization within a materialistic paradigm.
Modern progress (through industrialization, mechanization and automation) only becomes a problem when global population numbers grow to the extent that massive environmental degradation is caused by so many people self-realizing through modernization that it ends up threatening the collapse of civilization back into a pre-modern age.
The natural close proximity that indigenous people have to nature allows them to maintain – quite naturally – an equilibrium between materialism and spirituality. Indeed, indigenous people are often more spiritual than materialistic, even within the context of a material age.
Human consciousness being predominantly materialistic in its orientation in the present age means that becoming more spiritual and less materialistic within an urban environment could have the benefit of reducing overconsumption on an individual level.
There is, however, a relatively large difference between personal development in a modernized setting compared to nature-based spirituality. Becoming more intellectually spiritual through self-development while living in a city does not necessarily result in having closer contact with nature.
On the other hand, it is also true that many people do, indeed, manage to maintain some form of balance by getting out of cities frequently for nature-based activities. In addition, they may also maintain frugal and responsible environmentally conscious living practices.
These individuals would probably cope better should a need ever arise to leave urban areas and return to the land. Nevertheless, it remains unlikely that even this section of society would relocate en masse from urban areas by their own volition.
Individually removing oneself on a permanent basis from a city or town could be a solution and would, perhaps, be the only real way to bring about a personal transformation in terms of actively being more in harmony with the environment on an ongoing basis.
Even so, should one make heavy use of vehicles or machinery in the countryside, one’s carbon footprint would not be much different from someone living in a megalopolis. In other words, only by reverting to the most basic of lifestyles would one actually reduce one’s personal impact on the environment and the planet.
This is due to exponential global population growth [5]. The more people there are on the planet, the higher each individual’s impact is. If we had maintained smaller numbers, the level of modernization might have been lower and our individual impact less, even when using modern technologies and equipment.
The bottom line is that, for the time being, nobody wants to go back in time in terms of progress and, in the minds of the vast majority of people, progress means modernization, which is, of course, also true for them on a practical, material level. Modern progress is what the vast majority of people want.
‘De-modernizing’, degrowing and deindustrializing go directly against the modern concept of progress and are completely counter-intuitive to the majority of people, regardless of resource depletion realities on the ground, obvious problems related to unsustainable population growth and ongoing environmental degradation.
Once intellectually modernized through urban living and by embracing modern technologies, there’s virtually no going back. In that sense, one could say that collapse is by design, because there seems to be no reverse gear built into the human psyche once it has become modernized.
Collapse happens when the majority of people within a civilization are unable or unwilling to change their thinking or their behaviors when such change would be the only way to save their civilization. Civilizations, therefore, in some cases progress themselves into collapse.
It is well recorded and reported that the environment is taking an extreme toll and showing serious signs of stress globally, while the climate is beyond doubt adversely affected. If we are unable to alter our growth trajectory, we could potentially grow ourselves into extinction through ever-increasing, ever-destructive material growth before we manage to change our thinking or before we run out of physical resources.
In 1992, over 1,700 scientists – including 104 Nobel laureates – from 71 countries signed a document named World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity [6].
“WARNING: We, the undersigned, senior members of the world’s scientific community, hereby warn all of humanity of what lies ahead. A great change in our stewardship of the earth and the life on it is required if vast human misery is to be avoided and our global home on this planet is not to be irretrievably mutilated.”
The paper highlighted specific areas in which the environment was suffering critical stresses – namely, the atmosphere, water resources, oceans, soil, forests, living species and population growth.
“We must bring environmentally damaging activities under control to restore and protect the integrity of the earth’s systems we depend on. We must, for example, move away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water.
We must manage resources crucial to human welfare more effectively. We must give high priority to efficient use of energy, water and other materials, including expansion of conservation and recycling.
We must stabilize populations. This will be possible only if all nations recognize that this requires improved social and economic conditions, and the adoption of effective, voluntary family planning.
In the analysis section, it stresses: “The greatest peril is to become trapped in spirals of environmental decline, poverty, and unrest, leading to social, economic, and environmental collapse.”
The 1992 World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity concludes: “A new ethic is required – a new attitude towards discharging our responsibility for caring for ourselves and for the earth.”
In 2017, a second warning was issued by the world scientists, with a 25th anniversary update on progress that had been made since the original warning in 1992 [7]. The second warning was considered unique in that it was said to have the highest number of scientists who had ever co-signed, and formally supported, a published journal article.
According to the second warning, progress had been made in only one of the critical stress areas since 1992 – namely, a reduction in the prevalence of ozone-depleting substances.
However, according to other reports, the ozone is not actually recovering at lower altitudes above densely populated areas, but only at higher altitudes and, as mentioned before, densely populated areas are, in fact, continually expanding due to ongoing urbanization [8] [9].
The other critical stress areas showed no improvement. From 1992 to 2017, the global population went up (by 2 billion – an increase of 35%), emissions went up, temperatures rose further, ocean dead zones increased, freshwater resources declined and so did reconstructed marine catch areas, the total combined forest area in the world became smaller and the overall abundance of vertebrate species fell (see report for details).
It’s worth doing some analysis on the reasons why very little has been achieved since 1992 in terms of “What we must do”. In a nutshell, it’s all about the economic growth imperative.
Macroeconomics is the study of the overall economic performance of a country, and ‘the growth imperative‘ is an underlying principle of macroeconomics that takes the view that growth is always good for an economy [10]. The reasoning behind it is that continuous economic growth – measured in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) – reflects better living standards for the population.
Better living standards become possible when there are more jobs and higher salaries, and that would depend on more manufacturing, more production and more service delivery. These economic activities are driven by the main objective of companies for more profits for themselves and for their shareholders (their shareholders often being employees and ordinary working people.)
Higher industrial output and more jobs result in more taxes from corporations and individuals. More taxes would mean that governments can provide better social support systems, health care services and infrastructure development and can improve overall living standards.
The growth imperative is, therefore, fundamental to modern progress, and it is usually reflected in economic policymaking worldwide as it always aims to stimulate more economic growth for the economies of all countries.
The possibility of achieving better living standards draws people from rural areas towards urban areas which results in more industrial activity – which then causes more environmental degradation [4] [3] . Any long-term decline in economic growth would cause a decline in living standards for just about everyone, except for those who had never had their living standards raised in the first place.
Generally speaking, once living standards rise and people enter the middle classes through upward mobility, they vote for politicians who would continue to secure their living standards. Also, voters usually wish that the politicians they vote for support policies that would provide opportunities for the further raising of their quality of life through sustained and consistent economic growth.
This means that virtually all economically active people support the economic growth imperative, whether in developing or developed nations. The more that people have their material living standards raised, the higher the demand becomes for more material growth which, in turn, exacerbates the negative impact on the climate and the environment.
Sustainable development is, therefore, an oxymoron, because in the bigger scheme of things the economic growth imperative almost always wins out over limited resource realities and environmental concerns. If that were not the case, political parties that champion environmental causes would lead election counts, but they usually trail far behind political parties that champion economic growth.
This brings us closer to understanding why very little progress has been made since the World Scientists’ report of 1992. Simply put, virtually all the recommendations made in the report are likely to take a backseat for as long as the economic growth imperative remains an imperative.
To put this further into perspective, let’s revisit the main recommendations made in the 1992 report and explore them in more detail.
Bringing environmentally damaging activities under control to restore and protect the integrity of the earth’s systems that we depend on … will take a backseat for as long as fossil-fuel-driven industrialization, with its negative impacts on the climate and environment, remains a core component of modernization and economic growth.
Moving away from fossil fuels to more benign, inexhaustible energy sources to cut greenhouse-gas emissions and the pollution of our air and water … is unlikely to be achieved while the economic growth imperative demands further fossil-fuel-driven industrialization. Renewable energies are unable to drive economic growth to the same extent as fossil fuels because of much lower energy output [11]. The use of fossil fuels will, therefore, continue to be prioritized over renewable energies, because no one is prepared to lower their living standards.
Giving a high priority to efficient use of energy, water and other materials … will continue to be hampered by industrial expansion, modernization, urbanization, intensive farming and population growth, all of which are results of the economic growth imperative. These activities all demand huge volumes of energy, water and other materials. Efficiency can be and has been improved; in the bigger scheme of things, however, it has little impact if there are ever more of the above activities taking place (please see: Jevon’s Paradox).
Stabilizing populations … would require letting go of the economic growth imperative, because sustained economic growth to a large extent relies on population growth, especially when better levels of productivity and higher levels of consumption by fewer people cannot be generated through optimised productivity and higher levels of consumerism when there are fewer consumers [12] [14].
… improved social and economic conditions, and the adoption of effective, voluntary family planning … has contradictory objectives, because improved social and economic conditions require more modernization and industrialization, which tend to initially stimulate population growth further before it slows down later [15]. Voluntary family planning works to a degree but has limited impact in developing nations.
Reducing and eventually eliminating poverty … is hard to achieve in the developing world with ever-increasing population growth. Reducing and eventually eliminating poverty requires modernization and industrialization. Bringing everyone in the world up to First World standards would require several planets worth of resources, because there are already so many people on the planet [16]. Western standards of living have become the benchmark for what everybody would like to achieve worldwide. The more people there are globally, the more people there are who demand Western standards of living.
Ensuring sexual equality and guaranteeing women control over their own reproductive decisions … have been achieved to an extent, especially in developed nations where a plateau has been reached in terms of birth rates and where, in many cases, fertility rates have dropped [12]. The result, however, is that low population growth often means a slowdown in economic growth, because improved production methods cannot always offset a reduction in the number of people available for the labor force. Due to the growth imperative, economies cannot stagnate for too long and so low birthrates are often compensated for by mass immigration programs to replenish the workforce [13] [14].
To conclude, the possibility of becoming trapped in spirals of environmental decline, poverty, and unrest, leading to social, economic, and environmental collapse – as predicted in the 1992 report – will remain an almost inevitable outcome due to the economic growth imperative which, today, is almost universally embraced by individuals, corporations and governments.
The World Scientists’ report of 1992 talks about the need for a new ethic, but it’s difficult to see how a new ethic would be embraced while the majority of people hold onto the economic growth imperative. Only a change in our collective inner attitude could change our collective outer conduct.
Should the Spirit of the Age change organically, a new ethic could potentially arrive naturally, (as discussed in Parts 3 and 5), but that would require a shift in the metaphysical energy of the age which would result in a general shift in human thinking. Such a shift will arrive incrementally – but may not arrive soon enough to avoid a collapse of our civilization.
As we know, the problem we are facing is that the material growth imperative is responsible for the consistent destruction of the environment and biosphere because our global industrial civilization depends on the burning of polluting fossil fuels. This continuous destruction threatens to eventually result in our planet becoming uninhabitable.
A time will eventually come when humans will be less materialistic in terms of their thinking and would naturally want to move away from the material growth imperative (see Part 5) but, until such time, everything points to the fact that it would be up to individuals to make such a shift on their own (as far as that would be possible for them), both in thinking and in lifestyle.
When physical resource limits for further economic expansion and continuous material growth eventually set in to the extent that the majority of people are personally and directly affected, a general shift in thinking may occur. Regardless, lifestyle changes will eventually be forced upon people due to a decline in the availability of affordable fossil fuels and due to climate change (See: Limits to Growth – A Final Warning.)
Eventually, the number of people motivated to shift to another form of growth would swell exponentially and they would then follow in the footsteps of those individuals who had made the shift earlier on. In the meantime, all evidence points to the fact that the vast majority of people would only choose to make changes that involve a reduction in quality of life through external circumstances. They will not choose to do so except if it is absolutely necessary.
There are no limits to growth. Although there are limits to external growth, there are no limits to internal growth. One thing that will never change is our will to grow. As humans, we are absolutely driven to grow. The very reason why we are here is to grow – but not only materially so, and that is where we need to change our thinking. What has to change is the way that we grow. We need to shift our approach from being outer-growth-oriented to inner-growth-oriented.
Growth is cyclical; sometimes it is material and sometimes it is spiritual (as illustrated in Part 5). We have entered an era of exponential spiritual growth while the window for material growth is closing. Most people are so committed to material growth that they are unable to make the shift in advance – and few are even contemplating it.
Material growth is a closed circle – a self-reinforcing loop that relies on the continuous availability of limited external material resources, some of which we will eventually run out of, without there being any substitutes.
Spiritual growth in the form of inner self-development is an open, ascending spiral with infinite growth potential that draws on unlimited intangible resources within and which can be tapped indefinitely for internal expansion.
The whole objective of self-development and self-transformation is to grow beyond the general state of being that is the standard level of development of the times. Those who follow this path become the pioneers who traverse The Valley of Shadows in advance. They transcend the limits of the present paradigm early by living in the next paradigm consciously and practically, while still being in the old paradigm at the same time.
The inner growth imperative will, one day, become as powerful as the outer growth imperative is today. To be in line with the new energy in advance, we would need to switch over from an external economic growth imperative – based on material and physical accumulation and consumption – to an internal self-realization growth imperative that is based on internal expansion and the accumulation of non-tangible inner-wealth.
Once we have made this shift consciously and intellectually, we will have the ability to be happy with less and we will be able to embrace the coming changes more naturally. We will also have reduced our carbon footprint in advance. Individuals who choose this path are a minority, but they will be better positioned to pioneer and conceptualize new ways of living compared to people living exclusively in a material growth paradigm physically and mentally.
We have to evolve into creating for ourselves non-material comforts and pleasures. We have to create an environment that would provide peace and spiritual prosperity, notwithstanding having less material abundance. We have to formulate a new ethic that allows for personal and individual freedoms within the context of a renewed responsibility to our community and our environment at the same time.
This and more are achievable, but it would require forward-thinking people who are motivated to make an early shift. While we still have time, we need to envision the world that we would like to live in. It is most likely going to be a low-carbon or post-carbon civilization, meaning that we are going to return to a slower way of life. Taking a positive view of this probable future and having a pragmatic approach towards it would enable us to envision solutions more clearly as we shift.
The meaning of progress and development will change. In the future, it would mean a return to a simpler life, combined with personal inner development, as opposed to a complex life with external development in the form of possessions and status.
We have to revert to the Great Year Within and uplift ourselves. We have to spiral upwards along with the upwards-moving energy on the ascending arc of human evolution. Such a state can only be reached through self-development.
The more people start moving in this direction and combine it with a one-foot-out approach – spending more time in nature – the sooner we will make the transition in advance and the more people will be available to build resilient communities in anticipation of the coming changes.

In all of human history there have been discoveries that has benefited all of mankind the world over. The discovery of fire is one that is both significant and impactful. The discovery of fire has changed and have and continues to have impact on the world in some shape or form. As I reflect on what I heard and learned from Bishop T.D. Jakes when he spoke at The First Baptist Church of Glenarden to leaders on leadership, I walked away with a thought. The thought was based on what I heard within in his dissertation; it was both a question and a quest. It is literally and figuratively a burning question that we all should seek to answer. The answer to this question will fulfill the purpose of your life and fully fill your life experiences. What is your Fire? What is it that you are meant to do? What is the thing that you do that provides light and warmth, the thing that will consume others when they get close to you? What is that when you wake in the morning it is in your bones? What is and where is your fire?
I believe once you know the warmth of the fire, the glow of the fire it’s next to impossible to stay away from; without it, life can and will be cold, dark and uninviting. The fire should bring heat and illumination to all who come close enough to it. If someone gets to close to the fire with the right intent, they will catch fire too. Have you found your fire? What is it that get’s you going, what is it that you’re passionate about, what is it that when you are doing it, you are in your zone, you know it, you feel it. What will it take to find your fire?

The Globe Theatre in London , where William Shakespeare's most famous plays premiered; Hamlet, Othello, King Lear, Macbeth, and Twelfth Night, was built in 1599 in Southwark on the south bank of London’s River Thames by Richard Burbage. It was co-owned by Shakespeare, with a share of 12.5%. The Globe was a large, open-aired, three-tiered theater made out of timber taken from the Theatre-– a former theatre owned by Richard Burbage’s father.
The Globe Theatre burned to the ground on June 29, 1613, during a performance of Shakespeare’s last history play Henry VIII: Or, All is True, when a special effect, a cannon set light to the thatched roof and the fire quickly spread. The Globe was rebuilt in 1614.
In 1997 a third version of The Globe Theatre was built as “Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre”, close to the original site in Southwark.
Shakespeare refers to the Globe Theatre in several of his plays, describing it in the opening passage of Henry V as “this wooden O.” In one of Shakespeare’s last plays, his beloved romance, The Tempest (1611), Prospero abruptly ends his daughter’s wedding masque, claiming, “Our revels are now ended,” and continues “the great globe itself / …shall dissolve” (The Tempest 4.1.148, 153-154).1
The theatre was a sight of action. Because of no electricity, all performances were held during the afternoon. None of the props that we have today; the lights, speakers, or microphones, were present then. No play was repeated twice, all were performed at regular short intervals, in a repertory. The Elizabethan audiences were deprived of eye-catching background scenes and props. Thus emphasis was on the language and the costumes. The sumptuous, breathtaking clothes were the highlight of every performance. The materials were luxurious; velvets, furs, silks, lace, cottons and taffeta.
There were no actresses at that time; the male actors played the female characters, like Ophelia in Hamlet or Desdemona in Othello. The acting profession had a bad reputation, though it gained more respect during Shakespeare's time. Actors were seen by the Elizabethan audience as unruly, scruffy, rowdy and a threat to a peaceful society. But their popularity increased enormously. Some of the most famous Elizabethan actors were Henry Condell, Nathan Field, Richard Burbage, William Kemp and John Hemmings. Because of no mikes, the actors had to over-act to make themselves understood in the noisy, open-air theater, using exaggerated gestures of the arms and hands to portray the plot.
Even though the plays were often bawdy and despite the actor’s lack of good acting skills, Shakespeare's language made the plays unforgettable. He was a master of language, and his influence on English still remains strong today. He coined phrases since used so often that they have become clichés—"too much of a good thing,"2 "what's done is done,"3 "all's well that ends well,"4

The reconstruction of the Globe Theatre in Southwark invites discussion of the effect on the audiences of Shakespeare's plays by the kind of venue for which they were designed. The experiences of modern Globe audiences may potentially even validate the procedures displayed in the scripts, though modern critics such as the New Historicists rarely discuss the nuances of performance as a self-sufficient subject: they tend to abstract aesthetic, sociological, political, or even moralistic censure of texts. This emphasis was shared by the theoreticians of the sixteenth century, such as Sir Philip Sidney, whose Defense of Poetry censured Elizabethan stage practice from an Aristotelian point of view, rather than exploring the distinctive nature and dynamics of Elizabethan drama. Nevertheless, Shakespeare failed to defend his art as seen on the Globe stage, despite comments on "acting" throughout Hamlet and on theatrical illusion in the choruses to Henry V. As a result Hamlet's personal admonitions to the players are sometimes mistaken for hints of such an authorial account, for example by the celebrated Restoration actor, Thomas Betterton (as cited in Gildon's biography). Yet to take these academic censures for the dramatist's own views would be a classic error about the author's role. For the sophisticated Hamlet, fresh from the radical University of Wittenberg, cannot be equated with the non-university-educated Shakespeare: the play's hero is an aloof academic critic like Sidney, censuring the vulgarity of contemporary theatrical stage practices of companies such as Shakespeare's own. The doubts of some modern literary critics (like Harry Berger in Imaginary Audition) about the significance of the detailed practices of theatre arts thus finds analogous Renaissance precedents, not to mention Plato's wholesale repudiation of drama in The Republic.
Theorists both then and now share suspicion of naïve performers who deal directly with popular audiences' desire for lively stories about seductive personalities, whether in Renaissance England, Italy, or Spain—all locations where popular theatres shared professional practices to a remarkable degree. This affinity appears in the resemblance of the stage configurations of the Rose and Globe Theatres to the Spanish corrales de comedias like that at Almagro, and in the types of plots and characters which audiences preferred to see on these stages, preferences openly accepted by leading lights such as Cinthio, Lope de Vega, and Shakespeare. The tours of English players in Northern European countries such as Germany can be documented, but historical playhouse contacts between English performers and those of Mediterranean countries such as Italy and Spain are more elusive, despite shared methods and devices. However, there have been increasing efforts to co-ordinate the theatre practices of these countries in Louise Clubb's Italian Drama in Shakespeare's Time, and the anthology Theatre of the English and Italian Renaissance, edited by Ronnie Mulryne and Margaret Shearing. My essay in the latter, "Shakespeare's Verismo and the Italian Popular Tradition," argued for Shakespeare's alertness to Italian precedents, seen in his use of Cinthio's tragicomedy Epitia as a model for Measure for Measure. Shakespeare also found sources in Cinthio's Hecatommithi, for Othello and A Midsummer Night's Dream, as well as for Measure for Measure. There are also some indications that commedia dell'arte troops did reach London in Shakespeare's time, in the protests of the Remembrancer of the City of London, Thomas Norton (co-author of the first Elizabethan tragedy, Gorboduc). In his Exhortation (1574) he warned the mayor against "unnecessary and scarcely honest resorts to plays, . . . and especially the assemblies to the unchaste, shameless, and unnatural tumblings of the Italian women" (Richmond, Shakespeare's Theatre, 315). So there may have been some women performers on Elizabethan stages, albeit Italians.
There is also now a greater sense of some consistency in themes, characters, and staging between the English and Spanish theatrical traditions, as reflected in the anthology Parallel Lives: Spanish and English National Drama 1580-1680, edited by Louise and Peter Fothergill-Payne. However, in that book's section on "The Great Divide" between Elizabethan England and contemporary Spain, Don W. Cruikshank observes that, during the lifetime of William Shakespeare, England was more or less continuously at war with Spain, at least until the accession of James I. Thus, dramatists like Lope de Vega had only "a fairy-tale view of England" (199) despite surviving its circumnavigation as a member of the Spanish Armada in 1588. However, the English saw Spain as a major power, even if a hostile one: "works of Spanish literature were major sources of inspiration for English dramatists. . . . Spanish plots, characters, references, and words were almost too numerous to count" (203). In the narrower field of theatre, John J. Allen has also opened up what he calls "a possible relationship" between the similar open-air structures of the theatres of Lope de Vega and Shakespeare in his essay on "The Spanish Corrales de Comedias and the London Playhouses and Stages" in Franklin Hildy's anthology New Issues in the Reconstruction of Shakespeare's Theatre. Much remains to be done, particularly on any effects of direct personal contacts, but my concern here is focused on another aspect of the relationship of these three great theatrical traditions than was covered in these earlier studies. For the close resemblances between the three dramatic traditions suggest their playwrights might share the same artistic practices. As dramatists often working in similarly structured theatres, the discourses of the two non-English masters of theatre might explain professional resources and practices in which Shakespeare would share fully.
Of course, English critics such as Sir Philip Sidney had their neo-Aristotelian analogues in the French and Italian academies. These traditional classicists all served as exponents of artistic principles they held to be relevant to Renaissance drama. However, the stage practices of contemporary European playwrights often followed a different pattern from the academicians' ideas, which in turn generated a craft contrasting to Aristotelian precepts, one dictated by immediate audience responses not philosophical principles. This wholly contemporary ordering of drama is reflected in the vindication of his own stage practices in Cinthio's Discorsi (1554) on the nature of tragedy, comedy, and romance, which seek to vindicate the theatrical success found in "mixed" or double tragedies (tragedies with a happy ending for the good characters and unhappy for the bad ones). The popularity of this genre was reluctantly conceded even by Aristotle in his Poetics, though his personal taste was for a single, fatal plot. Such mixed plays approximate to those now identified as tragicomedies, following a term in the prologue to the Amphitryon of Plautus. The precedents in Cinthio were matched by Lope de Vega, in his El arte nuevo de haçer comedias (1609), which followed Cinthio in questioning the enforcement of academic abstractions in the face of overt audience responses and demands. The principles enunciated in these treatises provide the validation for Shakespeare's practices which the English theatre supposedly failed to provide, though there are echoes in the preface to a version of Guarini's Il pastor fido (1590), The Faithful Shepherd (1609), by John Fletcher (who succeeded Shakespeare as dramatist to the King's Men). In such texts, the tragicomic mixing of genres in a multi-layered plot is justified in a variety of ways: partly by its truth to the universal experience of the mixture of feelings, but above all by the greater entertainment value of diversity, in contrast to the consistent emotional tone exacted by classical genres.
Shakespeare is commonly held not to have provided such an overt aesthetic for this mixed genre of most of his plays; however, as a playwright he mostly conforms to the theories and practices of Cinthio and Lope in failing to follow Aristotelian norms (the most obvious exceptions being The Comedy of Errors and The Tempest, which seem to observe the unities of time, place, and action). This flexible posture may be partly attributed to his debts to the "realistic" diversity of tone in Cinthio's novelle collection, the Hecatommithi, from which elements of Othello derive, not to mention such dramatic models as Cinthio's Epitia, with its specific precedents for the mixed moods of Measure for Measure. The explicit pragmatism of Cinthio and Lope in their treatises matches Shakespeare's questioning of the idealism of the failed academy of Love's Labour's Lost, and perhaps also in the ambiguous attitudes of the over-intellectual Hamlet, with his theoretician's carping at the uneven practices of the popular theatre (3.2.1ff.). However, the three dramatists were not writing exclusively for Hamlets but also for the "groundlings" whom Hamlet utterly despises. In contrast, we can find a much more accurate representation of the expedient evolution of stage practices in the early debates between the humble workmen in A Midsummer Night's Dream (1.2, 3.1), who approximate to a cross-section of popular elements in Shakespeare's own audience (while the aristocrats' more debatable views are included only later, and conflict with the success of Pyramus and Thisbe in performances for most audiences). The workmen's laborious application of audience-response to their planned performance matches that wryly accepted by Cinthio and Lope de Vega. The recent physical recovery (or recreation) of the theatres for which these dramatists composed invites us to re-animate the relevant aesthetic, which is not the rigorous Aristotelianism of critics such as Sir Philip Sidney but the expedient, popular dynamics of tragicomedy.
As the precursor and fullest expositor of the issues, Cinthio deserves priority. Ironically, as Camillo Guerrieri Crocetti notes in his edition of Giovambattista Giraldi Cinzio's Scritti critici (to which I am largely indebted for the following outline of Cinthio's career and quotations), Cinthio was himself an academic, professor of philosophy at the University of Ferrara, and tutor to the illegitimate son of Ercole II, and later ducal secretary (7). After retiring to Mondoví from Ferrara Cinthio wrote the Hecathommithi, now his best-known work. However, stage success came with his tragedy of Orbecche, although it provoked others to attack his theatrical innovations, such as the actual staging of the suicide of the hero. In a more classical vein, his other plays include Cleopatre and Didone. Later, violence obtruded even more drastically in his dramatic career when the presentation of his Altile before Pope Paolo III was stopped by the assassination of the lead actor, Flaminio Ariosto, a few hours before the perfomance. Nevertheless, the prologue included the assertion: "if you still insist that the play not be classified as tragedy, you can call it a tragicomedy" (8).
In a fuller development of this issue, in 1543 he wrote the letter containing his discourse on tragedy and comedy, first published in 1553 along with his Discorso intorno al comporre dei romanzi (1549), for which he was attacked bitterly once more, particularly by G. B. Pigna, his ex-student, who sought to vindicate more rigorous academic standards in a way anticipating Robert Greene's attacks on Shakespeare and other journeyman playwrights. The cause is readily apparent in the Discorso dei romanzi, in which Cinthio rejects established precedent: "the poet should never subject himself to tradition, nor lose sight of the innovations demanded by his own time." For Cinthio "the essential element of poetry is mimesis, that is, the imitation by which the Aristotelian concept distinguishes the poem from history in so far as the latter is an imitation of the particular and the former that of the universal, which, variably understood by the critics of period, was identified for Cinthio with veresimilitude" (13).
While Cinthio insists that the moral function of art "associates instruction with delight" (15) in Discorso sulle comedie e sulle tragedie, he also confronted the problems of the art of poetry in an Aristotelian context, while expressing a distinctively personal point of view (20). Thus he enlarged the limits beyond the space of a day, and his artistic exigencies appear vividly in the necessity to combine, for the purposes of catharsis, the comic element with the tragic, and to admit some scenes of horror and death on to the stage (22). Moreover, "his tragedies, if not works of art, are designed for the theatre more than the study, and respond or seek to respond to the preoccupations of the public. The mass of spectators is always present in the thought of Cinthio, not yet as in Castelvetro (who will make them into a tyrannical source of laws and rules), but as, in the following century (granted some indebtedness) with Lope de Vega, in his theatrical composition (as he affirms in his little treatise), who applied it in stage practice and real life under the eyes of the concerned spectators for whom it was designed" (22-3).
This is not to say that Cinthio favors the modern fashion of attracting attention by violating standards of plausibility or coherence. He even provides precedents for Hamlet's advice to the players when he indicates his concern for sobriety in serious drama:
I see some in our time (to speak of comedy) who many times have moved laughter on the stage, although they achieve that by unseemly and dirty methods, with irrelevant behavior, worthy rather of drunkards and taverns and disreputable persons rather than by praiseworthy actions, which acquire all praise, and lead to a proper ending as befits a well-conducted comedy. While such things as are done do not reflect decorum or manners, or anything else which belongs to a worthy action. Into this error, Messr Giulio, no poet will ever run who considers that these jokes and sentiments which bring laughs into comedy should come there with a propriety which is not remote, not lying, not affected, not dragged in, but as they are born from things themselves, with that dexterity and that smooth method which is achieved by things natural and not distant from the civil and good manners, such that they can be used properly amongst citizens.
However, Crocetti asserts that catharsis can, according to Cinthio, be obtained in various ways. Peripeteia, or reversal of a situation to elicit pity and terror, can occur either when a hero passes from a happy state to an unhappy one, or in the opposite situation, in which the wicked fall from good fortune to bad, while the good go from misfortune to good. The two latter outcomes are those of tragicomedy alone or combined, of which the larger versions, richer in characterization and plots, are dear to Cinthio. Because tragicomedy does not lose sight of the effect of moral purification and the emotions that produce this, tragicomedy equals formal tragedy, and is more enjoyed by the public than the latter. The interest for Cinthio of tragicomedy lies in a lively need for novelty, which places him, despite contrary pressures, outside of Aristotelianism. His tragicomedy was a daring twist away from the distinction between the genres defined by classical experience. As Crocetti concludes:
Those who will champion or later assume the defense of the new genre will call on nature with a broader perspective in which laughter and lament, the serious and facetious, the sublime and the mediocre recur either alternately or mixed together in the unity of life, of reality. These will be the arguments maintained by Juan de la Cuerva, by Lope da Vega . . . in their treatises. In the ferment of these problems and of criticisms more or less severe, Giraldi did not limit himself to proposals but wished rather to activate, if not happily, his conception, which will open new horizons in the theatre, into which Lope de Vega, Calderon, and Shakespeare will expand.
These precedents in Cinthio were indeed matched by Lope de Vega in his brief verse treatise El arte nuevo de hacer comedias (in Gilbert, 540-8), which followed Cinthio by questioning the enforcement of academic abstractions in the face of overt audience resistance and demands for other outcomes. Lope de Vega's validation of the stage practices of the commercial theatres of his time provides another justification for the practices of devotees of popular art against its Aristotelian critics, both then and now. This exposition of the values of the Renaissance popular stage indicates further criteria by which the impact of the restored Globe can be measured. Lope de Vega's more compact and candid outline of the values relevant to Shakespeare's practices at the Globe appears in his expository poem. This poem purports to be a respectful exposition to Aristotelian critics of the time about the practices and conditions of the contemporary theatre as found at Madrid theatres resembling the Globe: "You order me, lofty spirits of Spain, who in this society and illustrious academy will in a brief space of time exceed in excellence not only those of Italy, . . . but Athens too, . . . to write you a treatise on the art of making comedies which may be acceptable for the use of the public" (541). Throughout Lope ironically professes awareness of the aesthetic superiority of the neoclassical principles of drama which his academic audience derives from Aristotle, while bemoaning the quite different dramaturgy exacted of him by contemporary audiences: "I write in the manner of those devisers who aspire to the acclaim of the crowd; for, since it is the crowd that pays, it is proper to speak to it stupidly in order to please" (542). This is that "quantity of barren spectators" whom Hamlet censures (3.3.41). Modern theatre critics following Lope's perspective may see the populist character of performances at the reconstructed Globe less well through the eyes of an intellectual such as Hamlet than from the perspective of an experienced practitioner such as Lope de Vega.
Popular theatre audiences are also the ones for whom Lope de Vega insists his predecessors, such as Lope de Rueda, had composed their earlier comedies. So crude were their expectations, he notes, that Rueda introduced into them "the affairs of mechanics, and the love of a blacksmith's daughter" (542)—seemingly matched by the "mechanicals" in A Midsummer Night's Dream and the "jailer's daughter" in The Two Noble Kinsmen. Rueda excelled in playing rascals and fools, who also appealed to Shakespeare. Morover, two of Rueda's plays are based on Italian originals which were used by Shakespeare: Eufemia like Cymbeline derived from Boccaccio, and Los engañados like Twelfth Night from the anonymous Gl'ingannati. The ancient Athenian precedents, of course, had higher critical status, for Cicero had called them "a mirror of customs and a vivid image of truth" (543). His metaphor provides another academic precedent for Hamlet's expectation of plays which will "hold the mirror up to nature" (3.3.22). But for Lope de Vega modern audiences are less traditionally minded: "you asked me to write on the art of making comedies in Spain, where whatever is written is against art; and to tell you how comedies are written, contrary to ancient art and the foundation, is to ask me to give my experience rather than art" (543).
Somewhat tongue-in-cheek, Lope then proceeds to expound a new set of procedures imposed because "I have to obey those who can command me, . . . gilding the error of the mob" (544). After asserting that kings may appear in modern as in ancient comedy, Lope enunciates his first assumption of the nature of popular drama: "The tragic mixed with the comic, Terence with Seneca, although it be like another Minotaur of Pasiphae, will make one part grave, the other absurd: and this variety gives much delight. Nature gives us a good example, for because of such variety it has beauty" (544). Lope then concedes the Aristotelian principle of unity: "one should not be able to remove any part of it without destroying the whole context" (544). However, he absolutely rejects the other constrictions on theatre required by Sidney: "It is not necessary to prescribe that it take place within the limits of one day, though this is a precept of Aristotle" but only "in the least time possible" (544). However, historical material may require a gap of "several years" between the acts (as in The Winter's Tale), or "a character can go on some journey" (544), as in Cymbeline. As for the unity of time, Lope ridicules the compression required by the limit of one day's action on stage, because of "the years that must elapse in matter which ends in one artificial day" (545). By contrast, modern Spaniards are quite happy to progress from Creation to Last Judgment "within two hours." Obviously, Spanish plays share in the comprehensive chronology of the English medieval drama, from which Shakespeare and his audiences inherited their indifference to the unity of time.
In terms of format, Lope had favored three acts, perhaps with interludes, though he says that more recently he has favored "a dance, because dance means so much in comedy" (545). In this he shares the values reflected in Will Kempe's jigs, which regularly concluded any kind of dramatic presentation at such theatres as the Rose and Globe, and may even have served to "deconstruct" any tragic mood. Such assertions justify the Dance of Death with which Mark Rylance recently concluded his first Hamlet at the Globe, with highly positive audience response. Equally aware of audience response, Lope insists: "Do not permit the denouement until you arrive at the last scene: for when the crowd knows the end, it turns its face to the door and its back on the conclusion" (545). For similar reasons, "rarely should the stage be left without a character who is speaking, for in these intervals the crowd becomes unquiet" (545). As for characterization Lope requires the appropriate language, whether for kings, or lower classes: "How deceptive the servants are, how shameless the lady is, full of fraud and wiles of every sort!" (548). By similar analogy to Shakespeare's witty transvestite heroines, we find the counsel: "Let ladies be in keeping with their characters, and if they change costume let it be in a manner that can be excused, for male disguise is very pleasing" (546). He notes "How wretched, unhappy, foolish and inept the lover" appears to be in most Spanish popular drama (548), just like Shakespeare's Orlando, Orsino, or Bertram. Despite such stereotyping of characterization, consistency of costume is irrelevant: "for in Spain today, comedy is full of barbarous things: a Turk wearing a Christian's neck-gear and a Roman in tight breeches" (547). This resembles Peacham's sketch of a scene from Titus Andronicus. Here we can see the shared timeless aesthetic of the Spanish and English Renaissance theatres, with clear guidelines for modern theatrical experiments at the Globe. There is some divergence from the scrupulous medievalism of the Globe's first Henry V. Modern designers seemingly should not be overzealous for historical production values in their costumes if they wish to explore the original popular staging of Shakespeare.
Overall, Lope stresses the primary need for suspense throughout so that "until the middle of the third act no one can even guess at the solution. Always deceive anticipation, and so it may come about that something quite remote from what is intended may be left to the understanding" (as with the notorious last scene of Cymbeline). Indeed, "equivocal speech and the uncertainty arising from the ambiguous has always held a great place with the crowd for it thinks that it alone understands what the other man is saying" (as with audiences' delight in the equivocations of Richard of Gloucester's black humor). Such considerations suggest that, rather than seeking to rationalize Shakespeare's intentions more subtly, one might simply explore the reversals and paradoxes of his plotting as staging devices to capture and retain audiences' attention.
For, in the end, on the basis of his own 438 comedies (of which "all except six of them sin grievously against art"), Lope repudiates theory divorced from expert practice, which is its own justification: "Listen attentively, and do not dispute about art, for in comedy everything will be found of such a sort that if you listen to it everything is apparent" (548). Thus the principles enunciated in the treatises of Cinthio and Lope de Vega provide a validation for Shakespeare's practices, as echoed in the preface about tragicomedy to The Faithful Shepherdess, by John Fletcher (also dramatist to the King's Men). In such texts, the tragicomic mixing of genres in a multi-layered plot is justified in a variety of ways: partly by its truth to the universal experience of the mixture of feelings, but above all by the greater entertainment value of diversity, in contrast to the more consistent emotional tone exacted by classical genres. Hence Shakespeare's titles: As You Like It and What You Will—the "you" refers to the response of actual theatre audiences of 1600, making the ultimate consideration simply the actors' direct interaction with such specific live audiences. The recent physical recovery (or recreation) of the Renaissance theatres for which the three dramatists composed invites more awareness of this expedient aesthetic. Rather than applying the rigorous neo-Aristotelianism of critics such as Sidney, we might recognize the more expedient dynamics of popular tragicomedy in all ages from classical Greece through Renaissance Ferrara and Madrid, down to the modern restored Globe Theatre. © HMR

No we don't support it (and probably never will)... right now it can be only paypal, moneybookers, alertpay, if you find some other global payment system what is available to everyone, not only company then we can try add it.

Forum upgrade complete. As before, please let us know (in this post, via PM or email) of any issues you encounter with the forum going forward.
One significant change is the new board style; we know some people will prefer the old style, so it's still available: in your User Control Panel (now under your login name in the top right corner), under "Board preferences", you can select "prosilve_unskinned" as your board style to get the old style back. See the screenshot below for information. It will still look a _bit_ different overall due to the new phpBB version, though.
It will come as no surprise to some of you that our forum software is on the older side, and in need of an update. While the current system has worked fine for years, there are updates (security and functionality) that we're missing out on, and right now new members can't even register without administrator intervention due to reCaptcha v1 being retired.
So - we're upgrading the forum to the latest phpBB version. This will allow us to enable reCaptcha v2, so new users can register (and hopefully fewer spam accounts will get through!), as well as put us in a better place for updates going forward.
This is a fairly significant change, however we'll try to be minimally disruptive. We are currently planning on starting the full upgrade at 10PM EST, Wednesday May 2nd. So from 10PM EST 5/2 to 10AM EST 5/3, expect some amount of delay or disruption, possibly including the forum being completely unavailable.
After 10AM EST 5/3 (or once I make an update post saying the process is complete), please let us know of any bugs, errors, issues, missing content/icons/etc. that you run into while using the forum.
We have a testing version of the new forum setup right now - anyone who would like to help us test it, to ensure the new version is as solid as possible, please PM or email me. It currently has a clone of the main forum state from about a week ago; all data in the testing forum will be deleted before the upgrade.
I do not have time to search every subforum in this forum for new posts and count on those features to find out what is going on and who has been left behind quickly.
Will, it looks like those are now under the "Quick Links" menu in the top menu header - "New posts" and "Unanswered topics" are both in there. I checked through all the board settings and didn't see anything specifically mentioning those two features, though I did find some phpBB extensions talking about them; so, if those aren't what you're talking about, there are some options.
I am an admin on a phpBB forum as well, but it runs underneath a software package provided by the hosting service. I went to go check there, but we don’t have that drop down available to us.
Yeah, it's definitely new in the latest phpBB forum that we just upgraded to. I'm still learning my way around too X)
I'm glad no functionality was lost, though still do let us know if you find anything else that's unclear or not accessible.
I just returned after a long time away (been very busy). I just wanted to say that I think the new board looks very nice. I hope the functionality meets everyone's requirements, since it looks much better, IMHO.

So if you're browsing in an entry in one specific cateogry ( news ) it just would display related entries that match the tags and are in that same category (news ).
The extension doesn't support this. I'm really busy so I can't promise to add this very soon. It's not hard - just add another parameter "incategory" which turns on limitation to the categories of the current entry. This sounds so useful that I might actually do it this week ...
Constantly trying to make PivotX better ... (I accept donations through Paypal. Just send money to hansfn@pivotx.net - select "friends or family".)
actually i found a simple solution for this. I'm using the categories "pictures" and "videos" and have two different templates for those entry pages.
What i still try to achieve is using thumbnails as related links. I'm using the extension "gallery" but now don't know how to implement [[ gallery_image ]] which created the thumbnails by timthumb, to the above code . I mean something like this:

Sorry but I am not familiar with this extension. If you are requesting an upgrade to it you can try the author.
This extension provides all the basic form elements in HTML, provides basic validation (required, some types, regexp) and provides a few basic actions, like 'hashcash protect' and 'mail' (the other two or 'validate' and 'message').
Because this extension has been build with the knowledge that you can never incorporate every wanted feature in any form system. It has been build to be extended to add new elements, new validations, new actions and new standard forms. Even the features it provides by default are created using the same framework, so there are a lot of examples you can choose from to build your own.
I must say, I understand there's not much documentation, but a one-page step by step instruction for installing and set-up would be very much welcomed!
How and where can I format the buttons and activate them, because now they don't seem to work... Thanks in advance again!
I will add some more documentation for the initial setup. However, the extension already provides 'Add standard form', which should set you up with two forms you can later customize.
A specific question, the 'submit' and/or 'reset' buttons are automatically added when you enter a title for them on the form-meta screen. In the future it will be possible to really customize the buttons, but for this initial release, it's only possible to add those.
To style the form you really need to add your own CSS, this will be in a later release of course, but it's just not ready to release right now. You can assume most field-elements just have a 'label'-tag or a '.label', with the input element after that in the HTML. Only radio's and checkboxes require some exceptions from that.
Documentation suggests you use the 'Add standard form' and play with that before trying to setup your own form. Also some other documentation updates, but it still far from perfect.
Added a default CSS for forms. Forms should at least look a bit better initially. Styling is light and can be easily overwritten in your of CSS.
- I'm not quite sure what the spamprotection entails. If currently, you fill in a valid message, but the message is all spam (I tried it with some curse words and the word viagra), the form still sends it and I still get the mail. Is that the way it was intended?
- How and where can I change the length of the entry-field for the text? I'd like it to be a bit longer.
- If I want people to fill in their phone number in a seperate field, how should I do that? Eventually I'll recieve the phone number as part of the email body, obviously
- a more difficult question: how can I be sure a hacker doesn't break into this form and starts using it for sending spam to other people? That has happened with my previous (non-pivot) website back in 2004.
Spamprotection is meant to block spammers from using your script to mail other people (your last point). It requires a spammer to execute the included javascript to generate the correct number which can be verified on the server side, this is called a hash-cash. It doesn't disable a spammer which puts in a bit of effort to use the form, but it does slow him down and he would more likely look for weaker forms to hack. It's the same protection PivotX uses for comments, only a (much) newer version of it. Also, as a side effect the module only allows an X number forms to be submitted in a certain timeframe, but that's currently only a side-effect.
In the future I could add real form throttling, or IP-blocking etc. For now this hashcash-check should be enough.
You should add CSS statements in your own styleshee, targetting the div.input and the input's themselves. There is no way to add a 'size' or 'maxlength' at the moment.
Try to the form first, before you continue. Until we have an extension to this extension to add a 'phone-type' you could use
a regular expression to check for phonenumbers. Try this only when this field works, otherwise it will be hard to spot what's wrong.
It's far from perfect but it only allows generic phonenumber characters (numbers and dashes etc) and requires a total string length of 10 to 13.
I've tried to do all kinds of stupid thing with it, like fill in half emailadresses and what not. Still worked perfectly, so thanks!
My next step: I'm going to create forms for the seminars I'm going to give. Will show you once done.
If I use a radio-button, somehow the button doesn't pass any information in the email I receive. I'm not sure what the function of the radio-button is then.
Required doesn't work for checkboxes yet. From the form-standpoint it useless, but I agree, there is a use for it when you want things like 'I agree to the terms'. Will fix.
What did you enter in the 'Text' field (below 'Source')? It should be a list of options. I will add help because I see it's missing completely

Child custody (parental responsibility) and visitation (parenting time) are often a top concern for divorcing or divorced parents. Divorce can be stressful on parents and children alike and, at Erlich Law Office, LLC, our Elmhurst child custody (parental responsibility) lawyer seeks to resolve child support and visitation (parenting time) issues with minimal strain on the family.
If you are going through a divorce, or would like to make changes to an existing custody (parental responsibility) and visitation (parenting time) order, contact the DuPage County divorce and child custody (parental responsibility) attorney at Erlich Law Office to schedule a free consultation.
Child custody (parental responsibility) refers to whether one or both parents have the authority to make major decisions regarding the welfare of the child; it does not necessarily determine the parent with whom the child resides or how much time a parent spends with the child. If joint custody (shared responsibility) is granted, neither parent can unilaterally make major decisions regarding the child. The parent with whom the child primarily resides will be designated as the custodial parent; the other parent is the noncustodial parent.
Conversely, if sole custody (responsibility) is granted, that parent has the exclusive right to make major child-rearing decisions. Sole custody (responsibility) does not mean that the other parent forfeits visitation (parenting time) rights, however, and both parents are still allowed to make routine decisions when the child is in his or her care.
Under Illinois law, child custody (parental responsibility) and visitation (parenting time) rights are determined based on the “best interests of the child,” which requires an evaluation of all relevant factors, including:
The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his parent or parents, his siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child’s best interest;
The physical violence or threat of violence by the child’s potential custodian, whether directed against the child or directed against another person;
The occurrence of ongoing or repeated abuse, whether directed against the child or directed against another person; and
The willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child.
At Erlich Law Office, our Elmhurst child custody (parental responsibility) attorney understands the desire for parents to protect their children and look out for their well-being. We also understand the interplay between child custody (parental responsibility) laws and child support laws, and our child custody (parental responsibility) and child support lawyer can help you navigate both issues so that you can provide for your children in the best possible way.

Even when his live commentary (with the currently-in-first team passing by) was introduced, I wasn't as annoyed as I am with his Face-Off commentary and general hosting this season.
Phil's popping up at random times starting with TAR25 was okay. But his Head-to-Head commentary feels so forced. And his Mat Chats this season have been kinda awkward. Also feels a little too contrived as well.
Mat chats are weird. Making Conor look like an idiot, not that he needs much help, but it seems kind of mean. Asking the skiiers who are both married who the eye-candy is?
Random ratchet Harare intersection makes the intro, yet not the ruins of Great Zimbabwe when last season showed safari animals that never actually appeared in either Tanzanian leg?
HK should've been given the Seoul treatment from last season, i.e. not shown at all in the intro besides a split-second acknowledgement at the end.
Kinda want to say that the express pass riddance, is one of the best decision ever by crews. Recent usage was just to avoid U-turn and created an unnecessary drama. Also, it created the actual pure competitive teams that would just running and running without the advantage, and thats what it was great to watch, altho we have to wait until F5 left to do so
The absence of the EP this season was quite bittersweet to me, but more sweet than bitter. Bitter because the Express Pass is one of my favorite things in TAR. Sweet because the lack of it doesn't convince any team to U-turn the team with the EP. For the past few seasons, teams with the EP have been U-turned, because they're seen as a threat with such an advantage. (Becca & Floyd are an exception because of how they received it and how nobody knows about it.)
The EP started out fine. But once it had been around teams had a pre-chance to think about how to deal with it...which makes it useless.
I don't mind the speed bump. Teams might know what it means...but they have no idea what it will be.
Gonna talk about final task here... While i really hyped for the final task, and claimed that it was one of the best final task of all time in TAR history, there was a flaw about this task (beside peach's point "properly assemble plane' thing)
You have recognized all stickers that representing 12 legs, and one of them is a magnifying glass (Prague). And the magnifying glass was representing A roadblock in Prague when the supervisor checked their answers with it.
The problem is, not all of the final task doers did the RB, and the one was Henry. I could have sworn that thing Henry changed the piece that cost his chance of be a winner was that magnifying glass, since he didnt the RB back then, so it would have confused him even more than other racers.
Also Jen on r/TheAmazingRace admitted that magnifying glass was really made them confused since not it wasnt part for the RB at all (i mean yeah it was used as decotation for checking their rb answer tho), but also came from another task in Belgium (Diamond task) which was a detour(altho it was solved by reading the detour task)
My point is they could have gone with all stickers that not only representing each legs, but also be visible with other member teams, especially non participating RB member teams. I mean, Henry and Evan could have discussed it before Henry started to assemble the plane's part, but idk if it was allowed, but crews should have prevented from a final task doer being an disadvantaged, since it was a literally final task, and it would be unfair.
That, however, is my only complaint on final task, and i still happy that they made that final task. Confindently, the best final task ive watched since 12 and 21.
What a great find! yes I totally agree with you, no wonder everyone spent more than an hour for that task..
Yes, this is really unfair to the racer who did not do that specific roadblock, there is no way Henry would have known what a magnifying glass mean. Wonder if the result would be different if Evan did that task.
I think in Season 12 when they had this logic game, the items involved were all known to both racers, so this time there is really some flaws in the task planning. They could have used beer to switch for that which is an easy choice.
However, they should at least have known it from the detour clue description, unlike Henry with the magnifying glass
Yes, agree with that, at least it's a detour and when you read the clue you know at least what it could involve.
Same as the very first memory challenge in Season 3, when Zach did not do the Singapore mermaid detour but he could guess it may involve that animal on the totem.
But for the case of Henry, I think it is not likely he could guess it may be related to Prague, and it seems more difficult as there must be more than 12 pictures. For Bahrain they have the balance and the bird, so that means you also need to eliminate repeated pictures in one leg.
I think it's a bit of an issue when the teams literally could not figure out what the drawing is supposed to depict. That kinda defeats the point of it being a memory task right?
They should have just made it the symbol a phone, which could have easily lead to confusion between using it for the teleboutique in Tangier or the Prague RB. As far as I can tell, the only thing representing Tangier anyway was the fish.
I don't think it would have made a difference if Evan did the task. And if it did make a difference it wouldn't have been because of the magnifying glass. None of us recognized that image as from Prague (even the ones who did the roadblock). We all made the association to the diamond detour, despite not doing it. We knew you needed to view a diamond through a magnifying glass, but since none of us did the task, we had no idea what it actually looked like. Every other image (besides the bird from Bahrain) was something we physically interacted with in some way, shape or form, so the magnifying glass was a terrible choice. There were two other images for Prague as well. One of an animated beer in a bathtub and another of a map of Europe with a red dot on Prague. The issue for me was not about the images though. I address that on my blog this week.
Also, the piece that Henry changed at the end was the vertical stabilizer. He had the magnifying glass on his plane (it was on his propeller). The images he swapped out were Elephant (Thailand)/French Fry (Belgium) for Bats (Hong Kong)/BeerBath (Prague). But if he thought the magnifying glass was representing Belgium and he didn't think he had anything for Prague, it would have made sense. Then he ended up with two images from Prague & Hong Kong and none for Belgium & Thailand.
I wonder what was Henry & Evan responses (especially Henry) when he found out he was so close yet so far from the finish line just because of one minor mistake
How far were Henry and Evan and Kristi and Jen behind Cody and Jessica timewise? Is there any official answer to that?
Henry was about 10 minutes behind Jessica. I think he had one more wrong check before he got it right.
I was more than an hour after them. There was a detail of this puzzle that I got hung up on that the other teams didn't notice. Not sure if I was just supposed to not notice, but it hung me up BIG TIME...
That's really interesting to know since in the show you really lose track of the time lapses due to editing.
Well, I'll have you know that all of our family was rooting for you two in the finale, and you guys had a great run.

[MOD]Please use the full SKU and name of Reaper minis in the titles of your Show Off threads, per forum guidelines. You can find this information on the blister card or in the online store. I also like to give credit to the sculptor in a tag, so people can find their favorites.
We have a high volume of posts generated from this challenge, which is great! But it's also creating a lot of work for the mods. Ladystorm has already urged folks to comply with these guidelines.[/MOD]
As an experiment, this project has been moved to be a bi-monthly challenge last year, that seemed to have worked so until further notice that is our format. The longer time frame theoretically will give less stress to painting, and allow more complex jobs, and more sinister challenges.
Due to the variable nature of a CAV I compare them against a generic 28mm figure and the Avatar large figure. I take height and bulk into considering if it is worth 1 or 2 figures.
Much like last year, the idea is to help those of us that normally paint VERY little, to start painting more.
If your name is missing, or you believe your count is incorrect, please PM me. Please note: to make counts easier, you must post in the bi-monthly thread.
Again, I request that when tagging your posts, please use "RPChallenge" to help with locating minis from this.
Pretty certain at this point I fell off the wagon got ran over by it, then chased it down and set it on fire (given the drought of these - explanation is in the chatter thread)
Please see the main post here for rules, questions and general chatter, while using this thread to keep a list of links to your show-offs or show-off related comments in a single post: A reminder to please adhere to miniatures posting guidelines as usual.
October Bonus: This is Halloween! - Paint a mini using only colors that have black, orange, and purple in the name. You may also use "Fresh Blood" and "Spectral White" as they are part of the monthly promotion.
Hard mode: Jack-o-lantern's light - Paint a mini where the only source of light would be coming from inside a jack-o-lantern. Pumpkin may be part of the mini/base or sculpted
November Bonus: Festive feast - Since both US And Canada have their Thanksgiving in this time bracket - paint up a mini (figure or terrain) to have some food being presented
Hard mode: Liquid Cheer - This can be done with the above - paint a mini where it's holding a drinking vessel - but paint it as though the mug were glass and you could see the drink inside from the sides (in theme - ale or wine is the best use)
December Bonus: Winter Solstice - To celebrate the shortest day of the year - paint a halfling or dwarf decked in wintry colors (think blues/grays/whites, maybe brown and a little bit of evergreen)
I've made no secret about my opinions on Games Workshop. Though my painting box is full of their miniatures they were always bought second and sometimes third hand (I never wanted GW to get any of my money). Even my previous Cadians were bought from my local games store that has no affiliation with GW (I also know those sets and blisters came with the business when it was bought almost twenty years ago). Now I find myself in the unique position of building a Cadian army.
My wife and I used to play weekly in D&D Adventure League but with the birth of our first child it looks like that won't be possible (We want to continue gaming at our current store but its a bit of drive and the kid is at the rolling stage so she doesn't want to be held or sit in her seat; she wants to be on the floor and we all know what gameshop floors are like). I've offered to watch the child so she can go or to switch off each week but she only wants to go together. Gaming together has always been part of our relationship, and she doesn't want to lose that. I couldn't agree more, its good to share a hobby with your spouse.
That's when our friends started trying to recruit us to play Warhammer 40K with them. At first I was resistant but our friends get together often to play and in our area its always possible to find a game (Depending on the size it can be played fairly quickly in comparison to D&D too). After some discussion we decided 40K would give me something to paint, but it would also give us both something to play and eventually something to play together.
Which brings us to this new project. Since I figured watching me assemble miniatures would be pretty boring I'm starting this thread right before I prime them. So here is most of my assembled starter set (I've got quite a few cheap sets of bits arriving over the next couple weeks and I'm not exactly sure what unit I'd like to create next so that's why I have so many unfinished figures).
I'm still not a big fan of GW but having an excuse to see our friends more often is pretty nice. In a way we're kinda trading one gaming group for another (that sounds pretty mean but I think you understand what I'm saying).
I bought into the recent Terrain Crate Kickstarter; getting the Dungeon Crate, and the Battlefield Crate, along with the Dark Lord's Tower set. My Terrain Crate shipment arrived in the early Summer, and I immediately painted two of the large tents that came with the "Campsite" portion of the Battlefield Crate to use in a game I did at Historicon. Recently, I've been painting some of the "Abandoned Mine" stuff from the Dungeon Crate, as I am preparing for a game a friend and I are doing at Fall-In using our Tablescapes Dungeon Mines sets.
I thought I'd start a thread to chronicle the pieces I paint, to help me keep track, and to help keep me motivated to keep plowing through. There's a lot of pieces! I hope to use a bunch of it in my Fall-In game, so have some motivation there as well.
I'm new here, though I have been a lurker for many years at this point. I used to be quite into painting and sculpting miniatures but took a break when I went to college and I want to get back into it. I've backed bones 4 so I figured I should start warming up for it!

According to media reports, as of November Manitoba has given Winnipeg 27 years to clean up its act regarding sewage currently being dumped into the Red River en route to Lake Winnipeg.
As I see the events that have taken place, and are currently taking place, in the province, this is my best answer: "There will be a provincial election in about two years and the Pallister government doesn’t want to lose any of its big-city support. It’s basically a political move and don’t-rock-the boat syndrome. Free rein to further expand the already gluttonous hog industry, appeasing the Manitoba Pork Council and the city residents by all means, votes garnered in their favour."
Hey. So does anybody have tips for getting clothes cleaned whilst traveling? I no some hostels have facilities, but I am not sure. if i will be in one place long enough to di it.do most travelers throw away as they travel and replace?
what i gathered from reading a lot of topics is that people either wait and find a laundry mat or take a plug, wondersoap and do their washing in sinks, I plan on doing the second option
Can’t comment directly for top deck but imagine it would be the same/similar… Did a contiki trip last year, most places we stayed at had laundry facilities, some even had a service where you could pay to get it done… took 24 hours to get back, but was well worth it… a lot of people waited to get to those locations… as some of the top deck places are the same (we ran into top deck at some places) should be similar…
hi, i just got back from travelling for 3 months and did not pay a penny for laundry, i bought my own bar of soap and used sinks everywhere, some places have machines but can get costly depending how long your travelling, you can save a lot of money by doing it this way
I’ve just come back from a 36 day Topdeck Euroclub trip, I would recommend taking heaps of knickers then you only have to do washing a few times as you get a few wears out of everything else, you could just do washing in you sink but there is not always room to hang it to dry, I didn’t take a lot of clothes and I managed to do washing about 4 times in 36 days, one other thing I would recommend is doing your washing in 3’s or 4’s as the machines are usually huge and you get charged the same no matter how big the load is, makes it a lot cheaper!
It really depends what tour you are doing. Hotels trips are generally the hardest to find laundry facilities as they don’t offer them or if they do they tend to be very expensive dry cleaning services. If you are doing Euroclub or Camping trips, facilities are a lot easier to find but not always guaranteed especially in countries less travelled, facilities will be hard to find. On trips that are 2-4 weeks long, Italy is usually around half way & there are usually lots of facilities there for Camping, Euroclub & Eurohotel (you might have to walk a bit from the hotel). Handwashing is great & means that you won’t miss out on a city because you have to do laundry. Take some travel wash, a sink plug & something to hang your stuff on & i would definately recommend taking underwear that’ll last you at least 2 weeks.
Thanks for the tips, ill definitely be taking a plug and washing powder! heres a portable clothes line if anyone else is interested in taking one and its cheap as! http://www.anaconda.com.au/Product/Camp-and-Hike/Accessories/TravelClothesLine
my aim is, if we’re in a country for 2 days, then i wont be going site seeing until ive done my washing. more important to have clean clothes.
There are always laundry mats and such around, but also bring a plug, travel washing liquid, and pegs (and travel clothes line if you want) incase you are stuck with no clean undies and have to do an emergancy wash:)
Hey guys! I’m heading off to Europe in January, yay! Just wondering with the travel clothes lines - do people just hang these in the dorms or leave them in the bathrooms? I can’t imagine hanging them outdoors in winter would be very effective? Thanks heaps! RenÃ©
see the sites in the morning and then head back to where your staying, ask your tour leader where the best laundramat is because they probably will be needing to do washing too. we did our washing on out 2 night stays.
My clothesline had both suction cups & hooks so you could either find somewhere to hook it on in the room (drawer handles/lights above the bed etc), or simply suction it to the window.
I also had paper travel wash which was super handy & hardly took up any space at all - all you do it throw a few sheets of it in with your washing.
I still spent heaps of money on washing, but there was about 9 days where there was nowhere to wash clothes so handwashing came in very handy. Also on my hotel tour there was no laundry so instead of spending time trying to find a laundromat, washing in the sink left plenty of time to see more sights
of soap in bathroom when i go for a bath. For ironing I put my clothes below my bed and jump, give pressure.
In summer, I washed my clothes with soap while I was in the shower, wrung them out and hung around my bunk (items like undies and socks that NEED to be washed regularly) And if I was in location long enough I would do the same with my pants and tops. During winter then can be hard, or easier, depends how you see it. They have great heaters in the rooms that’ll dry your clothes in no time, if you in location long enough, otherwise just pay for a laundromat.
This thread's purpose is to share each other list for recommended anime-mangas and which anime-manga you're following currently. So, here's mine.
Here's a list and short description of what I'm currently watching (they can all be found on crunchyroll):
Fairy Tail - a fun, light-hearted show about magic and guilds with lovable characters that will grow on you.
Cross Ange: Rondo of Angel and Dragon - At first glance it seems like a reverse/same-sex harem but it's really a mech action show with great music (main character is a badass, just give her a chance!)
Parasyte -the maxim- I was really grossed out after watching the first episode, but this show is deep! It's what I would call a "surprise" action show. It's intense! It might even pull on your heart strings a bit.
When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace - This is a show about a few good-natured junior high students who accidentally inherit super powers! Note: Not really an action show, it's more about the characters and their development. You'll LOVE the main character.
World Break: Aria of Curse for a Holy Swordsman - Hard to describe this one, it's your typical fantasy action show, with fan-service, and a pretty standard plot. Regardless, it's still really good. A must-watch for action fans.
Magic Kaito 1412 - A show about a Phantom Thief (a magician who announces what he will steal in advance). A must-watch for people who enjoy magic tricks.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure - An over-the-top show about a young man's quest to avenge a tragic family death. It's VERY stylish...and if you're big into music, you'll appreciate the songs in the end credits.
Kinda ran into it randomly. It's is an odd take on Sega Vs. Nintendo But its pretty cool It makes me sad that the character that represent Link is kinda twisted. Not to mention the character that represents Tetris is very dirty minded.
Never argue with a Noob.... They only bring you down to their level and beat you with their experience.
I mostly follow and download what's currently on season. It's exciting since there aren't any spoilers online and there's always stuff to talk about with like-minded people. If I'm in the mood to watch an older anime, I tend to just stream it.
I usually watch anime for their story and what they have to offer. Any anime that's somewhat good I will watch, but when there a story that doesn't explain itself it cringe.
Gakkou Gurashi is what I'm currently watching right now and I plan to add more in the future. Right now I'm just trying to finish what I sarted.
You gave Haruhi a 6! hahaha... May I know why? I'm part of the fanatic fanbase that foam in the mouth and would lick Haruhisama's shoes if she wanted.
Higurashi no naku koro ni - very dark an confusing at first. If you can make it to the second season it all makes sense - and gets even darker
Noctureon wrote: You gave Haruhi a 6! hahaha... May I know why? I'm part of the fanatic fanbase that foam in the mouth and would lick Haruhisama's shoes if she wanted.
I was still finishing the series. I haven't really update the score on the go as I usually update the score at the very end and sometimes in the middle.
It was a rough ride for the series early on, but the storyteling technique with Kyon narrating was just amazing. Any moment that was not interesting was filled up with his voice and his way of thinking, which lets us relate to the main character, which is amazing. I can't recall if any other animes have done this, but this is gold.
Story wise, it sets itself up really good for many reveals, but it's one of those animes that doesn't really get anywhere and instead has several scenarios where the main characters deal with. What does get somewhere is the relationships between the characters and the viewer. Towards the end when they were making their Mikuru film, that was when I realized I really love the characters that the anime has built up on.
Yes, you get really attached to them! That is what's so amazing about this series. You start caring about each member of the SOS Brigade.
Are you watching it in chronological order or broadcast order? It's gonna have a different vibe and ending for both orders. Broadcast order makes it a little wonky for binge watching, it's better to watch it once a day or once a week, but the story ends perfectly and your brain kinda figured out by itself which episodes are connected with each other. Chronological order has a weaker ending, imho.
Noctureon wrote: Yes, you get really attached to them! That is what's so amazing about this series. You start caring about each member of the SOS Brigade.
the really messed up episode where Haruhi tries to destroy the world and the day is saved by Kyon taking Haruhi by the shoulder and kisses her hard.
Akagami no Shirayuki hime, i'm reading the manga also and now that the anime started airing i'm really having big hopes for it
Dungeon ni Deai wo Motomeru no wa Machigatteiru Darou ka, i'm not even sure if i'll ever finish this, lol. At first it was sort of interesting but it's becoming quite cliche
i keep randomly picking up interesting ones and reading them and noticing that they've been dropped years ago D:
Ghost Hunt, omg this is probably my all time favorite series. the characters are awesome and it's really interesting. supernatural/mystery/horror-ish
Chrno Crusade, even though it's not quite as good as the manga it gives a few good feels. adventure/shounen/comedy
Akatsuki no Yona, a really great manga that got an anime adaptation earlier this year i think. adventure/romance/comedy/shoujo/historical
Samurai Deeper Kyo, old but gold. My all time favorite. It's quite long, 300 chapters, but it never got boring. adventure/shounen/comedy/historical
Groove Adventure Rave, earlier series from the creator of fairy tail. My own favorite basic nakama-power shounen series. nakama-power/adventure/fantasy/shounen
An anime I overlooked for a while was Barakamon. I didn't think it looked interesting at first glance, but I noticed it popping up in more people's "top lists" so I decided to finally check it out. It only took me a day to finish, was hooked on it. If you want an original slice of life, I'd give it a try.
I can't write a decent summary without making it look bad but what is so nice about it is that most of the feelings, emotions and etc aren't said with words but with facial expressions, reactions and the notorious ( mostly funny ) inner monologue of the pessimistic Main Character. Events can be interpreted in many ways, and there's always a lot of discussion on it after each volume or episode comes out.
He helps with other people's problems with methods 'destroys' himself resulting in social suicide, with the reasoning that his methods don't hurt anyone else because he doesn't matter to anyone. So, it is perfectly fine but little does he know that he has many people that support and really treasure him too. I won't continue as I may spoil more things

There was this episode where there was a young girl that had a similar mentality as the protagonist, pretty much anti-social, pessimistic, despairing over modern society, and they were kinda getting along just being their general selves and despairing, ahahah xD. I don't remember how it went exactly but later on he kinda alienated himself from her so she could make friends, while making her disdain him, that kinda made me sad. q.q

D: Why would you do that to your twin?! I still rmb the part where Rika's insides were pulled out on the shrine's table D: That's the worst for me
Haruhi was really good! Which also resulted in soooo many people cosplaying as Haruhi even in a country which has a really small community as mine.
Haruhi was so much fun! I watched it a long time ago but it feels like it was my introduction, along with Lucky Star, to the slice of life comedy kind of genre. Even though it's very much a fantasy-- scifi-- Mystery-- Aliens, Time Travelers, and Espers kind of thing.
P.S. I started watching Nagi no Asakura and that anime is a moving picture! I mean it's got some serious huge eye syndrome which is something I'm totally into.
I feel a certain way about this kind of story though. I'm basically like "If I wanted to re-experience being terrible at girls like in high school, I'd just act like I did when I was in highschool! I don't need an anime for that!" I'm still chancing going further though, I'm only at episode 1 and it's already interesting.

"I'm astounded at the the number of windows search engines open up to finding new material on the Web"
You should understand what search engines are, identify different types of searching tools, and be able to use them effectively to find the best information possible.
Well, if you keep in mind that there are over 5 billion documents that make up the World Wide Web, no one single tool will help you find what you are looking for in your life time. The Internet is so deep, and most people are using the Internet as if they were digging a giant hole with a toothpick. By learning about different searching tools, people can quickly and effectively search the Internet, and find the most reliable, credible, and timely information out there.
Search engines (e.g., altavista.com, google.com) are databases of documents, sound files, graphics, etc., that allow you to find references to topics you are interested in by submitting keywords. Search directories (e.g., yahoo.com) usually allow users to find information through lists of categories. Meta-search engines (dogpile.com) are not databases; rather, they search the databases of the most popular search engines and then send a list of results of each back to you.
There are also a number of specialized search tools for finding detailed information like biographies, quotations, facts and figures, and images, word definitions. Rather than using general search engines that can a little of everything, these search tools are often created by experts in their fields, and the information can be more credible, providing reference to original sources.
Different search engines rank and categorize sites differently. Some have people (human editors) who evaluate each site; others use computer robots or "spiders" to do this job. Because there millions of pages record in search engine databases, some of the results may not be exactly related to what you are looking for and may be used out of context.
Here are several steps you might follow when researching a topic. For this example, you want to find out which university Michael Jordan attended.
What words could you use in this search? Of course, you could use the phrase, "Michael Jordan," but you could look up other related words like basketball, university, college, etc.
Different search engines have different features. There are also some specialized searching tools. The more you learn and experiment with them, the better you will become in finding the information you are looking for. Here are only a few of the more popular ones:
Google: Ranks sites based on how many other sites link to it, but it doesn't identify which sources are more authoritative and accurate.
Ixquick: Identifies sites that appear in the top ten rankings of other search engines. You can also search for mp3 audio files and pictures.
ZapMeta: A cool tool that shows the results in terms of relevance (related to your search keywords), popularity (determined by the number of Websites that links to yours), and title (alphabetical order). It will also help you identify the creator of the site and will link you to past versions of the site.
Converts works on a webpage to links so you can look the meaning up in a dictionaries and other reference materials
A free online encyclopedia in many languages that even allows you to edit the material. Probably not as accurate since anyone can make changes to it, but people can also discuss the article.
A online encyclopedia that even provides the source of its information. Great for starting research.
Most database indexing and searching are based on the principals of Boolean logic, named after the British mathematician George Boole. The three basic terms used are: AND, NOT, and OR. If you understand how to use these terms effectively when searching, you will have better results. Here is basically how they work:
You want to research the relationship between diet and health. Results must contain all of these words. Results will include references with only "diet" or only "health." diet AND health
You want information on cars, but you don't want anything on trucks. Results will include only information on only cars, but not trucks. cars NOT trucks
If you are looking for a particular phrase, names of people, or titles of songs or books, enclose them in quotation marks like "Silent Night" in this example.
Try to find the answer to this question by using one of the search engines. When you find authoritative information, write down: (1) the name of the site, (2) the URL, (3) the answer to the question.

Phrog and Bryan Little probably have more 'gauge' experience than the rest of us combined. Also Logan in Oklahoma researched a bunch of them before he installed his. There are a few others locally who have changed their gauges during restoration as well, including "Tiny" (Alan Garcia) in Bridgeport, who made his entire dashboard look like a spaceship at night.
They have been getting good feedback on Z31P so I think I might order some up, but still any input is appreciated!
Autometers will do well in a pinch, but the revo gauges I've got are simply the creme de la creme compared to everything else I've seen.
I have prosports in my Z and have for several years (boost/vacuum and oil pressure). I think they are great and offer a more reasonably priced alternative to the Autometer, Speedhut, Etc.. Those are all great gauges and if you have the coin then by all means, but these work just fine and look great. If you will be at the meet this Sat in Middletown feel free to poke your head in to take a look.
Those speedhut gauges look pretty good and come in the 2 5/8 size i want but they are a little too pricey for me atm.
been able to delve into this yet as to what the problem is. 1st, I don't think I have a stock tank. My 260 was a Canadian delivery. The tank only holds about 13 gals. I know my original 240 held 15.9. I saw somewhere british
I have. Are there any identification nos. on fuel tanks? One thing I know is the tank bands run back to front, not side to side. This may be due to the mods done with the cage etc. I hope to get into this this winter. Last years
I've been using them in my car since last summer and have had no problems with them. Good gauges for the price
Also, I never did get any answers of fuel tanks. I'm having fuel gauge issue looked at now, I know sender is sending a signal as gauge moves, albeit only between 3/4 and full. Leads me to believe gauge is wrong ohms for sender.
QC was in reference to prosport. They tend to be inaccurate. The senders are junky. I was looking into them for a while and then I finally gave up.
Like someone said, they haven't had an issue, but I know people who have had issues. Mostly with gauge needle position and junk senders.
haven't heard that many complaints from people with AM, speedhut, DEFI, stewart warner... etc. Speedhut doesn't seem to be that expensive. You can get a whole cluster for around $800. The AM set i was looking into was over $1200.

Tried to export my team to use in a friends xbox exported team fine butbwhen I goto import the team I keep getting the load data not found error even tho if I try to import on my own xbox it shows my team fine kinda stuck here
That's what in trying to do but o can export a team fone but when I go to import it the xxbox can't find the saved team
Maybe because he is using a different option file or something? I presume it's Rangers or someone from the SPL/SFL file you're trying?

On your mate's console, are you logged in using the same account as when you first exported the team?
Import team and choose the memory stick but it tells us there is no load data found Nd no team there
Try downloading your profile and logging into that. It's not the perfect system but I think that, once assigned, Import teams can only be used by just the one profile.

As the Minotaur went down on one knee, and the other one was destroyed, Bartholomew acted quickly: going off of what he had seen earlier about the effects of the preservative fluid, the Beetle man grabbed a jar of the explosive stuff and then ripped one of his arm wrappings off.
After inserting the cloth into the bottle, he then lit it via one of the burning corpses on the floor and then yelled "Metallon! Get out of the way!"
Basim then threw the makeshift bomb at the insectoid abomination, hoping that it would do some damage. If it didn't, he prepared to attack with his Scimitar and Dirk.
Rona blinked, seemingly unable to believe what was happening around her. Fen found himself hoping she could cope with that.
"I... I can't do much," she said to the pixie. "I can pray, and hope the gods answer, but I... Wait! Where is the half-elf who took my dagger - Kyle? The dagger is holy! It's an artifact of Vesta, from my days as a priestess in her temple. It might help! But, I'll try calling upon Astra as well..."
“R-right!” Ambreeze agreed, the vast majority of that information going right over his head. Holy stuff hurt demonic stuff, that much he’d picked up from… somewhere. That was important. It was just a shame the thing was a dagger and not a pike. Or a minotaur-scaled warhammer.
While the pixie was wishing for better luck, Rona set him down on one of the nearby tables before raising her hands up toward the heavens and beginning to chant. Her voice was clearer than before, the words louder. But it seemed to be a long prayer, and it might take some time. Fen vaguely found himself wondering if he could just sit still and enjoy the view, but it wasn’t just the sickly smell of rot coming from the table he was on that urged him to move. Wincing and inhaling sharply, Ambreeze managed to get to his feet despite the pain he suffered, taking stock of the situation.
They’d wiped out most of the smaller ‘golems’, and he’d seen - hell, he’d felt - the cyclops’s demise. The armored insectoid abomination was still raging, though, preparing to attack again… and there was no telling what it might hit. Barty the beetleman was busy trying to make flaming alchemical cocktails and hurl them at the monster, and the others seemed to be weighing their options. Considering the only one really posing a threat at the moment was Rona, it didn’t take long for Ambreeze to decide to focus on protecting her.
Well, he was going to cover her, anyway, but he decided working on his excuses now rather than later was a good idea.
As he began to focus his will and conjure his Gift, Fen quickly came up with an even better idea. Deciding the creature was almost definitely too stupid to really notice the difference, he conjured an illusion of himself at full health, and directed it to dart straight toward the creature. Pouring all of his knowledge and skill into the illusion, Ambreeze also attempted to make it send illusory fire blasts at the monster, though he knew that would do no damage.
((Summary: cast Illusory Image to create a double, then make it actively distract the remaining abomination))
Kyle was about to rush in headlong and aid Metallon, but he caught sight of Bartholomew preparing some kind of bomb - and then he shouted for Metallon to move aside. His keen ears, however, had caught something of interest...
"I can pray, and hope the gods answer, but I... Wait! Where is the half-elf who took my dagger - Kyle? The dagger is holy! It's an artifact of Vesta, from my days as a priestess in her temple. It might help! But, I'll try calling upon Astra as well..."
She then began to chant. Kyle drew the golden dagger from his belt and gripped it tightly as he steeled himself. Once Bartholomew's bomb was thrown and finished, he charged in, aiming for whatever he could reach of it, be it its arm or even its torso... as long as he could find a good weak point to stab in the holy dagger ((Critical Strike)).
Kairn couldn't help cracking a smile when he heard his knife crack deep into the skull, only to have it wiped away when the cyclopean hulk pitched forward. That had been one of his favorite daggers. Now, it wasn't worth retrieving. Insofar as he was concerned, nothing was worth digging through that undead mass grave, even a knife he'd had for at least a decade. There had to be enough good steel in the world that he could replace it. Or, failing that - it was a genuinely good blade, and good blades weren't that easy to find - he'd settle for something throwable.
Even more shameful, he'd have to attribute killing the thing to someone else. After all, he was merely here to document things. As a general rule, it was in poor taste for bards to poeticize themselves too much. That was the whole point of invoking muses - not that Kairn really put much stock in them, though failing to acknowledge them was improper-
He shook his head, blinking. This was another trick - the shadows from before slipping through, distracting him, making him think about anything but the task at hand. That, or he'd gone far too long without a decent nap.
As he approached the other beast and took up a defensive stance - better to let it make the wrong move - he hoped his momentary distraction was the latter.
Metallon's hammers hit nothing but air, but the armored creature wasn't as unlock, swatting the minotaur with its tail and making him stagger away. He snorted and turned to face the monstrosity again. It would regret not hitting him harder.
However before he attacked, Metallon saw Kairn's dagger sail through the air and cheered as it embedded in the skull of the cyclopian beast, shattering the rune and felling it instantly. "Excellent throw!" Metallon roared, bolstered with confidence. "One to go!"
He was about to charge back in when he heard Basim yell. "Metallon! Get out of the way!" The Minotaur glanced towards him to see him lobbing some kind of explosive at the monster. Didn't have to warn him twice. Metallon backed up, coming close to one of the few flaming undead abominations left. Not one to sit by idly, Metallon backed up and swung his hammer downwards in a low arc, crashing into the creature and sending it's flaming carcass soaring towards the armored behemoth.
It went straight for Kairn, who fortunately was prepared for the attack. When the armored scorpion-tail-arm came swinging toward him, he dodged aside, deflecting the brunt of the blow with his bastard sword. But he wasn't fully prepared for the creature's unnatural strength, and the tip of its stinger still cut a nasty, deep gash into his side - and he could tell from the burning pain that the wound was poisoned.
Beside the half-elf, the fox-man Vehoe let out a terrified wail and stumbled backward, holding his head. The horrific sight of the death and torture all around him was too much for his mind. He felt the Darkness seeping into his soul, and he could not will himself to fight on.
Bartholomew lobbed a firebomb made from a bottle of preservative fluid at the monster. It struck its chest and shattered, spilling a stream of burning liquid down the abomination's side. But although the fluid continued to burn, it did not spread to the rest of the creature - even when Metallon sent a burning corpse smashing into it. The hulking brute seemed to be protected against fire, unlike the lesser creations.
As Rona continued her chanting, Fen sent an illusion of himself flying up to the monster's face, casting bursts of false flame. But the abomination - which clearly did not fear fire - ignored it as one would ignore an insect.
As instructed, Kyle drew Rona's holy ritual dagger and charged in, aiming for a critical spot between the Abomination's plates of armor. At the last moment, he leaped into the air, driving the knife deep into a crack in the armor right where a normal beast's heart would be.
Then Rona finished her prayer and opened her eyes, the blue of which seemed to shine in the dim light. Whether this was linked to what happened next, or whether the effects of Kyle's precision strike were merely delayed, no one could be sure. But a faint light began to emanate from the cracks in the monster's armor, concentrated around the embedded holy knife. As the glowing fissures grew brighter, the abomination threw back its head and screamed - a horrific wail like the cry of a dozen lost souls at once. The ancient flesh of the beasts that had been sewn together to make it started to burn away into smoke and ash, and the rest came tumbling and crashing down. The sound of it echoed through the entire castle... and then died away.
With all of the undead monsters dead again, the world seemed to fall silent. Rona ran a hand through her messy brown hair and glanced at Fen, her face showing uncertainty about what had just happened. The others all exchanged glances as well. All except poor Mastus, who still lay on the floor, unmoving. He did not draw breath.
After a moment of silence for their fallen comrade, Vsskyre sidled over to Rona and said in a low voice - almost a whisper: "Excuse me, but do you think you could translate this book? I cannot read the words."
"I can try," said the young Templar, taking the ancient tome. "It may take me a little while. I know prayers in Old Achaean, but I'm not very good at reading it. I wish Mastus was still here to help... I'm sorry about him - about your friend. I would say some words for him, but I do not know-"
With that, she strode over to Mastus's body and closed his lifeless eyes, and started to chant in a low tone, reciting the words of an ancient Minotaur funerary rite, as well as she could remember them.
Everyone looked around at the room, now silent save for Vsskyre's soft chanting. Down the stairs ahead was a great wooden door, covered in scratch and bite marks from the teeth and claws of the shambling dead creatures that had been trying to get through it. It apparently would not be easy to pass. And the human party of dungeon explorers - if they were still alive - might expect pursuit from that direction.
In the now empty cells once inhabited by the hulking abominations, however, there appeared to be another passage: two enormous cages held aloft by heavy chains, with winches to raise and lower them. Perhaps they could be used to reach the lower levels more quickly. But the winches were held in place by thick, rusty iron padlocks, and there was no telling where the keys might be.
Abomination hits Kairn for 18(-9 due to defensive stance)=9 damage, inflicts POISON (-2 health per round until cured)
As the moth-woman went to treat Mastus's corpse, Kyle frowned. It was a shame Mastus was dead, and that was regretful - but he'd wasted a bandage on that minotaur. Not that he meant to be heartless, but survival was for the strong, and he'd wasted some valuable resources on the weak. It wasn't a mistake he planned to make twice.
"If we even could get through that door," he commented, gesturing toward the wooden one bearing so many marks from the abominations they'd killed, "the Imperials have probably set more traps than some of us could survive. Start looking around - maybe we can find the keys to these locks... or else just smash the damn things."
Kyle wandered quietly through the room, glancing around and attempting to make some observations about where the keys could be - or any potential clues leading to their whereabouts. As he did, he occasionally sniffed the air to try and find any wayward scents of interest. Perhaps he could detect if the human party had already passed this way - and if they had indeed taken the large door covered in scratches.
The Beetle-man glanced at Mastus before looking away, it was not a pretty sight. It was a shame that the Minotaur was dead, but he was glad that he wasn't the one who was lying there with their head bashed in.
The Minotarian chant, however, was beautiful. He could not understand all the words, but the lyrics he could understand filled him with a love for the wild, rolling planes that the Minotaurs inhabited, not to mention other species: the planes that the Empire wished to seize.
"If we even could get through that door, the Imperials have probably set more traps than some of us could survive. Start looking around - maybe we can find the keys to these locks... or else just smash the damn things."
Bartholomew glanced at Rona, and then looked at Metallon and asked "Well, what do you think? Should we go after the Imperials, or go a different way?"
Well, most of us. Fen thought, briefly glancing at Mastus’s corpse. He almost wish he could say the minotaur had died valiantly, but that had unfortunately not been the case. The pixie sighed, gingerly attempting flight but letting out a small cry as the rapid motion of his wings simply irritated his burns. He let out a soft moan, but that wasn’t his only method of travel. He just really didn’t like the other, and wasn’t sure what Rona would think of a significantly larger version of himself.
Rather than grow just yet, Ambreeze decided to address the strange mental scars the hellfire had left behind, half-closing his eyes as he searched for his inner peace. As he did, though - or rather, tried - he couldn’t help but keep watching Rona. She seemed troubled, and that didn’t help her attempt to translate a book.
A few long moments passed, before Fen decided to speak up. “Uh… need a hand there, with anything?” He called from his seat on the torture table.
As Kyle Bloodmoon searched the room, recruiting some of the others to help, Rona continued her attempts to read and translate the ancient tome they had found.
"This is disgusting," she said as she ran her finger down the lines of text. "The mage-lord who owned this castle... He was trying to unlock the source of the 'raw physical power' of beastfolk... Those things we fought... They were his experiments. He tried grafting parts of different beastfolk together, or grafting them onto men... and when the subject died, he would just... bring them back to life. He only stopped when he found some other subject to research. The text mentions great black wings, but then the pages are burnt... I can't read anymore..."
The half-elf werewolf had just pried this bit of treasure from the claw of a long-dead skeleton in the corner of the room. He sprinted over to the elevator to try it on the chain tying down the winch, and to everyone's amazement, it actually worked. With a loud, shrill clangor that seemed to echo through the whole world, the chains fell to the ground. Metallon and Sven walked onto the lift to work the winch, and the others squeezed in after them. It was a tight fit, but the chains seemed to have no problem with the weight. Once the two strong beastfolk began turning the great winch, the elevator began its noisy descent...
Although the lift ride went smoothly for our intrepid party of Minoan allies, their quest was far from over. Through the darkest bowels of the dungeon they proceeded, first descending a winding stone ramp that was carved around the circumference of the deep, dark pit that extended down from the castle above seemingly into the heart of the earth itself. The journey was a precarious one, as each member of the party felt tempted to gaze into that yawning abyss, but knew that they should not...
And then they lost Sven. At one point, the path grew too narrow... and the hulking centaur could not cross. He tried his best, but first one hoof slipped, and then another. Kyle and Bartholomew rushed to his aid, but once his entire equine lower torso slipped over the edge, they could not handle its great weight, and Metallon could not get there in time to help. Down fell the mighty centaur, screaming seemingly all the way... or so it sounded, for it took many long minutes for the echoes of his cries to die out. Many of the others had to cover their ears from the horrific sound.
On they trudged. The hardest challenge they encountered was a flock of bat-like creatures - possibly demons - that ascended from the darkness. The monsters swarmed about their heads, clawing and biting... and it was more than Vehoe could take. Screaming in terror, he shouted: "It's over! We're lost! WE'RE LOST!" Then he ran off down a side tunnel, chased by the beasts, which seemed to sense the madness that had settled in his mind.
Working together, the others cleared out the creatures. Basim used his poison spray, Fen set the air ablaze, and the rest hacked and slashed through the stragglers. They chased after Vehoe, hoping to find him... but they never did.
By the time they reached the bottom of the winding stair, they were no longer in the realm of mortals. They were somewhere just beyond, in the domain of those who lurked below...
Hopefully its on May 12 because April 28 would be competing against Danny Jacobs on HBO. Makes sense to be on ESPN since Golden Boy has a contract with them as well.
Top Rank chairman Bob Arum told ESPN on Monday that talks are underway for them to meet in the main event of a Top Rank ESPN card on either April 28 or May 12 at a site to be determined.
Arum said he has been discussing the bout with Teiken Promotions' Akihiko Honda, the leading Japanese promoter, whom Arum has known for decades and who co-promotes Linares with Golden Boy Promotions.
"I've been talking to Mr. Honda for a month about the possibility of Linares-Lomachenko," Arum said. "But I had to wait for Linares to fight on Saturday night and see how things turned out. Well, the kid won. Now we can discuss terms for the fight. I'm waiting to hear back from Honda.
"Knowing Honda, he'll probably ask for the terms he wants and we'll work that out, and then he would have me contact Golden Boy for the provision of services contract and to work out the other stuff, like tickets, travel, those details. So far in my conversations with Honda, everything is proceeding nicely, so we'll see."
Arum said, according to Honda, it is a fight Linares is very interested in -- and the same goes for Lomachenko and his manager, Egis Klimas.
BoxingScene has already reported this. Stop pushing that fat friend of yours (Fat Dan). The only inside scoop he has is at Baskin-Robbins.
Let them counter-program Hearn. Would be enticing for the both of them (TR and GB). I bet that's the plan, or they dropped the ball.
i think arum thinks lomachenko, at this pt in his career will dominate everyone incl. linares and garcia
I think that this is a closer fight than people think. Obivously Linares has some question marks in his performance when I look at his past, and obviously Lomachenko is at the very peak of his game and he is just plain destructive. The tidal wave of money probably comes in for Lomachenko, but this is a legit fight and I really think that it will be competitive.
I see loma being more skilled and should have a fairly easy victory but linares size might come to play a little bit but he doesnt usually fight using his weight all that much...so easy fight for loma
In before Seano finds a way to shit on this fight and shit and Loma and state his opinion in a way that means if the outcome is anything besides a first round stoppage it must mean Loma is a huge pile of shit!
I agree Linares style is talor made for Loma, but this is quite a leap for Loma’s first fight at 135
Meh. Good enough fight. Linares is pretty inconsistent. Hard to imagine him putting it all together vs Lomachenko. I like this a lot more than the Rigondeaux fight though.
Man, I have to say I can't recall ever getting so personally riled that someone didn't like my favorite fighters. Even at the peak of Floyd/Pac nonsense.
Linares is probably the best fight out there other than Berchelt and Garcia (and they're not available). I'm of the opinion that Linares has mostly been feasting on mediocre fighters over the last little while at LW, but you can't deny that he has clearly separated himself as having the best resume at the weight right now.
Linares will be a bit bigger than Lomachenko and he is quick and relatively sharp technically (although, his defensive shortcomings evident earlier in his career aren't exactly gone). That could cause some Lomachenko a few issues early, but I doubt it will be too significant. It probably won't be very competitive after round 5 or 6.
If Linares can beat Campbell and Crolla I don’t see him having trouble with a midget like Lomachenko.
Linares does have flaws, but he's a seasonned guy with decent output and accuracy and he's been a lightweight for years. For a first fight at 135 it's not the easy way to go. Very good fight. Loma via some hard fought JD.

Okay so here is the story ladies and gentlemen. I am very long time tau player who is finally looking to branch out and start a second army. After much deliberation, thoughts, and posts on theoretical army lists I have decided to start an Ork army. This is a big list I am posting, and don&#39;t plan on buying everything up front, but this is how I would generally like to see it progress. So without further ado.....
My only question would be is shootas or choppaz on the Trukk Boyz? I know on the big squad in the Wagon will go with choppaz, but I am thinking shootas on the smaller trukk boy squads. I think it makes them more versatile, and more viable when sitting on objectives.
So I really like the theme of just having a seemingly insane amount of Ork armor screaming across the field. I see the list as a Bad Moon list, since who else can have enough teef to afford all this grate stuf? I really like the upredictablilty of the Trukks and the Looted Wagons. Makes the game so much more interesting for everybody involved.
However my question for everybody would be this. Is this too much armor? My friends and I play kinda of competitively, but only in our group of friends which is like 7 or 8 of us. We rarely if ever play in tournaments. Now, I actually think this army is horribly vulnerable with its low model count, but with presenting nothing but 14 pieces of armor I can see somebody getting grumpy.
I think the list looks great. I would change very little. Minor adjustments would be to take a rokkit off each battlewagon and add them to two trukks. Spreading out your rokkits lets you fire at more targets, and makes it harder for your opponent to silence them. Having two on a battlewagon seems like a waste since you can&#39;t fire both of them.
I would split the buggies into three groups of two instead of two groups of three. Will hurt you a little in kill point missions but will give you a lot more flexability.
I would make at least one trukk mob into shootas. I have a 1:5 ratio of shootas to sluggas, but I might change that to a 1:3. Shootas are just too good against enemy units you really don&#39;t want to charge like genestealers and bloodletters.
I&#39;m assuming that you are going to put the boss and mek with the nobs in their wagon? I would consider putting the warboss with the other wagon, or in one of the trukks. You&#39;ve got a lot of points being carried in that nob battlewagon, and I&#39;m sure your opponent will try their hardest to kill it. Overall great list though. You&#39;ve got the bare necessities and didn&#39;t waste points on shiny gear.
Thanks Scoutfox, I appreciate the comments. The splitting of the Warbuggies is actually for the best. I wrote the list at 2am and then posted it, so I didn&#39;t take the time to break things down.
I didn&#39;t think about the Rokkits on the Wagons, but my thought was that the wagons would rumble forward and disgorge their contents. After that they would sit tight and try to pick off vehicles. I also like the Big Shootas on the Trukks because with only 12 boys per squad I imagine having the 3 extra shots could make a slight difference before assault.
As far as where the Warboss and Big Mek Travel, I hadn&#39;t completely decided yet. For starters I was going to run them all together and see where it goes, but I am more than open to the idea of splitting them up.
Keep it coming folks, this is really my first serious attempt at an Ork list, so any ideas are welcome.
I&#39;ll be honest and say i only read one of them and i noticed you did the math wrong. So you may want to go back and redo the math for everything. Heres the one i saw
I&#39;m sorry but thats not 117 points im an orc player and i make trukks with da boyz and nob w/ klaw all the time and heres the more accurate point value
add them together and you&#39;ve got 142 and thats not including the big shoota and bosspole you have thats what another 10 points? so 152 total
He&#39;s got his values right. The trukks are listed separately, which makes sense since the are technically separate units, and you forgot the big shoota and bosspole in your calculations on the cost of the boyz. Read the entire list before you make comments about math. Also, this thread is near a month old, so you&#39;re teetering on necromancy. Watch it.

Ah, hence all the Volvo stuff on CL from who I assumed was you! Glad to hear you're all OK, sorry to hear about the 245.
Sounds like it's out of alignment alright. Might want to check the front end for issues too; no point doing a wheel alignment until after any repairs/new tires are done.
Depends on how far you're willing to go and how much you want to pay. Why does it need an alignment?

Identify a Washburn KC-600 | Reissue or Export Market Product? (with pictures) by KC-600 (General Discussion on Washburn Electric Guitars)
On May 22 researchers at Osaka University presented the first demonstration of cold fusion since an unsuccessful attempt in 1989 that has clouded the field to this day.
On May 22, researchers at Osaka University presented the first demonstration of cold fusion since an unsuccessful attempt in 1989 that has clouded the field to this day.
To many people, cold fusion sounds too good to be true. The idea is that, by creating nuclear fusion at room temperature, researchers can generate a nearly unlimited source of power that uses water as fuel and produces almost zero waste. Essentially, cold fusion would make oil obsolete.
However, many experts debate whether money should be spent on cold fusion research or applied to more realistic alternative energy solutions. For decades, researchers around the world have been simply trying to show that cold fusion is indeed possible, but they´ve yet to take that important first step.
Now, esteemed Physics Professor Yoshiaki Arata of Osaka University in Japan claims to have made the first successful demonstration of cold fusion. Last Thursday, May 22, Arata and his colleague Yue-Chang Zhang of Shianghai Jiotong University presented the cold fusion demonstration to 60 onlookers, including other physicists, as well as reporters from six major newspapers and two TV studios. If Arata and Zhang´s demonstration is real, it could lead to a future of new, clean, and cheap energy generation.
In their experiment, the physicists forced deuterium gas into a cell containing a mixture of palladium and zirconium oxide, which absorbed the deuterium to produce a dense "pynco" deuterium. In this dense state, the deuterium nuclei from different atoms were so close together that they fused to produce helium nuclei.
Evidence for the occurrence of this fusion came from measuring the temperature inside the cell. When Arata first injected the deuterium gas, the temperature rose to about 70° C (158° F), which Arata explained was due to nuclear and chemical reactions. When he turned the gas off, the temperature inside the cell remained warmer than the cell wall for 50 hours, which Arata said was an effect of nuclear fusion.
While Arata´s demonstration looked promising to his audience, the real test is still to come: duplication. Many scientists and others are now recalling the infamous 1989 demonstration by Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, who claimed to produce controlled nuclear fusion in a glass jar at room temperature. However, no one - including Fleischmann and Pons - could duplicate the experiment, leading many people to consider cold fusion a pseudoscience to this day.
But one witness at the recent demonstration, physicist Akito Takahashi of Osaka University, thought that the experiment should be able to be repeated.
"Arata and Zhang demonstrated very successfully the generation of continuous excess energy [heat] from ZrO2-nano-Pd sample powders under D2 gas charging and generation of helium-4," Takahashi told New Energy Times. "The demonstrated live data looked just like data they reported in their published papers [J. High Temp. Soc. Jpn, Feb. and March issues, 2008]. This demonstration showed that the method is highly reproducible."
In addition, researchers will have to repeat the experiment with larger amounts of the palladium and zirconium oxide mixture in order to generate larger quantities of energy.
Heres your solution to the worlds energy problems! If cold fusion works, it'll effectively revolutionize energy production/consumption, as well as world economies.
well the Oil marketing companies will spend Trillions of $s to throw this technology out of the picture.
The fusion reactor built in France is based on 'hot fusion', which requires high pressure and temperature for the reaction to take place. Cold fusion is essentially the same reaction at around room temperature and pressure, so it has obvious benefits.
@abdulsami: If this actually works, and its obviously receiving a lot of media attention, then oil companies will not have a lot of control over the situation. And I think these companies keep up with scientific advances, and I'm sure they plan for the future by diversifying their energy base. I'm sure they're not sitting there, hoping no one will develop a viable alternative energy source in the near future!
Problem is, there have been numerous attempts at cold fusion, all of which failed spectacularly after receiving media hype, and hence people are really skeptical and wary about similar claims now.
Cold fusion may be possible as it has not been proven (yet) as an impossibility. Still it is very very likely that this experiment is just a way to grab investor's money. Last time I read, if cold fusion could actually work, most of the energy problems on earth will get solved.

Nuclear reactors use fission and not fusion. Fission is breaking down of large unstable nuclei into smaller more stable nuclei while fusion is the other way round. In a nuclear reactor’s case, the large nuclei of uranium isotopes are broken down into smaller nuclei.
The concept is mind blowing and out right revolutionary. But guys we, the PAKISTANIS won't have to worry about cold fusion for at least a 100 years. Am I right? Of course I am!!
If cold fusion works. Its cheap plentiful energy for everyone. Pakistan could obviously benefit from it.
its cool...... i was just wondering abt sum thing like this cuz re-read angel and deamons empth-teen time

英文摘要 The purpose of this research was to investigate the implementation of technology-enhanced situated instruction for seventh grade students on mathematical learning motivation and achievement in a junior high school. It also examined the differences between the genders. To achieve research goal, the study adopted the “proportion” as topic in junior high school, and developed e-learning materials with situated leaning concept. The situated learning was adopted as the teaching method, which refers to theories of Cognitive Apprenticeship and Anchored Instruction, and connects the students with daily situations in these materials.
The study used an experimental design method. Subjects were two similar groups in a complete school located in New Taipei City: one control group and one experimental group. They were randomly assigned into two groups, and each group contains two classes. Pre-testing and post-testing were adminstered, and the two groups received a four-week traditional instruction and technology-enhanced situated instruction in this study separately. The results were as follows:
a.	The experimental group performed better on the learning motivation than the control one obviously.
b.	The experimental group also performed better on the learning achievement than the control one obviously.
c.	For the experimental group, the male students displayed stronger motivation than the other gender while the female achieved higher scores in the test subject achievement on average.
d.	As for the control one, there was no significant difference between the genders in the aspect of learning motivation and achievement.
According to the results, the conclusion was provided some useful suggestions for the teachers in math field and prospective researchers.

• Two members of the Paja Formation are recognized, the Arcillolitas abigarradas (Barremian–Aptian; 480 m thick) and Arcillolitas con nodulos huecos (Aptian; 80 m thick; Fig. 1; Etayo-Serna 1968; Guerrero 2002a, b). Macrofossils are for the most part preserved in calcareous concretions; the part of this formation richest in fossil vertebrates appears to be the Barremian–Aptian aged Arcillolitas abigarradas Member (Etayo-Serna 1968). The Arcillolitas abigarradas forms extensive natural outcrops in the area around Villa de Leyva (Fig. 1). Ammonites are exceptionally abundant and three-dimensionally preserved in this region. Thus, relative age is constrained primarily by ammonite biostratigraphy, relying heavily on the zonation scheme proposed by Etayo-Serna (1968) and refined by subsequent authors (Patarroyo 2000; Hoedemaeker 2004). Correlation between Colombian (Caribbean Subprovince, Tethyan Realm) and European (Mediterranean Subprovince, Tethyan Realm) ammonite zones has been attempted based on genera and even species shared between the two regions (Patarroyo 2000; Hoedemaeker 2004; Kakabadze et al. 2004). These include species of Nicklesia, Pulchellia, Heinzia, Pseudohaploceras, Colchidites, Cheloniceras, Acanthohopclites, Colombiceras and Dufrenoyia, among others (Etayo-Serna 1968; Patarroyo 2000; Hoedemaeker 2004; Kakabadze et al. 2004).

These house flags from a ships directory chart published by the Japanese government and appearing in the brochure/book Fune to Hata (Ships and Flags) published by the Nihon Maru Memorial Foundation in 1994 following an exhibit at the Yokahama Maritime Museum by the same name and during the same year. Photocopies of the charts were provided by Nozomi Kariyasu for these images.. Three charts are devoted to Japanese flags.
The images in the photocopies are small, therefore only 34 are either not repeated or are of enough clarity to allow their representation. In some instances, the location of objects on the flag are the best approximation available.

If you are a man, you are already aware of the fact that endurance exercise improves your overall health, but did you know that it can also improve your sensual life?
According to Pete McCall, an exercise psychologist and personal trainer at the American Council on Exercise, men who work out 3 – 4 times at the gym will be gifted with a better sensual life. He recommends five exercises to improve your sensual prowess which can keep your lady love wanting for more.
Apart from so many other factors that influence your libido, your sensual drive also depends heavily on the testosterone levels that you carry. Low testosterone affects your sensual drive, penile erections or tumescence, and also lead to infertility. Weight training in combination with push-ups, situps, and abs exercises increases your testosterone level as well as your stamina. It strengthens the upper and lower body muscles which are used during sensualintercourse.
Kegel exercises strengthen the pelvic floor muscles which support the bladder and bowel as well as affects sensualintercourse. Before you start on with this exercise, you have to identify the pubococcygeus muscles. Try this : During micturition, try and stop your urine flow midway by contracting the muscles that help you stop the flow.The muscles which help you hold back urine is the pubococcygeus muscles. Once you identify it, you can exercise by tightening the PC muscles by holding for 5 seconds and then relaxing for 5 seconds. You can do this exercise for at least 2 sets of 10 repetitions every day. Once you master Kegel exercises, you can delay ejaculation beforeorgasm by just contracting the PC muscles during sensualintercourse.It is a great way to enjoysex.
Erectiledysfunction is the inability to maintain an erection duringsex. It is often caused due to high stress, fatigue, performance anxiety, and alcoholism. Brisk walking for up to 2 miles (3.2 Km) or aerobic exercises that can burn around 200 calories are known to facilitate an overall good blood flow to your private parts. The outcome is a harder and longer penile erection. Overall, brisk walking, running, or aerobic activities improves the quality of your sensal life.
Train on yoga. Yoga is a mind-body experience that can bring in excitement and intimacy duringsex. Your partner will love the creative moves and positions along with the buildup of emotional and sensaul energy necessary for a fulfillingsex. According to McCall, yoga postures like the bow posture, peacock posture, and shoulder stand improves pelvic muscles strength during sensualintercourse.
According to McCall, swimming for at least 30 minutes three times a week can increase your sensaul stamina. Studies have also shown that swimmers who are 50+ have a great sensual life because of swimming. Swimming works out all the muscles of the body, especially it builds strong hip flexors and abdominal muscles that help you maintain a pleasurable rhythm in the bed.

Under colonial rule by Spain and France, only Roman Catholics were allowed to own land and practice their faith in what is now Missouri. These rules were relaxed in 1795 and disappeared when the area became United States territory through the Louisiana Purchase in 1804. By 1806 two circuits had been organized to serve 106 Methodists living in the Territory of Missouri. When statehood was granted in 1824, Missouri had a population of 66,000, of which 1,543 were Methodist.
In 1826, Joseph Robidoux, a French fur trapper opened a trading post on the Missouri River at the foot of what is now Jules Street in Indian territory. The six counties comprising Northwest Missouri were added to the state as the Platte Purchase and opened for settlement in 1836, after which a small town grew around the trading post. One of the first families to arrive was Simeon and Jane Anne Kemper and their infant daughter. They came by riverboat from Kentucky by way of Liberty, Missouri in 1839.
She found John Carter and they found three others which became the nucleus of a Methodist class. They began meeting above David Heaton’s cabinet shop at Main and Jules streets in 1843, the year in which St. Joseph was incorporated with a population of about 200. Carter held the position of class leader until it became a society or church in 1844. Two years later, the young church constructed the first brick church in St. Joseph on a corner lot at 3rd and Felix streets, donated by Robidoux, who although a Roman Catholic, recognized the value of churches in every town.
One of the unfortunate schisms in Methodism occurred over slavery in 1844. Churches in slaveholding states became part of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, to which this local church united. Methodists in St. Joseph continued to worship together until 1849, when a local preacher and four other members withdrew and re-organized the Methodist Episcopal Church. That congregation worshipped in several locations until purchasing and refitting a former theatre on Fifth Street, north of Francis. It was known as the Fifth Street or Union Methodist Episcopal Church until adopting the name First Methodist Episcopal Church in the 1890’s. That congregation built a new building on the southeast corner of 8th and Faraon in 1909.
The original church erected a second building on the northwest corner of 7th and Francis streets in 1857. In 1864, it adopted the name “Francis Street Methodist Episcopal Church, South.” In 1906, the congregation erected a new building on the southwest corner of 12th & Francis streets. These congregations were responsible for helping organize and finance new Methodist churches in St. Joseph’s outlying neighborhoods.
The membership in both churches declined with the population and economic profile of the central city, and by 1995, the decision was made that one strong church would make better use of resources instead of two. This resulted in a merger creating the Francis Street First United Methodist Church, utilizing the former Francis Street church facility at 12th and Francis streets.
Over two hundred years, some unfortunate fractures developed over slavery and polity, resulting in new denominations. However, in 1939, three of these bodies merged to form “The Methodist Church.” The “United Methodist Church” was formed by a merger with the Evangelical United Brethren Church in 1968. Today, there are 8 million United Methodists in the United States, making it the second largest protestant denomination behind the Baptists. The Wesleyan movement claims more than 18 million members in various churches worldwide.
The United Methodist Church is considered part of America’s “mainline” Protestantism. Methodists are united by John Wesley’s original 25 articles of faith contained in the Book of Discipline, which provides the denominational structure.

The Black Panther Party for Self-Defense was formed right here in Oakland, California in October, 1966. Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale were the original founders. Later the name of the party was changed to Black Panther Party (BPP).
The party was formed when there was blatant racism prevailing in the United States and most African Americans could not make much progress. The Vietnam war created anti-war sentiments. Many young black men and women went to war against their wishes. All protesters were marked by the local police and Federal Agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The BPP was not spared in these times of hostility. People of color, African Americans in general but especially the members of the BPP were targets and their movements closely watched by Law Enforcement (LE).
In the summer of 1968 the David Brothers established the BBP branch in Brooklyn, New York. A few months later a branch was established in Harlem by Lumumba Shaker. Subsequently, many more branches of the BPP were formed all over the country, mostly in poor African American neighborhoods. The BPP movement began on the West Coast, in Oakland. It moved to the East coast and found fertile ground in Chicago, New York, Harlem, in those locations where there was a concentration of poor African Americans but also African Americans who were waiting to fight for their rights as first class citizens.
BPP members chose to take a stand against those authorities that kept them down. They all were very well versed with self-defense tactics and many of them were fully armed. Law Enforcement (LE) agencies were quick to put down any resistance and many shoot outs took place in those neighborhoods where the BPP had offices and large membership. This was a difficult time for the leaders of the BPP and many of them fled the United States. They took their revolution and the philosophy of the BPP to many a African country, to the Caribbean, and elsewhere.
The main purpose of the BPP was to empower African Americans during a period of time when most African Americans could not make much progress. In many poor neighborhoods many young African Americans were looking for leadership and the BPP filled this void.
Self defense was taught to discipline its members so that some sense of organization could be put in place. Membership was restricted to African Americans and most of the ideology was based on Socialist principles. Armed with the 10 step program the BPP had a clear vision, goals and objectives that endeared many young men and women who became staunch members of the BPP. There was no lack of leadership and even today most everyone agrees that the BPP attained most its goals and objectives with great distinction.
The 10 step program was the Bible of the BPP. It stated that all African Americans should be free and determine their destiny. That there should be full employment and an end to Capitalism that preys on the African American community. It called for decent housing and sound education. It stated that its members be exempt from military service and that all police brutality should stop. It called for the release of all African Americans held in jails and demanded justice by having juries who were African Americans. The BPP demanded land, housing, education, food, clothing, peace and justice. The BPP demanded that they have their own jurisdiction within the U.S. so that they could empower themselves and determine their destiny.
Never before, in recent history had African Americans organized so well , with a determination to attain goals and objectives laid down in the 10 step program.
The BPP based most of its organization and training using standard practices used in the Army. Geronimo ji -Jaga (Pratt) for example was highly trained in the U.S. Army and assumed the role of Minister of Defense for the BPP. Other leaders like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale, Lumumba, had the ability to address the members and hold them spell bound. The BPP realized very early on that in order to keep the organization growing they had to organize the people among whom they lived and worked. Hence huge rallies gathered the masses, mostly in poor neighborhoods and explained to them certain projects linked to education, tenant rights, business operations, self determination, and so on.
Hundreds of BPP leaders were trained, they in turn began teaching and training those who lived in the poor neighborhoods self defense tactics. Free school lunches were provided for needy and poor students. Free clinics where children and adults could get free medical care. Those that needed tutoring were provided with teachers and peers who spent hundreds of man hours helping one another.
It was recognized early on that land rights, home ownership, tenant organization, and taking control of ones destiny were important. The BPP leaders and members clearly understood that their neighborhoods had to project self pride. Towards this end African American neighborhoods were well maintained, kept clean, and the streets well organized. People all over the U.S. watched the BPP and many admired the quick change in those neighborhoods that were once an eye sore to the public. The BPP demanded freedom for all African Americans. The demanded that they rule their destiny and wanted to see progress in all African American communities.
Other minorities followed the progress of the BPP and looked forward to enjoying the rights fought by the BPP leaders and members all over the U.S. The 10 step program stated that the racist government had robbed African Americans bringing them to this country as slaves and treating them as second class citizens. Decades ago the U.S. government had promised all African Americans linked to slavery forty acres of land and two mules. This was made the cry of the day. It was stated that over 50 million African Americans had died from the early days of slavery to the times of the hey day of the BPP. The modest claim of 40 acres and two mules was deemed right. Many statements and comparisons were made linking the issue of the Jews and Hitler during World War II to the U.S. government and the treatment of African Americans.
The BPP demanded full employment and guaranteed income. It held the Federal government responsible to attain this goal and improve the standard of living in all African American communities, most of which were very poor.
The BPP demanded standard housing for all African Americans. It believed that Whites denied decent housing to African Americans. It therefore sought the help of the Federal government and what is more held them accountable to right the wrong.
Education was always a top priority among the BPP leadership and organization. For decades the true history of African Americans and the role they played in the making of the U.S. was not taught in schools and colleges. The BPP demanded that true history and standard education be made available to all African Americans to enable them to participate as equals in society. The BPP was fully aware that education and the position of any African American in society was inter related. The BPP in its various educational program stressed the need to attain educational standards and towards this end trained its leadership to be good educationists.
The BPP left a legacy of good leaders, teachers, business people, and other professional people within the African American population all over the U.S. The Vietnam war played an important role in the philosophy of the BPP. Many young African women and men were called to serve the Armed Forces and did not want to go to war. The prevailing thought of the day was that the African men and women were contributing to the racist White community by fighting and killing people of color. The BPP did not want any of its members and the general African American population to participate in any war that encouraged racism.
On the other hand the BPP made it very clear to the local police and other law enforcement agencies that they would defend the mutual interests of all African Americans and the BPP by any means necessary. This meant if worse came to worse they would defend themselves by using force. This element of force to defend themselves was displayed again and again all over the country. For example on December 8, 1969 the Los Angles Police Department�s newly initiated Special Weapons and Tactics Unit (SWAT) led an assault on the Los Angeles Panther Office Central Avenue. The BPP, some 15 persons held their ground for more than 4 hours surrounded by over 300 police force. The BP Panthers suffered minor wounds and all charges were dropped against the BPP. Similar raids by the LE in Chicago and other parts of the country, rallied all members of the African American community.
Again and again the self defense training provided by the leaders of the BPP proved to hold their ground against the best LE all over the country. The second amendment guarantees all Americans to bear arms. The BPP pointed out to the Constitution as their right to bear arms, so that they could defend themselves. The BPP called upon the police to end police brutality in all black communities. As we have discussed before the BPP always maintained good standard training in self defense and as such members of the BPP could and did always hold their ground.
Thousands of black men and women were held in jails all over the country. Most of these men and women came before juries that were all White and were sent to long jail terms. The BPP demanded that juries be composed of African Americans and that those imprisoned be released because they did not receive a fair and impartial trial.
The BPP demanded that all African Americans have enough land, housing, food, clothing, justice and peace. The BPP demanded that the United Nation hold a plebiscite that should be held throughout the African American colony in which only African American colonial subjects will be allowed to participate. That this plebiscite be held to determine the will of the African American people linked to the National destiny of all African Americans.
The BPP was instrumental in affecting many changes in government and the prevailing political circles of the time. Even today many an African American politicians owe their status in many a political circle because they were influenced by the BPP. Here, in the Bay Area Congressman Ron Delums being one of them. Hundreds of young men and women attended schools and colleges all over the country and today contribute their talents as professional African Americans to the United States and the world.
The BPP was very instrumental is giving women equal rights and permitted them to play an important role at all levels. Many women today owe their success to the efforts of the BPP initiated many years ago. Angela Davis is a well known Black Panther Leader who taught at the University of California at Los Angeles. In 1969 she joined the Communist Party and the following year joined the Black Panther Party. She and other Black Panther Party leaders took a stand for human rights and fought for rights for all people of color. Today, thousands owe thanks for what they stood for and the fruits brought to so many through Affirmative Action.
The Black Panther Party means many things to many people. To most African Americans it was an organization that brought about progress, united the community, and taught African Americans to fight for their rights as United States citizens. Prior to the BPP most African Americans were treated as second class citizens.
Today, the BPP does not function. Most of its leaders were arrested and spent long years in jail. Others, fled the country never to return. Angela Davis spent many years in hiding, came out to face the authorities, and spent years fighting the court system. She won but at great expense. Geronimo Pratt spent 27 years in jail, before being acquitted. Other BPP leaders who fled the country continue to work in other African countries and all around the world.
The Black Panther Party was instrumental in paving the way for many Black Liberation Movements. The BPP helped many people of color, minority groups to unite and stand united in their fight for progress and justice. The BPP brought about a link between African Americans and the African continent. It was during this period that many African Nations were emerging as Independent Nations, casting the shackles of colonialism.
Today, in our quest for freedom and equality, even in the face of such propositions as 209 we remember the Black Panther Party and the 10 step program. The Bay Area has always taken a stand to help people of color, fight injustice and bring about equality. Many of our African American elders witnessed the rise and demise of the BPP, many of our elders and others continue to practice and imbibe the practical lessons leading to progress and self determination.
The BPP took great pride in Self Defense and many minority groups today are following that same path to stabilize their organizations and bring about discipline.

I do Java for a living. Apart from a two-year hiatus back in 2003-05 I’ve been a Java guy ever since I left university in 1997 (Man, sixteen years now! I didn’t realize.).
Java is… well, it’s Java. For all it warts, it’s actually a pretty decent environment to get things done in. Yeah, it’s verbose as hell. Yeah, most projects involve heaps of boilerplate XML. And yeah, Maven is still the best we’ve got. But still, when you know your way around it’s not bad. The 3rd party library support is outstanding, and most of it is Open Source. Performance is generally good. And the cross-platform compatibility is at this point something we just take for granted.
There have been other languages. I was heavily into Common Lisp for a while. I would prefer it over java were it not for the lack of standard libraries. Clojure seemed like a logical progression, but for some reason I couldn’t get into it. I love the premise: “Functional programming with full access to the Java ecosystem,” but for some reason I never stuck around.
I was on the Scala wagon, I know enough Ruby to be dangerous, and I’ve flirted with Go, Haskell, Python, and CoffeeScript. All excellent languages in their own right. None of them really stuck. I’ve read the books, the blogs, the twitters. I know these are the languages the cool kids use nowadays. Maybe it was me, maybe I wasn’t hipster enough.
But there is one language that has grown on me. That hasn’t gone away or been replaced. It’s a ugly little thing, full of warts and cruft that has accumulated over many years. It is a Lisp, but it’s awkward and eccentric even by Lisp standards. It lacks basic necessities like namespaces and, for the longest time, lexical scoping. The standard library is confused and naming conventions are all over the place. Many Common Lisp staples (like loop, map, and reduce) are missing. There is a Common Lisp compatibility package, but using it was controversial and for a long time actively discouraged.
I am, of course, talking about emacs lisp. I took stock of my github projects and realized that apart from the Java stuff, almost all of my recent activities are elisp. This was not something I had planned, it’s just that Emacs is such an awesome elisp IDE. I’m more productive in elisp than in any other environment. When I make code changes I’m not just connecting to a REPL, I’m actually changing the very environment I’m currently coding in. This is incredibly powerful.
So, Java and elisp. Not very cool, I know. But do not underestimate the power of knowing your tools and getting shit done.

- You'll see. Last night, when the cafe closed, that's one o'clock now, I was crossing the street right there, and a beautiful woman leans out the window of her shiny new car and asks,
- Two days before, I was sitting where you're sitting now, and this guy comes over, he's about 27, 28, says,
- I gave him directions, he thanked me and went off. Now today, before coming here, I was at this little cake shop in Silverlake, that's ten miles from here, I go to just about every morning for coffee. And who walks in?
- That's the story. The story so far. The end of the story is this question I want to ask you. I see three possibilities. First, the guy was a detective, showing himself to me to see what I'd do.
- I don't know. Just before I came back to Los Angeles, I was in Tel Aviv, I got an email from a journalist saying she was writing a book about dangerous woman. She'd heard about my wife and wanted to know if I'd help with information, she'd be featured in her book. Fine, I love to talk about my wife. The journalist asks whether I was legally married, did I have marriage documents, was I ever divorced, were the stories I'd written truth or fiction, would I testify in court? I'm suspicious. I ask, Sure you're not a detective? Why the legal questions? Why no questions about confidences exchanged? Words of love? The journalist made a big show of being outraged by my suspicion. I wrote to her Facebook account, seeking confirmation she was writing me from a Gmail account. No answer. I wrote the journalist, asked her how she heard about me. She replied she attended a church in Santa Monica where she met a girl who knows the doctor who married my wife. I knew about this doctor. A couple of years ago I'd visited him at his office, a little down the street from here. I introduced myself to the receptionist, told her my wife was supposed to be working there. She went into another room, returned and said she's been instructed to order me to leave. I asked the journalist,
- Are you planning on knocking on my wife's door, say Hello, I'm Jane. I'm a TV journalist and writing a book about you?
The journalist/detective wrote upon consideration she had to protect her family and would not be pursuing the investigation. The next week, I'd returned to L.A., I got an email from the doctor asking me if I'd talk to his lawyers. He's suing his/my wife for divorce.
- That's one possibility. I don't favor it. Another possibility is that it's simply a coincidence. My old address. The second meeting. Escort business.
- That harmonies have been created in your life, are revealing themselves. Telling you something is going to happen.
- Formal repetitions, suggesting more to follow. My life is taking on a style. A style not created by me but by the world. But this I don't get, this business of the world making itself into art. That's my job.
- Like I said to the woman in the car, I'm happy with my self, my stories, couldn't be happier, it's the practical things...
- I'm used to being the artist. What am I supposed to do while I wait for the world to work its style for me?

The concerted efforts now underway to derail the improved relations between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia established by the Trump administration are unhelpful at best and dangerous to Americas national and economic security at worst.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is a reformer trying to modernize his country. The steps he has taken so far are unprecedented. Letting that progress fall victim to mistakes by his government and attacks from opponents would be a massive mistake.
The death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi  a critic of the Saudi government, who has not been heard from since he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago  was a tragedy. If the facts show the government of Saudi Arabia was responsible for his death it should be held accountable.
But the death of Khashoggi does not outweigh U.S. strategic concerns, which require that we maintain good relations with the Saudi government. We must react accordingly  not as a favor to the Saudis, but in our own national interest.
In the Middle East we must keep our eyes on the biggest threat in the region  the dangerous and virulently anti-American government of Iran, which poses a military danger to its neighbors and our ally Israel.
I also read that Khashoggi was also associated with the Muslim Brotherhood, a terrorist organization who wants to kill us all.

“In the tweet, Poole wrote: “I didn’t realize until yesterday that Jamal Khashoggi was the author of this notorious 1988 Arab News article of him tooling around Afghanistan with Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda co-founder Abdullah Azzam. He’s just a democrat reformer journalist holding a RPG with jihadists.”
Deep down (or maybe just under the skin) these two are anti-Trumpers. I guess Graham has established his “connection” with the ghost of John McLame. I didn’t know being “butt buddies” went beyond the grave, but it would appear that I was wrong.
Khashoggi was no good, and I’m glad he’s dead. But we are not “allies” with the Saudis because of our national interest. We are there solely because of the petrodollar. So we protect a backwards barbaric satanic feudal monarchy that murdered 3000 Americans and is THE leading cause of islamic terrorism around the world. We let them build hundreds of wahabbist mosques in America and bribe our political leaders from Bush, Bush, Clinton, Clinton, Cheney, Obama, etc. The Saudis are one of the most repressive nations on earth, still has slaves, and makes Iran look progressive, makes and Assad look like a wild eyed libertarian.
After all the sophistry, we are merely whoring out our nations honor, and pretending it is for high minded reasons.

Obviously Kashoggi had to disappear for the American-Saudi-Israeli alliance’s sake. Nobody wanted to kill him and make a big mess, so they faked it, and we got the pastor back with plenty of photo ops in the bargain.

Deep State bureaucrats will start leaking 2001 Intelligence reports that implicate Saudi government or Royal Family involvement in the 9-11 terrorist attacks.
The only important question for the MSM - which will be asked 24 hours a day - is “What is Trump going to do about this outrage?”
Nations are just like people. We are lessened and corrupted by every interaction with KSA. It’s a slap in the face to our founding and our founders.
You wouldn’t let your son hang out with an atheist doper homo kid covered in piercings who had been arrested a few times for abusing his grandparents. America is corrupted with this friendship just the way your kid would be.

Still, one doesn’t torture people to death in one’s embassy. Even terrorists. (Well, there have been exceptions.)
Prince should have thrown some scapegoats under the bus by now... Maybe it’s a convoluted anti-Prince plot from SA plotters.
Nuke Saudi Arabia for 9/11 and for Islamic cult, not for Khashoggi. Instead, thank them for one less terrorist in the world. About 1.8 billion to still get rid of.
Khashoggi was a terrorist and I’m not sad he’s gone, but Saudi Arabia is not “reforming” and we don’t need their oil or anything from them. If they want to buy our fighter jets, our guns and other things then fine, but they’d better start doing a better job of actually putting Iran in its place in that case.

The biggest thing that Amazon has to offer in November is intriguing new series, Homecoming. Homecoming comes from Mr. Robot creator Sam Esmail, stars Julia Roberts, and is based on a podcast. That's quite the trifecta of Interesting Things (TM). Other new Amazon original series include the less hyped but equally interesting Mirzapur, Inside Joke, and Patriot Season 2.
Our survey found that membership declines from the April 2018 peak spanned the income scale, although the greatest declines were among consumers in the $35,000–$74,999 income range. This is a demographic that has a near-average Prime penetration rate, meaning that the group does not exhibit the growth potential of lower-income households, which account for a smaller proportion of Prime members. But those in the $35,000–$74,999 income segment also do not have the financial security of those in higher-income households, which account for much higher-than-average subscription rates. So, these data may imply that those in the “squeezed middle” are canceling their Prime memberships at higher rates than those in other income groups, despite an apparently benign economic context.
Amazon also offers its own Elements line of products, only available to Prime members. The product line ranges from baby wipes to vitamins. The idea is that Amazon goes the extra mile of telling you exactly where the product came from. In the case of those wipes, I can tell you liquid inside is 97.9 percent pharmaceutical-grade purified water from the White Lick Creek Aquifer in Moorseville, Indiana.
Watching Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Les Diaboliques through the lens of the modern horror film, especially the slasher flick—replete with un-killable villain (check); ever-looming jump scares (check); and a “final girl” of sorts (check?)—one would not have to squint too hard to see a new genre coming into being. You could even make a case for Clouzot’s canonization in horror, but to take the film on only those terms would miss just how masterfully the iconic French director could wield tension. Nothing about Les Diaboliques dips into the scummy waters of cheap thrills: The tightly wound tale of two women, a fragile wife (Véra Clouzot) and severe mistress (Simone Signoret) to the same abusive man (Paul Meurisse), who conspire to kill him in order to both reel in the money rightfully owed the wife, and to rid the world of another asshole, Diaboliques may not end with a surprise outcome for those of us long inured to every modern thriller’s perfunctory twist, but it’s still a heart-squeezing two hours, a murder mystery executed flawlessly. That Clouzot preceded this film with The Wages of Fear and Le Corbeau seems as surprising as the film’s outcome: By the time he’d gotten to Les Diaboliques, the director’s grasp over pulpy crime stories and hard-nosed drama had become pretty much his brand. That the film ends with a warning to audiences to not give away the ending for others—perhaps Clouzot also helped invent the spoiler alert?—seems to make it clear that even the director knew he had something devilishly special on his hands. —Dom Sinacola
I own about 100 SD cards and I always do a speed test to verify the reading and writing speeds before I install the memory. This card checked out extremely well. The fastest write speed on this card was 73.143 MB/Sec and the fastest reading speed was 93.368 MB/Sec. I have attached the graphical test data for your information. I used a USB 3.0 port with a USB 3.0 card reader for the test.
Elena Ledoux is the founder of MommyGO, a company which makes natural energy products for busy moms that are sold on Amazon. “There is a lot of negative sentiment around Amazon's unfair advantage, which is justified,” says Ledoux, commenting on Amazon’s ability to drive more product reviews for its own stable of brands. “However, everyone forgets about a fair advantage that a product maker can have - to have a superior product. At the end of the day, you can be successful even with fewer reviews if your product is legitimately better.”
Amazon Web Services offers a broad set of global cloud-based products including compute, storage, databases, analytics, networking, mobile, developer tools, management tools, IoT, security and enterprise applications. These services help organizations move faster, lower IT costs, and scale. AWS is trusted by the largest enterprises and the hottest start-ups to power a wide variety of workloads including: web and mobile applications, game development, data processing and warehousing, storage, archive, and many others.
Some commentators have argued that the Amazon website is not equipped to provide a quality experience for browsing, searching and discovering fashion ranges. After all, Amazon established its position by serving as a kind of catalog for products that shoppers buy based mostly on specifications, such as books and electronics—but fashion shoppers tend to browse and buy differently.
We present these figures with the caution that no research firm truly knows how much clothing and footwear is sold on Amazon. We also note that some research firms have enjoyed substantial media coverage on the back of estimates that have placed Amazon as one of the very largest retailers of apparel in the US. We further note the risk of a herding effect, whereby some research firms may be reluctant to estimate figures that vary susbtantially from those published by other firms and that are already in the public domain.
Below, we compare the top five retailers that respondents said they had switched spending to Amazon from with the top five they said they had bought apparel from in the past 12 months. The comparison shows that Target, Macy’s and JCPenney overindex in terms of share of apparel spending lost to Amazon, relative to their overall strength in shopper numbers.
In 2005, Amazon announced the creation of Amazon Prime, a membership service offering free two-day shipping within the contiguous United States on all eligible purchases for a flat annual fee of $79 (equivalent to $99 in 2017),[3] and discounted one-day shipping rates.[4] Amazon launched the program in Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom in 2007; in France (as "Amazon Premium") in 2008, in Italy in 2011, in Canada in 2013,[5] in India in July 2016[6] and in Mexico in March 2017.[7]
Portland filmmaker Matt McCormick begins his very personal documentary with an astounding shot of a nuclear mushroom cloud from high above the Earth, a droning ambient soundtrack roaring to a fever pitch as the explosion takes explicit shape. From there, McCormick narrates the story of his grandfather, one of the U.S.’s select B-52 bomber pilots burdened with flying world-clearing, 4-megaton nuclear weapons on marathon missions over North America, staying ever-ready to drop them on Russia should the Cold War come to a disastrous head. The film’s strength is its wordless, practically impressionistic sense of gravity when pouring over so much found footage and assorted documents from the time, detailing just how much of the world’s destiny was shaped by human beings as susceptible to error—to the failings of the human body—as any one of us. Scored by Portland ambient artist Eluvium (Matthew Cooper), Buzz One Four stays so compelling in its powerfully non-verbal wandering, one wishes McCormick got rid of narration altogether. —Dom Sinacola
The new feature illustrates the growing tension between Amazon and the many big and small brands that have become reliant on the site because of its dominance in e-commerce. Amazon is becoming a direct competitor for more sellers, raising questions around how the company's use of its marketplace sales data could potentially give it an unfair advantage over other brands and merchants.
In a similar vein, Amazon recently started promoting its private-label brands on the pages of competing brands. The complaint some brands made here is that Amazon is getting that advertising space ‘for free.’ But ad space on a highly trafficked site like Amazon is never free. By allocating that space to promote one of its own products, Amazon is by default forfeiting ad dollars from advertisers. Given Amazon’s booming advertising business and how profitable this new division is, Amazon would not be giving up valuable ad space lightly.
In April 2015, Amazon rolled out a new travel site called Amazon Destinations, which focuses on helping customers find "getaway destinations" within driving distance of their homes. Amazon Destinations featured hotel selections in three United States metro areas: L.A., New York and Seattle.[133] Later that year, Amazon discontinued the service.[134]
Human Flow isn’t about its creator, Ai Weiwei, but one of its key moments, occurring about a half an hour before its end, is pure Ai. On their tour of hotspots in our burgeoning global refugee crisis, the director and his crew stop at the U.S./Mexico border to capture footage and talk with locals living on the line of delineation separating the two countries. As the crew films, they are at one point interrupted by the arrival of an American yokel riding a four-wheeler. Whether he’s official or just some self-styled border patrolling vigilante is unclear, though his intent to intimidate the filmmakers is crystalline. Ai Weiwei, having spent the better part of the film’s two-hour running time demonstrating his unfailing grace alongside his bottomless compassion, scarcely reacts. He doesn’t even budge.

The first four parts of this book are absolutely fascinating. It's an in depth look at the psychology of shopping and it is exactly what the title promises. Underhill's company gets paid to spy on people in stores and see what they're doing wrong and right. The gems in this book are the anecdotes and the specific revelations about how any obstacle you put in the way of a shopper drops your sales figures. Any way you can make life easier raises your sales. This all seems sort of obvious, but most people running the businesses don't think it through.
In August 2013, Amazon launched Amazon Art as an online marketplace selling original and limited edition fine art from selected galleries.[73] The initial 40000 items listed for sale included Norman Rockwell's painting Willie Gillis: Package from Home priced at $4.85 million, L'Enfant a la tasse by Claude Monet for $1.45 million and Andy Warhol's Sachiko for $45 000.[74]
Amazon majorly offers two plans in their marketplaces - Prime Photos and Unlimited Storage. The Prime Photos plan offers unlimited storage for photos and RAW files, and a 5 gigabytes of storage for videos and other files, whereas Unlimited Storage plan, intended for non-business customer sections, offers unlimited storage for photos, videos, documents, and files in other formats.[79][80][81]
On April 28, 2015, Amazon announced its launch of Amazon Business.[76] Amazon Business is a service that provides registered business owners with a consolidated platform for buying products and supplies from Amazon. Business users have access to shipping benefits, discounts on eligible products, purchase analytics, and price comparisons from different sellers.
Indeed, Amazon casts a long shadow over a number of industries. Grocery stocks plunged when the company acquired Whole Foods Market last year. Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA) and CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) fell when the company acquired PillPack this summer, and an eventual entry by Amazon into the pharmacy space still hangs over the sector. The 2016 launch of Amazon Prints sent Shutterfly (NASDAQ:SFLY) down 12%.
"Between her curly red hair and my long brown hair, my roommate and I shed a lot. Our tub doesn't have a drain catch and after a particularly effortful session with a plastic drain cleaner, I decided it was finally time to try this viral hair catcher out. This small silicone tool fits into most standard tub drains and collects all the hair before it washes down and clogs your drain. Take it out, remove the hair with a piece of toilet paper, and it's ready for the next shower." — Connie Chen
Prime Pantry: Prime Pantry gives members access to low-priced groceries as well as household and pet care items.

Amazon's rules state that you must be at least 13 years of age to sign up for an account. However, you must be 18 to make a purchase (since you'll need to input this data into your account before a purchase), unless you can obtain enough money in gift card funds to pay for the purchase or receive a gift card-debit card that has a major card company attached that you can input to pay for the entire purchase price.
The company launched amazon.com Auctions, a web auctions service, in March 1999. However, it failed to chip away at the large market share of the industry pioneer, eBay. Later, the company launched a fixed-price marketplace business, zShops, in September 1999, and the now defunct partnership with Sotheby's, called Sothebys.amazon.com, in November.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, A conduit is a person that acts as a channel for the transmission of something. To be open-ended is having no predetermined limit or boundary and Leverage means: Power to influence a person/ a situation and use something to maximum advantage
Yes, you are COOL when you refuse to limit yourself, knowing as a conduit you are not limited in anyway.
You know what I mean, being helpful, lovable but not spiteful. These are essential ingredients of a conduit; they are distinctive skills and characteristics of a conduit, yes, that's when you are really COOL.
Think for a minute, how COOL it is to have money in your pocket, to go shopping and buy some quality clothing or accessories. How COOL to not always go, ' can I have a certain amount of money please.'
How COOL will it be when you know either now or in the future you can make money in an intelligent way?
Yea conduit that's right but you know what? You need to start now don't spend all day watching television or sleeping, sleeping and sleeping. You will shut down as a conduit and you will never be COOL.

A record breaking athlete, philanthropist, business woman, daughter, sister and soon-to-be mother, Serena Williams sets the bar high for what it means to be an empowering role model who has mastered the art of living with confidence and class.
Born in 1981, Serena erupted into the sports scene as an American tennis champion. Since Serena’s first ranking by the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) in 2002 as number one in singles (which she’s since been awarded eight times), her accolades have made her a household name. Holding the most major titles in singles, doubles, mixed-doubles, 23 Grand Slam titles (14 of which were won playing doubles with her sister Venus Williams), four Olympic gold medals and more, it’s no wonder she was named Sportsperson of the year by Sports Illustrated in December 2015.
What inspires us about Serena? In a world where social media stars get the most attention, where women are receiving constant messaging that
the size of our bum is more important than the size of our heart, Serena breaks the current mold. Not into sports? No issue, Serena motivates off-the-court as well and here are our top reasons why:
Honest about hard-work: Not a believer in luck, Serena credits her achievements to countless hours perfecting her craft since the age of four. With a no-short cut approach to success, Serena is honest about the discipline, sweat and tears involved in smashing goals both on and off the tennis court.
Discusses depression: With the unexpected death of one of her five sisters and a series of health complications, Serena is open about her battle with depression. Candid in interviews and memoirs about the difficulty she faced at times just leaving her house, Serena sends a message of acceptance and hope. Crediting regular therapy sessions for helping her heal, Serena serves as a force that supports removing the stigma of discussing mental health.
Shares her success: With career prize-money at 6 million (more than twice the amount of any other female athlete) and an estimated net-worth of $150 million (2016), Serena does her share in supporting others. A UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, Serena started her own initiative called Serena Williams Foundation and opened another charity with her sister Venus, the Williams Sisters Fund. Committed to building schools around the world and offering support to victims of violence, Serena is generous philanthropist.
Fashionably Fierce: Staying true to her authentic self, Serena hasn’t let the world put her in an ‘athlete-only’ box. Taking on the fashion world, Serena has her own line with a goal to create bold and beautiful pieces for women of all shapes and sizes. Not only does
Serena slay runways but she’s also dipped into the realm of acting appearing in movies and television shows. Even Queen Bee aka Beyonce recognizes Serena’s empowering energy and invited her to make a cameo in her 2016 visual album Lemonade to add to its message of strength and courage.
For the reasons above (and so many more), we give a shout-out to Serena Williams for being a woman who inspires hard-work, creativity and compassion.

The Forex world is constantly evolving and during its weekly trading hours there is a wealth of news a trader must keep on top of if they want to make the most money possible. Indeed, because the market can be affected by a number of dynamics, it is essential they know exactly what’s happening at all times in order to avoid any unprofitable deals.
For example, let’s assume the US Dollar is trading well against the Great British Pound during the first half of the week. This would be a good time to invest some money and reap the benefits of a positive market condition. However, by Wednesday a series of negative news stories emerge from the UK and affect the country’s economic performance. These dynamics then adversely affects how well the two currencies are trading. At this point it’s important to know what’s just happened because it will influence whether or not someone should cease trading this currency pair for a while or continue.

Dr. Wendy Hofman sees God’s healing hand at work as she restores sight to people who were blinded by severe cataracts. Dr. Hofman, an ophthalmologist at Bongolo Hospital in Gabon, also is blessed when she sees one of her patients follow the light of the Gospel to saving faith in Jesus Christ.
“At the eye clinic here at Bongolo Hospital, God's free gift of complete forgiveness, through faith in Jesus Christ's substitutionary atonement, is most often shared by national Gabonese pastors in the mornings before clinic begins,” Dr. Hofman said. “But at times, I ask patients about where they are with Jesus, too.”
A man named Eric had to have his left eye removed and his remaining eye needed treatment. When Dr. Hofman asked Eric if he knew Jesus, his face lit up with joy.
“I didn't really know Jesus,” he said. “But since coming here I've discovered that Jesus is not dead. He is not dead! I gave my life to Jesus about two weeks ago for the first time, here at the hospital. Now my wife and child and I pray together every night.”
Medical missionaries help save thousands of lives and lead many to faith in Jesus Christ as they share the Gospel. Through the World Medical Mission Post-Residency Program, Samaritan’s Purse is enabling a new generation of Christian physicians like Dr. Hofman to answer God’s call to serve in the mission field.
The Post-Residency Program has made it possible for 62 Christian physicians and their families to serve in remote mission hospitals in 18 countries. More medical professionals are entering the program every year.
We are so blessed to have Wendy and Eric on our team. And soon, their team is growing! They are returning to the US for a few months for maternity leave!
It's often said that, "you can't judge a book by it's cover". It's often true (I guess that's why they say it!?!), especially in the case of an accident. There's what you can see, and then there are the things that lurk under the surface.
Dale, at MMS Aviation, is leading the charge on take a look "under the hood" of our aircraft- into every corner to find each and every indication of a "discrepancy"- something out of the ordinary. Much of the noticeable damage was "impact" damage- however, in the final moments of our emergency landing, we made impact with a telephone pole and were violently spun ninety degrees to a stop from about 25 mph. The force of that spin and abrupt stop caused forces to travel throughout the aircraft, leading to much of the hidden damage.
Dale is finding some interesting things- even things that weren't associated with our accident and that were not repaired during last years refurbishment. So, MMS will have none of that! They'll be fixing it all. Here's Dale's latest update (23 FEB 2011):
"I have almost finished the hidden damage inspection except for the rudder pedal area, where I know that there are some broken pieces from the accident, but haven't seen in there yet. there is also some nose damage from a previous accident, so we will have to repair that too, it involves pulling a belly skin forward of the doors to gain access, and replacement of some pieces in there. The engine and propeller are off, and the first skins have been removed. The nose gear is also out and I was pleased that it came out quite easily."
We're blessed to have such thorough and professional work on our aircraft. The team at MMS are pros- N207FD is in great hands! Keep up the great work guys!
As you may know, our one and only aircraft has been sitting in one of the hangars belonging to MMS Aviation in Coshocton, Ohio for a few months, waiting until their workload eased and would allow for repairs to begin.
Actually, I should say that, even though THEY couldn't start the work, they delivered the right wing to a wing repair shop in Indiana to have repaired. Here's the photo of how it was delivered back and forth. Th e mechanic making the wing delivery, Paul, was one of the three mechanics that were here, in Gabon, in August to put the wing into the shipping container for delivery to the US. He produced a video regarding his work to deliver the wing and his ministry. See the video HERE.
Today we just received the news that the work is starting, full-tilt, in the hangars of MMS Aviation! Here are the words of Dale C., project leader:
"Today, I am getting the aircraft into position so that we can start work. We are pulling the engine so that we can inspect the engine mounts, and do the repair in the tunnel area.
The fuel pump is going in for overhaul. I have the aileron and flap back, and the wing is also complete. I have a team put together for the gear work and that starts next week."
Please keep Paul and the other technicians in your prayers as they seek to do all the work effectively and in a timely manner.
"The people of Gabon come to Bongolo Hospital looking for hope. When they receive treatment they are prayed for and exposed to the Gospel. As a result over 1000 people have prayed to receive Christ in 2010. They sense light here. Often they come expecting light, even searching for it. I don't know why God chooses Bongolo as a place that pushes back the darkness, but he does in undeniable ways. There were many little moments in 2010 where God used me to touch hearts for his kingdom, despite myself. My greatest desire in 2011 is to see him continue to do this to an ever-increasing degree. My desire is that I would not let the many distractions of living in community with my fellow international workers and life's many entanglements, especially what I allow my mind to dwell on, take me from those opportunities that can easily be lost in the busyness.
Here's one of those opportunities that was not lost: I remember Fleurette ("little flower"), a woman in her mid 20's, a mother of two little boys that came to our hospital and was admitted with AIDS and TB. I saw her walking into her room one morning, her clothes barely hanging onto her emaciated body. I knocked on Little Flower's bedroom door, not because I am particularly godly or even wanted to, but as so often happens to me, because of the Holy Spirit prompting me to. I asked her about her life and I remember imagining how beautiful she used to be as she beamed talking about her two boys. A local witchdoctor had lied to Fleurette about the cause of her illness and thus she'd wasted precious months in the witch doctor's "care" before coming to Bongolo.
At Bongolo Hospital, Little Flower received the truth that she was actually suffering from AIDS and was in need of anti-retrovirals. I explained who I was and a bit of my testimony of how I came to work at Bongolo. I asked her what she knew about Jesus. She said, "I cannot lie. I've walked into churches before but I don't understand what they are saying." I explained God's plan of salvation for mankind to save us through Jesus. It was apparent that God had prepared her heart. This time, she understood. I asked her if she wanted to accept God's forgiveness and become his child. She said "yes" with great confidence and prayed to receive Christ.
A day or two later I saw her parents carrying her near lifeless body into a bush taxi to bring her home to die. An infection had invaded her skin and lungs, and as is common in rural Gabonese culture, the family had decided that it was the moment to take her home. When I realized what was happening, I ran to her, leaned into the taxi, and looked into her eyes. She was still hanging on to consciousness. I assured her that Jesus was waiting to welcome her. Fleurette did not at all appear afraid . She acknowledged me with as much of a nod as she could muster.
I remember being somewhat taken aback by the peace I found in her face, even though I've seen it over and over watching believers in Christ in their final moments of life. Only thirty minutes later, she arrived in her village. I imagine Fleurette thought to herself, "Why keep Jesus waiting any longer?." Her family later told me that she was dead upon arrival."
You never know what may happen on any given day, here on the equator. One day I'm looking for a plunger to do... well, you know what you do with a plunger, then the very next day you get a call and you're sitting down with, well... you never know who!
On this particular day, I received a phone call at 10am and, had a 3pm meeting at the Aero Club at the Libreville Int'l aiport with this gentleman...
J. Peter Pham is Senior Vice President of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy in New York City. He also holds academic appointments as Associate Professor of Justice Studies, Political Science, and African Studies at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia, and non-resident Senior Fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies in Washington, D.C. He currently serves as Vice President of the Association for the Study of the Middle East and Africa (ASMEA) and Editor-in-Chief of its refereed Journal of the Middle East and Africa.
Dr. Pham has authored, edited, or translated over a dozen books and is the author of over three hundred essays and reviews on a wide variety of subjects in scholarly and opinion journals on both sides of the Atlantic. In addition to the study of terrorism and political violence, his research interests lie at the intersection of international relations, international law, political theory, and ethics, with particular concentrations on the implications for United States foreign policy and African states as well as religion and global politics.
Dr. Pham has testified before the U.S. Congress on numerous occasions and conducted briefings or consulted for the U.S. and foreign governments as well as private firms. He has appeared in various media outlets, including CBS, PBS, CBC, SABC, VOA, CNN, the Fox News Channel, MSNBC, National Public Radio, the BBC, Radio France Internationale, the Associated Press, Reuters, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Washington Times, USA Today, Le Monde, National Journal, Newsweek, The Weekly Standard, New Statesman, and Maclean's, among others.
So, you never know! I had a great time getting to know Peter and sharing a little about our work here. He's in town to meet with some VIP's in the Gabonese gov't and was gracious to find time to meeting with a fellow American for a coke. Not only that, but he insisted on picking up the tab!
As a pilot in Gabon, you must have an annual pilot evaluation for each different Gabonese-registered aircraft you would like to fly. In the US, we'd call this a "type rating". The challenge is that there are no pilots here that are certified to give these evaluation flights, so you have two choices- either have that pilot flown in or go and find the pilot.
Since the aircraft that we normally use (CESSNA 207) is a US registered aircraft, we are happy to not have to do this. However, since our aircraft is down for repairs, we're using a backup aircraft (BEECHCRAFT Baron) that IS Gabonese registered. So...
Our check pilot, Tony S., is a South African pilot of acclaim. He has flown all over the world and the list of aircraft that he is certified to check out pilots in is quite long and includes WWII vintage aircraft up to business jets that cruise along at MACH 0.8- pretty impressive. He has also flown for the CIA during some times of turmoil in places like Angola and also flew for the Rhodesian Air Force (can't find Rhodesia on a map? Check wikipedia).
Hunting Tony down is difficult. The last time we met for a check ride, he happened to be in Libreville and had a free morning for a flight with me a lunch (read about it here). This time, however, he wasn't due to be in Gabon for a few more months, and we ready for our validation flights now. So, it was off to South Africa to find him.
Getting off the red-eye flight early in the morning in Johannesburg, you can still see evidence that the country has recently hosted the World Cup soccer tournament. Posters are everywhere. My traveling companion, Egmont, and I headed through the immigration formalities, picked up our bags, and headed to pickup our rental car. The airport was in stellar condition and so clean. All the spoken and written language were in English! I was feeling very much at home, until... we started driving on the wrong side of the road! Let me tell you, this takes a long time to get used to. Driving down the road, we saw sights that made us wonder, "are we really in Africa?" The infrastructure, the advertising, modern buildings, and cleanliness... we were in a "first world" country, for sure.
Prior to boarding our overnight flight to SA, Egmont informed me that we would be taking our flight check the very day that we arrived! I would have preferred a day to get my feet under me, but Egmont said it was better this way. I didn't question the veteran! So, without delay, we made our way from Joburg (short for Johannesburg) to Randburg, where we checked into a bed and breakfast. Our room wasn't quite ready for us, so we headed down the road to do a little shopping- again, I was amazed at the shopping centers... very American in style. Back at the B&B, I got a shower to get a little revived, and then it was off to the airport in Lanceria for the check ride.
Upon arrival, we couldn't help ourselves and made our way to the pilot shop to check out all the goodies. If you are a person with a particular hobby and you find yourself in a shop that caters to that particular hobby, you know what kind of experience this can be. Basically, if money was no obstacle, you'd want one of everything! I came away unscathed (mainly because I had no money!) and Egmont was able to make some purchases for the company.
We made our way to Gryphon Flight Academy and met our instructor, Anton (with me in the photo). We had some time getting to know one another, discuss some theory on the aircraft, and then jumped in his nice Mercedes to drive to the parking area where the Beechcraft Baron was at.
Egmont was first, and I watched from the back. Then, we switched places and I had my evaluation flight. Both of us did pretty much identical things; touch and go's, single engine operations, steep turns, stalls, etc. We touched back down at Lanceria; both Egmont and I had successfully demonstrated mastery of the aircraft!
So, we had been in Joburg for less than 24 hours and had accomplished our task- getting our evaluation flight successfully accomplished! ...well... almost everything. As with most every job, it's not over 'til the paperwork is done! This would prove challenging.
If you've been paying attention, you remember that the name of our check pilot referenced at the beginning of this post was "Tony", however, we flew with "Anton". Explanation? Sure... Well, Tony was busy doing a seminar and had his colleague, Anton, take care of our flight. Based on Anton's evaluation, Tony would endorse our logbook and fill out the paperwork for us. So, that was the step we now embarked on- finding Tony.
Using a GPS app on Egmont's iPhone 4, we arrived at Solenta Aviation- site of Tony's seminar. After a short wait in the lobby, Tony exited the meeting room and, 10 minutes later, we were out the door with all paperwork signed!
So, now, just a day and a half after arriving in Joburg, we had accomplished our task! Now what!?! A bit of discovery is in order.
Egmont and I ended up touring all the large shopping malls in the area- every floor or every mall! It was excellent exercise as well as a lot of fun to check out the latest and greatest stuff that nobody really needs.
For dinner, it was a tour of the world. Stop off's on the tour included Greece (lamb), Germany (Schnitzel), India (curry), Thailand (pad thai), and basic european! Good eats, I must say. Joburg restaurants are impressive.
Other events included going to one of the areas most famed raceway, Kyalami, and watching high-speed motorcycles speed around the track. Inside the large raceway, was another track for karts where a two hour race was underway. These folks are very serious.
All in all, Joburg is a pretty incredible place. My first visit made me really want to return... this time with the whole family!
When you live abroad, you don't mind "big brother" so much. In fact, expats tend to look out for one another and people that may not be friends in another setting find themselves at each others' homes and getting together for parties and more. Embassy workers make up a big part of that. There's a sense in which we all are bonded by having a deeper understanding of the "peculiarities" of life in our current setting- it's unspoken. Sometimes you can just see it in each others' eyes.
So, from time to time, the US Embassy issues an email that goes out to the expats here, reminding them of an upcoming event or warning of a situation that they think we need to know about. I have been asked to be the "Warden" for the "faith" community of US citizens serving in Gabon, so I receive these emails and make sure that my "posse" (that's how we say it in the biz) has the "4-1-1" (or "info"... again... vernacular in the biz). No... I do not wear a badge.
The latest email from the Embassy was a warning about thefts. Having been robbed a couple of times, one of them being a mugging, I say to my fellow US citizens living in Gabon- TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY!!!
Warden Message U.S. Embassy Libreville, Gabon Security Notice - Increase in Crime February 4, 2011 This Warden Message alerts U.S. citizens to the increase in crime throughout Gabon during the past several weeks. Criminals prey upon those they perceive to be affluent, including U.S. citizens. Remain vigilant, stay current with media coverage of local events, and be aware of your surroundings at all times. In light of the increase in burglaries, we remind you to take all security measures such as using locks and setting alarms, limiting access to your residence to trusted individuals, and locking up valuables out of sight. To prevent carjacking and petty theft, you should travel with your car windows up, doors locked, and items of value hidden from view. You should avoid marginal neighborhoods, poorly lit streets, and unfamiliar areas of the city, especially at night. You should not walk, run, or stay on the beach alone or in groups after dusk. When dining in restaurants or visiting markets, you should carry only minimal amounts of cash and avoid wearing excessive amounts of jewelry. If involved in an attempted robbery or carjacking, you are encouraged to comply with the attacker to avoid injury and to report all incidents to the police and the U.S. Embassy. Demonstrations can occur in Gabon with little warning. We remind U.S. citizens that even demonstrations intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and possibly escalate into violence. U.S. citizens are urged to avoid the areas of demonstrations if possible, and to exercise caution if within the vicinity of any demonstrations.
And the email continues with contact info and about how you should tell people where you're going and keep in touch. All good stuff. My suggestion??? Come and hang out with Alace, Sam and I and our scary looking (but really sweet) HUGE dog, "Tozer".
In 2007, I quit my commercial pilot job in the US, packed up the family, and we moved to the equator in central Africa to start the first ever dedicated medical air transport program for the region.
The Alliance national church in Gabon has broken ground on the PK 27 project that will be home to many social care programs run by our Gabonese colleagues. It will also feature a landing airstrip and hangar. Now, along with the US-based facilitator of the project, E4 Project, we are brainstorming what kind of educational opportunities might flow out of the aviation program to equip nationals. We invite you on this journey! Here is more info, via video...
If you are having issues loading the video below, please go to this website: https://vimeo.com/169423859
Year after year, dedicated supporters of medical missions at Bongolo Hospital make and collect items to be sent, via shipping container, to Gabon. I have actually been in Gabon, when these containers are being processed at the port, unloaded, and put into use. Be rest assured that ALL ITEMS are used to bless those that come seeking health and hope in a very remote part of Africa. Our Gabon team of international workers are so blessed to have this teamwork.
Thank you for considering joining in the provision of the current needs at Bongolo. The next shipment will depart Cleveland, Ohio (ARK Transport), September 1st, so it's a good idea to get the word out now. Details are below.
3. LABEL EACH BOX!!! Please label each box by letter and numbers, for example, if your church is in Plain View, Iowa and you’re sending 2 boxes, you might choose PVIO#1, PVIO#2. Please include the two letter state abbreviation in your label as there are a lot of churches with similar names.
WHERE TO SEND: Send the boxes to : ARK Transportation c/o Gabon Shipment Bongolo Hospital, 17830 Englewood Drive, Middleburg Heights, OH 44130 by September 1st, 2016
*NOTE: We are currently looking for individuals or churches that would be willing to be a collection point and then be responsible for transport to ARK Transport, located near Cleveland, OH. If you are so very kind as to do this, please contact Coleen Lofgren or myself (gabon.pilot@gmail.com).
Finished sizes needed are: 12” x 12”, 24” x 24”, 36” x 36”. 48” x 48”. You can make them out of gently used cotton and cotton/polyester material, sheets or old tablecloths (don’t use flannel- it is too loose a weave). Preferred colors are blue, green or white solid (others accepted though). To make them, cut the material 1/2” larger than the size wanted. They are to be double thickness, with the seams on the inside. After sewing the two pieces of material, turn it inside right, then sew a seam about 1/2” around the entire square and then an “X” from corner to corner. this way, when they are washed, they will stay in place. Questions? Call Coleen at 218-245-2706.
Use flat sheets twin or full size, any color, out of cotton or cotton/polyester. Fold sheet in half so it is 48” x 66” (twin) or 48”x 81” (full). Sew or Zig-zag around the entire doubled sheet, including the folded side, close to the edge. Then measure half way down (33” or 40.1”) and sew across the sheet.
On June 19th, the Alliance church of Gabon had the ground breaking ceremony of the PK27 Project just outside the capital city of Libreville! This property will be the home of a social works campus that will include a hospital, children's home, widow's home, career training, primary and secondary education, airport and hangar facilities. More than half the population of Gabon lives within 40 kilometers of this campus! A huge industrial complex is in development stages only 2 kilometers away.
For those of you who have followed our journey, you will recall some early stories about this God-sized project in 2012 and 2013. It seemed that it was WAY TOO BIG of a dream, but, we have seen some really awesome things on this journey.
This project is being led and executed by the Alliance national church in Gabon. Half the finances will come from the churches in Gabon and the other half from partnerships. If you are interested in getting behind this effort, I will be posting the information sometime soon. For more information, please visit the webpage of the partnership coordinator, E4 Project: CLICK HERE
These pictures come thanks to partners organized by E4 Project. If you or your group are interested in partnerships or a vision trip to Gabon, please contact me (gabon.pilot@gmail.com) or E4 Project (info@e4project.org).
> Praise the Lord for a unanimous decision of the delegates to the Gabon C&MA national council meetings to re-elect the entire national leadership last week. Since our partnership in Gabon is driven by and with these leaders, it's nice when we have the same people in place. More than that, however, this team of leaders in Gabon are Godly men and women that we really enjoy working with and being friends with.
> Please pray for the inter-church committee in GABON working to advance Bible translation in the nation. They are making partnership decisions and setting plans. Our aircraft has served these efforts already and are looking forward to more of this Kingdom-building work!
> Please pray for the national Gabonese church's "PK-27" project. A social works campus with a landing strip for our aircraft! They just had their cornerstone laying ceremony!

Why do you assume I''m human? I wasn''t born. I was created just like this. First I was an idea. Then I came into being, charged with a very important task. I''ve come to find..
Red Rocks is the mecca of music venues. This amphitheater near Morrison, CO is often ranked as the best setting in the world to take in a show alongside places like The Gorge, Hollywood Bowl, The Greek, Slane Castle, and Royal Albert Hall among others. The list of acts that have performed on the hallowed Red Rocks stage reads like a Who’s Who of music history: The Beatles, U2, The Grateful Dead and Jimi Hendrix just to name a few.
In 2013, some performers from our little music scene were invited to join the talented roster of acts to take the Red Rocks stage. I was unable to make it the inaugural concert that featured Randy Rogers Band, Wade Bowen, Stoney LaRue and Casey Donahew. So, as soon as plans were announced for a 2014 version of the show, my plans were set in motion. I had to be there. And I was.
What began with a 4AM alarm and hurried trip to DFW airport would end in a remote cabin in Evergreen, CO.
Red Rocks is majestic and magical. You could really run out of adjectives to describe it. What Wrigley is to baseball, Pebble Beach to golf, Madison Square Garden to basketball…that’s what Red Rocks is to music. It is the venue. It’s nestled outside of Denver in the mountainside. It’s literally carved from the earth. There is no bad sightline and the vistas are breathtaking. The sound can be spotty depending on which way and how hard the wind is blowing, but overall there are moments that a PA isn’t even required.
Getting to the venue can be an adventure if you don’t know what you’re doing. Twisting, winding mountain roads lead to seemingly nowhere until you see Red Rocks beckoning on the hillside. In a sea of green mountainsides, it’s broad red tops jut out and invite you to come see what the fuss is about. We parked on the south side and this led to quite a hike to enter the show. It appeared that folks who parked on the opposite side had a less stringent walk, but that could be wrong.
Everything about the place is grand and special, including the $8 beer prices. When I ordered a “Coors Original”, I was immediately outed as a Texan by the beer vendor. He explained that locals call it “Currrs”, which resembled the way I’d heard some rednecks at the dirt track growing up refer to the Golden brand. Our gracious local hosts, Courtney and Rob, assured me that the beer vendor was crazy.
The weather had been troubling all day long. Rainy and chilly. The sun wasn’t coming out to play and each passing hour, it seemed to get a little more windy and miserable. As we were entering the venue, the sound system was blaring CCR’s “Who’ll Stop the Rain”. Fitting. And, I assume the good Lord was listening because it cleared off about 20 minutes before showtime.
We settled on some seats about 25 rows back and close to the center and soundboard. We could see the Denver skyline in the distance and had a great view of the stage as well. I scoped out the merch stand, bathroom situation and vetted our concert neighbors. The last part had me troubled when Kyle Park strode out to start the show acoustic and my neighbor asked me: is that was Randy Rogers? And why is Randy Rogers opening the show? Isn’t he the headliner? After I explained that was Mr. Park on the stage, we settled in for music.
Park asserted himself onstage with just his guitar and lead player. Red Rocks is an intimidating venue with a full-band show. Let alone an acoustic set that will accentuate all your flaws or mistakes. He breezed through his catalog of regional hits and made some good banter with the audience. He drew an especially hearty response when he called out the great number of young women dressed like this concert was taking place on the beach instead of the side of a mountain in the rain. “Some of you girls are wearing nothing…not that I’m complaining, but there’s a weather channel app y’all…I have it on my phone…it’ s free…you might want to check it out.”
Turnpike Troubadours took the stage next to the sounds of Shinyribs “Take Me Lake Charles” and rightfully had all the confident swagger of the hottest band on the circuit. Evan Felker’s voice sounded a tad strained, but this was a band in control and at their peak. The crowd grew rowdy and raucous during their set…but always respectful. They bobbed along and sloshed beer on one another without being ornery. It was all in the name of a good time. Turnpike played hit after hit after hit. They held the throttle down throughout the set and played everything you’d want to hear. The sun came out full blast during their set and the whole mood within Red Rocks lifted with it.
After relatively quick set change due to all rigs and drums being on rolling risers, Casey Donahew arrived on stage next. It is no secret that we at this website are no fans of his music. I think it’s trite, simplified, pandering and full of inauthenticity. However, his band is good and they do put on what could be termed as a good show. It was my first time to sit through a Donahew set in a number of years. The whole thing was boisterous and raucous. The choreographed moves and canned speeches that he probably gives at each show were not lost on this Colorado crowd. Despite being one of the few native Texans in attendance, you’d have been fooled by that fact based on the crowd response to “Stockyards is My Backyard”. Fort Worth’s population grew immensely during that song. Weird. I just don’t think I could ever scream along and pump my fist to a song about another state. About 2/3 of the crowd, which was nearly capacity by this point, really seemed to dig Donahew’s whole deal and I was part of the third that did not. But that’s okay, I’m not his target demo.
Another set change followed and some spectacular stage lighting was unveiled. By now, the sun had set and the scene was set for a special set from the Randy Rogers Band. The RRB boys began with “Fuzzy” and then followed with a string of songs that were a bit more old school. It was super cool to hear them tearing through songs I’ve heard so many times in other settings in such a unique environment. The crowd was screaming along and dancing in the wide aisles with every note. At one point, Randy made the comment “I grew up listening to my dad’s record collection…Willie, Glen Campbell, The Beatles…The Stones…I’m pretty sure my dad’s record collection is why we’re at Red Rocks tonight.” That wide range of influences has always been at the root of RRB’s sound and success. No other band is able to as nimbly mix country and rock’s best elements into a sound all their own. This skill was certainly on display at Red Rocks on this Memorial Day Eve.
Toward the end of the RRB set, things just turned surreal. I began to feel like I was having an out of body experience. The hectic travel day, altitutde and music were combining to make me feel like I was dreaming. A few hours earlier I’d been sitting in drought ravaged central Texas. Now I was on the side of a mountain in a breathtaking venue listening to one of my favorite bands. Life is crazy like that sometimes. Once we dodged the bears and foxes on the mountain roads back to our friend’s cabin, things began to set in. I’d just kicked something off the ol’ bucket list. The silence in front of me juxtaposed perfectly with the music I’d been enjoying for the previous few hours.
12 hours later I was back in Texas and back to reality. The whirlwind of a 24 hours still ringing in my ears. Red Rocks lived up to my expectations and exceeded them. If you’re a music fan, I can’t encourage you enough to get to a show at Red Rocks. It’s truly special. I’m already looking forward to my next Red Rocks whirlwind.
You nailed it ! We were there Tuesdaynight , and although it was Aug.8 – it was chilly and wet . Not enough adjectives as you say — and glad to know I wasn’t wrong about the wind having some effect on sound . “If you’re a music fan …” EXACTLY .

The festival was established in 2002. A statement about the festival reads, "Festival founder Wayne Lee was looking for a way to showcase high-quality films appropriate for the entire family, so he started planning a film festival in 2000. He met a team of talented professionals, and together they started the Salt Lake City Film Festival which debuted in August 2001. Filmmakers competed for the Gloria Award, a golden a. Audiences were amazed at the high-quality films they found at the first-year festival.
In 2002, the festival moved to West Valley City, Utah. With the move the organizers decided to change the name of the festival. They decided Gloria was a great name for the event. Not only is Gloria the name of the founder's mother, but it is a word that invokes people to aspire to higher goals. We have found that so many filmmakers aspire to higher ideals and look forward to showcasing your films many years into the future.
Our 2006 festival was held in downtown Salt Lake City for 10 days. The documentaries and short films about social issues were the most popular films with our audiences this year. We will be returning to West Valley City for our 2007 festival, and the community is excited about providing us with a large amount of support."
The mission statement of the festival reads, "The Gloria Film Festival showcases films that stir the soul, heal the heart, and enrich the world."

Lazy Games releases public early access demo for “Overdosed: A trip to Hell,” A panicked battle for your sanity coming to PC in 2015
When you’re surrounded on all sides by nightmarish giant spiders, killer sentient furniture, and other terrifying entities hell-bent on ripping you apart, you don’t have much time to think But while you’re unloading hundreds of Uzi rounds, shotgun shells and flame-thrower bursts into the hopelessly large swarm of oncoming monsters, you might find yourself with enough time for the occasional stray thought. Thoughts like, “Would now be a good time to use my last mine?” or “I hope I remembered to turn the stove off…” or perhaps even, “I wonder if taking that entire bag of experimental LSD has anything to do with this terrible headache.”
Overdosed: A Trip to Hell, is an arcade style top-down twin stick shooter where you’re desperately trying to beat back a tide of nightmarish hallucinations with a full arsenal of weapons. Our aim is to recapture the essence of old school arcade gameplay, not by trying to force nostalgia by mimicking the pixel graphics of the time, but by focusing on what truly made those games fun while adding a few modern touches. Like any retro arcade game worth it’s salt, Overdosed is quick and easy to get started with, challenging to beat and most of the focus is on building up player skill rather than grinding out character stats.
The demo contains one stage of the game’s survival arena mode, one playable character, a few enemy types to fight and a wide variety of available weapons. The upcoming version will have a “rougelike” style mode in addition to the arena mode, where you have to explore unknown areas while struggling to survive. There will be more level themes with their own enemy variety, including a haunted mansion, as well as customizable characters. You can find out more about Overdosed: A Trip to Hell, and check out development updates on Lazy Games’s website here: http://www.lazygames.org/ , As well as our indie DB page: http://www.indiedb.com/games/overdosed

Havdalah is the Hebrew word for “separation.” In Judaism, Havdalah is a religious ceremony marking the end of the Sabbath. Here at Gateway, we observe Havdalah with an Equip class on Saturdays at the Southlake Campus.
You can expect a brief Havdalah liturgy followed by a biblical teaching. We end with a fellowship time. As the Sabbath ends, Havdalah prepares us to engage the world for the Lord.
Come learn the steps to the worship dances we participate in at our Shabbat Service. Children are also encouraged to attend but must be accompanied by an adult. Registration is not required.
There is nothing quite like the experience of walking in a lush forest, of being surrounded by a rich array of green and flowers, of ancient redwoods and fecund red soil wherever your eyes can see. I don’t know about you, but I don’t get the opportunity often enough to spend time taking in the nourishing presence of a forest, which is why I always appreciate a written passage that takes me into the experience…..
“As I headed farther into the forest, I could no longer hear the sounds of the cars or smell their fumes. I breathed in the pure wonderful air. It tasted sweet on my tongue. Everywhere I turned, there was life whether I could see, smell, hear, taste, or touch it or not. For the first time, I really felt what it was like to be alive, to feel the connection of all life and its inherent truth – not the truth that is taught to us by so-called scientists or politicians or other human beings, but the truth that exists within Creation.
The energy hit me in a wave. Gripped by the spirit of the forest, I dropped to my knees and began to sob. I sank my fingers into the layer of duff, which smelled so sweet and so rich and so full of life, then lay my face down and breathed it in. Surrounded by these huge ancient giants, I felt the film covering my senses from the imbalance of our fast-paced, technologically dependent society melt away. I could feel my whole being bursting forth into new life in this majestic cathedral. I sat and cried for a long time. Finally, the tears turned into joy and the joy turned to mirth, and I sat and laughed at the beauty of it all.”
I am just now realizing that I have chosen this forest theme today out of a deep yearning, because I simply MUST head up the coast within the next week or so for some solitary, enriching time in the forest groves and streams that fill the Big Sur coastline. I’ve been so busy of late with a convergence of serving many clients’ needs mixed with the launch of the new Sacred Life Leadership program. I need to give myself the restorative gift of surrendering to the exquisite nourishment that the land always provides…….
May you be blessed in opening to your own receiving and nourishment as you traverse your very full life,
We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: Be reconciled to God. 2 Corinthians 5:20
The Bible tells us that, “We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us.” Quite honestly, sometimes I can’t believe that God trusts His image with people. People are crazy! I mean, does He see what people are saying on His behalf on street signs and social media? Of course He does. That was an obvious and rhetorical question. A question prompted by the repeated observation of Christians trying to make a valid point in an invalid way. I am guilty of this too. However, I am learning that the way we say things is just as important as what we say.
The way we present ourselves and the way we talk about God is crucial. The fate of people hang in the balance. The way we speak truth is either repelling or alluring. It is rarely, if ever, neutral. Not only is it important to know what we believe, but it is important to learn how to communicate our beliefs with grace and wisdom. When it comes to hot-button issues in our culture, we are to be wise in how we have conversations and communicate God’s truth. “Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone” Colossians 4:5-6.
Full of grace and seasoned with salt. We do not have to be an expert in theology or even skilled in conversation to be full of grace. What does it mean to “season with salt”? To answer this we need to consider how salt was used in biblical times. It was not your modern-day, refined table salt. Salt was used to preserve the life of fresh fish and vegetables so they wouldn’t spoil. It was also used for healing as unrefined salt has beneficial trace minerals. Seasoning a conversation with salt means that we are to be an instrument of life and healing. I don’t think we can do this by having a heated “conversation” over social media. We need to have difficult, grace-filled conversations face to face and eye to eye and always in the context of a relationship.
Taking stands on issues is not more important than the people living them. Our only goal should be to help people know Christ. Instead of using the Bible to destroy or prove a point, use it as a basis of conversation within the framework of a relationship. Learn to ask good questions of those who live differently than you (open-ended ones are best). Be willing to listen more than you speak. Understand that you can learn something even if you vehemently disagree with someone.
Good conversations build and strengthen people, they never destroy. Our words should affirm the truth about God but also the value of the people He created. One of my favorite things about God is that He has not dumped the entire box of His Truth on my lap at once. He has revealed Himself, little by little, in the context of our relationship. He has loved me through my dumb choices and outright disobedience. He even died for me while I was still a sinner. Truly believing this truth will change the way we speak to and love others.
This is my Prayer: Father God, thank you for sending your son to die for me while I was still a sinner. Lord thank you for loving me, a sinner, now. Jesus please give me wisdom when I speak to others about You. Help me to pause before I speak and ask for Your help. I want to be better at conversations because I want people to know You better. In your name Jesus. Amen.

You have 10 Days in Asia - touring by train, airplane, ship, or on foot. Chart your course from start to finish using destination and transportation tiles. With a little luck and clever planning, you just might outmaneuver your fellow travelers.
The two videos on this page are on 10 Days in Americas - all the games in the 10 Days series are played more or less the same way - but just with a different map. There are five in the 10 Days series and they are 10 Days in USA, Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas.
BGG Neil Thomson in Review:"10 Days in Asia - A Detailed Review" - compares all the five games in the 10 Days series.
BGG Tom Vasel in Review:"10 Days in Asia / 40 Days around the World" Read about how Tom Vasel combined 4 of the 10 Days series games into one big game.
BGG Geoff Macknish:"Another of the short, easy-to-play, fun-to-play-even-if-you-lose games in the "Ten days" series. Oceans and trains produce quite a different balance from say "10 Days in Africa" or "10 Days in the USA". Simple to learn. Finding all those ex-USSR states takes a little while. The "10 Days" series are great for teaching geography. Thoroughly recommended"
BGG Alvin C:"Quick and fast game, great for learning geography. Usually play multiple games in a row!"
BGG Pete McNamara:"This is a fun short game and good to play with our 8 year old. He also likes to play. The map and concept are great for learning geography and there is enough game to make it interesting. "
BGG Christopher Mendes:"Very basic strategic game. Good for all ages and helps with geography. One of my favourite light games.	"
10 Days in Asia is the fourth in a series of games that essentially offer the same game play. How they differ is in the geography of the region used in each game and then further small tweaks are present in the movement mechanics.
The end goal however is the same for the entire series - Each player is attempting to be the first to create a 10 Day Travel Itinerary to travel around the region (in this case the Asian Continent). The only restriction is the Itinerary must be correct according to a set of movement rules.
Combine the asking price with the re-playability of the game and any game in the series is going to provide good value for money. So yet again Out of the Box have managed to take their 10 Days concept and create a new experience that is different and still compelling.
BGG Peter Elsenheimer:"This is my favorite of the series. Fun. Simplistic, yet strategic. Educational, and kids still enjoy this game. A good time for gamers and lesser mortals alike. The games don't take forever. Someone said that this is Rack-O with geography, but it is much better than that."
BGG Damon Williams:"I like the addition of the railroads. I also enjoy that this version has railroads, planes, and boats, in addition to being able to walk to adjacent countries. I find it makes the game more enjoyable, and gives for a lot more options when trying to finish out routes."
BGG Rick Keuler:"Probably the hardest of the 10 Days bunch. The longitudinal nature of Asia makes for an interesting and slightly more difficult trip creation process. I enjoyed it a lot and look forward to playing it some more!"
Out of the Box Publishing creates innovative party, card and board games that provide fresh, fun and engaging ways to enjoy time with friends and family. Games that:
From party to strategy games, they produce a gamut of games to please virtually any game enthusiast. Because these games are carefully designed and crafted, you can be confident that your game playing experience will always be enjoyable – right out of the box!

Jeremy_Felder July 11, 2017	Perspectives on Globalization Comments Off on My Life Within Globalization 227 Views
There are many facets to globalization but the one that affects our daily lives the most is the internet and social media. According to the Global Web Index, about fifty percent of the world population has access to the internet. Of that fifty percent, thirty seven percent have active social media accounts. This is probably the most impactful way globalization has affected me. I am constantly using Facebook and WhatsApp to keep in touch with friends from other countries or friends that are visiting other countries and use the internet to read world news that might affect me or my investments.
Globalization has allowed people to immigrate quicker and for less money. I have immediate and extended family that live outside of the United States and more of my immediate family would like to move as well. Globalization has allowed my family to visit each other more often than ever before and to keep in touch better. Globalization has made companies change the way they operate especially if they want to be a part of the larger economy. This has allowed my father to retain his job here in the United States while living abroad.
Globalization has helped the United States in some ways and hurt the US in other ways. One way that the United States has benefited is their capability to sell arms to other nations. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, currently the US accounts for thirty three percent of world exported arms. This brings lots of money to the US and helps our allies on the ground, air, and sea. However, globalization has provided American companies with cheap materials and labor outside the US lowering the amount of available jobs here in the US.
The globalization affects my personal life in three aspects: education, technology, and food. As a ...

In order to do that, economists have relied for the past seventy years or so on two basic tools: fiscal policy and monetary policy. The first concerns how the government taxes and spends; the second concerns the action of the central bank (in America, that’s the Federal Reserve), which controls the supply of money. While both tools are complex, the main thing to understand is that they both have an accelerator and a brake pedal. If the economy is overheating, with spending overtaking new production of goods and services, resulting in a bidding spiral and increasing inflation, we can hit the brakes. If the economy is moving too slowly, with spending not keeping pace with the production of goods and services, we can hit the gas. Free Money To Quit Your Job

An accomplished student and athlete at George Mason University was not accepted to any sororities at the university. Her sister Lillie believes this is because she has Down syndrome.

[...] Federal Grant Procurement Rules
While federal grant levels vary from year to year (sometimes extremely), big federal grants are common and awards frequently range from $500,000 to millions of dollars. It’s great to bring in big federal dollars to support your work, but remember, once you win big grant awards you’ve got to manage them in compliance with an extensive roster of rules and regulations. If you’re a beginner grants professional, you’ll also need help learning to manage federal funding correctly. Federal grant money must be spent only on approved activities, must be managed to comply with regulations, and is expected to result in measurable results. Free federal grant money is not a reality.

Although you inform that I will have to wait 30 days to receive the reward but only 10 days the money got into my Paypal , and it's free, I am very happy about this.

Forward guidance consists of trying to reassure the markets that the Fed funds rate will stay low for a long time after full employment is reached, thereby calming fears that the Fed will step on the brakes the moment employment returns to normal levels. Quantitative easing is when the Fed uses newly printed money to purchase Treasury bonds and other financial assets, with the idea of pushing down longer-term interest rates and forcing money out into the economy. Economists and financial wonks can (and do) discuss the relative merits of these policies all day, but the one thing that almost everyone agrees on is that while they helped us avoid a full-blown depression, they did not restore full employment—or anything even close to it. Since the crisis, both output and employment growth has been weak. Free Money Phone Tap

Grants for college students fall across two broad categories, depending on what eligibility requirements are attached to the funds. Need-based grants are issued to students exhibiting the greatest levels of financial hardship in paying for college. On the other hand, merit-based grants are tied to performance-like good grades and other personal achievements. Free Money By Vice
In the sometimes-unsure footing of the federal grants world, our attorneys also work with clients to create the solutions that are right for their programs – from negotiation and drafting sub-recipient and contractor agreements to facilitating affiliations, collaborations, and partnerships between grantees and other parties. And while such action may be a last resort, our Federal Grants group has assisted many clients in responding to audit findings, government inquiries, cost disallowances, and more, and our attorneys have represented clients in negotiations and litigation at all judicial levels.

While depression economics has many strange features, the most important one to remember is this: with slack in the economy, it’s possible to have an economic free lunch. If our economy were running at capacity, new government spending, for example, would tend to create inflation because the capacity (workers, raw materials, and equipment) would have to be bid away from someone else, thereby raising prices. But during a depression that doesn’t happen. Instead, new spending brings idle capacity into production. To put that another way, the single-most-important underpinning of a functioning economy is to ensure that there is sufficient aggregate demand. Federal Grant Income Limits
You will need thorough documentation of the problem your organization will address. No matter what you need the funding to accomplish—funding to help children succeed, funding to help the homeless, funding to help build healthy communities, funding for the arts, etc.—you’ll need lots of facts and figures that show what the situation you are concerned about looks like in your service area, why it is significant, and why it is happening. Start gathering data now and keep it current.
Currently this film has a 4.8 rating here at IMDb but in my opinion, VERY unjustly so! It teeters constantly between quirky, sweet humor, and macabre, almost cartoonish dark comedy. Which is to say, it's quintessential Brando. There's even a brief freeze-frame in the film of Brando with his hands flapping by his face in a 'neah-neah' gesture that is so 'Brandoesque'. He knows that his physical presence (a seemingly 500-pound ballet dancer) is a grand mixture of Father Christmas, Charlie Chaplin, Edward G. Robinson, and the man who bites off the heads of chickens at the circus. You just never know what you're going to get with him, so you - and the other characters in the film - are always kept a bit on edge (he played a somewhat similar character in "The Freshman"; another film that I've always thought was underrated).

Walrus-like warden, Sven "Swede" Sorenson, a cross between Bluto and Wimpy, runs the prison, murders convicts who escape, and has the FBI on his trail in the form of agent Karen Polarski, the daughter of the town's corrupt judge. Swede's twins tell their father they're pregnant (they aren't), so he pushes their dim boyfriends, Bud and Larry, into shotgun marriages. He also turns his sons-in-law into slave labor, so Bud hatches an escape plan: to rob a train carrying old bills to the mint for burning. Larry's his reluctant accomplice. When Bud is captured and railroaded into Swede's jail, his death looks certain, until he hatches yet another plan that requires Larry's help. Written by Federal Grant Subawards

This is why income inequality is dangerous: it is a drag on aggregate demand. As inequality increases, as it has in the U.S., the drag grows commensurately. Stagnant wages mean that consumer borrowing must be steadily increased to keep the economy moving forward. Meanwhile, the fruits of growth flowing to the top mean a vast pile-up in savings and associated asset bubbles, and the recessions that follow are harder and harder to recover from. In other words, keeping an economy that suffers from galloping economic inequality pressurized and growing requires an economic policy regime that contains the seeds of its own destruction. And this leads us to where we are now: consumers today can’t stomach any more debt, interest rates have hit the floor, and a grinding, low-level depression is upon us. Welcome to 2014.

Why hasn’t the helicopter money option already been enacted? The main reason is simply that until very recently we thought we had cured chronic shortages of aggregate demand, so no one was really thinking about these issues. The other reason is that Congress has not yet gotten it together to pass a law allowing the Fed to cut checks to the American people. Federal Need Grant
A Categorical Grant is slightly more specific, and can only be used for precise and spelled-out purposes. Recipients of these grants must often "match" the funds provided by the government, or at least provide a portion of the overall cost. These are the most common grants provided, and an estimated 90% of grants distributed by the US Government fall into the categorical grant realm. Free Money No Catch
