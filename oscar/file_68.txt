In the modern private collection, the need for a central idea must be fully recognized. Neither the collector nor the curator can be content to keep a mere curiosity shop. It is the collector's business to illustrate his central idea by his choice of examples, by the care with which he describes them and the skill with which they are arranged.
Those words were true in 1911; they remain true a century later. A central idea for your book collection helps you stay focused, save time and money, and avoid unnecessary accumulation.
But what should you collect? How can you stay focused? While there are many ways to build a collection, here are several of the tried-and-true routes:
1. The Author Collection: In this collection, you build an entire collection of books by a particular author. Typically, this means buying all the first editions of an author's work, but a more comprehensive view includes reprints, foreign translations, special editions, and magazine appearances. Building an author collection is an expensive undertaking if you want to go after prominent authors. However, you can build an inexpensive collection by focusing on an up-and-coming author, or a favorite author who has been overlooked by history. A variation on the author collection is the illustrator collection  buying all the books illustrated by a particular artist.
2. The List Collection: In this collection you start with a simple, well-established list ( Pulitzer Prize winners , for example, or Man Booker Prize winners ) and then go out and buy all the books featured on that list. Once again, this collection would typically focus on the first editions of these works, but could be more expansive in its scope, including reprints, classic editions, etc. Other non-prize-winning lists include the Rivers of America books, the Baedeker guidebooks to Europe, or the American Guide Series .
3. The Topical Collection: The topical collection is limited only by your creativity. I've interviewed a young man, for example, who was busy collecting everything he could find about the 1972 Munich Olympics for the benefit of his dissertation. Now that's a cool and unexpected book collection to browse on the shelf. Similarly you could collect books about trout fishing in Montana, books about 20 th century golfing in Scotland, books praising the virtues of Cuban tobacco, or adventure novels set in Africa. The potential list of topics is endless. Topical book collections are often well used by their collectors.
4. The Aesthetic Collection: This collection views its chosen books as art objects. You might collect publisher's binding books for example, or books with dust jackets illustrated by a favorite artist ( such as Edward Gorey ), or 19 th century sheet music with color lithograph covers, or books bound in vellum. Building an aesthetic collection is similar to building a small art collection. You purchase the books because they look awesome.
And of course you don't have to limit yourself to just one type of collection; I have one of each of the above types. Regardless of the sort of collection you build, consider with each purchase how the specific selection echoes and enhances the central theme expressed in your library. This will help you stay focused and not lose yourself in the pursuit. (Book collecting, as with any collection, bears some similarities  both positive and negative  to hunting and gambling.)
A good rule of thumb is to purchase the nicest copy you can afford. What does this mean? Get the book in the best condition relative to your budget. When you are browsing books online or in a bookseller's catalogue, you will notice that booksellers classify their books according to a roughly-standard rubric of grades that begins at Fine and descends to Poor:
Fine means the copy is essentially mint, probably unread, showing no signs of wear or use, especially considering its relative age.
Near Fine means it's close to fine, but with a few very minor defects, which the bookseller will elaborate on in the book's description.
Very Good means the book has a defect or two of some note, which again will be elaborated upon in the description.
Poor is a reading copy only, not well-suited for a purposeful book collection (unless the book is extremely rare).
Of course each bookseller's definition of what exactly differentiates a Fine book from a Near Fine book, and so on, is subjective, but these grades work well as general guidelines.
A word about dust jackets: get them if you can. Try to find books with their original dust jackets and again, try to get them in the best condition you can afford (sometimes of course this isn't feasible). Dust jackets are rated on the same scale from Fine to Poor, and they make a huge difference in the value of the book. Example: a first edition of The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald will set you back a few grand. But a first edition with its original dust jacket? Well over $100k. Seriously. So get those dust jackets. And protect them with Mylar covers, available at paper and office suppliers like Demco and Brodart. ( Read more about the first edition of The Great Gatsby and why it's so valuable. )
Now, how do you track down your books? Browsing the bookshelves of a used bookshop is cool and opens the doors to serendipity, but you'll also want to harness the ample power of the Internet to find specific books for your collections. Abebooks.com and Biblio.com are two excellent aggregate sites for tracking down rare and out-of-print material, which you can then purchase from independent booksellers around the world. eBay is also a treasure in this regard.
If you'd like some help getting started, seek the advice of a rare book dealer. They are easily found online through the Antiquarian Booksellers Association of America , many of whom would welcome the opportunity to help a new collector start navigating these murky waters.
Don't be a hoarder. Sell the books no longer relevant to your collection. As you find nicer copies of books in your collection, sell the lesser versions. eBay is a great outlet for this.
Be savvy on eBay. Learn how to save searches. Learn how to search completed listings to see how much similar titles have sold for in the past. Get a sense of a book's value, and then bid accordingly the next time the title comes up for auction. Keep an eye open for deals.
Know your material. Learn all you can about your chosen genre/topic/author/illustrator. You'll be able to spot interesting material  and bargains  that will fit into your overall theme.
Cultivate a relationship with a rare book dealer. He or she will offer you interesting material related to your collection before advertising it publicly (where it might be offered at a higher price).
Buy direct from a bookseller. Sites like Abebooks.com or Biblio.com are awesome for collectors, but they take a commission off of each sale from booksellers. As a result, some booksellers offer their books cheaper if you buy direct from them or from their own website. Especially with more expensive books, investigate this option before purchasing.
Regardless if you become a dedicated book collector or just aim to assemble the important books of your life, remember this quote about self-sufficiency from Cicero, Anyone who has a library and a garden wants for nothing. So let's all want for nothing.

Chancellor Phillip Hammond announced a handful of relief schemes for those hardest hit by increases in liability resulting from the 2017 Rating Revaluation. This amounts to an additional £435m in relief to that already provided by the transitional rates relief scheme. This includes:
Support for businesses losing small business rates relief as a result of an increase in rateable value – a mandatory scheme.
A £300m pot for Billing Authorities to grant discretionary relief to those hardest hit by increases in liability – usual discretionary rules apply.
Pubs with rateable value of less than £100,000 to get a £1,000 discount on rates they pay – a mandatory scheme and similar to the old retail relief scheme.
So, there is a few hundred million to sprinkle around London and the South East but we still have to see fuller criteria for qualification for the hardship fund…
Interestingly, there is a recognition that the majority of the problems arise as a result of the delay in the revaluation with Government now clearly looking at delivering more frequent revaluations.
In the last couple of years, I have produced what I call "The Dead Mall Series," 32 short films and counting about dead malls. Now, for those of you who are not familiar with what a dead mall is, it's basically a shopping mall that has fallen into hard times. So it either has few shops and fewer shoppers, or it's abandoned and crumbling into ruin. No sale at Penny's.
I started producing this series in early 2015 after going through kind of a dark period in my life where I just didn't want to create films anymore. I put my camera away and I just stopped. So in 2015, I decided to make a short film about the Owings Mills Mall. Owings Mills Mall opened in 1986. I should know because I was there on opening day. I was there with my family, along with every other family in Baltimore, and you had to drive around for 45 minutes just to find a parking spot. So if you can imagine, that's not happening at the malls today.
My first mall job that I had as a teenager was at a sporting goods store called Herman's World of Sports. Maybe you remember.
Yeah, so I worked in a lady's shoe store. I worked in a leather goods store, and I also worked in a video store, and not being one who was very fond of the retail arts --
In between these low-paying retail jobs, I did what any normal teenager did in the 1990s. I shoplifted. I'm just kidding. I hung out with my friends at the mall.
Hanging out at the mall could be fun, but it could be really lame, too, like sharing a cigarette with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat who has put on black lipstick for the night while you're on your break from your crappy minimum wage job.
As I stand here today, Owings Mills has been gutted and it's ready for the wrecking ball. The last time I was there, it was in the evening, and it was about three days before they closed the mall for good. And you kind of felt -- they never announced the mall was closing, but you had this sort of feeling, this ominous feeling, that something big was going to happen, like it was the end of the road. It was a very creepy walk through the mall. Let me show you.
So when I started producing "The Dead Mall Series," I put the videos up onto YouTube, and while I thought they were interesting, frankly I didn't think others would share the enthusiasm for such a drab and depressing topic. But apparently I was wrong, because a lot of people started to comment. And at first the comments were like -- basically like, "Oh my God, that's the mall from my childhood. What happened?" And then I would get comments from people who were like, "There's a dead mall in my town. You should come and film it." So I started to travel around the mid-Atlantic region filming these dead malls. Some were open. Some were abandoned. It was kind of always hard to get into the ones that were abandoned, but I somehow always found a way in.
The malls that are still open, they always do this weird thing -- like the dead malls. They'll have three stores left, but they try to spruce it up to make it appear like things are on the up-and-up. For example, you'll have an empty store and they bring the gate down. So at Owings Mills, for example, they put this tarp over the gate. Right? And it's got a stock photo of a woman who is so happy and she's holding a blouse, and she's like --
So the comments just kept pouring in on the videos, from all over the country, and then all over the world. And I started to think, this could really be something, but I had to get creative, because I'm like, how long are people going to sit and watch me waddling through an empty mall?
So the original episodes I filmed with an iPhone. So I'd walk through the mall with an iPhone, and, you know. Like that.
And security -- because malls, they don't like photography -- so the security would come up and be like, "Put that away," and I'm like, "OK." So I had to get creative and sneaky, so I started using a hidden camera and different techniques to get the footage that I needed, and basically what I wanted to do was make the video like it was a first-person experience, like you are sitting -- put your headphones on watching the screen -- it's like, you're there in the video, like a video game, basically.
I also started to use music, collaborating with artists who create music called vaporwave. And vaporwave is a music genre that emerged in the early 2010s among internet communities. Here's an example.
That's by an artist named Disconscious from an album he did called "Hologram Plaza." So if you look that up, you can hear more of those tunes. Vaporwave is more than an art form. It's like a movement. It's nihilistic, it's angsty, but it's somehow comforting. The whole aesthetic is a way of dealing with things you can't do anything about, like no jobs, or sitting in your parents' basement eating ramen noodles. Vaporwave came out of this generation's desire to express their hopelessness, the same way that the pre-internet generation did sitting around in the food court.
One of my favorite malls I've been to is in Corpus Christi, and it's called the Sunrise Mall. When I was a kid, my favorite thing to do was watch movies, and I used to watch movies over and over and over again. And one of my favorite films was "The Legend of Billie Jean." Now, for those of you who have seen "The Legend of Billie Jean," you'll know that it's a great film. I love it. And Helen Slater and Christian Slater -- and if you didn't know, they are not related. Many people thought that they were brother and sister. They're not. But anyway, Sunrise Mall was used in the film as a filming location. The mall is exactly the same as it was in 1984. We're talking 32 years later. Let me show you.
(Video) Dan Bell: And here's Billie Jean running across the fountain, being chased by Hubie Pyatt's friends. And she jumps over here. And you can see the shot right here is what it looks like today. It's pretty incredible. I mean, honestly, it's exactly the same. And there they are falling in the fountain, and she runs up the stairs. This is a nice shot of the whole thing here.
I always think in my head, if I owned a dead mall -- why don't they embrace their vintage look? Put in a bar, like, put vegan food in the food court and invite millennials and hipsters to come and drink and eat, and I guarantee you within three weeks H & M and Levi's will be banging on the door trying to get space. I don't know why they don't do this, but apparently, it's only in my mind, it goes all day.
I remembered something, though. I put my camera down three or four years ago, and it took going to these malls for me to be inspired again. And to see my audience and people from all over the world writing me and saying, "God, I love your videos," is incredible. I don't know how to even explain it, as an artist, how fulfilling that is. If you would have told me a year ago that I would be standing on this stage talking to all of you wonderful people, I would have never believed it. I am humbled and so appreciative.
In the last couple of years,/ I have produced/ what I call "The Dead Mall Series,/"/ 32 short films/ and counting about dead malls.//
Now,/ for those of you/ who are not familiar/ with what a dead mall is,/ it's basically/ a shopping mall/ that has fallen into hard times.//
I started producing/ this series/ in early 2015/ after going through kind of a dark period/ in my life/ where I just didn't want to create/ films anymore.//
I was there with my family,/ along/ with every other family/ in Baltimore,/ and you had to drive around/ for 45 minutes just/ to find a parking spot.//
My first mall job/ that I had as a teenager was at a sporting goods store called Herman's World of Sports.//
I worked in a leather goods store,/ and I also worked in a video store,/ and not being one/ who was very fond of the retail arts --/ (Laughter)/
Hanging out/ at the mall could be fun,/ but it could be really lame,/ too,/ like sharing a cigarette/ with a 40-year-old unemployed mall rat/ who has put on black lipstick/ for the night/ while you're on your break/ from your crappy minimum wage job.//

This weekend I'll be spending some time at Con Nooga, one of the surprisingly many sci-fi/fantasy/horror/anime/comic/gaming, etc. cons that take place here in the relatively small city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA (you can read about one of the others, Chattacon, here). I also attended Con Nooga in 2016 and 2017 (see photographic evidence above!), so this will be my third Con Nooga.
Con Nooga has a slightly more Comicon-type feel to it, with a large vendors' area and (sadly) no con suite. It draws a somewhat younger, more diverse crowd than many other cons around these parts, maybe partly due to the emphasis on anime, comics, and video games. There are always a lot of young people dressed up as anime characters I've never heard of, which is in no way a criticism of the kids today -- I love their energy!
This year I volunteered to serve on several panels (I did one last year, which was fun!). I'll be on the following panels:
I'm also excited for the Hogwarts House Debate (Friday at 7pm), a Lovecraft radio program (Saturday at 1pm), the annual Star Wars vs. Star Trek debate (Saturday at 2pm), a panel on Stranger Things (Saturday at 9pm), "Welcoming Our Robot Overlords" (Sunday at 1pm), and more stuff I will discover when I get there!
In an innovative approach, the Earth Observation satellite based air pollution mapping and traffic emissions models will be integrated with health risk models. The resulting developed service will be a user friendly software application available to city planners and health policy decision makers. Such a software package would provide direct answers in terms of population health consequences (morbidity, mortality, hospitalisation, health costs) to allow appropriate and highly relevant comparisons of city planning options (such as traffic regulation, public transit and road construction) affecting the urban environmental conditions.
Demonstration of applicability of atmospheric satellite Earth Observations for urban planning and population health care in particular;
Induction and implementation of the developed software application to the City of Ottawa, which is identified as the prime user of the service.

The mission of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is to ensure the political, educational, social and economic equality of rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination.
The vision of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is to ensure a society in which all individuals have equal rights and there is no racial hatred or racial discrimination.
The following statement of objectives is found on the first page of the NAACP Constitution – the principal objectives of the Association shall be:
To educate persons as to their Constitutional Rights and to take all lawful action to secure the exercise thereof
and furtherance of these objectives, consistent with the NAACP’s Articles of Incorporation and this Constitution.
The DuPage County Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has been active in the county for more than 50 years. It was chartered in November 1956.
Prior to 1953, the DuPage County Branch was an affiliate member of the Maywood Branch. In 1953, William Alexander and Nathaniel Odom called a meeting at Second Baptist Church on Crescent Street in Wheaton, Illinois. Nathaniel Odom was elected the first president of the DuPage County Branch, NAACP.
Nathaniel Odom, a brick mason and general contractor, migrated from Oklahoma to Wheaton. Housing in Wheaton, and for the most part in the Western Suburbs, was not available for Blacks, so he built his own home. Over the years, he and other building tradesmen built homes for other Blacks.
Blacks in DuPage County worked primarily as domestics, chauffeurs, landscapers, Pullman porters and caterers. Although limited in job opportunities, many sent their children to college. Because of limited housing and job opportunities, most graduates were forced to seek employment in other cities or states.
In 1957, Ollie Matthews and Zady Odom organized the Woman’s Auxiliary of the DuPage County Branch. Over the years, their fundraisers were the major financial support for the Branch and the Youth Council. As a result of the consensus of the National Body, the Women’s Auxiliary was renamed Women in the NAACP (WIN) in 1999.
In 1966, the first Open Housing March in the Western Suburbs was held in Wheaton, Illinois. The Branch also supported marches in Aurora and Weston, Illinois. Weston was the proposed site for the Atomic Energy Commission’s construction of the multi-million-dollar atomic particle accelerator known as Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Also, in 1966, the first Scholarship Banquet was held at Stouffer’s Hotel in Oak Brook, Illinois.
On September 20, 1966, Claude Audley, President of DuPage County Branch, submitted the Branch’s proposal for a Fair Housing Ordinance to the Wheaton City Council. In 1967, the City Council of Wheaton passed the first Fair Housing Ordinance in the Western Suburbs of DuPage County. In 1967, 1968 and 1969, more than 30 towns and cities in the Western Suburbs passed Fair Housing Ordinances.
In 1966, as a result of the efforts of the NAACP in cooperation with the Chicago Urban League, trade unions began recruiting Blacks for apprenticeship training in the construction trades. On January 19, 1967, Sydney C. Finley Jr. and Claude Audley, representing the DuPage County Branch, along with representatives from the Chicago Branch, went to Washington, D.C. to meet with the officials of the Atomic Energy Commission. Recommendations were made that a Commission on Equal Opportunity be a major component of the Atomic Energy Commission. It was recommended that guidelines be established to give access to minorities in all skilled trades at Fermilab. The availability of housing and job opportunities would be a major criterion for site selection and construction of the accelerator at Fermilab.
During Charlie Thurston’s presidency (1977-78), he used his financial and money management skills to help the Branch increase its scholarship fund substantially. Over the years, many high school graduates have been awarded four-year scholarships and grants.
Under the administrations of Louis Garland, Ernest Gibson, Carolyn Gibson, Lonnie McIntosh, Olivia Garth, James Rickmond, Marvin Byrd, Frank Jarrett, and Rev. Theresa A. Dear, the areas of civil rights, legal redress, voter registration and job opportunities in the suburban public schools and colleges were vigorously and unselfishly pursued. The officers and hundreds of volunteers continued to work diligently to make a better life for African Americans in the Western Suburbs.
During the Presidency of Theresa Dear beginning in 2003, the Branch experienced great success including growing our Freedom Fund dinner to an average of 600+ attendees, launching a website, establishing the Sydney C. Finley Memorial Scholarship Fund, building the SCF Scholarship Fund from one-year awards to two-year awards, establishing the Claude Audley Leadership Excellence Award, establishing the Barack Obama Young Political Leader’s Award and becoming the second largest branch in the state. One of the most significant accomplishments was having an unknown community organizer, Barack Obama, speak at our Freedom Fund banquet and later become the 44th President of the United States of America.
Mario L. Lambert became president in 2011 after serving four years as Vice President. So far, he has led efforts for high impact youth programs, increased community-wide brand awareness, created a responsive legal redress team, and ignited involvement with the volunteer base. To date, sponsorship has increased over 100%.

This quantity includes an version, translated into English and with an intensive creation, of the Arabic translation and statement at the booklet of Esther by way of one of many preeminent litterateurs of the Karaite "Golden Age" (10th-11th centuries), Yefet ben 'Eli ha-Levi. Yefet's textual content represents the 1st thoroughly extant, dedicated observation on Esther and, therefore, offers interesting perception into the historical past and improvement of exegetical notion in this ebook, either one of the Karaites in addition to the Rabbanites.
One of many contemporary accomplishments of Biblical scholarship is the systematic and precise description of the oral and literary styles present in the previous testomony. It used to be Hermann Gunkel (1862-1932) who initiated the form-critical strategy, thereby including to the exegetical instruments of Biblical scholarship an tool which proves to be an efficient assist in the translation of the outdated testomony.
An Upanisad is a instructing consultation with a guru, and the 13 texts of the critical Upanisads which include this quantity shape a sequence of philosophical discourses among instructor and pupil that query the internal that means of the area.

-glorified squash match, but Frontenac, a young newcomer hailing from Montreal did get a bit of offense in.
Rogue makes it clear as mud in his own special language that he is not done with Mercury and wants another crack at him (da lully prigger).
Vendetta & Mike Lozansky defeated Hoyt Daill & Yuri Gordienko by pinfall when Vendetta pinned Daill after a DDT at 5:13
-squash match. No real reason to see the heavyweight champ and television champ team up but it was a neat little attraction for the fans.
Vendetta and Mike Lozansky's interview is dissrupted by Troy Galveston. He gets into Lozansky's face saying he wants a title shot. He says he'll find a tag partner and beat them both if he has too. He doesn't have to look far or wait long though because seconds later Bob Orton Jr. comes out to the ring and offers to tag with Galveston against these two next week. Vendetta says that would be fine but they both have matches yet tonight and there may not be much left of them after Shayne Tustin and Jack Steele get ahold of them.
Bulldog Blades & Horace Curtis defeated Al Dusha & Bert Meijer by pinfall when Blades pinned Dusha after a bulldog at 7:04
Bulldog Blades & Horace Curtis try to convince everyone that they deserve to still be in the tag team title picture.
-solid match that went back and forth, and both men seemed to be fighting for their professional future. In the end Galveston seemed to have the ability to take a lot of punishment and still storm back. He out punched Tustin on the floor and drove his back into the ringpost. Back inside he hit a pair of shoulderblocks, a flying dropkick and then his finisher.
Troy Galveston says he just proved he deserves a title shot against Mike Lozansky and if this didn't do it for everyone, then next week he will prove it with Orton by laying a beating on Vendetta and Lozansky.
Maxine attacked the champ before the opening bell and pounded on her unrelenting for the first two minutes, not once allowing her to get to her feet. Finally from her back Hollywood kicked Maxine off then when she came back for more took her down with a scisors. Hollywood back on her feet attacked with a stick and move offense that worked for a couple minutes. But with Maxine not taking any heavy damage it was only a matter of time before the Amazonian caught the champ, and she did with a chop to the throat. Maxine slapped Hollywood around in a powerful but awkward manner. Twice Hollywood managed to kick her way to a release from a chokebomb. But the third time, after Hollywood missed with a splash from the top rope, Maxine lifted her high in the air and slammed her to the mat, for the 1, 2, 3 !!
Lady Maxine says puny, hair teasing, loose morals girls like Hollywood are a way of the past in pro wrestling now. Women are becoming much more powerful and able, the same as they are in society. Barbie girls like Hollywood will no longer be the rolemodels of choice for young girls, they now have strong rolemodels like herself to emmulate.
Top Guns defeated Bryan St. John & Terry Orndorff by pinfall when Rice pinned St. John after a double dropkick at 9:50
-after a fast paced first couple of minutes, Orndorff slowed things down by grabbing an armbar on Dukes. He and St. John then took turns working over the arm and neck of Dukes, grounding him and illiciting chants of "boring" from the faithful. Finally Dukes was able to roll out of it to make a tag. Rice came in a house o' fire but after a minute he too was subdued, this time from a double team. After taking a minute of abuse he fought back, and made a blind tag out to Dukes. The Top Guns were back in charge and isolated Orndorff, making very quick tags which allowed them some subtle double teaming. Finally this broke down into a four man brawl and when the smoke cleared the champions threw Orndorff over the top rope, hit St. John with a double dropkick and picked up the win.
The Top Guns say that St. John and Orndorff may have been their toughest challenge to date, but now that they are past them there are other worthy teams who may deserve a title shot. They talk about the incoming team of Owen Hart & Chris Benoit, as well as the young duo of Bulldog Blades & Horace Curtis.
-Steele controlled the first two-thirds of this match with Orton either being whipped from pillar to post or trying to evade Steele. But Orton mounted a short and spirited comeback with fists, an atomic drop, and banging Steele's head off the announce table. Orton tried for the piledriver to finish the match but Steele countered with a back bodydrop. Steele then went on a tear, but when he tried to end the match with a running kneelift, Orton read it and moved away at the last second. Steele hit the mat like he stepped on an invisible bannana peel, Orton droped an elbow, followed up wth a bodyslam, a neckbreaker, and then his piledriver to finish the match.
Orton looked to hit a second piledriver on Steele but Vendetta hit the ring to stop him. Galveston then came charging in to make it 2 on 1 in the staredown. But Steele managed to make it to his feet so Orton dragged Galveston away from the fight.
Shayne Tustin voices his disgust that Troy Galveston is now hanging out with the likes of Bob Orton. He says he plans to continue to build his own career on a solid foundation of trust and hardwork, and while he may have lost the battle to Galveston he fully expects to win the war.
Paramount pictures is proud to release to theatres this weekend, the action-thriller, "The Presidio" starring Sean Connery, Mark Harmon, and Meg Ryan.
The Presidio Army Base, San Fransisco. When a landmark of historic tradition becomes the scene of a shocking murder, a military commander and a street-tough cop are forced into action... against the killer, the mysterious past, and each other.
Jack Steele refers to his loss to Orton last week as a minor setback, not the end of the line. He comments that he likes the attitude displayed earlier by the young guy Tustin.
Baron von Raschke calls out Bryan St. John & Terry Orndorff. While the Baron makes it clear he doesnt like them or their tactics, he is here tonight because they deserve one more title shot at the Top Guns. Raschke says he watched the tape of their match last week after receiving their protests and they are right, Bryan St. John was not the legal man when he was pinned last week. Therefore they will receive their rematch in tonight's main event.
Owen Hart & Chris Benoit defeated Bulldog Blades & Horace Curtis by pinfall when Hart pinned Curtis after a flying bodypress from the top buckle at 6:08
-solid match that began and ended with a handshake between two fan favorite teams. However, Blades and Curtis are not at the same level yet as Hart and Benoit.
Owen Hart & Chris Benoit say they have come to RCW from Stampede for a change of scenery, and are looking forward to some new competition. Specifically they mention that they would love to face the Top Guns, but have their sites obviously set on the titles held by Bryan St. John & Terry Orndorff.
-Revelation of elaborate plot concocted by Oliver North to draw Libya dictator Muammar el-Kadhafi out of hiding by using British hostage negotiator Terry Waite so that Kadhafi could be killed
-Possibility that Iran is interested in reaching better relations with United States; Iran is realizing its international isolation is damaging. Possibility that Reagan can put an end to the Iran-Iraq war.
-wow, strange quick ending. After only a brief skirmish they locked up and Rogue snuck in a hard looking forearm smash to the chin of Mercury who dropped like a stone and Rogue got an incredibly quick victory. Because the ref was Buddy Lane he actually forced Rogue to show him his bracer, but when Lane inspected it, he found it was nothing but cloth. It appears like this was just a fluke, luck of the draw incident.
Rogue says the fans shouldn't be surprised at what happened because Mercury is nothing short of a thatch-gallow, and he 'ad dat hue a cummin. Time for that fancy pants to pad, e be a rattling mumper now eh...this was followed by a raspy laugh and coughing fit. Rogue makes it semi-clear he is done with Mercury and now wants a shot at the gold.
Troy Galveston & Bob Orton Jr. defeated Mike Lozansky & Vendetta by pinfall when Orton pinned Lozansky after a piledriver at 8:33
-great match to showcase all 4 men, as they each had their turn giving out punishment and each had their turn taking as well. Very even match, with Galveston turning things around by catching Lozansky in the back of the head with a rabbit punch from the apron. This allowed the legal man Orton to follow up with the piledriver and steal the win.
Troy Galveston and Bob Orton Jr are elated with their win. They both have title shots next week, Galveston against Lozansky and Orton against Vendetta, and both see gold in their near future.
Orndorff started the match which was a new look from the challengers. He put Dukes in a side headlock and worked it for a good minute standing up and then on the mat before tagging out to St. John.
St. John worked the headlock on the mat then went to a headscissors which Dukes was eventually able to pop out of, but he was stopped from making the tag. St. John whipped Dukes to the corner and then distracted referee Buddy Lane while Orndorff choked Dukes. Rice made the mistake of trying to make the save, so St. John was able to pull up on the legs of Duke while his partner choked him. St. John then nailed Dukes with a vertical suplex and covered for a 1 count.
Tag out and Orndorff worked a half-nelson while Dukes tried to gain momentum. He almost had the tag but Orndorff knocked Rice off the ring apron and then gave Dukes a devastating waistlock suplex for a 2 count. The punishment continued for a couple more minutes before Dukes was finally able to fight his way through St. John and make the hot tag.
Rice went to work on Orndorff and when St. John tried to interfere Rice spun Orndorff around and St. John nailed his own partner with a knee to the chest. Rice covered but St. John broke it up with a boot to the back of his head. Rice tagged out to Dukes who came off the top rope with an elbowdrop and covered Orndorff for 1, 2 kickout.
Dukes had Orndorff in trouble and isolated and then it was Rice's turn, but neither could get the pinfall. Orndorff was eventually able to knock Rice into the corner and make the tag out to St. John. Rice welcomed him into the ring with flying scissors, then cradled his legs up for 1, 2, Orndorff came back into the ring and planted a solid kick right in the chest of Rice. This brought in Dukes and we had a 4 man brawl. The bad blood was allowed to boil over for a minute before Lane finally restored order.
After a commercial break we find Rice going toe to toe with St. John. Rice takes him down with a double leg but St. John kicks him in the knee dropping him like a stone. St. John then uses his leg like an axe from his back and chops the fallen Rice in four different spots. St. John then laid Rice neck first across the second strand and came off the far ropes landing and bouncing on him. St. John continues to work on Rice, and then Orndorff does, but eventually he is able to roll through and tag out to Dukes. Derrick goes to work on Orndorff with a standing drop kick, and a Mexican armdrag. He then nails Orndorff with an atomic drop and follows up with a butt drop. As Orndorff prances around the ring holding his tail bone Dukes tagged out to Rice. They were going to hit the double dropkick but St. John leaned over the top rope and was able to grab Rice by the back of the hair pulling him into the corner. This distracted Dukes and for his trouble he received a clothesline from behind. Orndorff then nailed a full-nelson slam, and a flying shoulderblock for a 2 count. He tagged out to St. John who went for the spinebuster but Dukes read it, blocked it, flipped around behind St. John. He tried to pull St. John over for a suplex but it was blocked, so he drove St. John forward toward the ropes. But St. John ducked through the ropes and Orndorff laid a kick in from the apron and nailed Dukes square on his head which was sticking out between ropes. St. John followed up sending Dukes to the ropes and then launching him straight into the air so he would land face first on the mat. He then sent Dukes to the ropes one more time and hit the spinebuster slam for the 1, 2, 3 !!! New tag champions
Bryan St. John & Terry Orndorff defeated Ricky Rice & Derrick Dukes by pinfall when St. John pinned Dukes after a spinebuster slam at 18:05
Bryan St. John & Terry Orndorff defeated Bulldog Blades & Horace Curtis by pinfall when Orndorff pinned Curtis after a flying shoulderblock at 9:16
-the champs took the youngsters way too lightly, and spent too much time showboating and fooling around early. They paid for it and made a late comeback and might have been fortunate to have emerged from this bout the winners.
Bryan St. John & Terry Orndorff deny taking the youngsters too lightly, instead they say that their opponents were cheating throughout the contest. The champs say they understand they have to defend their titles one more time against the former champs, Top Guns, next week, but that will be the end of the title shots for Rice and Dukes.
Jack Steele & Shayne Tustin defeated Terminator Riggs & Hoyt Daill by pinfall when Steele pinned Daill after a running kneelift at 7:30
-Daill ran into trouble early and was isolated by Steele and Tustin. Once he tagged out to Riggs, the former tag champion dominated the match. However, after failing to get the pin he tagged out to Daill, and then when he asked for a return tag a minute later Daill went for an unadvised splash into the corner instead. Tustin moved out of the way, tagged out to Steele who hit a pair of clotheslines and then his finisher to win the bout.
Jack Steele and Shayne Tustin seem to have struck up a friendship and may decide to tag more often with each other. They are interrupted though by a returning Terminator Riggs. He claims he was victimized by having a lousy partner and says neither one of them could last 5 minutes alone with him in the ring next week. It looks like Steele was about to accept when Tustin put an arm on his shoulder and said "I got this one". So its Riggs against Tustin next week.
Ultra-Vixen doesn't seem to know how to conduct herself for an interview, so she just smiles, poses, and flirts a lot.
The crowd collectively groans when Makhan Singh comes to the ring wearing a Vancouver Canucks hockey jersey. He says he got this jersey from his good friend Mike Reno of Loverboy, and that the fans just don't like it cause the Jets suck. He says he had those skinny punks Hart and Benoit beat in Calgary, but before he could finish them off they took off to hide here in Whiner-peg. Well Singh says he came here to finish them off, and has a partner tonight to do just that.
Owen Hart & Chris Benoit defeated Yuri Gordienko & Makhan Singh by pinfall when Benoit pinned Gordienko after a diving headbutt at 7:28
-Singh acquited himself quite well, but like in the Riggs match earlier he found himself outgunned when Gordienko was dominated by his opponents. In the end Singh jumped off the apron and was already half way to the dressing room when the referee Jurgen Hermann counted the 1, 2, 3.
Owen Hart kids with the fans about the Canucks sucking, but that the Flames are the best team in hockey. Chris Benoit though begs to differ and brings up the Oilers which brings a huge jeer from the crowd. Hart and Benoit then play nice with the fans and pay RCW compliments before turning their attention onto Makhan Singh. Hart says Singh is a big fat liar, a big fat cheat, and just big and fat. He says they beat him and all his Karachi Vice goons back in Alberta and thats why they are here in RCW, to find new competition. Benoit says they beat him in Stampede, they beat him tonight, and they will continue to beat Makhan Singh.
Commissioner Baron Von Raschke is shown on a taped promo. He announces that River City Wrestling will be doing something a bit different this summer season. Starting with July 9th and going every week until the August 28th show, RCW will be visiting cities and towns previously thought too small to host an edition of River City Wrestling. Also, be assured that the quality of the shows will be top notch and to prove it the Heavyweight title will be on the line each week under a different circumstance of who will get the title shot. To put it a bit more plainly, just like small towns and cities deserve a chance to show they have what it takes to be big time, so do certain wrestlers that might not get a chance normally for the title. In addition to that, RCW has committed some funds to bring in some top notch tag teams from across the globe to compete for the fans. The Baron promises the fans of RCW some serious summer heat.
Cowboy Bob Orton and Troy Galveston come to the ring, and Galveston has adopted a cowboy hat and leather vest like Orton wears. Orton lets everyone know he thinks young Galveston has a ton of talent and has taken it upon himself to groom him to be a champion. Orton then goes on to say that Vendetta has disrespected him, and acts like Orton is something less then the legend that he is. The man who headlined the first ever WrestleMania, the man who put both High Flyers out of action. And after tonight the River City Wrestling Heavyweight champion.
Galveston thanks Orton for a week's worth of mentoring and training and says he has a few surprises in store for Mike Lozansky. Galveston says the training that he, Tustin, Blades, and others have received at the hands of Vic Gate now seems like a complete joke to him, compared to what the Cowboy has taught him in just a week. Tonight he will become the RCW television champion.
- a rare draw for RCW. Rogue was very upset at having to once again face Mercury after beating him in less then a minute last week. He tried for the same elbow to the jaw, but this time Mercury was able to block it and put him in an armbar. Rogue was a bit impatient early on and this allowed Mercury to wait, counter, and control the match. Rogue though settled down and controlled the action from about the 4th minute until the 12th minute, but was unable to pick up the win despite having 8 two counts. He twice went for the inverted DDT with Mercury able to push out of the first one, and counter the second with a swinging neckbreaker. The action spilled outside where after some fists Mercury reversed a whip to the guard rail and then gave Rogue a huge backbody drop. Back inside the final 2 minutes belonged to Mercury. He almost had Rogue but when he went for the hotshot, Rogue was able to put his arms out to absorb most of the blow. He then rolled out of the ring and Mercury had to give chase. Nick slammed him to the mat, rolled him back inside, and the bell went to signify a draw.
Mike Lozansky says he is looking forward to defending his title again, and despite not knowing too much about Troy Galveston, he assures the fans he does know that no one is going to take this belt from him easy.
Vendetta says he respects what Cowboy Bob Orton Jr has done in wrestling. He calls him a major player in WrestleMania, and the "cartooning" of wrestling. Vendetta says tonight the joke is over, "Ace" will be made to look like the joker, and the fans will have the last laugh.
The champ controlled early and this match looked like it was going to be a walk-over for Lozansky. He countered everything Galveston tried as if a little bird was telling him what his opponent's next move was going to be. However Galveston hung in there, and then turned things around when he went back to relying on the fisticuffs and chear shots. Galveston spent the next couple minutes taking the action as much outside the ring as in. Finally Lozansky gave up trying to make it a wrestling match and went toe to toe with the challenger until both men were counted out.
Referee Jurgen Hermann had broken the two men up, but Galveston then grabbed the ring bell and decimated Lozansky from behind, one shot to the back of the head.
The two start things off trading punches in the middle of the ring. Orton takes control by throwing a knee into the gut of the champ. He then slams Vendetta's head off the top buckle, but the champ just turns and looks at him. Orton slaps him across the face and slams his head onto the buckle again. But again the champ just turns and looks at Orton. The veteran goes for another slap but Vendetta blocks it, and twising his arm forces Orton to his knees, and then slams his entire weight down on top of the arm, driving it to the mat. Holding the arm down he lifts his legs up and drops a knee at the elbow junction, and then does the same two more times. Pulling Orton to his feet he works the armbar, twisting it over his head several times. Finally Orton gets to the ropes for a break, and sticks his neck between the ropes for a break. He then goes for delays and mindgames to frustrate the champ and allow himself time to recover.
Orton rakes the eyes of the champ, then rubs his head across the top rope, delivers a couple of chops, a bodyslam, a boot rake, and then several stomps. Orton works a reverse chinlock until the champ gets to his feet and drives his elbow into Orton's gut a few times to make him break. The champ comes flying off the ropes and takes the challenger down with a shoulderblock. But when he goes for it again Orton steps to the side and sends Vendetta flying over the top rope to the ground below.
Orton then follows Vendetta out of the ring, and throws him into the ringsteps, then again into the guardrail. Orton gets back into the ring but stops the champ from doing that on three occassions with bodyblocks. Finally he allows the champ back inside only to catch him with a knee raise, then a double legtakedown and follows up by dropping his heel into the "lower abdomen". Vendetta is rolling in pain and holding his groin, but Buddy Lane decides that it wasnt a clear low blow and lets Orton go with just a warning a delay. The man they call Ace then nails Vendetta with a piledriver. Instead of a lateral press though he places a foot on the champ's chest and gets 1, 2, shoulder up! Now he goes for a lateral press but is thrown off at a 1 count. But he goes for another press and is thrown off before Lane can even get down to count. He tries to get back on top but Vendetta nails him with a boot to "the lower abdomen" and again Lane is forced to give out a warning, this time to the champ.
Orton gets a break from Lane though and when Vendetta closes he is fed a taped thumb to the throat followed by a front chancery into a chokehold. Ace then lays in some boots, and then mounts the champs back and slaps him across the head from behind at will. Orton then goes for a second piledriver but Vendetta counters with a backflip.
We are 11 minutes into the match, and unfortunately out of television time. However, we will show the conclusion of the match at the start of our next week's show.
We left the match last week about 11 minutes in. We are told that the next few minutes were controlled by Vendetta and then some brawling in and out of the ring. We pick the match up again at around the 16 minute mark.
Vendetta slams Orton's head into each of the 4 turnbuckles, then climbs a 2nd turnbuckle, and springs off slamming Orton's head into the mat. He covers but only gets a 2 count. The champ lays in a bodyslam, covers and another 2 count. It is obvious that both men are near exhaustion and the fans are red hot.
Vendetta summons some strength and comes off the ropes taking Orton down with a shoulderblock, then does it a second time. He then waits for Orton to get back up and dropkicks him in the lower back, sending him into the turnbuckle. The champ then rolls him up on the rebound, for 1, 2, KICKOUT, just at the last possible instance. Vendetta slaps the mat a couple of times, picks Orton up by the hair, and is going for another bodyslam but Orton counters with a roll-up, 1, he grabs a handfull of tights, 2, KICKOUT. Vendetta catches the challenger with a kneelift, but when he goes for a dropkick Orton moves out of the way. With amazing speed Orton sets up Vendetta and delivers another piledriver. But he's exhausted and is very slow to cover, 1, 2, KICKOUT.
Frustrated Orton mounts the champ and lays in fists to the head, ignoring the refs instructions until Buddy Lane shoves Orton off of the champ. The challenger gets into a heated discussion with the ref, and after a slight push Lane gives Orton his final warning.
Vendetta has had time to recover and catches Orton with a clothesline. He then applies a full-nelson and after not getting the submission in 30 seconds he slams Orton to the mat. He sets him up for the DDT, and out of desperation Orton reaches out and grabs the waistband of Buddy Lane. At the last moment the champ notices this and aborts his finisher attempt and lays in a kick to the arm of Orton to get him to release his hold. He then goes to set up the DDT again, but its too late, and Orton drives him backward into the corner. The challenger then lays in his shoulder 5 times into the gut of Vendetta, biels him out and then kicks him squarely in the head. He covers, and gets a 2 count. Orton puts Vendetta in the standing headscissors but seems to change his mind. Instead of going for a piledriver he delivers a head twist instead, and then whips Vendetta to the corner. Now he lifts the champ onto the top buckle. He slowly sets him up for the superplex as the stunned fans get to their feet. But Vendetta holds on, and blocks the attempt. Orton tries again, and once more, each time both men adjust their feet and hands but appear at a stalemate.
That stalemate is finally won by Vendetta who jumps off the top, taking Orton down with him in a modified DDT from the top buckle! Everyone knows this match is over, as Vendetta covers, for 1, 2, 3 !!
Nick Mercury says that although it was complete redemption after losing by a fluke to Rogue in less then a minute, their 15 minute draw last week went a long way to healing some wounded pride. Now he wants one more shot at Rogue, next week in a no-time limit match. No time limits, no more excuses.
Blue Oyster Cult's "Don't Fear the Reaper" provides the music as we see clips of Vendetta's RCW heavyeight title reign.
Vendetta then says a few words about grudgingly having to give Bob Orton his respect after their match last week, a match that pushed him to his limit as no man has done since he became champion.
In his archaic tonuge Rogue manages to convey to the audience that he accepts the challenge of Nick Mercury (fancy pants) to a no-time limit match next week (the lolly prigger).
Bob Orton Jr. says that Vendetta got lucky last week, that his feet slipped on the piledriver the first time and referee Buddy Lane was slow on the count the second time and thats why he wasnt able to get the win. But the fans loved the match so much, and the Baron knows he can make serious money on a rematch, so Orton says it has bee signed. He will get another shot at Vendetta's title next week, July 2nd in Winnipeg.
Owen Hart & Chris Benoit defeated Makhan Singh & Hoyt Daill by pinfall when Hart pinned Daill after a cross bodyblock from the top rope at 8:09
-Singh did quite well with his size, strength, and liberal interpretation of the rulebook, but his partner Daill proved to be the weak link, as Gordienko was last week.
Owen Hart & Chris Benoit turn their attention to the tag team scene. They were excited to hear the Baron's announcement of world class tag team competition coming to RCW this summer and they say they have plans to compete here as well. They want a shot at the new tag team champs Wonderfully Fabulous, or the Top Guns whomever is champ after tonight's rematch.
Their interview though is interrupted by a returning Makhan Singh. He trades insults with Hart and Benoit but it doesn't get physical. He says he is sick of trying to find a decent partner around here, and wants to tear apart Owen Hart next week. He challenges Hart to a match, that is if his nursemaid will let him go on his own. Benoit and Hart control their anger enough to accept the challenge.
Baron von Raschke repeats his announcement that this summer RCW will be stopping each week in new towns and cities and that the Heavyweight title will be on the line each week, and great new tag teams will be brought into the territory to compete from all over the globe.
The Top Guns are the most quiet and intense we have seen them in RCW. They are totally focused on winning back their tag team gold tonight.
Shayne Tustin says his match against Terminator Riggs next is extremely important to him, as it represents his chance to climb another rung in the RCW ladder.
-fairly even match but Riggs exerted his power advantage when he needed it, and Tustin's effort to climb another rung in the RCW ladder was stopped by the former tag champion.
Wonderfully Fabulous, Bryan St. John & Terry Orndorff express that they are not concerned about the challenge of the former tag champion Top Guns tonight, and say the Baron can bring in whomever he wants from across the globe, from across the universe, from parts unknown for all they care. They will beat all comers. They suggest he bring in the NWA world champs and they will take those titles for themselves as well.
Bryan St. John & Terry Orndorff defeated Ricky Rice & Derrick Dukes by pinfall when Orndorff pinned Dukes after a flying shoulderblock at 9:20
-another even contest between these two teams, but the size and strength advantage of the champs, along with their willingness to cheat and flirt with disqualification were all they needed to win this bout.
We get a strange clip of a wobbly looking drunk leaving a local watering hole and wandering down the street.Suddenly three thugs accost him, obviously thinking he will be easy prey. But even drunk, the man is big and rises to the occassion, laying in fists, kicks, elbowsmashes, and bodyslams. One by one the thugs stumble and crawl away. The drunk looks into the camera as it closes in and says, "River City Wrestling...the Derelict is coming.." he then proceeds to belch.
Back and forth even match, but even though both men are relative youngsters, Lozansky showed that he is a step ahead of the less experienced Galveston. He maanged to counter a lot of Galveston's offense and the challenger on the other hand found it difficult to defend against the almost non-stop offensive outbursts from the champ.
Cowboy Bob Orton Jr comes down to the ring and puts a consoling arm around Galveston and walks him up the ramp while Lozansky celebrates with his title in the ring.
Emco Electronics’ Solid State Voltage Regulating Relay Type EE 301ET is used for regulating the secondary voltage of power transformer with on-load tap changer . The required dead-band settings are set by setting the L & R levels independently. The Time Delay setting on the front panel eliminates the relay operations for momentary fluctuations of the regulated voltage thus reducing the number of operations of the tap changer.
Integrated Tap Position Indicator eliminates the need of additional TPI for indication of Tap Number of OLTC. This reduces both on Space and Cost also reducing the wiring and making it easy.

The Android world is changing thanks to Motorola: the company offer devices without a custom user interface and it’s quick at getting software updates to phones. A low-cost tablet aims to bring tech to those who don’t have it while Samsung’s Gamepad debuts.Motorola announced a pair of KitKat upgrades this week, making it the handset MB STARmaker to deliver Android 4.4 the soonest. First the new Verizon(vz)(vod) line of phones — the Droid Ultra, Maxx and Mini — received the new software and as the week ended the Moto G followed suit. Motorola promised KitKat to the latter phone in early 2014. So what’s going on?Motorola is doing something with the platform that has been desired for a long time. The company is keeping the user experience and interface fairly standard, like the Nexus line of phones,The non-stick knife vertical of BRG offers aesthetically and ergonomically designed stainless. but engineering ways to add useful new features. This helps the handsets stand out from the crowd, keeps them simple to use and perhaps most importantly, makes it easier and faster to build software updates.I called this approach a “Nexus for the masses” because of its similarities to the Nexus device line Google maintains. While these are typically great devices, many consumers don’t know about them or won’t buy a phone from Google Play since they want to actually hold the device before buying it.Of course, the Motorola handsets aren’t “pure” Android, nor are they true Nexus devices. But they follow the concept closer than any others. And if you want a phone that will get Android software updates before most others, save for a Nexus or Google Play Edition device, Motorola should be your first look.
Motorola doesn’t make a tablet these days, so you’ll have to consider another hardware partner for your tablets needs. Could the $35 tablet for India be worth the look? The Aakash tablet line isn’t likely going to be your choice if you’re reading this site but for many who have no access to technology, it opens up a door.For $38 the U.S version of the UbiSlate offers a very basic mobile web and app experience. The hardware is akin to a 2010 tablet although it does run Android 4.garage equipments0.3. So it’s not something that most Gigaom readers would even look at. It’s aimed, however, at providing a first mobile experience for consumers that might not be able to afford one otherwise.Those that can afford the latest and greatest technology surely consider Samsung’s Galaxy line. And this week the company debuted a new accessory that works not just with Samsung products but with any phone running Android 4.1 or better. The new Samsung Gamepad adds hardware controls for gaming: an 8-way directional pad, two analog sticks, four Action buttons and a pair of triggers. It’s currently available in select European markets with additional availability planned in 2014.

MLM. Direct sales. Network marketing. If the sound of these words incite a sense of excitement and possibility in you, then you might have the mindset to make some money by being your own boss. You might already be considering going into mlm/direct sales/network marketing.
But where do you start? So how do you choose one? To be sure, you definitely should NOT just choose, at random, from an arbitrary list of direct sales businesses.
You shouldn’t go along with the first one you see. Just as you wouldn’t buy the first pair of shoes your eyes land on when you walk into the shoe store.
You want to find the one that will be the perfect fit for you. Otherwise, you might end up with a shoe that is 2 sizes too small, hurts your feet, and that you can’t even walk in.
When considering direct sales businesses, it is critical that you do your due diligence when choosing a company and opportunity to align yourself with. To not do so would be doing yourself a great injustice. I firmly believe that anyone with a pulse can find a company that is right for them. After all, all mlm/direct sales/network marketing is sharing products or services that you enjoy. And we ALL have those. I’m sure you can think of quite a few right now.
What you might not be able to think of is a list of direct selling companies that offer the products and services that you enjoy. It’s probably easy for you to think of some of the big direct sales businesses. Mary Kay. Avon. Tupperware. They have been around for what seems like forever. Our parents, grandparents and sometimes great-grandparents used the products. However, there are so many more opportunities out there, and I would hate for you to not learn about them. Your perfect opportunity by be hiding in that list of direct selling companies that you have never heard of.
So what I have done for you guys is done that first step for you. I have brainstormed and searched far and wide to be able to provide you with a master list of direct selling companies.
Now, I am only human, and the direct sales industry is constantly growing so my list of direct selling companies might (just might) be missing a few direct sales businesses that slipped under my radar. I ask for your forgiveness in advance.

Although it definitely is feasible to rework any room of the home, one that tends to be more difficult however yields extra benefits is remodeling the kitchen. One of many reasons why that is the case is because we tend to work within the kitchen each day and can seemingly have adjustments that we wish to make, once the transforming takes place. If you are going to be remodeling the kitchen, it is a good suggestion for you to rent a contractor and to guarantee that they're creative enough to observe your direction in addition to to present recommendations in line with their experience. Listed below are another suggestions that can provide help to by the process.
One of many things that many of us are focused on is saving somewhat bit of money on the transforming venture. If you'll be doing a significant remodeling, such as removing cabinets or even redoing the floor, it could possibly get quite expensive. One of many things that you are able to do to assist minimize down on the expenses can be to do as much of the work as you can handle on your own. In case you're not less than somewhat bit handy, you are able to do some further prep work and this may provide help to to save lots of as much materials as potential and to keep away from some of the further expense that may make it difficult to finances properly.
As with any type of reworking venture, you also needs to plan for some problems to happen. If in case you have a contractor that's going to deal with the majority of the work, it is seemingly that also they are aware of the possibility of problems. That's especially the case whenever you begin to tear out cabinets and begin to show the walls behind them. Difficulties such as mold, pipes in surprising locations and even crooked walls could make rebuilding the kitchen a difficult chore. With a certified contractor by your side, however, these problems will likely be much less more likely to extend the time-frame of the kitchen remodeling venture.
Lastly, make sure that you are an energetic part of the transforming venture from the begin to the end of it. It does not matter in case you are doing some of the work or not one of the work at all, it's your venture when all was stated and carried out. If you are unhappy about something that's happening throughout the venture, make sure that you communicate up about it and let the contractor know the way you feel. It is necessary that you're pleased with the completed venture so that you don't remorse any part of it as you're persevering with to use the kitchen.

To inspire us all I've started a list of famous Pirates. Model yourself on one of the real Pirates of yore, simply marvel at their dare devil lives or make up your own legends.
Edward Teach (c. 1680â€“ November 22, 1718), better known as Blackbeard, was a notorious English pirate in the Caribbean Sea and western Atlantic during the early 18th century, a period referred to as the Golden Age of Piracy. His best known vessel was the Queen Anne's Revenge, which is believed to have run aground near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina in 1718. Excavations of the site are ongoing and may have uncovered Blackbeard's cabin.
Blackbeard often fought, or simply showed himself, wearing a big feathered tricorn, and having multiple swords, knives, and pistols at his disposal. It was reported in the General History of the Pirates that he had hemp and lit matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle. Blackbeard is the premier image of the seafaring pirate.
Escaped psychopath who terrorised the Spanish coast. No vessel was safe from his attacks. It would have been even worse if he'd had a ship.
Not strictly a Pirate but he was obsessed wiv huntin Wales so he be my sworn enemy. I think he was from Nantucket so he be handy for yer limerics.
Captain of the Pequod, the Mysterious Captain Ahab was combination of Macbeth, Job, and Milton's Satan, Melville named the character after the Israelite king who worshiped the pagan sun god Baal. Ahab reveals to the crew that the purpose of the voyage is to hunt and kill the snow-white sperm whale, known as Moby-Dick, that had cost Ahab his leg on a previous voyage.
Ahab has nailed a goldpiece to the mast and offers it as a reward to the first man who sights the creature. Starbuck (his descendants moved to Chicago to found a well known chain of coffee shops), the first mate, tries to dissuade Ahab from the quest. The novel culminates when Moby-Dick charges the boat which sinks. Ahab is drowned, tied by the harpoon line to his arch enemy.
In his end Ahab takes his crew with him. The only survivor is the narrator, who is rescued by a passing ship. Some think that Ahab was actually Captain Cronan.
Legendary Pirate who's very name strikes fear into the heart of men. Born...no man knows...but most likely Hell itself!
Little is known of Cronan's whereabouts although he does call in at The Admiral Benbow for a bottle of Old Nick on foggy nights.
A few years ago, we be sailin round the Cape o' Good Hope, when one o' me officers sed this be where the legendary Cap'n Cronan were last sighted.
The story be that Cronan's ship met with disaster a few weeks after 'ee had buried 'is treasure worth several million pounds. No-one knew where the hidden treasure lay.
Later that evenin'after a few grogs, me first mate said that perhaps we should 'old a seance, an see if we could contact the spirit of Cap'n Cronan.
We all sat round the table in me cabin. We put the letters o' the alphabet in a circle, an put "Ahoy", "Belay", an "Arrr" in there too. Then we turned down the lights an all placed our hooks on the upturned grog tankard in the middle o' the table.
I'd had enough by this time. I remembers tellin' Cronan 'ee were lucky that people couldn't be killed twice, an I'd come lookin' fer the bastid when me time came.
The only man whom Captain Flint ever feared, Long John Silver was a Bristol man who served in the Royal Navy and lost his leg under "the immortal Admiral Hawke. Taken on as cook for the Hispaniola's expedition to Treasure Island, Silver leads the crew in a mutiny. Silver is one of only two former members of Captain Flint's crew to get his hands on a portion of the treasure (Benn Gun is the other).
Long John Silver had a parrot called Captain Flint in honour of his former captain. He also had an African wife back home in Bristol.
Promoted through the ranks at the tender age of 5 years before the mast (but mostly in thee bilge), his singin was feared accross the seven seas of Rye Vitta. After studying diligently at the Portsmouth Pirate Public School Nef Yoo bunked off to join Black Bart's ship the Big Brenda at Portsmouth docks.
Half an hour later Black Bart had Nef Yoo thrown over board but fortunately for Nef Yoo the tide was out an he landed in a picnic basket belonging to Auntie Blackbeard. The rest is history with lots o lollipops thrown in. Grand Admiral Nef Yoo Blackbeard is the scourge of paddling pools the world over.

Giga-byte is showing a new device on their website with the status ‘Coming Soon’. This is Linux-based MID (Mobile Internet Device) with a qwerty keyboard, Including an Esc key!!
So finally, it’s possible to ssh to a linux box and vim from almost anywhere on the planet (as long as there is Wifi, GPRS or UMTS/HSDPA).
This is really a very neat device. It’s a bit bigger than the average smartphone, but still small enough to be very portable. (15,2 x 8 x 2,25 cm, 340g). It has a intel atom chip running at 800Mhz, 512MByte of memory and a 4GByte SSD for storage. The screen is a 4.8 inch touchscreen LCD display with 800×480 pixels. The device supports bluetooth (2.0), wifi (802.11b/g) and HSDPA UMTS and has an integrated GPS receiver. Besides a mini-usb port to connect it to for example you linux workstation, it also has a usb host port, to connect an external harddisk, usb webcam, scanner, printer, anything (as long as the software supports it). And ofcourse, If you slide the MID open, you will get a blacklight keyboard, with an ESC button.
The MID does not support voice calls, but maybe voip calls over umts will work also… Some sites mention that the linux OS is Ubuntu Mobile and that looks very good and usable. Ubuntu mobile comes with a browser based on Firefox 3, and open office. So what else do you need?
I’ve been using Mythtv for about 4 years now. And the motherboard is showing some failures now and then (rebooting in stead of shutdown), the disks are a bit full and playback of hdtv is not smooth.
An argument against giving placebo drugs to children during clinical trials Coursework Service fxtermpaperqpsw.blogdasilvana.info
6 clinical trials in children vincent yeung ethics and recruitment issues evidence-based medicine and healthcare are the pillar of optimal medical care. For safety reasons, many clinical trials of drugs are designed to exclude women of childbearing age, pregnant women, or women who become pregnant during the study in some cases, the male partners of these women are also excluded or required to take birth control measures.

Clinical trials involving new drugs are commonly classified into four phases each phase of the drug approval process is treated as a separate clinical trial the drug-development process will normally proceed through all four phases over many years.
The unpredictable 'placebo effect' also negates economic arguments that are typically made in favor of placebo-controlled trials, namely, that it requires fewer participants and is faster compared to trials that compare two or more treatments (eg, active controlled or superiority or non-inferiority trials) (7.

A placebo has no therapeutic value and therefore is perfect in clinical trials as a control substance that can be compared with a drug being tested to judge its effectiveness if patients who take a placebo experience improvement in their condition, that is called a placebo effect.
In all such conditions, non-inferiority clinical trials should be performed, where a new treatment is compared head-to-head with a standard treatment (rather than a placebo.

This option is less likely to work out for those with bad credit because traditional lenders have limits on who they will finance. That said, it isn’t impossible. Your interest rate will however be higher than a standard rate and more collateral will probably be required of you than a traditional recipient. If you think you may still qualify, take a look at some of the loan options offered by the SBA.

For existing franchises looking for working capital, another form of alternative financing comes from monetizing the franchise’s balance sheet to obtain funding. Using the franchise’s commercial real estate, or by tapping into the franchise owner’s personal real estate, an asset based lender can collateralize the real estate and provide working capital up to 90% of the real estate’s equity.
You’re applying for a business loan, and you may even be organized as a corporation or LLC. However, lenders will almost always want to hold you personally responsible for the loan. If they don’t do that and the business fails, there’s nobody left to repay them. But if you make a personal guarantee on the loan (which is likely a requirement), they can go after you personally, and your personal credit will suffer if you don’t repay.
Small business term loans. Term loans are typically for a set dollar amount (e.g., $250,000) and are used for business operations, capital expenditures, or expansion. Interest is paid monthly and the principal is usually repayable within 6 months to 3 years (which can be amortized over the term of the loan or have a balloon payment at the end). Term loans can be secured or unsecured, and the interest can be variable or fixed. They are good for small businesses that need capital for growth or for large, onetime expenditures.
Real estate investment is a great business. However, the SBA will not guarantee loans for business that do what they consider speculation. Unfortunately, real estate investment is considered speculation. We may be able to get you a non SBA business line of credit up to 150K. If you are interested, please fill out our pre-qualification form and we will schedule a call to go over your options. https://keycommercialcapital.com/prequalify/
So what’s the catch? You must have an eligible retirement account (Roth IRAs are not eligible, but most tax-deferred retirement plans are), and generally speaking, you should have at least $50K in the account to rollover. This means that ROBS are often not an option for young franchisees who haven’t had sufficient time to save money in a retirement account. In addition, there is a risk to doing a ROBS. If the franchise fails, you could lose your retirement funds.
Alternative business lenders are comprising a growing part of the financing industry as bank loans become increasingly hard to get. Franchise owners benefit from alternative franchise loans, which have less-strict borrower qualifications than traditional business or SBA loans, and also put the funds in your account a lot faster. Generally, alternative loans have higher rates than bank loans, but they represent an important source of capital to many small business owners, including franchise owners, who would not otherwise qualify for financing. Moreover, some of the best online lenders offer rates that are on par with big banks.
If you are a person with no credit rating, you will need to establish one before you will be able to get a small business loan. Basically, you establish a credit rating by buying things on credit and paying back the money you owe. Your loan repayment history plays a big part in establishing your credit rating, but all your "credit" dealings make up the history that's used to determine your credit rating.
To become an officially recognized business entity, you must register with the government. Corporations will need an "articles of incorporation" document, which includes your business name, business purpose, corporate structure, stock details and other information about your company. Otherwise, you will just need to register your business name, which can be your legal name, a fictitious "Doing Business As" name (if you are the sole proprietor), or the name you've come up with for your company. You may also want to take steps to trademark your business name for extra legal protection.
“For many individuals, funding a business may involve taking on significant business or personal debt. With most loans, you would need to start making payments right away. This makes it difficult for your business to grow in its early stages, when you’re trying to build revenue and generate profits. With ROBS funding, you avoid having principal or interest payments, which can greatly impede your cash flow, especially in the early years of business. Using retirement funds can also help your business reach profitability faster. And because you’re investing your own money in your own business, there’s no need to provide collateral, like your personal home.”
Microlenders are nonprofits that typically lend short-term loans of less than $35,000. The APR on these loans is typically higher than that of bank loans. The application may require a detailed business plan and financial statements, as well as a description of what the loan will be used for, making it a lengthy process. Also, the size of the loans is, by definition, “micro.” But these loans may work well for smaller companies or startups that can’t qualify for traditional bank loans, due to a limited operating history, poor personal credit or a lack of collateral.

To get a good estimate of costs, the first thing we recommend doing is asking the franchisor for their Franchise Disclosure Document (FDD) early on in the process. It’s a good idea to have an accountant and lawyer review the FDD with you before you sign any paperwork or hand over any money. A franchisor is legally required to give you the FDD at least 14 days before you buy a franchise.
Bank of America can work with you to design a special lending program to help you grow and better manage your business. This alliance enables us to provide customized financing solutions, based on a thorough understanding of your particular business model. Plus, you’ll have access to an underwriter who understands your business. We offer a variety of program options including:
A very economical service is Regus, with office locations worldwide; office space is readily available for startup entrepreneurs on a just-in-time basis. Regus offers several membership levels: Blue, Gold, Platinum, and Platinum Plus. For example, a Regus Blue membership card is free, while a Regus Gold membership card costs $59 per month (with the first month free). With a Gold card you get shared space, Internet connection, and telephone access at Regus locations worldwide, 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.
It turns out, he thought the process of starting a business was really complicated. "I don't want to go through all that stuff," he said, "unless I'm absolutely sure my idea is perfect." Like a lot of would-be entrepreneurs, he was stalling because he was intimidated by the apparent complexity of the administrative and legal tasks involved in starting a business.
If you have all of the answers above, and are still unsure of what to do then we suggest working with your franchisor to find the best option for your new business. This can be the best place to start when searching for franchise financing, because they’re very experienced with where other franchises like yours have gotten their financing from.The franchisor also has a vested interest in you being able to purchase the franchise and will often provide some kind of help.
SCORE.org conducted research in 2015 that studied business growth in the United States between 1997 and 2014. They found a 67.8 percent increase in the number of women-owned businesses, compared with a 34.4 percent increase in men-owned businesses. The study also found a huge growth in the number of businesses run by women of color, up an incredible 215.7 percent, with revenues increasing by 193 percent. Latino-run small businesses also saw a massive increase, with small business ownership growing at a rate of double the national average.
Online lenders: While you may lack collateral, run a new business and need money quickly, you may find that an online lender is your best option. In general, online lenders should be a “last resort.” The average APR for online loans can be as high as 108 percent, making it difficult for small businesses to pay the money off before the debt balloons.
Though the fastest growing entrepreneurs were entering this business model are Millennials. Franchising at a rate that cannot be ignored; the latest Census data shows that 66% of Millennials are interested in entrepreneurship, nearly making up 30% of all entrepreneurs are between 20-24 years old, and over 25% are self-employed. Additionally, they launch 160,000 start-ups each month motivating the IFA (International Franchise Association) to start the NextGen Franchise initiative that recognizes and supports young entrepreneurs.  The IFA is going as far as reaching out to this generation while their still in school, introducing them to the benefits and possibilities of franchising offered through education, scholarship, and leadership. Another age group making up a large part of the market are the baby boomers and seniors. More services being developed are quality of life/wellness products, patient advocacy, non-medical home care, and respite care. And lastly, there are an increase in businesses interested in kids and child enrichment that is thriving and showing no signs of slowing down. Each has displayed an interest in getting kids moving, reading, thinking, and believing in themselves. These businesses have provided a sense of accomplishment and community within a supportive environment. Therefore, a trend of development centered around fitness, sports, music, art, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math), tutoring, and child care have grown immensely. However, with the trends centering around technology, the food industry, and the distinct influence of individual age groups, franchising is proving to be a flourishing industry with a positive future.

And at first/ the comments were like --/ basically like,/ "Oh my/ God,/ that's the mall/ from my childhood.//

It was kind of always hard/ to get into the ones/ that were abandoned,/ but I somehow always found a way in.//

A Succession of Bad Days has been out for an unfamiliar critical read, and now another unfamiliar critical read (the people who one gets to bounce up and down and burble at about the gubbins of the world building are invaluable, but they're also not going to tell you where you've been incomprehensible quite the same way a new reader will), and ought to be winging its way to the editing processes relatively soon-like.
All these really complimentary reviews, James' included, attend on selling less than two hundred copies.
That's darn near splendid for an obscure ebook; it's not the sort of thing that leads to a traditional publisher seeking me out, offer in hand. (And indeed remarks from people who work in traditional publishing about my fiction summarize as "this <complimentary adjective> book would never sell".)
Printing it myself would certainly be substantially more of a financial loss than the ebook version.
So I'm not seeing a paper version as likely any time soon. I can dream about some subsequent ebook selling so well that a publisher wants to go back and put the whole Commonweal in print, but that's maybe more hallucinatory than hopeful as dreams go.
I discovered this book by seeing an interesting series of comments you wrote on a history blog, going "is that the same guy who comments on that other blog?", doing a bit of Googling, finding that you wrote a book, and navigating a new and somewhat odd way of buying an ebook.
Given that it took me quite a bit more Googling to find my way back here to see if there was a sequel coming out, I think 200 copies is pretty darn good indeed. ;-)
Also, the book is great. The last time I was so wonderfully confused was when i read Neuromancer for the first time.
(I finally have a theory about what Blossom used to [redacted] -- did you perhaps take advantage of a trip through the "Things I Won't Use" blog, and happen on a writeup of chlorine trifluoride...?)
You're correct about "Things I Won't Work With", although only one of the things Blossom used was chlorine trifluoride. The other one was between three and five litres of cryogenic FOOF.
(There's a whole sorcerer subtext there about being able to control high energy chemistry -- generally any high energy molecules, the mischief gets into it and abrupt, unexpected, and bad things happen; if you can make it work you're powerful -- that the Captain missed completely. So that was also Blossom thumbing their nose at Rust as well as expressing a very uncomplimentary opinion of the guy on the wall.)
The good thing -- no leaves to get in the way. The bad thing -- few birds. Did get to see some tremendously shiny white-crowned and white-throated sparrows and a plethora of ducks, but nothing much in the way of shorebirds at Hillman. (Those came through the next day, as may be required by law.)
Grebes, with their ancientry, mad eyes, mutual sexual selection, and propellor feet are one of my favourite bird groups. There were a bunch very close to the tip, so there are not-horrible photos from my little pocket camera, too. I don't know what they were feeding on but they were diving for it a lot.
No idea what these are or if it's an actual wildflower rather than a garden escapee from Pelee's thickly settled past. But there were a lot of them and they're pretty.
Those could well be violets. My botany generally suffices to conclude that some plant is, or is not, a tree, and little further.

Similar to the FD-10. The middle one is like a mini-330; the one with the big pickguard has the pickups included in it, with 4-adjusting screws, spring-mounted into the body for a pickup adjustment. A sick idea, where you adjust the pickguard rather than the pickups.
This book is written is such a manner that reveals how the true character of our Loving Father is NOT a murderer - yet how the seed of deception/murder is in our hearts. For those who honestly struggle with the language of the Old testament in light of the gentle and loving nature of Jesus who provided this statement of clarity: "If you have seen me, you have seen the Father" - this book is a MUST read! The perspective revealed completely destroys the prevailing errors that are sounded throughout Christian pulpits today. There is a huge blessing to be found. PERFECT Love casts out all fear, and with the 'time of trouble' just before us, we need to cast out all fear.
What can I say? Those audio's have so moved me that I am still reduced to a quivering mass of tears even as I write---the result of a recognition reflex, I suppose, a spoken word experience one might say.

Catching up with old friends, you want to know what theyve been up to, not marvel at how much theyve changed. And so its with warm familiarity that Harrison Ford, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg return to the serial adventure story, and character, that has defined their careers, and we find Mr. Jones charming, albeit missing a quick step or two, and game for more swashbuckling archeological adventure.
The reunion comes with a few new surprises (an alien subplot thats right in Spielbergs wheelhouse), the return of some old surprises (welcome back, Raiders maiden Karen Allen, too bad we dont have too much for you to do) and a sort-of reboot on a torch passing that might have occurred 20 years ago, when Last Crusade gave us our most recent glimpse of Indiana adventure.
Shia LaBeouf (motorcycle rebel Mutt Williams) gets a Marlon Brando-esque intro as he prepares for the fedora-and-whip handoff that seems all but inevitable now. Jones, in Fords sexagenarian body, somehow still fits the retro vibe the series has always maintained, even as greasers and communists replace Nazis  were not in Egypt anymore but the South American jungle has just as many snakes.
Propelled forward on good-hearted enthusiasm, Crystal Skull is quick enough to gloss over stupid gags (gopher jokes belong in Caddyshack) and plot points both absurd (alien conspiracy) and impossible (involving a lead-lined refrigerator). At this reunion, its easy to forgive a few wrinkles and slower steps just to revel in the fact that no one got major plastic surgery or turned into an irredeemable jerk.
If Indiana Jones seems a shade familiar, well, old friends would just seem creepy and weird otherwise. (Paramount)

New Zealand must be a pretty small place because if you start tracing musical family trees, the same names come up again and again. Take Robert Scott, for instance. As part of both the Clean and the Bats, his place in Antipodean musical history is assured, but he continues to make interesting new music after more than 25 years. His latest solo effort is a bit of a departure from his previous work. Songs of Otagos Past is a collection of traditional New Zealand folk songs from around 100 years ago. This has obviously been a labour of love for Scott and despite the inaccessibility of the project it is hard not to be pulled in by these tales of working class struggles, outlaws and immigrant life. Unfortunately the sincerity of the delivery and the sparseness of the arrangements make it hard to sit through, but isnt that always the way with things that are good for you? Scott also appears on Sea Tulip, the new album from Gina Rocco and the Rockettes, so I guess that would make him a Rockette. He plays bass, sings a little and co-produced the record, although this is very much Ginas show. Her jangly guitar songs would probably get blown away by the wind if it wasnt for the band adding some weight to the proceedings. It stops her from being just another female singer-songwriter, but the most interesting songs on the CD are those that are more experimental and dont have her singing at all. (Suburban Noize)

The idea for this dress came from this one which I spied on Pinterest. I wanted to do a big bow. So I made one, tucked it into a pleat and then cheater smocked the rest. Here are some directions on how to do the smocking. Really easy and awesome. The part I always forget is to stretch or not stretch the elastic thread as you're winding bobbin. Not stretch! Then spritz with water or stream and it'll shrink up like magic.
Beautiful! It turned out much better than the inspiration. Wish I had a pattern for this one. I can’t figure out how you did the pleat. Is the fabric vintage or new? If it’s new would you share who makes it? I’m in love!

(M) Cooldown description reads: "Se rafraîchi à: aujourd'hui 21:00" => why? is it thirsty? ;-) "Réinitialisation: Aujourd'hui 21:00". => "Rafraîchi" is correct, it's the French translation in the IT field ( I know, it's sounds weird but yes, it's definitely correct in French...) but I would not say "Se rafraîchi" but only "Rafraîchi".
(M) Button "Refresh" still in English => "Réinitialiser" / "Renouveler" => "Rafraîchir" is also correct.

The Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship gave those who want to sponsor their parents or grandparents an early holiday present by announcing that the sponsorship program will open for registration on 2 January 2018.
In 2017 Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (“IRCC”) introduced a new “lottery” system to select applicants to fill its quota of 10,000 applications. In 2017 more than 95,000 people registered with IRCC. This year, the system will work in a similar manner and starting on Tuesday 2 January 2018, if you want to sponsor your parents or grandparents you can register your interest by submitting the “Interest to Sponsor” form online.
The 2018 registration process will have one important difference: the registration process will ask more questions to ensure you actually meet the key eligibility requirements before completing the registration process. So what are the eligibility requirements? In order to be eligible to sponsor your parent or grandparent you must meet the following minimum requirements:
sign an undertaking promising to provide for the basic requirements of the person you are sponsoring for a period of 20 years;
sign an agreement with the person you are sponsoring that confirms that each of you understands your mutual obligations and responsibilities; and
prove that you have sufficient income to provide the basic requirements for your family members in Canada as well as the persons included in your sponsorship undertaking.
The key requirement is the minimum necessary income you must show to support your sponsorship application. In order to meet this income requirement, you can combine your income and that of a co-signer for the past three years. The co-signer can be your spouse or common-law partner. The co-signer must also be eligible to sponsor and co-sign the undertaking of support for the period of 20 years.
The amount of income you must have depends on the size of your family and the number of people you are sponsoring. For example, if you are a family of three sponsoring both your mother and father, you (along with a potential co-signer) need to show income of at least $64,791 in 2014, $65,377 in 2015 and $66,654 in 2016 (the income figures for 2017 have not been announced yet). This amount varies based on the number of people in your family and those being sponsored. Your income over the three year period is verified based on proof of income from the Canada Revenue Agency.
There are a number of factors that prevent you from being able to sponsor such as if you are in receipt of social assistance (for any reason other than disability) or you are in default of a previous sponsorship undertaking, an immigration loan or family support payments. If you meet the eligibility requirements and are able to register your interest, here are some important tips to help you to sponsor your loved ones:
Review your tax filings and gather your Notice of Assessments for the last three years. If you have a co-signer, gather and review their documents as well. If your income (combined with your co-signer) is sufficient you can register online.
Consider that your co-signer has to agree to be part of your application until the permanent residence visa is issued for your parents or grandparents. If you believe that there is any reason why you may lose the support of your co-signer you should carefully consider whether you meet the eligibility requirements by yourself.
If you register yourself or use the services of an authorized representative (immigration lawyer or licenced immigration consultant) you should make sure to hold onto the registration code that is generated and check the email address you provide for the application process. There may be more than one selection round so you should keep your registration code safe to be able to check if there are subsequent rounds of selection.
If you are chosen to submit a sponsorship application you have a short period of time (likely 90 days) to submit your complete application including all original signed forms and supporting documents. Therefore you should be ready and able to compile the required documents for yourself and your parents very quickly.
And even if you sign up by yourself, make sure you do not lose your winning lottery ticket. IRCC is known to return applications that are missing a single signature or document. In order to be successful you have to submit a perfect sponsorship application either by yourself or with the assistance of an experienced lawyer. Good luck!

I liked this poll, since it was real fun to listen the tracks. I expected people working with samples from vintage movies but these tracks are full of originality.
rozzers!, that's just the way i think a cop show theme should sound! all it needed was an outrageous hendrix-esque guitar solo
Anyone up for a "guess the synth" challenge here? The upside here is someone may eventually tell you if you're correct. That said, I don't think my ear is honed enough to make accurate guesses, but it's fun to hear from people who can.
I enjoyed the whole listening. 'Law and Disorder', 'The Night Shift' and 'The Erotic Couch' are some of the best in my opinion, but my vote went to 'Detective'.
I wish I hadn't overlooked this challenge. I wrote a song several years ago titled Blood on the Wall, yet almost everyone I know literally referred to it as the "cop show theme."
I gotta go with "Night Shift" as well. Challenger was great, but not very Cop-ish. "Night Shift" has a real theme feel to it. I would use it for my cop show if I had one.
Can't get The Night Shift tune out of my head, it seems like it's always been there. Spot on, cheers!!
Some really fantastic tracks here but "The Erotic Couch" really nails it for me - I'm not quite sure why but it sure has a great vibe. As a result it gets my vote.
I don't mind being pale during winter and fall, but when the sun comes out and temperatures start rising I like being a bit more tan. But since I'm naturally pretty pale and don't tan very easily, plus who can be bothered to sunbath for hours or ruin their skin under a tanning bed.
I had previously used tanning products by Garnier and Dove, but as I didn't use them that often I didn't really like spending a lot of money on them. So when I saw Primark their tanning range I took a leap of faith and bought some. Honestly, I was a bit fearful, what if I turned out like some orange Oompa loompa.
Luckily I didn't turn out orange, and this is already the third bottle off fake-tan I have from them. I've also never had any issues with it streaking or applying patchy. Overall it's a great range for its price.
This is their gradual tan so you need to apply it a few time if you want a darker effect, and if I'm honest if you want a really dark tan this is not the product for you. I'm not sure if they have a darker one, I know they used to have them but the range changed last year (I think, I'm not sure since I don't pay any attention to fake tanning stuff in winter).

It is true you would say 'rafraîchir' when you talk about reloading or reseting an Internet page - but for a shop's stock it doesn't sound right. So I would rather stick with "Se renouvelle: aujourd'hui à xx:xx"
Actually, this is a good point. The first mission says "Vos Héros et vous" so, on the one hand "vous" might only concern the player and is singular, but on the other hand, chapter 4 mission 3 says: "Avancez prudemment, vous êtes suivis" as if "vous' refered to the whole group, so plural...

So turned 18 today, at 1 in the morning when i was extremely tired i had an amazing game in the Maus, 1v5 Victory with 9.5k damage and 8 kills. then just now i decided to try my luck with some boxes, bought about 25, got T26E5 and Type 59. Although now i have T26E5 and T26E5 P but i think thats a good thing as now i can 3 mark the non skinned
Is it coincidence that this happens on my Birthday after shitty luck all the time in boxes? I dont think so! So thank you Wargaming for remembering <3 :3
Good on you tho, congratulations on your birthday! You're an adult now, may you have a fun & great future ahead of you!
As a token I'll raise my Carlsberg and send you some birthday wishes, now that you reminded me that I got one I'll also drink it, thanks.
http://wotreplays.eu...d-xx984-type_59 if anyone wants to watch, Good game but nothing amazing like 1v15 10k damage or whatever.
Should i sell the second T26E5? already have T26E5 P which i bought and 3 marked. Not sure if i should grind it on this one or just get 2 mill for free

Lately I've been very lucky to have a wee run of great custom orders which means I have been spending a lot of time online chatting to lovely folks about their gorgeous ideas (more on them another day, so much to show) which hasn't left much room for blogging... as you might have noticed from my sparse posts around here!?
Since I decided to reorganise a bunch of my Pinterest boards to sort them by colour (after being inspired by Golly Bard's boards) I just can't get enough! Really, I can't tell you how satisfying it is to pin by colour and fulfil that instinctive human need to pigeonhole everything. I so wish I had done this sooner!
Anyhoo, the point of this post (yeah, we'll get there in the end!) is that by sorting by colour can throw up some entirely random but beautiful and inspirational combinations of images. Pinspiration at it's best I think and what better way to bookmark a few of my most favourites than to blog them here? I just can't stop admiring these two images at the moment, aren't they stunning!?
ps ~ I was going to call this post 'A perfect pair of pins (no not my legs that's for sure!)...' but changed my mind, maybe I should have kept it!?
Oh no, 'Pinspiration' is a fabulous title for your blog, Emma and sounds like so much fun. I've just discovered Pininterest (better late than never right?) and can't wait to have a go myself. My craft blogging and on-line store is so new and your blog and your blog is so 'pinspirational!'
Hi Emma, there;s been lots of talk about Pinterest and copyright, this week. Did you know that pinning images gives the company behind Pinterest, the right to use them for profit should they wish? I didn;t read the small print! I blogged about it this week, so did knitsofacto and there are other links in our posts if you want more info. Just sharing in case you hadn't heard... :)

I'm in the process of moving at the moment. My internet service will have to be transferred, and I'm not sure how long that will take. Hopefully it won't be much more than a couple of days. I'll try to respond to any questions or comments if I have free time at work, but I won't be uploading any new material until my internet service is back again.
In the meantime, please leave a comment and recommend me some artists/bands to check out, or leave me some feedback on the recent modifications I've made to the blog, or suggestions for improvements or new features.
This album is currently out of print and not available on CD, so I suggest you get this while you can.
Redd Kross was the brainchild of Steve and Jeff McDonald, brothers from the Los Angeles suburb of Hawthorne (also home of the Beach Boys) who began playing music together before either had hit puberty. Fueled by a series of dubious visits to famed area rock clubs like the Roxy and the Whiskey-a-Go-Go, they formed their first band, the Tourists, in 1978; Jeff, then 15, handled vocal duties while Steve, 11, took up the bass.
After rounding out the group with schoolmates Greg Hetson on guitar and Ron Reyes on drums, the Tourists played their first gig, opening for Black Flag. Following a name change to Red Cross, they issued their self-titled EP debut in 1980. After the departure of Hetson and Reyes (for the Circle Jerks and Black Flag, respectively), the McDonalds enlisted a revolving line-up of underground musicians for their full-length follow-up, 1981's Born Innocent, which found the group's pop-culture obsessions bubbling over on tributes like "Linda Blair" and "Charlie" (about Charles Manson, whose "Cease to Exist" they also covered).
Following the album's release, the band was threatened with a lawsuit from the real International Red Cross; as a result, they became Redd Kross, and returned in 1984 with Teen Babes from Monsanto. Ex-Black Flag singer Dez Cadena had already come and gone through Redd Kross by the time Geza X produced the seven-song Teen Babes From Monsanto. Running strictly on wicked irreverence, the McDonalds and drummer Dave Peterson turn the spotlight on various musical victims, and the Redd Kross living jukebox bangs out loud and convincing covers of Kiss ("Deuce"), the Stones ("Citadel"), Stooges ("Ann"), Bowie ("Savior Machine") and others, leaving "Linda Blair 1984" the sole original. A record of the ultimate bratty garage band in its element. (Year of Release: 1984)
Since I've uploaded hundreds of albums, and filled many requests, I thought it would be fair to create a wishlist for albums that I would like to have. The great thing about the music blog community is that we are able to obtain almost anything regardless of how scarce it may be. The albums below are on the list either because I couldn't find them, or I'm short on time and need a place to list them so I don't forget to check them out later. I have also listed albums which were requested by visitors that I have been unable or haven't had the time to find. Thanks in advance to those of you who are able to fill these requests for me. So without further ado.. here's my wishlist:
I've made another modification to the blog which I believe will help you to find what you are looking for. If you look to the sidebar on the right, directly underneath my profile, you will see the option to 'Show Table of Contents'. Clicking it will reveal a list of all the posts that I have made in alphabetical order. They can also be sorted by the date they were posted. I've noticed that this modification increases page load time; specifically the time it takes for the portion of the sidbar beneath the Table Of Contents to display. It was more apparent on Opera than Firefox, but it wasn't significant enough to be a problem for me. I haven't tested it on Internet Explorer yet. If you notice that page times are extremely slow, please leave a comment and let me know.
This modication was made possible thanks to Beautiful Beta. Please give me some feedback about this addition.
As some of you may know I had a graphic design contest for Digital Meltd0wn recently. The winner, a talented guy by the name of Fill, came up with a wonderful banner and button set. If you would like to show your support for the blogroll you can do so by displaying this button on your website/blog. There are also a great selection of banners to choose from which were submitted by the participants of the graphic design contest which can be found here. Thank you for your support.
Note: I'm not sure why, but a box is showing up around the button. This has something to do with the blogger layout that I've chosen, and is not part of the image. This box will not appear on your website. In order to view what the image will look like simply right click on the button and select 'open image'.
Part of the Chicago underground scene of the late '80s and early '90s, Tar played a fierce blend of abrasive noise rock and post-hardcore punk, drawing from local touchstones like Big Black and Naked Raygun. However, they were also influenced by vintage punk bands like the Sex Pistols and the Stooges. As they evolved, they were often compared to more metallic noisemakers like Helmet and the Jesus Lizard. Tar's thick, heavy guitar textures and pitch-dark dissonance were an accurate reflection of their moniker, and their disdain for accessibility or major-label exposure was just as accurate a reflection of the scene from which they'd arisen.
In 1988 the group landed a deal with Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles imprint. Tar made their proper debut with the 1989 EP Handsome, half of which was engineered by Steve Albini; they followed it with another 7", "Flow Plow" b/w "Hand." Tar's first-ever full-length appeared in 1990 in the form of Roundhouse, which was produced by Albini and found the band growing more assured in its style. Bassist Mescher left the band in early 1991 and was replaced by Tom Zaluckyj. The "Solution 8" single followed, as did their second album, Jackson, which again boasted assistance from Albini and showed Mohr developing into a stronger vocalist. Tar subsequently departed Amphetamine Reptile in favor of Touch & Go, making their debut with the 1992 single "Teetering"; a split 7" with Dischord emo heroes Jawbox followed hot on its heels. 1993's Clincher EP flirted with the grungy side of electric Neil Young, a trend that continued on the full-length Toast, which appeared later that year.
The band toured the U.S. and Europe in support of Toast, and the latter leg of the tour went poorly. Deciding that they were no longer enjoying themselves as they once had, Tar agreed to go their separate ways after one more album. Over and Out was released in 1995 and was widely acclaimed as the high point of their career, thanks to its greater variety. In the wake of Tar's dissolution, Zaluckyj and Greenlees reteamed in Luckyj, which never released a record. Greenlees also played in Ex-Chittle with former Dis- member Rob Sieracki. Meanwhile, Zaluckyj played with the B-52's' Fred Schneider for a brief period, and also worked as an engineer at Albini's studio.
Bo Diddley aka "The Originator", is often cited as a key figure in the transition of blues into rock and roll, by introducing more insistent, driving rhythms and a hard edged guitar sound. He was born Ellas Otha Bates in McComb, Mississippi, and was adopted and raised by his mother's cousin, Gussie McDaniel. He took her surname, becoming Ellas McDaniel. The family moved to Chicago when he was seven. He took violin lessons as a youth, but was given a guitar by his sister and was inspired to become a guitarist by seeing John Lee Hooker.
He worked as a carpenter and mechanic, but also began a musical career playing on street corners with friends, including Jerome Green (c.1934-1973), as a band called the Hipsters (later the Langley Avenue Jive Cats). In 1951 he landed a regular spot at the 708 Club on Chicago's South Side with a repertoire influenced by Louis Jordan, John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters. He adopted the stage name Bo Diddley, which is probably a southern black slang phrase meaning "nothing at all", as in "he ain't bo diddley". Another source says it was his nickname as a teenage Golden Gloves boxer. The nickname is also linked to the diddley bow, a one-stringed instrument used in the south by mainly black musicians in the fields.
In late 1954, he teamed up with harmonica player Billy Boy Arnold, drummer Clifton James and bass player Roosevelt Jackson, and recorded demos of "I'm A Man" and "Bo Diddley". Re-recorded at Chess Studios with a backing ensemble comprising Otis Spann (piano), Lester Davenport (harmonica), Frank Kirkland (drums) and Jerome Green (maracas), and released in March 1955, the a-side, "Bo Diddley", became an R&B # 1 hit. In 1958 his debut album entitled 'Bo Diddley' was released on the Chess label in 1958. It is a compilation of his singles since 1955. It collects several of his most influential and enduring songs. - Wikipedia
Black Mountain is one of two circulating incarnations of Vancouver musician Stephen McBean—the other being the more solo oriented Pink Mountaintops. Releasing self-titled, debut albums within six months of each other, these Mountain-family bands have given nostalgic rock 'n' roll fans reason to rise. And hell, even if your record collection doesn't consist of battered vinyl copies of late '60's and early '70's drug-fueled, heavy hitters, you won't be able to resist the gritty grooves of both bands. But, this is a Black Mountain review, so on with the show.
Black Mountain opens the curtain with the first of many assertive anthems. The caustic "Modern Music" declares "One, two, three another pop explosion / One, two, three another hit recording / Four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten." – A jab at the state of modern music that makes no bones about it, and I likey. Like much of the album, it's adorned with loud guitar, screechy sax, and some killer Keith Moon/John Bonham style drumming. And if you aren't already familiar with Pink Mountaintops and their superb duet "Tourist in Your Town," you get your first taste of the soulful singing of Amber Webber who takes center stage later on "Heart of Snow."
Following the opiate groove of "Druganaut," "No Satisfaction" sounds like a sunshine alarm after the two previous shadowy efforts. Recalling the Vaselines and VU, "No Satisfaction" showcases more of McBean's cool and Webber's raw soul. The album continues with more blues, prog, and psychedelic rock detailing the sub-genres' highlights with a new and exciting perspective. Citing the Rolling Stones, Velvet Underground, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd among others, Black Mountain somehow succeed in keeping it fresh all along.
Someone requested this several months ago, but I was only able to find it recently. It proved extremely difficult to track down, and I couldn't find out any information about the album, other than it contains 26 tracks of rare psychedelic music from the 60's. If any of you find out more info about this release, please leave a comment.
In the strange Olympic summer of 1972, the Dusseldorf instrumental group German Oak entered the Luftschutzbunker, or Air Raid Shelter, in order to record their eponymous first LP. A free form rock band founded by a small community of 5 German hippies / "avant garde" artists back at the beginning of the 70's. Their self title effort was recorded in a WWII air raid bunker. The cover of their self title album (a militaristic image which is a portrait of the third Reich military force) provides an illustration of anger expressed by the WWII’s young generation against their parents. By consequence German Oak's music is very tortured, dark and weird, dominated by heavy, "distorted" guitar solos & rhythms. The background creates "painful" & "ambient" sequences thanks to delay echoes, electronic "fuzzy" noises & repetitive bass lines. A funkadelic/jazzy felt punctuates with discretion this grandiose, "creepy" instrumental album. A first CD reissue was offered by Witch And Warlock in 1991. Today this album is re-edited by Radioactive records (2005). In a rather discretion they also released the moody, cloudy and experimental epic-kraut "Niebenlungenieg"
Following in the footsteps of the percussive and organic Organisation and the remarkable Dom, German Oak had every reason to believe that this 3rd LP to be recorded by a Dusseldorf band would be warmly received. Unfortunately, German Oak were not only wrong in their assumptions that locals would embrace their music, but even local record shops rejected all the group's attempts to sell the albums in city outlets. Such was their lack of success that 202 of the original 213 copies were stored in the basement of the group's organist until the mid-1980s, when a thirst for undiscovered Krautrock finally brought German Oak back from the dead.
I've tried to put together a comprehensive list of freeware music programs. If you know of anything that you think should be added to the list please leave a comment. I would like to thank the members of the Neowin community for contributing many of the programs on this list.
I've decided to start sharing other music related resources here. The main focus of this blog will always be to share all the wonderful music blogs available on the internet, but I would also like expand on that idea, and make it a great place for all things music. Next, I plan to make a list of freeware music software. If you have any ideas on music resources that I could add please leave a comment.
I'm sure I'm not the only one who is sick of Rapidshare's dominance of file uploading. There are plenty of great alternatives out there, but unfortunately they are overlooked by many. In my opinion the best sites are those which distribute files to several upload sites. These are known as file distribution sites. If you know of any that aren't on this list, please leave a comment, and I will add it. If you know of a friend or site that you frequent which is guilty of using rapidshare, please point them in this direction. Hopefully we can break people from using rapidshare.
As I said in my previous post, choosing the winner for this contest was very difficult for me. There were several entries that were my favorite throughout the contest, and I even ended up changing my mind at the last minute. Entries 1, 4, and 14 were my personal favorites, and I think any one of them would have looked great if they had been chosen as the winner. Someone left a comment saying that most of the entries looked too digital and not enough rock & roll. I would have to agree with that statement. A lot of the entries looked too clean and professional, which would have been great for a computer tech site, but I just didn't think it would be fitting of a music blog. There were banners that might have fit better with the overall design better, but in the end I had to go with entry #1 by Fill from Russia. I was captivated by his work from the very beginning, and I knew as soon as I saw it that the other participants would be hard-pressed to best him. His entry stood out to me as being the most original and artistic, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Entry #4 was a very close second, and I considered making it the winner several times, and had I not changed my mind at the last minute it would have been the winner. To everyone who participated in this contest.. I can't thank you enough for your hard work. There were many great entries, which made my decision difficult. I would also like to thank Sir Real Films and Trinity Comics for sponsoring this contest, and donating such a generous prize package. It wouldn't have been possible without them. Please visit their websites, located below, and help support two wonderful independent companies. I've added the winning banner to the header of the blog, however I'm having a little trouble out of blogger with the placement of the image. I'll try to get that fixed within the next couple of days.
Stand! is the pinnacle of Sly & the Family Stone's early work, a record that represents a culmination of the group's musical vision and accomplishment. Life hinted at this record's boundless enthusiasm and blurred stylistic boundaries, yet everything simply gels here, resulting in no separation between the astounding funk, effervescent irresistible melodies, psychedelicized guitars, and deep rhythms. Add to this a sharpened sense of pop songcraft, elastic band interplay, and a flowering of Sly's social consciousness, and the result is utterly stunning. Yes, the jams ("Don't Call Me Nigger, Whitey," "Sex Machine") wind up meandering ever so slightly, but they're surrounded by utter brilliance, from the rousing call to arms of "Stand!" to the unification anthem "Everyday People" to the unstoppable "I Want to Take You Higher." All of it sounds like the Family Stone, thanks not just to the communal lead vocals but to the brilliant interplay, but each track is distinct, emphasizing a different side of their musical personality. As a result, Stand! winds up infectious and informative, invigorating and thought-provoking -- stimulating in every sense of the word. Few records of its time touched it, and Sly topped it only by offering its opposite the next time out.
I've finally decided on a winner for the graphic design contest. It was a tough decision, and I would like to thank everyone who participated in the contest. There were a lot of great entries, and I appreciate the work that you all did for the contest, but unfortunately there can be only one winner, and you all will find out who that is tomorrow.
As some of you may already know, I recently had to take a break to deal with some personal issues that I was going through. Life is much better at the moment, so I'm able to devote time to Digital Meltd0wn once again. Once again, I would like to apologize to those who entered the banner contest. Unfortunately, the circumstances that prevented me from being online happened around the deadline of the contest. Here have a few important announcements regarding the contest and other random blog news.
Graphic Design Contest: Once again I would like to apologize to those of you who entered the graphic design contest. I am currently in the process of adding the late entries to the Flickr account. Once that is finished the only thing left for me to do is to preview how each of the banners would look on the blog if they were chosen as the winner.
last.fm account deleted: Unfortunately last.fm deleted my account a few days ago. They sent me a warning once before for displaying the url to this blog on my profile. I promptly removed the url from my profile. I can think of only one reason they would have for deleting my account. Earlier this week one of my friends on there asked me if I know where to find any albums by a band called Pond. I posted the url to a blog that I ran across which was sharing a couple of their albums. My account was deleted without warning a few days after that. Because of this the Digital Meltd0wn group I created on last.fm has a vacated leader position. I suppose I'll leave it as is, rather than create a new group. I created a new account, so if you were my friend on there before, please re-add me. Here is the url to my profile: http://last.fm/user/zer0_ii
Once I've chosen a banner for the blog, I plan to create an introductory post. This post will basically be an introduction/site map that I think will make the blog more user friendly and navigable. I also plan on creating two posts; one for requesting an album, and the other for requesting a re-upload of any album that was previously uploaded, but has since been deleted.
The Digital Meltd0wn Music Blogroll is coming along well. Traffic has been steadily increasing. When I first started it, I was the one asking for permission to include other's blogs on the list. Now a lot of fellow music bloggers are requesting to be put on the list. It's especially nice to see bloggers, from the blogs that I've admired for a long time, visit the site and leave comments. Even if don't run a music blog, and you know of some blogs that you think are worthy of the list, please leave a comment some time and tell me about them.
I've been considering adding a cbox http://cbox.ws to the blog. I've already added one to the blogroll, but it doesn't receive nearly as much traffic as this blog, and I haven't received any positive or negative opinions about it. Please let me know whether you think this is a good or bad idea.
First off, there's a lot of history to this EP. First, it appeared as 5 song EP on vinyl. Then it appeared on the "Initium" CD with an extra track. Then it appeared as the second half of the "Final Descent" album. Now, its back on its own. Another thing to note is that when "Unholy Passion" first game out, it featured Damien on guitar, but somewhere along the way Danzig, as he'd also done with some unrealeased Misfits' material, re-recorded the guitar parts himself (it was rumored that this was done to avoid paying Damien royalties) and I know that this was the version that originally appeared on "Final Descent" and that's also the version that appears here. So you're not really getting the original "Unholy Passion".
Secondly, this contains the 3 best songs Samhain ever recorded, those being "Unholy Passion", "The Hungry End", and "I Am Misery". "All Hell" (an updated version of the Misfits' "All Hell Breaks Loose") and "Moribund" are also good tunes. If you're not familiar Samhain's sound, the best description is sort of mid-tempo punk-goth-hard rock cross that takes its evil much more seriously than the Misfits ever did (but that doesn't mean you have to). And if you wonder why I keep mentioning the Misfits its because Samhain was Glenn Danzig's first post-Misfits project (but chances are you already know that).
There two lowpoints to this release. One is the so-called "bonus track", "Misery's Tomb", which is just the backing vocal and bass tracks of "I Am Misery". Pretty dull. You'll probably only listen to it intentionally once. Then there's the production. Like all Samhain releases, the production was pretty weak. The guitars are mixed too low and the vocals sound sort of muffled. Still, the songs, for the most part, are excellent so they make up for most of the album's weaknesses.
For anyone who thought they knew Sam Cooke's music based on the hit singles, this disc will be a revelation. This is the real Sam Cooke, doing a sweaty, raspy soulful set at the Harlem Square Club in North Miami, FL, on Jan. 12, 1963, backed by King Curtis and his band, a handful of local musicians, and Cooke's resident sidemen, guitarist Clifford White and drummer Albert "June" Gardner. To put it simply, it's one of the greatest soul records ever cut by anybody, outshining James Brown's first live album from the Apollo Theater and easily outclassing Jackie Wilson's live record from the Copa. Cooke's pop style is far removed from the proceedings here, which have the feel of being virtually a secular sermon. The record opens with the frantic, desperate chant-like "Feel It," followed by a version of "Chain Gang" that has all of the gentling influences of the single's string accompaniment stripped from it -- Cooke's slightly hoarse voice only adds to the startling change in the song, transformed from a piece of pop-soul into an in-your-face ode to freedom and release. "Cupid," perhaps the most sweetly textured song that Cooke cut during the 1960s, gets the full soul treatment, with horns and Curtis' sax up front and Cooke imparting an urgency here that's only implied in the studio rendition. "Twistin' the Night Away" gets two hot King Curtis sax solos, the highlights of a pounding, rippling performance with a beautifully vamped extended ending (with the drums, bass, and White's guitar wrapping themselves ever tighter around the central riff) that never would have made it to the floor of the Copa. "Somebody Have Mercy" leads into a long vamp by Cooke, a brief, soaring quotation from "You Send Me" that could easily have been a high point in sheer intensity -- and then Cooke and the band crank the tension and the spirits several notches higher with the greatest version of "Bring It On Home to Me" ever done by anybody. It all ends with a version of "Having a Party" that manages to be both soothing and wrenching at the same time, Cooke luxuriating in every nuance as the crowd joins in singing, reaching a higher pitch to the gently swinging tune, the drums kicking in harder, the rhythm guitar rising up, and Curtis' sax and the horns rising up slowly while Cooke goes on with his singing, which is more like preaching and the group sounds like it could play the riff all night. It's one of the cruel ironies of the recording business that this unique and extraordinary concert recording went unreleased for almost 22 years, in favor of the more polished (but also more antiseptic and duller) Sam Cooke at the Copa.
Official release of this rare South African hard rock album from 1971 that contains wild heavy guitars and screaming vocals
that is on par with any UK underground rock act from that period. Excellent cover versions of 'Into the Fire' Deep Purple,
'War Pigs' Sabbath and an extended 10 minute version of 'Season of the Witch' which is mind frying. Excellent booklet
detailing the history of this wild rock group. This is heavy 70's rock with a real attitude and deserves your attention.
CD reissue taken from the original master tapes. The loudest, most controversial and obnoxious revolutionary
1970 is stuff the legends are made of! "Time to Suck" is all howling guitars! Including covers of "Black Sabbath",
I have experienced a bit of tragedy in my life. It's not something I feel like going into detail about right now, but let's just say that someone very close to me is in a lot of pain and trouble. I apologize to those who entered the banner contest, but I am going to have to decide on a winner when I am in a better state of mind, and I will make that announcement as soon as the time comes. I'm not officially extending the deadline because I don't know the exact date that I will announce the winner, but if any of you would like to submit an entry until that time comes, feel free to do so and I will consider it an official entry.
I would appreciate it if those of you who are reading this would give your opinions on the banners that have already been submitted to the contest. Here is the flickr account which hosts all the entries that have been submitted to the contest so far: http://flickr.com/photos/digitalmeltd0wn You are the visitors to this blog, and I would like to know which banner you would like to see each time you visit this site.
I hope that you will be patient and understanding as I go through this difficult time in my life, and I will be back to normal soon.

Transcription work from home jobs involve listening to audio files and typing out what you hear. While some types of transcription (such as medical) require training, it is possible to break into general transcription with little to no past experience. Before you start digging through the companies below, you may want to read this post about what general transcription involves and this post about the equipment transcribers use.
If you’ve got experience and expertise in a specific area of business, there are hundreds if not thousands of business owners who would love to jump on a phone call and pick your brain. This can be an easy way to make extra money online and to hone your skills to use in your consulting or freelance business.

Internet marketing, or online marketing, refers to advertising and marketing efforts that use the Web and email to drive direct sales via electronic commerce, in addition to sales leads from websites or emails. Internet marketing and online advertising efforts are typically used in conjunction with traditional types of advertising such as radio, television, newspapers and magazines.
Promote products that are stepping stones to products you will create in the future. This is a bit more advanced, but is a great way to think ahead. Amy Porterfield suggests thinking about the first thing your followers will need in order to get started with what you provide. For example, I teach people how to blog, so the first thing they need to start a blog is hosting. That’s why I am an affiliate for hosting.
Become an Amazon Associate and then use Keyword planner to find an in-demand niche: With more than a million different products to choose from and up to 10% commission the sales you drive, Amazon’s affiliate program is a great place to get started. Browse their available products and see what connects with you. Or take it a step further and use Google’s Keyword Planner to quickly check how many people are searching for a specific term. With affiliate marketing, the more relevant traffic you can pull in, the more you’ll make off your site.
Just one subscriber and something to say, that’s it! Don’t wait to have a “large list”. Email Marketing has no limits in size, BIG or small. When it comes to using a tool like Benchmark, the last thing you want is to have to learn something new. That’s why Benchmark Email was created with familiar tools in mind. Here is how and what you will need to get started
Whether you already have a list of subscribers or are starting from scratch, email marketing services can help. All of the services we cover let you add contacts manually using copy and paste or by uploading CSV or Microsoft Excel files. Some integrate with third-party software enabling you to import Gmail and other webmail contacts, Salesforce.com and other customer relationship management (CRM) data, or other software where you might have contacts stored. Depending on the size and location of your list, third-party integration could be key. Verify whether you can export contacts as well (and how easy it is to do so) should you leave the service. Managing users who unsubscribe should also be easy so you're not accidentally contacting anyone who has opted out of your newsletters.
Digital marketing's development since the 1990s and 2000s has changed the way brands and businesses use technology for marketing.[2] As digital platforms are increasingly incorporated into marketing plans and everyday life,[3] and as people use digital devices instead of visiting physical shops,[4][5] digital marketing campaigns are becoming more prevalent and efficient.
Game advertising - In-Game advertising is defined as "inclusion of products or brands within a digital game."[50] The game allows brands or products to place ads within their game, either in a subtle manner or in the form of an advertisement banner. There are many factors that exist in whether brands are successful in their advertising of their brand/product, these being: Type of game, technical platform, 3-D and 4-D technology, game genre, congruity of brand and game, prominence of advertising within the game. Individual factors consist of attitudes towards placement advertisements, game involvement, product involvement, flow or entertainment. The attitude towards the advertising also takes into account not only the message shown but also the attitude towards the game. Dependent of how enjoyable the game is will determine how the brand is perceived, meaning if the game isn’t very enjoyable the consumer may subconsciously have a negative attitude towards the brand/product being advertised. In terms of Integrated Marketing Communication "integration of advertising in digital games into the general advertising, communication, and marketing strategy of the firm"[50] is an important as it results in a more clarity about the brand/product and creates a larger overall effect.
There are plenty of guides to marketing. From textbooks to online video tutorials, you can really take your pick. But, we felt that there was something missing — a guide that really starts at the beginning to equip already-intelligent professionals with a healthy balance of strategic and tactical advice. The Beginner’s Guide to Online Marketing closes that gap.
I've been doing affiliate marketing – successfully – for well over a decade. While I earn affiliate income from this website, I've made the bulk of my affiliate revenue from selling real users products and services – in multiple niches - that have nothing to do with the making money online niche. I've been nominated as Affiliate of the Year three times in the Affiliate Summit Pinnacle Awards – taking home the award in 2016. I've spent the last decade+ teaching people how to find success with affiliate marketing - based on my own experiences - as well as advocating for the industry as a whole. I'm often blunt and can sometimes be controversial, but I'm also 100% bullshit free.
Web design is a very technical field that requires high literacy in many different kinds of software, including image editing and website architecture programs. A designer should be comfortable with computer “languages” like HTML and stay up to date on new technological developments. The designer is also an artist, so he or she should also have a firm grasp on aesthetics, visual continuity, and image composition.
A key benefit of using online channels for marketing a business or product is the ability to measure the impact of any given channel, as well as how visitors acquired through different channels interact with a website or landing page experience. Of the visitors that convert into paying customers, further analysis can be done to determine which channels are most effective at acquiring valuable customers.
So be wary. Ensure that you learn from the pros and don't get sucked into every offer that you see. Follow the reputable people online. It's easy to distinguish those that fill you with hype and those that are actually out there for your benefit. Look to add value along the way and you'll succeed. You might find it frustrating at the outset. Everyone does. But massive amounts of income await those that stick it out and see things through.
Emails triggered by milestones, like anniversaries and birthdays, are fun to get -- who doesn't like to celebrate a special occasion? The beauty of anniversary emails, in particular, is that they don't require subscribers to input any extra data, and they can work for a variety of senders. Plus, the timeframe can be modified based on the business model.
Spam is the biggest threat to organic search engines, whose goal is to provide quality search results for keywords or phrases entered by their users. Google's PageRank algorithm update ("BigDaddy") in February 2006—the final stage of Google's major update ("Jagger") that began in mid-summer 2005—specifically targeted spamdexing with great success. This update thus enabled Google to remove a large amount of mostly computer-generated duplicate content from its index.[29]
As digital marketing continues to grow and develop, brands take great advantage of using technology and the Internet as a successful way to communicate with its clients and allows them to increase the reach of who they can interact with and how they go about doing so,.[2] There are however disadvantages that are not commonly looked into due to how much a business relies on it. It is important for marketers to take into consideration both advantages and disadvantages of digital marketing when considering their marketing strategy and business goals.
For the most part, the 6-figure, 7-figure, and 8-figure-earners and up are making a large majority of their income by scaling out offers that they control. If you're just starting out, that avenue isn't for you. It only comes over time as you come to understand the field. As Sharpe says, most people first need to get a lay of the land and cruise through the virtual sales landscape before they dive into a massive undertaking like creating their own digital products and sales funnels.
Choose your niche and check for demand: The golden course combination is when you can find an in-demand niche that aligns with your skills and unique experiences. A great way to do this is to use Google Trends and Google’s Keyword Planner to look for average monthly search volume for keywords related to your proposed course content. Are people actively looking for high-quality information about this subject? Of course, if you’re already creating content for a blog, coaching service, or a site like Medium, you can test demand this way for free just like Bryan did.

While the practice of child sex tourism can erode the moral integrity of our nation, the greatest victims are of course, the defenceless children, their voices unheard, their stories untold, their plight implacable, and their innocence stolen. They must endure the immediate and long-term emotional, psychological, and physical impact of sexual exploitation. To make matters even worse, in areas with limited educational opportunities, people are ill-informed of the health risks and the severe long-term psychological harm that is inflicted on children who are sexually exploited. Perhaps even more disturbing, however, is the nature of how many of these children are forced into the sex trades although the family is traditionally a child’s first line of defence, in some cases children are sold into the sex trade by someone they know and trust
Child-sex tourism is commonly defined as the “sexual exploitation of children by a person or persons who travel from their home district, home geographical region, or home country in order to have sexual contact with children”. Travelling to exploit children does not necessarily imply crossing into another country, because domestic travellers can also sexually exploit children in their own country
The full extent of child sex tourism and exploitation in Sri Lanka has been difficult to document because of its covert nature. We have not conducted any in-depth research on the subject during the past decade and, therefore, studies conducted long ago cannot be used as a true indicator of the situation now. Nobody will deny that we have an issue of child sex tourism but to what extent its prevalent is anybody’s guess. Naturally, children’s rights activists are saying that a comprehensive research is long overdue.
The commercial sexual exploitation of children is possible largely because of economic disparities. But weak laws and corrupt law enforcement also allow for the trade to flourish. While other factors such as globalisation and new communications technology promote an unregulated industry and exchange which advises on meeting grounds for predators stalking children.
The development of the tourist industry is also another reason for rapid growth in the commercial sexual exploitation of children. Yet, the tourism industry itself is not the main cause of child exploitation but its nature provides all the necessary factors, such as erosion of traditional values and socio-cultural norms, opportunities to earn a quick “buck,” exposure to nudity, relationships between adults and children/men and women and increased demand for sex services from domestic and foreign tourists.
Child sex tourism is also very much linked to the prostitution of children, trafficking of children and the production of child pornography.
The negative impact of commercial sexual exploitation of children is profound and often permanent. For those who survive, it may cause irreparable damage to their physical and mental health. Child victims are inadequately protected because of loopholes in legislation and a lack of law enforcement. They are often treated as criminals and left with little recourse other than to re-enter a vicious cycle of abuse and exploitation, which escalates the risk to their very existence. Although it may be tempting to place the blame mainly on parents as socially irresponsible or children themselves as sexually irresponsible, no sector of society can escape responsibility for the sexual exploitation of children.
So, what really can be done? Tackling the issue of child-sex tourism is not the responsibility of a single sector or stakeholder. In fact, many different actors must join hands in order to construct an effective front line against child-sex tourism. Travel and accommodation service providers can play a direct role towards preventing child-sex tourism. Non-governmental organisations and child-rights agencies that focus on children’s rights, welfare and safety must by definition be actively involved in the fight against child-sex tourism. Government, whose primary function is to ensure the well-being of citizens, must be actively involved as well.
It is time all these organisations meet together at one focal point and share each one’s knowledge, experiences and successful models in the prevention of commercial sexual exploitation of children and adolescents in the context of travel and tourism. Such a meeting can offer a unique opportunity to –by means of presentations and group work– analyse the role that the travel and tourism sector may play in the struggle against commercial sexual exploitation of children and adolescents.
The final result of the meeting will be, on the one hand, a draft plan of action against the commercial sexual exploitation of children in the tourism sector, and on the other hand, a Code of Conduct for the Prevention of Sexual Exploitation in Tourism in our country to be adopted by all stake holders.
Given that the purpose of tourism is to contribute to economic, social and human development, the framework of this plan of action and the Code of Conduct will bring awareness raising and education while the training activities can be carried out at regional and national levels in the tourism sector. Eventually, this will allow Sri Lanka to present itself to the world as an attractive tourism destination that protects its cultural heritage, the environment, and most importantly, the dignity of children and adolescents of our country.
A classic example how we should move forward with Code of Conduct comes from ECPAT International (End Child Prostitution, Child Pornography and Trafficking of Children for Sexual Purposes). This is a global network of civil society organisations exclusively dedicated to ending the commercial sexual exploitation of children. The organisation drew up a Code of Conduct for the Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel and Tourism, and invited companies to become incorporated into its ethical policy guidelines. Initially, the code was directed solely towards tour operators but subsequently extended to the entire tourism sector with the goal of including travel agencies, hotels, and airline companies.
The specific objectives of the Code of Conduct are: (a) to establish an ethical policy regarding the commercial sexual exploitation of children; (b) to train personnel in the country of origin and travel destinations; (c) to provide information to travellers by means of catalogues, brochures, in-flight films, ticket-slips, home pages, etc.; (d) to provide information to local “key persons” at the destinations; and (e) to annually report on progress being made.
The signatory companies to the Code of Conduct also commit to include a clause in all contracts with suppliers and clients, stating a common repudiation of commercial sexual exploitation of children and adolescents. The inclusion of this clause has become generalised to virtually all contracts that are currently being signed by tour operators in Europe and almost all operators in South East Asia.
Several best practices are identified on how to protect children against sexual exploitation in tourism in a multi-stakeholder setting.
The Government must work with professionals to create new training modules. Involving industry partners in developing training modules creates involvement and commitment and makes the training modules more effective.
Youth conferences and rallies could be organised in which youth talked to entrepreneurs and tourists about their peers who are less fortunate, and they can help distributing information materials. Such participation of youth result in positive reactions and a high visibility of the awareness raising materials
The cooperation with local governments can lead to much additional support. The local government authorities can invite professionals to participate in presentations and trainings to their members. They can also open hot lines to report sexual exploitation of children.
The strong presence of law enforcement representatives in the trainings will give participants more confidence that there is willingness from authorities to tackle the problem and this motivated them to report cases in the future.
Since children are often lured outside the tourism industry, it is advisable to invite many other sectors to the seminars conducted. The trainings of fruit vendors, craft market workers and taxi drivers will lead to a high awareness amongst tourism entrepreneurs throughout the chain. Most of these small-scale entrepreneurs have direct contact with tourists and work at places where children are recruited for sex tourism.
We must give very much more attention for community involvement. This is important to break the silence around sexual exploitation of children and to inform children and parents about signals of traffickers, consequences of sexual exploitation, how to prevent and report it and where to find support. Community involvement is also important to create efficient pressure on local government and the tourism industry to take child protection measures.
Educational seminars for post-secondary students in schools is an effective way to change the attitude of the next generation of tourism professionals towards sexual exploitation of children in tourism.
While the practice of child sex tourism can erode the moral integrity of our nation, the greatest victims are of course, the defenceless children, their voices unheard, their stories untold, their plight implacable, and their innocence stolen. They must endure the immediate and long-term emotional, psychological, and physical impact of sexual exploitation.
To make matters even worse, in areas with limited educational opportunities, people are ill-informed of the health risks and the severe long-term psychological harm that is inflicted on children who are sexually exploited. Perhaps even more disturbing, however, is the nature of how many of these children are forced into the sex trades although the family is traditionally a child’s first line of defence, in some cases children are sold into the sex trade by someone they know and trust.

We imagine you may have questions at this point! Here are a few questions we hear a lot with regard to our keynote speakers:
It depends on which speaker you’d like at your event, the location, presentation length, etc. but you can expect that it will cost anywhere between $5,000 to $20,000 + travel expenses.
This is a question we get asked often. Our keynote speakers are skilled at delivering content in a 45-60 minute time frame and the content they cover is best suited for groups over 100. Our training tends to be catered to an individual group’s needs and a trainer can spend anywhere from two hours to two days working closely with that group on-site and in the following weeks, months and years (we’re fans of long-term relationships, can you tell?) If that sounds like a good fit, check out more information on our training!

Geography comments: "at the Fazenda Formosa... a private property located 7.5 km from the town of Campo Formoso in the region of Chapada Diamantina... The local altitude ranges from 400 to 800 m asl" and the fragment is 100 ha
Habitat comments: "the climate in the region is classified as sub-humid tropical, with annual precipitation of 302 mm to 1, 935 mm, with a marked rainy season from March to August" and the site is in "arboreal Caatinga" and is "secondary forest in an advanced stage of succession, with a canopy of 5 to 12 m in height, and surrounded by pasture"
Sampling comments: "Specimens were monthly collected from May, 2009 to April, 2010. Three sampling sites were established in each fragment with a distance of at least 200 m from the nearest edge in order to minimize the edge effects... and at least 400 m from each other. Each of the nine sites was monitored between 07:00 and 17:00 hours on a single day monthly, with a total sampling effort of 1, 080 h. A passive collecting method (trapping) was employed using six types of artificial fragrance as baits-eucalyptol, eugenol, vanillin, methyl salicylate, benzyl acetate, and β- ionone. Eighteen traps were set at each fragment, from a height of 1.5 m above the ground. The traps were made with 2-l plastic soda bottles with three short, inverted funnels inside. A pendulum with a swab of cotton wool soaked in fragrance was fixed in the cap of the basal bottle"

Location: Where the road takes me now i have stopped fighting my inner feelings, we are on the same side now,
Whatever happened to your prediction (made in September) that the influx of migrants would slow down, and the borders would all soon be open again?
According to the unbiased free Press, more fences and check points are being erected, than are being dismantled.
The EEC is crumbling, and will collapse under the strain of having to put up with too many migrants.
For your information all ex pats living abroad are entitled to vote. They just have to register online and then follow the simple steps.
Things will settle when idiots stop shooting at each other. Going to take a bit longer is all and its not being helped by the Ruscies and Americans ( who by the way are not taking refugees either )
Frau Merkel and the buffoons running the EEC have made a massive mistake in letting all the migrants flood in.
They have supposedly left their own countries for a better life, but want to carry on with their own traditions in our countries.
European women being raped and sexually assaulted in their own cities, and you think this is acceptable?
According to one of the Immams, the German women who were assaulted asked for it by wearing revealing clothing and wearing perfume !!
Even Greece is being threatened with having the Schengen line moved so that they will be left to cope on their own.
Turkey has been given billions of Euros to stop the boat people arriving into Greece, but they have done nothing to curb them. Only the winter weather has slowed them down, not the authorities.
If you want to live in a place that is struggling to cope with the initial influx of people, thats fine.
But by that stage there will be no United Kingdom Scots and the Welsh will become separate entities and join the EU. Just as Southern Ireland have and there is the possibility of the north joining the south to remain in the EU.
England will continue its downward slide and become a haven for Muslims and others. Let's be honest, English are a minority already in most of the major cities and towns, , do you really think they will all leave and stop claiming whatever they can just because the country is not in the EU ?.
I am not saying I like what is happening or what is going to happen in the future whether the UK is in the EU or not but I am trying to rationalise things from the " big picture " rather than from the prospective the people are being fed in the UK. It could happen this way.
Personally I would like the UK to remain in and continue with the changes that are being sought rather than see the country continue on its downward spiral. Yes things are happening with refugees and other problems that most Brits are not aware of but it will improve even if it has to get worse before it gets better.
BigAl wrote: But by that stage there will be no United Kingdom Scots and the Welsh will become separate entities and join the EU. Just as Southern Ireland have and there is the possibility of the north joining the south to remain in the EU.
Not one country who is part of the UK is wealthy enough to join the EEC as a standalone country and take on the Euro, which is what they would have to do because the Pound is the GB Pound.
Southern Ireland doesn't come into the equasion, as they were not part of the UK when we joined the EEC.
England will not continue its "downward spiral" as you call it, by continuing to take in more muslims etc as you claim, because we will have NO ONE telling us we have to share the influx of millions, like the rest of the EEC countries.
Our borders can remain closed to undesireables, as our own government will be making the laws, which cannot be over ruled by your firends in Brussels.
I would love to know how you can see things getting better in mainland Europe, when they continue to let in millions of refugees, who are assaulting western people, and you accept that it ok until its starts to get better. It will not get better.... The muslims will STILL maintain that the woman is a second class citizen, who should be seen and not heard, and covered from head to toes when they go out.
When their Imam said that the girls who were raped in Germany and Sweden, were asking for it because they wore skimpy tclothing and WORE PERFUME.
They want a better life in Europe, but still want to do things their way, and will NEVER conform to the western way of life.
Your friend Frau Merkel is going to end up bankrupting some of the poorer member countries with her debt consolidation plans, and some will be forced to leave the Euro and go back to their own currencies.
The EEC is in a deep crisis, and allowing all these millions of migrants in, with a totally different culture, is doomed to failure.
No business in the EEC (well certainly in the UK) would be allowed to get away with this, they would be hauled before the courts and given a massive fine for none compliance with the law, but you find it acceptable. Why?
I suspect that you will be like the rest of the ex-pats who live in Europe, who will come scurrying home to the safe haven of the UK when all the 20 million Turks get their free passes into Europe in a few years time.
I was right in my predictions when I argued with your ideas 6 months ago, and things have only got worse.
As soon as the weather gets warmer, the migrants will start swarming into the Greek Islands again by boat. The EEC has threatened to move the Schengen border so that Greece is on the outside of Europe if they don't tighten their borders.
The EEC should be sending some help to the Greek Islands to assist in returning the refugees, but instead Frau Merkel thinks its a better idea to give Turkey millions of Euros and the offer of a visa, if they try to curb the influx.
Watch some proper, independent news channels Al, and see what the world REALLY thinks of how Europe is being controlled by the freaks in power.
I had to have a good rant today, as I am going on holiday now , and I thought I would give you something to think about whilst I am away !!
Working for a large global company I have for the last two weeks been working alongside colleagues from Vilnius in Lithuania and Sofia in Bulgaria who have been over on a visit. All are graduates who speak English fluently as well as a number of other languages such as French and Spanish
In a few weeks times some of us will be revisiting them at their offices to see for ourselves the European dream
We currently have the highest number of people in jobs , and the benefits issues is being addressed so what is their problem?
Thousands of UK residents live and work in Europe and anyone can do the same as we have freedom of movement and no work restrictions
I have dual nationality, English / German and Spanish residentia. I read and write in 5 languages and speak another 4 passably. Why would I think about returning to the UK ? I pop over now and again to see family but that's about as far as my interest goes there .
Another thought though is what happens if the millions of ex-pats in Europe have to return to the UK ?. Where will they all be housed ? The NHS is struggling now without more pensioners to look after. And this will be on top of the immigrants that are going to end up there. Methinks the country may have a problem especially as Scotland has already said in parliament that they will have another referendum with a view to splitting from England and remaining in the EU. ( this has been reported on a lot of countries news channels ) as it happened live on TV.
Preserving and protecting a rare strain of corn. I was reading the following article and how the Potawatomie and Ojibwe Indian Tribes nearly lost their rare strain of corn and other foods. I think to help honor both Tribes the rare corn seeds should be purchased and used to make mash out of for whiskey. Twenty percent of the corn seeds from the first crop would then be returned to help ensure the Tribes seed library is kept full as we as creating a rare whiskey blend.

Johannesburg - The outbreak of listeriosis has been traced to an Enterprise Foods facility in Polokwane, Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced on Sunday.
"We can now conclude scientifically that the source of the present outbreak is the Enterprise Food production facility located in Polokwane," he said at the offices of the National Institute of Communicable Diseases (NICD) in Johannesburg.
Listeria has been traced to another Enterprise facility in Germiston on the East Rand, and a Rainbow chicken facility in the Free State, but further tests were needed as the sequence type was not yet known.
The National Consumer Commission has issued safety recall notices to those manufacturers and facilities, and the companies are now responsible for coming up with the recall plan.
The plan must be sufficient to cover their entire distribution chain, and the facilities will also have to resource and pay for the implementation.
Motsoaledi said several children presented with gastroenteritis in Soweto earlier in the week. Tests were done, and it was found that they had listeriosis. The strain they were affected with, which was the same for the larger outbreak, was traced to Enterprise's Polokwane facility.
Motsoaledi said statistics on March 2 show that the outbreak has claimed about 180 lives and 948 laboratory-confirmed cases had been reported to the NICD.
He said while polony was a definite source, other products such as Viennas, Russians, Frankfurters, other sausages and cold meats not typically cooked could also be affected due to the risk of cross-contamination.
Pregnant women, neonates, elderly people and anyone with weakened systems should "not go near" these products.
Motsoaledi said retailers must clean their fridges, meat slicers, and either remove the ready-to-eat meat products or place them in plastic bags in separate fridges - ahead of the recall.
"I’ve already emptied [out] my fridge this morning… I woke up my wife – [and told let’s] just take these things out," he said. "Any human being in the country who has these products in their fridge must take them out immediately."
Listeria is a bacterium that is naturally found in the environment - it commonly occurs in soil, water, vegetation and in the faeces of some animals. It can contaminate a wide variety of food types, including meat and meat products, dairy products (unpasteurised and pasteurised), fresh and frozen produce (fruits, vegetables and sprouts) and ready-to-eat products.
A total of 945 cases have been reported since 1 January 2017, with 30 additional cases recorded since the last update (20 February 2018).
Outcome at the end of hospitalisation is known for an additional 18 cases, bringing the total with known outcome to 635/945 (67%) patients. 176 (19%) patients are known to have died.
At present, the source of the outbreak is not known, although progress is being made in each area of the investigations listed below.
The public are advised that processed, ready-to-eat meat products, soft cheeses, and unpasteurised milk and dairy products should be avoided by persons who are at risk of listeriosis. In addition, processed, ready-to-eat meat products include viennas, polonies, russians, ham, other ‘cold’ meats, sausages, various corned meats, salami, pepperoni and similar products typically found in the processed meat sections of food retailers and butcheries should be avoided, or thoroughly cooked in boiling water or heated at high temperatures of 70°C or higher before eating.

Domestic demand for beef was up 2.2 per cent in June, but down 1.8 per cent in the first half of 2016. Lacklustre growth in the US economy has left meat demand slightly lower than last year. Overall meat demand was down 1.1 per cent during January-June compared to a year earlier. Export

Let me pull myself from the fetal position and attempt to discuss what occurred in Hannibal Season 3, Episode 2 “Primavera“. The episode begins with THAT MOMENT from the season 2 finale “Mizumono”, where Hannibal Lecter (Mads Mikkelsen) guts Will Graham (Hugh Dancy) and slits the throat of Abigail (Kacey Rohl). Living through this scene was brutal, but add-on the extra sequence of more blood and visual effects so stunning that for a second you forget what you just witnessed. However, it all comes rushing back and before you can have your all the feels moment you see Will in the present recovering in the hospital and being visited by Abigail!!!
Is Abigail alive, is she a figment of Will’s imagination?! Sadly, I’m not 100% sure because with Hannibal you just never know. But if Abigail is acutally alive she might just be the luckiest and unluckiest person in the fictional universe. C’mon, if she is alive she’s had her throat slice TWICE and survived, but she is also a person who has had their throat slit TWICE! Regardless, Will is prompted to go in search for Hannibal and this takes him to Palmero, Italy where he meets up with Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Fortunato Cerlino). Inspector Pazzi has been pursing the killer known as “Il Mostro” and he believes this killer is Dr. Hannibal Lecter. The two combine talents in search for Hannibal and we get a brief moment where we believe that Hannibal and Will, will come face-to-face.
This meeting however didn’t take place and I wonder will Hannibal and Will reunite tonight on Hannibal, Season 3, Episode 3 “Secondo” airing on NBC at 10/9c, directed by Vincenzo Natali. In tonight’s episode, Will continues his search and meets a possible ally:
Will Graham continues his search for Hannibal Lecter, making his way to Hannibal’s childhood home in Lithuania. Once there he meets the mysterious Chiyoh (Tao Okamoto), former attendant to Hannibal’s aunt. Meanwhile, Jack Crawford (Laurence Fishburne) arrives in Italy, hoping to find Will and intervene before tragedy strikes again, and Bedelia (Gillian Anderson) warns Hannibal against unraveling his new life. (via NBC)
Knowing that Will travels to Hannibal’s home as a youth in Aukštaitija, Lithuania is quite exciting. Not only will we get a glimpse into Hannibal Lecter’s passed, but we will get to meet new character Chiyoh, portrayed by Tao Okamoto who starred in The Wolverine and is apart of the upcoming cast of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And as thrilled as I am to see these scenes play out in front of gorgeous landscapes, I am on pins and needles to spend some time with Jack Crawford. Jack is on a mission and I want to see how this will play out.
Now check out the below clip of Will arriving on the grounds of Hannibal Lecter’s former home in Aukštaitija. And remember to join me on Twitter as I live tweet tonight’s episode Hannibal, Season 3, Episode 3 “Secondo” at 10 PM ET.

Michael never knows what to write in these little description areas. Should he say something witty to make people laugh and remember him or does he do something snarky like quoting Hamlet. Well whatever he writes here, it is just only a brief glimpse inside. Make your own choices, you'll stay if you want to.

I was lucky enough to actually meet Diana, once. It was a once-in-a-lifetime moment that was over so fast but to this day, the memory of how I felt feels as vivid as ever. The year was 1983. I had just turned 17 and was in my final year of high school at an all-girls public school. I was a prefect, one of twelve, and all the talk around the traps was the news that Charles, Diana and baby William would visit our little town of Dunedin during their whistlestop tour of New Zealand. This was big. Hardly anyone important came down as far south to visit, so we were pretty excited.
But bigger news was to come. We were left totally gobsmacked a little later by an invitation to attend the opening ceremony of the new wing at our brother high school up the road... with none other than the Prince and Princess of Wales as official guests!! Holy crap! I'm sure you can imagine the level of (noise) excitement that broke out between we teenage girls. In short, we were ECSTATIC.
And so there we were. Standing in the centre of a never-ending sea of male students with a union jack blanket we grabbed from our common room held front and centre. We were giggly. Excited. And desperate for any glimpse of her Royal Highness. Our barely-restrained patience was rewarded as a door opened and out stepped Charles and Diana not more than three metres away! She immediately spied us standing there and much to our absolute delight she exclaimed, "Oh, at last! Some girls!" And walked straight over to meet us. OH MY GOD.
I don't remember much of what we said. My one clear memory is how utterly flawless her complexion was. She was stunning. With eyes that were the most vivid shade of blue. Photos I'd seen hadn't done her justice because in person, she was simply breathtaking. Our photo made the paper the next day and added to the glow we were still basking in after meeting Diana. It was pretty cool being us right then.
Fast forward to August 31st, 1997 and I was at my mother-in-law's house with my family when we heard the unthinkable. I was stunned. Surely there must be some mistake, I thought. I spent the next few days constantly watching the television, in between bouts of crying. OMG, the crying! I cried a river of tears, a whole swollen, bloated river. I cried for my own personal loss, I cried for the senselessness of it all, but most of all I cried for her two young boys. I don't think I will ever forget that haunting image of them walking behind her casket at the funeral. So heartbreaking.
I think she would be very proud of her boys today. What a credit to her (and Charles). They have turned out to be gorgeous, well-adjusted, happy and even, dare I say it, 'normal' young men. Even with the odd naked scandal included. (I daresay she would have had some choice words to say about that, but as every mother of blokes well knows, boys will be boys, so I'm sure he would've been eventually forgiven!)
Wow you met her! How incredible. I was driving out of the Westfield Carpark at Bondi Junction when I heard the toll collector say "no she's dead, they've just announced it" he seemed so sad I thought he was talking about a relative, I paid and looked at him sadly, as I drove off I turned on the radio and realised he was talking about Princess Diana. Met friends for lunch at Coogee Beach and we were all in a bit of a state of shock. It just seemed so incredible, she was so young, the magazine covers seemed less glamorous without her.
We spoke to her for all of thirty seconds or so but I'll never forget it. It was the stuff of dreams, really and, as a consequence, she was always my favourite royal after that. I was in a state of shock when she died, like so many others. The global outpouring of grief over her death was truly something to witness.
New Zealand-born Australian. Mother. Friend. Writer. All Black fan. Red wine lover. Rock chick forever.
There’s 7 of them – what? That’s at least two more than 1D, Take That, The Beatles, Jackson 5, The Bee Gees and ABBA. Do I need to go on?
Born in the Seo District of Daegu, South Korea his parents are farmers. Much of his childhood was spent with his granny (like Justin Bieber).
V attended the Korean Arts High School, followed by Global Cyber University. (note to self, check whether V is actually a cyber man after all)
His main role in BTS is a vocalist (singer to those people who don’t know what a vocalist is, not signer (singer); not violinist, vocalist.
V revealed his talent for songwriting, being co-writer and co-producer of ‘Hold me Tight’, on BTS’ album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 1.
Collaboration became the name of the game, as V’s melody was combined with the original lyrics of band member Jungkook’s (also see further below, not the JungleBook but JungKook) in the song ‘Run’ for the next album The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2. (that’s Part 2, following on from Part 1 – get it get it?)
V’s solo single “Stigma” from the BTS album Wings (which by the way included a bunch of solos by each of them), placed at 26 on the Gaon Music Chart and was huge in the USA hitting number 10 on the Billboard World Digital Singles Chart.
Aspiring to other great vocalists like himself, V has done on his own a cover of Adele’s song ‘Someone Like You’. Like we all have done at some point. It’s very emotional and beautiful. V has a deep beautiful voice. Not just a pretty face then.
Last year, his song ‘4 o’clock’ which features fellow BTS member RM (see below – descendent of REM from 90’s grunge era), was released to celebrate BTS’ fourth anniversary.
Displaying his acting prowess, V performed in a supporting role in KBS2’s historical drama Hwarang: The Poet Warrior Youth. As well as acting in this production, he provided one of the songs for the soundtrack. It was called ‘Even if I Die, It’s You’ and BTS member Jin (see below – not Gin (although now you mention it) helped out.
V is a very sexy man. It is very true because on the list for 100 most handsome faces in 2017 he came in 1st Place. Yes you read that correctly – he is the most handsome man that has ever walked on earth. No one is more handsome than him. He beats Chris gems worth and bustin bieber. And all the other men you can think of. Number one!!! Obvs it’s not even surprising. It was a fan voted affair but I didn’t vote so yeah I didn’t even knew it was happening lol. But obviously other people did know about it. If you don’t believe me look it up it is true. And moreover, Brazilian surgeons have studied Kim Taehyung’s face and said it is so perfect and beautiful they can’t believe he is real and natural. Perfect symmetry. But he is! No surgery! Jungkook took No.13 in the list whereas Jimin (see further below, named after Jiminy Cricket) took No.64 (should have been ranked higher in our opinion). V is hot and yummy it is a scientific fact! He is so pretty like a doll. No.1 taetae bae bae.
His favourite Korean food is called Japchae which is made from potato noodles and he loves Kimchi which is very famous in Korea. It is stewed cabbage but sometimes they use Korean radishes instead.
When he goes to America he loves to eat at a restaurant called Panda Express. They serve American Chinese cuisine.
He likes to bite his nails sometimes. He loves opening his mouth randomly. If he sees something that is cute he touches it. When he misses his mummy he screams: “Eomma!”
Born in Daegu, South Korea in early spring 9th March, in start of 90s (1993 to be precise) so he has just turned 25 years old. Happy Birthday!!!
Suga started to write music and lyrics when he was 13 and to learn about MIDI (fascinating bit of techie kit).
Around this time he performed as an underground rapper called Gloss. This included a song with the hip hop crew D-Town titled “518-062” in commemoration of the Gwangju Uprising. It was just a phase.
He also goes by the pseudonym Agust D – if you look carefully you will see it is Suga spelled backwards plus “DT” which is a reference to his hometown Daegu.
His own first solo mixtape Agust D was released on SoundCloud in 2016. This covered issues such as his struggles with depression and social phobia. It was rated by Fuse TV as one of the top 20 mixtapes of the year. Suga preferred not to release this commercially, describing that as the “feeling of being trapped in some sort of framework.”
“Wine” won the award for best Soul/R&B track of the year at the Melon Music Awards. As well as that Suga got the “Hot Trend Award” for his sleek production technique!
As a member of BTS he’s the most laidback and he has proclaimed his love of sleep. According to his Facebook profile in 2016, his special skills were lying down and he is the worst member in BTS at moving around. Moving is overrated (just watch those Olympic skiers falling down they should have stayed in bed).
When he was in Japan, doing promotional stuff, his stomach felt hurting so he went to toilet because he thought it was diarrhoea but he find out his appendix has burst. From too much lying down, or too much wine with Suran maybe. So he flew (was flown) to Korea to have surgery because in Japan you have to pay money for a surgery and BTS too poor. They didn’t confirm it was appendicitis in Japan coz they don’t have benefit of knowing stuff from BBC Casualty on TV.
Yummy I love him he is the youngest member of BTS heheheh he is yummy I recommend you listen to his solo bit on Wings: ‘you make me ‘begin’!!!!’
Born in late summer 1st September 1997 (he is only 20) in Mandeok-dong, Busan, Buk District, South Korea
When he was a little boy his passion in life was badminton so he wanted to be a badminton player. But when he started high school he listened to a singer called G-Dragon and decided he wanted to be a singer.
Some day in the future he would love to be the owner of a duck meat restaurant or a world famous tattoo artist. What’s stopping you?
He has an older brother called Jeon Jung Hyun (this can’t be right, insufficient genetic variation on name front)
Jungkook’s favourite colours are black, red and white. He reckons the best colours that express hip hop are black and red. He must like ladybirds.
Jungkook’s ideal type (of ladybird) is a human who’s at least 1.68m, a great wife, a skilled chef, intelligent, has pretty pins and she has to be a kind human.
He has done lots of English song covers like Justin Bieber’s songs: 2U and Nothing Like Us. He has a very pretty voice.
Jungkookie covered a Troye Sivan song called “Fools” with RM. I really like it, I recommend anyone that’s reading this, young or old, to go and listen to it.
His favourite food is bread, pork soup rice   , pizza  , sashimi (from Japanese cuisine), sea eel and anything with flour. Yummy.
Jungkook’s mottoes he likes a lot are, “Living without passion is like being dead,” and, “Rather be dead than cool.”
Born in the scary spooky month of October on a even spookier day of 13 in 1995 so he has now had 22 birthdays.
Family is his dad, mum and younger brother named Park JiHyun. I love Jimin he’s sooo cute and yummy. Omg he is so chubby and squishy. Awwwwwhhhh you must check out his lovely singing on Wings ‘caught in a lie’ sounds like Mozart
Jimin’s favourite food is stew kimchi (like V) and pork, chicken    and any type of meat. 數  he’s like my cat!
His nicknames are Princess Jimin, chimchim (which as you know is from Mary Poppins song) and Park Jiminie (he is mainly called this by Suga). Omg. He perfect waaaa waaa!!!
Born in early autumn  September 12, 1994 (same year as Justin Bieber) so RM is 23-years-old and he is from Ilsan-gu, Goyang, South Korea 
So far in his illustrious career, he has created songs with a range of peeps including likes of Wale, Warren G, Gaeko, Krizz Kaliko, MFBTY, and Primary. RM is a major songwriter for BTS and also produces quite a few of them, and by this stage in the game he has over 80 tracks under his belt.
Once upon a time, pre-BTS he was an underground rapper known by the pseudonym Runch Randa. As such he released quite a lot of songs and also co-created a song with Zico, another underground rapper.
As part of the development of super-band BTS, RM trained for years with fellow recruits – underground rapper Min Yoon-gi (Suga) and dancer Jung Ho-seok (J-Hope) to become the rapping core of the BTS sound.
Incidentally RM is quite intelligent. His IQ is 148, having ranked in the top 1.3% of South Korea in the university entrance exams for social studies, language, maths and foreign language. He can speak Japanese and English, and although all members of BTS learned Japanese pre-debut, RM still to this day studies Japanese (what good that did when Suga needed his appendix out). When it comes to religion, he says he is an atheist.
RM has been a busy bee playing with lots of Korean and American rappers and musicians. Back in March 2015, a fabulous song called P.D.D (Please Don’t Die) was released with Warren G (famous American hip hop producer). The video for P.D.D is well awesome with aeroplanes, airports, recording sessions and RM looking cool wearing a mask in LA. I think the song is catchy and shows RM has a lot of attitude.
RM’s own first (and so far only) solo mixtape came out in spring of 2015, reaching the lowly heights of number 48 on Spin‘s “50 Best Hip Hop Albums of 2015”. Oh well better luck next time…
RM collaborated with hip hop team MFBTY for the song “Bucku Bucku” and was in their video. He also appeared in a small part in another MFBTY music video for their song, “Bang Diggy Bang Bang”(방뛰기방방).” as you do with an IQ of 142 or 48 as the case may be.
RM sang alongside Kwon Jin Ah on Primary’s song U for the album ‘2′, back in 2015. It’s a yummy song. I like the voice of the girl Jin Ah. She has a nice voice. Kind of slow but still yummy.
RM joined forces with Marvel for Fantastic Four film’s soundtrack in August 2015 performing in the digital production of “Fantastic” alongside vocalist Mandy Ventrice.
With his budding producer hat on, RM worked with big cheese CEO Bang Shi Hyuk in August 2016 on Homme’s song “Dilemma”. Lovely song! This followed RM’s production work on BTS’ song “Epilogue: Young Forever” and the SoundCloud song “I Know”.
In case you were wondering RM also joined forces with the phenomenal American rapper Wale on a unique socially-motivated song called “Change” in March 2017 – this was released as a free to download along with a brilliant accompanying music video
Just before Christmas 2017 it emerged from social media that RM had performed on the remix of Fall Out Boy’s gritty ditty “Champion” released worldwide across all music streaming sites. It clambered up to number 18 on Billboard’s Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, and catapulted heartthrob RM to number 46 on the Emerging Artists Chart in January 2018.
RM also made history as the first K-pop artist to be on the Rock Digital Songs chart, Champion coming in at number two on the list. So it’s sure worth a listen.
American hip-hop magazine XXL recently issued a list “10 Korean Rappers You Should Know” which RM was on (obvs). Writer Peter A. Berry compares RM to “Pitbull or Flo Rida for those pop vibes,” and assures us, “RM rarely fails to live up to his name.”
He even goes as far as to say he is “one of the region’s most dexterous rappers, capable of switching flows effortlessly as he glides across an array of diverse instrumentals”.
RM recently has undergone a nasal surgery for a deviated septum!!! Ew!!! But he is recovering and he’s getting better.
Moving on (beyond the size of usual boy band) wake up wake up, 2 more to go: we have sixth: BTS J-Hope
He is a rapper too. One of his biggest fans is John Cena (famous wrestler in case you didn’t know) obviously because he put a pic of J-Hope on his Instagram page.
J-Hope’s first solo mixtape is here released March 2018. Highlights include HANGSANG and AIRPLANE – very groovy tunes. He has made history by getting on the Billboard US chart. Way to go!
Jin is the oldest member of BTS (age 25, grey hairs coming) born in deep winter on the 4th December 1992 (same year as Selena Gomez) in Gwacheon, South Korea.
He is known variously as: Worldwide Handsome, the third one from the left (they do have an order), Visual King, Car door guy (we don’t even know why), Sexy guy who cooks well.
He has two sugar gliders named Eomuk and Odeng which means fishcakes. They are small sleepy flying possums (i.e. flying squirrel that eats sweeties).
He hates horror movies. Except when he was on fire  and ironed by V in the BTS ‘Fire’ music video – check it out: it’s ace!!!
Righto – Mic Drop time, I’m off for a G&T and a lie down watching Casualty, hoping my appendix won’t burst.

The U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in a critical case testing the right of citizens to bring suit in the name of the United States in order to recover damages from corporations or individuals that have cheated the government. By taking up the case known as Schindler Elevator, the high court is looking into whether a private citizen can secure information from a Freedom of Information Act request and use that information to form the basis of a qui tam or False Claims Act whistleblower lawsuit. The chamber also wants the court to rule that ignoring government contract requirements that the contractor deems unimportant should not be considered cheating the government.
The whistleblower in Schindler brought his case under the False Claims Act, which has proven to be an enormous benefit to the U.S. government and taxpayers. It effectively deputizes the eyes and ears of private citizens. And it provides added incentive to individuals to police corporate malfeasance by requiring the government to pay bounties from proceeds recovered through False Claims Act litigation.
A slew of recent cases demonstrate the benefit of whistleblower litigation. Settlements of suits totaling hundreds of millions of dollars with Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, and Bristol- Myers were all cases initiated by whistleblowers.
From pharmaceutical fraud to defective military hardware, over $20 billion has been recovered since 1986 through cases started by whistleblowers under the False Claims Act. In each case the wrongdoer violated, or caused to be violated, a contract or regulation that conditioned on receipt of government funds. And lest anyone think the law can be gamed, Congress put in express limits on is usage: no whistleblower suit can be based on news media coverage, a congressional hearing or government audits or reports.
In the Schindler case, a Vietnam veteran, who alleged that his employer was not according proper affirmative action consideration to veterans, used information from such a FOIA request to confirm what he believed were violations of government contract requirements.
The Supreme Court is being asked by big businesses to expand the congressional limits so that whistleblower suits based on information secured through a Freedom of Information Act request would be barred by statute. This makes no sense and is contrary to the express terms of the law. If the whistleblower knows enough to request the information and has the ability to demonstrate how the government has been defrauded, there is no reason to preclude litigation which will expose fraud on the government and restore dollars to the Federal Treasury.
Moreover, the Chamber of Commerce, along with the American Hospital Association and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Research Association, also are using the Schindler case to argue that whistleblower suits based on an implied certification theory – where the contractor upon receipt of government money impliedly certifies compliance with the contract terms – should not be allowed to proceed at all.
Curiously, the Chamber of Commerce – whose web site purports to favor promotion of American jobs – disagrees with an application of the False Claims Act which would allow for enhanced compliance with, for example, “Buy American” obligations that are written into government contracts. In its “friend of the Court” brief in Schindler, the triumvirate of big business protectors deemed such obligations that are conditions of receiving taxpayer dollars “legal technicalities.”
While many of their members undoubtedly subsist on hefty government paydays, they complain that “contractors . . . are required to submit certifications related to everything from how they dispose of hazardous materials to their affirmative action plans and they frequently enter into contracts requiring compliance with other statutory and regulatory provisions.” One example provided in their brief is a certification that Medicare providers abide by “Medicare laws and regulations.” Imagine that!
The Chamber and its friends do not dispute that these are indeed obligations; they merely question the audacity of a law that would cause them to honor their commitments. By their lights, it is okay to place what they perceive to be merely technical legal requirements into a government contract as long as taxpayers have no direct ability to enforce those obligations.
Doing business with the government is a privilege and not a right. Compliance with government contracts and regulations is part of the deal. Those who enjoy this privilege should live up to its terms whether it means using products made in America, maintaining safe working conditions for employees, paying workers a living wage, or complying with environmental laws and regulations. In simple terms, those enjoying the benefit of government funds must honor all of their commitments to the government.
It’s clear from the Chamber’s arguments in Schindler that big business interests are looking for loopholes in their obligations to the government as well as to taxpayers. That makes the importance of the False Claims Act and other whistleblower laws all the more important in supporting honest practices and compliance with government contracting laws.

An independent tribunal set up by the Premier League has, this morning, concluded that Chelsea are to pay Manchester City an initial fee of £3.5 million for their young striker Daniel Sturridge who moved between the clubs last July.
That sum in isolation would seem like decent value for one of English football’s brightest prospects but there are a few other charges that, in addition, will add up to a ludicrous amount for a player who is (at best) a rough diamond.
The initial fee will rise to £6.5 million if Sturridge makes 40 appearances for The Blues plus £500,000 for every 10 appearances he makes in any competition up to the value of £2 million and a further £1 million if the striker plays for the full national team.
With Sturridge also said to be earning a reported £60,000-a-week at Stamford Bridge then, if all the aforementioned clauses are triggered, Chelsea may stand to shell out nearly £15 million on the 20 year old forward over his four year contract.
Manchester City will not see all of this cash though as Sturridge’s former club Coventry City stand to make a £350,000 windfall on the deal due to a prior sell-on clause put in place when the striker left The Sky Blue’s academy in 2003.

One of the most expensive forms of insurance is whole life and this is due to the fact of the cash value that it builds over time.

However, if you decide to change or renew your policy at any time, you may have to pay a higher monthly premium due to an older age. This is one of the reasons it is important to take your time and really study several policies.

Ready Fire Aim at Employees Only Miami, New York—there’s practically a direct line connecting both cities. Something else that binds us? Employees Only. We’re among the lucky handful of cities to claim an outpost of the West Village bar and its signature mescal cocktail: Ready Fire Aim. It’s the essential drink for anyone fond of the smoky spirit, in part because few bartenders in this city are as serious about mixing it in a cocktail as the uniformed folks at EO. Judges’ take: “The Ready Fire Aim is a good one: mescal, pineapple, habanero. We have a joke behind the bar when people come up to order mescal, they look both ways first and then sort of whisper, Do you have…mescal? Mescal is one of those things that's still sort of new.”
Best Bartender: Courtney Lane. Her given name may be Courtney, but like many badasses — Madonna, Cher, Beyoncé — this 26-year-old bartender is simply known as Lane. Starting out, as most drink slingers do, Lane did her share of working at dance clubs and socials in Gainesville, where she opened cans of Bud Light and poured rum and Cokes made with cheap well liquor. The petite blonde decided there's more to life behind the stick, and from there it's been accolade after accolade. In 2015, Lane got her big break working the artist and media bar at III Points. From there, it's been an uphill trajectory, with Lane working at what are arguably Miami Beach's finest cocktail bars — Employees Only and Broken Shaker. At the bar, she's a whirling dervish of shaking, mixing, and pouring. Recently, she and her Employees Only partner won top prize at the South Beach Wine & Food Festival's Art of Tiki competition for a drink they created. Lane is someone whom young girls should strive to be and everyone wants to know — a talented, driven woman who will fix you the best cocktail of your life.

It’s been a while since I last did a posting here. Happens occasionally, as I’ve been busy with lots of other things. But now I have great news to announce. My book Smugglers Train has been published in Germany by Moloko+. It’s a collection of 19 poems in the original English, plus six prose pieces (fiction & non-fiction) as excellently rendered into German by the well-known translator Pociao. The spiffy cover design and layout was done by Inga Tillere, who also contributed several eye-catching collages. In addition to which there are photos, including some of mine. I am understandably very pleased!
NB Do not confuse this publication with Smugglers Train & Other Stories, which was published a couple of years back by Barncott Press. That book is entirely in English and contains only fiction.

Online business is how I’ve made a living since 2003 and what has helped me retire early.  I make over $40,000 a month through my blog. You can create your own blog here with my easy 15-minute step-by-step tutorial.  You can start a blog for as little as $2.95 a month (less than a cup of coffee!).  Create a blog and leverage it into affiliate sales or product endorsement deals. Consider topics like:
You could also opt to use existing websites for making money. These include both active income and passive income methods. For example, you could sell some used items or invest in creating some digital designs that then can be sold on merchandise. Again, devote a sizable portion of your time to passive income so that you can slowly build up earnings that will arrive on autopilot without any extra added effort.
However, like anything else truly worthwhile, apps require a significant investment of your time or money upfront. If you don't have the skills, then you have to hire someone who can assist you in creating a great app. But first you need to come up with an idea that will sell. Do the proper market research and analytics to come up with the right app.

Similar to e-commerce websites such as Amazon and OLX, a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform is a marketplace for money lending activities. You can lend money to others in a more organised and structured manner using the P2P lending platform. The P2P platforms have the recovery process in place and one should understand it before using the services of the platform. Since this is an unsecured loan where there is no face-to-face interaction, a P2P lender needs to be aware of the risks involved. Currently, the interest rate earned can be anywhere from 13 percent to 30 percent.
There are loads of resources for making money online as an affiliate. You could source products from ClickBank, Commission Junction, Rakuten Marketing, Share-a-Sale, Impact Radius and many others. Plus, many of the larger companies have their own affiliate programs as well. Do your due diligence and find the right company with a relevant product or service to your audience that you can sell as an affiliate.
Research selling prices of items similar to yours. Look up completed sales or current listings of items similar to yours. Find the high- and low-end prices, and price your object around the median price level. If you want your item to sell quickly, price it at the low end. The condition of the item also affects the price. Items in poorer condition should be priced at the lower end. Also, consider how many listings there already are of items similar to yours. If many similar items will be competing with yours, you may have to set the price lower to get the sale.[28]
Once you’ve gathered a list, put together a template outreach email (as you’ll be doing this over and over) that’s short and clear with expectations. Tell your potential interviewee who you are, what your podcast is about, and what you’re asking of them. Do a few test interviews with friends and family to make sure everything is being recorded at the quality you want and then book your first episode.
While some might think that starting a blog is an arduous effort, when you understand the precise steps you need to take, it becomes far easier.

You can easily sell things like mini-email courses, full-blown trainings, ebooks, and so on.
High-ticket consulting or coaching: You could sell your own high-ticket consulting or coaching products from your website.

I think Drop shipping is the best way that can help you make money online. It is the only way that allows you to start an online business without investing capital in inventory, warehouse and to buy products individually from a wholesaler and ship them directly to your customer. Moreover, with my drop shipping experience, you will learn key strategies that you won’t learn anywhere else to help your online business grow and thrive.
Getting businesses to advertise on your podcast, either at the beginning or end, or both, is a great way to create a revenue through podcasts. Most businesses won’t be keen to advertise on your podcast until you can prove a large number of listeners. Therefore, it is unlikely you will be able to start out from the get-go with sponsors. But once you accumulate regular listeners, or a high number of downloads from iTunes, you can start to sell advertising space on your podcasts.
It’s sometimes hard to comprehend just how much people love t-shirts. And with the right niche, marketing, and tools, you can create an online t-shirt business that makes you extra money online while you sleep. (Even Bloomberg and Forbes feature stories from entrepreneurs who've done just that.) Services like TeeSpring make it easier than ever to create a t-shirt drop-shipping business where they handle the sales, printing, and shipping, and you’re only responsible for design and marketing. For more tips, check out this simple guide to launching and marketing an online clothing store by my friends over at Selz.

Steve and his wife have built a highly successful online store – selling wedding napkins – and he’s anxious to provide insider secrets to people who sign up for his course..
More than half a billion products are sold on Amazon every month, making it an incredible opportunity to make money online. But, like everything else that involves making money online, you have to do quite a bit of work to earn it. One option on Amazon is to find products that are already made and buy and sell them at a discount. For example, you could research generic products such as clocks, keychains and mugs to attach to your brand. For an incredible deep dive on how to make extra money with this strategy, check out how digital marketer Neil Patel recently did this as a public experiment right here on his blog.
Shopify is another great option if you are wanting to create your own eCommerce store. Shopify is arguably easier to set up than WooCommerce but will give you less control over your storefront and cost you more long term. However, if you have little to no experience of creating websites or using WordPress, or you are working to a very tight time schedule, then Shopify may be the perfect eCommerce platform for you.
Once you have decided what type of product you are going to sell, you need to decide where to sell them. Selling merchandise on Amazon or eBay aren’t your only options. Creating your own eCommerce store is another way to promote your products and generate sales. Once you have decided what you are going to sell, whether it is white labeled products, your own designs, or other people’s merchandise, you can set up an eCommerce website to display these products.
No matter what method you select for generating your online income, there's one very important thing to understand. Today, across this globe, with its 7+ billion inhabitants, there are two recurring things that people are looking for more of. Either people want more time or they want more money. The truth? Time is far more valuable than money. You can't recreate time. Once it's spent, it's gone forever. Not money.
The rise in the price of bitcoins made us seriously think about the devastating ecological consequences of this unique financial phenomenon. About them spoke back in 2013, the Australian analyst for environmental sustainability and entrepreneur Guy Lane. In the last months, the bubble of bitcoin has become much larger, and it has become widely known about the energy expenditure that accompanies it.
The creation (“mining”, mining) of bitcoins requires the execution of complex calculations that have no value, except that they must be publicly made. According to the latest estimates, the mining of bitcoins requires the same amount of energy as for the whole of New Zealand, and, perhaps, even more. If we allow the trend to continue unchecked in our world with a suffering ecology, the bitcoins will become an ecological disaster.
In the early days of bitcoin, all necessary calculations were performed on simple personal computers. But now, miners use specially built machines optimized for special bitcoin algorithms. The cost of “mining” is equal to the cost of electricity used. The only way to booby is beneficial – to have access to the cheapest electricity. And this is electricity, which is produced by the combustion of cheap coal at old stations. Mining bitcoin today is concentrated in China, which is still heavily dependent on coal.
The bitcoin network now uses about 30 terawatt hours per year or 0.1% of the world’s total energy consumption – more than individual consumption in more than 150 countries.
The price of electricity is about 5 cents per kilowatt-hour for industrial users. Miners with higher prices are mostly out of business. If the price of electricity is 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, and the price of bitcoin (say) is 10 thousand US dollars, then each bitcoin consumes about 150 megawatt hours of electricity. Under current rules, bitcoin tinctures allow the killing of 1,800 bitcoins per day, which indicates the daily use of 24,000 megawatt hours or about 100 terawatt hours per year, almost 0.3% of global electricity use.
Each megawatt-hour of coal energy is accompanied by emissions of a ton of carbon dioxide, so the terawatt-hour corresponds to one million tons of CO₂.
If such a high production price continues, the total annual energy use from bitcoin mining is likely to rise to 100 terawatt hours.
The transition of the entire global financial system to bitcoin will lead to an increase in the use of electricity in the world by about 500%. Given the current threat of climate change – this is an incredibly huge amount of energy consumption.

As Saathi Sanga Manka Kura (Chatting with my Best Friend) celebrates 15 years on air, how has one radio show captured the hearts and minds of so many Nepali youth for so long? Gemma Ferguson reports on SSMK’s 15th anniversary.
If you were to ask anyone what has changed in Nepal over the last 15 years, the list would be long and dramatic - the end of a civil war, the end of a monarchy, the rise in digital technology and social media, an explosion of FM and community radio stations - it seems that nothing has stayed constant. Nothing, that is, except the lively tune and welcoming voices of four friends chatting on a Saturday afternoon. Whether you find them by tuning a radio set, listening through a mobile phone or stream on the internet, the voices of the Saathi Sanga Manka Kura (SSMK) hosts have been there, without fail, every weekend since the program first went on air in April 2001.
Binita Shrestha, one of the early hosts, remembers the feeling that everyone in the production team had after airing that first episode: “Everyone had been planning and training and preparing for that moment for so long and suddenly it was here, SSMK was on air. None of us knew if anyone would listen. We knew there was nothing else on the radio produced by youth for youth – but we had no idea if young people would actually want to tune in”. But tune in they did, first in the hundreds and then thousands and then millions.
But young people didn’t just want to listen, they wanted to share their stories and within a few weeks of going on air the letters began to arrive. “I remember one of the letters that came in” said Kaustuv Pokharel, another former host, “it was from a young girl from Rukum and she wrote to tell us how she had been sexually abused by her own relative and there was no one she could talk to about it. At first we weren’t sure how to respond, it seemed such a big responsibility, but we decided that while we couldn’t tell our listeners what to do, we could help them think through their problems and give them skills to help them deal with issues they faced in life. We also knew that just by listening and sharing our own experiences, we could let listeners know they are not alone”.
The idea of a radio program that not only spoke, but also listened, was very new in Nepal. SSMK had tapped into something that was desperately needed by the young people who heard the show and soon the team was receiving hundreds of letters a week from people across the country. While each letter was unique, they all shared one thing - a deep sense of trust and affection for their four ‘best friends’ with whom they could chat, joke, laugh, share and open up to without judgement.
Over the last 15 years, almost 800 episodes of SSMK have been aired and while the original team graduated, new friends have joined and the lively format has stayed largely unchanged. Even the theme music is still the same score that was originally composed for that very first episode. Although young people don’t tend to write letters anymore, the program hosts still receive 1000’s of SMS, emails and Facebook messages every month and the ‘letter section’, where the hosts talk about the different issues raised by listeners, is still a very popular part of the show.
But with the arrival of distractions like Facebook and an explosion in the number of radio stations across Nepal (not to mention the music and videos available over the internet) what makes a radio program like SSMK stay relevant to young people for so long?
One reason for the success of the program is the team’s determination not to shy away from difficult topics. As one listener wrote to the show, “In Nepal it is hard to talk openly about sex and love…But in Saathi Sanga Manka Kura there are no taboos. Here young Nepalis learn how to take care of themselves and each other". Over the years, the show’s hosts have dealt sensitively with issues including HIV, abuse, sexuality, drugs, masturbation, puberty and menstruation. "Before SSMK started, there was no tradition of talking about such issues in Nepal," says Sabin Singh, the production team leader of SSMK, “the hosts talk about anything and everything - sexual and reproductive health, career or study concerns, family problems, whatever matters to our listeners."
This direct approach to issues has certainly won the show a place in the heart of Nepal’s youth, but it also brought criticism and on more than one occasion the threat to remove it from the airwaves. Binayak Aryal, one of the original team members, shares his memories of what happened after a show on condom use “I remember being questioned and interrogated because we spelt out the word 'condom' during an episode on sexual and reproductive health which was a big sensation then”. Despite the concerns, the hosts never shied away from the critics, but instead welcomed them in ‘’We were constantly accused of putting out vulgar content on the radio, so we invited the station managers in to see the letters we received to show that we were not making it up - this really was an issue that concerned young people”.
Thinking back over the last fifteen years of Nepal’s history, through the civil war, the people’s revolution, the birth of New Nepal, the struggles over the constitution and most recently the earthquake and reconstruction efforts, SSMK has seen the country go through a lot and the program has worked hard to ensure they have never gone off air or even missed a week. “It is important to us that, whatever else is going on in the lives of our listeners, they can at least depend on the program being there for them every week at the same time and same place, a solid friend they can rely on” says Meera, one of the newest hosts of the program.
So what’s next for the show? Will they be around for the next 15 years? The new team hope so. “It’s a lot of pressure taking on something like SSMK that has such a long legacy, but we take that responsibility seriously and we want to make sure the program keeps going from strength to strength and stays relevant to our listeners”. One way the show is doing that already is by producing and airing the show in four indigenous languages, “we know that for many young people, there is a lack of information available for them in a language they feel most comfortable with” says Sabin “so we wanted to address that by making SSMK in other languages”. With well-guarded plans afoot for the 15th anniversary birthday celebrations, the team are feeling excited for what lies ahead, “it is an honour to have been broadcasting to Nepal’s young people for the last 15 years, but why stop at 15? We hope to stay on air as long as our listeners want us to”. And with well-wishers such as Kunjana Ghimire (suntali), Rupa Joshi (Communication Manager, UNICEF Nepal), Madhav Raj Tiwari (assistant chief of news, Mountain TV), Manju Shrestha (famous TV artist) coming out to wish SSMK a happy 15th birthday, we can only hope that it stays in the heart of Nepal’s youth for many generations to come.
Saathi Sanga Manka Kura is funded by UNICEF and is produced by Equal Access in Nepal. The program airs every Saturday on Radio Nepal and over 50 radio stations in Nepal. www.ssmk.org; https://www.facebook.com/ssmkradio/

I and my husband decided not to have children until we are economically stable therefore I started using contraceptive pills in order to prevent pregnancy.

Writer. Sorry to say this but your comment is a ridiculous generalisation – about both directors and writers (shouldn’t that be creatives anyway?). And i think fights are not very common these days. My experience of working with some of the very best directors is that they’re also very nice people – and if you treat them with respect they’ll do the same to you

Unfettered 31.04 KB - The man with the golden eyes had a near irresistible aura. Sarah is in denial, confused and conflicted about her feelings for her best female friend like she's a preteen and not in her twenties. It's hard enough working at the same hospital, and science/">medicine is always going to be a charged profession. She just wants it to all go away for a while, just to catch a break. It's not something she would have expected. Not something she planned. But she's wrapped up in a stranger before she knows it and things begin to get seriously heated.

- influential people like Josiah Strong and Alfred T Mahan - impact of near war conflicts with European nations in the Pacific and Latin America (US/GER in Samoa, US/ENG in Venezuela)
- role of business leaders, view of President Cleveland, role of Liliuokalani, reasons for eventual annexation in 1898
- sympathy for Cubans, USS Maine, Yellow Journalism, McKinley's reasons to go to war, Teller Amendment, overall reasons for US to get involved
- locations of war, military strengths of US, US casualties of war, newly acquired possessions, controversy surrounding them and justifications for taking them, growth of Anti-imperialists and the Insular Cases, Platt Amendment
- Russo-Japanese War, fallouts with Japan and Russia, Japanese immigrants in California, Gentleman's Agreement, Root-Takahira agreement
Various developments provoked the previously isolated United States to turn its attention overseas in the 1890s. Among the stimuli for the new imperialism were the desire for new economic markets, the sensationalistic appeals of the yellow press, missionary fervor, Darwinist ideology, great-power rivalry, and naval competition. Strong American intervention in the Venezuelan boundary dispute of 1895 - 1896 demonstrated an aggressive new assertion of the Monroe Doctrine and led to a new British willingness to accept American domination in the Western Hemisphere. Longtime American involvement in Hawaii climaxed in 1893 in a revolution against native rule by white American planters. President Cleveland temporarily refused to annex the islands, but the question of incorporating Hawaii into the United States triggered the first full-fledged imperialistic debate in American history. The splendid little Spanish-American War began in 1898 over American outrage about Spanish oppression of Cuba. American support for the Cuban rebellion had been whipped up into intense popular fervor by the yellow press. After the mysterious Maine explosion in February 1898, this public passion pushed a reluctant President McKinley into war, even though Spain was ready to concede on the major issues. An astounding first development of the war was Admiral Deweys naval victory in May 1898 in the rich Spanish islands of the Philippines in East Asia. Then in August, American troops, assisted by Filipino rebels, captured the Philippine city of Manila in another dramatic victory. Despite mass confusion, American forces also easily and quickly overwhelmed the Spanish in Cuba and Puerto Rico. After a long and bitter national debate over the wisdom and justice of American imperialism, which ended in a narrow proimperialist victory in the Senate, the United States took over the Philippines and Puerto Rico as colonial possessions. Regardless of serious doubts about imperialism, the United States had strongly asserted itself as a proud new international power. Americas decision to take the Philippines aroused violent resistance from the Filipinos, who had expected independence. The brutal war that ensued was longer and costlier than the Spanish-American conflict. Imperialistic competition in China deepened American involvement in Asia. Hays Open Door policy helped prevent the great powers from dismembering China. The United States joined the international expedition to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. Theodore Roosevelt brought a new energy and assertiveness to American foreign policy. When his plans to build a canal in Panama were frustrated by the Colombian Senate, he helped promote a Panamanian independence movement that enabled the canal to be built. He also altered the Monroe Doctrine by adding a Roosevelt Corollary that declared an American right to intervene in South America. Roosevelt negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese War but angered both parties in the process. Several incidents showed that the United States and Japan were now competitors in East Asia.

With a 150% mobile penetration rate and over 80% of the population that are active on the internet, having an online presence is crucial for your business in Singapore. However you may be debating whether you need a dedicated website and it is a difficult decision – maintenance cost can easily creep on and relevant content and layout require constant attention and resources.
Humans are visual creatures and businesses with professional-looking websites do give positive first impressions. In fact, Stanford University Persuasive Technology Lab found that around 50% of your visitors assess your website based on superficial aspects alone.
Here’s a scenario: imagine visitors visiting your closed store and they are interested in your operating hours. How do you think they would feel if they see:
With a), your visitor may even question the information source! The same principle applies to your website – it should act as a legitimate source to display important information. Treat your site like your brick-and-mortar store.
As your business grows, you want to be able to reach out to your new and existing customers for marketing needs. Your most supportive customers are happy to leave behind testimonials along with their contact and you may instinctively store them in an Excel spreadsheet… until the task becomes unmanageable as your database grows. This is a process that you will want to automate before precious time is consumed by menial data entry and management.
One way to easily grow your database is to integrate customised forms for your website visitors to fill in. The data is automatically stored in a consistent format and it is easy for you to quickly reach out to your entire base. If you have more customer data, you can analyse their profiles and provide more targeted and persuasive content or products.
One main perk of having an online presence is that anyone anywhere can learn about your business without ever stepping out of their house. As the owner, you can operate with minimal overheads because the site is ‘self-manned’ with relevant content displayed and if it’s an e-commerce site, your ‘store’ is always open. (As an unintended bonus, an untrained part-time staff can use it for reference too!)
How then, can you leave a great impression on these online visitors whom you may never meet? A unique site experience is one of the easiest ways! When you have your own website, you can create a bespoke experience that stands out among millions of online websites. A well-designed website is a more reliable ‘spokesperson’ for your business compared to the damage an inexperienced hire may cause.
What started off as ‘just a website’ can easily balloon into a mammoth project overnight so perhaps, you’re happy with just a Facebook page for now.
There is one little thing you can do regardless – purchase a unique site name or domain name and configure it to redirect the visitor to your Facebook page. Having your unique company website on your marketing collaterals conveys credibility and you don’t have to manage an additional platform that may not add value to your business at this point in time.
Convinced? Kick off your website project now by purchasing a unique domain name (For this August only, pay just S$5.35 to own your own .sg domain) and start building!

its about a 50 50 shot at saving it. remove it from the lever, remove plastic bottom cover. do not remove nut holding the guts together. pic out any old grease you can. then spray the crap out of it with wd-40 to try and free up the pawls. then spray with engine cleaner scrub the best you can with an old tooth brush, rinse with hot water, dry well with hair dryer and re lube with oil, not wd-40 as it is not a lube.

There are two kinds of people in the world, "Those who help themselves to people, and those who help people!"
Someone mentioned this in another thread. It's a decent attempt, not quite as good as earlier incarnations of Sci-Fi's anime blocks. Noein is awesome. First anime I've seen in a long time that seems to have an interesting story. So far. Tokko's not bad either, but it seems to rely on incestuous humor for most of its...charm.
The current version is indeed pretty inhuman...Don't worry its all 'fixed' for the next release(5 different skills, more human like aiming etc)
I thought I would dust away the cobwebs and get back into Maya with one of my fav evil characters of all time - Cain from Robocop 2. Although the film no where near as good as 1 I love the look and feel of this guy.
First and foremost you have to check this guys real life model he built with working screen. www.ukmonsters.co.uk/robocain
Using this guys photos and ref from the film and my own 4" model (the one he uses to compare his model to).
So far I have blocked out the head and neck pistons but not happy with them. Then started on the feet and think they are finished now. Moving on to the legs next.
Finishing off the lower leg but noticed a few dings on one of the rods I`ll have to go fix. Some real tricky shape to this monster.
Just noticed some normal issues on the knee pad that have been corrected now but not worth a re-render.
Spent the day sorting out the naming and grouping of all the parts and coping the right leg over. Outliner never been so sorted. I have also gotten the middle section done. Will sort the pistons out once I have the upper body sorted
The guy has 4 arms - the upper ones larger than the lower ones with pipes going from the base to the upper arms.
Upper right arm done - apart from cables, again due to the fact I think it would be easier to pose this before creating them. Going to leave it till all the arms are done then do them all together I think.
Going through all my ref photos it turns out I missed a lot of details from the hand area (mostly because I was looking at my crap little model) so spent the morning adding the missing parts.
Out of all the arms this is the only part of all of them that are the same on both sides. This is hard model as there is very little to mirror, but still finding it fun.
Cracked on with this tonight with only the hand of the lower right arm to do (well say hand - more like welding kit). Was hoping to get it done tonight but brain shutting down - time for sleep.
Well corrected a few errors I made while I was tired yesterday and finished the off the hand (Apart from a small panel covering some joints).
the tomb of some warrior king from some gothic fantasy thing, you know the sort those big strangely shaped columns will be horns of some mythical creature. the obelisk type thingies, the torches, the gate and the hallway will be decorated in a cathedral like fashion. The rest sand and rocks
Not yet unwrapped cos the wings unwrapper is proving to be wierd, it says numeric problem…if anyone has a clue to the solution pls let me know

thx, its not textured yet and wings unwrapper is horrid but I might try it in another 3d program demo so fingers crossed

I almost bought one the last time I was in the market for a car (shortly before moving here) but ended up with a Suzuki SX4 only because of the significant price difference between it and the Impreza. So far I have been happy with the Suzuki.
I had a tranny go out on one, but it was my fault for not checking the level, it was my 81. The seals on the output shafts leaked as I drove and "spit" it out, so I never saw a puddle.....First time I saw an early Subie I had just hole shot my pile of mud from my 4x4 truck and covered my buddies windsheild, I was on the floor laughing as the SPARE was under the hood over the transaxle (had to remove it to check the tranny fluid, hence my not checking it).

THE FACTS: Public face of leading multi-media empire floats bizarre conspiracy theory about Malaysian flight disappearance.
THE FALLOUT: Lucky for News Corp shareholders, nothing. Fox News is still tops in the cable ratings, and 20th Century Fox’s Searchlight Pictures just nabbed a Best-Picture Oscar for 12 Years a Slave. But with a huge group of critics and detractors waiting to pounce on anything Murdoch does in the public sphere, a social media gaffe like the above may convey an image of Murdoch as out of touch with reality, and possibly ready for retirement. This is not a good thing for News Corp. stock, especially given the looming phone hacking probes in the U.K. that might end up costing the empire millions in damages.
THE LESSON: Social Media Meltdowns happen everywhere, all the time, and with 91% of your employees using social media every day at work, it’s no longer a question of “if”, but “when” it will happen to you.

At last a page from Dinlos and Skilldos appears on the blog! This is a page I'm (almost) happy with, it's page one of a three page strip that appears throughout the book, I guess there will be 6 or 7 Bedtime Stories in all. It's not typical of the book as a whole and I apologise if it verges on the unintelligible. Hopefully you find the language fun even if you don't fully grasp the meaning. As someone whose idea of 'reading' comics as a dyslexic child was just following the pictures I wanted to have at least one strip in Dinlos where the words decorated the illustrations rather than the other way round.
Kackernory speaks in a kind of pidgin-Romany, that may not even be understandable to some Gypsies. There isn't any standard written Romany, it's a spoken language that varies from one area to another and from one country to the next. All the same I'd hope that Gypsies from a number of countries would recognise enough of the words to have as clear a grasp of what's going on as an English reader.
Like I say, the rest of the book is set out to be very immediate and easy to read so this is the exception.
I've been using this page to experiment with different techniques and trying to avoid ending up with a total dog's dinner. I doubt there will many pages with quite this amount of texture and competing ideas on, but I've learnt a lot doing it.
Here's last month's spot illustration for Doctor Who magazine. It's for an audio adventure called Time Reef. Mindful of other illustration blogs that include roughs and pencils I'm sticking up the process for this illo.
I produced a quick colour rough with my faithful wacom in Photoshop, DWM approved, then I did some finer, "proper" figure drawing type stuff (also in Photoshop) before exporting it over to Illustrator. I should point out that the folks at DWM, aware of my various styles, asked for something not too cartoony.
In Illustrator I just draw over the top of the image freehand using the pencil tool with the stroke set to zero. Most illustrators use the vector tools to make perfect shapes. The truth is I didn't understand how to use illustrator when I started (still don't!) and so picked up the pencil tool and started drawing shapes of colour and sticking them together. The Monk and Cat image from the Guardian that sits in the top right corner of this blog page is an early example of my Adobe Illustrator stuff.
I'll be starting on my next spot illo for DWM soon (a Colin Baker one! Eek!), I've had the brief for a couple of weeks, but I haven't got a clue what I'm going to do with it yet. It'll certainly be done in Illustrator though, I love the way it leaves drawing looking so immediate and fresh. Perfect for spot art that should have impact without becoming dominant and distracting. Basically Adrian Salmon's Time Team illustrations are perfect for the magazine in that respect, mine are attempting to do a similar job.
No, I'm not a professional mesmerologist, man of mystery and hokum cloakum dazzler to the stars. I am the bloke wot does the pictures on them Horrible Histories and Murderous Maths books. Well, not all of them. My master and keeper, Martin Brown, still has a hand in pretty much everything horrible in history and Philip Reeve was responsible for all the old Murderous Maths stuff (whatever became of him, eh? Oh, that's right, he went on to write the marvelous Mortal Engines books.)
Actually, this cover was yesterday's job. These covers don't earn me a fortune, but they are very quick to do - couple of hours at most, so they are a pleasure really. I'm currently doing a full colour 96 page book for MM which is taking considerably longer. And as I have three other books lined up between now and January I should be getting on with it rather than blogging.

This paper is concerned with the convergence analysis of an identification algorithm for a class of nonlinear dynamic systems. The class includes systems that can be separated into symmetric zero-memory nonlinear gain parts and linear dynamic parts. A model reference adaptive technique is applied to the identification of such a nonlinear dynamic system after taking the following three points into consideration: 1) approximation of the nonlinear characteristics by a set of functions, 2) introduction of a set of parameters to obtain a multi-input, single-output system which is equivalent to the nonlinear system and 3) selection of an appropriate input signal. The convergence analysis of the proposed identifier is investigated from the stochastic view-point. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed identifier.

This skills program is a reprise of show numbers 15 and 16, first posted on October 20th, 2005. It's the story of backpacker Mike Bargetto and his three relatives, who started out on a casual autumn backpacking trip in October of 2004. The weather was pleasant when they arrived at their Rae Lake camp site, in California's John Muir Wilderness.
Unfortunately, the weather changed drastically, and their only hope was a rescue. The rescue team was lead by Lieutenant Phil Caporale, of the Fresno County Sheriff's Search and Rescue unit. He and Mike tell the story of the rescue from both perspectives.
See the supplemental information link, below, to learn about how you can be better prepared for unexpected mountain storms, and how to stay safe in such conditions. Follow that link, as well, for a bonus audio clip of our interview with Lieutenant Phil Caporale, with his final analysis of Mike and his companion's predicament.
In our original posting of the article and script for edition #66, Wilderness Deals for Wheels, we misspelled the name of IMBA communications director Mark Eller as Mark Ehler. We corrected this in our published transcript and in the article.
Unfortunately, we were unable to correct the pronunciation in our program from AY-LER to EL-ER. Sorry about that, Mark!
This wild places program investigates the relationship of the popular sport of mountain bicycling to wilderness preservation. What do these groups want when they lobby for the protection of wild places?
John Kramer, the acting Wilderness Manager for the Pacific Southwest Region of the National Forest Service.
Mark Eller, Communications Director for the International Mountain Bicycling Association, also known as IMBA.
A recent point of contention between wilderness groups and mountain bicycling groups was over the establishment of the King Range Wilderness. This wilderness was established in October, 2006, as part of the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Wilderness Act.
The bonus material linked below includes additional interview clips about responsible mountain bike riding in the backcountry. Steve talks to Tom Ward, the California Policy director of the International Mountain Bicycling Association and Ben Lawhon, the education director of the Leave No Trace Center for Outdoor Ethics.

About two months ago, Steve was interviewed for a future cover story on Podcast Alley. That interview was just posted last night.
This skills program illustrates how easy it is to prepare your own home-cooked meals in the backcountry. Though the commercially-packaged foods are very convenient, you could save money and get exactly what you like by making your own.
Steve demonstrates how to make one of his favorite pre-packaged dried meals, a vegetarian spaghetti. We also hear from:
Mary Howley Ryan, the nutritional advisor for the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). She also appeared in edition numbers 51, 52, & 64.
See the supplemental information link, below, for the text of that recipe, and links to sources of dried ingredients. If you're looking for more recipes, Backpack Gear Test reviewed backcountry cookbooks in our edition number 9, Backpacking Cookbook Reviews.
In case you can't, or would rather not listen to audio on your computer, and you don't have an MP3 player to download The WildeBeat into, there's now another option: You can now listen to the latest edition of The WildeBeat by phone.

This skills program is a look at the dehydrated food options for backcountry travelers. What goes into making these things? Are they real food? Are they good food and good for you?
Don Gearing, president of TyRy, Inc. They manufacture Alpine Aire, Richmoor, and Natural High brands of dehydrated meals.
Melanie Cornutt, assistant manager of retail products for Oregon Freeze Dry. They manufacture the Mountain House brand of dehydrated meals.
Mary Howley Ryan, the nutritional advisor for NOLS wraps up the story with her take on the value of fast food for backcountry travelers.
Many of these companies use the freeze drying process to preserve their foods. It's a rather complicated, energy-intensive process requiring expensive equipment. Other manufacturers use a more simple heat and dehumidified-air dehydrating process.
Russel Nelson from Utah called to compare the human waste pack-out rules and systems between Mount Whitney, as we discussed in editions 62 and 63, and the narrows in Zion National Park.

Kurt Repanshek tracks news and political issues about the National Parks. He occasionally talks about his own outings and gear choices as well.
Kraig collects comments and news about some of the more extreme and adventurous activities going on in the outdoors.
This wild places program investigates an effect that 20,000 hikers and climbers a year have on the trail to Mount Whitney (14,498'). In order to preserve the environment and scenic beauty of that narrow, rocky canyon, the Inyo National Forest has had to take Leave No Trace a step further.
Brian Spitek, Wilderness Manager for the Mount Whittney Ranger District of the Inyo National Forest.

It's been over two years since I described Civcraft, the Minecraft server about emergent societies. A lot has happened.
Gondolin, under a successful model of minimalist federated monarchy, enjoyed a year of growth and political relevance, becoming the largest single state and first functioning empire of Civcraft. The city of Aristopolis grew from a ruined village to this, serving as our de facto capital and a center of trade for the quadrant.
Almost a year to the day after Gondolin's founding, an incident led to the announcement that map backups had been leaked and we would have to start a new one. And so the first era ended, with more than a year and 20,000 unique accounts to its name. Civcraft 2.0 launched in late May, after only a month of preparation.
When the server reset, we had a distinct opportunity to introduce new variables into the experiment. These changes included custom terrain generation, mass production factories, and one of my own ideas: restricting plant and animal fertility by biome.
As players, we also saw a fresh start and the chance to reform our virtual societies literally from the ground up. My friend and compatriot berge403, having succeeded me as King of Gondolin, led a movement to found a planned international community on the rim of the 30km-wide world. Metropolis would be a commonly held region dotted with designated city plots, each self-governed and uniquely styled. The dual centerpieces were to be two huge cities: Minas Minas of Gondolin and Solis of SPQR, an allied Roman faction that had outgrown its role as a Gondolin territory.
Unfortunately for us, Gondolin and the Metropolis never really took off. Some of the cities backed out or failed to take hold, while the daunting scale of work to be done in Minas Minas and Solis drove many players to more happening places. A string of raids and the attrition of Gondolin leadership sealed its fate. The dream of Metropolis slowly faded into obscurity, but berge and I weren't satisfied to give up on Civcraft just yet.
By this time we had effectively stopped playing, lending our time instead to the reddit meta-game and helping with development. Some of the features had not played out quite as planned or were not balanced, and people were starting to see some serious problems with 2.0 mechanics.
There was talk of 3.0 and breaking changes that would be impractical and unfair to patch in now. We were in the heat of it, heedlessly proposing new concepts, hoping that someday Civcraft would be ready for them. The Civcraft admins firmly rejected another reset (3.NO!) as it would undermine the whole concept of social consequences, but as we talked berge and I found that we were converging on a radically different vision of how Civcraft should work.
And so we decided to fork the Civcraft model to a new server. The thought process went pretty much like this:
Thus Bergecraft was born in a storm of what-ifs. Our philosophy is to iteratively try the crazy ideas that wouldn't fly on Civcraft yet and invest some time playing with and refining them without the obligation of long-term support or continuity. That means short cycles, planned resets, and a whole lot of prototyping. We bill ourselves as the unofficial R&D lab of Civcraft.
Officially launching on March 1, the first iteration was a modest rehash of Civcraft 1.0 mods with the addition of Extra Hard Mode to make mining and PvE more challenging. Players joined by the dozens, and for the most part loved it. After setting our baseline we continued on to address PvP in April-May, lessening the exponential advantage of better gear and the domination of Protection IV. At that point we took a hiatus to help both servers get ready for the 1.7.10 upgrade and the transition of many of our shared plugins to player UUIDs.
Now that those are stabilizing, we're putting the final touches on Iteration 3, our most ambitious yet. The theme this time is resource scarcity, a factor which Civcraft's huge and bountiful world is severely lacking. Our map will be only 2km wide, featuring a new style of terrain and ore generation. I wrote a plugin that forces players to smelt their ores in factories, which will be wastefully inefficient. The idea is that easily accessible materials will quickly start to run out, a situation that has not been seen on this type of server.
So that's where Bergecraft stands. In the wake of drama surrounding CraftBukkit and the Microsoft acquisition the future of Minecraft servers is very uncertain, so we've considered jumping ship after this one to build on an open-source platform instead. Assuming we do continue with Minecraft we have several months worth of features to try. Environmental acclimation, agriculture, a more pronounced tech tree, and advanced machinery are all on our roadmap. We will continue to diverge from Civcraft, but hopefully sift out some features along the way that can be fed back into its future development. On the other hand, maybe Bergecraft will become something all its own.
Bergecraft Iteration 3 is launching soon at bergecraft.com for vanilla Minecraft 1.7.10. Our server community is at reddit.com/r/bergecraft.

The causes of ear disorders are due to infection, allergy, foreign bodies, or tumors. Your veterinarian will examine the ear canal with an otoscope which allows the long canal to be inspected along its entire length. The exam will also help your veterinarian determine if the eardrum is intact. This may require sedation or anesthesia if the ear is very painful or if the pet is not cooperative. A sample of the discharge will be examined under a microscope for any organisms. This information will help your veterinarian in developing an appropriate treatment plan.
Infections of the ear can be due to yeast, bacteria, or ear mites. Yeast infections are by far the most common, accounting for an estimated 75% of cases in dogs. Bacterial infections cause about 20% of ear infections, and ear mites cause about 5% (or less) of cases in dogs. Bacteria resistant to antibiotics are an increasing cause of ear infections. This is diagnosed with a culture and sensitivity by a laboratory. Some bacterial infections can even perforate the eardrum.
Allergies are a very common cause of ear problems, in fact, many of the yeast infections are secondary to an underlying allergy. If there are recurring ear symptoms, allergy is almost certainly the cause. Environmental allergens such as pollen, molds, and house dust mites are frequent causes of allergy. Food allergy is also a common cause of ear problems. A pet is not allergic to a brand of food, but is allergic to one or more food ingredients. A food trial is the only method to determine if a food allergy is an etiology. There is no reliable blood or intradermal skin test for food allergy. Consequently, flea allergy is generally not a cause of ear abnormalities.
Occasionally a foreign body will make its way into the ear canal and cause irritation or even perforate the eardrum. Pieces of plants, especially seedpods called foxtails, are a common foreign body that can cause ear problems. Anesthesia may be needed to remove the object. Tumors, which are even more rare, may develop in the ear canal and cause a blockage. Surgery may be needed to remove the mass and pathology should be performed to determine if it is benign or malignant.
Treatment of ear problems will depend on the cause of the disease, for example, a bacterial infection is treated differently than a yeast infection. A foreign body needs removal while ear mites need a parasite treatment. In general, treatment often involves oral medicine, topical medicine, and ear cleansers. It is also important to know whether the eardrum is intact, as many topical medications can't be used if there is a ruptured eardrum. In more advanced cases surgery may be the preferred method of treatment.
Ear problems are a malady your veterinarian sees on a regular basis. Most are healed with routine treatment but some cases can be more challenging. It is important to have a thorough exam, appropriate treatment and a follow-up plan to check on progress and ensure complete recovery. Many "repeat" infections are cases that never truly healed completely. Your veterinarian is your pet's best friend when it comes to ear problems so don't hesitate to call with your questions or make an appointment if you are concerned that your pet may be experiencing ear problems.

The creators of Velvet Collar, a comic book series which examines the lives of male sex workers and the impact of the rentboy raid, are sex worker Bryan Knight and queer comic artist Dave Davenport. I interviewed Bryan in person and Dave by email for Tits and Sass.

Several are personal friends; they’ve signed waivers, legally allowing me to use their likenesses and names, although I stick with their performer names.”
The essay I published in December, “A Project in Written Persuasion”, discusses the impact of GPS-enabled cruising apps on gay culture. I called the new paradigm an efficient, globalized, government-funded ecosystem of desire. These apps grant us superpowers: we see each other through brick walls; we detect prospects with these prosthetic antennae.

Highlighting the prevailing media treatment of women in sex work: “visual titillation with a side of moral rebuke,” LB discussed the rentboy.com shutdown, power narratives, agency, and the real harm of policies conflating trafficking and sex work.
A well-read sex worker knows that male prostitutes are rarely, if ever, written about, or spoken of, with such condescension. Dominick, a former escort who, for three years, wrote the popular Ask Dominick advice blog for Rentboy says, “The disparity boils down to sexism.” The “Pipe down, you poor, prostituted women, and let the real feminists tell you what’s what” tack is, he says, “trite heroic fantasy couched in paternalism.”

Firebrick helps B2B technology companies accelerate revenue growth through game-changing positioning strategies.
We reshape the way companies talk about themselves, drive breakaway differentiation and create buyer urgency. The world does not need more boring “geek-speak”. Give your company and products the powerful positioning they deserve.
"Firebrick is my go-to resource for positioning. Their process was core to building our category leadership and differentiating our product in a crowded market. Highly recommended!"
"Firebrick is the best at B2B positioning, category creation and differentiation. Their process is fast and provoking. The positioning was instrumental in helping us scale and defend our market leadership position and it had an immediate positive impact in our sales cycles. Firebrick helped us find a much bigger, more powerful way to communicate our unique value and why we matter. I will use them every time"
"No matter how good the company or the products, if you don't position yourself right in the market, your opportunity for growth will be impacted. Firebrick moved us beyond speeds and feeds to talk about the real challenges and opportunities facing our customers in the market. It was a game changer."
"We were launching a new line of business and offerings within a 140+ year old technology company that has people selling in 180+ countries. We engaged with Firebrick for two years to comprehensively help us with positioning, segmentation, propensity to buy, multi-stakeholder messaging, sales training and all external content. The results were award-winning products, a rapidly growing business and going from a customer perspective of sixth to first. Firebrick was instrumental to our external and internal success and I'd recommend their unique approach to everyone."
"Our work with Firebrick was truly transformational for our company. A real inflection point. The positioning helped us shift from features to engaging buyer conversations. And Firebrick gave us a much more strategic viewpoint. Now, our sales team is able to engage prospects and market analysts with new thinking. Because of the positioning, they are seen as advisors, showing the business impact that we can bring to market. I can’t recommend Firebrick enough"
“I've used Firebrick twice and each time they helped us develop a broader story for our business to communicate our differentiation in a fresh and engaging way. The Firebrick process provided our teams the perspective and collaboration necessary to build and gain consensus on a new narrative that cut through the noise, grew resonance with buyers and impacted sales cycles. I highly recommend Firebrick for any B2B positioning.”
"I'm thrilled we worked with Firebrick on our positioning. They were incredibly helpful at aligning our executive team and driving us to tell a bigger, differentiated story. They are game changing and gave us a fresh viewpoint to engage our buyers and disrupt a crowded market category. I'd definitely recommend working with them if you're looking to make positioning a priority in your organization."
Gone are the days of tech companies strong-arming their way to success through sheer sales effort. Positioning is the key strategic lever in today’s crowded markets to help companies rise above the ever-changing noise, distinguish themselves in the minds of customers, and drive premium valuation and revenue growth. Every significant technology company and market leader has this in common: a winning positioning strategy and a fresh, compelling, differentiated story and viewpoint.
You know you have created something great, why are you playing at the level of your competition? Why settle for the status quo? Your product deserves better. Every tech company wants to realize its highest potential, but it’s a very rare executive team that can identify and clearly articulate their own true unique genius. And if you can’t see it, your customers can’t either. You must imagine more. It takes an outside perspective to truly see your core differentiators and bring it to life with a point of view that inspires your buyers and separates you from the pack.
It’s not about you and your features. Category leaders are exquisitely clear about explaining “why they matter” versus “how it works”. Buyers don’t care about how your product works. This comes later. They want to know how your product will rock their world. What big buyer problem do you solve? The answer to this question is everything. Engaging today’s buyers requires a fundamental shift from product-centric positioning to positioning that puts the buyers in the center.
The product-led sale doesn’t cut it. Feature wars, low ASP and pricing discounts are a sure sign of a positioning problem. The technology industry is littered with a trail of failed companies that had technologically superior products, but were overtaken by competitors with a stronger positioning strategy and concise differentiated story. Today’s winners depend upon good products brought to life by the strength of powerful, concise, differentiated positioning that strikes a chord in the hearts and minds of your buyers.
Tech is moving faster than ever, and capitalizing on frequent inflection points means selling to new sets of buyers with emerging problems, and competing with unknown players. But your business was set up pre-inflection point, and you’re positioned to execute on yesterday’s strategy and buyers. Positioning to yesterday’s buyers is a sure-fire way to dampen revenue growth. If you want to be your best and break away from the crowd, you must have a point of view and value proposition that engages your next set of buyers.
Positioning is no longer a marketing initiative, but a strategic initiative championed by the executive team. If positioning is done right, it will not only impact market awareness and sales cycles but also product priorities, the type of sales people you hire, your ecosystem of partners, as well as valuation. This is not a marketing game. It’s the game-changing, CEO initiative that becomes a rallying cry and guiding Northstar for the company. If done right, you (and your buyers) will never see your company the same way.
If you want to truly differentiate and stand out from the crowd, you can hire branding agencies to make you look good, PR companies to spread the word and product marketing to communicate your features and functions. But it’s all a waste of time and money, if you haven’t first identified your own unique genius and be prepared to change the world by communicating this core essence through a compelling strategic narrative. This is the heart of true strategic positioning. This is not branding or messaging. Positioning is laser focused on “owning” a corner of the room, clear differentiation, justifying a premium price, moving higher in sales cycles, influencing the buying category criteria and commanding a higher valuation.
We are for executives making a big bet on a change in strategy, and who absolutely have to get it right the first time. Our clients come to us because “good enough” is just not enough. We are for forward-thinking tech leaders who want to make a difference, create a movement, leave a legacy – and ultimately make a lasting impact on the lives of their customers and employees.
With over 400 engagements to date, we have helped create successful positioning platforms that deliver big impact.
We're former tech execs, 100% focused on B2B technology positioning. We offer unparalleled expertise in positioning strategies that move the revenue needle. We don't do colors or brand logos. Our proven process is derived from working with over 400 tech companies, delivering fresh, differentiated positioning.
We have a successful track record creating positioning strategies that clearly differentiate and separate our clients from the pack. We are at the forefront of the latest positioning practices, helping Silicon Valley's market movers engage and excite buyers in a new way.
We're a fit for the game-changers who want to own markets, create a movement and enjoy a sustained competitive advantage. We are for executives where “good enough” positioning is no longer OK. We detest boring messages and pride ourselves on helping companies achieve the upper hand with positioning that brings their products alive.
We are for fast-paced executives seizing opportunity in a limited market window. With our proven process, our clients get results in as little as six to eight weeks. We are a forcing function, pushing our clients forward to create the best possible positioning storyline and drive it to the point of operationalization.

Her cargo seemed primarily to be lumber bound for Chicago although she was known to carry flour and salt at times.
On Saturday evening, at approximately 8 o'clock, the schooner Andromeda sunk about 25 miles east of Kewaunee. Her sinking was possibly due to damage she received prior to her foundering. After the vessel was discovered to be leaking, the crew found they could not make the pumps work, and the schooner sank almost immediately. The crew took to the small boat and reached Manitowoc on Sunday morning, and the steamer Arctic took the crew to Sheboygan.
"The loss is a severe one to the Captain (Morgan), as he had only purchased the vessel last spring, and on this trip had invested his season's earnings in salt, and lost everything." MS 7/22/1858 p. 1, c 4
The Andromeda most likely foundered 40 miles northeast of Manitowoc although one source places her 20 miles from Sheboygan approximately 15 miles from shore.

Roasting your own coffee beans can be a rewarding, and tasty, experience. It can be as easy or technical depending on how you want to make it.
The process is incredibly simple, and quick. In fact, depending on the chosen method, you can expect the process to take around 10 minutes to make a small batch and 16 minutes to create a large batch. And the simple process; apply heat to transform green fresh coffee beans into yummy brown roasted coffee.
When it comes to roasting coffee there are many different methods. Your chosen method should be decided by the quantity of coffee you wish to produce, as well as the amount of money you have to spend D.I.Y Methods.
One of the best ways to get started is using items you have at your disposable. If you have a Hot Air Popcorn Popper then that works great, otherwise a stovetop or oven can also be used.
Another great method, and particularly if you have a little extra cash is to buy a coffee roasting appliance. An appliance should come with a timer and a collection for chaff. Although higher end appliances should come with temperature control, air flow control and smoke suppression. A good air roasted should take less than 10 minutes to roast even unscorched beans. This makes them perfect for roasting small quantites for maximum freshness.
To start with I recommend choosing a sampler pack of green beans. This should help you learn about the major differences, as well as some subtler differences between regions. When you’ve identified your favourite region pick multiple green beans to further narrow it down.

First up, can you give us a quick rundown of your career highlights and tell us what you've been doing for the past decade?
Probably the biggest thing I've done in the US was launching IGN.com. When I arrived at Future in 1997 (then called Imagine Publishing), there was a staff of about 9 people creating a bunch of different web sites about the PlayStation, Dreamcast and whatnot.
We consolidated them all into a network called IGN and thanks to a rather creative affiliate program where we linked to about a billion fan sites, IGN became the 20th biggest site on the web and had about 100 editorial staff. We all thought we were going to be billionaires, but the dot-com bubble burst and the value of our paper money was not worth the paper it was written on.
Fortunately the site survived, and it's still going strong today. Since then I've worked with some big corporations on their web sites/marketing (great money, not-so-fun-work) such as Walmart and Dell, before rejoining Future a couple of years ago as Editorial Director to launch its new US Custom Publishing Division...

Learn Colors, Sizes, and the names of Marvel Superheroes (Spiderman, Hulk, Captain America, and Iron Man) by transforming mini toys into larger figures using spinners! We use a red, green, blue, and yellow fidget spinner to transform mini figures into Playskool toys. Toddlers can hear and see the name of the colors and the names of heroes to practice reading and sight word recognition. We then pretend these toys eat gumball candy that matches the fidget spinner, and they transform again to action figures. Finally, the action figures grow into giant superhero toys, then shrink down. Finally, we use the words "Smallest", "Small", "Big", and "Biggest" for each hero toy transformation, to help toddlers learn about sizes.

The fascination with gangster movies has been immense worldwide. On this side of the Atlantic, several gangster films have left giant footprints on the sands of time. Films like DEEWAAR [Yash Chopra], DHARMATMA [Feroz Khan], NAYAKAN [Mani Ratnam], ANGAAR [Shashilal Nair], PARINDA [Vidhu Vinod Chopra], AGNEEPATH [Mukul Anand], SATYA and COMPANY [Ramgopal Varma], VAASTAV [Mahesh Manjrekar], GANGSTER [Anurag Basu], D [Vishram Sawant] and SHOOTOUT AT LOKHANDWALA [Apoorva Lakhia] have tremendous recall value to this day.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI recreates an era that so many of us have left behind and for those who arrived on this planet post 80s, I am sure, they must have visited the era through some medium or the other, mainly movies and internet or during their academic careers.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI is not part of history, but it attempts to portray on celluloid tales that are now considered legendary, that continue to make news to this date. Of course, the disclaimer claims that it bears no resemblance to a particular person, but you can’t help but draw parallels with real-life characters. It could be a coincidence, though!
ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI is a fascinating story that talks of how the mafia came into force for the first time in Mumbai. A thriller that depicts the crime scenario in Mumbai during the 70s and 80s. The rise to power of two young boys, in different age-groups, who grew up to ‘rule’ the streets of Mumbai.
Since there’s tremendous speculation in the media that ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI chronicles the lives of Haji Mastan and Dawood Ibrahim, the curiosity to watch the film increases manifold. Of course, I am no one to comment if it’s actually based on their lives or merely borrows a few incidents from their lives or is pure fiction, but as a cinematic experience, I couldn’t help getting transported to the bygone era, getting sucked into a world I had no clue of.
Besides the gangster chapter, one enjoys this film also because of its riveting drama and the power play. It could’ve been set anywhere, in the corporate world, in politics, in the film industry. Anywhere. The rise and subsequent fall of the King and the emergence of the Prince as the super power is what makes this film a compelling watch. The icing on the cake is the magical and lilting song compositions that are juxtaposed so beautifully in the goings-on. On the sidelines of the power play, a game of hearts is being played and that’s what makes ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI a wholesome movie experience.
Final word? ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI is not to be missed. Set everything aside this coming weekend and watch this one. Strongly recommended!
The film, set primarily in 1970s Mumbai, follows the rise of Sultan Mirza [Ajay Devgn] and the conflict that ensues, when his protégé Shoaib Khan [Emraan Hashmi] challenges his supremacy and usurps power to rule the murky underbelly of Mumbai.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI is a power-packed drama that makes you thirst for more. You rewind to an era of romance, smuggling, cabaret and mafia, but director Milan Luthria and writer Rajat Aroraa ensure that there’s no sleaze or bloodshed-n-gore. In fact, there’s hardly any violent sequence in the movie, except for one when Ajay hammers a cop during a naaka-bandi.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI is not a biopic, but narrates the story through the eyes of a police officer [Randeep Hooda], who traces the changing face of the Mumbai underworld. The screenplay encompasses several moments that may compel you to draw parallels with real life, but talking strictly from the movie-going point of view, it satiates you completely. In fact, the writing is cohesive, smart and watertight and there’s never a dull moment. Besides, there’s no time to think whether it’s factual or loosely based on someone’s life or a work of fiction.
As I look back and recall the movie, a number of sequences flash across my mind. Note the sequence when Ajay divides the city amongst gangsters… The train sequence at the very start… The introduction of Emraan Hashmi’s character… Randeep Hooda’s landing on a film set and confiscating the equipment… The subsequent sequence, when Randeep is framed for accepting bribe… The romantic moments between Emraan and Prachi in the jewellery shop… Emraan starting his business and the confrontation that ensues between Ajay and Randeep… The showdown between Ajay and Emraan, with Ajay slapping Emraan in full public view… The conclusion to the story is equally novel. It stays in your memory and sets you thinking.
On the flipside, the story begins with Randeep attempting suicide, but the writer should’ve cited the reason that prompted him to take that drastic step. Sure, there’s a mention at the start, but it doesn’t register well. Also, you are keen to know the chain of events that drove Randeep to suicide. Also, the pace slackens in the middle of the second hour, but picks up dramatically when Ajay returns from Delhi and confronts Emraan. Besides, how I wish the film had a shorter, mass appealing Hindi title to attract more eyeballs and a big jump in footfalls [at single screens and smaller centres mainly] for a mass appealing subject like this.
This is director Milan Luthria’s best work to date, no two opinions on that. Recreating the bygone era is tough and the director, the writer and the art director [Nitin Chandrakant Desai] deserve brownie points for giving the film that authentic feel. In fact, the film wears a chic retro look throughout. Even otherwise, Milan’s handling of the subject material is exemplary. This film is sure to catapult him to the top league. Rajat Aroraa’s screenplay is powerful and engaging. The writer marries heavy-duty drama and subtle and delicate emotions beautifully. I would like to make a special note of the dialogue, also penned by Rajat Aroraa, which are simply fantastic. In fact, the dialogue writing is such it elevates even an ordinary sequence to great levels. One rarely comes across such potent dialogue in today’s times.
Pritam’s music is another ace. Injecting songs and that too a terrific soundtrack in a gangster film is tough. He did it in GANGSTER. He does it again in ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI. ‘Pee Loon’, ‘Tum Jo Aaye’ and the remix of APNA DESH track are super compositions, which are also placed appropriately in the plotline. Cinematography [Aseem Mishra] captures the look to perfection. Akiv Ali’s editing is sharp.
ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI is embellished with fantastic performances. Ajay Devgn is splendid as Sultan. The actor had enacted a similar role in COMPANY, but it must be said that his interpretation is so different in ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI. He adds so much depth to the character, which only goes to prove his range and versatility. This is, without a trace of doubt, Ajay’s finest work so far. Emraan Hashmi is brilliant as the power greedy, wildly ambitious rebel. He plays the dark character to perfection. He’s incredible in the penultimate moments of the film in particular. Besides carrying the look to perfection, Emraan is sure to break-free from the lover boy, serial kisser image with this film.
Kangna Ranaut is extremely natural and performs very well. Also, she brings so much of sensuality and glamour to her character [an actress of the 70s]. In fact, Ajay and Kangna make a wonderful on-screen pair. Prachi Desai is a bundle of talent who proves her mettle yet again. She’s proficient in emotional scenes and sizzles in the BOBBY song-sequence. Besides, the chemistry between Emraan and Prachi is exciting. Randeep Hooda is top notch. Even though the film belongs to Ajay and Emraan, Randeep makes his presence felt with a powerful performance. This film should prove to be the turning point in his career.
Avtar Gill [as Home Minister] is good. Naved Aslam [as Patrick, Ajay's trusted lieutenant] is perfect. Mehul Bhojak [as Emraan's friend Javed] is competent. Ravi Khanwilkar [as Vardhan] is satisfactory. Gauhar Khan sizzles in the remix track.
On the whole, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MUMBAAI is an extremely well-made film that lingers in your memory. The realism coupled with stellar direction, power-packed writing, exceptional performances and ear-pleasing tunes are its trump cards. An outstanding cinematic experience!
For Kangna Ranaut, year 2010 is proving to be rather experimental. After being oddly paired with Ajay Devgn in Ekta Kapoor’s Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai, Kangna has now been paired with none other than Salman Khan.
According to sources, Salman Khan has cast Kangna Ranaut in his first maiden production. The film will be directed by Mahesh Manjrekar and will have Salman playing the lead. It’s surprising that instead of casting Katrina Kaif or perhaps her look-alike Zarine Khan, Salman has chosen Kangna.
From her days at Vishesh Films (Gangster, Woh Lamhe), Kangna has indeed come a long way. A few days ago, as we reported, she signed the Sanjay Dutt production Rascals. Her latest catch, Salman Khan’s untitled production, is definitely a big accomplishment.
Talking about Salman casting Kangna, the source said, “Salman and Manjrekar wanted someone who could emote very strongly and look glamorous too.” Her 12 different hairdos in Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai, should take care of the glamour part.
When contacted, Mahesh Manjrekar confirmed that he is working on a film, which will be produced by Salman. “The film will have a lot of elements. It will be a hard-hitting film with its fair share of comedy,” he said.
Hesitant about divulging more details on the film, Manjrekar clarified that the project is at a very nascent stage right now. He said, “It is too early to talk about it since we are still working out a few details. The picture will be clear in the next five days.”
Firstly, Sanjay Dutt and Mahesh Manjrekar are friends again. It happened in Sri Lanka at a recent awards event where Dutt hugged his old friend warmly and said, “Even if we don’t do a film together at least let’s meet up like old times.”
Matters moved quickly from that point of reconciliation. And now Dutt and Manjrekar have decided to revive Ek Anokhi Prem Kahani — their dream project about a blind girl and a grotesquely disfigured man. Dutt and Manjrekar were the thickest of friends who collaborated on a series of films from Vaastav to Viruddh. Then Manjrekar backed off because he did not see eye-to-eye with Dutt on the company the actor kept. And their ambitious project remained on the backburner. They reconnected when Dutt requested his filmmaker friend to do a small role in Lamhaa. Says Manjrekar, “Ek Anokhi Prem Kahani was planned with Sanju and Kareena right after she made her debut in Refugee. She projected a pristine beauty and innocence that I needed to play up against Sanju’s character. Though Kareena has matured in 10 years, I find the same quality of unspoilt beauty and grace in her. Sanju also has aged wonderfully. To me they still work as the characters in my love story.”
The filmmaker feels the pair has never been tried before and has a certain crackling currency about it. Now all Dutt and Kareena need to do is find the time to co-ordinate their dates.
The Kashmir issue is the most persistent and complicated issue ever since India got independence, especially after 1989. Naturally any crisis catches the eyes of filmmakers and Kashmir problem was no exception. However, many films failed to give a true account of the problem and at such a point, Rahul Dholakia comes up with Lamhaa which promises to present the ‘untold story of Kashmir’. To an extent, the storyline is untold at least on celluloid but those closely or even remotely following the problems of the valley, Lamhaa offers nothing new. Still, a good direction would have helped but very unfortunately, Lamhaa is badly executed. A great chance gone totally waste!
The story of the movie: Vikram (Sanjay Dutt) is sent to Kashmir by the Military Intelligence to investigate the possible destructive plan that is likely to create havoc in the state. After reaching Srinagar, he assumes the identity of Gul Jehangir. On the same day, Haji (Anupam Kher), a popular separatist leader, survives attack by a suicide bomber but his close aide, Shabbir is killed. Aziza (Bipasha Basu), Haji’s aggressive and fierce protégé wants to know who is behind the blast and sets on a trial. Vikram aka Gul realizes that there might be a link between the blast and the possible destruction and starts investigating. Since both Gul and Aziza were aiming for the same goal, they team up. Soon, Gul finds out that the entire conspiracy is far deeper than expected and a lot of top politicians, powerbrokers, cops and ISI agents are just playing with feelings of lakhs of Kashmiris and are soon going to do something destructive.
There is no doubt that Lamhaa has a great story to tell. However, Lamhaa disappoints simply because it tries to pack too much in 2 hours. There are lots of characters, conflicts and sub-plots. The narrative is extremely fast-paced which doesn’t help as viewers don’t get gripped and absorbed into the story totally. What stays after leaving the theatre are just a few well-shot individualistic scenes.
The relevation of the destructive attack ever on Kashmir was lame. The climax should have been nail-biting for such a film but it wasn’t. Also showing Sanjay Dutt retired and drunk towards the end wasn’t justified at all.
Every actor gives an impressive performance. The script might be the worst but even in such situations, Sanjay Dutt never disappoint. The same happens here! The actor gives a convincing performance and he looked brilliant in his rugged look. Bipasha Basu comes up with one of the finest performances of her career. It is evident that she has worked and was completely in her character. Same goes for Kunal Kapoor who gives a terrific performance. He has a natural Kashmiri look that aided him to give a convincing performance. It is really sad that such a fine actor isn’t getting enough roles. Shernaz Patel was the best performer of the film although she had a miniscule role. Hers was the only track that actually moves you. Anupam Kher as usual was excellent. Murli Sharma (Dhruv Raina) and Rajesh Khera (Parvez) leaves a mark. Yuri was good as the ISI guy. Vipin Sharma, Vishwajeet Pradhan, Ehsaan Khan, Mahesh Manjrekar and the rest play their part well.
Mithoon’s music was soulful. Madhno and Salaam Zindagi were the most beautiful songs. Sanjoy Chowdhury’s background score was brilliant and lifts many scenes. James Fowlds’ cinematography was miserable. The constant shaking of camera even in non-confrontational scenes doesn’t work. Wonder why the makers opted for a foreign cinematographer when our desi DOPs do such a great job! However, the locations were terrific and it was great to see a film on Kashmir actually being shot in the valley (unlike the rest which are shot in Manali and its surroundings)! Jaaved-Aejaz’ action scenes were topnotch. Ashmith Kunder and Akshay Mohan’s editing made the film crispier than required.
Sai Kabir and Ashwath Bhatt’s dialogues were sharp. Raghav Dhar and Rahul Dholakia write a script that was simply a letdown. With such a fantastic plot in hand, they could have come up with a brilliant film. Moreover, Dholakia’s direction worsened things. Hence, the film, inspite of dealing with a hard-hitting issue fails to create an impact. It is shocking that a person who did a great job with Parzania disappointed in such a manner with Lamhaa! Mr Dholakia, hope to see you back in form in your next flick, Society!
On the whole, Lamhaa is a letdown. Although boasting of a great plot, the haphazard execution spoils the show. What a waste of a golden chance!
During the showcasing of LAMHAA at the recently held I.I.F.A. in Sri Lanka, I was compelled to ask director Rahul Dholakia about the catch line of the film: ‘The untold story of Kashmir’. Obviously, I was curious. What was Dholakia going to narrate that we, the viewers, hadn’t witnessed in films earlier or read in newspapers or watched on news channels? Dholakia gave a convincing response, justifying the catch line, but obviously not revealing much about the film.
As LAMHAA unfolds, you realize that Dholakia may’ve borrowed a few incidents from life, but as it moves forward, it comes across as a typical Bollywood enterprise that harps on being real, but ends up being a masala film that we have witnessed over and over again. The catch line, in my individualistic opinion, is quite misleading.
Dholakia seems to have researched extensively on the issue and LAMHAA does boast of some razor-sharp moments, but the viewer is keen to have an insider’s viewpoint on Kashmir, something that we haven’t read/seen [on news channels/films] earlier, which LAMHAA just doesn’t provide.
The Military Intelligence gets a whiff of a plot that is likely to disrupt and possibly paralyze Kashmir. Vikram [Sanjay Dutt] is sent to investigate this highly confidential mission and he assumes the identity of Gul Jehangir. The same day that he lands in the valley, Haji [Anupam Kher], a top separatist leader, survives a blast. Is there a connection between the blast and the operation?
To solve this conundrum, Vikram teams up with Aziza [Bipasha Basu], Haji’s young, aggressive and outspoken protégé. The intensity of their beliefs and their will to survive against all odds creates a special bond between them. They embark together on a journey to uncover the truth.
First things first! LAMHAA has been filmed in Kashmir and you’re awe-struck by its beauty, with DoP James Fowlds doing a splendid job in capturing the scenic locales on celluloid. The constant shaking of the camera also gives a real feel. Unfortunately, LAMHAA, though controversial in nature, merely touches the tip of the issue, instead of going all-out and narrating a story that offers reasons and perhaps, a solution to the crisis.
The problem clearly lies in its scripting, the written material [screenplay: Raghav Dhar, Rahul Dholakia]. Like I pointed out earlier, Dholakia should’ve stuck to realism, instead of trying to strike a balance between realism and make-believe. The viewer is told at the very outset, and also at regular intervals, that ‘something big [read destructive] is going to occur’. But the entire conspiracy comes across as too trivial during the final moments of the film and therefore, the impact is missing.
Honestly, LAMHAA comes across as a disjointed effort, in terms of writing. It’s more of a collage of several isolated incidents, which explains why the screenplay lacks the power to keep you engaged. Sure, a few sequences are attention grabbing, but showing the heroic side of Sanjay Dutt [rescuing Bipasha all the while - from the cops, from Rajesh Khera's henchmen, from a lecherous Yashpal Sharma] appears very filmy. Even the finale – Sanju busting the conspiracy – comes across as child’s play.
One expects a lot from Dholakia, but he lets you down completely in LAMHAA. The politicians wanting a bigger piece of pie or children getting trained for jehad or their bodies being stuffed with bombs is not an eye-opener anymore. What one is keen to know is the mindset of Kashmiris, which, frankly, this film doesn’t really project. In the end, if you recall the visuals, not the content, it means something is seriously wrong with the film and LAMHAA, sadly, is right intentions gone wrong. Even the dialogue [Sai Kabir, Ashwath Bhatt], like the screenplay writing, tries to strike a balance between real and filmy. Mithoon’s music is easy on the ears, but acts as a speed breaker in the narrative.
Sanjay Dutt tries hard to look the character, but I just couldn’t connect with it. The rugged look, the sunglasses and the trendy attire made me feel that Sanju had strolled into the sets from an ad film shoot. Bipasha, again, doesn’t look her part, although I must add that she has put in a lot of effort to stay true to her character. The sequence when she’s attacked by the women workers of Anupam Kher’s political party is simply brilliant.
Kunal Kapoor is royally sidelined in the first hour, but has a few interesting scenes in the second half. His speech in the finale is flat and devoid of the required emotions. Anupam Kher is the lone actor who actually looks the character he has been assigned to portray.
Mahesh Manjrekar is wasted. Ditto for Yashpal Sharma. Vipin Sharma is effective. Jyoti Dogra stands out. Murli Sharma is perfect. Shernaz Patel is decent. Rajesh Khera, Yuri Suri, Vishwajeet Pradhan, Asif Basra, Denzil Smith and Ehsaan Khan are okay in their respective parts.
Mahesh Manjrekar is exploring newer territories. Literally! The talented director, who has so far made films in Hindi and Marathi languages, has now decided to make his first film in Bengali. The film will be a remake of Manjrekar’s blockbuster Marathi hit ME SHIVAJIRAJE BHOSALE BOLTOY and will star Mithun Chakraborty in the role that Sachin Khedekar had essayed in the Marathi smash hit.
“He [Manjrekar] has a 3-film deal with Dar Pictures and the Bengali film will be made by Dar,” Arun Rangachari, Chairman of Dar Group, confirms the news. But does Manjrekar know Bengali, to do justice to the Bengali version? “Oh yes, he understands Bengali well. Besides, we have Mithun-da to guide us,” Rangachari states. Manjrekar had essayed the pivotal role in the Marathi version himself, but who will enact his role in the Bengali version? “Let that be a suspense,” Rangachari smiles.
After promising Mahesh Manjrekar he would watch Marathi film Shikshanachya Aaicha Gho, Salman backed out at the last minute
Although Salman Khan has agreed to act in the Hindi version of director Mahesh Manjrekar’s Marathi film Shikshanachya Aaicha Gho, the director is finding it difficult to pin down the elusive star to show him the film. Manjrekar arranged for a special screening of the film only for Salman, but the star failed to turn up.
Salman heard about this Marathi film, which caused uproar because of the pot shots it takes at the current education system, and jumped at the offer of starring in the Hindi version. Apparently, the film even made some schools revive some parts of their curriculum.
While the powerful Marathi version was made on a shoestring budget, the Hindi version is expected to be made on a more lavish budget and will be more hard-hitting. Buzz is Salman wants the Hindi version of Shikshanachya Aaicha Gho to be the most definitive film highlighting the loopholes in our education system, on par with the impact Aamir Khan made with 3 Idiots.
Sensing the high interest level of the star, Manjrekar was even more eager to do the remake as soon as possible. As the logical next step, Manjrekar wanted Salman to watch the original film.
Despite trying for months, the star was unable to wriggle out of the shooting schedule of his home production Dabangg in Wai. So rather than taking a print of Shikshanachya … to Wai, Manjrekar thought it was better to wait for Salman to see the film in Mumbai.
Manjrekar’s efforts did pay off as Salman agreed to watch the film in the third week of April. The director, who was busy with the marketing and release of his latest film City Of Gold, quickly set aside everything to arrange for a special screening of the film in a suburban theatre.
A source says, “Mahesh made it very clear to Salman that the screening was being held exclusively for him and that no other guests were invited. Since Mahesh had to book the theatre and be present for the screening despite a hectic schedule for promoting City Of Gold, he also double checked the date, time and venue with Salman.”
However, Salman decided to play truant at the last minute. “Despite knowing that the screening was being held only for him, Salman failed to turn up. Instead, he sent a message through one of his staff members saying he wasn’t feeling well. Mahesh was naturally very disappointed,” adds the source.
Manjrekar doesn’t deny the incident and says, “However, it’s all been sorted out. Salman has promised to watch the film this week on a DVD.”
A source close to Salman defends the star. “I don’t know how Salman agreed to watch Mahesh’s film. The truth is he never watches films. Never. Not even his own films. Even when Wanted was about to be made, he had refused to watch the Tamil original Pokiri.”
After the good reviews he got for playing a rebellious boy from the chawls in Mahesh Manjrekar’s City of Gold, Karan Patel was flooded with slum-boy roles which he has been firmly rejecting.
Luckily for the Ekta Kapoor protégé, he has now been signed for another film by Manjrekar in which he’ll be playing a white-collar executive. The film is a Hindi remake of the 2006 Maatichya Chuli which Manjrekar wrote.
Karan says he prepared for his role in City of Gold by completely disconnecting from his upper class lifestyle and living in slums. He says, “I don’t belong to the slums but to play Naru in City Of Gold I had to live for months in a real chawl before we shot the film. I had to work on my physique and language. When I took up the role, Mahesh warned me I’d have to completely change my lifestyle. I was even cut off from family and friends.”
Karan says he learnt colloquial Marathi in the chawls from the boys who feature in the film. “These are boys from actual mill-workers’ families. I plan to stay in touch with them. I don’t think I can ever be the affluent Gujju boy I used to be. Not after playing this role,” adds Karan.

Home » Featured, Miscellaneous, People & Places » What Happened to Criminal Complaint on Elvin Penner?
Former Minister of State Elvin Penner was thrown out of Cabinet in September 2013 after having been found to facilitate jailed Korean businessman Won Hong Kim with a Belizean passport and nationality without meeting the requirements. This was to unsuccessfully, get him out of a Taiwanese jail. These and other misadventures between April of 2011 and September of 2013 earned him a starring role in the Auditor General’s Special Audit on the Immigration and Nationality Department, released to the Government earlier this year. On Wednesday, the Senate’s six-member Select Committee will begin questioning persons named and involved in the audit beginning with the Auditor General herself, Dorothy Bradley. But it still rankles many that Penner seemed to escape criminal charges. A private prosecution brought by Jihad McLaren and Geovannie Brackett failed in the Supreme Court because they were unable to persuade the Chief Justice to force Commissioner of Police Allen Whylie to turn over the Department’s investigative file. Attorney Kareem Musa, who acted for Brackett and McLaren, has finally seen part of the investigative file on Penner. He called on Director of Public Prosecutions Cheryl-Lynn Vidal as well as Prime Minister and substantive Minister of Home Affairs Dean Barrow, to turn the heat up on the ex-Minister of State. But eyebrows were raised today when Immigration Minister Godwin Hulse reported that a formal complaint has been made to Police by Immigration.
“It is not for the Minister; it’s for the Director of Immigration, and the Director of Immigration had done that, you know, a formal complaint was made to the Police.”
“I am aware that many witnesses gave statements; I have seen some of the statements. Unfortunately, they provided with the insignificant witnesses, but I can tell you it is a very bulky file, and the important ones that will incriminate Elvin Penner were not provided to me, with good reason. But I can say to you that it is a bulky file, and whatever request the D.P.P. made – I think the D.P.P. has an onus as well, to continue to follow up this matter; this is a huge, national interest matter, and we cannot allow this to just be swept under the rug, as per usual with this Government. And so the D.P.P. has to follow up with the Commissioner – if she made requests in 2014, two years have gone; it would be good to renew that request and say, “Mr. Commissioner, did you get that information that I requested of you?” Because we cannot just sit by idly and allow the Commissioner to go on national T.V. and say, “I don’t watch the news,” or “I did not get a copy of the Auditor General’s Report” – everybody has a copy of the Auditor General’s Report. So he cannot continue to get away with that. And the Prime Minister, no less, is the Minister of Police, and he should be the one responsible now to ensure that the Commissioner does his job, and if he is not doing his job, he should get rid of him.”
They should arrest the commissioner of police for not doing his job. Almost 3 years have gone and Penner is still free. Where is the justice in Belize?
After you look at his illegal immigration dealings, take a look at his shady land acquisitions. I hear he has 1,000 acres in the Pine Ridge. Wonder how he got that?
We normally see Magistrates trying cases and handing down decisions. Today we met them in a different environment. The Judiciary of Belize in conjunction with the Commonwealth Secretariat, the Commonwealth Magistrates’ and Judges’ Association are hosting a two day seminar for the magistracy. The objective of the seminar is to provide magistrates with the opportunity to discuss issues they confront in the dispensation of justice. News Five’s Andrea Polanco reports.
Today magistrates of the six judicial districts gathered at the Radisson Hotel to discuss major issues they face in handing down justice in Belize. Chief Magistrate, Margaret Babb McKenzie says that the magistrates face numerous challenges everyday from financial, to staffing, to security, which impacts their work:
“The department continues to be faced with many challenges which include logistical and financial constraints. Working conditions; as litigation grows in amount and complexities, our courts have to grapple with existing backlog of cases, delay and inadequate resources. There can be no doubt that the use of technology in our courts would enhance court administration allowing cases to be disposed of within a shorter period; thereby allowing judicial officers and court staff to be more effective in their time management, in giving better service to the public and legal profession. Presently, we are not in a position to have the technology that can address some of the concerns that face the system of a daily basis.”
“Today we shall discuss procedure, evidence, some of the areas of law that we frequently deal and perhaps some of the general public’s perspective. My advice is this, aim at being correct about the evidence and law if you are a first instance judge or a magistrate. Avoid guessing, read the applicable provisions in the criminal court act, the indictable procedure act, the inferior courts act, the summary jurisdiction act, the family courts act and families and children act to confirm what you want to do. It does not matter whether you have read it the day before or a hundred times before, that is how you get it right each time the question arises. Then generally read the area of the law that the case presents to you.”
In order to administrate justice and good governance, Chief Magistrate says that it will take proper resourcing of all the bodies involved:
“The Magistrate courts are in my view ready and able to provide the highest standard of criminal justice but cannot do it alone. All the other agencies like the police and the D.D.P. office must be properly resourced. Prosecutors must likely be highly trained in order to properly present their cases. Once these agencies are properly resourced, the administration of justice in the magistrate’s courts will be something we can all be proud of.”
The workshop continues on Saturday with presentations on Sentencing, Witness protection and discussion of establishing a Magistrates’ Association. Reporting for News Five, I am Andrea Polanco.
Discussions are being led by Justice Ingrid Mangatal of Jamaica, Chief Magistrate Margaret Ramsay-Hale of Cayman Islands, District Judge Shamim Qureshi and Paul Norton of England and Wales.
Today a man convicted of trying to smuggle marijuana inside the Belize Central Prison escaped becoming an inmate there after he was ordered to pay a fine. Twenty-four year old Justin Richards was caught in February 2012 with one hundred and sixty-one grams of cannabis stashed inside two Sunny and Tan buns he was trying to get into the prison. In Court this morning, Richards changed his previous not guilty plea to guilty and threw himself on the mercy of the court. He told Senior Magistrate Sharon Frazer that he has to take care of his grandmother and pleaded with her for a fine instead of jail time. So for his conviction for drug trafficking Richards was ordered to pay two thousand dollars by the end of October. If he does not do so he will serve three years in prison.
Any guesses on how he will pay his fine. Yap, sell more drugs. This drugs epidemic is so bad. Drugs is robbing us of a whole generation.
Don,t these people realize that their drug use is what gets most people into prison in the first place. Just say no to drugs and your life will be better.

Representatives of employer organisations and trade unions assist the Ministry for Labour, through a Working Conditions Steering Committee (COCT).
Its action is relayed to the field by the occupational health inspectorate and the labour inspectorate.
Social insurance is in charge of defining prevention measures and resources and guaranteeing compensation to victims of occupational accidents and diseases. The Occupational Risk Directorate of Social Security (CNAMTS/DRP) implements the occupational accidents and diseases prevention policy decided by trade unions and employer organisations. These organisations are heavily involved in the management of the occupational accidents and diseases branch of Social Security through the occupational accidents and disease commission in particular (CAT-MP).
At regional level, it acts through the Prevention Services of Social Security (CARSAT and CGSS in overseas departements). These are in direct contact with the companies and in particular with the occupational health services out in the regions.
INRS collaborates with the State and all prevention bodies to implement the national occupational risk prevention policy. Its activities are targeted at employees and companies, particularly those falling under the general Social Security scheme.
Company heads are the main prevention partners in the firm. According to regulations, they must guarantee the health and safety of workers by implementing appropriate measures (depending on their risk assessment). To do so, they must seek all technical assistance and advice necessary.
The Health, Safety and Working Conditions Committee (CHSCT), which is the forum for discussions among managers and workers. The CHSCT is in charge, in particular, of analysing risks to which the employees are exposed and proposing to the employer the measures deemed necessary. It is chaired by the manager or their representative and is made up of staff delegates. The occupational physician attends meetings in an advisory capacity. The labour inspector and agents from the prevention services of Social Security at regional level are also invited to attend;
Health and safety specialists. In some firms, the manager may assign a person specifically in charge of occupational safety and health matters. The title and function of this health and safety specialist vary with the firms - safety engineers, safety coordinators, etc;
Occupational health services. Occupational health services, whether in-house or contracted, are in charge of medical surveillance of employees (with regular visits) and monitoring of working conditions (by studying workstations and conditions of exposure to risks).
The Food Industry Conference was held in order to investigate the relationship between food and industry, and started on World Science Day for Peace and Development in Islamic Azad University, Science and Research branch.
According to a report from IAU Public Relations, Dr. Hosseini, general manager for monitoring and evaluating food and beverages of Food and Drug Administration related to Iran’s ministry of Health and Medical Education, stated that based on statistics, 800 million people worldwide suffer from obvious malnutrition, while 2 billion are afflicted with hidden hunger - a fact that shows the significance of food quality.
“Iran has favorable conditions for producing agriculture, livestock, and marine raw materials. The country has about 50 million hectares of fertile agricultural lands, of which 20 million hectares yield crops. 100 million tons of food raw material are produced every year”, he added. “Appropriate production increases the value of food nutrients and decreases waste, which ultimately raises added value.”
Dr. Hosseini also pointed to the public attention on healthy food and stated that producing high-quality foodstuffs depends on factors such as its producers, transportation, keeping and storage conditions, and the main requirement for determining these is arriving at technical and health principles and standards.
Alireza Morovat-pour, secretary of Iran’s Industrial Bread Society and head of Nanavaran Company, Mohammad Reza Shafeiee-nia, secretary of Iranian Food Sciences and Technology Association and the head of Jihad Esteghlal, Dr. Seyyed Mahdi Seyyedin, faculty member of the department of Food Industry of IAU’s S&R branch, and Dr. Mehrdad Ghavami, head of the food industry engineering department at IAU’s S&R branch also participated in this conference.

Another great "character" reader is Barbara Rosenblat doing the Amelia Peabody Series by Elizabeth Peters (mysteries with archealogists in Egypt in the early 1900's). I heard an interview with both the reader and the author which was VERY interesting. Peters said that she had Rosenblat's voice characterizations in her head as she was writing the subsequent books ever since the first recording, and that the characters had become a kind of joint creation between reader and author.
Barbara Rosenblat's readiings of the Amelia Peabody Series are among Recorded Books, LLC's bestselling titles. I forgot to mention that there are sometimes "extras" to the Recorded Books recordings. For example, in the Patrick Tull narration of Chapter 1 of "Post Captain" by Patrick O'Brian, the narrator actually sings the ditty about the naval reaction to peace -- the lack of opportunities for promotion and what the admiral, captain, lieutenant, and midshipman plan to do (and also how the doctor will go set up as mountebank in a country fair). I've never heard that in the other audio recordings (by Robert Hardy, etc.) of this work.
I was given the Harry Potter first book very early on as an audiobook after I had read the book about 5 times from my parents. I was the only one pronouncing 'Hermione' correct for ages at my school!
I'm glad my parents encouraged me to read and also listen to audio since I found it a very relaxing thing and still do!
My daughter (9) plays her audiobooks on a little Rio Nitrus while she is doing art, and other little projects in her room (she does a great deal of cutting and pasting of stuff to create art montages, etc) and I am not sure whether the books are something to do while she is "working" or whether the "work" is something to do while she is listening!
I've got Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as read by Stephen Fry. He is excellent, and while so is Jim Dale (I recall Dale's reading of Lucius Malfoy [Draco's father] as reminding me of the marvelous voice of James Mason), I prefer Fry.
But, I'm a fan of Stephen Fry. I enjoyed him in the Jeeves & Wooster TV series. And I've read some of his books, and listened to his book, The Hippopotamus, which was read by Stephen Fry. The Hippopotamus is one of my very favorite audio books.
What really annoys me is that Hugh Laurie took on an American accent for his new TV show. I am not sure why this bothers me, but it is kind of like Mel Gibson purposefully taking on an American accent at a certain point in his career in his everyday speech. It makes no sense. British and Australian accents sell in the US.
Agreed, the Jeeves & Wooster TV series is excellent. If you haven't already come across it, let me point you to this web site for the Granada TV series. They used to have sound samples from a CD, "The World of Jeeves and Wooster", that was issued in the early days of the series and immediately disappeared. Alas, these have long since been removed, so you you will not be able to hear Fry and Laurie do separate songs from the television series (Minnie the Moocher, etc.) but there is still a lot of good content there.
My favorite narrator for Wodehouse is Alexander Spencer, but his recordings are not available from Audible, or through NetLibrary, either. If these are not available through your library, the easiest way to get these (in the U.S.) is through Borders -- not through Recorded Books. Most of these titles are still only sold as audio tapes, although Recorded Books has just started offering these for sale as CDs to libraries.
My favorite narrator for Wodehouse is Alexander Spencer, but his recordings are not available from Audible, or through NetLibrary, either.
I've listened to quite a few Wodehouse books from Audible. They've got Jonathan Cecil, Frederick Davidson and Ian Carmichael as narrators. I like them all, and lean to J. Cecil as the best, but the others are really just as good. I've never had the pleasure of any Wodehouse books narrated by Alexander Spencer. If he's better than Cecil, Davidson and Carmichael, he's really, really good.
I've listened to quite a few Wodehouse books from Audible. They've got Jonathan Cecil, Frederick Davidson and Ian Carmichael as narrators.
I've listened to all of these narrators, and several others -- some of whom are on the Audible site, but others of whom (Timothy Carlton, Martin Jarvis, Simon Cadell, etc.) are not. Of the Audible readers, I prefer Jonathan Cecil, but I do like Alexander Spencer's rendition better. This is probably individual preference. Certainly this Washington Post article writer seems to have a different opinion. (And I can't detect a "faint Scottishness" about Spencer's accent -- not even when he renders Jeeves speaking about "the poet Burns" who wrote in "the North British dialect".)
The one limitation is that Alexander Spencer only reads the Jeeves and Wooster stories. My favorites among the other short stories are probably the Talking Tape Company cassettes by Timothy Carlton reading "Anselm Gets His Chance", "Mulliner's Buck-U-Uppo", and "Lord Emsworth and the Girlfriend". ("The Clicking of Cuthbert" is not bad, either). (This is/was a UK company, and the tapes are now out of print). Simon Cadell's reading of various "Golf Stories" (on the BBC label) are also quite good.
We should probably have another thread -- about which audiobooks you replay the most. This is not necessarily the same as the audiobooks you recommend, because there are many great audiobooks that you don't want to revisit frequently. Call it the "Play It Again, Sam" (PIAS) index. Some of these will be like "comfort food". And just to show that not all of these entries will be P.G. Wodehouse, I'll list a completely different title that fits into this category -- the L.A. Theatreworks production of "The Odd Couple" with Nathan Lane and David Paymer. This is available on Audible, and does bear repeat listening. YMMV
And how...On Monday, Laurie won a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a TV Drama. Though, to be fair, the GGs are voted upon by members of the Hollywood Foreign Press, who aren't exactly Americans.
I've only watched the show a couple of times and I find his American accent to be glib and irritating. It approximates the goofy voice Brits do when they're attempting a deliberately condescending imitation of us Yanks. Contrast that with, say, Heath Ledger in "Brokeback Mountain," who you never for one second doubt is anything but 100% redblooded American. Rachel Griffiths did a similarly effective job during her run on "Six Feet Under."
Right, Brits tend to make their American accent to nasal and high pitched, kind of a stereotype. I can usually spot a Brit doing American. I wonder if American actors do any better with British accents.
I think Jude Law did a pretty good job as well in Cold Mountain. I think if they are given the chance to do a "stronger" American dialect such as one of the southern accents, it is easier than doing a fairly flat "mid-American".
Barbara Rosenblat and George Guidall were written up in a NY Times article about audiobook narrators: "Actors You've Never Heard of Are Becoming the Ones Heard Most" (Jan. 15, 2005). (Last year was a good year for audiobook press coverage). The point of the article was that the qualities required of a good audiobook narrator are often not ones that excellent -- even Oscar winning- -- actors possess. Here's an excerpt:
Excerpted from NY Times (Jan. 15, 2005) Actors You've Never Heard of Are Becoming the Ones Heard Most
She's earned 27 Golden Earphone awards from AudioFile magazine, the recorded-books industry barometer, and five Audies from the Audio Publishers Association, the most awarded to a single narrator. She's recorded more than 400 titles.
Watch Ms. Rosenblat work at the Chelsea studios of Recorded Books, and you get the sense that even an Oscar winner might not be able to pull this off. What screenplay, after all, would require an actress to do what she did during a recent afternoon's recording of ''The Serpent on the Crown,'' the 17th installment of Elizabeth Peters' Amelia Peabody Mysteries series?
Ms. Rosenblat was delivering the dialogue of a handful of characters, most of them men, and was shifting quickly between characters with British, Indian, Arabic, Egyptian, Irish, Austro-Hungarian and Texan accents. Those distinct roles interacted with incredulity, shock, anguish and sarcasm. It was emotion layered on dialect layered on perfect enunciation.
Rosenblat mentions that the difficulty for actors who are reading is that every nuance that they convey with gesture, expression, etc. has to go into the voice. Guidall remarks that many actors tend to overact when reading. The director of operations at Recorded Books, David Markowitz, commented that, "The odds are probably 50-to-1 against a talented actor being a talented reader," with many of them coming alive during dialogue but falling flat during straight narration.
The other reality is that when relatively prominent actors, like Scott Brick, make the cut of accomplished narrators, outfits like Recorded Books, LLC and Books-On-Tape often can't afford to hire them for really lengthy audiobooks. Sometimes publishers will hire one actor for the abridged version and a second (less expensive) actor to read the unabridged version. (I think this may be changing with the increasing popularity and profitability of audiobooks, at least in the view of the big commercial book publishers.)
And yes, it's true that Barbara Mertz (aka Elizabeth Peters) was very taken with Rosenblat's reading, and has written into her contract that Rosenblat read her books.
She also has Ms. Rosenblat, speaking in the British-accented voice of Amelia Peabody, suggesting that callers ''please do'' leave a message on the outgoing message of her answering machine at home.
Well I mostly only have the regular stuff. But I find Stephen Fry excellent at the Harry Potter series. I don't like the Jim Dale (US) versions so much - although I've only heard clips of them. That might be because I'm not american.
My son is playing a Harry Potter video game and I just remembered that Stephen Fry is the "narrator" in those games.
That is very interesting about the actors and readers phenomenon. It really is worth the time to listen to any of the Amelia Peabody books just to hear Rosenblat at work, and most libraries carry at least one of them. The interview with the two of them was at the end of one of the RB, LLC recordings, but I do not remember which one.
An excellent "cast" reading is the "His Dark Materials" series by Phillip Pullman. Young Adult it may be, but wonderfully read/acted. My husband and I rank in up in our top 3 audio books.
They were aiming for a release sometime in "late July or early August". So, assuming they get everything done that they would like to get done for this release and no glaring issues are found in the next playtests, it is reasonable to expect a release within the next 3 to 4 weeks. A message will pop up eventually, relax
When I was playing Squad yesterday some guy said, "he was was on redit and one of the devs stated, "that possibly July 26 which is Tuesday that it might be coming out.". That is a maybe and not a definite!
I know that feel bro. I got decent rig which can handle most of the games - but squad works ... not as good as I think it should. I know that the performace "should" improve but I hear this for very long time and can't see really any progress on this.
Performance won't be fully focused on until late Alpha and Beta, when most content is in, as is with pretty much all games in development. We will only see minor optimizations in this early stage of building the game.
Amd Issues are mainly to do with UE4 needing to put patches out, which they have, 4.11(Implemented in SQ now) and soon the 4.12 patch when released, which has a lot of AMD fixes involved, specifically for the CPU and threading.
I remember seeing a Dev quote somewhere, about how there was a minimal performance hit, with 30 vehicles in a test.
It seems like their gear has the colours of a multicam but the clothing has a marpat colour scheme which looks weird to me.
The strange ATACS like pattern near his butt looks weird as well, does not blend nice with the rest.
I really love the apartment building! Cant wait to see that ingame, it would be nice if the game had a breach door mechanic for clearing rooms.
I think the reason it looks weird to you is because it's not a standard multicam pattern, it's the new Scorpion W2 pattern which is more blotchy and lacks verticle shapes.
Maybe, what bothers me the most is that you see two colour schemes, I dont like it but thats my personal opinion. On other pictures the colours schemes seem to match so maybe I'm just blind. The character models look great I'm just not a big fan of the textures but like I said before its just my opinion.
I wonder how they will change the walking. personally i dont want them to make it slower than it is already but lets see
LakersGround.net :: View topic - If you could undo one which would it be, Nash trade or Movgov/Deng signings
Start of the season I would have said MozDeng, as we may have cashed in on an asset too early because of it. Now, with DLO IMO being ‘damaged goods’ and where we are in the standings, I’d say Nash as that lottery pick would look mighty juicy and likely lay the ground work for a future contender (Ball, Doncic, Ingram, Kuzma, Randle). No doubt if we had the pick, we would have activated the tank after our losing streak.
The pick would make this year a win no matter what direction the season went in terms of W-L record.
Nash trade. Nash probably goes to Toronto without it and the Lakers sign Kyle Lowry. That probably sets off a lot of dominoes where we wouldn't have been rebuilding at all over these past few years. Moz/Deng not happening would've been one of those dominoes.
Hindsight is 20/20 but since we're going through a revisionist history of mistakes-- here are the big ones:
Nash Trade-- ironically, we've yet to pay for it as we've dodged the odds and the hope was that we'd slip into the playoffs and not really ever lose a massive pick, but this seems to the the year we're going to lose a top 7 pick.
Not trading Dwight at the deadline (could have probably gotten that same BK package). The signs were on the wall he was out and Pau was still very capable of playing starting C for us.
Porzingis over DLO-- Obvious one here but KP looks the part of a true superstar, MVP, #1 piece type guy. We apparently loved him but were scurred of blow back and Byron's outdated views.
I still can't believe we let Pau walk for nothing. I'm sure there were lowball offers, but our pride probably didn't let us trade him.
The preferred alternate reality ? Both, by avoiding the Nash trade. It almost certainly would also lead to a future scenario in which signing Deng and Mozgov would never present itself as the best next course.
“These GOAT discussions are fun distractions while sitting around waiting for the pizza to be served.”
Nash and MozDeng didn't require hindsight. They were stupid moves at the time. You don't give up 2 first round draft picks for a 39 year-old player. I don't care if it's Nash, LeBron, or Jordan, you just don't. The Nash stupidity was compounded by the fact that if Phoenix didn't trade him to us, he was going to get signed by either the Knicks or Raptors, and the Suns wouldn't have gotten a damn thing in return. We held the cards and let the Suns bluff us.
If we're really going to revisionist history this thing, we should've told the Suns to (bleep) off, signed Kyle Lowry, and let Kobe ride off into the sunset after the Achilles injury and made this Dwight's team. Then we could've signed LeBron, Carmelo, or Bosh that next offseason like we'd planned on, because Dwight would've brought them. Do we win rings? Possibly. Likely not. But we aren't a lottery team for 5 years, either.
Or, scenario B - embrace the tank, don't try to be "competitive" after Dwight walks - trade Pau after Dwight walks, don't sign guys like Nick Young, Kaman, Lou Will, etc. And we end up with guys like Simmons, KAT, and Embiid or Parker instead of Randle, Russell, and Ingram.
I wanted a Lowry + Ariza FA summer the year of Melo. Understand that it would have meant no high draft picks, but at the time, that wasn't even on my radar.
Moz/Deng signings? I can't understand that today. Probably could have overpaid them (more) for less than 4 years.
The Nash trade. He was too old and came in with a bad back. It was a disaster waiting to happen. That said, the one positive that came out of it is that the Lakers were forced to tank and got high draft picks as a result. I don't think they end up with the high picks they did if that wasn't the case, just as they picked # 7 the year before the protections went into place.
If no Nash trade, then we would have lost one of our 1st rd picks to Orlando for the Dwight Howard trade.
Nash trade as bad as it turned out, I'm still ok with it. We had to keep up with Miami and San Antonio superteams and we still had an MVP level Kobe and all-star Pau... had to try to win it all
The Mozgov or the Deng trade... the length and the miscalculation of future cap ceiling... I'd rather void one of these trade
Absolutely. On one hand, you can say the Lakers as an organization are loyal and respectful to their players, which is probably the look they were going for with Pau and paying Kobe in his later years. But IMO it was a foolish philosophy then, and even more so now in hindsight, purely from a team building and winning standpoint.
There's no loyalty in sports, because guess what - Pau surely didn't give a damn about us when he rejected our contract offer the following summer and bolted for the Bulls. I don't fault him for that, and I wouldn't have faulted the team for trading him earlier when it was clear he had no future here anyway. Our front office was behind the eight ball to begin with that old school mentality, and got lapped by forward thinking teams like the Celtics. At the very least, there's definitely an argument that we could've easily avoided the first two years of this "rebuild" (during which there was literally zero progress made) by being smart rather than sentimental.
Nash trade since the Lakers could still try to win and improve each year while still remain in the lotto. They could have used that scout team to get players like Booker or Myles Turner while not being forced to tank into the top 3. Very hard to shy away from drafting the projected players unless the GM is a visionary
The Nash trade was an effort to get Dr. Buss equal with the Celtics. I hate to be that guy but if you have a problem with that, you are no Laker fan. As we are seeing, Dr. Buss was the Lakers.
I remember that there was a trade discussion involving Bynum for iguadala and filler. Correct me if I’m wrong!
Man, this is what I've been saying for years. That would have been a nasty team that I think would have contended.
"Kobe is a scientific dawg," O'Neal wrote. "He works out every day, practices every day. Most of the other stars are just dawgs, not scientific dawgs. Kobe will always have the edge because of his range and killer instinct."
I wouldn’t undo anything because we likely wouldn’t have ball and Ingram and space for 2 maxes. Every team goes through a rebuilding phase.
I guess it depends if you're just thinking in hindsight or asking what was the bigger mistake at the time.
Can't forget that the Nash deal was part of what made us pre-season title favorites. Also can't forget that Mitch and Jim were looking down the barrel of a gun when they entered 2016 free agency (which was in part because they should have used more of the space to secure assets before that).
Not trading Shaq a year earlier was a mistake. With two years (plus option) of his contract remaining, we likely could have received a better haul for him.
Nash trade. I hated it at the time, and it has haunted us ever since. In fact, I don't think the Mozgov and Deng signings happen if we hadn't already dug ourselves a hole with the Nash trade.
Agree. I wouldn't have been so bad if they didn't give up so much. The guy already wasn't gonna stick around with Phoenix, and he was approaching 40. So they not only give him a 3-year deal but give up 2 first rounders and 2 second-rounders as well? Absolutely awful asset management by the front office.

Lopetegui is under increasing pressure at the European champions after a four-match winless run, during which Madrid have failed to score.
But Butragueno – director of institutional relations at the club – offered the former Spain boss support ahead of Madrid's hosting of Levante in LaLiga on Saturday.
"We have a great technical team. We trust them and we are confident that we will have a good season," he said on Friday.
"Real Madrid always go to win at any field and every time we play it's for the millions of fans around the world."
Madrid are fifth in the table but, given they are kicking off before their rivals this matchday, would jump top with a win over Levante.

It's been a long time I have been using Cheat Engine and I really enjoy it. I have always had trouble finding static addresses and I swear I tried every single tutorial present on both the old and new forums (AOB scan, manually finding pointers offsets, pointer scanner...). I simply can't figure out why I can't find any (or very few) static addresses.
I know most of the people here are asking the exact same questions than I will, and you can be sure I also checked most of these threads, but unfortunately I am still unable to achieve what I want to do.
Just so you know, I will spare you some pain and time : I am a developper, I understand what are pointers and offsets, data structures, static addresses etc. Unfortunately I don't have much knowledge about assembler yet.
Anyway, let's go. I have tried to hack many games with CE but always ended giving up because I simply failed again and again without knowing why. My current target is Slay The Spire.
I successfully wrote an AOB Scan script to find the player gold but failed to do so for both Health and Max Health. Still, I noticed that those values seem to be contained in the same data structure, so I use my gold AOB Scan result with the good offset to point to the right addresses for health.
Here comes the first problem : both the values and addresses are correct, though modifying the value won't change anything in game but if I find the address from a normal scan (which is exactly the same address) the modification works. Strange. Also, the health addresses calculated from the gold address seem to randomly change to another location, so I decide to disable the AOB Scan script and re-enable it to find the new addresses. The addresses are exactly the same ! Very strange.
I start to tell myself that maybe the AOB Scan is not the answer to my problems. I try to manually find the static address and every offset but it is very long and I have never been able to succeed excepted for very simple processes (low-level pointers) and have quickly given up that fastidious method.
I then tried the Pointer Scan method, no luck. From the regular value scan results I found (there are 2 addresses, the GUI value address and the actual variable address), I get 0 results for both of them even after tweaking the depth-levels of the scan. At this point I'm starting to go mad, it even worked sometimes in Terraria, why not here ?
Well, I thought it was time for me to learn how to do real hacking and how to find the (static) address of the player data structure, because eh, if I can get that, I can get almost everything I want. Another failure, I didn't see any static address by dissecting the data structure and I honestly wasn't able to see clearly anything inside the structure excepted the values I found earlier (gold, health and max health).
I feel like I have tried everything on my own and I am really out of ideas. I don't know what I do wrong and why I keep failing.
Could you guys help me step up a little bit, as I am kinda enjoying this, but I am really, really, really stuck at this point.
If you want to find a static pointer in Java you have to understand that all the base address for objects are dynamic. The memory management system will shift things around as it sees fit. A way to get around this is to AOBscan into a function that uses that variable and grab the address from there because the same system that moves the base address around will also update every function as it goes.
a. give you location of the code that writes to the gold? e.g. mov [ebx+C1], eax //here C1 is offset to gold variable, and ebx is pointer to player object
1. Go to Memory View -> View -> Enumerate DLLs and symbols. Look in to game exe, dlls. It'll look like this.
2. Find a method on player class which gets executed more often like 'onMove'. Do AOB scan code injection on suitable instruction in method.
5. On main screen of Cheat engine do 'Add address manually'. Check pointer box. In pointer name put myPlayerPointer. in offset put health offset.
6. Now on main window run 'Player mods' script first. Then you'll see health pointer showing health value.
There is undeniable, ever-increasing evidence that a Cabal of powerful world elites believe in and worship something they call “Lucifer.”
Is there any truth to the idea that an “opponent” exists in a Universe that is truly holographic — where we are all reflections of One Infinite Creator?
If we move fear out of the way for a moment, ask the question objectively and apply the latest scientific knowledge we now have, we may find a solution to the mess we are in.
Lucifer may well be a holographic projection of the part of ourselves that is an angry, rebellious child, defiantly throwing a temper tantrum and screaming “F- You Mommy and Daddy!”
By healing this wounded child within ourselves, we may actually be influencing the collective — and quickening the defeat of the Cabal on a planetary scale.
On September 17, 2013, a physics breakthrough emerged that is so significant, so all-encompassing, it renders our existing worldview as irrelevant as the flat earth.
This discovery is so new and fresh that the final paper itself wasn’t published until December 6, 2013 — just two months ago at the time of this writing.
Two physicists, Nima Arkani-Hamed and Jaroslav Trnka, essentially proved that space and time do not exist — at least not in the way we now think.
What appears to be a visible universe, with a clearly defined past, present and future, is not real.
The Universe is actually a holographic projection of a single geometric form — which these two physicists call “The Amplituhedron.”
The proof for this is quite elaborate — and was recently covered in seven different episodes of my half-hour-a-week TV show, Wisdom Teachings.
You can catch every episode of this show — now numbering over 50 in total — for free, during a 10-day trial membership.
Here we will review some of the highlights — and provide links where you can do your own research on this stunning new discovery.
This breakthrough appeared only one month after my new book, The Synchronicity Key, debuted at #8 on the New York Times best-seller list — thanks to your support.
Last year was pretty rough, given how hard I worked on this book, monthly conferences and Wisdom Teachings. I’m finally feeling relaxed enough to write long articles again.
The timing and nature of this announcement seemed like quite a synchronicity in its own right — and was a compelling reflection of the title and subject of the book.
I was thrilled to find this new discovery, because it was the final, crowning piece of the puzzle I’ve been putting together in my books, television show, film, lectures, videos, et cetera for all these years.
This research can be traced all the way back to the first ESP book I read when I was seven years old — some 34 years ago now.
Even after all the work I’ve done, I never expected that a single scientific discovery would so precisely define the Law of One as a universal truth.
The Synchronicity Key compellingly argues that time is cyclical, not linear. We also make the case that these cycles are powered by vast, unseen geometric patterns in space.
The full proof of the geometry, and how it functions, will be laid out in my next book, The Hidden Architecture of Time — and this new discovery will now form a key part of the argument.
The Amplituhedron discovery proves that all of space, all of time, all of matter, all of energy and all of consciousness is emanating from a single geometric form.
Like the “recursive” patterns within a fractal, there are many sub-geometries of this central pattern that we will find in space — and in time.
Each of these geometric patterns act as holographic reflections of this one, singular element — which is forming the entire Cosmos.
The astonishing, provable cycles of historical events that I revealed in Synchronicity are ultimately caused by fractals of a single, universal geometry.

This post at cosmicvariance refers to a question at the Edge world question center: "what have you changed your mind about?" It's interesting reading, and I recommend it.
Although I'm not quite a luminary up there with those quoted in Sean's post, I'm going to give two answers.
The first answer, of course, is very personal, and was represented by the huge life change I went through in 2007. Specifically, I decided that a career in the research and teaching of physics and astronomy wasn't worth it. I was at the wrong place (a research University) at the wrong time (when it was getting more difficult to get NSF funding) which made it really the wrong place (the research University was inflexible enough that funding was a tenure veto criterion), and I failed to move to the right place (I interviewed at a few liberal arts colleges I would have loved to go to, but either didn't get offers, or in one case got an offer that was not feasable for me). I loved the teaching of physics and astronomy, and loved the science, but finally was able to admit to myself that it had been a few years since that love justified putting up with the crap. The main reason I hadn't admitted that to myself was that to leave was to be a failure. (Indeed, today, I still feel a bit like a failure because I couldn't make it in academia.) However, I've moved on to something else which I'm finding stimulating and rewarding. I'd thought about letting go a few times before; this was the time when I was able to bring my mind around enough to actually letting go. I'm glad I did it before my hand was forced by being fired. (Many not in academia don't realize that being denied tenure means that you must leave the institution where you are, but that is the case.)
The second answer I have is more longwinded, and is a change of mind that happened over the last six or seven years. Specifically: some form of socialized medicine is necessary for the good of the United States. If you had asked me six years ago my opinions about socialized medicine, I would have repeated a lot of the arguments you hear from others who are opposed to it: freedom to choose your doctor and other health care providers, long wait time for non-immediate-emergency procedures in some countries that currently have socialized medicine, the typical inefficency of anything that is government controlled, the quashing of innovation that comes whenever anything is moved out of the free market and into a centrally controlled bureaucracy.
And, the truth is, I still believe a lot (if not all) of those things. However, until eight or nine years ago, I was in the situation that a lot of Americans are in. I was young and healthy (or healthy enough). I had no major illnesses. I had health insurance through (first) my graduate school or (later) my job, and as such was able to get what care I needed. I didn't worry too much, because if I got a contracting job, or something else that didn't pay health insurance, it was possible to get personal health insurance. (I know a few people who do that.)
I married somebody with a chronic illness. Somebody who will not be able to get health insurance-- because it makes no business sense whatsoever to give it to her-- unless she's in a large group plan, where the power of group bargaining is able to bring her into that plan. She also isn't able to work a full time job; the fatigue and restrictions that comes with her illness make it very challenging for her to even work a quarter time. What this means is that I, as her husband, must remain in a job that's got a group health insurance plan, or we're screwed.
For most middle-class Americans without children, I suspect that housing (i.e. mortgage or rent) is the dominant single expense they have. In our house, even after health insurance, medical needs is our dominant single expense. This is part of why I wasn't able to take the job offer I had at a small liberal arts college a couple of years ago; I couldn't afford the 30% pay cut that taking that job would have represented. It is also part of why I'm very anxious and afraid about making any kind of job change. Everybody is anxious and afraid about losing their job, because of the uncertainty and fear of insecurity that comes with it. People like me-- people with uninsurable family members-- have the additional anxiety that we must be able to find a job that includes a group health insurance plan. I worry about getting fired from my current job-- not just for the reasons that everybody worries, but also because I would absolutely need to find a new job as fast as possible that my wife and I wouldn't find ourselves in the financially untenable position of having a gap in insurance that would cause "pre-existing condition" clauses to kick in on whatever policy we had with the new job. This isn't just me; many, many people are in the same situation as my family.
The current situation hurts small businesses too-- the sort of thing that free markets are supposed to be the biggest supporter of. My aunt runs an ice cream store, and has for many years. She often find it exhausting, unsurprisingly. She would love to find somebody she could hire on and keep as a long-term manager, but she's had a lot of trouble doing this. Several years ago, when talking to her about this, and feeling (as I always did) stressed and unhappy with academia, I briefly fantasized about moving to Charleston, WV, working as a manager at an ice cream shop, and having a much lower stress life. The problem is, my aunt can't hire on somebody that is really good enough to be a manager who will stay for long, because she would need to offer them health insurance... and at a store with a handful of employees, that's simply not possible. So, the best people she hires tend to be short-term... students and others who have plans to move on to bigger and better things. Right now, security in health insurance is coupled to having somebody in the family working at a large enough employer to have a group health insurance plan. This means that somebody who might (for other reasons) decide to take a job with a very small business may not practically speaking have the freedom of choice to do so.
The free market is a great solution to many things. It's far more flexible than a centrally managed solution. In many cases, if you try to dictate the solution ahead of time, you ossify your society, writing in strictures for how things work that may not be the best, and may not keep up with the change of society and technology. If you have a free market, the market can adapt to new solutions naturally, without having to convince people wedded to the old ways of doing things to change the laws and government procedures. For a lot of things, this is great. But, to many libertarians, the free market is the hammer that makes everything in the world look like a nail. While the free market may do the greatest good to the greatest number of people in many cases, when it comes to health insurance, working out a good solution for the majority of people mean that those not in the majority suffer and die. It's not a matter of providing the best entertainment options, of providing the kinds of cars people want, of providing the food choices that people are willing to pay for; it's a matter of sickness and health, and of life and death.
And, we don't even really have a free market solution right now. The system we have in this country right now mixes all of the worst aspects of free-market health care and socialized medicine. One of the biggest worries with socialized medicine is that we'd be turning over our health care to the same people who run the IRS, to the same people who run the DMV, to the same legions of politicians and faceless bureaucrats that haven't been able to balance the budget for years. People would end up cogs in the system, without the freedom to make intelligent choices about health care providers themselves. But think about it: how different is that, really, from what we have right now? If you're in a group health insurance plan, you are at the mercy of the "preferred provider" list and the formulary of that plan. If you're like me, and only occasionally have to go to the doctor, you don't notice that the system of insurance we have is saddled with soulless bureaucracies as much as any government agency... but it is. My wife, exhausted already, spends far too much time talking to health care providers trying to figure out how to get this or that thing approved, trying to figure out what changes were made to the drug formulary this year. And, all of the expected symptoms of bureaucratic bloat are there. Byzantine and complicated rules. Different answers every time you get somebody different on the phone. Uncertainty as to whether or not something you need will really be covered. Backtracking as the insurance company screws something up and tries to tell you that what you didn't isn't allowed. And, finally, for some things, paying a full out-of-pocket price because (for example) psychological health care is never covered at the level of physical health care.
In many ways, we've already saddled ourselves with a lot of the bogey men that those against socialized medicine scare us with. At the same time, we have the fundamental problem of a free market health care solution : people falling between the cracks. Those who aren't basically healthy being left behind by a system that recognizes that it is simply not economically sensible to keep them alive.
Now, mind you, we could very easily -- and, I fear, probably will -- do socialized medicine dreadfully wrong. If and when we implement some form of universal health care in this country, I think we should look to how the framers of the Constitution implemented government. We would need some form of separation of powers (with checks and balances), and we would need some explicit declarations of individuals rights. In particular, the organization or agency that pays for health insurance must be explicitly separated from the organization or agency that dictates what is covered. Without that, budget constraints will inevitably lead to the same nightmare of capricious and mercurial lists of what and who is covered that we have in our current system.
If I were president, the very first thing I'd do is outlaw pharmaceutical patents, coupled with a raise in the budget for pharmaceutical research. This would very likely spin the country into a huge recession, because so many of our mutual funds are heavily invested in profitable drug companies right now... but we'd come out a stronger and more moral place on the other side. Pharmaceutical companies argue that drug patents, and the exclusive rights that those companies receive allowing them to sell drugs for the mint they are sold for, are necessary to fund research. Of course, it turns out that those patents are funding advertising more than research. We don't need pharmaceutical companies to develop drugs; what we need are the drug researchers and those who directly support them. If the chemists and biologists who develop new drugs can make a reasonable living doing that with publicly funded research, we will still get the new drugs that we get right now... without having to sign over control over the pricing of these new drugs to a soulless entity (a large corporation) that's only interested in leveraging its assets for maximum profit. As a side benefit, we'd no longer be in the position our country has been in in recent years, having to argue that people in Africa need to die in order to "protect the intellectual property" of the USA. (AIDS drugs can be very expensive, and many impoverished nations in Africa can't afford them. The USA has in the past argued explicitly against ways to provide affordable drugs to these populations, because to do so would have been to allow production of those drugs in violation of the patents granted to the US companies that developed them. This is not the behavior of a moral nation.)
So, yes, many years ago I was opposed to socialized medicine because of (a) fear of ever growing government control, (b) the inefficiency and threat to innovation represented by large bureaucracies, and (c) freedom of choice. It took being married to somebody who really has to interact with our current health care system all the time to recognize that for many in this country, we don't entirely have any of (a), (b), or (c) with our current system... and we do have people left behind by that system.
Strangely enough, I've changed my mind on those same two issues. On the academic career one, though I'm still be in grad school (in physics) -- I've decided to try for industry jobs first. Because yours isn't the only story of tenure denied that I've heard, and I know a couple of perpetual post-docs, and because I've seen what my advisor has to do to get and keep funding, and don't want any part of it. I do feel a little guilty because I'm female and now going to be part of the "leaky pipeline" though...
On the health care -- it's my husband's mother who's sick and unable to work, and I hate that we're grad-student poor and unable to help. She lives with her own mother who recently broke her knee, and with neither one able to really walk right now, they're having to call 9-1-1 when she tries to walk on the broken knee to go to the bathroom because she has no other choice besides soiling her sheets -- and neither would be able to clean that up.
In high school, I read Ayn Rand and bought into the fantasy of a world where everyone was self-supporting, dignified, independent. But now I wonder, if Ayn Rand had ever got the kind of disease where you can't control your own bowels, had been bedridden, would she still have been a such a committed individualist? In the real world, where sickness and age exist, we can't all be self supporting. Even after getting over my fling with libertarianism, though, I was uncertain if health care was one of the things the government should be doing, worried that public health care would weaken innovation, a lot which comes from American companies.
I agree with you that there are many wrong ways to do public health care, but after seeing what my husband's family is going through and feeling powerless to help, I think it couldn't be much worse than the current system. Most sick people need basic nursing care more than they need new drugs anyway. I've put it in the category of things like "the highway system" and "printing currency" in my mind now -- things that have to exist for society to work, and which the free market won't do right because the profit incentives point in the wrong directions.
Re: going into industry, don't feel guilty. It's not your responsibility to fix the problem with an uneven playing field for women in physics! It's your responsibility to choose the life path for yourself that makes the most sense.
Re: flings with libertarianism, I still sort of consider myself a libertarian. I described myself to a co-worker as a "Howard Dean Republican." He said that made no sense... but I said I was a libertarian in favor of socialized medicine. He started to think, yeah, OK, perhaps "Howard Dean Republican" is about right.
My politics is all over the map. People who learn my opinion on one thing are often surprised to find my opinion on another.
I used to work for an auto glass manufacturer, which sounds irrelevant until you realize it's another heavily insurance-driven industry. There are a whole lot of freaky things that result from that... moral hazards become deeply entrenched parts of the industry. And then there's the whole pharmaceuticals influence (there's probably parallels with the auto industry somehow, but I won't stretch the analogy that far). If it weren't for health insurance, and HMOs, and other "unnatural" influences on the market, I think the medical industry would be entirely different. (Perhaps not better. But wrong in different ways, if not.)
So yeah, I'm kind of with you: I don't like the idea of socialized medicine at all, but at this point I don't see an alternative given what the medical industry has grown into.
FWIW, I don't think socialised medicine is *inherently* more incompatible with freedom of choice than non-scoialised systems are -- I think it rather depends on how the systems are set up. For example, in the UK's National Health System, I can chose my GP. That is, I can walk into a GP practice and be regsitered with that GP. If I then decide don't like that GP, I can walk into a different GP's office the next day and request to be registered with the new GP, without having to give any reason, and my notes will be transfered accordingly. That's freedom of choice, isn't it? Equally, if I need to be referred to a specialist, I can ask my GP to refer me to Dr Jo Bloggs if I happen to know of a Dr Jo Bloggs whom I would like to be seen by (assuming s/he is appropriately qualified to treat me).
By the same token, I know lots of people in the US who have insurance who have limited choice in who they can see -- for example, there might be a very limited list of a certain type of specialist there insurer will cover them for. In those cases, when comparing "like for like" it seems that the NHS system has at least as much freedom of choice as the US system.
The NHS does have a seriously "postcode lottery" problem, but I don't think that's really inherent in socialised systems -- one could sort that problem (if the powers that be were so inclined) by redistributing funds appropriately.
As for inefficiency...comparing "like for like" (ie, uninsured people in the NHS with uninsured people in the US system), at least people in the NHS get treated eventually, whereas in the US many people just don't get treated. And again, I think this is a function of the amount of money put into the system, and the contracts etc that are being used. The NHS doesn't have to be as inefficient as it is -- pay rises and decent working conditions for nursing staff etc, would go a long way to helping with the understaffing issue. But that requires better/greater progressive taxation.
I also have chronic health problems, BTW. I'm not sure that living in the US is a viable option for me, although I am a US citizen. I live in the UK, and I'm very glad that I have access to the NHS, even with all its faults.
Inefficiency in 'socialized medicine'.... Dunno, I'd perhaps find that argument more convincing, if the US didn't spend roughly twice as large a part of their GDP on health care as most European countries. So, basically, my most important argument against privatized health care is that it's too expensive. Yeah, I know, the market is supposed to 'always be more efficient', but
1) If a theory doesn't agree with the data, it's the theorist's job to explain that, not just deny the data.
2) The axioms of the usual market theories may not be fulfilled in health care: Some participants in the relevant market may not be very well able to choose rationally and all that. Because of being ill and frightened.
It does sadden me, though, that many whom I've met with views supporting universal single payer healthcare do so only after relatively personal experiences (e.g. your wife's situation).
(Note: Wish you had a plugin that allowed commenters to be notified when someone responds to a post that the person commented in - I'll likely never read your response without it).
First, I have to agree entirely with Schlupp: data shows that 'socialized medicine' is vastly more efficient than the current US system. And I have to agree with IrrationalPoint: as a Canadian, I can call any GP or walk into any clinic with no problems. If I don't like a specialist a GP refers me to, I can ask her to refer me to another. My experience working in the US has not been so positive.
But my question follows up on Someone's comment: why did it take your wife's chronic illness to change your mind? Why were you unable to imagine a situation like yours and your wife's, until you found yourself in it?
Please don't read that as an attack. Every person I've met who is opposed to socialized health care seems to suffer this same inability to imagine themselves in a situation like yours, and I am honestly struggling to understand why.
Cos, to paraphrase the parable (or whatever), you never really know someone's situation till you've walked a mile in their shoes.
I looked down on the working poor till I took a vocational class and had a chance to converse with them. Now I know that most of them *want* to improve the situation of themselves and their families, they just need some help.
I never realized the limitations of our local public transit service till I spent 8 years riding the busses. Thank God I have a car now, but I will never again take mobility for granted.
And, although MediCal is perhaps not all it could be, it is infinitely better than our county MIA (Medically Indigent Adult) program. For one thing, my primary care doctor actually knows what the heck he's doing. My kidney stone was finally diagnosed after years of wannabe doctors (the county hospital is also a teaching hospital) telling me my back pain was due to my weight and there was no point in doing anything about it.

I am happy to see that you have joined this website. We offer you a safe and clean website with normal, decent people, whom we all know a little bit. There is no need to worry about the person you chat or pm with, because everyone has to identify himself to the Site Owner or Forum Master (see further).
For now: Have fun and read a lot to begin with and observe it all. You do not have to post (a lot) immediately, let alone post something every day and read everything; even only once a week and trying to read bits and pieces, that is fine too. Below you will find the description of a number of items that you should know about this website and how the forum works.
For people who are not very strong in English: if you scroll to the lowest grey task bar , you will find a cell at the left where it says: English. Click the triangle next to it and many more options will appear. Each European can thus choose in which language he wants the menu of this site, to make sure that you maybe understand all options better. You can switch as often as you want to. Furthermore, in the country sections of every one’s country, their own language is spoken.
As mentioned already, we want a safe site with normal, decent people. We do not appreciate people who try to make money in dubious ways and/or are working in the hp-business. Therefore it is obligatory to fill in the five most important fields of your profile and answer 3 questions that the administrator or moderator asks you. After that you will be allowed to participate completely. This procedure is to ensure everyone’s security. Also during meetings.
Therefore fill in your profile first. We would like to know more or less who you are and what you do. You do not have to enter details that you not want everybody to know, such as your full name. But put your first name in at least. On the other hand, the more complete you fill in your profile, the more serious you are considered and more trustworthy and the sooner you will make friends. If you have a nice picture, upload the picture of your beauty. Especially if you are a Ferrari owner. If you do not own a Ferrari (yet), it may also be your current car of course. Or place a picture of your dream Ferrari.
With us you can try things and see if you like it during max. 6 months. If you are new, identify yourself on the main thread of F-specific and tell something about yourself. The moderator or one of the other 2 platinum subscribed members will then contact you and ask you a few more general questions. After that you can start for trial period. 30 days before the end of this period, you will receive an e-mail and pm that this period will end. That means that you will still have one month to subscribe officially. If you do not do so, your user name, pm-box and all your posts will automatically expire.
If you think that you will stay and post or read regularly, then subscribe as a member. It has many advantages. First of all you can upload an avatar. This is the little picture next to everyone’s name, once you have posted. That looks nice and friendly. Apart from that is also nice for yourself to see your favourite picture and it makes your posts a bit more personal. It also makes the entire page livelier. Next to that your user name will also be in bold. Apart from this you are allowed to upload many more pictures and scans and you will have a larger pm-box. To do this, you first have to subscribe as bronze (1 year) or silver (3 years).
This costs only Euro 10,- per year or Euro 25,- for 3 years. To be paid by bank transfer or Paypal. Below you will find the description on how to subscribe: in the blue-grey bar on the top right, it says: ‘subscription info’, click on that. Two options will appear: bronze and silver. You have to make a choice there and click further. On the next page you will see our bank account number or the option to pay via Paypal. Usually within 48 hours we will receive your payment and your subscription will be activated.
If you wish to send a reaction to someone, first look at that person’s ‘status’. In principle we are obviously all equal as human being but in practice in this chat we have not invented for nothing a system of indications to mark someone based on the number of posts that he has placed. You can see that underneath the user name: 0-50 = rookie, 51-250 = carting, 251-1000 = formula junior, etc. up to F1 world champion (after 10.000 posts!).
On the top right you can see when someone has subscribed, so how long that person is already on this site. And you can also see how many posts he has already done. Of course you treat all your co-members with respect but an F1-Veteran, registered in 2003 with even more respect than for example a rookie.
The first one has posted much more, most likely knows a lot more about different things, has seen different subjects pass by more than 10 times, etc. This is the same for the F-owner! And without owners, the fun of our hobby would soon be over. Therefore an F-owner is a little bit different than an F-admirer, let alone a young F-fan such as students. A bit strange maybe, internet belongs to all of us, this site is from everybody and for everybody, but I believe it is better to maintain a little bit of ‘perspective” on this website. In that way things will go smoother.
Then there is something else: each country has its own ‘moderator’. They have certain competences while treating members and guarding the threads; technically, because they can change posts or remove them for example for inappropriate language, suspected criminal activities, indecent things. Information: our moderator is NoFear02. He has been a Formula3-member for 1 year already. He has therefore seen a lot already. Then there are approximately 10 gold subscribed members for special contributions. Two other people are platinum subscribed and they form the Board of this site.
You can have a look at the subjects in the sub-forums and threads in your own country section, to find out what is being discussed there. Some sections have sub-sections. Just click and try it out.
In the column on the right you can see who sent the last reaction. Underneath Ferrari-specific is a main thread: this is an ongoing story. There is another one in the chitchat (not f-related). You can also have a look in the general forum. If one of us has posted somewhere, it might be worthwhile to read the English threads for example. These are often serious, about real F-info etcetera. For technical questions and answers you can chat with owners of certain types of cars: per model. And you can ask thing, exchange experiences, etcetera. Especially technical information for repairs can be very important.
Since the structure of all sections for all European countries is the same, it is also nice to have a look in another country, to see what is going on there. For example, looking at pictures from another country is always fun.
So you have the common forums all the way at the top, then the country sections from Europe, than the global continents and then some other topics. Later a section will be added where you can buy F-chat.eu merchandise and read the newsletter from the owner Rob van Gemeren. Each European country has several forum sections in their own language. The common sections are in English.
Threads where you have already been before and where new posts have been added, are in bold. Click on the blue arrow pointing down and go to the first new post that you have not read yet. Convenient!
You can also click on ‘last page’ further to the right and leave a post there. You can also go to the last placed post immediately: go to the dark grey part on the right, the blue arrow pointing to the side.
If you decide to post something (just click on the ‘post reply’ button all the way at the end of the page) and you have typed something, do a preview first to see if it looks good. Is a quote looking well, for example? Only after doing that, place the post. You can still change your post until 60 minutes after placing it (via edit) or even remove it (after edit; delete).
Do not just suggest some kind of wild idea, check first if there are no other people already busy with that subject or have been in the past. And never take over a thread by placing too many posts. I find 6 to 8 per day in one thread is actually already a lot. Further: do not offend anyone; see the rules. You are allowed to tease, obviously, therefore you can use the smilies, see there. Please pay attention to your language, no swearing or sexual remarks. Gross language such as the word f*ck will already be depicted automatically as 4 little stars. But that also does not look very nice.
Also pay close attention to the distinction between F-chat and chitchat. Use the chitchat to fool around and to talk about this and that.
If you wish to indicate in what sort of emotion your text is meant to be read, such as smiling, confused or angry, you can use a so called smiley. This is a little face that conveys a certain facial expression. Take a look in: Search, 3rd option: FAQ, enter, v Bulletin FAQ, 1st option: user maintenance, enter and then to the third square, 3rd option, what are smilies. You are then here:
If you want to be funny, at least learn the most important ones and how to type them: the wink, smile, big smile and sticking out your tongue, looking serious (knit your eyebrows). This way the chance is bigger that some one does not misunderstand you.
About quoting: do not type entire parts of a text, that looks strange and you have to scroll endlessly; take out the middle part and connect the first part with dots to the last part (like this: “….”). So you leave 3 to 5 words, then dots and then the last 3 to 5 words. Please pay attention that you leave the quotation marks and do not delete them, because like that you will not get such a blue piece. A quote always starts with […] and ends with [/…].
If you want to quote several parts from several people in one new message, just click on the little sign all the way at the end on the right: the letter with the quotation marks and the plus sign. If you click on that it becomes orange and once you have selected the messages where you want to post on, click on Quote or Post reply and a window will appear with all these quotes. Pay attention to where you start typing.
In a new post you press post reply. You then see a white window with “message”. Underneath this you see a light blue option which says: ''additional options". There, in the middle you see a grey option, which says: manage attachments. Click on it. After that, you’ll see a pop up screen with 4 white squares; in these squares you can upload your pictures to the thread. I suppose you where you save your images on your computer. Then you press the option behind it: browse. Then you go to the file on your computer you want to upload. Once you have selected 1,2,3, or 4 pictures, you select “upload”. You’ll see then “uploading files- please wait” and a little blue bar that grows until it is full. Sometimes, this takes a little while. When you’re finished you’ll see your uploaded files as 'current attachments'. Here you have the possibility to remove files. After that you select “close this window”. Do not select escape or close the window, because that would mean you would have to start all over again. When you think you’re finished, you can select “preview message” in case you still want to change something in your message or, perhaps add punctuations. You can also do a final check to see if you selected the right pictures.
Then you select submit. If you punt all arrows down in the grey “attachment key”, the window is a lot shorter. If you open all the arrows you can find all kinds of files you can upload and their maximum size. If you are really into these things, you might want to take a look, otherwise, just leave it. The only thing you do need to know is the maximum size of the pictures and images you want to upload: 1280x1024 pixels. If you upload something, though, and it is too big, the programme will automatically reduce it.
If you like someone or if you think somebody is posting interesting things, if you’ve met someone or if someone lives close by, make him your buddy. Every member can create a buddy list, with all of your buddies together. This might come in handy, if you want to see who of your friends is on-line. Otherwise you have to go to your post box every time, check the colour of the little square (the one with the funny “V”) behind his nickname. White means your buddy is on-line, blue means off-line. You can open the buddy list by selecting “user controls” in the grey blue bar on top.
You can then type the first 3 or 4 letters of a nickname, wait a few seconds, after which you’ll see a list with options of everyone who has a nickname that starts with the same letter. Select the name of the person you want to add to your buddy list, and ready!
There is another way of doing this; just browse through a part of a thread and every time you see the nickname of someone you want to add to your buddy list, simply click on his name (not on his avatar) and wait for a blue menu to appear. Select the final option: 'add to your buddy list'. And ready.
Once you have created a buddy list, you’ll probably select “user controls” every now and then to open it and see who of your buddies is on-line. This is also an easy way to send someone a PM, because if you select the blue square left of his name, you get to his profile right away. There you select “contact information” and “send a private message”.
You should use this list only in special cases, otherwise it will undermine the fun of the thread, but if someone annoys you big time, of if you have had an irreparable argument with someone, you can put this person on your ignore list.
By doing this, you won’t see his posts any more. The system works the same as with the buddy list, check under buddy list end there all the way at the bottom, you will see the ignore menu. You can always remover someone from the list, just as with the buddy list. On both you can add or remove people.
This means sending someone a Private Message, personally, from one to the other, outside the thread. Not everything you communicate on the website is meant for everyone. It might be of no interest whatsoever to the other, or it might be confidential. Perhaps you want to ask someone a personal question, about his car or perhaps you want to invite someone to go for a drive.
You can also select a name in your buddy list, select the square and arrive on his profile. On the right you’ll see the option:”send Private Message”. Unfortunately it is not possible to send an attachment with your PM. Above on the right on the general site, in the dark grey square above the blue grey bar, the welcome, you’ll see “private message” underlined and “unread” and the total of messages in your mailbox. Select the underlined and you will go to your PM-box. If there are new messages, you’ll see the 2 words “private message” in bold/black. Click on the new message to read it. Below, you’ll see “reply” to send an answer. (you cannot use more than 5000 characters in your text). Press forward if you want to also forward the message to someone else (be sure it is not a very private message…!)
They will automatically be kept in the sent or inbox. By clicking the little squares behind the message you can delete them. Be sure to keep the important ones of course! You can also select and copy messages or parts of them to your own Word documents or copy an email to your normal mailbox. This can come handy when saving interesting information or telephone numbers etc.
If you are a silver member you can save up to 200 messages in your PM-box. If it is full for 90% you will get a message telling you it is almost full. You’ll then have to delete some items.
Sending Private Message is a lot of fun and very important item in a forum like this. If you think someone writes interesting or funny things, if someone lives in your neighbourhood or if you see someone has the same car as you or a car you really like, don’t hesitate to send him a PM! If you do not get a message back, then obviously the other one is not interested. This can happen of course, there are no obligations whatsoever.
Of course there are rules at this forum to make sure everyone knows what to expect. You can read the rules under “search” (second word on the left in the blue grey bar) then: “rules”. In short: you are not allowed to endanger the community, you do not quarrel with other members, you respect other members, you do not offend them in any way, you are not allowed to use rude or abusive language, nor do you place sexually-orientated remarks on the forum. Photos of scarcely dressed women (minimum dressed in bikini) are to be put only in the special bikini section, only accompanied by a Ferrari.
Of course F-chat is not a real club or association, so there are no regular compulsory gatherings or anything, but since 2006 we have had quite a few meetings in the Netherlands. On these occasions, we park our cars somewhere, have a drink, after which we go for a drive twice. In the evening we have a barbecue or a dinner. Besides these events we try organise something each month, every time on a different location. We have created a special calendar for these events.
We also meet on a regular basis in smaller groups (e.g. people who live close to each other) and go for a little drive or have small gatherings. Everything can be arranged by PM or just on the thread.
If you want to have an impression of one of those meetings, open your F-chat, go to the European section, Netherlands/Belgium and then to “nwe waterweg”.
If you want to know what someone is doing on this site, go to his profile, click on “find all posts by xxx” and you can read everything this person has written and where. (on which threads). This gives you the opportunity to learn more about a person, apart from what he has written on his profile.
Carelessly filling out your profile makes you seem non-serious, suspicious and unpleasant. So please fill out your profile with care. We would like to know in which city you live, your age (approximately), your profession. All of this information only enhances the contact and the bond we try to establish with each other. As you can understand it can make a big difference whether you are chatting with someone who is 18 years old or 45 years old.
I believe I have informed you sufficiently about this website and hopefully this information will make your stay on the website more pleasant. At first, take it easy do not go posting like a madman. Just read a bit. In time you can enter the main thread. Save handy Private Messages you receive. If all the information on the website gets overwhelming, you can also copy parts of the text to your own email or to your personal files. You might consider printing the information and keep it next to your keyboard and then try to find out how everything works.
Just give it a try! If you want to, I can always give more tips on tricks hidden on this website, like more search possibilities and the possibility of seeing the statistics.

Mustard gas blisters and a daily risk of death: Bravery of soldiers still clearing the 'iron harvest' of World War I shells from beneath Flanders' fields
Fields littered with tens of thousands of unexploded shells, some with deadly chemical weapons like mustard gas
Work to clear as many mines as possible for events marking 100th anniversary of World War I next year
In 2012 160 tonnes of munitions unearthed from under Ypres, including bullets, stick grenades, naval gun shells
The Duke of Edinburgh will represent the Queen and his country on Armistice Day tomorrow at what will signal the beginning of a year of extraordinary remembrance and commemoration ahead of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of World War One.
He will be in Ypres in Belgium - 'Wipers' to the legions of men who suffered and died in the cauldron of the infamous salient - as thousands of families across Britain prepare for pilgrimages next year to the battlefields where their ancestors held the line against the Germans determined to expel them.
The guns fell silent long ago. But the tranquil beet, wheat and potato fields of Flanders still harbour the whizz-bangs, toffee apples, moaning minnies, Jack Joneses and a terrible plethora of other devices given jocular names by the troops who suffered grievously under their downfall.
An estimated 300million of the billion projectiles the British and the Germans hurled at each other in the immortal salient - still the biggest graveyard of the British Army - were duds, and most of them have not been recovered.
Last year close to 160 tonnes of them were unearthed from the below-sea-level soil around Ypres - from bullets to stick grenades to colossal 15 inch naval gun shells capable of tearing down an entire city block. This is the equivalent of five fully-loaded articulated lorries.
The Daily Mail was granted the privilege of being the last newspaper to be allowed to accompany the brave men of the Belgium army whose job it is to harvest this ferrous crop of death. As their work tempo increases ahead of the influx of tourists expected next year, the unit whose motto is 'I Do Not Fear Dangers', cannot spare any more time to publicise its unique trade.
'You're the last,' said Dirk Gunst, a 2nd Lieutenant with the DOVO squad charged with collecting and destroying these lethal relics from a war which felled nine million men along with three empires and the sureties of the Edwardian age.
'We just don't have the time. We are expecting thousands of people next year and we have to gather up as much as we can before then and request tourists to leave anything they see in the ground.'
His is not an exaggerated plea. The iron harvest continues to kill and maim. Over 20 of his comrades have died since the unit was formed in 1919, four of those in 1986 when a massive German mortar blew up after it was transported to the unit's depot in fields near the sleepy hamlet of Poelkappele.
Ten years ago, two teenagers who took a blowtorch to a British 6lb high explosive shell in a bid to tear off the brass driving band - fitted to make the projectile spin through the air and traditionally collected by locals to turn into trinkets and jewellery - were blown to smithereens.
There is at least one fatality a year, many more injuries, when shells fired nearly a century ago suddenly decide to end their long hibernation and detonate.
Even Dirk's men, who work in teams of three, have suffered burns from mustard and phosgene gas shells that were split open and leaking their caustic contents.
'We fear no danger but we don't go in for heroics,' said Dirk, whose HQ is testament to the numerous fiendish ways the warring parties of the 'Great War' developed to kill one another.
'Look at this one,' he says, holding up a shell cut away to reveal a dark green glass vessel inside the colour of an old beer bottle.
'This was a German shell, not gas, but it contains an agent that causes vomiting the instant you smell it.
'The Germans would fire these at the British front line; then men would hurriedly put their gas masks on. But many would have to remove them as they began to vomit - and then the Germans would lob over the real gas shells to catch the troops without their respirators.'
The shells, fuses, grenades, mines, mortars, bullets and blocks of ammonal explosive and TNT left behind by the titanic armies which fought around Ypres become more unstable with each passing day.
Some 70 men of the DOVO unit hold the line against these rotting weapons of total war as firmly as the men who fired them held their own ground at places whose names made the world hold its breath.
'We have a system in place with the police and the fire brigade,' said Dirk, 40, who has served with the Belgian army in Laos dismantling the ordnance left behind by the Americans in their lost war against Vietnam.
'Outcalls are prioritised as urgent - say shells found near a school or a busy crossroads - or those churned out by a farmer and left lying at the edge of a lonely field which don't require such immediate attention.
'All these,' he said, waving his arm at the serried ranks of defused devices large and small which stand like iron sentinels in the unit's lecture room, 'are our learning tools. We can tell a high explosive from a white phosphorous shell - usually. But even we get caught out.'
Suddenly his lecture is interrupted by a phone call. Thirty minutes down the road - a distance which the combined forces of the British empire took four years to traverse - a potato processing plant has turned up a 'large' projectile. Men are working there, the call is treated as urgent and Dirk is soon on the scene.
'French 105mm,' he proclaims. The shell stands upright on a forklift pallet, caked in the kind of 'rusticles' that adorn sunken ships, but definitely identifiable as a shell.
Dirk is angry. 'People get blase about these things,' said the father-of-three. 'They have stood it upright, which was not how it was found. No shell should be touched unless it is by us. Not only could the fuse suddenly decide to do its work, the shell might be toxic, or even the outside may be contamined by chemical weapons that have lain in the soil next to it.
The French 105 was left to teeter on its precarious plinth as the unit moved on to another grave of ammunition - a bed of British six pound high explosive shells unearthed by a backhoe during farmyard building work near Zonnebeke.
The shells were in rows, meaning they were probably arranged for firing when the gun crew that planned to shoot them off had to retire or advance before they could be loaded and sent on their way.
Another call sends the unit to the old German front line at Langenmarck where German hand grenades - 'Fritz sticks' - have been found along with a batch of deadly white phosphourous shells. Phosphorous burns in air so the shells are placed in vats of water; they, like all the chemical weapons discovered across the salient, require special handling to be destroyed.
All munitions handled by the unit are placed in small lorries carrying sand to reduce vibration en route back to HQ. Once there, the shells which are suspected to contain chemicals are subjected to X-Ray in a giant machine and, if found to be toxic, are then scrutinised by a neutron-induced gamma spectroscope which can identify which kind of poison lies within the corroded casings.
In vast sheds the detritus of this war which is burned into the psyche of every Briton awaits its final end. Some of it will be defused, the explosives steamed out and the fuses made safe. These projectiles will join the other 'teaching aids' for the UXB men.
The rest of the conventional shells are taken out to a lonely field bordered by earthen banks to be detonated in controlled explosions.
But the chemical weapons are handed over to a civilian contractor for destruction after they have been rendered into fluid by a freezing process. This either involves the residue being detonated in a huge vacuum chamber or being burned in furnaces equipped with numerous filters that traps and neutralises all toxins.
Close to five per cent of the shells the armies used were gas in WW1. Consequently Dirk and his men find themselves 'suiting up' in anti-chemical coveralls and helmets at least once a week.
'The toxic ones are the worst,' said Cpl. Nico Sierens, assigned to sorting through the rusting metal dump, separating the merely lethal from the lethal and sinister. 'Gas shells are not filled with gas but a liquid that burns on contact. One of the guys here suffered horrible phosgene gas burns a while back.
'You may think you know what every shell contains but you never do - that's why we need the X-Rays. No-one would thank us if we sent up a huge cloud of mustard gas in a controlled explosion.
'It takes steady nerves to work all day with unexploded bombs but we are all used to it. Its our job. We don't tend to dwell on it too much. I say we are handling history here every day.'
And they are. Lying among the shells and grenades, the mortars and the TNT blocks, are fragments of German and British kit, buttons, water bottles, ammo cases from the Ruhr with the name of the company which made the contents stamped on the side - the human element to a war devoid, for the most part, of all humanity.
'The war here was unique in many ways and that is why there is still so much stuff in the ground,' added Cpl. Sierens. 'It was virtually static for four years so the shells fell in a confined area. The ground was marshy and boggy, meaning many buried themselves after being fired or whole transports of them were lost en-route to where they were meant to be going.
'And then there was the quality of the ammunition itself. The factories of the combatants were turning out fuses and shells at a colossal rate and the quality was poor. It all added up to an enormous amount of misfires and the job that we have today.'
While much of the iron harvest comes in ones and twos, sometimes there are spectacular finds: in 2004 3,100 German artillery shells were discovered in a single place at Dadziele, east of the salient. And the ordnance men have mapped out sites for future exploration where they believe even greater quantities of unspent munitions still lie.
The shells are discovered in a myriad of ways: through farm-work, renovations of old buildings, road construction or simply the roots of trees pushing their unwanted neighbours slowly to the surface.
They were all designed to kill soldiers but they have, since 1918, claimed the lives of 360 people and injured 535 more around Ypres. In March this year seven labourers, policemen and firemen were hospitalised when a German gas shell exploded during cable-laying work in nearby Warneton.
The shells which fall into the hands of Dirk and his men are detonated daily with a chunk of TNT and an anti-tank mine on the site of their command post. A siren rings out across the flat land and then there is a tremendous roar; an echo back in time to what it was like for virtually every minute of every day of the war, only replayed on a scale thousands of times greater.
In 100 years the successors to Dirk and his men will still be doing their job of cleaning up after the men who fought and died in these corners of foreign fields.

Me: Okay when I said 5, what I meant was I suggested to them that would be a convenient time to arrive but in life it’s very difficult to control every aspect of their journey from their house to ours to ensure they arrive DOT on 5. (or something equally wise and eloquently explained)
That means I like doing things the way they are SUPPOSED to be done. And that means when I started Taekwondo training in my 40s, I naturally went along in bare feet.
In my club there’s a big mix of ages and some people wear shoes, some don’t. We train in a high school gymnasium (not a purpose facility) on wooden, often sandy, floors.
Only a few weeks in, my feet and ankles were complaining LOUDLY. And given how just about every other muscle in my entire body was responding to this entirely new form of movement I had never in my LIFE subjected them to, LOUDLY means L.O.U.D.L. EEEEEEEEEEEE.
I toyed with the idea of shoes to help. I wasn’t happy with the plan. It felt like a cop out. Like I wasn’t REALLY doing it right if I wore shoes.
Eventually though my loud feet won out and I conceded, purchasing some Adidas SM3 martial arts shoes.
I forced myself to realise that I wasn’t going to (hopefully) reach my Black Belt grading one day and have the Grand Master point at me and say:
On a more serious note though, I didn’t want to NOT get there at ALL because of pain or injury associated with barefoot training that would put me off continuing altogether.
Plus: If wearing shoes at training is good enough for my Taekwondo Master, then pretty sure it’s ok for me.
He’s a 6th Dan Black Belt, a five times Australian Open Black Belt Champion and won international gold.
“I wear shoes because of 30 years of impact on my feet. I personally have a long-term Taekwondo goal so looking after my body is my number one consideration.
“Taekwondo shoes allow me to train and protect myself so I can enjoy this fantastic art right up to my older years.”
In researching the topic online, I found a pervasive attitude towards shoes for martial arts of “just toughen up”.
Pretty sure you couldn’t apply that kind of logic with someone like Master Justin wearing shoes. He’s broken nearly every bone in both feet during his highly decorated sparring career.
In fact, I’d dare you to tell him to “toughen up”. Let me know when you do though, I’ll bring popcorn!
Other arguments talk about tradition and the custom in Asian cultures of leaving shoes at the door but the information on the specifics of that seem pretty sketchy. Though as a rule follower by nature, I can understand the thinking around traditions.
Another Master I communicated with on the topic spoke of feeling physically ill about the idea of wearing shoes for training.
Many people I came across in fact, had VERY strong opinions on the topic – some were pretty practical about it, saying the floor they trained on didn’t have mats and just wasn’t suited to bare feet – like mine!
Others talked about the definite requirement to train with bare feet because of issues around the biomechanics of the foot and leg when it came to developing balance, technique and strength.
Again, those made sense to me too – and I have to admit, as much as I LOVE my shoes now, I do take them off from time to time.
For me personally I had to ask myself, can I achieve what I want to achieve with my training if I wear shoes?
Unlike countless others who are (of course!) at a different stage in their lives and training, I’m not in competition with anyone. Only myself.
Probably not. The discomfort, pain and potential ongoing injury from barefoot training means I may have even by now, resumed my position back on the sidelines where I used to sit watching my son train and mindlessly playing with my phone.

After being introduced off the bench late in his first game, McMullin was picked to play his first full match against Hawthorn a week later. He was stationed in an unfamiliar back pocket role after playing midfield and forward in the Under 19s and Reserves, and during the match he had his jaw broken when struck by an elbow from Leigh Matthews. He returned later in the season for seven games, before retiring to concentrate on Paediatric Surgeon studies.
After his retirement McMullin played for Old Melburnians in the VAFA. In 2011 he co-founded the OMP Sports Management company and became an accredited player agent. McMullin's cousin Ian trained with the Demons in 1984 before signing with Collingwood.
Most sources show him as wearing #50 but Football Record from that year shows him as #40 after his first game.

I've been involved in fantasy baseball for a loooong time and am looking for a new league. I'm looking for what I consider to be a "standard" auction league for the upcoming season. Startup leagues ok and I'd also consider taking over an existing team.
Wish you were interested in H2H as I have an auction league with an opening. If you'd like to consider it let me know, joerosen50@gmail.com
I am the commissioner of a 12 team mixed keeper league that has been in existence for over 20 years. I am based in the New York City area, Live auction draft held in Norwalk CT. Entry fee is $165 (no fee for in-season transactions). Looking for somene to take over existing team. Our rosters include both major and minor leaguer players, we use FAAB in season and weekly transactions. Use CBS and we are 5x5 standard format ( track OB% instead of batting avg.). Let me know if you want me to send league constitution.
I am commissioner of an originally Bay Area-based baseball league that is now somewhat national with about half in the bay area.
About 5 players have been in for all 17 seasons. We added two new last year and are looking for two this year. No restrictions on trading (example, I traded $2 Trea Turner for $35-ish Madison Bumgarner in 2016 - traded a keeper for an "already stud")
DM me if you would like to consider joining, discuss, or need more info. Draft will almost certainly be second half of March. We are in a period of high turnover because we will not keep people who become very inactive, but the league is a lot of fun and mostly for bragging rights. Some owners in this league are in leagues with much higher entry fees, good quality competition overall.
We have a 5x5 roto national league only in our third year, buy in $300 and we use league safe to make payouts. Daily moves, trade all you want, $100 FAAB budget. Our draft is Friday, April 6th. Great league and commish is very experienced. If interested email haineyjkjj@comcast.net

Ask questions regarding Gentoox, Gentoo and Linux in general in these forums and we'll do our best to help you!
I was hoping to install this gentooX distro via the mechinstall hack. I got the mechinstall linux running, and I put the GentooX CD in and nothing happens.
since my usb keyboard doesn't seem to work when plugged into the console, i telnetted into the Xbox with my laptop. and i tried running the default.xbe on the CD and got some gibberish.
My question is where do I go from here? do I copy the files over to the HDD and run the install routine from there?
you need to have a modified xbox either audio/font hack modchip or tsop flash. Then you can put in the gentoox cd run it and it will install gentoox. You could run the stardust install from the mechinstaller linux but you wouldn't be able to run it afterwards.

He’s really putting on the pressure. Really gotta hope he doesn’t have an immediate answer to Birds or I could be in real trouble from a flying Midori at least until I draw Origin Story or redraw Snapback. I don’t love skipping worker but I really need to get back some cards.
Well that really slammed the brakes didn’t it? Fine by me. Some suspicious patrolling lets me get at Cal, and while I doubt the Golgort is long for the world it could come at a price. I feel like Rook should survive which is nice and will let me be pretty threatening against his now much smaller board. I’m still pretty low on cards and had to delay Rememberer since I’m pretty sure she would’ve just died here.
Does my Huntress get a shot at the birds, or would they have had to attack something beyond the patrol zone for her to shoot them with her Anti-Air?
You are correct, she only gets to fire at something going past her. Other units on the patrol zone are fair game.
Moment of Peace will get rid of the Golgort, and the Rhino might be a problem, but I’ll happily take out Midori while I build up some cards and get my Tech 3 up.
Indeed he isn’t. I’m not sure if it was or wasn’t a good play in that situation. It would have meant my Golgort died from fading but OTOH it meant you didn’t get to use the Rhino as a shield. I did have Grappling Hook that turn so I could’ve gotten around it regardless so depending on how you patrolled I could’ve gotten one or both heroes anyway.
Given the fact that you have Snapback and Origin Story at your disposal, I’m glad to get any work out of the heroes that I can. Snapback along with Grappling Hook are so strong, and Rook’s a monster. I love Strength, it’s one of my favorites.
If you mean can you use it to take a "Usable once only" Item that another player has used in a fight, no. You could use it to take an Item that the player has put on the table but not yet actually used, assuming that the card you're using allows you to steal something during combat.

This afternoon it actually happened! I walked into a restaurant, had to wait a few minutes for my table so I siddled up to a stool at the bar, the barman came and completely straight-faced asked me, in just these words, to "Name your poison". I'll admit it made me smile (even made me think for a second that I might be the reincarnation of Humphrey Bogart), and then I ordered the beverage of my choice.
Given similar circumstances before lunch or dinner, what would be your "poison" of choice? Options are open.....name your drink and the reason you would select that one specifically.
The answer really depends on a number of factors, but my choice is most likely to be whiskey of some sort, picked by scanning the shelves behind the bar and picking what interests me most without being prohibitively expensive.
https://www.bike4chai.com/SolomonRosenzweig - cycling 175 miles to raise money for summer camp for kids with cancer - doing it again for the 5th time in 2016!
Not meal-related, definately draught Guinness (when I trust the place to serve it properly and fresh). Sometimes whisky, but what I like is usually too expensive for me to drink outside so I go for something simple such as Grants Ale Cask or Ledaig.
For desert: outside - a double espresso, and at home often malt whisky, usually smokey or peaty, my current favourite selection is Talisker 18.
My two most frequent poisions are a post-lunch "mud coffee" - an Israeli/Arab (?) strong black coffee and an evening/night green tea.
In that situation I tend to like something fizzy to perk up my taste buds before the meal. If a good craft beer is available that's an excellent choice. If it's a hot day a gin and tonic does the trick. A glass of cava, prosecco, or any simple sparkler always works and always makes me happy.
In Israel, if I'm in a fine mood either a Bloody Mary or Campari-Soda. If I want to check on the bartender though, I'll order a Singapore Sling just to see if they know how to make the drink. (When made well, a cocktail I enjoy thoroughly, when made badly, I send it back and ask for a Campari-Soda)
In France, Italy, Spain: Depending on the mood, a glass of Champagne or Cava and if not that Campari-Soda.
I assume we're refering to a drink before a meal, in which case, sparkling wine of some sort: Prosecco, Champagne, or Cava. Stimulates the appetite and the senses, without overloading them.
"The sun, with all those planets revolving about it and dependent on it, can still ripen a bunch of grapes as if it had nothing else to do"
I'm amazed how many of you have already mentioned my favorite when I'm invited to take a pre-dinner cocktail: It's Campari and soda, in a tall glass with plenty of ice and a twist of lime or lemon for me!
My reasoning: I love the stuff with its pleasant bitter herbal taste. It's Italian, and I've got a dash of Italian in my Heinz 57 heritage, a smallish portion of my blood but a significant piece of my soul. With soda in a proportionate mix, it's got just enough alcohol to wake up my taste buds but not to spoil my appreciation of wine with the meal, or to leave me impaired at the end of the day. It's cooling in the summer time and quenching at any time. Campari and soda or me!

I am right with you, Ryan.... to the above I would add that sparkling wine is festive, refreshing, and a great way to start the evening. I have in recent years become more and more addicted to sparkling wines!
I agree with Lior about trying Campari and soda. I've never had one in my life and it sounds like I'm missing something.

"I don't know much about classical music. For years I thought the Goldberg Variations were something Mr. and Mrs. Goldberg did on their wedding night." Woody Allen
This thread also got me curious about trying Campari and soda. I want to see what all the fuss is about!!
For those new to the Campari-Soda, good to keep in mind that the drink is generally served in a tall, rather narrow glass (sometimes known as a Collins glass), the Campari already poured in the glass when it is served, sometimes three or four ice cubes already in the glass, sometimes the ice cubes served separately to be added to choice. The soda is most often served in a separate mini-container for adding the amount with which one is most comfortable.
Precisely how much ice and soda one enjoys is very much a matter of personal taste. My own choice is for two-three ice cubes, to pour over an amount of soda equal to that of the Campari for a first sip or two and then to add soda to about 2/3 the height of the glass.
I hate to sounds unoriginal, but I'd also have to go with Cava or scotch. I don't really appreciate mixed drinks, and both are great openings for a good meal.
I know that these days I am in an ever shrinking minority, but I believe that the dry Martini Cocktail* is one of the best drinks around to get those gastric juices flowing, and is perhaps the United States’ greatest contribution towards the enduring happiness of the human race.
I tend to like my Martini “wetter” than most theses day, making them with a standard Pre-Prohibition formula of three parts gin (preferably Plymouth) to one part Vermouth (preferably Martini and Rossi Bianco) and a dash of orange bitters, stirred with freshly cracked ice, strained into a small cocktail glass, and garnished with three green olives. Perfection . . . or close to it.
*Please note, the term Martini Cocktail refers to a mixture of gin and French-style vermouth, with perhaps a dash of bitters. Bastard children of this heavenly concoction, such as the Vodka “Martini,” and the Rum “Martini,” not to mention the Sour-apple “Martini,” may be good in their own way, but they are not Martinis.
I recall those days when a dry Martini had to be so "dry" that the gin was poured, the vermouth was placed in a perfume spray and someone would walk to the corner of the room to spray a bit of vermouth into the air. I always wondered why people were too shy to admit that they were simply drinking gin. But then again, such things were "fashionable" in their day.
I also recall the shock on the faces of many Americans when traveling in Europe and they would order a Martini, expecting a cocktail but getting a glass instead of Cinzano or Martini and Rossi Vermouth. That, of course, still happens but not nearly as often.

My wine shopping and I have never had a problem. Just a perpetual race between the bankruptcy court and Hell.--Rogov
Invariably, it's white wine for me. Would be bubbly if better bubbly were available and affordable by the glass, but it's not so white wine is typically my choice.
For a cocktail I would most often name a gin or vodka drink (Tom Collins, gin and tonic, etc.) or possibly a whisky sour (I like that sweet/sour combination.) In Hawaii I would ask for a Mai Tai and in the Caribbean something fruity with a good Jamaican rum. I find a gin and tonic, vodka and tonic, etc. very refreshing in warm weather. The whisky might be more attractive other times of year.

I'm trying to figure out how to go about setting the duration of this custom class feature to a value based on whether or not a different ability was choosen.
Other than needing to declare the variable (var duration as number) this looks okay assuming #hasability works as intended here, and you're timing is set correctly. Are you getting an error?
I'm not receiving any errors but the text is not updating as expected. If it helps I'll include everything below:
This is being done on a level 8 character and the ability with the ID of pngEleEBea was selected as the element boon.
It looks like the #hasability is returning a 0, which could be due to it not working properly or the timing, which can vary depending on the thing in question. I don't use it myself. This new check should work assuming you don't have a script that removes the ShowSpec tag for some reason, and ultimately performs the same function.
An alternative idea is to have the pngEleEBea thing assign a tag to the hero (such as User.EleBea) then you can check for the user tag on the hero. I would try the above method first though.
It's not exactly the same, of course, but it looks for the thing in question, then if it finds it, searches for the "ShowSpec" tag. In general, this tag only appears on things that are "activated". For example, the thing "Aura of Courage" exists on a character who is a level 1 Paladin, but the tag "ShowSpec" does not appear on it until level 3. A search such as the one above would return a '0' until level 3 as a result, even though the thing in question exists.

Lost amongst the hillarity felt by smug liberals to the conservative WHATABOUT President Obama golfing during Hurrican Katrina in August 2005, huh huh huh libtard?!?!? Oh and Michelle Obama is an ugly man, checkmate! Is the fact Propaganda has won. Conservatives have jettisoned their thin grasp on reality and fully immersed themselves into the fevered swamp of right-wing lies.
W(orst POTUS Ever) response to Hurricane Katrina was to let New Orleans drown, send Blackwater to murder black people, and allow thousands of Americans suffer because George W. Bush didn't care about black people. But, to conservatives, Hurricane Katrina was Obama's Katrina.
Republicans learned how to continually "catapult the propaganda" from their long association with the phony christian wing of their coaltion. Conservative christian creationists have been lobbing lies and legislation for 90 years since their defeat in the Scopes Trial in 1925. They didn't accept a defeat but, instead have been refining their methods.
Allen West Respublika posted a story, from Mark J. Fitzgibbons of The American Spectator which placed the blame for the White Terrorist Riot in Charolettesville onto the Democratic Governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic Mayor of Charolettesville Mike Singer and the Democratic Vice-Mayor Wes Bellamy.
A Department of Homeland Security memo from August 9th alerted the Unite the Right rally had the potential for violence between Anarchists and White Supremacists due to previous incidents in March and July. Of course, as is typical of right-wing propaganda efforts the entire event must be blame shifted to the Democratic politicans and violence must be the result of both sides.
So what would the right-wing internet have supported in response to this? Closing down the city of Charolettesville? Immediately arresting all people with tiki torches? Banning of hitler hairdos? Arresting and detaining all ouside agitators with out-of-state plates? Confiscating all weapons in defiance of the Holey Second Amendment. No, any attempts to deter, disarm, or detain the right-wing tiKKKi terrorists would have been proof of Obama's holdovers in the DHS Deep State outlawing conservatives or the evil DemocRATs of Virginia being all super racist against poor innocent whites. No, this is after-the-fact rationalization and justification for a right-wing terrorist get together.
Meanwhile, Mayor Singer and Charlottesville City Manager Maurice Jones are furiously attempting to blame each other, of mismangaing the incident, of being on vacation just prior to it (which they both were) as one wants to be the fall guy.
Just as we saw with the two Bundy Insurrections and the hundreds of incidents of white males conducting domestic terrorist attacks, Right-Wing violence and conservative domestic terrorism is coddled and encouraged in this country, so the blame can not rest with the right-wing domestic terrorists, tiKKKi Party, and Neo-Nazis but, must be spread around to both sides.
But, eventually the conservative internet will work around to placing the blame onto the Left as it always does. Just like when Faux News runs with a chyron of a criminal conservative being labelled (D). Just as with every deranged second amendment hero being recast as a liberal. Just as we saw with the Republican Witch Hunt of HRC for the incident in Benghazi, Libya, Republicans never wanted it known they had slashed the budget for Department of State security. Just as the response to Hurricane Harvey, Traitor Trump cut regulations on polluting chemical companies, a move cheered by Texas Republicans and championed by Congressional Republicans.
Remember the goal for conservatives is never to find the truth or to uncover the facts; The goal is to always, always, always blame liberals, minorities, and Democratic politicans and too always excuse conservative criminals, fascists, and Republicans.

Every writer dreads the process; on the other side of the proverbial fence, it is the joyful perverseness of the editor, with markers in hand and metaphorical scissors and knives to slash and cut, the necessity of reducing and whittling away the creative volume of words forming descriptive paragraphs and the infancy of a birth of genius, or so one always thinks about one’s own work. Everyone has a story to tell.

Most of what the law’s supporters call “sabotage” is perfectly legitimate political action. Obamacare’s architects envisioned a lot more cooperation from state governments than they’ve gotten so far. But the law allowed states to refrain from setting up insurance exchanges and from expanding Medicaid. States that exercise those options aren’t disobeying the law or even sabotaging it; they’re just making choices that the law’s supporters wish they would not.
According to The Jetsons, we should expect robots to clean our houses and do other working-class occupations that educated elites have historically looked down upon as “unskilled.” But anyone who has done such a job, or has watched an episode of Undercover Boss and seen highly-paid CEOs fumble while trying to carry out the demanding minimum wage jobs usually performed by their underlings, knows that there is no such thing as unskilled labor anymore (if there ever was), especially if you are comparing humans and machines in the same breath. The gap between humans and current AI is vastly greater than the differences between humans.
Between 1985 and 2008, they handed out roughly $1 billion this way. Had they been invested, one estimate says those funds would be worth almost $2 billion today -- or more than half the current shortfall in the funds.
These “bonuses” were used to lower the contribution the city was required to make, to give retirees a little something extra around Christmas time, and to fund individual savings accounts that workers are offered along with their pensions. In 2009, when the financial markets were completely frozen and the automakers were shotgunning through the bankruptcy courts, the pension trust paid 7.5 percent interest into those accounts -- which is about 7.5 percent more than they would have gotten at a bank. This while the pension funds were busy losing about a quarter of their value.

When Obama supporters tell you the great things the stimulus brought, remind them of the Denver tree giveaway.
“This fella said, ‘How would you like to have a tree in your yard?’ And I said, ‘Really?,’ “ said John Backlund, who lives in Denver’s Cherry Creek North neighborhood in a home worth more than $700,000.
Backlund said he could afford to buy his own trees but a government worker was going door-to-door trying to give away trees, so Backlund agreed to take a tree.

Republican leaders need to know they can't escape being the scapegoat. That's the only way the media sees it.
If you don't like the shutdown, you definitely won't like when the government seizes up and dies from lack of funding.
After being on the Senate floor for over 21 hours, Ted Cruz talked for three segments with Rush Limbaugh.
I have to tell you, I've had so many people... I've been off the past couple of days, but, while this has been going on, I've had so many people e-mail me so uplifted by what you did in the last 21 hours and what you did leading up to it. So many people are so happy that there finally is some leadership. They're so happy that, finally, somebody is doing in Washington what they were elected to do, what they said they were going to do. And I just wanted to say, before we started: I'm sure you're hearing much the same thing, but I wanted you to know that, while you're getting all these arrows as pioneers do, there's a lot of appreciation and a lot of love for what you're doing out there.
Have you heard of the Horse Act of 1884? The IRS has made sure H.R. Block, Jackson Hewitt and other taxpayers have.
Just heard Bill Bennett on the radio, answering a Tea Party person with "It won't work" about the Cruz strategy.
Hutto says that this summer has had more issues than years past, and that the video surveillance shows a range of concerning activities including drinking and even people relieving themselves.
The pavilion is currently closed at night, but the problem is that when people have been arrested for illegal activity a lot of the cases were being dismissed with the argument that signs didn't give sufficient notice.
Another risk is that a shutdown will contribute to an already growing sense of chaos and incompetence at the top. Obama can blame Republicans all he wants, but his party controls the White House and one house of Congress -- two-thirds of the elected levers of power in Washington. If he can't run the country with the White House and the Senate ... well, maybe he just can't run the country. After Syria, he's lost a lot of credibility abroad; if he can't keep the government from shutting down at home, he's likely to lose credibility here as well, no matter how much finger-pointing he does. Ultimately, if the country seems to be in chaos, it's the president who gets blamed.
Democratic state Sen. Janet D. Howell of Fairfax County wrote in an email to Young and others that she found the endorsement “incomprehensible” and that the response by Senate Democrats to the NVTC — which has never endorsed a Democrat for governor — “will be frigid and doors will be closed.”
There is some data to support the hypothesis of ocean warming, but nowhere near enough. And there are the several anomalies about why the ocean–but not the air–would be absorbing all the heat. And why the deep ocean, rather than surface waters? One of the leading “mainstream/consensus” climate scientists told me in June that he was “certain” that ocean warming explained the pause. I didn’t think to ask him just when or where the climate models had previously predicted that this might happen; that the temperature slowdown and ocean warming were surprises ought to tell us something.
"Firms are just very reluctant to hire full-time workers," Mr. Funk says. "So they are taking on more temporary help, which is what we do." ObamaCare imposes new mandates and penalties on companies with more than 50 full-time employees—and even those working 30 hours a week are considered full-time.
He quickly adds: "The problem isn't just ObamaCare, though. It's the entire regulatory assault on employers coming out of Washington—everything from the EEOC"—the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission hits companies hard when employees claim age, race or sex discrimination—"to the Dodd-Frank monstrosity. Employers are living in a state of fear."
"First you need integrity; second, a strong work ethic; and, third, you have to be able to pass a drug test." If an applicant can meet those minimal qualifications, he says, "I guarantee I can find employers tomorrow who will hire you."
In his interview, the Holy Father explains that the first order is salvation, and other moral teachings will flow from that. Pope Francis also explained that confessors must guide their sheep to salvation by neither being too permissive nor too removed from the sins plaguing their flock. In doing so, the Holy Father implicitly reiterates that these are sins, not merely equally acceptable lifestyle choices.
My only issue is that Pope Francis’ remarks are so easily misconstrued by the media. I don’t expect the Vatican to run itself around the neuroses of American media, but that is hardly an excuse for conducting itself in a way that plays into its hands.
iOS 7 is here. Downloaded it on the company's 4s today. Lots of new features. Big jump on the 4s. Gonna hold off on my personal i5 until... Lets see how my customers react first.
Forget the fact that the idea of a sitting president being so myopic, bubbled, and unwilling to consider alternate opinion is a little scary; what all of this might help to explain is why some are wondering if the New York Times is running the White House's frantic and widely criticized Syria policy.
As my colleague Larry O'Connor wrote earlier today, during the most schizophrenic days of Obama's decision-making process with respect to Syria, the president was in contact with a New York Times that was, at the time and with regular editorials, using its opinion pages to slow down Obama's unilateral march towards war.

Whole departments, whole offices subsidized by taxes and appropriations to non government groups who “aid” the mission of these has become the new spoils system and with the right party in charge can force the private sector by law to subsidize the public sector at their own expense as simply the cost of doing business.
Remember, the Politico was founded in 2007 by two former Washington Post staffers who wanted a harder-hitting vehicle whose reporting would delve into much more in depth coverage than the broadly-focused Post could ever hope to accomplish.
No really, stop laughing; that was the plan. But back on planet earth, while the Politico remains in teenage groupie mode over what they describe as Mr. Obama’s dazzling smile, others in the hermetically sealed world of the elite MSM are least gradually becoming somewhat aware of the president’s myriad flaws. But as Neo-Neocon asks, “They may be seeing Obama’s feet of clay—but then what?”
Aides maintain it never crossed Obama's mind to cancel the political speech as a gesture to the violent deaths of a dozen federal employees across town and their about-to-be-grieving families and co-workers. It's not like coming weeks of budget and debt limit arguments will lack for Obama opportunities to utter the same repetitive talking points with his fading rhetorical skills.

I do think that there’s one area where these recalls really are important. After the failure of the Senate gun-control bill, it was fashionable to argue, a la the Daily Beast’s Michael Tomasky: “You cannot oppose the will of 90 percent of the public and expect no consequences.”
It appears that you can. For one thing, that 90 percent number represents something of a best case result drawn from a best-case question wording; actual public support for, say, universal background checks is somewhat lower (though clearly still a majority). Perhaps, as I explained in April, the energy is all on the side of the voters who oppose gun control. For example, while Americans might support universal background checks in the abstract, in practice they just don’t care that much about it. Those who oppose them, however, care a lot.
Gun-control proponents had argued that Newtown changed everything. The Colorado recalls are a fresh reminder of how weak an argument that truly is.
And I would rather disagree with a case he made on American exceptionalism, stating that the United States’ policy is “what makes America different. It’s what makes us exceptional.” It is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional, whatever the motivation.

One thing that homeschoolers discover early on is that they learn along with their children. Most parents realize fairly quickly that there were gaps in their own education and they remedy the situation by plunging right into the learning process with their kids. With math, for example, parents not only review what they already know, but they fill in gaps as they work through the curriculum, progressively adding to their own skills as they teach their children. Many homeschooling books are designed to walk parents through every step of teaching various subjects, some even including video lectures.

Democrats think they have Republicans in a bind - they must support President Obama since they supporting military interventions in the past.
Even as the administration’s arguments become more strained, the political imperative that Democrats must support their president or risk having him “crippled” for the next 40 months is being drilled into them.
He would be great to never have to hear about Weiner again. But knowing him, he'll keep thrusting himself into the media.
In recent years, there have been a great number of issues on which Republicans took a side, only to abandon their position the moment President Obama agreed with them. By now, I imagine most of us can think of the list off the top of our head: an individual mandate in health care, cap-and-trade, the DREAM Act, a bipartisan deficit-reduction commission, at least some form of Keynesian economics, trying terrorist suspects in civilian U.S. courts and then imprisoning them on American soil, etc. I'm probably forgetting a few.
But each of the items on the list has to do with domestic policy -- Syria would break new ground. Obama believes military intervention is wise, so the normally hawkish party is quickly rediscovering its inner dove.
But Obama had grown frustrated with both international and domestic leaders who gave him tacit approval but declined to jump to his aid. He was taking all the risk and responsibility for a Syria strike, and he didn’t like it. Members of Congress were playing political games by asking him to consult with them but not taking on the accountability of voting with him or against him.
On Friday night, Obama announced to his staff that he was going to shine a spotlight on them. Rather than calling out orders for a strike, he called for a vote. Some of his allies patted him on the back for what they described as a bold stroke of political brilliance. Republicans said the president was being nakedly political.
President Obama feels strikes against Syria can wait for a Congressional vote - the targets are not time sensitive.
But you can support the office of President when the occupant bungles the run-up to the operation. For better or worse, at least since World War II many burdens have fallen on us more so than on other nations.
C. Obama is a well-meaning and sincere naïf, but a naïf nonetheless. He really believed the world prior to 2009 worked on the premises of the Harvard Law School lounge, Chicago organizing, and Rev. Wright’s Church — or least should have worked on such assumptions. Then when Obama took office, saw intelligence reports, and assumed the responsibilities of our highest office, he was shocked at the dangerous nature of the world! There was no more opportunity for demagoguery or buck-passing, and he had to become serious. In short, it is easy to criticize without power, hard with it to make tough decisions and bad/worse choices. He is slowly learning.
If you watched President Obama's speech Saturday, you might have been surprised he'll go to Congress first.

Lisa Scott gets snowboarding lessons at the home of New Zealand’s Olympic medallists and falls in love with the mountain.
Three cars had already come to grief in the Lindis. One sat, wrapped in accident tape, quite a-ways off the road in a field of thistle. The hoar frost made everything look soft when it was really hard, crystalline shards.
Wanaka hadn’t seen the sun for six days but we would, after turning right at the bra fence – tradition calls for women to leave their old bra on the fence before leaving town (because it’s seen too much?) – and taking the farm road to the sky, the inversion layer a scoop of cloud inside a cone of mountains. We were headed for a ski field founded 40 years ago by John and Mary Lee, who built this road to accommodate buses because Cardrona had lost its school bus due to a lack of children and it was either that or have more babies.
As we round Sally’s corner, named after Sally Frengley – “She lost my pocket knife!” said John, “I was terribly upset about it.” – we skid on a patch of ice, the precarious drop obscured by the hovering white.
Snowboarding was born in the ’80s when skaters and surfers took to the slopes on boards. Many ski areas decided the sport was altogether too reckless and, following a collision between a snowboard and a ski patroller, snowboarding was banned at Cardrona. The ban was lifted in ’89 after the then-GM was given a lesson and the country’s first half-pipe was carved out using chainsaws the following year. Cardrona now boasts the most exclusive park and pipe facilities in the southern hemisphere, sponsoring pretty much everyone who went to the PyeongChang Olympics plus big mountain and adaptive riders (the term “adaptive” comes from how both the sport and equipment are modified to individual needs).
Officially open from today, my recent weekend was a one-off “hello” with only a single lift operational. Even so, 1400 people showed up on the Sunday in question, proving there’s nothing quite like skiing and boarding where Olympians train.
Cardrona has invested in technology around snowmaking, but more natural snow was even then promising to coat the whole mountain.
Apart from a table of sneery 20-somethings who don’t realise how ridiculous they look, the place has the vibe of a small alpine town: babies, teenagers prepared to be seen with their parents, learners as unashamedly rubbish as me … the air of abiding kindness comes from its builder, a man who couldn’t ski himself but just wanted to be close to his family when they did.
Cardrona sees its future in a whole new kind of freestyle athlete, “which makes it buzzy for people being on the same slopes,” says general manager Bridget Legnavsky. “We’re a huge part of the development of snowsports in New Zealand. Over the last five to 10 years New Zealanders have begun to understand just how good we are. A lot of alpine sports are really, really old but when we took on park and pipe we became world class really quickly.”
As I ride the magic carpet, through New Zealand’s first gallery tunnel, to the top of the learner’s slope with Kyle, head of snowboard school, we spot Nico Porteous, New Zealand’s youngest medallist. He’s not wearing his bronze. I would wear that sucker everywhere.
I’d been snowboarding once before and accidentally got into the heli-ski queue. After the helicopter dropped me back, I spent the whole day falling over and making it up as I went along. Now, thanks to the random awesomeness of the universe, I was getting a lesson from the best.
“She’s a mouth breather,” explains the Mountain Man, rather disloyally. Kyle holds on to the back of my bibs and steers me around. Enjoying such an enviable amount of one-on-one, I pick up the basics fast and have a kind of epiphany: lessons are a very good thing. It’s a realisation tinged with regret. If only someone had taught me to drive.
But there’s no time for wallowing and hardly any waiting for the McDougall’s Express chondola (named after the proprietor of the Cardrona general store, which sat next to the hotel in gold-mining days.

I haven't noticed it but wouldn't care if there is. These forums don't create themselves, so the money to run them has to come from somewhere. If it's not coming out of your pocket and you still get to use them, you probably shouldn't care either;)
My point is that if a hobbyist or part time garage run small business guy asks a question he is told " this is a professional forum ask your questions else where" so if it is a true " professional " forum I shouldn't have to see a HD advertisement. What's good for the goose is good for the gander.
Not all the advertising here is from woodweb. Some of it looks to be google driven.i can't remember the exact term for it, but you might be seeing ads based on your own browser cookies. You search for purple widgets and google knows that so it remarkets to you in other places and you will regularly see ads for purple widgets.
Dan, you're conflicted and exposed. The HD ads have nothing to do with woodweb as Derrick mentioned. I don't shop at HD so I've never seen a HD ad here. The reason you're "subjected to hobbyist/home owner advertising" is for the very fact that you clearly search and shop at HD...stop being a hypocrite.
There is nothing in the guidelines that requests that only professionals read the forums. Reading of the forums would be welcome, and I'm sure there are plenty of non-professional woodworkers that use the forums and Knowledge base to look for answers to their questions.
The advertising will reflect that. Far better to concentrate on the content of the forums than the nature of the advertising.
By the way, I have found it quick and easy to click on the right hand column for all sorts of things needed in the shop. I like to patronize the sponsors since I like the forums.
The point I'm trying to get across is What's so wrong if a non professional hobbyist asks a question. This is a learning forum isn't it?
You're creating an issue that doesn't exist, read the forum guidelines...ANYONE can ask an informed question. Hobbyist and homeowner woodworking *questions* are discouraged. There's tons of diy/hobby forums, you seriously have a problem that this, being one of the only woodworking sites geared towards professionals doesn't want the forum filled with "my $150 bench top jointer isn't jointing properly, what's wrong? what size nails should I use to hang my cabinets with? can I use liquid nails to glue my pine table top together? type questions?! And you raise your issue under the guise of "non-professional advertising" which you have subjected yourself to because you frequent the Home Depot's website...come on man.
I strongly support that only professionals can post on this forum. I can go 40 places on the internet to read about table tops made from pallets that are cracking because they were screwed to angle iron, or why my Minwax stain doesn't stain hard maple a dark mocha color, or what is the name of this wood. But here we usually start with a fairly experienced group who are trying to make a living from their skills. Still some basic kind of questions from young professionals, but it's not 50 questions a day for free professional advice. I made my living for 26 years working wood, after 15 years as a mechanical draftsman and designer. It's just plain refreshing to have discussions with those who have done the same and are like minded.
If you don't like the ads don't look @ them. I see plenty of questions asked by people with little practical experience, and some times answers by similar. If you have broad experience or know it all maybe that will bother some. I have a little experience and will try to help when I can. Ignore what you can't control.

Seems that we are. We seem to be making strides on developing a positive food culture in our country. The cover of the July/August issue of AAA Living (Illinois/N. Indiana) announces "Fresh Perspectives: Agricultural Adventures From Farm to Market" promoting local agritourism. Midwest Living recently featured a story on farmers' markets, and amazingly there are now 221 farmers' markets in Illinois alone. But what really spoke to me was this week's Jewel flier. One entire page featuring succulent fruits and vegetables announced that Jewel sells local produce and was evidenced with a regional map pointing to places of origin. Now there is real proof of our purchasing power--when we can change business practices of large chain stores.

electric potentials arising in tissues and individual cells of man, animals, and plants; the most important components of the processes of excitation and inhibition. The study of bioelectric potentials is of great importance in understanding the physicochemical and physiological processes in living systems. It is also used in clinical medicine for diagnostic purposes (electrocardiography, electroencephalography, electromyography, and so on).
The initial data on the existence of bioelectric potentials (“animal electricity”) were obtained in the third quarter of the 18th century in the course of research on the nature of the “shock” produced by the electrical organs of certain fish in cases of defense or attack. The studies of the Italian physiologist and physician L. Galvani, who laid the foundation for the study of bioelectric potentials, date to the same period. A long scholarly dispute (1791–97) between Galvani and the physicist A. Volta on the nature of animal electricity culminated in two major discoveries: facts were obtained on the existence of bioelectric phenomena in living tissues, and a new principle for obtaining electric current using different kinds of metals was discovered—the voltaic cell was created. Galvani’s observations could not be properly assessed until fairly sensitive measuring instruments (galvanometers) came into use. The first such studies were carried out by the Italian physicist C. Matteucci (1837). The systematic investigation of bioelectric potentials was begun by the German physiologist E. Du Bois-Reymond (1848), who demonstrated the existence of bioelectric potentials in nerves and muscles at rest and during excitation. However, because of the inertia of the galvanometer, he was unable to record rapid oscillations of bioelectric potentials lasting a few thousandths of a second during the conduction of impulses along nerves and muscles. In 1886 the German physiologist J. Bernstein analyzed the shape of action potential. The French scientist E.-J. Marey (1875) used a capillary electrometer to record the oscillations of potentials of a beating heart. The Russian physiologist N. E. Vvedenskii (1883) used a telephone to listen to the rhythmic discharges in nerve and muscle. The Dutch physiologist W. Einthoven (1903) introduced the string galvanometer into experimental and clinical practice. This galvanometer is a high-sensitivity and quick-response instrument for recording electric currents in tissues. Russian physiologists made important contributions to the study of bioelectric potentials. V. V. Pravdich-Neminskii (1913–21) was the first to record an electroencephalogram. A. F. Samoilov (1929) investigated neuromuscular transmission of excitation, and D. S. Vorontsov (1932) discovered action potential in nerve fibers. Further progress in the study of bioelectric potentials was closely related to advances in electronics, which made it possible to use electronic amplifiers and oscillographs (developed by the American physiologistsG. Bishop, J. Erlanger, and H. S.Gasser in the 1930’s and 1940’s) in physiological experiments. The study of bioelectric potentials in single cells and fibers was made possible by the development of microelectrode technique. The use of giant nerve fibers of cephalopod mollusks, mainly the squid, is of great value in elucidating the mechanisms of generation of bioelectric potentials. The diameter of these fibers is 50–100 times greater than in vertebrates (0.5–1 mm), which permits the insertion of microelectrodes in them and makes possible the injection of various substances into the protoplasm. The study of the ionic permeability of the membrane of the giant fiber enabled the English physiologists A. Hodgkin, A. Huxley, and B. Katz (1947–52) to formulate the modern membrane theory of excitation.
The following principal types of bioelectric potentials are distinguished in nerve and muscle cells: resting potential, action potential, excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, and generator potentials.
Resting potential (resting membrane potential). In living cells at rest there is a difference of about 60–90 millivolts (mV)—localized on the surface membrane—between the cell contents and external solution. The inner side of the membrane is charged electronegatively with respect to the outer side (see Figure 1). Resting potential is caused by the selective
Figure 1. Diagram of measurements of resting membrane potential using an intracellular glass microelectrode (M). The second electrode (I) is placed in the fluid bathing the cell.
permeability of the resting membrane for K+ ions (J. Bernstein, 1902, 1912; A. Hodgkin and B. Katz, 1947). The concentration of K+ in protoplasm is 50 times higher than in the extracellular fluid. Hence, in diffusing from the cell, the ions carry positive charges to the outer side of the membrane. Meanwhile, the inner side, which is virtually impermeable to large organic anions, acquires negative potential. Since the permeability of a membrane at rest is approximately 100 times lower for Na+ than for K+, the diffusion of sodium from the extracellular fluid (where it is the main cation) into the protoplasm is low and only slightly decreases the resting potential produced by the K+ ions. In skeletal muscle cells, C1- ions that diffuse within the cell play an important role in the origin of resting potential. The result of the resting potential is resting current recorded between injured and intact portions of a nerve or muscle after the placement of deriving electrodes. Membranes of nerve and muscle cells (fibers) are capable of changing their ionic permeability in response to shifts in membrane potential. When the resting potential increases (hyperpolarization of the membrane), the permeability of the surface membranes for Na+ and K+ diminishes, but when it decreases (depolarization), the permeability increases. The rate of change in permeability for Na+ greatly exceeds the rate of increase in membrane permeability for K+.
Action potential. All stimuli acting on a cell cause at first a decrease in the resting potential; when it reaches a critical level (threshold), an active spreading response—action potential—occurs (see Figure 2). During the ascending phase of the action potential, the potential on the membrane is temporarily distorted, and the inner surface, charged electronegatively at rest, acquires positive potential. After peaking, the action potential begins to diminish (descending phase) and potential on the membrane returns almost to the original level, the resting potential. Complete restoration of the resting potential occurs only after the termination of trace oscillations of potential (trace depolarization or hyperpolarization), whose duration is usually far longer than the peak of the action potential. According to the membrane theory, membrane depolarization caused by stimulation intensifies the flow of Na+ within the cell, which decreases the negative potential of the inner side of the membrane—that is, intensifies its depolarization. This in turn increases its permeability to Na+ and again intensifies depolarization, and so on.
As a result of this explosive circular process—so-called regenerative depolarization—distortion of the membrane potential characteristic of the action potential occurs. The increased permeability for Na+ is of very short duration, and it then decreases (see Figure 3), with a resulting decrease in the flow of Na+ within the cell. The permeability for K+, unlike that for Na+, continues to increase, causing the flow of K+ from the cell to intensify. The action potential begins to diminish as a result of these changes, causing the restoration of the resting potential. This is the mechanism of generation of the action potential in most excitable tissues. However, there are cells (muscle fibers in crustaceans, nerve cells in some gastropod mollusks, some plant cells) in which the ascending phase of the action potential is caused by an increase in membrane permeability not for Na+ ions but for Ca2+ ions. Another unusual mechanism of generation of action potentials is that found in heart-muscle fibers, which are characterized by a prolonged plateau in the descending phase of the action potential (see Figure 2, c). The unequal concentrations of K+ and Na+ (or Ca2+) ions inside and outside the cell (fiber) are maintained by a special mechanism (the so-called sodium pump) which ejects Na+ ions from the

cell and forces K+ ions into the protoplasm. This requires an expenditure of energy drawn by the cell in the metabolic processes.
The amplitude of the action potential of most nerve and muscle fibers is about the same: 110–120 mV. The duration of the action potential varies widely: in warm-blooded animals, the action-potential duration of nerve fibers, which conduct excitation the most quickly, is 0.3–0.4 milliseconds (msec); in fibers of the heart muscle it is 50–600 msec. The action potential lasts about 20 sec in cells of freshwater algae of the genus Chara. A feature of the action potential that distinguishes it from other forms of cell response to stimulation is the fact that it obeys the “all or nothing” rule—that is, it arises only when the stimulus attains a certain threshold value, and a further increase in the intensity of the stimulus no longer affects either the amplitude or the duration of the action potential. The action potential is one of the most important components of the process of excitation. In nerve fibers it ensures conduction of the excitation from sensory endings (receptors) to the body of the nerve cell and from the latter to the synaptic endings located on various nerve, muscle, or glandular cells. Upon reaching the effector endings the action potential induces the secretion of a certain amount of specific chemical substances, the so-called mediators, which excite or inhibit the corresponding cells. In muscle fibers, the spreading action potential triggers a series of physicochemical reactions underlying the process of muscle contraction. The action potential is conducted along nerve and muscle fibers by so-called local or action currents that arise between the excited (depolarized) and adjacent resting portions of the membrane. Action currents are recorded

by ordinary extracellular electrodes. The curve is two-phase; the first corresponds to the arrival of the action potential at the near electrode, and the second corresponds to its arrival at the far electrode (see Figure 4).
Postsynaptic potentials. Postsynaptic potentials originate in the portions of the membrane of nerve or muscle cells that directly border on the synaptic endings. They have an amplitude on the order of several mV and a duration of 10–15 msec. Postsynaptic potentials are subdivided into excitatory and inhibitory potentials. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials represent local depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane caused by the action of the corresponding mediator (for example, acetylcholine in the myoneural junction). When excitatory postsynaptic potentials achieve a certain threshold (critical) value, a spreading action potential arises in the cell (see Figure 5, a, b). An inhibitory postsynaptic potential
Figure 5. Postsynaptic potentials: (a) subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potential arising in a nerve cell in response to stimulation of the corresponding nerve fibers, (b) excitatory postsynaptic potential that has achieved a threshold value sufficient for the origination of an action potential, (c) inhibitory postsynaptic potential caused by stimulation of inhibitory nerve fibers.
reflects local hyperpolarization of the membrane caused by an inhibitory mediator (see Figure 5, c). Unlike that of action potentials, the amplitude of postsynaptic potentials gradually increases with the amount of mediator secreted by the nerve ending. Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are summated in cases of simultaneous or successive arrival of nerve impulses at the endings located on the membrane of the same cell.
Generator potentials. Generator potentials originate in the membrane of sensory nerve endings (receptors). Outwardly they resemble excitatory postsynaptic potentials; their amplitude is on the order of several mV and varies with the force of stimulation applied to the receptor (see Figure 6). When
Figure 6. Generator potentials: increase in amplitude after intensified stimulation of a receptor (a-c). Upon achieving the threshold value (c), the generator potential caused an action potential in a sensory nerve fiber.
the generator potential reaches a threshold (critical) value, a spreading action potential arises in the neighboring portion of the membrane of the nerve fiber. The ionic mechanism of generator potentials has not yet been adequately studied.
In addition to the relatively quickly developing bioelectric potentials described above, very slow oscillations of membrane potential of an unknown nature are also recorded in nerve cells, smooth muscle fibers, and some plant cells. Volleys of impulses often arise on the crest of the wave of membrane depolarization.
All bioelectric potentials can be recorded and accurately measured only with extracellular microelectrodes, which make it possible to derive the difference in potentials between the inner and outer surfaces of the cell membrane. When oscillations of bioelectric potentials are derived from whole nerves, muscles, or the brain using surface electrodes, only the total potential of the multitude of synchronously or, more often, asynchronously functioning cells is recorded. The electromyogram is the result of the interference of the action potentials of many skeletal muscle fibers. The electrocardiogram is the result of the oscillations of electric potentials of muscle fibers in different portions of the heart. The electroencephalogram is the result of the summation of mainly excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials of a great many cells in different layers of the cerebral cortex. Although the recording of such interference electrograms cannot be used to analyze the oscillations of the bioelectric potentials of individual cells, it is valuable in evaluating the state of the particular organ as a whole. In clinical medicine electromyograms, electrocardiograms, and electroencephalograms are recorded using electrodes placed on the skin of the corresponding parts of the body. The information obtained by these methods is evaluated by comparing the changes in the corresponding curve with the results of clinical, physiological, and pathological-anatomical studies.
Materials and Method: A total of 30 hypothyroid patients of both sexes underwent polysomnography to assess sleep based on bioelectric potentials - electroencephalogram, electromyogram, and electrooculogram.
This result suggests that this improvement resulted from the facilitation of the muscular and neural functions of the quadriceps by HAL-SJ, which allowed the knee to extend fully because of the presence of a bioelectric potential in the quadriceps and the degree of feedback strength.

So rich is the mystery of the Eucharist that we have a number of terms to illumine its saving grace: the Breaking of the Bread; the Lord’s Supper; the Eucharistic Assembly; the Memorial of Christ’s Passion, Death, and Resurrection; the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass, the Holy and Divine Liturgy; the Eucharistic Liturgy; Holy Communion; and Holy Mass (cf. CCC, nos. 1328-1332). The use of bread and wine in worship is already found in the early history of God’s people. In the Old Testament, bread and wine are seen as gifts from God, to whom praise and thanks are given in return for these blessings and for other manifestations of his care and grace. The story of the priest Melchizedek’s offering a sacrifice of bread and wine for Abraham’s victory is an example of this (cf. Gn 14:18). The harvest of new lambs was also a time for the sacrifice of a lamb to show gratitude to God for the new flock and its contribution to the well-being of the family and tribe.
These ancient rituals were given historical meaning at the Exodus of God’s people. They were united into the Passover Meal as a sign of God’s delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, a pledge of his fidelity to his promises and eventually a sign of the coming of the Messiah and messianic times. Each family shared the lamb that had been sacrificed and the bread over which a blessing had been proclaimed. They also drank from a cup of wine over which a similar blessing had been proclaimed.
When Jesus instituted the Eucharist he gave a final meaning to the blessing of the bread and the wine and the sacrifice of the lamb. The Gospels narrate events that anticipated the Eucharist. The miracle of the loaves and fish, reported in all four Gospels, prefigured the unique abundance of the Eucharist. The miracle of changing water into wine at the wedding feast in Cana manifested the divine glory of Jesus and the heavenly wedding feast in which we share at every Eucharist.
In his dialogue with the people at Capernaum, Christ used his miracle of multiplying the loaves of bread as the occasion to describe himself as the Bread of Life: “I am the living bread that came down from heaven. . . Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you” (Jn 6:51, 53).

So I’m drawing 70 lbs and 27” draw on a Mathews no cam htx. I recently had my DL shortened from 27.5”. I had my arrows cut down and added 75 grain inserts. I was at 430 grain and 280 fps and now I’m at 476 grain and 250 fps. Shooting Easton axis 340 5mm.
I didn’t realize how drastic the drop was going to be out to 40 and 50 yards. I’m sure I have a TON of momentum and KE now but did I over do it? Is there a set up that would give me adequate momentum and KE and put me closer to 285-290 fps? Totally getting discouraged here on loss of fps and sloooooooow arrow at longer range.
Short answer is go back to your original set up. it will be totally fine for just about anything you want to hunt. BUT ... i have been bowhunting for way longer than i care to admit and i have tried all kinds of set ups. i keep coming back to heavier arrows. My average shot distance over 39 yrs of bowhunting has been 17 yds,with only a few shots over 30 yds. I practice at 45 and 50 but that's mainly to work on form and make the 20 yd shots feel easy. I love the quietness and forgiveness a heavier arrow gives me as well as the penetration. I suggest giving this new setup a chance this season unless you are consistenty taking longer shots. Good luck and happy hunting.
No Cam's aren't fast bows by modern standards (notice I said modern, I remember the days of being excited when a bow would shoot 220), so I wouldn't get too hung up on fps numbers. But if you were happy with the 430 grain arrow just go back to it. If you like how the 476 grain arrow shoots, how many shots do you really take at 50 yards? In 30+ years of bowhunting I have never taken a shot over 35 on whitetails. Having said all that I honestly don't get hung up final numbers. I bareshaft and broadhead tune my arrows and bows and where the weight lands, it lands. Unless my bow seems really loud to me, I don't get hung up thinking a need a heavier arrows. You have to shoot what gives you confidence.
So what I’m looking for is a setup that I can use for out west and whitetail. I’m just a little concerned that I went too heavy. My old set up had more KE and more momentum than I have now. I’m at 66 at KE and was around 73 before. Problem I have is with Easton axis arrows, is I can’t get high FOC without having a heavy arrow....
nothing wrong with 250 fps and a heavier than normal arrow. you wont believe the amount of folks who think their bow is faster than it really is. I ran a chrono at an ASA shoot and one of the most common things I heard was "I thought my bow was faster than that"
as far as the drop, remember, you adjust your sights to your arrow trajectory. at longer ranges, you either become very good at judging distances or range before the shot.
I shoot a 515 gr arrow at 268 fps and really like that weight. im even debating on adding another 50 gr just for giggles. I still shoot at the 100 yd target on a regular basis.
3) find a super light grain per inch arrow in the appropriate spine and load up the front of it with a heavier than normal bh. maybe an option
Biggest question that needs to be asked is how does it tune. At 60 yards, do your field points and fixed blade broadheads have the same point of impact? Shoot what tunes best, and gives you the most confidence. Adding a 75 grain insert is a substantial amount of weight up front and I would not be surprised if you are underspined now.
I have always shot heavy carbon arrows at and they are super quiet. My compound is quieter than most recurves.
So I was thinking about something in the 400-425 range. That will increase speed and give me more KE and Momentum than I currently have. I have passed the optimal point and have hit the point of diminishing returns
I have the same draw length and I'm shooting a 486 gr arrow out of a Mathews Halon at 249 fps. Trust me speed is nothing but a number in the Bow world unless your trying to shoot at far ranges with less of a pin gap. I literally am blowing through bones and shoulder with a fixed blade broad head with this set up thanks to Muddy Fuzzy. I also shoot a 450 gr. arrow of a BTX shooting at 262 fps. Heavy arrows with F.O.C is what I believe in now it gives me the confidence I need if I make a mistake
You can go with something like an Easton Hexx shaft in a 330 spine (7.9gr) and add a 75 grain brass insert. With a 27" arrow and 100 grain broadheads that puts you at around 420 grains or more if you shoot a lighted nock.
I was shooting light and fast arrows last season and hit a buck in the shoulder and got minimal penetration. I decided to go heavier and had muddyfuzzy build me a dozen. I'm now up to 520 grains. My 50 yard pin is bottomed out in my sight window but I'm fine with that because my bow is really quiet and my arrows hit hard. I shot them side by side with my old arrows into a round hay bale. My old arrows were sticking out of the bale 18 inches and my new arrows were buried all the way into the bale. I'm fine with a slower arrow thats harder hitting
So, after configuring KE and momentum, 420-430 grains is where I need to be to get the optimal performance out of this bow. Will give me right at 67 lbs of KE and roughly 265 fps. This should be sufficient for any animal in North America out to 50-60 yards.
Lol. I get what you’re saying but I need arrows and want to set up a great arrow that will work for anything I hunt. Once I set something up I’m done tinkering. I shoot all the time. Shot at 40 yards today with consistent 2 inch groups.

Dont sweat it, I shot a 27" draw length at 60lb weight, a 500 grain arrow at 239fps with Black Eagle Deep Impacts and 250 grains up front. I love how quiet my bow is and it shoots great..And I know I should most likely blow thru any thing I shoot at..

Guys on TBH are promoting high FOC arrows, and really don't have a good reason other than reading other forums.
I've killed traincars loads of deer and hogs without knowing what my FOC was, but my arrows flew straight.
My wife shoots a 46 lb bow, with a 25" DL, with an arrow that weighs +/- 290 grains and simply puts the arrow in the right area.
She killed a 135 inch deer on opening day in East Tx, and blew thru everything but the hide after going thru the off shoulder.
You may be wanting something different than adequate, but don't get caught up in all this "high FOC"
[quote=rocky;12816031][quote=DapperDan;12814496]So I’m drawing 70 lbs and 27” draw on a Mathews no cam htx. I recently had my DL shortened from 27.5”.

At 27", I seriously doubt your spine is weak with that bow, but the 75 grain insert may cause it to be.
You like Easton arrows, so look at their shafts and spines, and GPI, to calculate your FOC, and determine the speed you would like to shoot, and go from there.
A little bit. But shooting a no cam htx so it’s already uber quiet to begin with and I was shooting a 433 grain arrow before I made it heavier.
Ok, so, I’m over thinking. You ever over thought something. Of course you have. It’s what we do! Anyways, I have crunched numbers based off two different arrows I have shot and chrono’d. One is 433 grain and 264 fps and the other is 476 grain and 252 fps. Both are Easton axis. Based on all the math and crunching I was able to configure approximate arrow speeds for set ups of different arrows.
Looked at victory vaps, victory rips, Easton flatlines, and Easton axis (currently shooting). Based on what I have found is I can go to the Easton axis with a 27” shaft, 340 spine, add 50 grain insert, 100 grain BH, and after fletching and knock come in at around 430 grains and have a foc close to 12%. Momentum of .5 and KE of 67.
The 433 grain arrow I was shooting was 29” and didn’t have weighted insert. I was happy with around 270 fps in that arrow.
I have my arrows at 476 grain, 250 fps, and 67 KE. Why not pick up almost 18 fps if I am not really losing anything else? What’s the downside?
I went from 410 to 595 and it quietened my bow, made it more forgiving and more accurate, especially on longer shots. I would stay with the heavier set up. My pin gap is not as much as I thought it would be also.
heavy and quiet will always outweigh fast light and loud. Think this way, no bow is breaking the sound barrier so the critter will hear your shot before the arrow gets there even shooting 340 fps. quiet down the bow and make it harder to hear. maybe I'm flawed but that's my thinking
Ok. I have never shot a no cam. But a arrow at 430 gr at 280 fps is 74.9 ke and .534 slug-ft/s. Then you showing a 476 gr at 250 fps. Has a ke of 66.1 ke .528 slug-ft/s. That either means your calculating and your way off. Or you shot it and something is horribly wrong. You will not loose in ke or slug-ft/s as weight goes up.
KE is a marketing tool used by the archery industry. Arrow penetration capability relies on momentum. To dumb it down a little, Momentum is what keeps arrow moving after the point of impact. When it comes to momentum, there is no point of finishing returns in the realistic range of hunting arrows. Heavy is always good. Now, there are several other things to consider. FOC, Target animal, broadheads type and sharpness and bow tuned to perfect arrow flight. For Deer, there is nothing wrong with a 430 gr. arrow as long as all other factors are also being considered. Look at the Easton Hexx 330. You can put 75 gr brass insert up front, 100 gr head and weigh in around 430 gr. with good FOC. And when the time comes, shot placement is critical.
One other thing, a properly spines arrow with increased FOC, usually flies better than its lower FOC comparison.
Consider this....my wife gets pass throughs on elk with a 350 gr arrow, 25" draw and 47 lbs. It takes a good combination of all mentioned factors to get that performance for her.
Yes a good combinations. This is why the 12 penetration factored by dr ashby are a good to look at when designing arrows. And weight is number 12. So always a way to build a great arrow with out being overly heavy
1. Structural Integrity The most important factor of arrow penetration is structural integrity. If any component of your arrow fails, then penetration either completely stops or is greatly reduced. *
2. Arrow Flight If an arrow is not flying perfectly, then it’s wasting valuable energy that could have contributed to penetration. If an arrow impacts before it has achieved perfect flight, then energy is wasted that could have contributed to forward momentum and penetration. Perfect flight is crucial; you must achieve it no matter what the cost. Pay close attention to the other factors too though or you may find yourself shooting arrows that fly perfectly but can’t penetrate well at all. *
3. Arrow FOC (Front of Center) Tests have shown that EFOC, defined as 19% - 30% front of center and Ultra EFOC, defined as over 30% front of center enhances penetration from 40% to 60+%. *
4. Broadhead Mechanical Advantage Long narrow broadheads have an advantage over shorter wider heads. It takes less energy to push them through an animal. That is their mechanical advantage. This is second only to EFOC and Ultra EFOC as a penetration-enhancing factor. 5. Shaft Diameter to Ferrule Diameter Ratio You’ll lose up to 30% of your penetration potential if the shaft diameter is larger than the ferrule diameter where they meet. It’s best to be slightly smaller in diameter than the ferrule of the broadhead.
6. Arrow Mass or Weight Heavier arrows absorb more energy from the bow at the shot and heavier arrows carry their momentum better than lighter arrows, so heavier arrows penetrate better. Bow hunters should use the heaviest arrow that will deliver a trajectory they can live with.
7. Broadhead Edge Finish Broadhead edges that have been honed and stropped smooth have a 26% advantage over smooth filed edges and a 60% advantage over the coarse “serrated” Howard Hill edge.
10. Type of Edge Bevel Only if no bone is encountered, then the type of edge bevel ranks 10th. If bone is hit, and more often than not it is, this factor jumps up toward the top of the list. If you can’t get through the bone, penetration stops. The powerful rotational force of single bevel broadheads splits bone. Single bevel broadheads regularly turn what would be a wound into a killing shot. Note: Your arrow must be of sufficient weight and strength to drive the broadhead through and withstand the forces involved in breaching the bone.
11. Tip Design In all testing where bone was encountered, the Tanto tip performed best. It resisted damage and skipped less than any other tip design.
12. Arrow Mass 650 grains and Above When soft tissue is hit, this factor is ranked last in importance, BUT if heavy bone is hit arrow mass will be near the top of the list. Heavy bone is almost impossible to breach unless you have 650 grains or better in mass arrow weight.
My setup is 29.5" / 74lbs - 390 gr arrow @ 315 fps. I shoot the same setup for Whitetail, Axis, Mule deer and Elk. I have shot several Elk past 50 yards and never had a problem with penetration. Most don't passthrough as I try to hit the opposite shoulder.
Point being you were fine where you were - 280 fps & 430Gr arrow will kill anything in North America with proper shot placement.
If you hit solid bone on a Elk, Axis, Mule deer or even a big whitetail - it is not going to matter.
I can agree with you, but I would add one more thing. Not all 390 gr arrows are equal. If 390 is your number, try and build the arrow with more FOC, if possible.? It will perform better. Better flight, less effect from wind and will penetrate better.
I went to a heavier muddyfuzzy arrow this year as well. I was in a 28" FMJ 400 and now black eagle carnivore at 486grns. The black eagles are about 4 inches lower than the fmj at 30 yards. BUT they just about lift the block off the ground when shooting the top spots. And its quieter
If I shot a bow with a higher ibo I’d be all about this. A halon 32 at 70 lbs and 27” shot my 476 grain arrow 270 fps. My htx was 250-252. How do you like the black eagles?
Im shooting them from a heli-m at 28" and 65#. I cant tell you how fast or slow it is cause Ive never really chrono'd it. With either arrow. The video system Bowzone has showed in the 250-254 fps range with the FMJs
Inside 20 yards I can stack both arrows (busted at black eagle yesterday ). They hit the target like a train and group better outside 40. I havent shot an animal with them yet so thats still in the air. I did shoot under a pig at about 30 that seemed to hear the arrow or the bow one.
As mentioned, the furthest Ive shot an animal in my bow career is about 32 yards and that was a pig last week with the FMJ. Most of my deer have been inside 25 and passing through deer or breaking offside shoulder hadnt been an issue with the FMJ.
I asked muddy for an arrow that grouped better at longer distance and to hit harder and thats what he built me. No doubt about that. I cant remember the insert weight but they ended up 18% FOC with 100 grain heads
Your set up may work for you. But even if he was shooting the same bow as you he's 2.5 inches shorter. That's 25 ft difference. So your 390 at 315 would put him with a 390 at 290. In slug-ft/s he has 8.5% less force. I know that dosent would like much but it is. He has the same problem I have short arms. So we have to make it up with heavier arrows and different types of broadheads.
If you're really thinking of switching for the sake of speed, I would still recommend keeping it at or below 285. Beyond that it gets harder to properly tune browdheads. Sounds like you got that with your 430 grain setup. I'd just go back to that or find a similar 430 grain setup with more FOC
I’d be open to a 430 grain set up with higher foc if I can find arrows as durable and reliable as the axis. These things have been awesome for me. I’ve broken a couple but they either got stuck in wood or a friend broke a couple hitting hard plastic inserts in a deer target. They were glancing blows on the deer target. The wood one broke trying to get it out
Solid bone = Big Whitetail, Axis, Mule Deer or Elk if you hit the leg bone dead on odds are highly likely it will not break.
Years ago I personally hit a cow elk in the shoulder with a 485 gr arrow at 25 yards and the broadhead was the only thing with blood on it. The cow elk lived.
I've also seen a girl shooting 40 lbs with a 25" draw and a 280 grain arrow blow clean through the scapula and ribs on a big whitetail.
Again nothing wrong with weight, but it's more about shot placement. The original setup was more than adequate on any North American game.
I like my Black Eagle carnivores. You can really play with the FOC on them between point weights and such. As far as being tough, i can't really comment because I baby my equipment.
No. They are a .244 I believe or something like that. You may want to go out and shop for arrows to see what all out there meets your desires and go from there. You seem to have what you want narrowed down, which should make shopping a bit easier. A few companies to look at:
I did basically the same thing except shorten my draw.(heavy arrow + 75 grain insert) Went from 400 grain to 500 grain arrow. Like you I was a little taken back at the drop but I love the quietness of the bow and how well the heavy arrow shots everything(FP all kinds of BH same POE). Just going to have to pay more attention to distance. Before the change I was good out to 30yards....now if its past 22ish I need to consider bumping the single pin. DXT 28draw 65lbs
This is a summary of a recent Webinar in which Guido Scherp, the Coordinator of “Leibniz Research Alliance Science 2.0” (LRA) and Lorna Campbell, one of our Advisory Board members and expert in open education, answered some questions about the recent International Open Science Conference 2017.
The Conference, which had a special focus on OERs, was organised by Guido, and Lorna was an invited speaker with a keynote on “Crossing the Field Boundaries: Open Science, Open Data & Open Education”.
Guido: “LRA was founded in 2012 as an answer to the changing context of research, in particular the increasing digitalisation: researchers are now using blogs, twitter, social media, academic social networks and other various online-tools to share or conduct research”, a phenomenon that has been named ‘Science 2.0’. These dynamics are changing the scientific system by producing new outputs and new publication formats. The scope of LRA is to examine the effects of Science 2.0 and Open Science on research and publication processes and to provide strategic instruments for interdisciplinary research among member institutions that are open for collaborations with universities and other research institutions.
Guido then explained the difference between Science 2.0 and Open Science with the example of using Google Docs to collaboratively write a research paper, which is then published in a closed access journal. This would be an example of Science 2.0 which is not, however, Open Science. Of course Science 2.0 fuels Open Science, and vice versa.
Of particular interest for the Open Education Working Group was the thematic focus of the conference, which was on OERs. Hence my question on the reasons for this particular choice.
It was interesting to learn that not only within LRA there is a special interest group Open Science in Education, but also some partners of the LRA have educational background and are involved in OER-related projects. For example one partner is building the OERInfo platform, a central hub for OERs in Germany.
Lorna highlighted that it is indeed very timely to bring the Open Science conference under the umbrella of Open Education this year, as 2017 has been designated as the Year of Open, as a result of a series of anniversaries that are taking place this year. For example it is the 15th anniversary of the Budapest Open Access Initiative and the first Creative Commons licenses, the 10th anniversary of the Cape Town Open Education Declaration and the 5th anniversary of the Paris OER Declaration.
The role of resources like Wikipedia and all Wikimedia tools is very important in Open Education. Lorna nicely explained that “…certainly here in the UK we have an increased number of Wikimedia residents working at not just galleries and museums, but also at Universities […] and that is really about embedding open knowledge in higher education, so that Wikimedia effectively becomes a digital literacy tool and an open knowledge tool. So it’s not just about using the information out there but it is also about creating open knowledge by editing Wikipedia, using Wiki data etc…”.
For Guido, the most important element in this discourse is that Open Science practices must be taught: scientists (and the public) must learn Open Science practices and OER can be used for this. So the main point is to “apply open science practices when you teach open science”.
Lorna agreed that there are many commonalities between Open Science and Open Education, and that each can benefit from the other. “Certainly in terms of Open Education there’s a lot that Education could give from having greater access to open data of all kinds and I think that if students and teachers have got access to open science data for example, that’s an immensely powerful learning resource. Javiera and Leo through this working group have written a very important report on Open Data as OERs and I certainly think that’s one area in which Open Science can contribute significantly to Education. But of course there’s the other way and I think Open Education has a lot to offer to Science Education and Guido spoke about the importance of public engagement, and I think that’s an important area”. Lorna went on describing a recent project at Edinburgh University, in which students were involved in public engagement and created some OERs.
I then asked Lorna, referring to her keynote, if she thinks the boundaries between Open Science and Open Education are still quite rigid and, in that case, how we could contribute to loosen them up.
Lorna’s insight was, as usual, really interesting: “Well, I think this conference is exactly the way we can start to break down these boundaries. I think there is a tendency that we work in our ‘Open Silos’… we have Open Education, Open Access, Open Science, Open Data… and, you know, we are all working in one thing and making good progress, but there’s not quite enough inter-connection, I think, between these areas. So anything that helps break down these barriers could be a good thing, and especially conferences, like this one, that really extends the welcome to people working in education are really, really important” […] “A lot of this has to do with keeping these communication channels open, and remembering that we do have a lot that we can learn from each other. I certainly tend to see Open Education, Open Science, Open Access, Open Data as all part of an Open Landscape and we just need to go ahead, learn how to navigate them and reach across these boundaries”.
So, that was a lovely share of experiences and insight from both Lorna and Guido, which definitely contributed to a better understanding of what Open Science and Open Education have in common, and also facilitated critical reflection on what us, Open Educators, need to learn from Open Scientists (and vice versa).
It is particularly interesting to see that the Open Landscape seems to be inhabited by several ‘Open Silos’, but the boundaries are definitely getting more and more blurred.

Я почему-то уверен на 100%, что каждый человек задавался вопросом: «Что делать, когда все плохо?». Если им задать вопрос: «Как дела?», то получишь ответ: «Все плохо». Да, действительно бывает так, что и на работе проблемы, и в личной жизни и со здоровьем. Так сказать проблемы с тремя китами жизни, которые держат нашу жизнь. Здесь мы попробуем разобраться, что делать, если все плохо.
Corruption has no easy definition—behavior tolerated as normal, or at least necessary, in one place may be seen as deviant and punishable by fines and jail time in another. Yet all forms of corruption, even the seemingly trivial, erode the bonds of society. Corruption must be recognized for what it is: a looming global crisis.
The Summer-Fall 2003 issue of Open Society News reveals the variety of forms corruption can take and how its impact can be felt from Angola to Kazakhstan to Washington, D.C. It describes the pressure and intimidation that potential whistle blowers face from friends, colleagues, and authorities who extract benefits from corruption as it seeps through society. It focuses on the undisclosed deals between multinational corporations and governments that help officials enrich themselves at the public’s expense. And it shows how even strong laws against corruption in established democracies can be riddled with loopholes to benefit wealthy groups that dominate the legislative process.
In the early 90s I was privileged to serve in the board of the New York Council for the Humanities for a couple of years. One of their ongoing programs was an intensive summer seminar on a different humanities topic each year. The first year I was on the board the topic was Islam. As I recall, the seminar was under-enrolled that summer.
Clearly, women's issues are more than important. Over the years, beginning with close contact with the women's liberation movement of the late 60s and the 70s, I have come to agree with President Jimmy Carter on the urgency of stopping violence against women and with the many women who believe the unfinished business of the liberation of women is the key to solving the terrible challenges of the contemporary world.
I was disturbed not by the weight of the woman's topic but by the relative disregard for the previous summer's. Women's studies was already on the curriculum of many universities. There was no dearth of instruction. Islam, on the other hand, was terra incognita, blurred by the veils of Orientalism. A few years later everything changed, of course. As soon as airports re-opened, their bookstores offering passengers reading for their journeys were filled with books explaining the religion, the Koran, the life of the Prophet, you name it.
Yet, a few years earlier I was proud of the prescience of the organization I had just joined. Not that I was, or am, knowledgable. Hell, even today I know more about T. E. Lawrence (by the way, where is he when you need him?) than about anyone who's actually from the region. And my knowledge of the faith is sketchy at best. But some instinct told me my fellow board members had been spot on. This was the topic that was begging for a seminar for educated citizens. This was the big historical and contemporary phenomenon that was making a difference most folk outside its fold did not understand. Ignorant as I was, I just knew. Call me Cassandra. Or Ishmael. Sometimes I know shit.
The convergence between issues of Islam and women's issues is undeniable. But there was and is rampant ignorance of the former, while most citizens of the state of New York were either women or had close ties with them. None of my best friends were Muslims. The ones whose roots were in the Middle East were so secular I never even wondered about their religious antecedents.
Everything changed all too suddenly. And continues to change with the same violent suddenness. Even as it pleases me to have been part of an organization that understood what needed understanding and reflection, and it distressed me that such understanding turned out to be a voice clamoring -- how fitting! -- in the desert, I wished I'd made time to take that damn seminar myself, so years later I would not wake up to the news and wonder, along with so many of my fellow citizens, what the fuck was going on.

Technology is fast disrupting various industries across the board. Transportation industry is a good case to illustrate this point. Over the last 5 years the industry has been transforming really fast, not even giving chance to the established players to cope with the changes. Taxi industry is now dominated by players like Uber and Lyft. Car industry is fast moving toward automation led by technology firm such as Google & manufacturing is disrupted by Tesla, which has stated an electronic car revolution.
A firm should not only do technological analysis of the industry but also the speed at which technology disrupts that industry. Slow speed will give more time while fast speed of technological disruption may give a firm little time to cope and be profitable. Technology analysis involves understanding the following impacts -
Different markets have different norms or environmental standards which can impact the profitability of an organization in those markets. Even within a country often states can have different environmental laws and liability laws. For example in United States – Texas and Florida have different liability clauses in case of mishaps or environmental disaster. Similarly a lot of European countries give healthy tax breaks to companies that operate in the renewable sector.

Every once in awhile, I try to take some time to bring to the spotlight a person/group that is moving and shaking up the dance world. This past week as many celebrate Cinco de Mayo, I want to highlight Calpulli Mexican Dance Company.
Led under the direction of C-Founders Juan Castano and Alberto Lopez, the Calpulli Mexican Dance Company is dedicated to produce dance-based programming while incorporating live music to promote the rich diversity of Mexican and Mexican-American cultural heritage. Through its vision to be a cultural, educational and artistic institution, the company has three distinct areas of programming:
Through their touring company, they perform a variety of traditional dances from various parts of Mexico such as Veracruz, Jalisco, La Huasteca, Guerrero, and Oaxaca; dances for specific Mexican holidays such as Dia de los Muertos; and celebrating the cultural history of the country from the ancient Mayan civilization to the Mexican Revolution.
Through their array of programs, schools are able to access’ the company’s expertise on Mexican traditional dance and culture which adds value to the educational experience. These programs include:
Lecture Demonstrations/Assemblies: Dances performed from distinct regions highlighting their unique costumes and rhythms.
Instructional Workshops: Led by Master Teaching Artists, students learn a section of a dance and learn about its cultural background.
Residencies: Extended engagements where dance curriculum extends and connects with lessons in the classroom. Classes meet one or more times a week for several weeks and can conclude with a culminating performance in professional costumes.
These are free or low-cost programs and activities that are geared specifically underserved Mexican and Mexican-American communities. Held at their studios in Queens, Staten Island, and New Rochelle, the focus is to provide learning on the fundamentals in dance and music, teamwork, and supports a healthy and active lifestyle.
This week I had the privilege to speak with Tiffany Rea-Fisher, of the acclaimed Elisa Monte Dance Company (EMD) who was recently appointed to be the new Artistic Director for the company founded by Elisa Monte.
Tiffany comes from a competition dance background from California. Believe it or not, she actually had no intention to pursue dance as a career! Growing up, she didn’t know that was something you could do, outside of ballet. Modern dance wasn’t something she was familiar with.
When it came time to apply to college, she did decide to study dance and applied to a few schools. She ended up auditioning and getting accepted to SUNY Purchase. Unfortunately around that time, Tiffany had a knee surgery and SUNY Purchase was the only audition she could attend. As a student, Tiffany had the opportunity to do a study abroad program in Burgos, Spain. While she was there, she got her first taste of touring life as dancer.
After graduation, Tiffany was dancing with a group as part of the Lincoln Center Out of Doors series, Dance Anonymous in Cyprus, and Kyle Abraham/Abraham.In.Motion.
Tiffany had two friends who were part of EMD and wanted her to audition for the company, however she didn’t think it was a good fit. She later decided to do a workshop with the company. She wasn’t planning to do the whole week, but thought that if she got noticed during the first two days of the workshop, she would stay. And of course, that is exactly what happened! Elisa noticed her, and she finished the week long workshop.
Later on, Elisa was holding auditions for the company. Tiffany attended, but the odds were pretty high. There were 75 people who showed up for one opening. And to top it all off, it was not clear if that one opening was for a male or a female! But, Tiffany got the spot in the company. It was clear Elisa had taken an interest in her.
As soon as Tiffany joined the company, she had to step up pretty quickly. As she was coming in, a few company members were leaving. Tiffany was then given several lead roles. From here, she became a lead dancer for eight years.
In addition to being dancer for the company, Tiffany took an interest in arts administration. She was very curious as to how things worked and wanted to learn. During her first week with the company, Tiffany asked if she could intern administratively. The staff couldn’t believe her request, but she was very serious and they let her work in the office. Tiffany was very dedicated. She would come in early and work either before or after rehearsal. At one point, Tiffany asked if she could help write a grant for the company. She knew she didn’t have much experience, but thought she would give it a try anyway. The company did receive the grant. It was a 3-year grant for arts education programming. It was from this, she became the Director of Education for the company.
In addition to doing education program, Tiffany worked very closely with Elisa on touring, budgeting, and finance. She also shadowed many people in the office so that she could learn more about how the company operated.
As EMD celebrates its 35th anniversary, Elisa will step down from her role as Artistic Director at the end of their season as she passes the torch to Tiffany. 35 seems to be the magic number! Elisa was 35 when she started the company, and on its 35th anniversary, Elisa turns the company over to Tiffany, who will be turning 35!
As the new Artistic Director, Tiffany hopes to keep the budget in the black, keep choreographing, have a happy staff, but most importantly keep the EMD as the EMD. She has no intention of changing the company into something else. If she wanted to do her own thing, she would have done it already. If anything, Tiffany wants to preserve Elisa’s legacy. She does however, want to grow and expand the company by branching out to include technology and engage other disciplines.
When I asked Tiffany how does it feel to be named Artistic Director by Elisa, she replied, “I feel like a rock star!” She mentioned how it is very special to be handpicked by Elisa and is very honored to step into her new role. She is very grateful and couldn’t imagine being anywhere else! The transition was a long time in the making. Over the past 7 years, Tiffany was mentored by Elisa. Elisa was definitely grooming Tiffany for this role a long time before she even realized. She did have her fears about being accepted, all felt she was the obvious choice and the dance community has shown nothing but love and support.
If you haven’t gotten your tickets for the 35th anniversary season, be sure to do so now! This will be a show not to miss. Tiffany will be doing a solo of Elisa’s Run to the Rock for the opening night gala, will be participating in the alumni night performance of Elisa’s Shattered, and will have the world premiere of Newton’s Cradle.
The Elisa Monte Dance 35th anniversary season will be held at the City Center for the Performing Arts at Aaron Davis Hall March 2-5 with performances and a gallery exhibit. Tickets are $25 and can be purchased through the box office here or or the phone at 212-650-6900.
Last week I had the privilege to watch the documentary A Ballerina’s Tale on PBS. For those who are not familiar, it is the story about Misty Copeland- the first African-American female Principal dancer for the acclaimed American Ballet Theatre (ABT). ABT is one of the top ballet companies in the world and performing at the Metropolitan Opera House (MET) is one of the top venues for the performing arts. It is such an amazing accomplishment to be in the position she is especially as an African-American woman. She is definitely breaking down barriers as no one has done such a great feat!
The film briefly touched upon Misty’s childhood and her non-traditional dance training. Unlike most dancers, Misty started to take ballet at the age of 13. In dance years, that is very late considering I took my first dance class at the age of 3! To learn more about her childhood, I encourage you to read her book, Life in Motion.
At the age of 17, Misty moved to New York to join the studio company at ABT. She then had an opportunity to tour with the company. Misty talked about how she had such a hard time as there were days she would come home in tears. She said she felt so alone. I know from personal experience that it can be very lonely when no one expects or wants you to achieve. She also had no positive role models in the company. At that point it can be easy to give up. It can also make you doubt yourself.
Historically, ballet is built so much on tradition and traditionally, Blacks were not included in this art form.
One day I was watching a documentary on ESPN. It was talking about sports in the 1940s. In 1947, Jackie Robinson broke barriers as the first African-American to play for a Major League Baseball team- the Brooklyn Dodgers. However, around the same time there were no Blacks in the
National Basketball Association (NBA). Ironically, the NBA had its first Japanese player- Wataru Misaka. That struck me because in the 40s, the United States was at war with Japan and they rather have a Japanese man than a Black man play.
Too often have I read the bios of dancers in top ballet companies and find a large number of people come in from overseas. Not that I am judging their motives, but I do question why they rather bring in talent from another country than a Black person from here.
Despite the hardships, Misty continued to work hard. After being in the company for two years, she was promoted to a Soloist. That in itself was big. It was then she had the opportunity to perform lead roles in major ballets such as Firebird and Swan Lake. These are roles that have never been performed by a Black woman and roles traditionally reserved for Principal dancers. This was basically unheard of!
On June 30, 2015, Misty was officially announced to be a Principal dancer for ABT. She has opened doors for so many little girls who hope to come after her!
However, her achievement is no walk in the park. There is a lot of negativity and many don’t like her presence. That was heartbreaking to hear. But I do encourage Misty to be strong and don’t give up!
Dr. Lorenzo (Rennie) Harris is an award-winning Hip Hop dancer, choreographer, and Founding Artistic Director of the company Rennie Harris Puremovement. Born and raised in North Philadelphia, Hip Hop dance was very much a part of his life. In 1992, he founded Rennie Harris Puremovement- a company dedicated to preserving and disseminating the Hip Hop culture. His work encompasses the diverse and rich African-American traditions of the past, while simultaneously presenting the voice of a new generation through its ever-evolving interpretations of dance. Dr. Harris is committed to providing audiences with a sincere view of the essence and spirit of Hip Hop rather than the commercially exploited stereotypes portrayed in the media.
Conceived in 2007, Dr. Rennie Harris originally founded Rennie Harris Awe-Inspiring Works (RHAW) as a youth organization driven by community outreach, education initiatives, and a place of mentorship for teens and young adults who express interest to study and perform with his company- Rennie Harris Puremovement. With a focus on youth and urban culture, the mission of RHAW through theater performances and educational programming in the community- is to foster and cultivate the Hip Hop culture and preserve its legacy.
“I am inspired to commune with the humanitarian conscious of us all. My hope is to communicate to one’s primal self core being. In doing so, I have found we are reminded of who we are. This is what I call my “work”. The acknowledging of one’s spirit, of one’s right to experience, to love, to worship freely as it was intended. I am awestruck; I am inspired to continue touching people’s lives. Challenging realities through my work. This is my small but necessary contribution to the world at large. RHAW will carry on the legacy of freedom displayed in street dance and will do so by using hip hop & funk dance as a free expression. Proving once again that we the people have a right to be heard and to be loved…”
Today under the direction of Rodney Hill, the company has amazed audiences in cities across all 50 states and across the globe!
This weekend, the company RHAW performed at Flushing Town Hall in Queens, NY. The show focused on the history of Hip Hop dance technique in various styles of street dance such as Locking, Popping & Boogaloo, B-boy/girl, House, and Hip Hop social dances.
Following the performance, Mr. Hill and the core members of RHAW, invited audience members and young dancers for a dialogue to discuss what it means to be a professional Hip Hop dancer, the challenges of bringing street dance to the concert stage, and how to create works of Hip Hop dance theater.
I found this conversation to be very interesting. There were a few points that I would like to highlight:
Hip Hop has three basic rules- Innovation, Creativity, and Individuality. Unlike other styles of dance such as ballet where there is only one exact way to do the step, Hip Hop is about taking movement and making it your own! It’s not about conforming to look like everyone else. Be unique, be yourself. I agree with that statement. Hip Hop dance is always changing based on where and who you are. You will never see someone do a step the same as another person. I like Hip Hop dance because I’m never wrong! I can do it my way and people like my style.
Many of the dancers mentioned that they come from rough neighborhoods. For them, dance was an outlet that saved their lives and kept them out of trouble. And from that, Hip Hop dance became a way of life. Street dance is a lifestyle. Other countries such as Korea, Japan, and parts of Africa and Europe have come to do Hip Hop dance and do cool tricks from what they see in their interpretation, however, being one step removed, I personally do not think they have truly embodied and embraced the culture. I think they have made it their own, which is fine, but it is not of the true essence of the Hip Hop culture. (My thoughts on Hip Hop can go on, but I will leave it here and save that for another post).
Despite the fact Hip Hop dance has not been accepted as a respectable art form, the dancers talked about dance changed their lives in so many ways. One mentioned that dance helped him lose weight and get in shape. Another said that dance helped him gain confidence and overcome being shy. Another said that dance has opened her view of what dance is and can be. I have had very similar experiences as these dancers. Dance is my exercise. I’ve never been big on going to the gym, but I have kept in shape because of dance. Dance kept me so busy between class, rehearsals, and performances, that I didn’t have time to get into trouble.
In conjunction with celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy and as we begin to move into Black History Month, I would like to take this as an opportunity to honor the great Arthur Mitchell and the acclaimed company, Dance Theatre of Harlem!
Born on March 27, 1934 in Harlem, NY, Mitchell began his dance training at the High School of the Performing Arts in New York City. During his studies, he became the first male dancer to win the coveted Annual Dance Award and decided to pursue classical ballet professionally. Upon graduating high school, he received a full scholarship to continue his training at the School of American Ballet (SAB), the school affiliated with the notable New York City Ballet.
In 1955, Mitchell join the New York City Ballet, making him the first African-American male to become a permanent member of a major ballet company. He quickly rose to be a principal dancer, where he amazed audiences with his performance. Mitchell is most notable known for his roles in the pas de deux in Agon and the lighthearted Puck in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, both choreographed specifically for him by George Balanchine.
In addition to his roles with New York City Ballet, Mitchell also performed on Broadway, film, television, and in nightclubs. In 1966 he was asked to organized the American Negro Dance Company, which went on to represent the United States at the first World Festival of Negro Arts in Senegal, Africa and also founded the National Ballet Company of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro.
With the momentum of the Civil Rights Movement and learning about the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, Mitchell was determined to create opportunities for the youth to have access to dance where he grew up in Harlem. He began teaching classes in a remodeled garage on West 152nd Street. In 1969, with the help and financial support from Mrs. Alva B. Gimbel and the Ford Foundation, Mitchell founded Dance Theatre of Harlem (DTH) with his mentor and ballet teacher Karel Shook. The company has gone on to break down barriers as it has challenged the dance world to recognize and amend its stereotypes that ballet is an exclusive art for and by those of Eurocentric backgrounds.
Check out this exclusive video of UNCC assistant dance professor Dr. Takiyah Nur Amin and her thoughts on Arthur Mitchell and DTH. (Courtesy of Cecilia Whalen and Charlotte Viewpoint):
The company went onto have great success. Starting from its debut performance at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City in 1971, DTH has toured nationally and internationally, selling out performances, created a training school, and developed educational outreach program.
As many nonprofit organizations, they have their financial ups and downs. However, in 2004, with the debt totally to $2.3 million, DTH shut down its professional company for what was anticipated to be for one year, became an eight year hiatus. Focus was shifted to the school and education initiatives.
Today, under the direction of founding member and former principal dancer Virginia Johnson, the company is back and thriving once again. This company of 14 racially diverse dance artists of different shades of brown, performs a mix of classical and neo-classical works, while using ballet as a means to celebrate the African-American culture and bring new life to classical ballet. The company is currently on tour and will have its New York season at the New York City Center April 6-9.
As the year 2015 quickly comes to a close, I want to take an opportunity to bring to the spotlight Camille A. Brown, who is an amazing African-American young female choreographer.
Camille A. Brown is known for her introspective approach to cultural themes through masterful storytelling and political dialogues in her choreography. She is a 2015 Doris Duke Artist Award Recipient, 2015 TED Fellow, 2014 Bessie Award Winner for “Outstanding Production” (Mr. TOL E. RAncE), two-time Princess Grace Award Winner (Choreography & Works in Progress Residency), two-time recipient of NEFA’s National Dance Project: Production Grant, 2015 MAP Fund Grantee, 2015 Engaging Dance Audiences Grant Recipient, 2014 Joyce Award recipient with DANCECleveland, a Jerome Foundation 50th Anniversary Grantee, a 2014 New York City Center Choreography Fellow, and most recently a Jay Franke Davide Herro Fellow part of the United States Artists Fellow Program. She has created works for a number of companies such as Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Philadanco!, Complexions, and Urban Bush Women, and has danced with Ron K. Brown/Evidence and Rennie Harris/Puremovement. If you have had the opportunity to see Brown’s choreography, watch her company- Camille A. Brown and Dancers perform, or just listened to her speak, you will see how deep and dynamic she is!
September 2015 marked the world premiere of Brown’s latest piece, BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play. Accompanied by live original music by pianist, Scott Patterson and electric bassist, Tracy Wormworth, Brown draws on the unspoken rhythm and language among Black girls through various activities such as Double Dutch, social dances, and hand-clapping games. In an effort to reveal the complexities of a self-defined identity of a Black female in urban America, Brown seeks to create a platform that showcases Black girls being girls while telling their stories through a Black girl’s eyes.
Inspiration for this piece stems from Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship by Dr. Aimee Meredith Cox, The Games Black Girls Play: Learning the Ropes from Double-dutch to Hip-hop by Dr. Kyra Gaunt, and her close work with Talvin Wilks, a director and dramaturge. Brown looked to answer the question “What do you think of when you hear the phrase “Black girl?” as we find too often that our opinions are often shaped by stereotypes portrayed in the media and how exhausting life can become because of these preconceived ideas.
I had the honor and privilege to see this piece performed at The Joyce back in September. It was truly great to be in the audience. Often times when I go to see a performance, I enjoy it because I like the choreography. But in this case, I was moved because I able to really connect with the characters in the piece. It brought me back to the days when I was growing up with games and ideas I haven’t thought of in years! I saw myself on the stage, which doesn’t happen often. I saw myself with my friends on the playground or the park. I saw me hanging out with my friends as a teen and how those friendships have evolved now that I am an adult. What a wonderful piece! Click here to read more on my thoughts from a review I wrote for Broadwayworld Dance!
Conceived by Brown in 2014, The Gathering serves as an open forum for inter-generational Black female artists to come together to support and advocate for each other for greater cultural equity and acknowledgement in the contemporary dance world. It is the goal of these meetings to enhance visibility, understanding, exposure, celebration, notoriety, and sustainability of the African diaspora female choreographer voice, leading to more widespread acceptance, appreciation and publicity.
Through a collaborative effort between Brown, E. Moncell Durden, and an esteemed roster of dancers, musicians, and scholars,come together to explore African American social dances from jazz to hip-hop as part of a program at The Jacob’s Pillow School in July 2015. Emphasis draws on the aesthetic values and political histories embedded in the social dances while examining the influences and identities that remain embodied in the dances of today.
Featured on the cover of the August 2015 Dance Teacher issue, Brown’s Black Girl Spectrum (BGS) is a multi-faceted initiative that explores the spectrum of identities among Black girls and women while creating a safe space for growth as creative citizens. The program seeks to bring justice, wellness, and peace into the lives of Black girls and women, and use social dance and open dialogue for empowerment and community building. This program served as participatory research that informed Brown’s piece BLACK GIRL: Linguistic Play. To read the full Dance Teacher article, please click here.
2015 was definitely a big year for her and I see many great and positive things coming in the near future. Keep an ear and eye out for Camille A. Brown as she is definitely someone who will continue to do big things in and for the dance community.
The month of November, in addition to celebrating my birthday, is Native American Heritage Month. This is a time to honor and celebrate the current and historical voices of the American Indian culture in addition to the many contributions they have provided to the growth and support of the United States.
Efforts to gain a day of recognition for the Native Americans dates back to the early 1900s. Key players such as Dr. Arthur C. Parker and the Congress of the American Indian Association, both worked to gain recognition for American Indians. Some states such as New York in 1916 and Illinois in 1919, declared and recognized an American Indian Day. However, it wasn’t until 1990, did President George H.W. Bush approve a joint resolution, designating November as Native American Heritage Month. Today, this is a time to celebrate the diversity and richness of the American Indian culture, history, and traditions.
My tribute to Native American Heritage Month is to bring Louis Mofsie, to the spotlight. Mofsie, a member of the Hopi and Winnebago tribes, is the Founding Director of the acclaimed Thunderbird American Indian Dancers, the oldest Native American dance troupe in New York. Founded in 1963, the dancers strive to keep alive the traditions, songs, and dances they learned from their parents and grandparents; preserving and passing on the information to others that would have otherwise been lost.
Since its inception, the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers look to educate and expose audiences of the American Indian culture through performances, lectures, and workshops, and have performed in all fifty states and other countries including Canada, Israel and Japan.
The company prides itself in sponsoring the oldest pow-wow in New York City, which has been held continuously since November 1963! Over the past five decades, the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers and their events have and continue to be annual traditions for many people such as the Thunderbird weekend Mid-Summer outdoor Pow-Wow at the Queens County Farm Museum in Little Neck, NY, filled with amazing dance performances, intriguing exhibitions, and delicious traditional food.
Be sure to check out the Thunderbird American Indian Dancers at Flushing Town Hall this coming Saturday, January 16, 2016 with a performance at 2:15pm. For more more information, please visit Flushing Town Hall’s website here! Tickets are $13 for general admission; $10 for members and are available clicking here or calling (718) 463-7700 ext. 222.
Public school teachers, who died due to work-related sickness and injuries, would receive “funeral discount privileges” if Senator Nancy Binay’s bill is enacted into law. In Senate Bill No. 1670, which she filed on Monday, Binay sought a 20 percent discount on funeral services for families of public school teachers of the Department of Education and the Commission on Higher Education “who died on account of work-related sickness and injuries.” “The amount of discounts granted in pursuance of this Act shall be allowed as deductions in the computation of taxable…

“Give assistance to living teachers, not to the dead ones.” While appreciative of the proposal that would give educators a funeral discount, a group of teachers on Saturday urged the government to provide them incentives and other benefits while they are “still alive.” Teachers Dignity Coalition (TDC) said that its members appreciate the attention from Senator Nancy Binay who earlier filed a bill seeking a 20 percent discount on funeral services for families of public school teachers of the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED)…

The rear flange of the motors can be prepared for the mounting of the encoder. The customer has to provide the data for the encoder, that is position of the holes for fixing it and diameter of shaft. The shaft can be adapted too. If a standard ventilator is to be used the diameter must be 14 mm
An interesting possibility is the tachometer integrated in the bearing. We can also make the electronic interface for it and combine it with cost-saving motor electronics. (see:check list for PLC)

We have a new challenge at Aud Sentiments #198.. the theme for these two weeks is ANYTHING GOES + sentiment
For my card I used an old Judi Kins wooden stamp / the face.. I used some colored pencils to give some color to the eyes and lips. I used a large dot embossing folder for the base. I used Simon Says circle die and My favorite things die and sentiment.
Fabulous design Billie! Thanks so much for joining us at The Sisterhood’s ‘CAS ’ challenge and please come back again soon!
Great card! So blessed you joined our Challenge at Word Art Wednesday and hope you join us again in our current Challenge. Leaving you with the inspiration of God's Word in Psalm 31:24 which says, "Be strong and take heart, all you hope in the Lord." So sorry for my late comment, just been so busy!
Hello my name is Billie and THANK YOU FOR STOPPING BY: I am a wife, mother to four, grandmother, great grandmother, a sister and friend. I love to play in my craft room and create. We live in the country and have 2 little four legged kid.
All images and designs on this blog are the sole property of Billie Anderson. My work is for inspiration only and my photos are not to be copied for publication's or contest submissions. Thank you
The Parent and Baby Group welcome you to their regular Friday session. We meet each Friday in term-time. All Nether Edge babies, new-born to 18 months, plus Mums and/or Dads are welcome.
The English court remixes were my favorites, actually (especially the Allegro cross-examination theme). The OST only included them as a medley but thankfully the game itself lets you listen to each theme individually after you beat the game.
Another point for the professor! In all of the Layton games, once you solve a certain number of puzzles and get enough picarats, it unlocks the "Top Secret" section. I liked that you didn't have to solve all of the puzzles in PL vs PW in order to get to this section, too. And I REALLY wish Capcom did the same thing with the other PW games, but nope.
I felt the need to congratulate the fact that the Prof's theme is on a legitimate loop now. In all of the other Layton games, it's just Layton's theme as a separate song that plays over and over. In PL vs AA, the end of his theme actually loops around and links with the beginning, making it a seamless and continuous loop of nothing but Professor Layton's theme.
Anyone have good recommendations for other detective/mystery series? Recommendations for books and TV series are welcome (that includes manga and anime too!).
I have read most of the Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie stories, and have watched both the modern TV adaptations of Sherlock Holmes (the BBC version as well as the CBS version).
I am also a fan of Jasper Fforde's books, but he has not updated his Thursday Next / Shades of Grey / Nursery Crime series in a while. I also have watched quite a bit of Doctor Who.
I tried following the Detective Loki manga for a while but I find the detective/mystery elements a bit lacking...
Some in this list aren't exactly detective series, but the mystery is definitely there. And I'd say every single one of then is worth watching/reading.

Guests are not able to post messages or even read certain areas of the forums. Now, that's boring, don't you think? Registration, on the other hand, is simple, completely free of charge, and does not require you to give out any personal information at all. As soon as you register, you can take part in some of the happy fun things at the forums such as posting messages, voting in polls, sending private messages to people and being told that this is where we drink tea and eat cod.

Here's the write-up for the temporary rules governing the Space Age Relic Hunters adventure. This is going to be a trial thing to see how well it all works and how much people like it. Madea and I have worked pretty hard on this and we're excited to see what you all think about it.
IMPORTANT NOTE: We recommend that after reading these rules, you make a new version of your character in the relic hunter system specifically for this adventure and use the character template offered in this adventure.
This will require some proactivity on your part! We've created base versions of each character type equivalent to a Relic Hunter and if you don't create a new sheet with your updated character, we'll do it for you.
IMPORTANT CHANGES: Archive 2 is closing very soon, and the squads/members who still want to play will all be moved to campaign 1. Because this means that there will likely be an increase in panels, less characters will be shown in each panel to keep the strain on Donny down.
He's a great artist, but he's not a machine and it would be unfair to force him. Reducing the number of shown people per panel will also keep the time between pages around where they normally are.
What this also means is that there will be less failure for missed actions, and missed votes will ensure your character is not shown even if it would have been their turn. If many people fail to vote, however, I might be tempted into creative failures.
There are no factions in this adventure, per se. However, there are two competing resource-hunting ships from the newly founded Survey Fleet: The Ini'riia and the Quill'yate. Players from the Quill'yate will have red-marked armor, and those from the Ini'riia will have green-marked armor. As part of their maiden voyages, the hand-picked crew will be striving to make their respective commanders look good for Fleet Admiral Sillice, thus earning accolades, rewards, and a bigger portion of the Armada Budget for future mission equipment.
Due to the success and stability of the D.I.V.A. A.I. system over the course of the war, these new ships have been outfitted with Third Generation versions. Color-coded for your convenience, of course.
At the start of the adventure, a rough topographical map of the target area on the planet's surface, broken down into grid squares, will be displayed. Squads may pick a square as their starting point and use this grid determine movement in a turn. A squad can normally move about two grid squares per turn if terrain allows.
The classes work basically the same: Weapon Specialists (referred to as "Soldiers") and Mana Specialists (referred to as "Technicians" or "Techs").
We're solidifying the modification feature of Relic Hunters to better fit with the Space Age theme of the world setting. These "mods" will drive your capabilities, working much like the golem mods did, but with more variety while focusing the mechanic to take the place of the rather open-ended and undefineable mana arts system.
To start, only basic equipment is given. Improved equipment or mods will have to be found, purchased, or rewarded, AND SPACE SILLICE IS VERY SKIMPY WITH REWARDS!! IF YOU ACT LIKE THE SHAME OF THE FLEET, YOU GET NOTHING!!!! ( )
This slot is your basic weapon that adds to your squads ability to respond to threats. While all weapon specialists can use any of the weapons, you can only select a basic model at first. Weapon specialists can select from a variety of mana-powered plasma weapons: Assault Rifle, Sniper Rifles and Heavy Cannon.
Note: Heavy Cannon takes up both your Weapon and Weapon Mod slots (which means they cannot be modded, obviously.)
The basic starting weapon mod for the assault rifle is an enhanced Energy Cell, which allows for longer sustained fire. The basic Sniper Rifle mod is an improved Scope, which increases the range the sniper to any target in the entire grid if terrain allows. The Heavy Cannon is a Heavy Cannon.
The basic mod for Technicians, regardless of weapon, will be a Basic Targeting Assist, which improves accuracy to make up for a lack of combat training.
All players have a basic Energy Shield mod equipped, which is a personal energy shield designed to prevent you from dying if caught unawares.
The second mod slot is empty. You'll have to find new ones for this slot (budget cutbacks, you know.)
Everyone has basic rations, water and space future climbing gear (i.e., grappling winch) as part of their armor without modification. Additionally, Soldiers get one Tool slot, which is currently filled with an Emergency Medkit that will stabilize one team member.
These are basic infantry, wearing power armor and wielding heavier ranged weapons. They compare to Relic Hunter Weapon Specialists as follows:
(NOTE: No huge background for this adventure, please! A small paragraph at most, if you must, to indicate the economic background your character came from. And only if you've actually read the Space Age comic on Daydream.)
These are the Mana Specialist equivalents, wearing light armor and wielding light weapons in exchange for greater and more useful technical expertise in the field. The following affinities compare to Relic Hunter Mana Specialists as follows:
If you want to change your "affinity", please consider first that we've worked pretty hard to ensure that ALL specialities have their uses in the adventure to come.
Money is handled differently in this adventure, meaning that squad accounts are updated on spot and tracked by the ship AI. The squad can communicate with the ship at any time (barring interference on-planet) and request support from the ship (which will cost).
All squads will start with 10,000 starting credits, and a bonus based on their RH squad account balances.
Additionally, certain support requests will not be able to land exactly where you want them to (especially if not everyone was paying attention), which might mean a trek to get there!
Orbital Strike - 25,000 credits (Obliterates specified grid square and everything in it. In a justifiable dire emergency, you may (MAYBE) go into negative account balance which must be paid off before any other purchases can be made)
Medical Expert Team Request - 2000 credits (Call for a medical team to take care of any and all medical problems, fully healing all injuries.)
Supply Drop - 500 (Tool Kit Replenishment, also considers all non-tracked supplies like food, water, emergency air replenished. Dropped from orbit)
Emergency Shelter Drop - 500 (Drops a small reinforced shelter that can shield the squad from extreme environmental conditions.)
Casualty Evacuation - Free (This is for dead members, but be prepared for the squad to bear the "Shame of the Fleet" badge until Rasp reclaims it.)
Two ships from the Survey Fleet have been dispatched to a selected planet to find and secure resources to aid in the war effort. As this is a sector of space that not a lot of data is present on, it is unknown what threats await on the planet. As such, the ship will deploy squads of resource-hunting troops to find what they can.
Do we post something in front of their names to show that they are for space age ? A symbol or something to keep them from getting confused with our original RH charas...? ;
Will we stick with our original squad mates and team name or are we allowed to make whole new teams and leaders?
IS GENDER SWITCHING ALLOWED? ...since I don't see a ( same as in RH ) in front of it. :'D ( sorry for the nitpicks )
1) Nothing special is required in the names, since the char sheets won't be mixed up easily, and anyone who doesn't use an updated character will be auto-updated according to the rules.
The cost difference in having a Blood or Metal specialist in squad as opposed to calling one down, tends to encourage squads to have a Metal spec.
Or does the Repair team request also include mod installs? If the repair team can install mods, then reduce just mod install to 1,000cr.
Which of the Tool Kits have expendables that need resupplying? The x2 or x5 tool kits would seem to be expendable, weapon energy cells?
The grid system has me a bit confused, is that kind of like what's happening in C2 in terms of the maze thing at the top?
Also would like to point out that characters can not be created with the same name as someone who is already out there

Glasses are okay for aesthetic purposes. They will be space future glasses that look exactly the same as normal glasses. Or update your little character picture to not have glasses, alternatively.

You've basically answered your own questions. Mods and Armour as separate, as it said in the list. And the x2 or x5 can be replenished.
Note it says "Sample List" to give an idea of the things that'll be on there. It's not comprehensive yet.
To add to what Runes already said, it all depends on how the squads go about their missions. If a squad has three soldiers, a "blood" tech and a "metal" tech, then that squad will be very prepared to take care of themselves in the event they find mods (don't assume you'll find enough mods to make that worthwhile), but they'll be completely incapable of surveying resources on their own.
Costs will be comparable no matter what the party configuration; you're going to have to spend money for support no matter your configuration, but you also want to make money and come out ahead.
Weapon energy cells won't be tracked right now. The mod for assault rifles is basically a greater sustained fire duration, which gives an advantage in a firefight as you can go longer between reloads so it's a capability bonus.

More like what PtP has going on; it's going to be a view of the planet surface showing a rough terrain types within the mission area. What's actually in each grid square is not going to be detailed until the squad explores it. For example, say each grid is a square kilometer; that's lots of space to explore or get lost in.
Would it be acceptable to post character bios here for approval? I just want to make sure I did this correctly, and that my character's background is appropriate.
So, what is this Heavy Cannon? Is it the BFG 9000-like instrument of mass slaughter that I expect it to be, or is it a rapid-fire support weapon? Both would be most excellent...
Tur'geis Am'saag Sarghress - Leader of Melfina's Marauders Squad in Relic Hunters and all around hard-ass.
Personality: Cynical, but by-the-book and focused on missions. She has little tolerance for goofing off or unprofessional behavior, and can come off as cold, and somewhat uncaring. She does not smile often.
Raised in an orphanarium on the homeworld, the headmistress was a cruel and abusive woman. Zan'nah used an old TK-13 pistol the headmistress kept in her office to kill her in order to stop her from beating another of the children to death. Charges dropped due to her young age (the headmistress had quite a reputation as well) so long as she joined the military academy.
Graduated Military Academy with average marks in weaponized combat but did well in hand to hand combat and excelled at nanite use, almost immediately designated as a field surgeon, despite her lack of enthusiasm for the position.
Just like the title asks - is there a Russian Roulette effect that allows the spectator to make all the choices? I'm not intending to add any real danger to it - no spikes or anything that will hurt anyone. Just the basic plot of: all of these items will be eliminated one by one until only one remains, and that's the one that was predicted / written down / has something surprising inside of it, etc.
I'm not adverse to using equivoque or something, but I'm curious if there's anything out there that allows the spectator to have a truly free choice? (Maybe some gimmicked props or something?)
Working with a Spectator is a lot like working with a wild animal. You can guide them, you can coax them, and you can beat them with a stick but you can't always predict what, how, or why they'll do the next thing they do.
So using a dangerous element like a spike, nail, or broken glass bottle wouldn't work. Should they screw up and get it wrong you're set up for a nasty law suit.
So the only plot that would work is you trying to influence them, control them, or have power over them. It's almost a pseudo mentalist act in that regard.
You couldn't give them free choice because one in three or one in four cups has the loaded what ever in it. Murphy's law states that the spectator will find the one cup they're not suppose to 8 out of 10 times without fail. Murphy was an *** hole by the way.
The way I see it working is using an egg. Smash the egg accidentally worst thing happens is you have a mess to clean up. At least no one goes to the hospital.
As for method you'd either have to force a cup each time on them, or control their choices somehow. Maybe having them place their hands over two cups, selecting a hand, and using a magicians force to narrow the field down to just 1. or Have them remove one, then you remove one back and forth so forth and so on until one remains. You'd just have to be able to know which cup is loaded at all times and there's a variety of different methods to do that.
I'm not a fan of the RR plot that uses actual danger or risk of injury, so yeah, it'd be something like an egg.
There is an egg based routine out there called "Russian Roulegg" which is aimed at being a comedic piece.
Here is the problem you run into taking out the perceived danger: you loose that "tension" you cannot tell me an egg has the same tension a knife or spike does. SO, the question becomes WHAT are you trying to A.) Convince your audience and B.) Make them feel?
This keeps an element of tension but in a different way. Personally, I think it's better than a "non-dangerous" Roulette style routine and the choices can all be free ones with the multiple variations that are out there.
You could also substitute the money or "prize" in bank-night with the idea of a spectator winning back an item personal to them while destroying the other envelopes/containers which would also be a tension builder.
Right, I know a ton of different equivoque methods for doing it, I'm just wondering if there exists a way to have a spectator select something from a list of options without manipulative language.
Some bank night routines use the PATEO force. Can be worth looking into. Hector Chadwick has some great work on equivoque in his book.
I used to do a Poison Monte type bit in which 5 wine bottles were used, only one being safe. The helper made a series of choices and at the end my predicted choice is the one chosen and deemed safe.
In another routine known as "Dinner with the Borgia" a similar plot; 5 goblets with only one being "safe" and yet a committee of 4 makes all of the decisions while you maintain total control.
Aside from these I'd suggest that you study some of Rick Maue's idea like FINAL PICTURE and TERASABOS.
I'm familiar with TERASABOS but none of the others - can you give me some information on the stuff that doesn't belong to Maue?
There is a lot of discussion in Banachek's PS1 about the ABCD test and variations including Vernon's Five Card Force. Might even be some further discussion in PS2 related to stage performances- I'd have to check. Using traditional methods for knowing where the designated item is, Banachek's subtleties and equivoque as a last resort, you can construct a strong effect.
Why make things more complicated than they need to be? I do a six shot glass routine where one is filled with vodka and the others with nasty tap water. Just equivoque and use lots of showmanship. They will be making all of the choices, and if you present it correctly, they will perceive this.
It always irked me to see/hear people say, "Just do this method and use lots of showmanship," as if showmanship should come easily to a performer. I would argue that the vast majority of performers who believe they have showmanship chops aren't nearly as convincing (or entertaining) as they believe. Heck, I fall into this category on occasion, myself. Sacktavius, I'm not calling out your competence at all or even saying what you shared is untrue; I'm just saying that arbitrarily throwing out showmanship as an end-all/be-all answer, although arguably accurate, isn't very valuable advice. I just watched the screening to the upcoming documentary, Our Magic, and it's really inspired me to view magic in a wholly different light. There's a segment of the documentary that argues that magicians get a poor rap, because magicians don't respect what they do enough. I feel like I see that all the time on discussion forums, YouTube videos, and mediocre live performances at magic shops, conventions, and the occasional family restaurant... The documentary got me thinking about how we help one another as performers.
But back to the original post, catiecat-- Luke Jermay and Colin McLeod both have some of the simplest, most powerful opening roulette routines I've seen. They both played with the idea of streamlining the roulette to a 50/50 decision. As you can imagine, that significantly simplifies the method but also increases the drama of the effect. It also enables the audience to make the very important decision, themselves.
If you're after the more traditional Roulette plot, I've seen Marc Spelmann and Peter Nardi make use of the PATEO Force to facilitate the plot while giving the participant more leeway in making decisions. In addition to avoiding the danger in the effect, the performer is also able to predict the final outcome of the game due to the use of the PATEO. Pretty clever combination of principles.
Ok, perhaps "use showmanship" is a bit vague. Yet equivoque is probably the best way to go. Pick up a copy of "multiplicity" by Max Maven which actually explains HOW to use showmanship and make it convincing, and he shows you how to get rid of the arbitrary feeling that accompanies equivoque when not performed well. To be convincing, the spectator must have the impression that there was a deliberate selection procedure the whole time.
Because I'm comfortable with making things a little more complicated in order to have the outcome fit the presentation and routine I'm aiming for.
I believe Colin's routine is found in his book, Divine. Ellusionist carried it, but it's currently out of stock. You can still check out the trailer to the book at http://www.ellusionist.com/divine-by-colin-mcleod.html. The book is still widely available at most magic retailers.
If you're already familiar with Luke Jermay's rendition, Colin's is essentially the same-- it's just linguistically tweaked, and the reveal is different onstage. He wheels out two cardboard boxes. The audience "unequivocally" selects one to eliminate, and it is violently beaten down with a sledgehammer. The audience is takes part in the energy and laughs at the comical elimination of the box, but is surprised and ultimately relieved after one of Colin's friends/assistants pop out of the remaining box.

Yes, but I believe they require English to be the native tongue. I've seen Brits, Aussies, Canadians, even Scottish working there.
If, with your masters and all, you still needed a side gig for your comfy life, is it fair to say your main job had a perhaps less than good salary? Also, I thought you liked Morocco? Why work so much and miss out on all the fun and quality times? Oh yes, and if Morocco is good, why aren't you there? Just curious.
I'm used to working many more hours than I ever had to in Morocco - My work provided a decent living and time to enjoy it. Although I had personal/family reasons for leaving, I do expect to return to Morocco eventually and plan to retire there.
Usage Note: Scottish is the full, original form of the adjective. Scots is an old Scottish variant. Scotch is an English contraction of Scottish that came into use in Scotland as well for a time (as in Burns's "O thou, my Muse! guid auld Scotch drink!") but subsequently fell into disfavor there. In the interest of civility, forms involving Scotch are best avoided in reference to people; designations formed with Scots are most common (Scot, Scotsman, or Scotswoman), but those involving the full form Scottish are sometimes found in more formal contexts. Scotch-Irish is the most commonly used term for the descendants of Scots who migrated to North America, but lately Scots-Irish has begun to gain currency among those who know that Scotch is considered offensive in Scotland. There is, however, no sure rule for referring to things, since the history of variation in the use of these words has left many expressions in which the choice is fixed, such as Scotch broth, Scotch whisky, Scottish rite, and Scots Guards.
1. of or relating to or characteristic of Scotland or its people or culture or its English dialect or Gaelic language; "Scots Gaelic"; "the Scots community in New York"; "'Scottish' tends to be the more formal term as in 'The Scottish Symphony' or 'Scottish authors' or 'Scottish mountains'"; "'Scotch' is in disfavor with Scottish people and is used primarily outside Scotland except in such frozen phrases as 'Scotch broth' or 'Scotch whiskey' or 'Scotch plaid'" [syn: Scots]
RESULT 1 shows Scottish to be an adjective and a noun. The noun version being 'the people of Scotland' - therefore it takes the definite article: the Scottish
OCD agrees with this. The form of Scottish, when used as a noun referring to the poeple of Scotland, must be preceded by 'the'.
You added the emphasis - the dictionary did not, and they did not need the srticle either. Therefore, until you have published a successful dictionary. I'll go with what they said. Scottish.
I added no emphasis. You just mixed up nouns and adjectives. No need to wait until I publish a dictionary - just pay attention when you read the existing ones.
The situation in Morocco for English teachers in general is that it's getting harder and harder to get a work permit from the Ministry of Labor. There's a new step in the process where a newly created office has to decide whether the job being applied for can be filled by a Moroccan. So if you're not from an anglophone country, you're likely to get turned down, because they've got thousands of Moroccans who need jobs.
but I live in The Netherlands(I've got a Dutch passport), I've got an American accent (when I speak English) and in the near future I'm planning on going abroad to the U.S to work on my English.
With Moroccan nationality, TEFL qualifications, and good English, I don't see why not? But keep in mind that English teachers---Moroccan or foreign---are not exactly getting rich here --- especially a married couple if only one is working, and especially if you wind up in a city like Casablanca where it's really easy to spend money. So please, friend, Measure twice and cut once, look before you leap, (and all the rest of those homilies!).
Although most schools give preference to native speakers, the ALC has a few and AmidEast has at least one.
I'm not into it for the money, I'm using it as a leaphole to enter the Gulf world. If that's possible that is..
And if you earn about 800 or 900 euro's a month, you're like a king in Morocco even when you're married.
Yeah I know, that's why I'm planning to travel to a English speaking country so that my English can improve big time in a way I cannot be rejected by my knowledge and speaking ability.
Does anyone know how the Visa situation in Ukraine currently compares with the visa situation in Russia? Is it the same? Russia recently changed the laws so that teachers can only stay and work for 3 months. Does Ukraine offer a work visa for a full 9-12 month contract, or only three months as well?
Posted: Mon Dec 28, 2009 5:48 pm Post subject: Ukraine is going in the same direction as Russia with visa
So, do the schools issue work permits to the teachers which are hired so that they can stay for a full year contract?
I have a couple other questions as well maybe you guys can help me with. Are most of the schools still hiring native English speakers, and not being forced to hired only Ukranians due to visa laws. All in all, are there still some ESL jobs to go around in Ukraine for native speakers?
I would like to get my CELTA certification in the country which I will plan to get a job. It was between Russia and Ukraine since I am very familiar with that culture, and know the Russian language somewhat. I've already been accepted to the program in Moscow, but now due to the visa issues I am reconsidering taking the program in Urkaine. However, I don't want to dish out my money there either for certification if I will run into issues with getting a job and visa.
I do not know of any schools giving work permit today. I have had some people here tell me that a few schools in Kiev are giving them. But when I ask for names I never get any school names. So I can not beileve these people if they cannot tell me a school name.
The problem here is if the school gets you a work permit, they have to pay taxes. Then you must list where you live and then your landlord would also have to pay taxes on your rent. He will either refuse to be list or double your rent....
I've been doing some research, and appently plenty of the schools are still giving work permits to native English speakers, IH being one to mention.
Why do you say there are many schools giving working permits, but you only name one? I also can name hundreds of schools in Ukraine that do not. Please I am very interested in your list of additional schools.
Even if the school is kind enough to offer the work permit you must also find a land lord that will sign the paper.....many will not because they do not want to pay the taxes.
what happens if you don't leave after 90 days, stay a few more months and then leave? a bribe, a penalty, ??? incarceration??
lets say i left 3 times, payed a bribe to get back in, would it be roughly the same amount of bribe when i leave after 270 days??
There are schools here that will get you a work permit. These are also known as - The Only Schools Worth Working for. I don't know any teachers who come to Ukraine because they have to, so it pays to shop around and get what you need from an employer. If they don't offer legal work, why bother?
As for giving names of schools which provide work permits? Do some research. Some posters here don't like to give names of individual schools. PMs are best for such info.
It looks like the best deal would be to work on the Russian border (excuse me, CIS) and hop back and forth every 3 months.
I'm curious- are most teachers only staying 3 months and then heading on, or has the situation changed? I notice AEC posting for multiple hiring dates in the same ad these days.
It looks like the best deal would be to work on the Russian border (excuse me, CIS) and hop back and forth every 3 months
So, I wonder how safe it is, for a single young American (but "looks Russian" and speaks some Russian) female to hop back and forth by train every so often between Molodova and Odessa, Ukraine for instance? Does anybody know?

However, the abuse of a thing does not equal the thing itself. When applied in love, the historic Christian interpretation does not tell homosexual people that they are worthless. Rather, it tells them that their ultimate worth is found in the image of God that they bear (Genesis 1:27), instead of in their sexual expression. It does not encourage SSA Christians to hate themselves or deny who they are, but rather to find their identity in the loving Savior who gave his very life for them (Ephesians 5:2). It does not treat SSA believers as second-class citizens, but rather as beloved brothers and sisters whose gifts are necessary for the church to function properly (Romans 12:4–8).
The answer is: They have many weapons. They can do much damage. But they are disarmed of the one weapon that can damn us. The weapon of unforgiven sin. Be sure you see the connection between Colossians 2:14 and 15. In 2:14, it says God nailed the record of our debt to the cross. It’s punished. It’s finished. And in the next breath he says that God disarmed the rulers and authorities. He triumphed over them. Sure, they can beat us up. They can make us see weird things on the walls of our rooms. They can shake your house and cause lying signs and wonders. They accuse you and call you a loser, but they cannot damn you. That weapon is out of their hands. Only unforgiven sin damns. And that was nailed to the cross for every one of you who despairs of saving yourself and trusts in Jesus.
It is undefiled. It’s not tainted or polluted in any way. Everything we have in this life, even our most precious possessions, are marred in some way by sin, either because they’re human and sinful, or because they sometimes tempt us into sin. Families, jobs, friends, sports, music, they’re all good and can be loved and enjoyed for God’s glory, but because of sin — because of our broken, deceitful, sinful hearts — there’s nothing perfectly good or safe or pure in this life. But our eternal hope, our heavenly inheritance, will be undefiled.
“One word, Ma’am,” he said, coming back from the fire; limping, because of the pain. “One word. All you’ve been saying is quite right, I shouldn’t wonder. I’m a chap who always liked to know the worst and then put the best face I can on it. So I won’t deny any of what you said. But there’s one more thing to be said, even so. Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things—trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that’s a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We’re just babies making up a game, if you’re right. But four babies playing a game can make a play world which licks your real world hollow. That’s why I’m going to stand by the play world. I’m on Aslan’s side even if there isn’t any Aslan to lead it.

Now why do I say that? Why do I jump to that idea of meaning instead of just saying, “Well, no, no, they are not conscious on the other side of death. They really are undergoing something like soul sleep. They will have no consciousness until the resurrection?” Why don’t I say that? And the reason I don’t is because Jesus and Paul teach otherwise. So for example, the two key passages in Paul are Philippians 1:21–23, “To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that mean fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose, I cannot tell. I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.” So when Paul contemplates his own dying, he calls it “gain,” not because he is going to go unconscious and have zero experience for another thousand years, but because he goes into the presence of Christ with Christ in deeper, more intimate way — and it is, he says, vastly better than anything he has known here.

One of the key data points in any discussion of canon is something called the Muratorian fragment (also known as the Muratorian canon). This fragment, named after its discoverer Ludovico Antonio Muratori, contains our earliest list of the books in the New Testament. While the fragment itself dates from the 7th or 8th century, the list it contains was originally written in Greek and dates back to the end of the second century (c.180).
To desire that God enters into a covenant relationship with any modern-day nation is to walk backward in salvation history (Galatians 4:3,9). We dare not go back to the types and shadows of theocratic and cultic orders when we now have the substance to which they pointed (Hebrews 10:1; Colossians 2:16-17). That’d be like paying to see a trailer after watching the movie. Or, it’d be like our returning to animal sacrifices even after Jesus once and for all accomplished the redemption of His trans-ethnic people (Hebrews 10:4-10; Ephesians 2:11-22). More on that later.
I have recently become aware of a video on the internet that is making its way around the campus of the local university. Several college students told me that after viewing the video, it really made them question their faith. Now, this might surprise you, but I am all for questioning one’s faith (I encourage atheists to do the same), but if one is to question what they believe, it should be for good and logical reasons!
Atheists like Dawkins ask, “Who created God?” It is so ironic to me that when a theist tells them that nothing Created God, they laugh and will not accept that answer, but when scientists tell us that nothing created everything then they bow their knees in wonder and awe. Is this not ironic?
This week, Justin Bieber took his Purpose Tour to Sydney and had a pretty great message for the audience: “Mark my words Jesus loves you.”
Is Jesus really God? There are many cults and false religions today that deny it. The Jehovah’s Witnesses, for example, believe Jesus was created by the Father billions of years ago as the Archangel Michael and is hence a “lesser god” than the Father. The Mormons say Jesus was born as the first and greatest spirit child of the Heavenly Father and heavenly mother, and was the spirit-brother of Lucifer. New Agers claim Jesus was an enlightened master. Unitarian Universalists say Jesus was just a good moral teacher. What is the truth about Jesus Christ? We turn to the Scriptures for the answer.
Not only has apologetics bolstered my faith, but I believe it has helped me to "put a stone in the shoe" of several family members who are not believers. (the quote was from Greg Koukl). I learned what apologetics is and started studying in just as we were beginning to launch our kids off to college- so the timing couldn't have been any better. I love getting texts from my daughter when she is asked a hard question by a friend - like how can you trust the Bible when it has been handed down so many times, just like the game of telephone. What I love most is that I am now able to point her to the answer and that there ARE answers. I love your site! Thanks for helping me find relevant articles that I would no doubt miss if I was just browsing the Internet. I love that they just pop up in my newsfeed.
Pastors do you not see that it is your responsibility to adequately train the flock of God in reasons why the Gospel is true and reliable? It is not enough to preach a good sermon every week. People need opportunities within the church to learn by question and answer, by digging and discovering, by being challenged and learning to give an intellectually satisfying answer to objections to the Christian faith.
It took 14 hours for the delivery to be completed. Mercifully the process went as smoothly as possible. That day in the hospital was much different from the delivery of our firstborn, Graedon. It was longer and quieter. Our room was less busy. There were fewer monitors. Notably the one measuring fetal heart rate was absent. When the moment finally arrived, only the doctor and a nurse were present. There was no assisting staff waiting to receive our baby. No pediatrician ever came to perform an initial check and monitor vitals. Most painfully, no infant cry pierced the silence of the room. The only sound was Rachel’s and my uncontrollable sobbing as we clung to each other in sadness. I called my mom to let her know Eliana had arrived. While the nurse bathed her and wrapped her in newborn blankets, the doctor finished ensuring Rachel was okay before departing to another delivery room. Soon the nurse was handing Eliana to my wife before leaving us alone to spend our only moments with our daughter on this earth.
But what goes into developing a solid, reliable habit? What steps can we take, apart from raw willpower, to foster the instinct and enflame the desire to hear from God daily in his inspired Book? Don’t fool yourself that there’s any virtue in making Bible time as unpleasant as possible. Mere duty will not suffice for long-term motivation or biblical obedience.
I recall one conversation I had with a secular friend that was two hours long. We talked about why the world is broken. I started with the fall, redemption, and restoration. His reply was, “That’s a fascinating story, but what makes you think it is true?” I explained that Christians have been changed because of that narrative and mentioned that the community itself is an apologetic for the gospel. I then answered questions about all the evil Christians have done historically and what led to those actions. It went on for hours. It wasn’t controversial or argumentative. He had genuine questions. I had to have an open heart, an open mind, and a varied and authentic approach.
Here’s a quote for you: “A lot of what is published [in scientific journals] is incorrect.” Care to guess where those words appeared? Not on a website that questions the “consensus of experts on climate change.” Nor do they appear in a publication associated with intelligent design or other critiques of Neo-Darwinism.
In 1781, Allen began traveling the Methodist preaching circuits in Delaware and surrounding states. "My usual method was, when I would get bare of clothes, to stop travelling and go to work," he said. "My hands administered to my necessities." Increasingly, prominent Methodist leaders, like Francis Asbury, made sure Allen had places to preach. In 1786 the former slave returned to Philadelphia and joined St. George's Methodist Church. His leadership at prayer services attracted dozens of blacks into the church, and with them came increased racial tension.
Woody Allen once said, “I’m not afraid of dying, I just don’t want to be there when it happens.” But is death the end? If it is, then it makes a mockery of us, because it doesn’t matter how you live your life now, selfishly or selflessly, your ultimate destiny is worm food. In this seventh SHORT/ANSWERS video, Andy Bannister explores this question—and shows why it matters, not just for the question of life after death, but for how we find hope in the present.

If Christians continue to rely on emotion and ignore evidence, they will continue to lose their children to secularism. As Ravi Zacharias points out, a tepid Christianity cannot withstand a rabid secularism. And make no mistake—secularism is rabid. The world isn’t neutral out there. Today’s culture is becoming increasingly anti-Christian.
He pledged to publish “Authentick Accounts from Ministers and other creditable Persons.” On the very next page, Prince issued his invitation for ministers and other reputable sources to submit their accounts to him. Yet he also issued further detailed instructions for how ministers should organize their accounts. They should avoid personal reflections; [Jonathan] Edwards was apparently excepted from this clause. They should likewise avoid “angry Controversy.” But mostly, they must include their names. “Since to a nameless Relation of Matters of Fact, no wise Man can give any Credit; as he knows not but the Writer may be one of the least creditable Persons on Earth, and wou’d be known to be so, were his Name divulged.” Because the revival was a public affair, these ministers staked their reputations on defending it as valid. Critics could challenge their discernment as faulty, but they could not successfully prove that the events described in The Christian History were fabricated.
Doyle focuses on evidence dating from the Ediacaran Period, just prior to the Cambrian explosion. She weaves her plot around the story of a team from the University of Wisconsin-Madison working in Siberia. Photos show their tools beside unusual limestone rocks containing stromatolites and algal impressions. The photos don’t appear to show any Ediacaran creatures themselves. Indeed, those creatures play no role in her play, so they exit stage right: “The remains of these odd creatures, most of which have no evidence of a circulatory or digestive system, largely vanished from the rock record at the start of the Cambrian Period,” she admits [emphasis added], essentially agreeing with the scientists whom Stephen Meyer quotes in Chapter 4 of Darwin’s Doubt .
“It has always been difficult to understand those evangelical Christians who… say they serve the Lord, but they divide their days so as to leave plenty of time to play and loaf and enjoy the pleasures of the world as well. They are at ease while the world burns.” A.W. Tozer
God’s promise is that when we delight in Him, He will fulfill the desires of our hearts. If my greatest desire is for fulfillment that comes through living in the fullness of His love, He is eager to respond. The next time you’re tempted to turn to worldly pursuits for fulfillment, consider seeking God in a way that would ignite your passion for Him. The invitation is open.

Many Christian preachers, apologists, evangelists, and writers have taken heed of the declining numbers, but decades of pitting “Christian worldview” against “moral relativism” left habits that are hard to break. You’ll still hear Christians assume that the reason for so much rampant immorality in our culture is because people reject objective right and wrong. Many still assume that discussions over morals are likely to end with, “Well, that’s your truth, but I have mine.” Make no mistake: Disputes over morality are as strong as they have ever been. But if we view these disputes through the lens of “moral relativism,” it’s not only our understanding of our culture that will suffer. Our evangelistic witness will also be severely blunted.
In New Hebron, Mississippi, I grew up around poor whites who felt they were better than blacks and expected us to move out of their way when they were walking down the street. They experienced all of the advantages of being white. They were oppressors, and common knowledge through the years was that in rural areas, poor whites sought to become sheriffs, cops, or guards in order to have some power over society. So we did not have a great relationship with them. At the time, I didn’t realize these whites had also been damaged and that oppressing blacks gave them a sense of worth—a twisted sense of value, no doubt, but in their eyes, value nonetheless.
Here’s my answer to Lisa’s question. Christ indeed is our reward. Yes, yes, yes, Lisa. You got that right. See if you think this is wrong: Christ is indeed our reward, and everything else morally and spiritually and physically inside us and outside us in the universe — crowns, stars, cities, friends, family, great saints, etc. — everything else with him that will maximize the communication of his glory and our happiness in him, through it. Now, if God thought that Christ could be known most completely and enjoyed most fully by being the solitary object of our awareness, with no created reality as means, I don’t think God would have created a material universe in the first place, but only immaterial souls. He didn’t do it that way, and he’s not going to do it that way in the future. Christ is our reward, and everything else is our reward that more fully reveals him and more fully enables us to enjoy him.
Ho, ho, ho! Every Christmas, you can guarantee that some atheist, somewhere, will make the tired old argument: “Belief in God is just like belief in Santa Claus!” Does that comparison stand up?

In this episode of the Cold-Case Christianity Broadcast, J. Warner examines the statements of Jesus to see if He ever claimed to be God. While skeptics may acknowledge Jesus’ existence and even the value of His teaching, any assessment of Jesus’ instruction must account for his obvious claims of Deity. Jim looks at the cumulative case and assembles the evidence from the Gospels to demonstrate Jesus’ claims to Deity. (For more information, visit www.ColdCaseChristianity.com )

Daniel must rate as one of the most remarkable leaders in all of history. He ran two successive empires, and to him was entrusted enormous power. Despite this power, Daniel not only maintained his faith and devotion to God, but he also maintained his public witness to God. This book presents us with a cultural and worldview situation that is very close to our own. So often under the pressures of contemporary secular society, faith is privatized, but through Daniel we can learn to stand up and be counted in secular society.

When I listen to the outcry surrounding Indiana’s new law, I hear frustration with us, Christians. The outcry isn’t about the law, it’s about us. It’s a fear that we will discriminate. And it is a fear based on a history that, whether we like it or not, is ours. We have, in no shortage of ways, broken relationships with the LGBTQ community. We have expelled our sons and daughters. We have protested them. We blamed them for the ills of society like a scapegoat. And no matter what we believe about same-sex marriage, that is wrong. Because of that, restoring relationship and trust with the LGBTQ community is on us. Even if you disagree with all I said above, restoring the relationship is on us because we are called as followers of Jesus to be ministers of reconciliation.
But as far as I know, none of those sins are applauded so aggressively by whole groups of people who advocate for their normalcy. Sexual immorality is no longer the tip of the spear for the progressive push. Adultery is still frowned upon by many. Accusations of greed will still smear a candidate’s political campaign. Thievery is still not openly embraced, and there are no official initiatives saying it’s okay to go steal things that don’t belong to you. There’s no such thing as a drunk agenda yet. Most aren’t proud to choose a beverage over stability, and there aren’t any petitions that the government should abolish the driving restrictions of inebriated individuals. Reviling others still isn’t seen as the best way to win friends and influence people. Swindling, especially on a corporate level, usually gets someone thrown into jail. In fact, the infrastructure of the American economy depends upon, in some measure, our shared disdain for conniving scammers.

In the midst of his struggles, he repeatedly cried out to God. He spent hours meditating on the Scriptures, particularly the Psalms. He begged God for help in the midst of his trouble time and time again. He had no idea how to respond to the lack of healing, and, honestly, neither did I. I was 25 years old, and all I had heard about dealing with mental illness was that Christians just “prayed it away.”
The vast high-velocity moral revolution that is reshaping modern cultures at warp speed is leaving almost no aspect of the culture untouched and untransformed. The advocates of same-sex marriage and the more comprehensive goals of the LGBT movement assured the nation that nothing would be fundamentally changed if people of the same gender were allowed to marry one another. We knew that could not be true, and now the entire nation knows.
Yes Frank, it’s my opinion and I hope yours as well. I’m afraid “objectively wrong” is not an option we have available to us. At least I don’t see any consistent principle in the bible for making an objective decision about the right or wrongness of owning slaves. Isn’t the bible’s treatment of slavery a perfect example of the moral relativism that Christians are always accusing others of practicing? Do you need the bible or some supreme being to tell you that purchasing humans, treating them like cattle, beating and abusing them, splitting up their family units, raping them, emasculating them, working them to death, etc, etc, etc. is wrong? If I were going to utilize the “objective truth” of the bible (god’s perfect, objective, immutable (unchanging), inerrant, infallible, ethical, moral word) in an attempt to argue for the abolition of slavery would you have me appeal to Leviticus 25:44-46 “pass slaves down to children as property”, Exodus 21:2-6 “compel a male slave to remain a slave for life or forfeit his wife and kids”, Exodus 21:7-11 “sell a daughter as a sex slave”, Exodus 21:20-21 “beat a slave to death with impunity because he is your property” or Ephesians 6:5 “slaves obey your masters”.
Kneeling at her bedside after three years of family strife, my mother surrendered me in prayer to Jesus. While she was still there, the phone rang.

"There is no conflict between religion and science; Only the conflict between two sciences, that of the 4th century BCE and the science of 2014." Joseph Campbell. Your thesis irresponsibly confuses evolution and human progress with God-- with a fallacious Post Hoc ergo Propter hoc rationale. Since there is vast scientific proof of the former and none of the latter, we can readily dismiss it as just more sciolistic confirmation bias. A third grade understanding of the tens of thousand of years of human progress from the paleolithic, Iron age, Bronze age to the high Neolithic more than proves the evolution of human reason from the Hunter gatherers to Planting societies, to the stargazing Zigurat builders and the early foundations of the "good society". Sadly, what you are arguing requires an astonishing campaign of ignorance, or denial of history, science, and logic -- again negating the very point of your thesis. Belief in god presupposes nescience, not reason. Ironically, by arguing for the opposite you undermine your entire premise: Reason is not born of god, but of MAN and we have the entire anthropological record of man to prove it.
President David Alexander of Northwest Nazarene University (NNU) sent a letter to the campus over the weekend, defending the decision to lay off tenured theology professor Thomas Jay Oord.

@Jennifer I. Brand For hundreds of years, the English-speaking world accepted the usage of he/him/his as referring to a person of either sex or unknown sex. The words she/her/her were merely a special form of he/him/his signifying a female. Likewise, "man" could be used as a gender-neutral term for a human being. If the feminists knew what they were doing they would have promoted just getting rid of the feminine-specific terms "she" and "her," in the spirit of what Gene Roddenberry did in the first version of "Star Trek" in which every officer, male or female, was referred to as "Sir." Instead, they inflicted the idea upon us that using he/him/his was sexist, and we have been stuck with politically correct abominations like "he or she" or the practice of alternating he/him with she/her, even within the same sentence, when speaking of a human being of unspecified gender (the law journals followed this PC convention for a long time – for all I know, they may still).
A specialty high school, mentors and walking-around money for schools sounds nice. But empowering males of color requires a more holistic, comprehensive approach — one that deliberately seeks to end father absence and intimately involves women, the shapers of men.
Wow. This was exactly what I needed to hear. I ended up leaving an incredibly painful and exhausting job, even though it was what nearly everyone told me God was telling me to do. It was supposed to be my calling, but it was downright awful in reality. The farther I get from that experience, the more I realize exactly what you are saying, finding out your calling is as intricate and difficult as finding out who you were created to be as a person.

http://amzn.to/1F5euR0 Just where do the deep patterns of evidence for the Exodus manifest and where does fiction begin and fact end in the new movie Exodus: Gods and Kings? The provocative mix of fact and fiction in Ridley Scott's film “Exodus: Gods and Kings" raises interesting questions regarding the origins and actuality of the Exodus led by Moses. Scott and selected writers are avowed atheists who attempt a retelling of the biblical story of Moses and the Exodus. As non-believers, they take numerous liberties with the story as they intend to recast one of the foundational narratives of Judeo-Christian civilization. Some viewers may come away from the movie questioning their beliefs, wondering what is true. Questions like: Was the Red Sea really parted? Was Moses actually used by God to perform miracles to lead the people out of Egypt? Questions like these may arise when people watch atheist Ridley Scott’s “Exodus: Gods and Kings.” In response, the new book “Exodus: God The King of Kings and The Case for God, Moses, and the Exodus” skillfully separates facts from fallacy.
I am the Project Director for Ratio Christi's informational website "The Poached Egg" ( http://www.thepoachedegg.net/ ) which provides apologetics related news and content for university students and many more. Just as the apostle Paul had ministry partners, all staff members of Ratio Christi are required to develop a group of partners for their work with Ratio Christi. Partners have a personal relationship with the staff member, and are vital for not only the financing of this important work but also for their prayers for the personal ministry of our staff.
I think its a bit interesting that Mumford's rise to fame was in fact because they were offering something different than all the so called "arena rock" bands (Coldplay, U2, Kings of Leon, Imagine Dragons, Etc) and I thought their first album "Sigh no More" was great. Unfortunately, they tossed some of their slower, folkier material on Babel and became formulaic with their arrangements but it was still a great album. I must say I couldn't be more disappointed with them branching out or "expanding their sound" into an already dense field of arena rockers, and doing so by essentially copying those bands sounds. "Believe" sounded just like a Coldplay song, and "the Wolf" sounds like a Kings of Leon song. The pop audience will most likely love it anyway, as they seem to eat up whatever the radio is currently feeding. But as a roots/americana/folk/folk-rock fan, to me they just sound like everyone else now and that is truly unfortunate.
“I’ve met several of the women and their babies who have gone through the abortion pill reversal process. It’s just a beautiful thing,” she said. “Many times [women are] pressured to abort, and they take that pill and they immediately feel regret. For so many years, at Planned Parenthood they [have been] told, ‘Well, sorry, there’s nothing [that] can be done.’ We [Planned Parenthood] told them, ‘If you take the mifepristone in the clinic and you don’t abort your baby, your baby is going to have severe birth defects.’”

I have listened to part 1 of the Danger Signs broadcast. I like the points Mr. Carder's brought up and they are all good. I do however disagree with him that its okay to bring treats or have recreational likes with someone of the opposite sex. I think its a slippery slope. I feel your spouse should be with you in those activities or you should do them with same sex friends with the same interests. The treats and/or spending time with someone of the opposite sex can be easily misunderstood or as he says can bring up feelings and lead to something it shouldnt. Business partners should only be business conversation and you should not travel with opposite sex business partners. Take another along with you of the same sex. Its just too easy to slip and hurt your spouse. I speak this as a spouse who was betrayed by her husband - he had an affair with a co-worker. It destroyed our marriage and me. We are trying to rebuild but it is a nightmare that I dont know we will survive. I think Christians have to be extra vigilent and put fences up, more so than others, because the devil is out like a roaring lion and this is the easiest way for him to destroy families - and especially children who might turn away from Christ when hurt by a parent in this way.
I get it. When my kids were babies and toddlers, I came across the "mommy needs a cocktail" meme, and found it hilarious. Unwinding with a glass of wine after an intense day of parenting is not always wrong, but for many women, pills and drinks—are the main way they reduce stress, anxiety, or impatience.
Scripture gives many titles to the Spirit, both explicitly and implicitly. He is our comforter, advocate, and the one who regenerates our hearts and pours life into dust. Yet, there is one title that we pass over simply because of its familiarity: the Spirit is the Holy Spirit. He is holy in and of Himself, and Jesus sends His Holy Spirit to dwell in us in order that we might be holy. Long ago, the Lord commanded “be holy, for I am holy.” The Spirit of Jesus aids believers in their sanctification and their growth in the image of our holy Savior.
Becoming Worldly Saints traces the cohesive story of salvation between Genesis and Revelation. This recapitulation recovers a lot of earthly good, especially for readers who grew up, like Wittmer, singing about the rapturous occasion of the "roll being called up yonder." From the doctrine of creation, Wittmer defends material enjoyment. If God made a good world for us to inhabit, we should take "wholesome" delight in created good without guilt. Arguing from the Incarnation and Resurrection, Wittmer defends "God's enthusiastic embrace of the material world." His argument has eschatological import: Heaven is not a sky kingdom, which we'll inhabit in ghostly form. Heaven is coming to earth in the form of a city, and through faith in Christ we'll become residents of the New Jerusalem in resurrected bodies. "If you enjoy being human and you enjoy being here, you are going to love the new earth."
When you include getting ready, commuting and winding down, work dominates the majority of our waking hours. And yet over 1 million people lose their jobs each year in America. Minimalists see these trends and find ways to simplify their work routines. They work more hours on fewer days. They work from home a few days each week. Instead of a pay raise, they negotiate in hours cut or extra vacation time. They slowly transition from their day job to their dream job.
Larry, you are quick to label people of Faith as bigots, but you continue to express the most bigoted statements against Christians, exemplifying how bigotry is a two-way street. Cardinal Wuerl recently stated on a Sunday television news interview that those who push the gay agenda, do not want a resolution that recognizes both sides of this issue, they only want it to be a one way resolution, effectively stripping the religious side of their Constitutional rights in the matter. As far as I am concerned, this article is spot on. And if a Christian, who wants to spend his eternity in heaven, must abide by his Faith, and cannot in good conscience support the gay agenda, you equally cannot in the slightest manner understand the religious perspective. And that is okay. But I would not want to start calling you a bigot. But if Christians such as myself are indeed bigots, then it applies likewise.
NEW YORK — Rev. Emerson Boyce, the general secretary of the Evangelical Association of the Caribbean, discussed living conditions in the region and how he's working to prepare Christians in the island nations for future persecution that believers are witnessing throughout the Middle East, Africa and Asia.
Moreover, there has long been an understanding that those present at a marriage ceremony are not just casual observers, but are witnesses granting their approval and support for the vows that are to be made. That’s why the traditional language speaks of gathering “here in the sight of God, and in the face of this congregation.” That’s why one of the sample marriage services in the PCA still has the minister say, “If any man can show just cause why they may not lawfully be wedded, let him now declare it, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.” Quite explicitly, the wedding is not a party for friends and family. It’s not a mere ceremonial formality. It is a divine event in which those gathered celebrate and honor the “solemnization of matrimony.” Which is why–as much as I might want to build bridges with a lesbian friend or reassure a gay family member that I care for him and want to have a relationship with him–I would not attend a same-sex wedding ceremony. I cannot help with my cake, with my flowers, or with my presence to solemnize what is not holy.
It’s hard to get cuter than these crochet character bookmarks, whose heads protrude from the top of the book to mark where you left off. The attention to detail is amazing: The Cowardly Lion has a silver badge of courage, the Mad Hatter is holding a teapot, and the wolf that ate Little Red Riding Hood’s granny has glasses on his nose.
To know Martyn Lloyd-Jones is to read him. Hundreds of his sermons are available in print and have influenced at least two generations of preachers.

This biblical, Reformed, emphasis entails that any person to whom we defend the faith is one who already and always knows the true God, and they know God by knowing creation. Since that is the case, any argument we give for the truth of Christianity must take account of the knowledge that is already given by God, and continues to be given, in and through all of creation. In taking account of this God-given-and-giving knowledge, we dare not approach those who oppose Christianity as if they are not aware of such things. We speak and defend the faith to image-bearers who know God. This truth may not need to be stated to them explicitly, but it cannot be ignored as we speak. We cannot take at face value the unbeliever's diagnosis of his own condition. Neither can we think that his "rationality" is neutral with respect to his relationship to God, which leads to the second point in the quote above.
Susan Sarandon's Nephew Blasts New Jersey Catholic School for Rehiring Teacher Who Made 'Anti-Gay' Comments on Facebook
Actress Susan Sarandon's nephew made headlines on Sunday when responding to a teacher's rehiring at a Catholic school in New Jersey after she was dismissed in March for posting a comment on Facebook that some perceived as anti-gay.
This call to purity is precisely why we see a pattern emerge in the violence of the Old Testament. While God fights for his people in their faithful obedience, he fights against his unfaithful people in their sinful rebellion. Victory for the pure; defeat for the impure. Exodus for the faithful; exile for the unfaithful. It’s not until the perfect life of Christ that a new Israel comes as the only faithful One of God and achieves the ultimate crown of victory.
Rick Warren Speaks Out as a Pastor and Father Against California Bill Allowing Terminally Ill People to End Their Lives

When Software Projects become larger and more people is involved, there's need to keep control of source code files.
Usually, several users have to make changes at the same time in a core file. Doing this the wrong way may lead to delete changes made by a developer, wasting a lot of time and raising errors in the coding.
Fortunately, there's Version Control software which keeps track of who is using a file, keep versions of that files, allows merging, branching and other cool stuff to keep your software project synchronized.
There are several vendors and open open source versions of this software, and a couple of models. Please check the List of Revision Control Software.
In this case we are going to setup a Control software using a Client-Server model with an open source application.
VisualSVN is our choice, because it's Open Source, provides an easy installation package and a clean control panel. Just download it from VisualSVN. After downloading, run the setup and follow the wizard:
Next, set install location and repositories path. Repository is where the files will be physically located (Please do not modify anything inside repositories unless you know exactly what are you doing). Also, set the server port. VisualSVN Server runs on Apache server and it can be accessed through http protocol, that is, you can have some access using a web browser.
First of all you have to create the users who will have access to the repository by clicking on the "Create new user" link.
Final step in the server side is create the New Repository, that is, the particular space where the application files will be stored. I created a sample for this:
You can check if your system is running properly by logging to the VisualSVN server location using a web browser (As I am running local, I just entered localhost:8080/svn/SimpleSample):
Just remember you log in using the SVN user you created previously. You can create a user for each developer, so when you track changes you can view who modified the application by the means of this user.

Every time after a great crazy sex party I think I'll never see a hotter and sexier bash. But the latest dr.unk sex party we threw on the riverside was fucking amazing! As far as I'm concerned it's the best footage we ever filmed for student sex parties. The four girls we invited are very cute and really fun. As if they were meant for partying. You've probably seen most of them before cause they are our so-called hot sex friends. They were happy to spend great time on the beach with us, drinking beer and champagne, fucking and eating fried sausages!
Everytime we gather for hardcore sex parties we play various games cause they do bring more fun to the action. Most simple are guess games. Like "Guess the tits size" and stuff like that. The loser is punished, and the winner gets a special prize: deep blowjob outdoors or even dr.unk girls sex. It usually depends on how dr.unk the girl is :) So when Edik won a guess game, he left for a hot beach fucking with a real sexy college girl. Watching the two fuck turned we on so bad I started fucking with my hot readhead girlfriend
So this is how we spend time at our wild sex parties. We drink a lot, have genuine conversations on dirty topics, play stupid but fun games... Then all of a sudden we just find ourselves filming for a dr.unk orgy movie. What can be better than watching hot Russian girls fuck? Only fucking them for real, and that's exactly what we do. The most fun part I think was when surfers arrived and settled not far away from us. They could see young students fucking on the beach and we probably shocked with what was happening at our nasty party!

After watching the game, I have to say that Ferrum's offensive success has hinged on the offensive line's ability to have success. Today, the success of the offensive line was uncharacteristically absent. Not always absent, but pretty spotty in the second half.
Ferrum could not control the line of scrimmage, on either side of the ball. There were 5 quarterback sacks against Ferrum, and Bridgewater had 263 yards rushing. Just one of those games where nothing went right. Not sure what else to say. Ferrum had very little go their way. Quarterback Zach Clifford had a strong game, but left with an injury, and did not return. Backup QB Titus Jones did throw a touchdown to Nick Pearce, but there was just too much of them, and not enough of us.
Ferrum will close out the season with a trip to Danville next week against a strong Averett team. Averett is 7-2, and will be a tough opponent. Hopefully Ferrum can fix what went wrong today, and end 2018 with a win.
Today marks Senior Day for Ferrum. It's the last home game for the 14 Seniors on the roster who will finish their college eligibility at season's end. It marks the last game in front of the home fans, but not the last game......that will be next week at Averett. Today, while the last home game is special, winning the last home game is even more important.
Bridgewater comes into Ferrum with a very capable team, and seemingly very similar. Both teams are 3-3 in the conference. and the Eagles have defeated two teams that Ferrum lost to.....Guilford, (30-28) and Emory and Henry (53-13). They are averaging 207 ypg rushing, and 171 ypg passing. Defensively, they are giving up 145 yards per game on the ground, and 221 ypg through the air.
Look for Ferrum to do much the same as they have all year. Watch for Johnny White to have a career day, and expect Nick Pearce to share the spotlight. Brian Mann will have the bulls eye on his back, and while the Eagles may have some success early slowing Mann, the shifty running back from Giles H.S. will break some big runs as the day goes on, and wear the defense down. He will likely eclipse 200 yards again today.
On defense, Ferrum may give up a few points early, but look for adjustments to be made, and Ferrum, in the end should prevail. Keep in mind, this is a good team they lost to Randolph-Macon in 2 overtimes. A win today closes out conference play on the right note and would give Ferrum a winning conference record in it's first year in the ODAC.
I think this could be a close game in the first half, but look for Ferrum to salt away the Eagles as time move on.
Just before the Shenandoah game, I received a comment on the blog from an anonymous reader telling me that Ferrum would win only two games. The reader also said that those two wins would come against The Apprentice School, and Greensboro. The comment went on to say that Ferrum's football program was not up to the test of the competitive ODAC. Essentially, the message of the comment was that Ferrum would not be competitive and did not belong in the ODAC.
Today, Ferrum traveled to Randolph Macon. The conference leader. A very good team that only had one loss, against national power Johns Hopkins. They had systematically defeated seven opponents in a row. The Yellow Jackets could wrap up the conference with a win.....at home......on Senior Day. It was a storybook setup for Randolph Macon, and if you were to give the aforementioned anonymous comment poster any credence at all, Ferrum might as well just stay on the bus, and watch the trophy presentation through the bus windows. Well if you don't think Ferrum belongs, THINK AGAIN!
With a solid offensive performance, and a defense that just befuddled the Randolph Macon boys, Ferrum had it's best game of the year, and it's biggest win in I don't know how long. Final- Ferrum 28 Randolph Macon 23 This was huge. Ferrum may not win the conference, but there will not be one single team next year, looking forward to playing them. So Ferrum may not win the ODAC this year, but they are heading in that direction, and I don't think it will be long.
Ferrum, the boys from the sticks. The team that plays at the base of Saul's Knob. The team that according to some just is not on the same level as those older more refined schools of the ODAC, sent the Yellow Jackets back to their locker room with the second L of the year on their record.......Oh and did you know.......this was the fifth all time meeting between Randolph Macon and Ferrum. Ferrum leads the series.....5-0.
Coming off a big win over Hampden-Sydney, Ferrum travels to Ashland Virginia to take on the conference leader, Randolph Macon. The Yellow Jackets sit atop the ODAC and have the playoffs in their sights. Ferrum is out of the playoff picture, but has a huge chance to make a statement in this game. Make no mistake, this is not going to be an easy game for Ferrum. With their only loss coming in week one against national power Johns Hopkins, Randolph Macon is rolling through the opposition since then. They are averaging 40 points per game, and only giving up 25. They have a balanced attack, and opponents are only gaining 150 yards on the ground. Look for this to be a hard fought contest, and with the won loss records of both teams, and the fact that the game is in Ashland, it would be really easy to write this game off as a Yellow Jacket win.........but, I have a feeling the Panthers will have a lot to say about this. It's time for the upset. Look for Ferrum to have a happy bus ride home.
On a trip back to Ferrum, I was fortunate to see many friends, the Blueridge Folklife Festival, and one heck of a football game. Since returning home Sunday, I have worked both jobs every day, and have to be at work in just over an hour while writing this at 4:52 a.m., so this will be somewhat abbreviated.
Both teams, came into the game at 3-3. Hampden-Sydney was known for a strong passing attack, and Ferrum has a run heavy offense. The question was whose defense would prevail. In a comparison of game stats, Hampden-Sydney seemed to outshine the Panthers in almost every statistical category.....
Ferrum offensively out gained the Tigers on the ground 260 yards to 87. Ferrum and the Tigers each suffered one intercepted pass, but Hampden-Sydney fumbled three times, and lost all three. Ferrum did not fumble. Time of possession went to the Tigers.
It turned out to be the solid performances of Brian Mann, Zach Cliford, and the Ferrum defense that led the Panthers to their fourth win of the season. This was a big win for Ferrum, and definitely gave the Panthers momentum, heading into this week. They will need it as they hit the road for Ashland Virginia to take on the 7-1, and conference leading Randolph Macon Yellow Jackets.
For the first time, the Tigers of Hampden-Sydney will travel to Ferrum to take on the Panthers. This is not the first meeting of the programs, but it has been a difficult thing to get the two teams to meet at W.B. Adams Stadium. The series began in 2011 at the Tigers Everett Stadium, with Hampden-Sydney winning 38-14. They next met in 2015 at Dillon Stadium at Franklin County High School, with the Tigers again winning 55-24. This location was used as the new field turf installation was going on at Ferrum. The most recent meeting was at Salem Stadium in 2016. Ferrum broke into the win column in that game with a 42-20 decision.
Today is not only the Tigers first visit to Ferrum, but it's Folklife Festival Saturday which will mean a campus full of folks. Look for Ferrum to have their hands full, especially where pass defense is concerned. Quarterback Alec Cobb and receiver Major Morgan are the main part of a passing threat that is averaging over 400 yards per game. Ferrum will counter offensively with Zach Clifford and Nick Pearce. They lead a passing attack averaging 188 yards per game. The main offensive threat for Ferrum will again be Brian Mann. Look for him to have a strong day, but he will be again going against a stingy defense. This game will have many of the same markings as last weeks Washington and Lee game. Two good teams, slugging it out. Do not be surprised that the winner will be the team who has the ball last. I believe this time it will be Ferrum.
In a game that I expected to be a war, the game did not disappoint. The outcome was on the other hand disappointing. Mainly because Ferrum needed that win. Don't get me wrong, these were two really strong teams. There were more things that needed to be in Ferrum's favor than the two controversial calls. This was a tale of two different offenses. Ferrum scored mostly on big plays, while W&L had more of a grind it out attack. The time of possession battle was not even close as the Generals maintained possession about 17 minuets longer than Ferrum. This kept the Panther defense on the field too long. This played a big role in Ferrum giving up over 400 rushing yards. The trench warfare was won by the Generals.
No originally ineligible receiver shall be or have been more than three yards beyond the neutral zone until a passer throws a legal forward pass that crosses the neutral zone. A player is in violation of this rule if any part of his body is beyond the three-yard limit.
Ferrum was penalized for ineligible man down field while attempting a two point conversion. I can only go by what I could see from the camera angle available to me. It looked to me that one player was beyond the three yard mark, but he was an eligible receiver (#86) Adam Vaught. Vaught was, as I saw it lined up as an end. The pass never crossed the neutral zone, so in my opinion, the call should not have happened.
Ferrum returns home today to entertain returning alumni, and host Washington and Lee. The Generals come into the game with a 4-1 record, most recently having defeated Emory and Henry 40-29. They come in averaging 28 points per game, and only giving up just over 19 points per game. Their offense seems to be based mainly around the run, utilizing the read option, like Ferrum. They have a stout offensive line, and this seems to be the unit making the running game possible. Through 5 games, they have only thrown 34 passes. By comparison, Ferrum has thrown 123 passes in the same amount of games.
Look for the Generals to utilize No.1 Josh Breece as their main running back. He is averaging 125 yards per game and has 4 touchdowns. On the defensive side of the ball, Washington and Lee is giving up 333 yards per game....Opponents are averaging 137 yards on the ground, and 196 through the air.
I look for this game to be a war. Ferrum I think has the advantage in that the running game and passing games are so balanced. The Panthers are averaging 289 yards on the ground per game, and 190 through the air. Both offenses can strike quickly. Look for Brian Mann to have a strong game, but I think the Panthers will share the offensive wealth. Look for Johnny White, Nick Pearce, and Chris Baker to all play pivotal roles as well as Zach Clifford on the occasional keeper.
Ferrum will need to be strong in the trenches, and if they can win the trench warfare, they can win the game.
This was a very good game, between two really talented teams. It had the markings, based on what I could tell from statistics, of possibly a high scoring contest. It seemed that the Quakers defense was going to be suspect, but it was not. Both teams featured a strong running game, but in the end, this was a game Ferrum should have won.
Ferrum did many things right, and played a really good game, but in this case, there were too many missed opportunities, Four times, Ferrum could have put points on the board, and came away without any. This in the end was a huge contributor to the defeat.
One big stat that jumps out at me is that Zach Clifford was sacked 5 times! The Quakers QB was not sacked. The pass rush has to improve. Yes there were opportunities, but its time to focus on Washington and Lee. This will be a huge game Can Ferrum still contend for the conference? Yes, but two things have to happen. Ferrum must win out.....no more losses, and someone, in addition to Ferrum has to beat Randolph Macon. That will give them a chance. Even then, it still may not be enough. In addition to that, Emory and Henry and Guilford both have to lose one more game.
The climb to a conference championship just got tougher......much tougher......and there are no easy games left on the docket.
Due to hurricane Michael, the football game vs. Guilford has been moved to Friday, October 12th at 7p.m.
Other than playing Guilford in a scrimmage the last couple of seasons, I really did not know much about them. Until recently, Guilford was not what I would have considered an upper echelon team of the ODAC. Their records over the last few years are as follows:
2015 was the best year in their recent football history, going 9-1. Its easy to see that their program has really improved, but this year, their offensive production has been unbelievable. Through 4 games, the Quakers are averaging 46 points per game. In two games they scored 61 points, and in their other two games they scored 28 and 34. They are currently 1-3. A fifth game was played vs. Huntingdon but was stopped due to weather. The weather did not clear, and eventually, the game was ruled a no contest. No statistics counted, but at the time the game was stopped, the Quakers had put up 48 points. While this is very impressive, it's important to know that all of this scoring is tarnished by a defense that is giving up 54.8 ppg. This includes a 91-61 loss to FCS opponent Davidson.
There is no question that the Davidson game skews the numbers to a point, but I think there are still valid conclusions that can be drawn from the Quakers early season games. Overall, it looks to me that their defense is not all that impressive, but they can put up points. They are averaging 553 offensive yards per game. 293 ypg on the ground, and 260 ypg through the air.
The Guilford passing offense is is currently ranked 58th nationally. Ferrum is ranked 143rd. Stats for rushing offense show the Quakers ranked 10th in the nation with Ferrum ranked 11th.
The national rankings for passing defense show Guilford tied for 181st, while Ferrum's pass defense is ranked 87th. Finally Guilford's rushing defense is ranked......well it's hard to say where they are ranked. Currently, Guilford's rushing defense stats are not listed on the NCAA website. Going by the Guilford athletics page however, the Quakers, as I listed earlier, are giving up 336 rushing yards per game. That places them 248th at best in the nation in rushing defense. (Out of 250 teams)
So now that your head is spinning with numbers, what does all that mean? To me, it means, Ferrum will run the ball a lot Thursday. This will help them control time of possession, thus keeping the Guilford offense off of the field. In the end, this game could go either way, but I am thinking the advantage goes to Ferrum as their rushing offense will be superior, and the defense will slow significantly a high powered offense.
I want to try to write an article about Brian Mann, and his college career at Ferrum, but my biggest fear is that I will leave something out. In almost 2 1/2 seasons, to say that Mann had made his mark in the Ferrum record books is a gigantic understatement. This guy has done nothing but methodically grind his way to being the college's all time leading rusher. Let's look at some numbers over the those 2 1/2 years.
What is left for Brian to accomplish? After the Shenandoah game, not only had Brian eclipsed the all time rushing leader record formerly held by Freddie Stoval, he also that day set the most yards rushing in a game (260).....breaking his own record of 258, he set the career touchdown mark of 36 touchdowns since arriving at Ferrum, and he set the all purpose yards mark now, 4716 yards.
While this has been a heck of a ride for Mann, there are likely still things to shoot for. Personally I would like to see a kickoff returned for a touchdown. That has not happened in quite a while. Also, the most touchdowns in a game is attainable, but it would take 7 to break that record. By the way, currently Mann is the second leading rusher in the nation in division III football.
In the end, records are nice, but it's the wins that matter most. I am sure Brian is mainly interested in getting the team victories. I don't get the impression that Mann is particularly stressing over his personal accomplishments, but rather I would guess he is focused on an ODAC championship.
No matter how things turn out this season, it's truly enjoyable watching this young man play. He is a rarity, and it will likely be years before another player of his caliber comes along. It's a great time to be a Ferrum fan, and Brian has one more year left wearing No. 5.
The last time Ferrum held an opponent scoreless was September 22nd 2018 as the Panthers defeated Greensboro College 81-0, at Ferrum. Before that, it was on October 1st, 2016 when they blanked the Pride of Greensboro College, 30-0. The game was played in Greensboro, N.C.
The last time the Panthers were shutout was September 9, 2000 when the Panthers fell to the Emory and Henry Wasps 10-0 at Ferrum.
The first football victory for Ferrum came in its second game of the 1955 inaugural season. The visiting VMI freshmen team, lead by quarterback Bobby Ross, were defeated by the Panthers 18-13.
The longest punt by a Panther punter is 72 yards. This was set September 17th 2016 by Tyler Morgan against Hampden-Sydney.
Ferrum has never been ranked in D3 football.com's Top 25. It was ranked 26th in 2005, but has never cracked the top 25 in this poll.
Ferrum has NEVER gone winless in a season. They were held to only one win in 1956, 57, 59, 96 and 2014 but have never gone without a win.
Ferrum's largest margin of victory was on September 22nd 2018, when they defeated Greensboro College 81-0. Before this, Baltimore Community College 83-3 in 1974.
There are only 2 football jersey numbers retired at Ferrum. #22 which belonged to Chris Warren, and # 56 which belonged to David Harper.

The Master Carvers Association was founded in 1897 as an employers association, by a number of companies who employed carvers, to enable national negotiations with the emerging unions.
In 1992 the rules of the Association were changed to enable individual self-employed carvers to become members.
Then, to widen the scope of the association, in 2009 the rules were changed once again to create a third category of membership: associate member. This category is open to budding carvers and others who have a particular interest or contribution to make to professional carving.
There were previously just two categories: full and honorary. The honorary category is reserved for those members with distinguished careers who retire. Today the Association remains alone in representing professional carvers and has become the only body able to uphold the standards of the carving crafts.
All members are professional carvers with years of experience. To join one has to submit a portfolio of recent work and to have been in business for a minimum of five years. The committee reviews each application for membership.
This Portland Stone crucifix, situated in Moxely in the West Midlands, is a restoration of an original damaged statue by West Sussex based Master Craftsman Graham Heeley.
Houghtons of York recently had the pleasure of being asked to travel to Lindisfarne (Holy Island) in Northumberland to examine one of the castle doors and bring it back to their workshop for repair.
Following an early start Houghton's joiners reached site at 8:30am and made their way to the door. They were met on site by the property’s building surveyor and discussed the methods by which the door was to be repaired and together agreed the best way to proceed.
MCA member Paul Wilson was commissioned by the renowned designer Shalini Misra to design and carve elements for the Paradise Fountain - a 2.5m x 2.5m chandelier with 52 handmade barley twist crystal arms and pans with 52 specially made video candles and over 3,500 individual Swarovski crystals - which was mounted under an opulent red velvet canopy as a central feature at the prestigious 2017 Decorex Champagne Bar at Syon Park, London. Paul worked with the third generation chandelier maker Clartés Bohemia and Theo Vanderzalm.
The fountain was based on an iconic feature of The Great Exhibition of 1851 and Paul sourced 180 year old English lime for the commission. His brief was to design, carve and gild parakeets, which are now indigenous in London, together with 600mm high Prince of Wales feathers to be mounted as a central feature of the chandelier with a vegan remit. This meant moving away from some traditional methods whilst achieving the same end result using the Kölner Instacoll gilding method - ie not using animal skin glue, size or squirrel hair tips for gilding. The whole project took 380 hours to complete.
A fantastic time lapse video showing the construction of the new cathedral of St Paul, Minnesota pipe organ casework, where all of the hand carving was done by member company Agrell Architectural Carving can be see below.
The casework was constructed and installed by Geoff's Woodworking. For further information and photographs of this project please visit Geoff's Woodworking website at www.geoffswoodworking.com

Graham Heeley Studios is a workshop based in Cranleigh, Surrey, making commissioned sculpture-based work through carving and modelling. Having recently carved and fitted two limestone plaques of hunting subjects, such as the trout for a large house in the Scottish Highlands, Graham is presently working on a house near Farnham in Surrey, carving a selection of bawdy scenes from Chaucers The Millers Tale in relief on an exterior exposed oak beam 16ft long and 12in high. Also underway is a figure of an angel to be finished in bronze resin for a chapel of rest.
Last year Graham completed a project which required the supply of 150m2 of vaulting panels which were reproduced in resin at his workshop from a set of originals that Graham carved in oak.

Master Carver Tim Crawley was commissioned to carve and install a new marble fountain at Kenilworth Castle as part of a larger project by English Heritage to recreate an Elizabethan garden. The castle was given by the Queen to her favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in 1563. In 1575 he entertained her there with a party so extravagant that it nearly bankrupted him. It is possible the young Shakespeare was present, later incorporating certain events in A Midsummer Nights Dream.
The 19 day celebration, and the garden with the fountain at its centre, was described in a letter by Robert Langham. This document was the main source for the restoration, intended to enhance the experience of visitors to the site.

Picking it up saturday. Unfortunately car prices have dropped so bad I'm losing loads on the coupe and only had it a year, but it works both ways as you can pick 350z's up well cheap now.
Insurance is barely more than the coupe for some reason and you can pick one up for as much as an SIII.
they are nice.but finished well behind the coupe in auto express.but i been looking at em for a bit now
sorry mate the renault engine is not a myth as you can find the same engine in the vel satis, laguna coupe and the espace i checked before i posted
It's a myth. I can post you a million links if that helps you. but Im sure you can find them yourself.
i know its the other way round renaults have different versions of the nissan engine just like to wind up nissan owners even though i'd have one if i could afford one
I just recently received a 30Gig Ipod for Christmas and eagerly loaded Itunes on my Windows Media Center pc. When installed it searched for and found my Media Center library and began converting into Itunes (which was pretty cool).
Problem is I only have about 900 songs and the 30 Gigs are full. Both of my kids have 30 Gig Ipods that hold many more songs.
I checked the settings and I am using the default AAC settings. Does anyone have a clue why my songs are taking so much space (as compared to my kids)?
Well first you can have a look at the actual song files to see if they really take up those 30 gigs. At 128kbps (which is the default AAC setting, I believe) you should be getting roughly one MB/min. So a 4 minute song should be about 4 MB or slightly under.
Some things that can increase the filesize are if they are encoded at a higher bitrate (better sound quality, but bigger files, and can you really tell the difference with the Apple earbuds?) or an uncompressed format, or have embedded artwork.
You can see the total size of all your song files very easily from within iTunes. Along the bottom edge is a status bar which tells you the song count, runtime, and filesize, of whatever list or view is selected. Mine says "1953 songs, 6.1 days, 8.32 GB". When I click on it, the "6.1 days" changes to "6:04:19:24 total time". I share a computer, and an iTunes, with another user, so I'm looking at "My Playlist" rather than "Music", but you'll want to look at all 900 of your songs. It should equal roughly four GB in all. If it's showing more than that, then you've got some files that are probably encoded at a higher bitrate. Embedded images will also increase the filesize by the size of the actual image file. The image is embedded in each file, even if a dozen songs on the same album all have the same artwork, they each have to have a copy. So hi-resolution images can bloat the files also. Note: this is only for embedded images. Cover art that is downloaded, with iTunes, gets saved in its own database and is optimized for the iPod before it gets transfered. This won't increase the size of your song files at all and will take up a minimal amount of space on the iPod.
Are all of your tracks ripped using the default AAC settings, or is it possible you have some that were in another format? You can view the filetype in iTunes by right-clicking on the bar along the top that says "name, artist, track number, album" etc. This will show a list of all available columns. If there isn't a checkmark next to "Kind", then click it so that it shows. If there is already a check, then find the "Kind" column and click it to sort by filetype. Click it again to reverse the sort order. Uncompressed formats such as AIFF, WAV, or Apple Lossless, will take up about ten times as much space as compressed formats such as MP3 or AAC, which is about what you're seeing, right?
If the files themselves aren't actually taking up all 30 GB, then you may have a bunch of photos, or maybe it's files that were stored on the iPod in disk mode. Set the iPod for disk mode ("Enable disk use" from the iPod Summary tab in iTunes while the iPod is connected), and then go find it in Windows Explorer. See if there are a bunch of files (or a few very large ones ) in there. Or if there's no photos or files, then maybe it's just garbage data. See if a restore doesn't fix it. Restoring erases all data on your iPod, so make sure you have a backup somewhere, or at least still have the files in iTunes (shouldn't be a problem if you autosync, but some people who use manual mode like to load files on the iPod and then remove them from the computer).
I just realized (duhr!)...iTunes will tell you what's on your iPod. There's the bar at the bottom of the iPod window that says (for example): Audio-3.62GB, Photos-338.9KB, Other-23.7MB, Free Space-89.7MB. What does it claim is taking up the bulk of your 30GB? If it's all 30 GB of "Other" then it's probably files on the disk, or just garbage data. Or perhaps you got a faulty unit, in which case you should still be under warranty if you just got it this Christmas.
Introduction The Squad Team reserves the right to edit, update, add and remove rules at any time. Applicable rules extend to the PM system. Your PMs are private, but the Squad Team may be informed about unacceptable PM content by the receiving party. Section I: Posting Rules §1 Show Respect This community can only work if we all respect each other. To that end, it is imperative that any time you engage with another user, either directly or indirectly, you show them respect with the content of your post. In particular refrain from flaming, insulting, abusing, taunting, racism, and other similar types of actions towards other forum users. §2 Attitude & Behavior Poor attitude and behavior are the most common ways a negative / unsafe environment is created and perpetuated. As such that kind of behavior will not be allowed on these forums. Please be mindful of this rule when posting personal positions and opinions regarding topics which could be considered contentious in nature. As a rule of thumb, keep your posts civil in nature, and refrain from making posts that are likely to incite arguments and create a negative environment. As a privately hosted web forum we reserve the right to maintain an environment that we are happy the majority of our players are comfortable with. §3 Swearing While we will not strictly moderate every little swear that occurs, please try to avoid excessive bad language. The moderation reserves the right to remove rants and unsuitable content at any time. §4 Illegal Topics
Prohibited topics include, but are not limited to: Piracy, drugs (including cannabis), pornography, religion, racism, sexism, homo/trans -phobic content, videos and images showing violent death or serious injury, ‘spam threads’, hacking & griefing (endorsement thereof), religion, politics, etc. Prohibition may be suspended for some threads if they are found to be suitable by the Moderation (such as scientific debate).
If there is doubt, the Moderation Team can decide whether a topic is considered illegal. §5 Attitude towards Squad and the Development Team
As per §1 and §2, keep in mind to be respectful and reasonable, not only towards all users of the forum, but also towards the Squad Team and towards any ideas and content and the game itself. Criticism is welcome, but if it is not constructive and/or if it is offensive, the Moderation may need to step in. Please refrain from posting if you are upset, angry or drunk, or you may be punished for things you wouldn’t have otherwise written, which is not in anyone's interest. §6 Language & Legibility
Please post only in English. Non-English content (including non-legible content) may be removed. If you see someone posting in another language because s/he apparently does not speak English, please report their post - if you can, you may reply in their language to explain their question, but please do translate their and your message so it can be reviewed by the Moderation. ‘Hiding’ insults in non-English posts will be punished harshly. Posts written largely in ‘leetspeak’ or full of spelling / grammatical errors may be treated like non-English content. This rule does not extend to PMs. §7 Forum structure & Search
Please ensure when posting a new thread, that the thread is located inside the correct forum section. Check all forum section titles to judge where your thread should belong. Threads created in the wrong forum section will be moved or deleted.
Before posting a new thread, please make use of the forum search to find older threads about the same topic. In doubt, it is recommended to rather post in an existing thread, unless that thread is years out of date. However, do not bump old threads without adding a new question / answer / insight that wasn’t in that thread before - use common sense. §8 Thread Titles
Please name your thread appropriately; the subject title should sum up / explain the content in the thread. If you fail to name your thread properly (such as ‘Hey!’ or ‘Check this out!’ or ‘Help!’), we will either rename or lock the topic. Repeated offense may lead to infractions. The practice of using CAPITALS only in your thread title is not allowed and will be edited or the thread will simply be deleted. Strange or abnormal Unicode characters should be excluded from thread titles for the sake of being distracting and unnecessary.
Please ensure that your post is not in all CAPITALS, as this is not allowed. Any threads posted in all caps will subsequently be removed from the forum. Repeated offenses may lead to infractions against your account. This practice is not approved or accepted here.
Do not include more than ~1 large image per paragraph of text, unless in image collection / announcement threads. Link to further images.
Consider posting thumbnails. You may post a few more images per post if they are reasonably small, the details are for the Moderation to judge. §11 The use of BBCode
It is allowed to use the BBCode in your posts. Over usage is not allowed. You may use the Bold in a reasonable manner but not for the whole text body. You may use the size feature but in a limited reasonable manner. You may not use any of the additional fonts at all. Color may be used to high light a point but again, not for the whole text body. Moderators will be watching for misuse and will edit when required without giving notice. Continued disregard for this rule will result in Moderator action in the form of warnings. §12 Complaints of Server/Admin Abuse Reports of server/admin abuse will not be posted publicly. All reports concerning this type of behavior should be place in the appropriate sub-forum. http://forums.joinsquad.com/forum/241-report-server-admin-abuse/ All posts made outside of this area will be be removed. Section II: Reporting & Moderation §1 Reporting Posts
There is a Post Report system in place. If you notice a post that violates forum rules, simply use the exclamation mark icon below the users avatar image to send a report to the Moderation. We will then review this post. Your report will not be made public and cannot be linked to your person by anyone outside of the Squad Team. You will not be punished for using the Report system even if the report was false, unless you repeatedly abuse the system to spam it.
Do not ‘report’ posts by replying directly in public to them. In case of spambots, this prompts them to respond in turn, spamming the forum further. This also fuels flame wars and arguments. §2 Reporting Moderators
Moderators are subject to the same forum rules (and some additional rules / exceptions). If you think that a Moderator has treated you unfairly or is otherwise breaking forum rules, please PM the Lead Moderator or any Administrator. Do not accuse Moderators in public, the Squad Team will treat every complaint seriously and it is in our interest to discipline or remove Moderators who are known to break forum rules. §3 Respect Squad Team members and Moderators
Do not ignore or argue against Admin, Moderator or Dev instructions on the forum. If you have a complaint, as per §2, please inform the Team in private. You are expected to follow orders given by the Moderation, Administration and Development Team, and it is necessary for smooth running of the forum to respect their decisions. Being stubborn or ignoring warnings will lead to harsher punishments - however, we do not tolerate Moderator / Admin abuse of power / privileges, so do not hesitate to inform other Team members if you feel treated unfairly. §4 Bans and multiple accounts
If your account is temporarily or permanently banned, do NOT create another account. Bypassing a ban will result in further action, and a permanent ban of all of your accounts.
You are not allowed to have more than one account for any reason.

Compared it to my DVD from 2003; not a great difference. Ever so sightly more bass and the drums sound a little fuller. (probably equalized during mastering)
From the YouTube promoting the recent THOR movie, I thought the sound I heard with IS was fantastic... maybe the best sounding version of the studio version. I'd like all Zeppelin tracks to sound that good. The song really kicks in at about :37
Quick...when was the last time you listened to HTWWW? How many of you listen to "Burn That Candle" (or whatever your title of choice for 6.25.72) more often than HTWWW?
I understand why Jimmy wants to release HTWWW again to get the catalogue uniformly in order. But if there is a show that is begging for a vinyl release it is the 1970 Royal Albert Hall. It would sound sensational on vinyl! I have to think this will be one of the 50th anniversary releases after September comes.

Indeed. The sound is amazing, especially the drums. And Plant is so incredible - what a range! Great set list and a stellar performance. The rock and roll covers are icing on the cake.
Exactly. RAH ‘70 most likely will be one of the 50th celebration releases at some point. It was also JP’s birthday, so why not?
It is hard to tell by listening to a YouTube clip. It seems a bit better, but the real test will be when I can compare the actual discs side by side.
I totally agree! But fear most of those covers are going to be left on the cutting room floor. I seem to remember a pretty nice bootleg box set being available from this show. Four LP's and I think it came with a DVD too. If you want the entire gig on vinyl, that's where I'd start.
Based on the fidelity of that YouTube post I can't see any good reason to buy this release. The novelty of owning it on vinyl isn't enough , it would have to be sonically superior to the digital versions and I doubt they did a dedicated mastering for vinyl. It's most likely a CD sound on vinyl. Is the artwork anything special? This release seems like such a waste.
The artwork is very simple, too simple. Each disc sleeve just has a variety of filters of the front cover image and song titles on the rear. There is a two 12" page insert; again same image on the front, a two page spread of a group shot and four smaller individual shots, all in black and white, and song info on the rear.
im not too fussed about having booklets included, I read them once and that's it. Nor stickers and gimmicks,. But if there is to be something included at least put some effort into it.
I've noticed tons of used HTWWW floooding the used cd section lately. It seems to me that if you never got HTWWW now is a good time to pick up a set for $8 or $9 as this is the only edition that will still have "Hello Mary Lou" and whatever else Jimmy edited out in the new remaster.
No matter how good the new remaster sounds, the bootleg is still going to be my first choice whenever I am in the mood to listen to June 25, 1972. So I will probably wait until a nice used copy appears in the shops before getting the super deluxe box. I'll get the cd version to play at work or on my commutes from time to time, but there's no hurry. My original HTWWW or "Burn That Candle" or "California Beach Party" will suffice just fine.
I'm more focused on what's coming out later in the year for the 50th anniversary. That's what I'm saving my March Madness winnings for.
It seems like forever since music release dates changed (from Monday here in the UK). I still haven't decided whether we are now getting new stuff three days earlier or four days later.
I have just the Bluray audio coming for now...but at the moment Amazon says I won't get it until Wednesday, and yes I have Prime. If I were to order the super deluxe today, it would arrive Tuesday.
Misery loves company, eh? *Perhaps* once it's actually shipped it will update to arriving on release date...but not really planning on it. .
No matter how good the new remaster sounds, the bootleg is still going to be my first choice whenever I am in the mood to listen to June 25, 1972
"How The West Was Redone Again" is the way to go IMO. Like you, I'll just wait a couple years and pick the remaster up on eBay. And I'd rather spend the money on the official photo book anyway.
for anyone thinking of getting the vinyl set straight away, I'd suggest waiting a month or two to see if the price reduces, as often happens. if id have thought to check the price before I ordered it at my local vinyl shop, I'd have done the same. I haven't done a contrast against the original cd as I stored all my cds away. its nice to have it on vinyl but having paid 380 for it I wish id waited now
Lowest I've seen it is here for 116.99£ but I am going to wait, the first few batches usually have some defects too.
My old pop rivet dimple dies are shot and never worked well for my RV7. I have no idea what brand they are but they look like super cheap junk. They are all rusted up and not worth trying to save them.
That being said, I am either going to order some from ACS who claim they are old Avery stock or some from Cleveland.
Are there any cases where you really need a 1/8" pop rivet dimple tool on the RV10? To be honest I don't remember ever using the 1/8" one on the 7 and have a hard time imagining anywhere you would need one on the 10???

I've used it a lot. Great for when you forgot to dimple something before assembly, or you make a change to the design. I used it when installing the Van's kit for the landing lights because I didn't have a deep enough yoke for a squeezer to reach.

This law will affect every county in the state and some groups are gearing up to protest it, and this issue is now pending litigation in federal court. Probate offices are on the clock to prepare and sift through confusion.
"I have confusion about it," Montgomery resident Jamie Rodriguez said, though it's difficult to understand what he's saying.
He's lived and worked in Montgomery for 8 years. His broken English and changes in proof of citizenship, make getting his tag renewal a little more difficult.
And come September 1st, it's going to be even more difficult, not only for people like Jaime, but all Alabama residents.
He says even though the state passed the law in June...it didn't release rules and regulations until just 12 days ago.
"And it's been a short fuse for everybody and we're trying our best here in Montgomery county to comply and we will comply, it's just a lot of work. McKinney says all the documents will now have to be scanned and stored. New scanners are on the way and staff must be trained by the September first deadline.
He says you will have to physically bring in proof of citizenship. And that could mean suspending the Internet and mail-in renewal system which accounts for 17 percent of business, adding more chaos and larger crowds in the offices.
And it's going to be costly to implement these changes, estimates reach $30,000. For residents with transactions at the probate offices after September first, if you have a valid Alabama license, meaning it's not expired, all you will have to bring is your Alabama license for proof of citizenship. No other documents are required.
And you can save a lot of time by going in early for your renewals. Also, a website is under construction and is expected to be available next week to answer questions and provide information on the new changes. Visit www.mc-ala.org to find the link.

, week, month and year through you unchecked air conditioning and refrigeration systems? If this is not something which has ever occurred to you then chances are you have already thrown thousands of pounds of profit directly to your energy suppliers without thinking twice about why your business energy bills are so high. In fact, you are no doubt immune to the ever increasing costs related to your energy - but if someone offered you the opportunity to save anywhere up to 30% on your energy bills, would you snatch the chance up with both hands?
Around 75% of large business' energy bills are made up through the use of air conditioning and refrigeration systems, so this is most certainly the place to start looking for ways to cut back. Unfortunately
, since you no doubt need all the machines and systems, which you have tirelessly working around the clock, to continue doing their job, whether they are keeping food stock cool or the office at a legal temperature, then aside from turning all the machines off each night (which in the case of food stock is an impossibility)
The answer is through energy saving by optimisation. In other words, having a complete system 'tune up'. This is the next crucial step for your business to make to ensure that you can start saving on your energy bills today.
There are many changes currently being put in place for the coming year on the older, heavily serviced systems. For example any system which used R22 must now be completely overhauled and deep cleaned before being replaced with a new, 'cleaner' refrigerant. Along with this, more regular leak detection checks are becoming compulsory and systems whose charge is equivalent to or greater than 500 tons of carbon dioxide a year need a constant leak detection system running in order to be legal. Finally
, in 2015 manufacturers will be offering flammable refrigerants and the 17th IET Edition wing regulations will be upgraded to the 18th Edition. Changes are afoot, and all of them are created to help the businesses using air conditioning andor refrigeration systems to run more safely and economically thus allowing them to save money.
System health checks are non invasive, in other words, you don't have to shut up shop for the work to take place meaning you can be saving whilst you are earning.
Using a system such as ClimaCheck allows you to simply and easily keep on top of how your system is running which is crucial, both for covering yourself under the EU regulations of any 12 kilowatt systems being regularly performance tested
, and as a way to ensure you find and fix faults and leaks the moment they appear thus saving yourself wasted energy and money.
A consistently accurate check from the ClimaCheck system, which can be both portable or fixed, can pick up on any number of waste issues, all of which can lead to a huge, unnecessary loss of energy - or in other words
, money trickling straight from your account and in to the pockets of the energy company for no reason at all.
The optimisation systems, such as the ClimaCheck system will quickly and efficiently document and inform you of any adjustments of the expansion valve which are needed; calculate any required alterations to the water andor air flow rates, internal temperature and pressure within the system and ensure that they are correct and at their optimum setting to save you money, as well as calculate refrigerant charge and perform any necessary changes.
Putting these systems and measures in place now will ensure quick optimisation of your air conditioning and refrigeration systems and in turn start to save you anywhere up to 30% on your energy bills in a short amount of time. Imagine the potential savings when you add this up over the course of a year, five years or even the possible lifetime of your company. It is certainly tempting in terms of the potential savings
, but in many cases, the constant documentation and optimisation of your systems will also soon be a legal requirement come January 2015, so it is a win-win overhaul.
As a business owner, working hard to make money for your company only to see it pouring back out due to unnecessary energy wastage can be hugely frustrating, so put a stop to this now with energy saving by optimisation and keep your hard earned money in your own bank account! Flowers are perfect gifts for many occasions. They are able to express the feelings that we are not quite able to put into words. They are a great choice when you want to congratulate a person for a special event or an achievement. It is also a way to express love and affection for a loved one. They are perfect to present to someone going through a hard time in their lives such as a bereavement to let them know that you are thinking about them and feel their pain.
Getting the very best flowers for every occasion is a very important thing. You should actually seek expert advice to let you know exactly what you should get for a particular event. In this way the flowers that you will purchase will be able to serve the purpose sufficiently.
This is the reason why an online store is a perfect place to start. There are many of these in the present day and it is quite important that you compare the arrangements as well as the prices before settling for one specific store.
Online stores arrange the floral arrangements according to their availability and tell you about those that are not yet available. You can therefore make your purchase quite easily so as to be able to get the specific arrangement that you want.
It is also possible for you to make specific recommendations on how exactly you want the flowers to be. In this way

They require more care than artificial trees — from constant watering to disposal — but they add an undeniable festive touch.
A number of local charitable groups open tree lots every year so you can buy a tree while helping others.
Vancouver South Lions Club - the lot is run by volunteers and proceeds go back to projects supported by the Lions club including projects for kids and seniors. They're located outside John Oliver Secondary at the corner of Fraser Street and E. 41st Avenue. Credit cards are accepted.
TREK Trees - Students, their parents and teachers from Prince of Wales secondary's TREK outdoor education program rally every year to open this lot. They say they're Vancouver's largest with 2000 trees available. Prices range from $20 to $60 and they will even make free deliveries to seniors. You can find the lot at Prince of Wales 2250 Eddington Drive.
Aunt Leah's Tree Lots - If you live outside of Vancouver, then Aunt Leah's might have the tree for you. Proceeds from purchases will support the charity's work with foster kids, teen mothers and provide retail training experience for youth right at the lot. Prices start at $15 for a tree.
Scouts Christmas Tree Lot - The North Shore Scouts host an annual tree lot to raise funds supporting a number of groups in the area. You can find them at Park Royal at the corner of Taylor Way and Clyde Avenue.
Keep in mind if you plan on re-planting the trees outside after you've had it in your home, it can only remain indoors for up to two weeks.
Garden Centres - stores like Figaro's Garden in East Vancouver and Art's Nursery in Surrey have stocked up on a selection of potted trees that you can nurture year-round after the decorations come down.
Grocery stores - grocery chains across the Lower Mainland like Whole Foods and Save-on-Foods are carrying Christmas trees in pots. Some also offer pre-cut options. Prices range from $25 to $50.
If you want to head out and cut your own tree, the B.C. Christmas Tree Council has compiled a list of farms across the province you can visit with your family. Some farms let your borrow their saws and help with baling.
Farms like Langley's Frosty's Family Christmas Tree Farm and Richmond's H&M Christmas Tree Farm even serve up hot cider and carols for a fully festive outing.
When you make the decision to buy or sell a home, I'm committed to going the extra mile to ensure that all of your needs are met in a professional and honest manner. For Service and Commitment, let me help guide you with your next purchase or sale.

Hi everyone dani here this is my blog with my journey my struggles thru my ups and downs with life. mental issues and an eating disorder,
I can get behind the idea that learning how the entire world is connected is the "true" progress of the game, and it is my favourite aspect of it. I am kind of confused however, why you'd even have the password system then. I guess this is not the place, or at least it is definitely not the time, to discuss that, but it seems to me that it serves little other purpose than confusing and misguiding the player.
Well we are discussing it. Sorry if my last statement seemed like it was trying to shut down discussion. I probably shouldn't have said it that way. I've had good conversations and bad, but here it's been mostly good.
None of that really has anything to do with my core issue, though, which is the coins. I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm coming hard down on it, but it just seems like a schizophrenic implementation of a collectible system.
The un-collectability of the coins is antagonistic, for sure. They are designed to look like other coins at first, but eventually realizing that you can't keep them changes that a lot, right? That's what I meant about what I said about the passwords applying to coins as well. They do a thing that is partly familiar and partly not, and realization the latter part is a bit disturbing for most people. I was very interested in how someone recovers from that. You make a choice at that point about how to proceed (or even to stop).
Giving up on collecting all the coins is a perfectly valid choice. Giving up on collecting any at all is just as valid. Depends on what part of getting them is good for you. Similar to the way that the "final" part of the game is something some players won't find naturally, it's okay to me if they experience an "incomplete" version of Lizard. This is also why I made the ending stats give you a coin count but not a collected percent; I didn't want it to be insisting that the player is missing something. On the other end of it, some people have found all the coins, and some people think they've found them all but haven't. I wanted the best way to find out to be by comparing notes with other people.
So, it does create problems for the person who wants to collect them all. It's hard to remember what you've collected. It's hard to find them all. It takes some endurance to even get them all. There are ways to overcome it, though. If you can't remember, you can take notes. If you can't do it in one sitting, you can leave your NES on overnight. Some people have done these things. Some people have done it with no aids at all. Some people have decided not to do it. Some people have cheated to do it. Some people are waiting for a YouTube video to appear that shows them someone else doing what they want to see.
I ordered copies for a bunch of other guys over here so that we would save money on the shipping and custom fees, and whenever I hand out a copy for each of them, I've been warning them not to spend time going for the coins on their first playthrough, and it just makes me a little sad that I have to tell them that. I guess that's the gist of my issue. Everything else is really great.
That's actually wonderful to me. You've had a real reaction to the coins, and you're sharing it with others. I appreciate hearing about it.
The only "incomplete" Lizard playthroughs that are disappointing to me is that occasionally someone goes in totally blind, finds and beats one boss, and thinks this was the entire game. A few more people have done this than I expected. I can casually drop hints about the scope of the game in the form of clips in the trailer or screenshots or vague description (or just hope someone is there to tell them), but every once in a while I've seen someone do this. It was an expected consequence of how I wanted the game not to tell you where to go. Like to everyone who has asked me for an automap, to tell you where you've been, to tell you where to go-- that's the complete opposite of what I wanted this game to be.
Especially interesting when I see people discussing the game and deciding an automap doesn't exist because it'd be technically hard to do on the NES. It's not really that hard to accomplish, and I sketched and implemented various forms of one over the course of development to try it out, but I decided that it was much more valuable to not have the game tell you where to go. In many ways this also leans together with the passwords and coins and ephemeral state of the world-- if I implemented an automap it'd be a completely different game for which I would absolutely have wanted to include a battery save, and coins that save. Everything would be different. All of these choices have consequences, and many of those consequences are a net negative for some players, but I couldn't really have it both ways. :S
That's another reason I'm worried about explaining my own intentions. I think for some people it might be better for them to believe I did something a certain way because it was "too hard to do it on the NES" than for them to think that I did something with purpose, because without that crutch to lean on they might think I'm a very mean person. :S I'm not sadistic, and I don't want people to suffer, but many of the ways I intended for one kind of person to enjoy the game will be painful for someone else. If I'm honest I can't say this isn't a deliberate choice that I made, but I don't really want to go out of my way to tell someone who is having a bad time with my game "yes, I wanted this to happen." Maybe that does seem mean? If someone comes to me with a question, though, I usually want to try and answer.
Some people are waiting for a YouTube video to appear that shows them someone else doing what they want to see.
You're not going to be one of those publishers who asserts copyright against people who make such videos, are you? I seem to remember Atlus applying a progressive disclosure policy to public videos of Persona 5, allowing them to be made up through in-game early July at first and then through mid-November later on.
Like to everyone who has asked me for an automap, to tell you where you've been, to tell you where to go-- that's the complete opposite of what I wanted this game to be.
Another way to think about it: Lizard represents a landing operation. The player character couldn't bring that much tech with him into an initially unfamiliar world. But once the character establishes a beachhead, more resources will become available in sequels.
I have always encouraged streaming or making videos or sharing my game in various forms. I officially encourage anything except piracy. I actually think embargoes on streaming are a very stupid business decision in most cases.
I haven't played Persona 5 but I feel like how specific you are being about these "in game dates" is a spoiler in itself. Kinda like anything you try to say about it just draws more attention to it... ...which is not unlike the design problem I was describing with Lizard. I very much believe in the value of surprise. Trying to decide what to put in a trailer or screenshots was a bit agonizing.
Well, that would be an interesting interpretation of Lizard, but probably not compatible with the actual game's ending.
I have zero plans for a Lizard sequel, though. I don't have any idea for a meaningful continuation of it, and I don't really like sequels anyway. I want to make something else. I have 3 other NES game ideas i'm excited about, and they're each in a different genre.
I'm not really sure what to make out of your thoughts on the coin collection, and the intricacies of it. I can totally see why it's amazing from the point of view of a game designer, as people take on the quest of discovering some of the true secrets of the game, and the way it affects the community, much in the same way many NES games came out in a time when people couldn't just look up stuff on the internet, and even magazines had a ton of misleading information.
one of my favourites was following the entire flow of the lava as a stone lizard, from the top of the volcano - I know you don't have to o all the way to get the coin in the bottom, but I loved that it's possible
However, the way it's set up, the only way I see a 100% coin collection being realistic for me is exactly through community effort, which isn't particularly satisfying for me personally as it would essentially be what you hinted at - wait for a YouTube video showing me all the coins, and just follow that. Alternatively I could dump the game and play it in an emulator (which I guess is what the majority of the people who bought the game are doing anyway, or via the Steam version which as I can tell actually does save your progress!
Hell, as a mildly experienced NES developer I'm sure it wouldn't take me more than a few minutes to whip up a LUA script that lets me set the Lizards position with my mouse cursor to quickly scour the entire game for secrets (which I have a theory would turn up a few interesting things, as I have an impression that you really dig that stuff). But I was hoping for a more low tier personal experience of playing the game on an NES via the classic rules and just find a coin one at a time having fun with that. I really enjoy taking notes of coins that I need to get later, and areas where I theorize there is something to be find - but of course that won't work if I can't save my progress. Of course, as you're making clear, that's just not how you designed your game, and I'm not going to tell you how to make your game... but I really feel the game misses out on a potential here, that's ripe for the taking. Even just a smaller goal of something rewarding from finding just a few coins. I'm sure it could be done without compromising the sense of mystery.
Well we are discussing it. Sorry if my last statement seemed like it was trying to shut down discussion.
Sorry, I was the one trying to make that argument - I really didin't feel like discussing wether the game should have a password system with the things I said in mind, because the game is finished, and you have made your own weighed descision. I just wanted to share my thoughts on it.
Yes, I really do understand the gulf between the ease and appeal of collecting individual coins, and the methodical difficulty of collecting all of them. You're not alone in feeling this gap of effort is too wide, and I am sorry that this is a disappointment. It isn't really something I'd want to go back and change, I'm happy with the way this is, but I do have some sympathy for the player that wishes it wasn't quite this way. I never considered it to be a task for every player to complete, but maybe it was a little more cruel than intended by making the task so obvious as it is.
As for whether it could be a community effort, I consider that an important avenue for it, but only one of many. I've talked to many players who have found all the coins (and some did do it on an NES), and many others who decided it wasn't worth trying. People have managed it on their own, but I do also hope that community stuff can provide a way to close that gap for people that want it to be a little easier to accomplish. Also, I know a lot of people don't like the idea of using cheats, but I wanted that to be a viable option too. Was especially important to me that it have built-in cheating, so that external hardware like a game genie (or emulator) would not be necessary. Of course, hacking is a fine approach too. ...but I consider any way you want to play it valid. It's your game to play.
You don't have to dump it yourself (unless you'd enjoy doing that); I do provide download/steam keys for any cartridge purchases on request (normally through the official lizard at lizardnes.com e-mail).
The PC version's resume feature makes it an imperfect port, but it seemed a necessary compromise to keep it viable vs. using an emulator, and/or providing something like a suspend/resume functionality like most modern gaming devices have. (There's also an option to turn this feature off, too.)
A free demo version of the game is now available on the itch.io page. (This replaces the old alpha prototype demo with something that's a lot closer to the finished game.)
Is the famicom version still coming? INL still shows April/May 2018. I was holding out for a famicom cart, but I might give in and buy the NES cart if it's not coming anytime soon.
As far as I know, Famicom carts are a thing that's in motion, but there's probably been some unexpected delays for INL on that. So... I'd expect it to become available within the next few months, but I couldn't say when.
(Sort of related: a Japanese translation may eventually become available as well. Someone has offered to work on that.)
Oh, I may be interested in the famicom one since it is very uncommon to be in that format (and I don't have my original nes any more, sold all my stuff from Canada before moving). But first I need to understand more about the game. I tried the demo without reading much about it (I wanted to be surprised, hate to know too much about a new game) but I had no idea what was my goal so I gave up until I have some time to figure it out ^^;;
In an update to Loopy's question, Famicom carts will be available probably in a few weeks. I'm still waiting for a translation to be completed.

Radon is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, and radioactive gas produced from the natural decay of uranium which is found in nearly all soils. It typically moves up through the ground and into homes through cracks in the foundation, gaps and joints in the building materials, and exposures to the soil. The major health risk associated with exposure to radon gas is an increased risk of lung cancer. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, radon is the nation's second leading cause of lung cancer; only smoking causes more deaths each year. Nearly 1 out of 15 U.S. homes have an elevated radon level (four picocuries per liter of air (4 pCi/L) or more which is equivalent to 200 chest x-rays per year). Of the new houses built each year in the U.S., roughly 60,000 are likely to have radon concentrations greater than 4 pCi/L. In Wisconsin, the results of a random survey showed that 26% of the new houses constructed will have radon levels greater than 4 pCi/L. the severity of the problem has created an $8 billion U.S. radon mitigation market and the demand for more dynamic radon reduction techniques.
With grants from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services, University of Wisconsin System and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee totaling more than $900K, the Radon Reduction Technology Laboratory is investigating the phenomena of radon transport and entry dynamics with respect to innovative radon mitigation techniques. Current projects include:
Field testing and remote PC-based monitoring and control of a heat recovery ventilation-basement pressurization system at a Colgate, Wisconsin home.
Evaluation of reducing radon gas entry in residential new construction by the utilization of industrial by-products as an admixture in concrete samples.
Assessing the effectiveness of cementitious coatings and sealants with regards to obstructing the eggression of radon gas in concrete specimens.

It takes a special kind of woman to find her passion in scaling walls and paddling through muck, and we’re beyond impressed by the powerful women of OCR who are redefining what it means to act like a lady.
To put it mildly, obstacle course racing is not what your grandmother would call “ladylike.” Similar to — and often inspired by — army boot camp training, OCR tests its competitors in strength, speed, endurance, dexterity — plus sheer, unadulterated persistence. Folks who compete in obstacle racing prepare themselves to conquer extreme challenges like maneuvering around barbed wire, climbing up greased poles, jumping over fire, and crawling through near-freezing mud pits.
Fortunately, we’re starting to meet more and more of these powerful women. “There are still more guys on the course,” Jamie Stiles says. “But, there are a lot of tough girls out there — and as OCR gets bigger, there are going to be more and more of us coming out of the woodwork.”
Jamie, whose killer tattoos make her stand out on both the obstacle course and in life, has always loved being active. A former personal trainer, she took to the world of obstacle course racing like a frog takes to the mud. “I was instantly hooked — it was the most fun thing I’d ever done,” she says. “Right after my first race, I said to myself, ‘I have to do more of these.’” Now she’s competed in (and placed at) everything from Spartan Race to BattleFrog to Tough Mudder — and she’s just getting started.
Do you think that folks who are having trouble getting off the couch can be inspired by elite obstacle racers?
One thing that’s great about these races is that really, anybody can do them — I’ve seen people of all different shapes, sizes, and ages out there having a blast. It’s not just for the elite obstacle racer — it’s for everybody.
I hope I can be part of somebody’s inspiration — that would make me feel pretty happy about doing this. Everyone has something that they need to overcome, and these races help a lot. My fiancé has had a fear of heights for as long as I’ve known him, and he started doing races as well. Because of some of the obstacles that you have to climb over or jump off of, he’s really overcome his fear of heights — it’s amazing.
A lot of people don’t realize that what you’re wearing can really affect how you perform. For me, I always think that wearing less is more because there’s less material weighing you down — but it also depends on the material, too. If you travel to someplace where it’s snowing, obviously you don’t want to be wearing shorts, but here in Florida, a good bet are quick-drying compression shorts, a sports bra, compression socks, and shoes with significant traction — I like Reebok all-terrain supers, which have drainage holes, so if you’re going through water, then it’s going to drain out and not weigh your shoes down.
I’ve seen amputees out there absolutely crushing obstacles that I might struggle with. People who are blind go out, and they have people helping them get across these obstacles — seeing how it brings people together, and how everyone helps each other, I think that’s just the coolest thing.
Which OCR obstacles have been the toughest for you, what has helped you prepare for them, and what was the experience of beating them like?
Obstacles that require a lot of grip strength are tough — that’s not something most people think about having to train for, but your grip is really important for getting through some of these. So, I’ve been training to develop a stronger grip, but I love climbing, so it’s a fun challenge, too. Rock climbing helps a lot because it doesn’t just work one part of your hand — your fingers need to be strong for things like this. Pull-ups help a lot, and monkey bars. When you start really getting into OCR, you start to look around at everything outside and think, “I wonder if I can climb that.”
I cut off the outside of one of my fingers at a race last year. But, honestly, my strongest reaction was, “Man, now I have to wait a little longer before I can get back out there.” I could have lost my whole finger and would still want to do these. I’m not going to let anything stop me.
You meet so many awesome people with different backgrounds doing this, and we all have one thing in common: a passion for these different races. There are so many people I’ve met from all over the world that do this. It’s great because it makes the world seem smaller — so becoming friends with other people in the sport inspires you when you’re having a bad day.
Ashley has become something of a star over the past few years — a six-time undefeated racer at Mud Endeavor, she also won first place in the 30- to 34-year-old division at the OCR World Championships in 2015, and completed her first Spartan Race trifecta in 2015, finishing at the top of the pack. She’s had multiple podium finishes at Spartan and Battlefrog Races, and finished fifth overall in the Battlefrog point series. Needless to say, she’s setting the bar pretty high — for her competitors, and also for herself.
Ashley, you’ve been involved in this scene since 2012. What was your first race, and how did you first get into the OCR scene?
My first race was a local one called Hog Wild, which I did in order to prepare for Tough Mudder. A couple of people at my job set me up for it and recruited a team, but come race day, everybody bailed — I was the only one to show up! At that point, I was so frustrated, I thought, “I’m going to prove to everybody that I can do this on my own.”
OCR is therapeutic, in a way. It allows you to connect with the fun of playing and being a kid, and it also helps you to set goals, and gives a workout routine a purpose. What draws me to OCR is the element of unpredictability: I love the anticipation of not knowing what comes next and adrenaline rush of accomplishing something challenging.
A lot of people have talked about E. coli and other diarrheal diseases as major deterrents from participating in this. What makes these events worth the risk for you?
I’ve done over 100 races, and I have never had any of these issues. My advice is close your mouth when you are in the mud, shower off post-race, and wash your hands off before you eat. Everything in life has an associated risk: driving to work, crossing the street, or running an obstacle course race. If you spend your life calculating risks, you are going to miss everything that would allow you to live life to the fullest. Not taking risks is the only risk I am not willing to take.
The toughest obstacle for me involved running through a mine. It was pitch black, and I’m afraid of the dark — we had to wear headlamps. We were directed into sub-50-degree water, and I’m admittedly a terrible swimmer, plus I hate the cold. They had lifeguards in boats that would call out to you to check if you were okay — people were going into shock. I went to reply to them and suddenly I couldn’t speak, I couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t touch the bottom — I was shivering and my muscles were cramping. It was like a real-life nightmare, and I starting having a panic attack. Finally, I managed to get out the word, “No!” A lifeboat came over, and was about to pull me onboard. At the last moment, I was able to gather my thoughts, and finally say, “I can do it,” and then I made it out of that mine. But, for a moment, I legitimately thought that I could die. It was just the perfect culmination of all my fears. Conquering that challenge has given me the confidence to know that I can do things I am scared of — and come out stronger on the other side.
What are you looking forward to next in your career as an athlete, and what accomplishments are you proudest of?
I am hoping to return to the OCR World Championship this fall to defend my title as the 30- to 34-year-old OCR world champion. Last year I came in as a “rookie,” and this year I will be coming in with a target on my back. It adds a little stress, but no matter the outcome I will get to see my race friends from all over the world, so it’s definitely an event to look forward to.
My proudest is my OCRWC win, which my parents were there to witness. I got to represent the USA on the podium with women from South Africa and Australia.
That’s easy: Ryker. He’s a 4-year-old little boy with a type of congenital heart defect called CHD, and he lives in Canada. Ryker is the buddy I was matched with through the “I Run 4” Organization, a nonprofit that matches athletes of all levels and kinds — runners, walkers, yogis, and triathletes — with folks who have physical, mental, and developmental special needs. Through this program, I’ve learned that the “obstacles” put before me in racing are nothing in comparison to the obstacles that others are confronted with in their daily lives. “I Run 4” was inspired by the following idea: “I run because I can. When I get tired, I remember those who can’t run, what they would give to have this simple gift I take for granted, and I run harder for them.” And that is why I keep pushing.
Jennette is one badass mom. She’s competed in Savage Race, Warrior Dash, Spartan, BattleFrog… and she keeps making the podium, to boot. But, while OCR is a solo sport, Jennette doesn’t compete (or practice) alone: her kids, ages six and seven, come with her to races that offer kid components, complete with mud pits. “They’ve each done two at this point — Spartan and BattleFrog,” Jenette says. “They love it just as much as Mommy does, and jump in my workouts, too. My kids go flying through the rings and the monkey bars — sometimes they do it better than I do!”
OCR isn’t just about speed — it’s about an all-body strength, and it challenges you mentally, as well. I understand that marathons are very challenging, but personally, I can’t stand just running — I find it boring. OCR events are perfect for me: I like jumping off stuff, climbing over things, falling in the mud, clambering up ropes… that’s right up my alley. My favorite part is that I can monkey around, goof off, have fun — and not even realize that I’m training for these races.
I started racing in 2012 just as a hobby. I started with a local race that wasn’t very big, but I realized that I was outgrowing it when I started winning it. I knew I needed a bigger challenge, but I was worried that I’d be terrible in the big-name ones. But, I kept podiuming at these other events, and realized that, well, I was actually really good at this.
My husband is an amazing supporter: he built me chin-up bars, and then a climbing rope, monkey bars, rings, an eight-foot wall, four-foot wall, and an A-frame ladder wall. It’s helped me engage the community, too. I host a boot camp on Saturday mornings when I’m not racing: I set up stations in a half-mile loop around my neighborhood for anyone who wants to join. Then, friends and neighbors are welcome to come into my backyard to practice the traverse wall and everything else. Some people are a little intimidated about doing the course at first, but they end up saying, “Oh, this is actually a lot of fun!”
I don’t count calories, but I try to stick to as many fresh fruits and vegetables as possible. I still eat brownies sometimes — I’m human — but I try to limit my sugar intake. I think you can definitely feel the effects if you’ve been eating really well, but also if you end up eating something greasy like pizza. I just feel better when I choose to eat clean.
The big BattleFrog rigs that are all upper-body can be really challenging: you’ll have a ring that leads to a ring, which goes to a rope, then monkey bars, then more rings, then a little nunchuck, a pole, a rope, a ring, another rope… that was a bit crazy. Courses like BattleFrog are also mandatory obstacle completion, so if you fall and slip, you can’t just keep running on, you have to start over. People might have to stay there for a couple of hours because they make one misstep or misgrab, and they get more and more worn. You just have to calm yourself and focus, but it’s hard.
My family. When I come back from a race, my kids will say to me, “Where’s your medal, Mommy? Can I see your medal?” It’s such a great moment to teach them that you’re not going to win every race, and to model being a good sport for them. I love telling them, “Mommy isn’t mad that she didn’t win — she’s happy that she had a good time, and she feels blessed that she didn’t get hurt.”

Sometimes environmental problems seem so huge, it’s natural to wonder if there’s anything we, as individuals, can do to help. Most of us already know the three Rs – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. The good news is that there is plenty more that each of us can do, and we can all begin with little changes. These individual things accumulate, all adding up to big success.
One need look no further than the recent rollercoaster gas prices. It was only a couple of months ago that we saw prices go over $4.00 for a single gallon of gas. Nationwide, consumers responded by driving less, consolidating trips, carpooling, and taking other measures to reduce the among of gas they used in their vehicles. Simple economics says that when demand decreases, prices drop. Now prices at the pump are the lowest they’ve been in a few years – under $2.00 a gallon in many cases.
So, what are some other little things each of us can do to help the environment? Here are a few ideas.
Each time a lightbulb burns out, replace it with a compact fluorescent bulb (CFL). They cost a little more initially but use less power and last a lot longer. Over time you save energy and money.
Reuse plastic or paper bags. Most stores now sell reusable bags to tote home your groceries. These are great! However, if you do get plastic or paper bags at the supermarket, find a way to reuse them. Plastic bags make great liners for indoor trash receptacles. Stack newspapers in paper bags before you set them out for recycling. Use a plastic bag over and over to take your lunch to work. Some stores even take them back and recycle them, too.
Turn off things that aren’t in use. Do you have video game consoles at home like X-Box or Wii? The National Resources Defense Council conducted a study and discovered that these consoles use nearly the same amount of power when left on and unattended as they do when someone is playing them! Shut them down when you’re finished your game and you’ll save energy.
The same goes with computers, chargers, and a host of other appliances and gadgets around the house. These all draw energy when left on, even if nobody is using them. Unplug the chargers from the wall and you’ll save even more.
There are three easy things that anybody can do. Not so overwhelming after all, when you look at them as small steps!

From Beatty, we head about 7 miles southeast of town on Highway 95. Our approach road joins 95 at a stop sign. Some concrete ruins (shown on the topo) are visible about a mile NE of 95; the correct road goes right past these. I was able to take my 2wd truck to the end of the road about 2 miles from 95 with no trouble.
Hike north down into a quite beautiful canyon. Exit the upper canyon on a steep but doable ridge when the walls began to close into a "box". The class 1-2 ridge goes very nicely to the crest of the range.
The summit gives great views to the east of the forbidden territory of the Nevada Test Site; Yucca Flats, Frenchman Flats, and Yucca Mountain, the site of the proposed national nuke waste burial vault. What a (literally) eye-popping view one would have had at times from this summit back in the good old days of atmospheric A-bomb tests To the north of the nuke testing area, but still in the Test Site, is the high lonely pinyon-forested plateau country of Timber Mountain :and Shoshone Mountain; seemingly unmarked by man, this was an awesome vision of an enormous expanse of more or less primordial high desert.

Get Help using the Schedules Direct service. NOTE: application issues are probably better resolved via the application's support methods. If you post here, at least include your application name!
By default, MythTV downloads Today+1 and Today+14. (or there abouts). I don't remember if it updates Today.
The networks themselves don't know what's on 14 days from now... so since anything past Today+1 is "14 days old" at the time of download, it's a safe bet that most of your guide is inaccurate.
If you want accurate data with MythTV, IMHO you should *always* do a ---dd-grab-all, at least until SD self-hosts the data and can offer update based listings.
Just wanted to be sure. Doing --refresh-all will hit the SchedulesDirect server(s) for 7 times as much data as using the default; all 14 days rather than just 2. Since Myth always reschedules just after loading the guide data, the only time there will be a problem is if true details of the episode become available after the (daily) mythfilldatabase run and before the recording begins.
Seems to be a high cost of bandwidth to SchedulesDirect compared to a small chance of avoiding a duplicate recording for the user. Is this really a good tradeoff?
It's more than scheduling.. folks look forwarding in the guide for things to record and then complain when the info is not current. If you never look at the guide, you'll probably do fine with the default setting.
When we self-host the data we'll be looking into being able to send "diffs", so the problem will go away.
So if you use the guide, feel free to change your MythTV setting... maybe compromise.. download days 0-6, then 14. (days 7-14 probably aren't accurate anyway)

Pulling this out from older posts. I agree that reloading everything isn't the best but he is right there are many show without subtitles and lost of things that don't get resolved until the last min and sometimes things don't get recorded because the system didn't know the show was repeated in 3 days and recoded it over another show that doesn't because the info hadn't been updated yet. I was thinking +1, +6, +14. An increase of what 33% but that would greatly improve data. Would +7 or +5 be better you guys see the data better then we do?
So where does myth get it's data from anyway. I.e if the networks don't know what's on in 14 days then how doe the program? I find that what it says on the schedule is quite inconsistent with what actually gets shown.
TMS collects data from various networks and stations and compiles them in a similar format. In addition, they collect (or compute in the case of broadcast) lineup information and cross reference it with the program info.
The whole process is quite complicated. Many stations even buy back their own information from TMS after they clean it up!
Accurate details 14 days out are very rare, because the networks change things. 3-5 days is much more accurate.
rmeden wrote: By default, MythTV downloads Today+1 and Today+14. (or there abouts). I don't remember if it updates Today.
By default, mythfilldatabase actually downloads Today, Today+13, and any days between Today+1 and Today+12 that have not already been downloaded. However, some users report that the current day's guide data in MythTV is inaccurate when using the default settings, so it seems that the mythfilldatabase download for Today may not reliably override the previously downloaded data.
Having not played the original Kinect Sports, Season Two stands as my inaugural Kinect Sports introduction. Is it better then it’s primary competition, the standard-bearer Wii Sports Resort?
I’m a big sports fan. I love watching golf, baseball, basketball, football, tennis, I’ll watch racing and hockey occasionally, I watch the World Cup when it comes around and the Olympics are usually a big draw for me. My TV is usually on ESPN News while I work, like when I’m writing articles such as this one. As such, motion collections of sports mini games are fun to me because, honestly, I’m not athletic. The opportunity to act out the sports I enjoy instead of pushing buttons on a controller is usually pretty satisfying. Does this apply to Kinect Sports: Season Two? For the most part, yes. It’s not really very realistic but it is fun.
I do play golf so I’m most picky about that mode. The control is smooth and responsive, making it my pick over Wii Sports’ golf. In fact, I’d pick it over the recent Tiger Woods games for the Wii. There doesn’t seem to be allot of difference in surface types when hitting the ball (I’ve hit clean shots out of over a foot of water in the game, for crying out loud) so that’s a demerit. The fact that you can use natural gestures to look down the course or scope out a putt make sense and fit the game well.
Baseball is fun but extraordinarily basic. You take a stance and swing to hit the ball which works but has little to no depth. Pitching too is more luck then skill. Darts and Skiing don’t do a thing for me.
Tennis is probably my second favorite on the disc. It feels natural to swing your arms around like a racquet to hit the ball. Serving has some hiccups with picking up my swing and tends to interpret my getting in position to serve as a lazy serve attempt. Football is my favorite of the bunch. Thanks to improved voice controls (more on that in a minute) calling plays is a snap and it’s fun to read the field and throw to a receiver when they get open. It’s almost too basic though with no first downs. You have four plays to get the length of the field and that’s all. With that in mind, what’s the point of short hook routes? They can be used on the goal line but 90% of the time you’ll be using the medium or long passing routes. I’ve also had issues with the game not sensing my throwing motion or instead sending the ball to the wrong receiver but those instances have been rare.
It’s obvious that advances have been made in utilizing the Kinect’s tech. For example, the first gen games (in particular, Kinectimals and Kinect Adventures) did not respond to voice commands well if at all for me. Now, even when I’m winded from running down the field in football the game has no trouble hearing what play I’m calling. Similarly the gesture recognition seems to be a step up from the early games. If this progression continues I think that the Kinect may actually have a spot in the future of gaming.
Visually it looks like a bland, generic, muted Wii Sports. Without a roster culled from your army of Miis, the other characters you see and play against are generic and you have no ties to them. It was fun to watch the many Miis I’d created in and around the different games of Wii Sports Resort and I kind of miss that. Sound-wise, I would like it better without the announcers. They’re not interesting to listen to and add next to nothing to the game.
As an authentic sports experience, Kinect Sports: Season Two falls way short. Taken as just a game, however, it’s fun. If you can stand running in place allot and ever imagined yourself on the gridiron or baseball diamond you can have fun here. There’s nothing revolutionary here but that’s not always a bad thing.

Yes this week's challenge at Sentimental Sundays is cute & cuddly (+ a sentiment). We are sponsored by MilkCoffee & I used this cute "Charlotte with Flower& Bird" digi which I coloured with ProMarkers, the papers are MME Howdy Doody (I love these) & I finished the card with flowers, pearls, doily & sentiment. I'm back to work normal hours from today (I was on phased return for the last 2 weeks after breaking my wrist) & went on my bike for the first time, I was a bit apprehensive but it was fine (actually I felt better than I thought it would). Please check out the other DT members creations for more inspiration & I hope you can join us :o)
A beautiful card here and thank you so much for sharing at our challenge at Bearly Mine....hope to see you next challenge..Annie {DT}
I really love the flowers and the pearls as a finishing touch to this card. And what a cute digi image you used. Thanks for playing along at the Oddball Art blog!

When I'm not cutting out, colouring in, surrounded by lots of (creative) mess & covered in glitter I work in a Doctors Surgery. I love all crafts & have had a go at most!
Well I've had my relaxing over Christmas & now it's back to the daily grind but I'm sure I'll fit in some relaxation (hopefully in the form of crafting) somewhere :o) "Time to Relax" is also the name of this gorgeous image for All Dressed Up by the super talented Wendy. Unfortunately my mojo has gone walkabout so I'm not happy with this card & you will see that the other DT members have done a much better job of showcasing it. I used some scraps of paper & some satin hearts I've had forever (New Years resolution coming into play ;o) & finished off with a die cut flower, brad & some pearls.
Don't be hard on yourself, it's a lovely card. A great winter image, fab colours and the layout is perfect xx
What a wonderful card you made... Time to relax... is my motto, if I want crafting... Thanks so much for joining up on our blog bastel-traum... Hugs Ute

So I have torn with the idea of "grown up gingham" for a while now and never thought I would find my self striding along in a gingham top with super puffy sleeves but hey! Stranger things have happened right? I've been seeing this trend popping up all over the place at the moment in various forms of tops, skirts and dress etc. But I thought if I was going to take the gingham plunge I better not 'plunge too deep' and went for this pretty easy to wear shirt from Zara, although the gingham pattern may be a little out of my comfort zone I wasn't willing to compromise on these gorgeous wide-layered sleeves as this has been one of my favourite trends stepping into 2017.
I paired it with these super chic embroidered jeans from Topshop as I feel the two patterns surprising compliment each other perfectly.

Pluto can very rarely appear at the left door of the Office in Five Nights at Treasure Island. He is not hostile.
In the remastered demo's game files, a file named "office_dog" exists of Pluto at the left entrance of the Office. It is unknown if he can appear in the remastered demo.
Photo-Negative Minnie is a normal Minnie Mouse suit, but has photo negative coloring. She also has black, hollow eyes and a huge pair of human-like teeth. It was confirmed by the game's creator, Matthew Phoenix Rodriguez that her starting location will be Character Prep 1.
She is found hanging in Character Prep 1 in TGsEE, and she can be seen in multiple pictures in TBmHC.
Suicide Mouse is a gray-scale Mickey Mouse suit that starts in the Broadcasting Room. When he becomes active, the music from the Suicidemouse.avi mockup will play and the television in the Broadcasting Room turns on. It will remain on for the rest of the night.
When he enters a room, the area around him darkens and, sometimes, certain things will change around him such as the Character Prep 1 posters which will change to an image of his face.
Nightmare Suicide Mouse is an easter egg that will sometimes appear when you switch to the Staff Area in Remastered 3.0. He does not affect gameplay.
On April 4, 2015, 00:00 (UTC), the Wiki went through an Easter update in which literal easter eggs were placed around the Wiki on random pages.

Netball Australia, in conjunction with the Australian Sports Commission, is pleased to launch this online mentoring course for all coaches, umpires and officials of all levels.
Mentoring is a highly effective way for coaches, umpires and officials to learn the 'art' of their role and apply theory that they may have learnt in a classroom or through independent study. Mentoring relationships can be formally structured, with mentors assigned to officials, or they can grow out of a chance encounter with a like-minded person and remain very informal.

Nourish humor and tell stories, so people say — “I felt like I had known him/her my whole life and we had long been friends.”
“From the first moment of my interview with him (Abraham Lincoln) I seemed to myself to have been acquainted with him for years. For while he was among the most solid of men I ever met he was among the most transparent.” Frederick Douglass, author and orator.
“I really think that Mr. Lincoln’s propensity for story-telling has been exaggerated by his enemies. I had once the honor of conversing with him, or rather of hearing him converse, for several minutes, and in all that time he only told four little stories.” Sarah Jane Lippincott, author.
If, like me, you are a stammering Neanderthal when it comes to small talk, the best way to connect with people is to tell a simple humorous story that reveals something about your life. That allows the other person see that you are open and friendly, and they feel comfortable responding to us with openness and friendliness.
My son invited his new girlfriend over to our house for dinner. I made a batch of my heralded spaghetti. When we welcomed her into the house, her handshake was as limp as a wet fish. She only made eye contact with the spaghetti and responded with one syllable answers to the softball questions my wife and I lobbed to her.
I said, “I work as a substitute teacher in an elementary school. Wednesday I was walking my first grade class, in single file, to the library. Everything was going fine until one boy bent down to tie his shoe and all the kids behind fell over him, to the sound of bowling pins falling (in my mind).”
The girlfriend chuckled and the ice started to break. She smiled more, shared information about her family, and was more engaging. At least until our exceptionally friendly dog, Blackie, unexpectedly snatched the spaghetti off her plate.
Of all Lincoln sons, 11-year-old Willie Lincoln’s magnetic personality was most like that of Lincoln himself. Following Willie’s untimely death in 1863, Poet Nathaniel Parker Willis wrote the following article about Willie for The Home Journal. It provides a brilliant example of the prototypical friendly personality. I underlined key phrases.
This little fellow had his acquaintances among his father’s friends, and I chanced to be one of them. He never failed to seek me out in the crowd, shake hands, and make some pleasant remark; and this, in a boy of ten years of age, was, to say the least, endearing to a stranger. But he had more than mere affectionateness. His self-possession—aplomb, as the French call it— was extraordinary.
I was one day passing the White House, when he was outside with a play-fellow on the sidewalk. Mr. Seward (Secretary of State) drove in, with Prince Napoleon; and, in a mock-heroic way—terms of intimacy evidently existing between the boy and the Secretary—the official gentleman took off his hat, and Napoleon did the same, all making the young prince President a ceremonious salute.
Not a bit staggered with the homage, Willie drew himself up to his full height, took off his little cap with graceful self-possession, and bowed down formally to the ground, like a little ambassador. They drove past, and he went on unconcernedly with his play: the impromptu readiness and good judgment being clearly a part of his nature.
His genial and open expression of countenance was none the less ingenuous and fearless for a certain tincture of fun; and it was in this mingling of qualities that he so faithfully resembled his father.
There is a distinct difference between the self-confidence of Willie Lincoln and the self-centeredness of politicians. Yet, making fun of the excesses of their fellow elected officials, is a proven way that politicians connect with constituents. Senator Mo Udall, no exception to the rule, (Too Funny to Be President) illustrates this technique in his story about two congressional colleagues.
George Smathers was running against Claude Pepper in a Senate race. In a speech in rural Florida, Smathers did a euphemistic hatchet job on Pepper. Smathers said,
“Are you aware that Claude Pepper is known all over Washington as a shameless extrovert? Not only that,” Smathers went on, “but this man is reliably reported to practice nepotism with his sister-in-law, and he has a sister who was once a thespian in New York. Worst of all,” Smathers said mournfully, “it is an established fact that Mr. Pepper, before his marriage, practiced celibacy.”
Everybody can relate to the pompous and self-absorbed nature of politicians. Like the kitten that attacks its own image in the mirror, it is reliable approach to share humor and to connect with others.
“About all I can say for the United States Senate is that it opens with a prayer and closes with an investigation.”

The International Accreditation System for Interventional Oncology Services (IASIOS) aims to establish the highest standards for competence and quality in interventional oncology (IO) and its associated activities. The goal of IASIOS is to appraise medical facilities’ IO service lines by granting formal accreditation, as well as encourage and support the development of recognisable standards in IO.
In order to achieve this objective, CIRSE has developed the Standards of Quality Assurance in Interventional Oncology, that offer quantifiable benchmarks for quality and patient safety in IO practice. In addition, these standards outline the requirements necessary for IO facilities to be eligible for IASIOS accreditation.
Launched in 2006, the Bang & Olufsen Serene mobile phone is a classic example of a phone that is all beauty and no brains -- a phone suited more for a modern art museum than for your back pocket. Coming in at more than $1,000, the Serene sported an iPod-style click wheel with a numeric keypad around the wheel. Best of all, the phone’s display was placed under the keypad so, as Bang & Olufsen said, it wouldn’t get dirt smudges from your face.
Our favorite touch: Bang & Olufsen’s decision to position the phone’s camera on the side of the phone. That meant that if you wanted to preview your picture using the Serene’s display, you had no way to face someone while taking his picture.
Because this model looks more like a pocket calculator than a cell phone, we wonder if Samsung was stealing design plans from Casio’s calculator division when it came up with the P300.
This circa-2006 phone was packed with great features for its time, such as a camera, ample storage and a 9mm-thick metal case. But the calculator-sized P300 never really had a chance because -- well, who wants to be the oddball who makes calls on his pocket calculator?
Way before the iPhone, if you wanted a cell phone that Apple helped design, your only option was the ROKR E1. This phone, debuting in 2005, was the disfigured child of a marriage between Apple and Motorola. The phone was one of the first to double as an MP3 player, allowing you to store a measly 100 songs from your iTunes collection.
Part of what went wrong with the ROKR E1 was pre-launch hype followed by dashed hopes. When rumors first started to circulate that Motorola was joining forces with Apple, expectations were sky-high. But instead of delivering something that looked like an iPod-mobile phone hybrid the result looked more mundane -- just another white, plastic, bulky phone.
If you owned the Nokia 7380 and had to send a quick text message to save your life, you’d be dead by now. This handset, which looks like a fancy pencil box, has to go down as one of the most unusable phones ever made. Critics commented that the only thing you could do fast with this phone is answer an incoming call.
Narrow but chunky, the 7380 lacked any sort of physical keypad. One might have thought that this concept was a bit on the nonfunctional side, but, going further, Nokia taunted fashion-savvy buyers with a tiny mirror screen that was completely illegible in strong light or direct sunlight.
Besides the cumbersome text input via the iPod-esque navi-wheel, the 7380 featured only 52MB of storage space (with no expansion slot) -- not even remotely enough to hold a few pictures taken with the handset’s 2-megapixel camera (with flash and video) or many songs for the built-in music player (with FM radio).
Flimsy might be a bit of an understatement when it comes to describing Sony Ericsson’s W350 Walkman phone introduced last year. Mainly an entry-level music-oriented handset, targeted at the youth market, the W350 had no chance at withstanding the wear and tear it would be exposed to by the teens it was intended for.
Shortly after the phone went on sale, owners started posting to Internet forums that the ultrathin phone literally falls apart. Over the W350’s keypad was a wobbly flip cover with music playback controls on the front. Worse, the handset’s battery cover opened too easily, according to many users, who reported online that they lost this cover after only a few weeks of use.
Nokia’s E90 Communicator debuted in 2007 for more than $1,000 (and is still relatively high). It's a mammoth phone, geared, we can only guess, toward those with deep pockets. Deep pockets are required not only to pay the steep price tag, but to ensure that the phone fits in the pocket as well. The E90 measures 2.2 by 5.2 by 0.8 inches and weighs in at nearly half a pound (7.5 ounces).
Apart from its size, the E90 was designed to be one top-notch phone: It comes loaded with HSDPA, Wi-Fi, a 3.2-megapixel camera (with flash and video recording), a massive internal screen, a QWERTY keyboard, GPS, Bluetooth, FM radio, and e-mail options. But with such a big casing, Nokia could at least have equipped the expensive E90 with a standard 3.5mm headphone jack and a sturdier battery cover.
The Xelibri phones from Siemens were all so odd and ugly that we decided to include the entire lineup here. Launched in 2003, the first wave of Xelibri phones was envisioned to be a consumer must-have. Sadly for Siemens, they proved be successful as a spectacle, but were criticized for not coming close to being fully functioning mobile phones.
In the category of “What on Earth is that?” is the Toshiba G450. This strange device is a combination USB broadband modem, cell phone and mobile storage unit. Talk about your digital split personalities!
Basically, this is one of those all-in-one gadgets of 2008 that proves less is more. With only 160MB of internal storage, the G450 was a tad on the skimpy side for a decent storage device. The small screen and the odd split-in-two keypad made it very hard to have any sort of decent use as a mobile phone.
Left only with its metallic color (the phones came in black, silver and pink), the Toshiba G450 proved to be used best as a wireless broadband modem, supporting 3G, HSDPA, EDGE and GPRS connections.
Hopefully, Toshiba learned that three bad implementations of otherwise useful tools into one device doesn’t always work.
Bang & Olufsen teamed with Samsung to create another museum piece called the Bang & Olufsen Serenata cell phone. Launched in 2007, it adopted the same impractical design as its predecessor, the Serene mobile phone (see slide 2).
With the Serenata, Samsung and Bang & Olufsen kept to a similarly weird design, putting the screen underneath the input area, and doing away with numerical keys as well. Only an iPod-esque wheel was left for number and text input. Where you might have expected a keypad, a high-def surround-sound speaker was added (under the sliding top part of the phone). At least one could hear the phone ringing.
The Serenata had some pluses: The phone came with 4GB of memory for storing songs, 3G (HSDPA) connectivity, a 256KB TFT display, USB 2.0 and Bluetooth A2DP support. Bang & Olufsen claimed the device could provide three hours of music playback through the built-in speaker. On the downside, the phone had no camera and sold for $2,000.
Who needs to kill time playing games on your cell when you have Virgin Mobile's Lobster 700 TV Phone? The name is inspired by its lobster-claw-like shape, but if you ask us, the Virgin phone -- with its dreary gray-and-silver color scheme -- is no catch.
Virgin does deserve some credit when it comes to features. With the unit's unlimited mobile TV, the company made the Lobster the first phone to offer mobile TV without added data costs. The only problem: Who wants a phone that resembles a crustacean?
The Lobster was first released on the Virgin Mobile network in October 2006. The phone is no longer available, and the mobile TV service was discontinued in January 2008.
For a phone that runs both Windows and Android, you’d think Compulab’s Exeda would look a little more modern. The boxy handset resembles a squashed Palm Treo, and its multiple navigation buttons seem downright confusing. The phone will support both GSM and CDMA when released; it will also have a touch-screen and a QWERTY keypad with a mini-trackpad. Also featured on the phone are Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, an Ethernet port, a 2-megapixel camera and a MicroSD card slot.
You may have to wait a little bit to get your hands on this ugly duckling -- though the company's Web site says the Exeda will be available for purchase starting this month, there is no word on price or whether a wireless carrier will have the guts to offer it to its customers at a subsidized cost.
The undisputable king of ugliness is the Vertu Bucheron Cobra -- with its sole standout feature being the ridiculous price tag of $310,000. Covered by a gold cobra with 439 rubies and crusted with one pear-cut diamond, one round diamond and two emerald eyes, this phone from Nokia’s deluxe division is not for mere mortals.
Only eight of these tacky monsters were ever produced, but you could get one of the 26 “more affordable” units, which were “only” $115,000, with a python instead of a cobra. If you actually shelled out the money for this grotesque piece of technology, you wouldn’t get any of the high-end specs one would expect for a (2006) phone: no camera, no Bluetooth -- just gems!
However, for the hefty price tag you do get a 24-hour remote concierge (no joke) accessible from a dedicated side-button, who will give you local insight into where to go out, eat and drink, anywhere in the world. We mortals could get this feature from our much cheaper and more-advanced mobile phones, thanks to Google Maps.

Donuts has started to market the now practically prehistoric and newly liberalized gTLD .travel, and it’s signed up GoDaddy to offer domains there.
The registry, which acquired .travel from former owner Tralliance in February, announced a soft relaunch on its blog last week, highlighting that GoDaddy, Name.com and Encirca are now among its registrars.
GoDaddy appears to be only new signing there — Encirca and Name.com have been carrying .travel from long before Donuts got involved and are in fact its two largest registrars.
The big daddy of the registrar space appears to have become interested after Donuts “simplified” the process of registering .travel domains. Donuts said:
Since the acquisition, Donuts has simplified the registration process, enabling registrants to stay on the registrar’s website for the entirety of the registration/checkout process. Donuts believes that this streamlined registration process will increase registrations, as compared to the previous process, which was disjointed and complex for registrants.
What this seems to translate to is: .travel is essentially an unrestricted TLD, despite being applied for in 2003’s round of “sponsored” gTLDs.
If you attempt to register a .travel domain at GoDaddy today, the only additional friction en route to the purchase button is a simple, prominent check-box asking you to confirm you are a member of the travel community.
That’s apparently enough for Donuts to say it has fulfilled the part of its ICANN contract that says it has to carry out a “review of Eligibility prior to completion of all registrations.”
Under its previous ownership, .travel required registrars to bounce their customers to the registry web site to obtain an authentication code during the registration process.
.travel names are still pretty pricey — GoDaddy was going to hit me with a bill of over $110 before I abandoned my cart, and that was just a year-one promotional price.
The gTLD peaked at 215,000 domains 10 years ago but now sits at under 18,000, having seen slight declines every month for the past five years.
Afilias today made the .pro gTLD available to anyone, regardless of their professional qualifications.
The previously restricted TLD was able to do so as a result of its six-week-old contract with ICANN, which loosened many of the conditions former registry RegistryPro originally agreed to when the TLD was delegated 13 years ago.
Under the original Registry Agreements, RegistryPro — since acquired by Afilias — had to verify the professional credentials of potential registrants.
Now that .pro has been brought under something that looks a lot like the 2012 new gTLD RA, it’s pretty much a free-for-all.
despite demand from registrants and registrars alike, .PRO names have historically been denied to professionals from a wide range of fields such as policemen, firefighters, journalists, programmers, artists, writers, and many others.
In my personal experience, it has been possible to register a .pro domain without providing credentials. I’ve been paying for one for a few years, though I’ve been unable to actually use it.
Part of the original deal was that it would be restricted to three classes of professions — lawyer, doctor, accountant — and only available to buy at the third level.
The third-level limitation was lifted many years ago, but .pro continued to be restricted to people who could show a credential.
However, even as recently as 2012 then-RegistryPro-CEO Karim Jiwani was telling DI that the secret to growth was more restrictions, not less.
The registry peaked at roughly 160,000 names in July 2012, and has been on a downward track ever since. It started this July with about 122,000 registrations.
As part of its new deal with ICANN, Afilias no longer has price caps — previously set around .com prices — and has had to implement some of the provisions of the new gTLD Registry Agreement.
One such provision is the Uniform Rapid Suspension policy, which continues to cause controversy in the industry.

Despite this most recent economic downturn and real estate crisis, owning a home remains a big part of the American Dream. It’s not like we haven’t seen ups and downs before. And we’ve always recovered. The market will recover. In some parts of the nation we are already seeing the signs, such as less inventory and an increase in buyer activity, including multiple offers. Yes! That is not a typo. Multiple offers! This is what happens when you price a home right, but that’s an entirely different discussion for another day.
Windermere Real Estate’s most recent monthly market update for the greater Metro Seattle area shows that in October 2011, standing inventory declined by 6% while pending sales increased by 3%. While we’ve heard time and time again that “now” is the time to buy, now may also be a good time to sell. Of course, the decision to sell in any type of market depends on your individual real estate needs and goals.
As well as a decline in inventory (good for sellers), sales prices in October for single-family homes continued a gradual four-month decline. This indicates an ongoing opportunity for buyers.
A recent article by Quicken Loans discusses The Top 5 Reasons To Buyer A Home in 2012. This article begins by reminding buyers that the American Dream of homeownership is a feasible aspiration in this new year. It also reiterates a point above, which is that the market will indeed make a recovery. It states that the housing market often moves in cycles and while there is some uncertainty among consumers as to when home values will increase, we can be certain that they will.
Appreciation – “Buying a home now (at the current rates) can almost ensure your home’s appreciation in the future.”
Property Tax Deductions – “For income tax purposes, real estate property taxes for a vacation home and first home are fully deductible.”
Preferential Tax Treatment – “If you own your home for more than a year and receive more profit than the allowable exclusion after the sale of your home, the profit will be considered a capital asset.”
Equity Building – “Equity builders usually select a home loan with a lower interest rate (and a shorter term loan such as a 15-year fixed) to help build equity faster.”
Pride – “No matter who you are, homeownership is a purchase, commitment, and journey that’s sure to bring you pride.”
Digital artists are generous: community forums for sharing tips in our evolving medium have become small industries. Whether for Flash, Photoshop, or Maya — or whatever the next program will be — all of us are ultimately self-taught; each of us has our own techniques and workflows — those who share, nurture our community and profit from feedback in turn.
Story Artists are generous but with such a complex workflow it can be difficult to ask the right questions. Boards included in “Art of” books accompanying the release of films often only highlight polished “Hallmark” shots; novice storyboards are notoriously overwrought. (For an informative discussion on production vs polished boards watch this video.)
Louie del Carmen’s comprehensive storyboarding tutorial changes the discussion. From script to sequence viewers are lead through production quality boarding in a straightforward, accessible manner. If you have been scouring the internet for tips this tutorial is a treasure.
Louie’s tutorial will pay for itself within minutes if you are not yet using Adobe Bridge. $25 is a gift…wish more Story Artists were as generous as: http://www.cgmwonline.com/Louie-Del-Carmen.html
Here’s a Photoshop script which works well with a Bridge workflow. The cool thing is it makes accidentally over-writing sequential files difficult: as you continue working from a single authoring file activating this script saves filenames in increments of 10. (At the very least it will speed up your workflow by eliminating the need to hand edit filenames.)
After restarting Photoshop the Script should be available under File > Scripts and can be assigned a Keyboard Shortcut, recorded into an Action, used in a Configurator-Panel, or started from the ExtendScript Toolkit itself.

If one keeps loving faithfully what is really worth loving, and does not waste one's love on insignificant and unworthy and meaningless things, one will get more light by and by and grow stronger. Sometimes it is well to go into the world and converse with people, and at times one is obliged to do so, but he who would prefer to be quietly alone with his work, and who wants but very few friends, will go safest through the world and among people. And even in the most refined circles and with the best surroundings and circumstances, one must keep something of the original character of an anchorite, for otherwise one has no root in oneself; one must never let the fire go out in one's soul, but keep it burning.
Whoever chooses poverty for himself and loves it possesses a great treasure, and will always clearly hear the voice of his conscience; he who hears and obeys that voice, which is the best gift of God, finds at least a friend in it, and is never alone.

I beg you, come. Free me from this oppression. All that my heart longs to see accomplished, Goddess, do it. No one could resist if you were fighting beside me.
He seems to be a god, that man Facing you, who leans to be close, Smiles, and, alert and glad, listens To your mellow voice
And quickens in love at your laughter That stings my breast, jolts my heart If I dare the shock of a glance. I cannot speak
My tongue sticks to my dry mouth, Thin fire spreads beneath my skin, My eyes cannot see and my aching ears Roar in their labyrinths. Chill sweat glides down my back, I shake, I turn greener than grass. I am neither living nor dead and cry From the narrow between.
Cast your bread upon the waters, for after many days you will find it again. Give portions to seven, yes to eight, for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land.
If clouds are full of water, they pour rain upon the earth. Whether a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there will it lie.

Sow your seed in the morning, and at evening let not your hands be idle, for you do not know which will succeed, whether this or that, or whether both will do equally well.
Light is sweet, and it pleases the eyes to see the sun. However many years a person may live, let all be enjoyed. But remember the days of darkness, for they will be many.
Everything to come is meaningless. Be happy, friend, while you are young, and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth. Follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see.
If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal. If I have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have a faith that can move mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give all I possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames, but have not love, I gain nothing. Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.
Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. For we know in part and we prophesy in part, but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
Said Myrtias (a Syrian student in Alexandria during the reign of Augustus Constans and Augustus Constantius; in part a pagan, and in part a Christian)
"Fortified by theory and study, I shall not fear my passions like a coward. I shall give my body to sensual delights, to enjoyments dreamt-of, to the most daring amorous desires, to the lustful impulses of my blood, without any fear, for whenever I want -- and I shall have the will, fortified as I shall be by theory and study -- at moments of crisis I shall find again my spirit, as before, ascetic."
Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things.
“Cherish your solitude. Take trains by yourself to places you have never been. Sleep alone under the stars. Learn how to drive a stick shift. Go so far away that you stop being afraid of not coming back. Say no whenever you don’t want to do something. Say yes if your instincts are strong, even if everyone around you disagrees. Decide whether you want to be liked or admired. Decide if fitting in is more important than finding out what you’re doing here. Believe in kissing.”

Welcome to Munchkin 101! This forum is for new Munchkin players to post their questions (and comments). This is not a general discussion forum; please use the main Munchkin forum for extended conversations, detailed explanations of weird corner cases, or other tangents.
1) All questions about a single set plus its expansions are fair game. If you haven't read the Munchkin Frequently Asked Questions, you'll want to do that, but we'll be happy to answer any questions whether or not they appear on the FAQ.
1a) Questions about mashup games (where you play two or more core sets in the same game) are OFF TOPIC. Please ask those questions in the main Munchkin forum.
1b) This is not the forum for questions about Epic Munchkin. Epic play is more suitable for experienced players, and is no longer supported by SJ Games in any case.
2) Anyone is welcome to answer questions, but please answer only the question that is asked and avoid going off on tangents. A one-sentence answer is perfectly fine, as long as it's the RIGHT sentence. If you want to give a more complex answer or include some rare exception to a general rule, use the regular Munchkin forum. Keep it simple here!
2a) Don't post just to agree with an answer. If you disagree, you may post and explain why, but "me too" posts add nothing to the process.
2b) If you aren't absolutely sure of your answer to a question, even if you have a tiny little speck of doubt, do not post your answer. This forum is for definite answers, not speculation.
2c) Followup questions that derive immediately from the original question or the answer to it are fine. Other questions should be asked in new threads here or in the main Munchkin forum, whichever is appropriate.
3) It's good practice to name the specific set you're asking about, unless it's a card such as Warrior or Cheat! that shows up in multiple sets. This is especially important if you're pulling cards from more than one set, for instance if you're using an accessory that came with cards.
4) Please don't post a question on both this forum and the main Munchkin forum. This causes the discussion of your question to get fragmented. Your question will be seen by the people who need to see it regardless of which forum you post it in, and it won't get answered any faster by being in two places at once.
5) As in the other Munchkin forums, we ask you not to quote card or rule text directly. Paraphrasing is fine.

Okay so this season I've really gotten into conquest and I finally understand the appeal my problem is my teammates and my overall play style when I jungle I tend to have my buffs stolen or getting invaded on a constant ( we still win but my teammates suffer) if it weren't for my early game jungle picks I'd be screwed. I'm getting ahead of myself though here are my questions
this has been happening more and more in my ranked matches I've never seen a ADC who wants their support to leave SO bad I don't get it at level 4 I'm just supposed to leave with no farm and no clear and but all but useless because i'm behind then get BM'd all game for not being able to tank/peel for my teammates. Support already has it hard enough being the lowest level on the team and not having enough gold to buy items why make my job any harder I just want to stay in lane a little longer and get some farm and reach level 6 or 7 at least before I leave so that way even if i'm behind I'm not useless. What am I supposed to do when my ADC doesn't want me and my other teammates don't need me?
I've been BM'd relentlessly by my solo laner and Mid laner being pinged and VGS spammed being told to start in mid I know its recommended to start in mid but I've also been told you can start in solo as jungler then make your way over to mid and the way I rotate (Solo-elementals-Solo-Mana/Speed-Mid-etc.) Am I wrong for not listening to my allies do I not get a say in were I start and how I want to play or just like support do I have to do everything everyone tells me or I'm a bad teammate. Can jungle start in Mid/Solo or only Mid?
This happens to me a lot and I don't understand what I'm doing wrong to be honest after a few minutes when I'm out of mana I back then go to my camp on to find it was stolen how can I fix that?I ward my jungle and hurry back as fast as I can but still seem to have my camp stolen.
I tend to play the roles that get BM'd the most (Jungler/Support) people messaging me asking about my build telling me how to play my diamonds asking me why I leveled _______ ability first etc.. and I tend to ignore it but if we lose it's all my fault because I bought one item they didn't like but a question also pops into my head is it my fault and should I have listened to them? for example someone messaged me during the game asking me why I leveled Awilix's 2 and not her 3 for clear I told them because her 2 cost less mana allowing me to stay out longer and because the double damage makes clearing quicker they then proceeded to lecture me about how to play my god the entire game blaming their death on me every time because I was "too slow" getting there we won but my solo and mid lane still harassed me.
It happens we've all ad those games where our emotions get the best of us and we despise the game, our teammates, certain god, and ourselves for our poor performance. Not to mention your teammates don't help by kicking you while you're down so my question is how do you continue when your team is their own enemy? when you're optimism, and efforts just aren't enough to pull it together?
I'd really appreciate the Advice and tips and I'm sure other people who're having the same problems I am would too
It is when someone makes sure they understand all sides of the situation before offering an informed opinion. As they offer there viewpoint they clarify the positives as well as the negatives and make it clear they are only offering their own take on things. This allows the receiver of the feedback to see ways forward, and to feel supported over judged.
1. Give them what they want and act like a back up jungler and when they cry for you to come back laugh.
2. Depends on your solo if its a mana hungry 1 like chaac start mana for him and work towards mid then get red with mid.
4.Go by your gut better yo have someone whos a expert with a revolver than a person who doesnt know how a rifle works
5. I always find it easier to go and laugh at peoples flops when they screw up helps get the annoyance out of the system.
2+3. You need to understand how to jungle, understand the options and routes you should usually go(I'll detail more later)
4. When the teammate says it nicely and backs up his shit cuz otherwise they just look to blame you for their shit.
1. ignore them till ur 5 at least then rotate. if someone dies you can take their wave that would just die to the tower anyway(if ur not needed for anything atm)
2.No ur not jungling wrong lol. When to start is just a choice obviously, you can start in duo if ur supp is going mid or solo even just don't 3 way split early on
3.make them ur focus,try to keep in mind: ok he has the timer he's coming back for it, I need to defend. If u get invaded solo you can get help and setup a trap
5.I'd say don't play when severely tilted, or just try to loosen up play a causal and do something hilarious.
As a support it's best just to rotate out as soon as the adc wants the solo farm. It's not an argument you can win and mid is where most of the action will go down anyway, they'll need you.
As for where you start mid is just the smartest place. If you outclear mid lane you have the option to steal their yellow and red. If you start solo you'll probably end up losing your speed and red but maybe get the enemy blue. Not the best trade off. Plus most times the enemy jungle will start mid and put your mid way behind or even get first blooded and you don't want that
You're probably losing your buffs because with your start they get two of your buffs to start and know the timers. Either wait for it to come back and fight over it or steal the enemy buffs.
Can't help you there because I know how to jungle and I'm not about to listen to anyone else's advice
Mid- Farm, try to stack maybe, and then mid-late game there are going to be alot of people in your lane.
Solo- You don't care about anything until the other solo starts to care. (stay in your lane until you are far ahead or their solo starts rotating)
Adc- Your support helps you in the first 5-10 minutes then leaves, have fun with an all out 1v1 with ganks coming every 5 minutes. Late game, kill everyone and carry.
No no i didnt forget i just find it hard to build the passive for when i want to use it for every ability when the enemy unloads there whole kit on my if i even get close to the wave.

Very nice. I'm wondering if these two fare in the films as they did in the books. What did you use to draw this?
This past Sunday I was sick with a very high fever (I could barely stand on my feet) on the second day of a heat wave in a house that was almost 95 degrees with no air-conditioning that worked and a ****** fan that barely did the job. At some point my dad was able to get the air conditioning to work to a minimal degree. but it was so weak that unless you pulled up a chair and sat right in front of it you could not feel it or be cooled off by it. And that barely worked because I was so sick I couldn't sit upright in the chair for to long and because we don't have a living room set I had no place to lie down where the A.C was. And I had no where else to go but stay in the my hot miserable house. Worst few days ever. I can't remember the last time I was so physically uncomfortable.
Yikes. That seriously sucks. And surely kind of dangerous. Is the AC fixed now? Be careful, these heat waves always seem to have a few casualties in the news.
Good time for lots of ice water, ice cream, freeze pops, etc, to help cool people down from the inside out.
I can definitely relate. Between the heat and my breaks being ridiculously early the past few days, not to mention sleep issues, I have been feeling very run down and tired, to the point that I have headaches and upset stomach. Hope you are feeling better now, as the more one has to be subjected to uncomfortable heat, the worse one tends to feel.
Now, I'm not sure if it's because I've been taking my iron more routinely (been taking Defunct Hannah-Barbara Cartoon Chewables instead of Slo-FE because it's so much better on my stomach and actually ended up a more reasonable dosage...plus some extra vitamins)...but I just started a second "cycle"...two weeks after the last one ended.
And this time I'm actually cramping; haven't done that in a looong time. Hopefully it won't be as bad as the last one, but I'mma need to see a doctor and get a blood test...see how that anemia is doing.
That sucks, bad enough it's got to be every month, but that sucks coming back so soon! Hope it's just a fluke and nothing to have to be bothered with.
Lord knows I once had mine finish up, let me have a break for ONE week then came back for no apparent reason. >.> Sometimes nature just likes to troll us.
Went to work this morning thinking the amount of stock may be lighter since there was a lot last week, esp for the display refresh my supervisor had to do... Nope. They sent us four large boxes pretty much PACKED with cards. Grr. This is a lot, esp during a slow part of the year when they suggest I should have 1 hr 45 min allotted for this store. Uh, no... try over three hours, and I still didn't finish. An entire box's worth was also kids cards that are a whole lot of overstock that we do not need right now. (As it is we already have quite a lot of them stored underneath that we need to get out too...and they send us more?)
Then fought a light headache all morning, and put up with young kids that wanted to practice shrieking just for the hell of it the whole time they were in the store, and an employee of that store that kept hanging around nearby putting things away that would not stop humming to herself, all of that not helping to discourage my headache at all...
when going to buy something say on BestBuy or Target's website. The sites say 35 for free shipping but the item you are buying is $34.99. I hate that
I respect what FW cartoon did for the turtles franchise but it is the most overrated and hard to watch of the 3 turtles cartoons.
The fact that the main AC at work (the one for the eating area, counter, front drive window, and playground) has been out for two days now. It is literally hotter inside the store than out. And it is summer- in Texas. That is insane. It is supposed to be 100+ this week, and our customers and we have no air! One employee even walked out today because the heat inside was causing her health problems to flare up. People are walking out because it is too hot inside to eat. This s**t should NOT be happening, but the owners wouldn't do anything because the thermostat was set to 72. But it isn't working, so that argument is just ridiculous. Seriously thinking about putting a complaint with OSHA.
Oh god, that's awful, I hope they actually bother to do something about it SOON. Why do they even think it's okay? You can't go giving your employees heat stroke because you don't want to bother with it, what the hell. I've been there, having to go home from the heat making me ill from the AC being out a job, but at least I was able to take water with me and sit in my car's AC until I felt better and able to drive home. You being a walker though?
Fortunately, it is working again. I guess they must have gotten it fixed yesterday after I left, because it was back on when I got there this morning. But, yeah, it was bad. Employees xomplain about the heat, a d we get- "oh, it's fine, it's set at 72, you just havve to deal with a little discomfort". But apparently when customers start calling in complaints or walking out.... They finally listen. Ugh, so stupid. It was a literal health issue (and a lawsuit away from getting shut down).
And for the record, it WAS the regional (franchise) manager/owners who were all telling us to deal. And sadly, they've known it was going out for WEEKS. But did nothing because they didn't want to spend the $$ to fix it BEFORE it went out. SMH.
Very poor treatment of employees and in a place where you have heat coming from food being cooked too. Awful.
Which ended up including the egg getting cooked instead of immersing with the sauce. Which there probably wasn't enough of, so...
Well it's a good thing I was helping out someone else's card dept in a store one last time today (before one of my stores is finally set up next week), I checked my accounts and realized that the post office was due to be done this week. Came up on me faster than I realized and I almost skipped it accidentally. Then there was only a half hour allotted for it (unlike the 48 min last time), I'd only ever been there once before but with my supervisor and a month ago, so I'm half panicked and I don't have time to waste trying to message my supervisor. So... I hope I did it right enough...
Then I got home, was talking to my mom and noticed a bird apparently had it's foot caught in the stake she's got up in front of the living room window to hold a bird feeder. Grabbed gloves to go try to free it, but it was too badly stuck. She tried, with bare hands, but...I ended up having to go get scissors for her. Apparently its leg was broken to the point that it was just held together by tendon. Sooo.... she ended up being forced to cut off it's foot.
No way could I watch that, and I don't think I could have done it personally. Fortunately birds supposedly have very minimal amount of nerves and blood vessels there so hopefully it was at least less painful than it would be for us and other creatures. I expected there to be blood after she did it, but it didn't bleed.
Luckily we have a wild bird rescue place in our area we were able to take it up to. It is sadly a lost cause according to them, but at least it can be gently euthanized rather than just be left to suffer or get eaten by something.
missed the worlds most perfectly framed lightning bolt because i turned the camera off one second oto soon..
Getting out of bed in the middle of the night to use the bathroom and banging the sh!t out of your pinky-toe on the bed frame so bad you split the the toenail partially in half. Hurt like hell, OMG! I was legit scared I broke my pinky-toe, but the the nail sustained must of the damage. Woke up with some blood stains on the bottom of my sheets because my split toenail was bleeding. Another layer of suck because I washed my sheets yesterday.
I just a few minutes ago tore off the partially split off toenail because it was hanging almost completely off and anything brushing up against it made it hurt even more.
Grind... When you know you aught to go to bed, but you choose to log back into some game with plans on just a short tour through an area to see if you can get that darn gem to drop from certain mobs and, never getting it, you end up going to bed at 7am and then sleep for just three hours. And the friend who'd previously been on with you will probably want to continue working on part of it together this evening. And her time is three hours earlier, often causing me to stay up rather late as it is on this stuff. Either I won't make it or will be a total zombie playing on auto pilot...
when your forum needs 'villains' to keep things thriving, you just make extra work for yourself. just don't let your own viewpoints cloud your judgment on who the villains are.
started out with a haunted house investigation. We got too scared, and left.....vividly teling ourselves 'don't follow us, stay there..' the people I was with started acting weird at home later, stole their own car. we followed them. we wound up back at the same haunted house. they went in side. but the neighborhood surrounding the house was deserted with fog everywhere.
Once we dared to go inside, the dream turned into a final destination type movie...complete with a death of a person falling into a giant blender.

I'm rocking a 1970 Whaler (Katama Model) that has served me well down here in the ten thousand islands where wakeboard boats run aground...often. I just did a recent refit. Here's what I did
I ride an outboard here as well. Reasons being that wakeboard boats are ridiculously overpriced and an outboard is so easy to maintain! We are running a 1850 Panache (local brand) with a 200hp Yamaha Vmax. Waketower is on, but can only fit +- 250kgs ballast + 9 people. For what we deal with, it produces a decent wake, biggest we've gotten it is knee high.
But does the trick. Guys are still landing some tricks behind it, like tantrums, backrolls and the occasional raley.
With a full cooler in the back and a few ladies on the bow you can get a decent knee high wake. If you can backflip at the speed of light you can land one .
This is my set up Sea fox 1850DC with Tower. Pretty good wake will be bigger hopfully once I add the 500 Lb Fat Sac next week
Here is my 2000 Glastron GX 205. I have big plans to make this boat even better! Good luck to everyone and your personal projects this winter.
Any idea where to get new seats for a pontoon boat. Not looking to spend a fortune on something that does not get used a lot.
Author: manning, Location: Northern Ohio USA Posted: Thu Jun 09, 2011 4:56 pm Post subject: Windows 7 Network Configuration Operator does nothing?
So yet another mystery to me as I deploy these new computers is why adding somebody to the Network Configuration Operators group appears to do nothing. I've searched and found many references to this same issue on Windows 7, bot no solutions.
If I add a user to the built in NCO group on a computer, they should be able to do things like change TCP/IP settings, correct? Does something need to also be enabled or disabled in GP?
The school experience. School related queries, discussions, and stories that aren't specific to a subject.
These are the forum rules in their most simple format. Explanations of each rule can be found in the following post. Some forums have additional specific rules that can be found in stickies and announcements in the appropriate areas.
2. Use the Report This Post button on rulebreaking posts rather than replying to them. Do Not Reply To Spam.
3. You cannot post any links before you have reached five posts. < - Reworded and expanded below to explain our new spam blocking features.. IF YOU HAVE ANY SORT OF LINK AT ALL IN YOUR POST, THE POST WILL NOT BE READ BY A MODERATOR, IT WILL JUST BE DELETED.
5. Try and keep off-topic posts controlled. If the thread you want to post in seems off-topic, post anyway. On-topic posts always take precedence over off-topic.
6. Please keep posts entirely consisting of "QFT" or "seconded", "thirded", etc. at a minimum. If you don't have anything to contribute to the conversation, then by all means don't.
8. Do not cross post in multiple boards. You may link to existing posts and threads when relevant, but do not reproduce them entirely.
10. Do not post blocks of coloured text. Red text is reserved for mods, so please do not use any shade of red at all.
12. Handle moderation concerns through the proper channels - do not start a thread about it, and do not derail a current thread to discuss it. PM the moderator in question, or if that's not known, PM Azrael or SecondTalon.
13. If you have any questions or issues or anything you'd like to talk to us about, feel free to PM a moderator and we'll see what we can do for you.
When you submit your first post, it will be dropped into a queue to await moderator approval. Until it clears all your other posts will also drop into the queue.
Members with <5 post count can't enter a website, create a signature, PM multiple users or have links in posts. Or rather, they can, but the post will be denied without being read. Even yours. You are not special, and whatever you’re trying to link can wait.
Low quality “Thanks” “Great post” style posts will also be denied as these are 99.999% of the time a spambot, not a person.
We all share these forums, and we're all mature, responsible people. We don't really need people being immature, spamming, flaming, any of that - if you want to post on the forums, it should be because you enjoy interacting with people on this sort of level, not because you want to go making an arse of yourself everywhere. Warnings will be issued for posts that are deemed disrespectful and in breach of this rule. Serious breaches may result in temporary or even permanent bans.
This is the report post button, as you would see in prosilver. Use this to notify us of threads in which you would like some moderator action to be performed.
- Reporting duplicate threads. When notifying us of duplicate threads, please include the URL of the already existing thread. Reports simply saying “Been done” are not helpful.
All you need to do is throw up the report, and then business as usual. Do not post in the thread to tell someone they've broken a rule without reporting it, and preferably, don't post in the thread to tell someone they've broken the rule at all. It derails the thread, and makes more work for us by making problems harder to find and reports harder to deal with.
Importantly, do not reply to spam. If you think something is spam in a thread, do not reply to it, do not acknowledge it, do not quote it, just go about your business and pretend it's not there. If it's a brand new thread the spambot created, do not reply to it. Report it and then pretend it doesn't exist.
Lastly, when a report is dealt with, it is dealt with. If it is not done exactly as you wanted or anticipated, there are good reasons for it. Please do not continue to throw up reports on threads if nothing else that needs our attention has happened.
Please do not post any links or perform any form of self-promotion until you have a post count of at least five. We have our reasons. Not all spammers are bots, and it can be hard to tell the difference between somebody pointing out somebody else's cool webpage, somebody advertising out their cool webpage, or someone posting malicious links. Because of this, if you have any links in your first post, the entire post will be deleted. Also, pushing your post count up to five with useless posts and then posting your link and vanishing will go over poorly.
“But my link was relevant to the conversation and I think by post was blocked without a moderator even reading it!”
Oh. Gosh. Whatever shall we do. A moderator didn’t read an entire post before blocking it. Gosh. If only there were rules explaining this that should have been read first. Gee golly. What a shame.
That said, there is a list of acceptable and unacceptable words or fragments that first time posters can and cannot use. www will be immediately flagged as spam, as will .com or http. This means that if you fail to hit space between a period and the word commence, it will be blocked as spam as it hits the ".com" flag. You will get a message stating "This message has been flagged as spam and has been blocked" if you attempt to do so. This will go away once you have a few posts under your belt. We do apologize for this inconvenience, but your momentary inconvenience is outweighed by our convenience of not having to block 500+ spam messages a day.
No forum needs five threads dedicated to the same thing. If you want to create a new thread, search first to see if a thread has already been created. There is a search function at the top right at the page, and search tips available in Guide to the forums for newbies. Chances are, if we have an existing thread, we're just going to lock or delete any new ones and post the link to the proper thread. Threads we want you to use for popular topics of conversation are listed for you in the Forum Guide for newbies sticky at the top of General. (If you have any suggestions for threads to be added to this list, please PM hermaj.) Similarly, if you're having issues with the site or forums, please check out the Site/Forum Issues FAQ before posting your query.
Off-topic posts are rife in this forum. We maintain a very casual atmosphere here where conversation can flow quite freely - however, we have our limits. If off-topic posts get too over the top, the thread may be split or locked, so try and keep off-topic posts controlled. You are welcome to start a new thread and continue the new discussion there, or throw up a report if you feel it is necessary for us to split the thread.
These posts just aren't necessary without some additional comment, and will be removed or otherwise edited for our amusement. If you don't have anything to contribute to the conversation, then by all means don't.
To clarify, double posting refers to any two posts in a row made by you, even if they have completely different content. If you’re addressing multiple people, all your replies go in the same post. You are able to easily quote as many people as you like by scrolling through the thread review and hitting the quote button, so there should be no excuses.
The only time double posts may be permitted is to bump threads. There is a brief outline of situations in which it is okay to double post to bump available here; if you are at all uncertain, please PM a mod.
This refers to creating exactly the same thread in several boards, either to ensure it is in the correct board or because you want as many people as possible to see it. Cross-posting will do nothing but ensure that all instances of the thread are deleted. If you’re not sure where to post a thread, post it in the most likely forum and we will move it if we think it is wrong.
Cross-posting does not refer to linking to other relevant posts and threads within existing posts and threads. This is always acceptable. Posting in other threads about how you need help in your thread with a link to that thread to try and maximize the views of your thread just makes you seem clingy, needy, and a bit whiny.
We will instantly, permanently ban anyone we see posting a link that leads to a browser-crashing prank, the most notorious one here being a browser-affecting Rickroll. It is not funny. It is dickish. Posting any sort of link that negatively affects a user's browser, such as creating dozens of popups, javascript or otherwise, will get you banned. Regular YouTube rick-rolls will probably not get you banned, but they are still stupid and highly frowned upon.
We don't care that it works fine on your end. We don't care that you think it was funny and it was just a joke. Many of us browse the forums with multiple browser windows or tabs open, many times in the middle of writing out posts or messages in other tabs or any other sort of work. Something that causes steals control from the user until the user jumps through a series of hoops is not funny. Ever. Especially if said hoops cause the browser to crash, resulting in the loss of data on the user.
Coloring a word here and there is fine, but please don't post blocks of coloured text. The fora become a headache-inducing rainbow of unreadableness. Red text is reserved for mods, so please don't use any shade of red, even in small amounts.
Keep signature images to around 100 px vertically. Also keep the filesize down. This is to help the dial-up users (Yes, they still exist!) as well as not stretching the length of the page unnecessarily. Also keep in mind that generally, even signature images within the size boundaries are tolerated, not encouraged.
12. Handle moderation concerns through the proper channels - do not start a thread about it, and do not derail a current thread to discuss it. PM the moderator in question, or if that's not known, PM Belial.
Moderator concerns are to be dealt with privately. If you are unhappy with a decision made by a moderator, PM the moderator in question, or if that's not known, contact Belial. If you're not sure which moderator it was, and the situation occurred in an area looked after by one or more magistrates, they should be your first point of call for that area. In any case, it's a good idea to PM a mod that frequents the board you're having issues on for a faster response.
Do not shop around among the moderators until you get the response you want. We do all talk to each other, and that will likely only make things worse for you. If, however, after speaking to a moderator you still feel that your situation was not dealt with appropriately or fairly, you may bring it to an admin.
We are not big scary angry people! If you have any questions or issues or anything you'd like to talk to us about, feel free to PM a moderator. If you do not want to PM, you are more than welcome to utilise the Site/Forum issues forum to clarify issues or request features.

Don't know. Don't really care either. Even if all you manage to do is reduce fuel consumption by 20%, or 10%, you've knocked out a huge amount of fuel consumption. Maybe you manage to bring it down to something reasonable for battery storage. There is no "all at once, solve everything" solution. There are lots and lots of incremental solutions.

Eh, if it's an entire redundant power system for only 10% of power, you're adding a crapton of complexity, maint costs, etc. Not to mention cluttering up the topside.
There's fairly low downsides with having a variety of land based power plants, but relying on multiple power sources for vehicles seems to be usually undesirable. The *vast* majority of them appear to use a single fuel source, which indicates that generally, weight/space/etc concerns outweigh the advantages of diversification.
Depends on the core technology. Obviously, adding an additional power source to a ship that is currently diesel powered is difficult. Adding an additional electric power source to a ship that is presently diesel-electric would be simple. At present, diesel electric ships are rare, because ships spend the vast majority of their time at full power, chugging across the ocean, so they don't need the (slight) increase in complexity of a diesel electric system over the existing diesel with power take-off. (Unlike rail engines, which benefit from using the diesel-electric connection as a transmission.) However, if you manage to knock 10% of the fuel cost off with an auxiliary electrical source that displaces little or no cargo space (picture something like flexible solar tarps that lay over containers), that would more than justify the cost of the diesel electric complexity. To say nothing of things like the kite-sail I linked to, which takes up a tiny little bit of fore-deck space, uses existing auxiliary power for control, and can knock maybe 5% off fuel costs.
Dan, at what point does it become obvious that it is more efficient to put those turbines on the land somewhere and use the energy to chemically make diesel? Or better yet, find a carbon neutral plan for biodiesel?
Just because you can stick sails on a container ship doesn't mean that you should. Yes we need to do something. That doesn't mean we need to try every dumb idea that occurs to us.
DanD wrote: Some people seem to be missing that you can travel faster, tacking, than you can directly downwind. In fact, many racing vessels will tack even when sailing downwind, because their net speed is faster. This is because windpower is the cube of wind speed. The sail can never travel faster than the wind speed downwind. Across the wind, you can extract more power, because the excess is exerted by your keel on the water to produce lateral motion.
"Tacking" is turning through upwind, so to tack while going downwind would mean doing one of those fancy ruffled underlines you sometimes see on signatures.
{Much stuff deleted here because the obvious point that a boat on a dead run isn't going at wind speed had escaped me.}
The sail's polar diagrams are a powerful tool to compare sails (alone), nevertheless, it is necessary to appreciate the whole boat behaviour, from the aerodynamic of the sails, as well as from the hydrodynamics of the hull. The VPP (velocity prediction program) are codes that take into account the performances of sail(s) (sail polar diagram) and hull(s) (resistance versus speed curve), and the boat stability, to simulate the behaviour of the boat for different true wind angle, and true wind speed. The following diagram is a typical boat polar diagram produced by a VPP (the scale of the grid pattern is in knots)
Hull shape, hydrodynamics, trim and balance et cetera ... and particularly, I'd think, having one sail partially masking the other.
Faster downwind on a broad reach than on a dead run in low wind speed but faster in a dead run than on a broad reach in high wind speed.
All that comes down to "It depends on the weather conditions and which way you're trying to go," which we already knew.

It doesn't mean you shouldn't, either. In fact, I would argue that you should try "every dumb idea that occurs to us" at least to the level of a basic feasibility study, or a literature search to see if it's already been tried. I linked to a specific instance of "putting sails" on a cargo ship seems to be beneficial. It's in test and early deployment phases, and the complete data isn't in yet, but the benefit seems to be there. Whether it would work on a full scale container ship obviously hasn't been tested yet, but it does seem to work on bulk carriers.
If you can figure out how to reliably deploy solar on a container ship, and if it would produce enough power to justify a diesel electric power train, and whether the amount of fuel saved would justify in terms of cost or in terms of extra cargo capacity, it needs to be studied. Maybe we can't. Maybe there's another breakthrough in battery tech required first. Maybe it's completely impractical. But unless you've given it more thought than I've seen in this forum, it's kind of a hard to make any absolute statements.
Which isn't an issue with a wind turbine. It can face into the apparent wind, regardless of the direction of travel, pitch it's blades for optimum tack at the windspeed available, and provide power to a propeller in the direction of travel.
Oh, and the "faster on a dead run in a high wind" is a function of the sail's limits. It would always be possible to design a sail for a particular wind speed that would be faster in a broad reach, it's just not possible to design one sail that is always faster. Specifically, that sail has reached the point where it is at it's mechanical limits in a dead run. At that point, the geometry of the shorter course predominates. The physics still allow it to extract more energy on a broad reach, but doing so risks catastrophic failure. (In fact, I suspect the chart recommends reefing the sail if wind increases any more).
The fact is that feasible alternatives exist. We have existing carbon-free power generation, but I keep seeing people pushing wave power and solar roads and other patently inefficient alternatives. We have nuclear ships and biodiesel, but people still want to put rotors on their ships. This can be worthwhile for the owners if they get enough in tax breaks or new investment, but it's clearly not the best use of funds from a societal standpoint.
Transitioning to alternative energy is extremely expensive. And it is an immediate need. It makes sense to concentrate on the best options rather than spread the very limited available funds among all possibilities. That necessarily means we can't fund every project.
I don't really care either. And the fuel savings will be a function of the adoption rate of whatever technology. Although Skysails looks promising.

People are doing exactly as you suggest And you better hope they figure it out, since the trade network is going to need to expand as the population does. Have we ever used less fossil fuels than the previous generation?

Given the way most cargo ships are cared for, and how limited regulation is, I would consider privately owned nuclear cargo vessels to be a disaster waiting to happen.
Nuclear plants powering bio-diesel generation, fine, but keep the nukes where a host country can control them.

The "surface air temperature" section in the "temperature measurement" article gives some description, as does the linked section of the "instrumental temperature record" article, though it was the "surface weather observation" article that I had just found when I originally suggested that maybe you're not so good at looking for information yourself.
No. None of those define what the global surface temperature is. They explain quite a lot about what measurements are made, but that is not the same thing. To see why this is so, consider mass. Mass is very commonly measured using a spring scale (especially nowadays using electronic strain gauges). However, it would be a fundamental error to try to define mass using measurements from such an instrument as it would vary from place to place. If you were to define mass as the result of any measurement, it would have to be a measurement using a balance scales instead, as that merely compares two masses, so is (potentially) much more accurate.
In theory, it's possible to define a property solely by reference to a measurement. This might be something like IQ, where a test is devised which provides a repeatable measurement, so a term is invented to describe what is being measured even though nobody really knows what it is. A physical example of this might be your oven temperature. You might bake something by having the control knob at 180. That's a somewhat arbitrary number. It may mean that the heating element is kept at precisely 180° C, or that the air temperature at the top (or some other part) of the oven stays at 180° C, or that the surface of the baking tin stays at that temperature. You don't know and don't care. This is why your friend might say that they set their oven to 190. The number does not represent a particular physical quantity, but depends on many and therefore cannot be precise, since the thing it represents is inherently vague.
However, I presume that when a climate scientist publishes measurements, models and analysis, the quantities are intended to correspond to an exact physical quantity - and differ from that theoretical (unknowable) value because of practical difficulties. This is obviously essential if measurements taken in different ways are intended to be describing the same physical thing (e.g. temperature from traditional observatories being compared against satellite observations). Consequently, when referring to something such as "global surface temperature" in a serious scientific context, it's essential to either define exactly what that means, or to have a broadly accepted definition that everyone can refer to.
If you work on your stove, quit. And I don't think you cook. The number on the knob is a referent to the temperature at the sensor. Which can be fairly accurate. The variation of temperature in the stove comes other factors. The knob marker is the set point at which the gas valve cycles on and off. But the purpose of the stove and the temperature you run at are about heat energy which is a function of the gas valve. And it is how they are rated. Some numbers of btu's.
It depends on what kind of nuclear power generation you are using. I don't want every Tom, Dick, and Harry making their own fission reactor on their yacht. I don't even want every shipping company operating a nuclear ship (and they don't want that either). But that is not the only way to go.
Not really. It looks like the area swept by the turbine blades would be comparable to the combined area of the conventional sails that such a boat would use.
That would suggest that the turbine is no more effective than a sail on that particular vessel, which means it can't really be used as evidence that turbines are more effective than sails.

What surprises me is that no one seems to remember how much of the railways were electrified a hundred years ago. Nearly all the steep grade or long-grade rails were electrified in long segments to cut out the carrying of all that damn fuel (although it was mostly competing with steam).
morriswalters wrote: What surprises me is that nobody has questioned why freight in the US train system is driven by diesel. Which drives electric motors.
"Diesel-electric powerplants became popular because they greatly simplified the way motive power was transmitted to the wheels and because they were both more efficient and had greatly reduced maintenance requirements. Direct-drive transmissions can become very complex, considering that a typical locomotive has four or more axles. Additionally, a direct-drive diesel locomotive would require an impractical number of gears to keep the engine within its powerband; coupling the diesel to a generator eliminates this problem. An alternative is to use a torque converter or fluid coupling in a direct drive system to replace the gearbox. Hydraulic transmissions are claimed to be somewhat more efficient than diesel-electric technology."
What, no? You will have to use whole sentences. MW is mega watt, watt is energy per time, without a time span it doesn't translate to an amount of fuel.

Fuel is an ongoing cost that doesn't go away when you switch. Electrification is a huge, up-front capital investment not only for the track owner, but also for the operators who have to replace all their perfectly functional rolling stock. And given their track record for installing critical safety systems...
Unless stated otherwise, I do not care whether a statement, by itself, constitutes a persuasive political argument. I care whether it's true.

No. That's not how ovens work. Ideally, the middle of the oven is where the set temperature occurs, and since the sensor will be mounted on the wall, it does not switch at the nominal temperature. The gas will be triggered on when the temperature falls, and off when it rises, but there will be hysteresis, so these are not the same temperature. A domestic oven for cooking is not a precision instrument so, as supplied, it is not carefully calibrated to produce an exact temperature, and is not designed to be highly accurate over its lifetime. Cooking uses natural ingredients, which have inherent variation (e.g. the size of eggs) so it would be pointless trying to achieve high precision - instead food is tested to decide when it is done.
Yes, I know. The principle is used in HVAC as well as stoves. As well as any other process that operates about a set point. The probe is accurate. Hysteresis is added intentionally. Why it's added and why you need it is the point. By the way, I said fairly accurate, not precisely.
If one of those kites cuts fuel consumption by 5%, what would twenty of them do? I'm sure it doesn't nearly add up to 100%, but it could cut fuel costs a decent chunk, and that means that the strain on the power grid to make biodiesel or hydrogen for container ship fuel is less scary (not that container ships are the major part of "transportation costs" anyway).
And container ships with huge clusters of kitesails are no more intrinsically ridiculous than container ships burning petroleum diesel. They might even be cute.

The idea of putting multiple sails on a ship is not revolutionary. That you cannot understand just how far back in time you are trying to take shipping is shocking to me. Sails don't just provide less thrust than diesel motors, they provide practically none by comparison.
Sure, if sails or turbines or whatever can improve efficiency by some margin that somebody can make use of, great. By all means, reduce fuel consumption by a gallon here and there. But it is not a solution to the more basic problem that we consume billions of gallons of fuel for shipping every year. I have no objection to improving efficiency. I do object to expecting a fleet of sailboats to replace modern shipping.
Yeah to me the stove is the cooking surface and the oven is the insulated box you bake/roast/broil stuff in.
Ridiculous is when you have too much lateral force, and roll your whole ship. This is also, particularly for tankers, considered not great environmentally.
The stove, is techncally the internal bit where the burning happens, in whatever form. But IME can apply to the whole unit (c.f. 'range') or qualified like as with the hobs (whether or not they are independent burners or heated by the internal stove-proper, 'on the stove') or oven box (again, with gas burner making it a' true'stove in its own right or connected to the seperate burn-box-stove/fireplace, 'in the stove'). Heck, even 'under the stove' (grill) would work.
Also can be primarily a room-heater (wood/etc burning legged iron construct which is mostly combustion chamber with a 'stove pipe' out the back to pass exhaust gasses outside through the wall or ceiling), but I'd expect at least a 'hob' atop, whether or not anybody actually uses it for cooking or heating water on...
More to the point, who uses gas ovens? Even in the places I've lived that had gas hobs, the oven was electric.
It's new to me that there are temperature gerulated gas ovens. I thought they are only working at a set gas valve value.

You just reminded that what we call "gas mark" (the temperature setting) can also be referred to as "regulo". Apparently Regulo was a make of gas regulator. Having said that, a gas regulator normally regulates the flow rate as opposed to the temperature, so I wonder whether it goes back to earlier ovens where the temperature itself wasn't in the feedback loop. This might explain why an arbitrary numbering scheme was used rather than a temperature.
My mum had a gas cooker. It was all in one: oven, hob and grill. Connecting it up to the gas and electric would have been an unnecessary faff. And I expect gas was seen as the fuel of the future following the discovery of natural gas in UK waters. But gas ovens have gone out of fashion now.
I'm pretty sure that every place I've cooked with a gas range has also had a gas oven with temperature markings on the dial. As far as I know this is very much the norm for gas cooking in the US.
I don't know how the gas flow is actually regulated in such ovens, but I've done and eaten enough successful baking in gas ovens to know it must be fairly close to the number on the dial.

In the US a stove does mean the complete unit, to a point, specifically, we still have wood stoves or pellet stoves. You might buy a stove or an oven at the store if you want the complete appliance with both. However, a unit with just burners (and we do refer to electric units as burners, although you might here "coil" as well due to the shape) might be referred to as a stove top, frequently contracted to just stove, or a range. A unit without burners would be just an oven. Both are available solo, but neither is as common as a combined unit.
Both range and oven are also common in gas or electric. Gas ranges provide more precise control, and a faster cool down when shut off, both advantages. Gas ovens are more energy efficient (since they lack the thermal->electric->thermal sequence of electric generation), and are common when city piped gas is available. To counter that, modern convection ovens tend to be more efficient, and they aren't as available in gas.
Gas or electric ovens in the US almost always have temperature control. In both cases, it is simple on-off thermostatic control, no flow regulation. Between control error and hysteresis, you're maybe 10-20 degrees off worst case, most of which is control error, which is fine for many things. A more accurate thermometer can be used to adjust for control error if you need higher precision.
Stove tops, burners, ranges, whatever, however, both gas and electric use a proportional control, and that is entirely based on a non-temperature/non thermal energy numeric scale.

I expect many of my readers who are based in the U.K. will have been following this story as I have (and I'm sure overseas readers will be interested to hear about this project too), but only now do I feel justified in posting about it since it has (finally!) ended in practically complete success.
I can hardly believe that it has been nearly 3 years since I featured on this blog the news that the only known intact example of a Second World War German Dornier 17 bomber had been discovered resting in shallow water off the Kent coast. In that time numerous dives had been made to study the wreck and devise a way to raise it from the Goodwin Sands - a plan that was put into action (as originally envisaged) last month.
Alas the English Channel was not keen to relinquish its grasp of this aeroplane and it has taken until now - over a month from the anticipated salvage date - for it to finally see daylight for the first time in 70 years. It has been a remarkable feat of engineering - not to mention patience! - to bring this aircraft out of the sea in as near as dammit one piece and one that very nearly looked like not coming off at all. Thankfully all the time and money invested in this endeavour looks to have been worth it as the world's only extant Do17 airframe begins its new journey to the RAF Museum at Cosford, where it will undergo extensive restoration over the next two years and then eventually form a suitable counterpoint in the Battle of Britain exhibit at the Hendon museum. Quite what form this will take I'm not sure, as I had thought the original plan was to keep it pretty much as it was found and the museum website talks about "conserving" it, but maybe they feel a full restoration is possible and desirable. No doubt we shall see come 2015! I shall look forward to continuing to follow Dornier 17 5K+AR's story over the next two years and hope to see it, in whatever form, at the RAF Museum in the future.

Rolling is a process where the metal is compressed between two rotating rolls for reducing its cross sectional area. This is one of the most widely use of all the metal working processes. Because of its higher productivity and low cost. Rolling would be able to produce components having cross sectional through out its length. May shape such as itl and channel section are possible , but not very complex shapes.
Rolling is normally a hot working process unless specifically mensions as cold working. The metal is taken into rolls by friction and subsequently compressed to obtain the final shape.
The thickness of the metal that can down into rolls depends on the roughness of the roll surface. Rougher rolls would be able to achive greator reduction than smoother rolls. The reduction that would be achieve with a given set of roll is designed as the angle of the bite. cold rolling is done bellow the recrystallization temperature of the metal , hot rolling is done when the metal pieces at uniform working temperature.

Rebecca Solnit says in The Faraway Nearby, “time itself is our tragedy and most of us are fighting some kind of war against it.”
As her mother deteriorates with Alzheimer’s, author Rebecca Solnit inherits the last fruits from her mother’s tree: a hundred pounds of “unstable” apricots. “The apricots were a riddle I had to decipher, a tale whose meaning I had to make over the course of the next twelve months as almost everything went wrong.” Some apricots spoil and some ripen, while Solnit contemplates impossible tasks, lost daughters, complicated mothers. Just as she seems poised to address one part of the riddle, another part collapses. “I got asked over and over …whether she still recognized me. Recognition can mean so many things, and in some sense she had never known who I was.” Like many adults with ailing parents. Solnit reckons with too much challenge, too little time, and problems too confounding, yet her life fills with odd beauties and moments of grace—enough for her to survive.
Tracing community responses from the 1906 San Francisco earthquake to the Halifax explosion, Mexico City earthquake, New York City after 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina, along with dozens of other related disasters along the way, Rebecca Solnit makes a strong case in her new book A Paradise Built in Hell: The Extraordinary Communities That Arise in Disaster that it is in the emergent and innovative communities after disasters that a glimpse of another more hopeful world is visible. These communities are marked by “altruism and mutual aid …the practical mustering of creativity and resources to meet the challenges…a dispersed, decentralized system of decision making…connection, participation, altruism, and purposefulness. Thus the startling joy in disasters” (305-6).
As the men with the knives dragged the thieves, the crowd jostled for a better view. Minutes later, four young men lay bleeding, each without his right hand and left leg. Some of the onlookers collapsed in fear. Others cheered. This was in June, in Somalia, as reported in the New York Times.
No surprise there, many would say—nothing but one more dismal demonstration of humankind’s worst impulses. “Man is a wolf to man,” Thomas Hobbes declared three centuries ago, and the sentiment was old then. But in his remarkable new book, The Age of Empathy, Frans de Waal contends that Hobbes managed to malign both animals and human beings in the same breath.
Humans are social animals, de Waal observes, and natural selection has shaped us to cooperate, share, and empathize as well as to compete, fight, and maim. The same holds for chimps and gorillas—and wolves. “Don’t believe anyone who says that since nature is based on a struggle for life, we need to live like this as well,” writes de Waal. “Many animals survive not by eliminating each other or keeping everything for themselves, but by cooperating and sharing.”
De Waal has two big goals in his compact book. One is to counter the argument that “every man for himself” is a law of nature. Economists and political thinkers, proclaiming themselves the spokesmen for clear-eyed realism, long ago took a horrified look at the natural world and declared that it is a jungle out there. Competition is ruthless and perpetual, and animals are gladiators with claws and fangs.
(Reviewing coming soon in the ERB)http://www.believermag.com/issues/200909/?read=interview_solnitTHE BELIEVER: I’ve seen you referred to as an art historian, a landscape writer, and an art critic, if not more. How do you consider your own work and writer’s identity?
REBECCA SOLNIT: In Wanderlust, I wrote, “This history of walking is an amateur history, just as walking is an amateur act. To use a walking metaphor, it trespasses through everybody else’s field—through anatomy, anthropology, architecture, gardening, geography, political and cultural history, literature, sexuality, religious studies—and doesn’t stop in any of them on its long route. For if a field of expertise can be imagined as a real field—a nice rectangular confine carefully tilled and yielding a specific crop—then the subject of walking resembles walking itself in its lack of confines.” I have a very clear sense of what I am here to do and what its internal coherence is, but it doesn’t fit into the way that ideas and continuities are chopped up into fields or labeled. Sometimes I say I’m an essayist, because that’s an elegant, historically grounded—if sometimes trivialized—mode of literature, while nonfiction is just a term for the leftovers when fiction is considered to be paramount, and creative nonfiction is even more abject a term.
RS: Well, people want to call you something, and saying you’re just a writer is not enough. Not that I’m comparing myself to them, but Orwell wrote memoir, fiction, polemics, beautiful essays, reviews, ruminations, and tirades; Sontag wrote mostly essays, a few at length, some dealing with broader ideas and genres, some dealing with politics and ethics—and then there are her novels. I love best the nonfiction of a lot of people celebrated mostly for their fiction, from Virginia Woolf to Jamaica Kincaid. The best part about the critical training I got in the visual arts is that it was really just about reading things carefully and asking questions about meaning. The subject could be an artwork, but it could also be the history of nuclear physics or national parks or the representation of Native Americans or the perceptual and spatial changes the railroad brought.

I was asked by the Islamic Center of Passaic County to produce a short video introducing Marwa Aly (MY WIFE!!) to their community.
I was asked by the Islamic Center of Passaic County to produce a short video introducing their new youth development manager, Yousef Bakeer, to their community.
After a call with Yousef, I wrote the script, then met up with Yousef to record it. The entire process took less than one day.
Yousef has a great outlook on life and is full of energy, I can’t wait to see the good things he will accomplish.
This video was inspired by an article that Imam Zaid Shakir published in January of 2018, called "This is Who We Are."
I was so moved by the piece that I decided to make a video about it. I took the original script and molded it into a video friendly one, then contacted Gareth Bryant, who also loved the script, and asked him to narrate the piece.
We rented a studio space in New York City and some lighting equipment and shot it in a few hours. Here are some of the behind the scene photos:
The tricky part today is in the editing room, where we now have to cut videos for Youtube (1920x1080), Facebook (Square, or sometimes a little taller), and Instagram TV (1080x1920, a vertical video). There is no easy way of creating one edit then exporting once for each platform, each platform requires it's own specific edit. This isn't an issue for me because I love video editing so much, but for others it can be a hassle.
This is my submission to become Khalid Al Ameri's videographer. This film went from idea - script - shot - edit - upload in 2 hours. If I had more time I would have made it a lot more epic, but I wanted to just ship it as soon as possible before the deadline is over.
Here is a short documentary I made about a dear friend, Tommy Kellam. Tommy is the community outreach manager for Humble Beginnings.
This is part of a series of videos intended to shed light on the amazing work Black Muslims do for their communities and their country.
Here is a video I made earlier this year about the non profit that Tommy works for. This video was used at their annual fundraiser to show donors the kind of work the organization does.
This video went from an idea to final export in 3 hours for a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to build a Qur'an social networking site. I usually like being behind the camera, not in front of it, so please don't judge me :)
Our struggles are one and it's going to take all of us working together, across communities, to overcome the fear and divisiveness that we're facing right now. That's why, last Thursday, we brought together New Yorkers of various faiths and backgrounds to break bread and build solidarity in a public iftar dinner, held outside of Trump Tower.
We held the event as a rebuke of the Trump administration's anti-Muslim White Nationalist agenda, but more importantly—we held it to renew our commitment to being connected to one another. We were honored to be joined by New Yorkers of many different backgrounds, to show that even in the face of hate, we stand strong in defense of our values of unity, compassion, and love.
A film I made for a dear friend, Brother Akbar Mcentyre. Akbar started a nonprofit named "Humble Beginnings", that aims to better Paterson New Jersey through social work.
Brother Akbar is an inspiration. He is a selfless human who loves his community and works harder than anyone I know. He uses his personal van to help distribute food very Sunday to people less fortunate in Paterson, New Jersey.
One issue I'm very passionate about is social justice. Here are a few videos at a few recent protests.
"I Quit Tech" is a short film about a woman who quits her job because of the lack of diversity at her company.
Featuring Paul Delarosa and Monique Dismuke. It was shot in an office space in downtown San Francisco.
This video was part of the "Power Up" campaign, which raised money for a generator for Gaza's first startup incubator: Gaza Sky Geeks.
Every startup founder and developer should have access to electricity and the internet. But in Gaza, a severe energy shortage means we only get 1-6 hours of electricity from the grid. We urgently need electricity so that our companies can succeed. Empower us to fuel our own futures: contribute at PowerUpGazaGeeks.com.
Gaza is one of the toughest environments in the world, with the highest measured rate of unemployment. Because the borders are closed, most industries cannot thrive. We harness the power of the internet to build companies that target external markets, creating jobs and unlocking opportunity for talented youth.
Leaders from Silicon Valley, the Middle East, Europe, and the global tech sector have joined to support Gaza's geeks. Thank you for donating to our crowdfunding campaign and spreading the word!
I had the privilege of attending a ‪#‎blacklivesmatter‬ protest against police brutality. Some thoughts:
- All lives don't matter until black lives matter. If you know someone who says or thinks "All lives matter" go talk some sense into them. This is important!
- The protest seemed unorganized and was lacking a leader. When the cops showed up, everyone was on their own. Leading a protest is hard.
- We marched in the streets and were met with a blockage of cops wearing battle ready gear. Marching towards them made the term "police state" seem that much more real.
- The cops ran towards us and started hitting people with batons in an effort to get people on the sidewalk. This in turn made some people scared, and then they fought back, they were arrested.
- There were almost as many cops as protesters...it was ridiculous. Helicopters, armed cops...the only thing that was missing were tanks.
In 2013, with the help of my good friend Atif Mahmud, we produced UnMosqued, a documentary film about the relevance of mosques in America. The film was fully funded on Kickstarter in 10 days, was covered by multiple news outlets, and had 50+ screenings all over America. The film was thought of, planned, filmed, edited, and distributed in 2013.
Here are some clips from the film. For more information, please visit the official website for the film, here.

Although a very rare breed, the American Water Spaniel has its own state-wide fan club as the State Dog of Wisconsin! A truly dual-purpose dog, bred for companionship and top-notch retrieval ability, the AWS is active, muscular and medium in size. This breed’s unique coat can be solid liver, brown or dark chocolate and ranges from marcel (uniform waves) to closely curled.
The American Water Spaniel developed primarily in the Great Lakes region of the United States in the mid 1800’s, with ancestors that include the Irish Water Spaniel and Curly-Coated Retriever. They were the first breed developed in this country as an all-around hunter that could retrieve from boats. Breed enthusiasts kept the AWS out of the show ring for a short time in fear of ruining his reputation as a hunter, but the breed became recognized by the AKC in 1940.
An excellent sporting and family dog, the American Water Spaniel possesses great energy and eagerness for the hunt yet is controllable in the field. Similarly, he loves his daily exercise, but also enjoys just hanging out with his family. Friendly and eager to please, the AWS responds well to obedience training. His short coat requires regular brushing.
The American Water Spaniel was developed in the United States as an all-around hunting dog, bred to retrieve from skiff or canoes and work ground with relative ease. The American Water Spaniel is an active muscular dog, medium in size with a marcel to curly coat. Emphasis is placed on proper size and a symmetrical relationship of parts, texture of coat and color.
15 to 18 inches for either sex. Males weighing 30-45 lbs. Females weighing 25-40 lbs. Females tend to be slightly smaller than the males. There is no preference for size within the given range of either sex providing correct proportion, good substance and balance is maintained. Proportion–is slightly longer than tall, not too square or compact. However, exact proportion is not as important as the dog being well-balanced and sound, capable of performing the breed’s intended function. Substance –a solidly built and well-muscled dog full of strength and quality. The breed has as much substance and bone as necessary to carry the muscular structure but not so much as to appear clumsy.
The head must be in proportion to the overall dog. Moderate in length. Expression is alert, self-confident, attractive and intelligent. Medium size eyes set well apart, while slightly rounded, should not appear protruding or bulging. Lids tight, not drooping. Eye color can range from a light yellowish brown to brown, hazel or of dark tone to harmonize with coat. Disqualify yellow eyes. Yellow eyes are a bright color like that of lemon, not to be confused with the light yellowish brown. Ears set slightly above the eye line but not too high on the head, lobular, long and wide with leather extending to nose.
Skull rather broad and full, stop moderately defined, but not too pronounced. Muzzle moderate in length, square with good depth. No inclination to snipiness, The lips are clean and tight without excess skin or flews. Nose dark in color, black or dark brown. The nose sufficiently wide and with well-developed nostrils to insure good scenting power. Bite either scissor or level.
Neck round and of medium length, strong and muscular, free of throatiness, set to carry head with dignity, but arch not accentuated. Topline level or slight, straight slope from withers. Body well-developed, sturdily constructed but not too compactly coupled. Well-developed brisket extending to elbow neither too broad nor too narrow. The ribs well-sprung, but not so well-sprung that they interfere with the movement of the front assembly. The loins strong, but not having a tucked-up look. Tail is moderate in length, curved in a rocker fashion, can be carried either slightly below or above the level of the back. The tail is tapered, lively and covered with hair with moderate feathering.
Shoulders sloping, clean and muscular. Legs medium in length, straight and well-boned but not so short as to handicap for field work or so heavy as to appear clumsy. Pasterns strong with no suggestion of weakness. Toes closely grouped, webbed and well-padded. Size of feet to harmonize with size of dog. Front dewclaws are permissible.
Well-developed hips and thighs with the whole rear assembly showing strength and drive. The hock joint slightly rounded, should not be small and sharp in contour, moderately angulated. Legs from hock joint to foot pad moderate in length, strong and straight with good bone structure. Hocks parallel.
Coat can range from marcel (uniform waves) to closely curled. The amount of waves or curls can vary from one area to another on the dog. It is important to have undercoat to provide sufficient density to be of protection against weather, water or punishing cover, yet not too coarse or too soft. The throat, neck and rear of the dog well-covered with hair. The ear well-covered with hair on both sides with ear canal evident upon inspection. Forehead covered with short smooth hair and without topknot. Tail covered with hair to tip with moderate feathering. Legs have moderate feathering with waves or curls to harmonize with coat of dog. Coat may be trimmed to present a wellgroomed appearance; the ears may be shaved; but neither is required.
The American Water Spaniel moves with well-balanced reach and drive. Watching a dog move toward one, there should be no signs of elbows being out. Upon viewing the dog from the rear, one should get the impression that the hind legs, which should be well-muscled and not cowhocked, move as nearly parallel as possible, with hocks doing their full share of work and flexing well, thus giving the appearance of power and strength.
Demeanor indicates intelligence, eagerness to please and friendly. Great energy and eagerness for the hunt yet controllable in the field.

One of the few All-American breeds, the Black and Tan Coonhound is a persistent, determined, honest hunter who will stay on track no matter the terrain or conditions. His name developed from his color and purpose – his coat is coal black with tan markings, and he is used to trail and tree raccoon.
The Black and Tan Coonhound is believed to have descended from the Talbot Hound, which was known in England as far back as the 11th century, and the Bloodhound. In America, the Black and Tan Coonhound evolved from the Foxhounds that possessed treeing instinct and the black and tan color pattern. Owned by scouts and Indian fighters during the late 1700s, the Black and Tan was the first coonhound to be considered a separate breed from the American Foxhound.
Outgoing and friendly, the Black and Tan Coonhound likes to be with his family. Most are laid back in the house, but require moderate daily exercise on leash or in a fenced area. Their instincts may lead them to chase and tree small animals and bark, so training is important. Their short coat requires minimal maintenance.
The Black and Tan Coonhound is first and fundamentally a working dog, a trail and tree hound, capable of withstanding the rigors of winter, the heat of summer, and the difficult terrain over which he is called upon to work. Used principally for trailing and treeing raccoon, the Black and Tan Coonhound runs his game entirely by scent. The characteristics and courage of the Coonhound also make him proficient on the hunt for deer, bear, mountain lion and other big game. Judges are asked by the club sponsoring the breed to place great emphasis upon these facts when evaluating the merits of the dog. The general impression is that of power, agility and alertness. He immediately impresses one with his ability to cover the ground with powerful rhythmic strides.
Size measured at the shoulder–Males 25 to 27 inches; females 23 to 25 inches. Oversized dogs should not be penalized when general soundness and proportion are in favor. Penalize undersize. Proportion–Measured from the point of shoulder to the buttocks and from withers to ground the length of body is equal to or slightly greater than the height of the dog at the withers. Height is in proportion to general conformation so that dog appears neither leggy nor close to the ground. Substance–Considering their job as a hunting dog, the individual should exhibit moderate bone and good muscle tone. Males are heavier in bone and muscle tone than females.
The head is cleanly modeled. From the back of the skull to the nose the head measures from 9 to 10 inches in males and from 8 to 9 inches in females. Expression is alert, friendly and eager. The skin is devoid of folds. Nostrils well open and always black. The flews are well developed with typical hound appearance. Penalizeexcessive wrinkles. Eyes are from hazel to dark brown in color, almost round and not deeply set. Penalizeyellow or light eyes. Ears are low set and well back. They hang in graceful folds, giving the dog a majestic appearance. In length they extend naturally well beyond the tip of the nose and are set at eye level or lower.Penalize ears that do not reach the tip of the nose and are set too high on the head. Skull tends toward oval outline. Medium stop occurring midway between occiput bone and nose. Viewed from profile the line of the skull is on a practically parallel plane to the foreface or muzzle. Teeth fit evenly with scissors bite. Penalizeexcessive deviation from scissors bite.
The neck is muscular, sloping, medium length. The skin is devoid of excess dewlap. The back is level, powerful and strong. The dog possesses full, round, well sprung ribs, avoiding flatsidedness. Chest reaches at least to the elbows. The tail is strong, with base slightly below level of backline, carried free and when in action at approximately right angle to back.
Powerfully constructed shoulders. The forelegs are straight, with elbows turning neither in nor out; pasterns strong and erect. Feet are compact, with well knuckled, strongly arched toes and thick, strong pads. Penalizeflat or splayed feet.
Quarters are well boned and muscled. From hip to hock long and sinewy, hock to pad short and strong. Stifles and hocks well bent and not inclining either in or out. When standing on a level surface, the hind feet are set back from under the body and the leg from pad to hock is at right angles to the ground. Fault–Rear dewclaws.
As the name implies, the color is coal black with rich tan markings above eyes, on sides of muzzle, chest, legs and breeching, with black pencil markings on toes. Penalize lack of rich tan markings, excessive areas of tan markings, excessive black coloration. Faults–White on chest or other parts of body is highly undesirable, and a solid patch of white which extends more than one inch in any direction is a disqualification.
When viewed from the side, the stride of the Black and Tan Coonhound is easy and graceful with plenty of reach in front and drive behind. When viewed from the front the forelegs, which are in line with the width of the body, move forward in an effortless manner, but never cross. Viewed from the rear the hocks follow on a line with the forelegs, being neither too widely nor too closely spaced, and as the speed of the trot increases the feet tend to converge toward a center line or single track indicating soundness, balance and stamina. When in action, his head and tail carriage is proud and alert; the topline remains level.
Even temperament, outgoing and friendly. As a working scent hound, must be able to work in close contact with other hounds. Some may be reserved but never shy or vicious. Aggression toward people or other dogs is most undesirable.
Note–Inasmuch as this is a hunting breed, scars from honorable wounds shall not be considered faults.

On October 13, 2018, a golden heart stopped beating. John Lewis Sander, 84, of Galesville, passed away peacefully at Gundersen Health System.
John was born the only child to Lewis and Gerda (Oppegaard) Sander on August 28, 1934. He was raised on the family farm in German Coulee and later moved to the village of Ettrick. On April 2, 1954, he married the love of his life, Marilyn Blankenhorn, at French Creek Lutheran Church.
He is survived by his wife of 64 years; their children, Laurie (Kurt) Nelson, Rhonda (Mike) Flaherty, and David; seven grandchildren, Andrea (Darin) Maliszewski, Kyle Nelson, Kaitlyn (Kyle Canar, fiancé) and Mackenzie Flaherty, Madison, Hannah and Olivia Sander; two great-grandchildren, Estelle and Camden John Maliszewski; a sister-in-law, Helen (Bennett) Onsrud; a special cousin and friend, Winston Zeman; several nieces, nephews and cousins. In addition to his parents, John was preceded in death by a brother-in-law, Howard (Doris) Blankenhorn.
John drove fuel delivery truck in his early years before he became the manager of a bulk fuel oil and furnace repair business in Ettrick. He also managed John’s One Stop on Highway 53 for over 35 years. John was a compassionate businessman and always enjoyed chatting with his customers. In addition, John was active in Ettrick community organizations including Lions Club, Volunteer Fire Department, Businessmen’s Association, Ettrick Housing (serving as president for many years), Ettrick Mutual Insurance board, and Ettrick Cemetery Association board. He received several recognitions but was most proud of the Melvin Jones Award, Lion of the Year and Citizen of the Year Award. He was a life-long member of Living Hope Lutheran Church.
Twenty-four hours in a day was definitely not enough time for John. Besides his business and community commitments, his true passion was for the land and animals. For years, he farmed alongside his father, Lewis, first in Ettrick and then on the Blankenhorn family farm in Galesville. John and Marilyn took great pride in the farm and renovated it. Over the years it has become a gathering spot and hub of activity for the entire family. He enjoyed spending time with his grandchildren on the farm, passing on his love of animals.
John was loved by his wife and children, and adored by his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. His warm smile and tender heart will be missed by all.
Funeral service will be held at 11:30 am on Saturday, October 20, 2018 at Living Hope Lutheran Church in Ettrick, WI. Visitation will be on Saturday from 9:30 am until 11:30 am at the church. A gathering of friends and family will follow the service.
Returns or exchanges of new and unused products will also be accepted up to 60 days after the date of purchase.

Juan Villarino is a man in thrall to the siren song of the road. Since running away from a conventional life and career in Argentina in 2001, when he was 23, he reckons he has hitchhiked about 100,000 miles through 90 countries, or enough to circumnavigate the globe four times. For a stretch of his latest trip, through Africa, with his partner, Laura Lazzarino, he was joined by the writer Wes Enzinna. In an article that’s by turns admiring and inquiring, Enzinna reports for The New York Times Magazine on what he learned. His piece (with photographs by Brent Stirton) is one of four accounts of journeys published in a special “Voyages” issue of the magazine.
Over the past 40 years or so, in his wanderings across sub-Saharan Africa, Brian Jackman (right) reckons he has spent the best part of four years under canvas. He has become renowned for his writing on the African bush and its wildlife, and particularly for his chronicling (with the photographer Jonathan Scott) of the daily drama of life and death on the plains in The Marsh Lions and The Big Cat Diary. But he has also found inspiration closer to home. Close, indeed, to where I’m sitting as I write. I live in Stoneleigh, Surrey, and Jackman, now 82 and long resident in Dorset, lived as a boy a few streets away during the Second World War, over the road from my nearest sizeable patch of greenery, Nonsuch Park. In a new collection of his journalism, Wild About Britain (Bradt), he writes:
Nonsuch… had once been the site of a great palace built by Henry VIII and subsequently demolished to pay off the gambling debts of the Countess of Castlemaine, into whose hands it had passed the following century. But of course we knew nothing of this. Instead, enclosed by fleets of blowsy elms, its unshorn meadows were our prairies, its hawthorn hedges our African savannas. In one field a landmine had fallen, blowing a deep crater in the clay that quickly filled with rain; and nature, always swift to exploit a niche, soon transformed it into a wildlife haven…
Nonsuch was the perfect adventure playground, where I swung like Tarzan through the trees, made Robin Hood bows from young ash staves and built Apache dens among the cow parsley…
But Nonsuch wasn’t the real countryside. He discovered the latter on annual holidays to Cornwall, made possible because his father was a railwayman. Then, when the Blitz was at its height, he was sent to live on a farm near Bude:
For two years I never went to school. Instead, I fed the pigs their daily slops, hunted for hens’ eggs in the nettle beds and learned to milk the cows by hand, leaning my forehead against their warm flanks while swallows twittered in the rafters and the pail foamed white between my knees… It was, I suppose, an unhappy time for an eight-year-old, alone and far from home, but its magic haunts me still… Hardship there was, heartache and cruelty, but beauty and wonder, too, and the awakening of a love of all things wild that has stayed with me to this day.
That love is evident in every piece in Wild About Britain — whether Jackman is in search of the spirit of Laurie Lee in the Cotswolds or watching an otter in Shetland; whether he is introducing us to his favourite corner of Dorset (“a rumpled, tumbling green-gold land of secret combes and sensuously rounded plum-pudding hills”), or striving to understand the single-mindedness of one of his angler mates in pursuit of roach (“A trio of mute swans float past like icebergs in the swirling current, and my mind drifts with them.”).
Many of the pieces appeared first in The Daily Telegraph, and some of them I read before they appeared in print. They never needed editing, just breathing on. My favourite piece in the book is one that embraces two of Jackman’s greatest passions: Cornwall and peregrine falcons. You can read it here on Deskbound Traveller. Then you really ought to buy the book.
In the middle of the 19th century, six men and one woman risked their lives and reputations in the quest to find the source of the Nile. Tim Jeal tells their story in Explorers of the Nile, concluding today on Radio 4. The series, first broadcast in 2011, is also available on the BBC iPlayer.
Much of the fish on dinner tables in Europe and the United States comes from West African waters. Along the 448 miles of the coast of Senegal, as well as mechanised boats, there are some 21,000 pirogues, carvel-built plank boats constructed shell-first on a keel made of a single, scooped trunk of wood. Last September, Anna Badkhen moved from the US to Senegal to work on the pirogues and research a book. For Granta magazine, she reports on “life on the shifting tideline between plenty and nothing: the haul and cast of fishing at the time of the Anthropocene”.
Intelligent Life, the bi-monthly cultural and lifestyle magazine of The Economist, has a new editor, Emma Duncan, and is shortly to have a new title, 1843 — the year The Economist was founded. Under the last editor, Tim de Lisle, the magazine published some fine narrative travel writing, and that element of its coverage, I understand, is going to be expanded. The current (January/February) issue, still with the original title, has an excellent piece from Simon Barnes on Badlands National Park in South Dakota. On seeing the 50-mile Badlands Wall, he writes:
“There are a few – just a few – landscapes on Earth than make the first-time observer feel as if he had walked into a glass door. This is a deranged fantasy of a place: it’s as if Gaudí had cast aside all the restraint he showed when he designed the Sagrada Familia and really let himself go. Here is madness: glorious and forbidding at the same time. Both aspects are joyful things to those of us who are used to softer places and a softer life. But you can also feel the ancient desperation of all the humans and all the races who came here to travel through this land or, worse, to try and set up home in it.”
Barnes, who wrote about sports and wildlife for The Times for more than 20 years, has a new book out this week. The Sacred Combe (Bloomsbury) is about the secret, special places where we seem to find heaven and earth close together. He found his in the Luangwa Valley in Zambia.
In an extract on the website Longreads from his forthcoming book Writing Across the Landscape, the poet and painter Lawrence Ferlinghetti reports on arriving in Marrakesh knowing nothing of the place, “like a space traveller in a time warp”:
“Sometimes it is better not to know anything about a country when you visit it. Especially it is important not to know its language or languages. Thus every sound, striking the ear like a small bell or animal cry, without any associative meaning, takes on the immediate quality of poetry, the quality of pure color in painting, with the percussive effect of pure sound in a void.
“It is only as these sounds accumulate inside us that some sort of composite meaning forms itself. Until then, we are like children newly arrived on earth, with virgin timpani, each a tabula rasa upon which all has yet to be written. Herein lies the true fascination of travel, not in the confirmation or contradiction of what we have been led to expect by the perusal of history or the learning of local languages, neither by the recognition of native customs in their similarity or dissimilarity to our own, etc., etc.”
Stanley Stewart, with Palm Sunday donkey, took a three-day walk down the Erar Valley in Ethiopia for Telegraph Travel. His trek was part of a new community project in which guides and transport were provided by local villagers who, with the help of NGOs, have also built hedamos, or guesthouses.
He writes: “There are moments when Ethiopia seems to belong to an atlas of the imagination – part legend, part fairy-tale, part Old Testament book, part pulling your leg. In this land of wonders there are medieval castles of a black Camelot, monasteries among Middle Earth peaks accessible only by rope and chains, the ruined palace of the Queen of Sheba, and the original Ten Commandments in a sealed box guarded by mute monks with killer instincts.”
Anjam Sundaram, author of Stringer: A Reporter’s Journey in the Congo (Atlantic), reports for the Telegraph Magazine on how children in that ravaged country dream up a better future – in playgrounds made of aircraft graveyards.
With the short list for the 2014 RSL Ondaatje Prize due to be announced later this week, I’m publishing here an extract from the last of three books I picked from last year’s short list. This one is from Absolution, by Patrick Flanery, a literary thriller set in South Africa. It’s an ambitious work for a debut, and one in which the ambition is fully realised. Its two central characters are both writers: one renowned and coming to the end of her career; the other starting out, hoping to make his name by writing her biography. It’s a book in which the Truth and Reconciliation Commission features, and in which the truth itself is constantly just out of reach. Flanery powerfully evokes the sights, sounds and smells of South Africa, as well as the fear (see the extract) that afflicts its better-off citizens in their fortress homes.
A longer excerpt from Lindsey Hilsum’s article on Rwanda (which I recommended a few months ago when it appeared in the print version of Granta) can now be found on the magazine’s website. April 7, Memorial Day in Rwanda, marked the 20th anniversary of the genocide, a systematic attempt to exterminate the Tutsi minority. July 4, Liberation Day, celebrates the genocide’s end. Until the latter date, The New Yorker is allowing all visitors to its site to read the articles of Philip Gourevitch, who reported for the magazine on the aftermath of the slaughter and went on to write We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families, which won the National Book Critics’ Circle Award for non-fiction. They are introduced by his own commentary, telling how they came to be written and reinterpreting them in the light of subsequent events.

NEARLY every time I turn on or pick up an electronic anything, I’m sick of being told that it needs to be shut down and restarted, since something else urgently needs to be updated.
After another disastrous first date, there’s never the option to do it all again with funnier anecdotes, less alcohol and in jeans instead of shorts and thongs.
Or if I again blow my pay on the Gloucester Park harness races, never once have I been permitted to update my bets.
Consider for a moment how annoying it would be if “updating” happened in the real world as frequently as it does in the virtual one.
Shopping centres shutting for an hour, only to reopen with a slightly different colour scheme? Restaurants closing to add one additional topping? Whole highways shutting down to add nothing, apart from more invasive adverts?
Mostly it’s security, because despite what each of us might claim, there are apparently very few of us who can resist clicking on links that promise sexy singles in our area, urgent and unpaid legal bills and all kinds of miracle enhancements.
On a side note, we have to stop being asked to fill out, and promise we’ve read, legal forms that none of us, apart from the most lonely and obsessive compulsive, examine for more than a moment.
The only thing these boxes and forms do is teach everyone that it’s okay to lie on official forms. And I’m sure that will have zero ramifications, especially when it comes to our children and their respect for authority.
Speaking of families, I expect the people in my life to nag me. That is because I believe you can always fit more into the trash, that everything in the bathroom can go another week before being cleaned and keeping my clothes on the floor cuts out the middleman others call a wardrobe.
Basically, I have many flaws, and expect to be called out on them until I finally, reluctantly, change or go mad — what’s commonly known as nagging.
I bought them to make my life easier, not create more things to feel guilty about for avoiding, forgetting, and never doing.
Also, the amount of phone calls I miss or that interrupt updates, which then need to be restarted, seems to be the same as the number of phone calls I get — in total.
Having updates while I’m sleeping isn’t an option, since I seldom leave everything on and all that buzzing and beeping always wakes up someone.
Also, I have an irrational fear that one of the updates will lead to artificial intelligence and if my phone suddenly tries to attack, I want to at least be awake to defend myself, or to witness the end of days.
Maybe the solution is to restrict updates to one day a month and link them to our calendars, so they never happen when we’re using the thing. If only that were an option.
The Maldivian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a statement released today, said the Maldives had decided to withdraw from the Commonwealth.
The Government of Maldives has decided today to leave the Commonwealth. The decision to leave the Commonwealth was difficult, but inevitable.
The Maldives joined the Commonwealth in 1982 with high hopes and expectations, convinced that the organisation will be an arena for coordinating critical issues that the member States, in particular, the smallest members of the organisation face.
Since 2012, the Government of Maldives gave maximum cooperation to the Commonwealth, showed maximum transparency, and engaged with the Commonwealth at the highest levels. The Government had high hopes that such level of engagement will produce fruitful results. Regrettably, the Commonwealth has not recognised that progress and achievements that the Maldives accomplished in cultivating a culture of democracy in the country and in building and strengthening democratic institutions.
The Government of President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom has enacted a total of 110 pieces of legislations, of which, 94 legislations were directly related to the core values set out in the Commonwealth Charter. An overwhelming majority of these legislations (69 out of 94) were specifically designed to promote human rights, to strengthen democratic governance, and to reinforce the separation of powers. These achievements have resulted in strengthening the rule of law and produced tangible outcomes in strengthening democratic institutions in the country.
The Commonwealth has sought to take punitive actions against the Maldives since 2012 after the then President of Maldives resigned, and transfer of power took place as per the procedures set out in the Constitution. The Commonwealth’s decision to penalise the Maldives was unjustified especially given that the Commission of National Inquiry (CoNI), established with the help of the Commonwealth, found that the transfer of power in the Maldives was consistent with the constitutional provisions.
Since then, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) and the Commonwealth Secretariat have treated the Maldives unjustly and unfairly. The Commonwealth has sought to become an active participant in the domestic political discourse in the Maldives, which is contrary to the principles of the Charters of the UN and the Commonwealth. The CMAG and the Commonwealth Secretariat seem to be convinced that the Maldives, because of the high and favourable reputation that the country enjoys internationally, and also perhaps because it is a small State that lacks material power, would be an easy object that can be used, especially in the name of democracy promotion, to increase the organisation’s own relevance and leverage in international politics.
The Maldives reassures that its international engagement will continue both bilaterally and multilaterally.
The Commonwealth of Nations is an intergovernmental organisation of 53 member states, that were mostly territories of the former British Empire.
Member states have no legal obligation to one another, but are united by language, history, culture and their shared values of democracy, human rights, and the rule of law – values enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter.
We would like to inform You that on the 1st March 2009, an act from the 6th December 2008 (Dz. U. z 2009r. Nr 3, pos. 11)., regarding excise duty goods, enters into force in Poland.
The Council Directive 2003/96/EC of 27 October 2003, restructuring the Community framework for the taxation of energy products and electricity, is the official act that Poland finalized with the act from 6.12.2008.
falling within CN code 2905 11 00, which are not of synthetic origin, if these are intended for use as heating fuel or motor fuel;
When intended for use, offered for sale or used as motor fuel or heating fuel, energy products other than those for which a level of taxation is specified in this Directive shall be taxed according to use, at the rate for the equivalent heating fuel or motor fuel.
In addition to the taxable products listed above, any product intended for use, offered for sale or used as motor fuel, or as an additive or extender in motor fuels, shall be taxed at the rate for the equivalent motor fuel.
In addition to the taxable products listed above, any other hydrocarbon, except for peat, intended for use, offered for sale or used for heating purposes shall be taxed at the rate for the equivalent energy product.
That means all "energy products" which will not be used as motor fuel are not subjected by the excise duty.
The HPLC goods are not used as fuels and since 1 March 2009 Avantor Performance Materials Poland S.A. will not charge those products with the excise duty and will not require any additional documents to be able to sell them.
This cancels the necessity to prepare AAD (polish ADT) or SAD (polish UDT) document and the obligation for customers to sent those documents back with the signature and stamp.
The AAD and SAD documents will still be made for ethanol and leaded petrol, lead-free/unleaded petrol, gas oil, kerosene, natural gas, liquid gas (products form annex I to the Directive).

That is certainly the key reasons why eventually the so beloved and suitably provided in some of the most prominent mobile friendly system Bootstrap Glyphicons Download got a long-term position in our manner of thinking when even developing up the pretty next webpage we're about to generate.
However the things do progress and not back and with newest Bootstrap 4 the Glyphicons got left behind given that so far there are several suitable upgrades for them offering a lot higher selection in styles and appearances and the same ease of utilization. In such wise why narrow down your creativeness to merely 250 icons if you are able to have many thousands? In this degree the settler went back to appreciate the developing of a large assortments of absolutely free iconic font styles it has evoked.
In this way in order to get use of a couple of very good looking icons together with Bootstrap 4 all you desire is taking up the assortment fitting best to you plus include it in your web pages as well with its CDN link or even via saving and hosting it locally. The latest Bootstrap edition has being thought nicely function along with all of them.
For productivity causes, all icons request a base class and specific icon class. To put to work, place the following code almost everywhere. Be sure to make a space within the icon and text for suitable padding.
Icon classes can not actually be straight in integrated by using other components. They should not be employed coupled with other types of classes on the same feature. Instead, bring in a embedded
web directory, relative to the gathered CSS files. Transferring or renaming those font files means upgrading the CSS in one of three approaches :

Below is a selection of the very famous free and superb iconic font styles which may be simply utilized as Glyphicons replacements:
Font Awesome-- involving much more than 675 icons and even more are up to appear. All these as well come in 5 extra to the default size and the online site provides you with the solutions of obtaining your personalised versatile embed url. The use is quite plain-- simply just put an
feature and also apply the proper classes to it appearing from the handy Cheat Sheet they have presented over here http://fontawesome.io/icons Along with that you have the ability to pick to either incorporate the fonts selection just as js file using a couple of accessability opportunities or like a plain stylesheet.
Material Design Icons-- a library along with overly 900 icons applying the Google Fonts CDN. To utilize it you'll need to have only the url to Google's CDN
<link href = "https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons" rel = "stylesheet" > and you can also view a specified catalog of every bit of the accessible icons over here https://material.io/icons together with the code required for setting each one. The operation technique is practically the same excepting that fact only the major
class becomes selected to the span component along with its web content in fact specifies what icon will certainly get featured on your web page-- pretty much the titles of the icons themselves together with the living space switched out with underline
character. The opportunity for downloading single objects as image or else vector file is readily available too.
Typicons-- a bit smaller sized catalogue with practically 336 items which major web page is similarly the Cheet Sheet http://www.typicons.com/ the place you have the ability to get the particular icons classes from. The usage is pretty much the same-- a
with the suitable classes elected. They are however a self-hosted property-- you'll ought to get them and have on your own hosting server.
And so these are just some of the options to the Bootstrap Glyphicons List directly from the old Bootstrap 3 version that may possibly be used with Bootstrap 4. Employing them is very easy, the information-- normally huge and near the bottom line just these three selections offer just about 2k clean appealing iconic pictures that compared with the 250 Glyphicons is almost 10 times more. And so currently all that's left for us is having a peek at all of them and gathering the suitable ones-- fortunately the internet catalogues do have a helpful search feature too.

Few days ago i realized that some of my products that i use on a daily basis are almost used up, so i went on a mini haul and bought these few products, which are basically essentials. I went on a limb with these products, because i haven't used some of them before and i didn't even read any reviews, i just wen't out and bought them. I love Rimmel London products, so i figured i'd love this foundation as well. I will try to do a review of the products i haven't tried before, so it's gonna be something like a "first impression" post. I hope that they won't fail me, since i'm so excited to try 'em out. And if you're wondering why i didn't play safe and didn't buy products that i've previously used, honestly, i got kinda bored and i just felt like trying out new things - with the exception of the pressed powder and the eye shadow base.
That's it for now, i didn't plan to write anything, this post was just meant to be an update of my makeup collection and a few photos that i took of these new goodies that some of you might find helpful if you want to try something new but you have no idea what it is that you want a.k.a.

Mike Shay: If elected to the House of Delegates, I will work to preserve quality of life in south county .js">
In addition, the growing epidemic of drug addiction has jeopardized the well-being of many of our citizens.
To preserve and enhance our quality of life, we need elected officials at all levels who have the experience and influence to make a difference on these important and pressing issues.
My name is Mike Shay. I am a 35-year south county resident running for General Assembly delegate from District 30B (parts of Edgewater and Riva, the Mayo peninsula and areas south). I have successfully established several businesses and nonprofit organizations in south county and continually advocated for our communities.
I have a proven record and a vision that stands in sharp contrast to that of the incumbent, Seth Howard, whose votes have been out-of-step with the reasonable views and needs of south county residents and who has failed to adequately address the issues confronting us.
Development — In recent years, developers have proposed and created projects that have degraded wetlands, increased traffic and led to overcrowded schools.
The livelihood of local independent business owners has been threatened by proposals for large shopping malls and “big box” stores, which would place additional pressure on public services in our rural area. I have led multiple successful struggles against inappropriate development, protecting over 750 acres of environmentally-sensitive land in South County, including Franklin Point and Turtle Run. I also worked to defeat a proposal that would have increased school class size to 120 percent of capacity, which would have allowed serious overdevelopment.
Del. Howard has been absent on these issues and counterproductive on others. For example, highway projects such as the intersection improvement at Central Avenue and Loch Haven Road normally receive both county and state funding.
However, Delegate Howard’s efforts to secure state funds were feeble. The result: No state matching funds for intersections in Mayo. Delegate Howard also inexplicably joined a small group of legislators in voting against increased state funding for smart growth planning and fast-growing local school systems.
Environment — My longstanding leadership to protect south county’s waterways and wetlands has earned me the endorsement of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club.
In contrast, Delegate Howard has one of the assembly’s lowest MLCV environmental scores, due to his votes against policies to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy, protect oyster sanctuaries and bee colonies, and ban fracking.
Public health / Addiction to opioids — prescription pain killers, heroin and fentanyl — is a public health crisis that confronts many in our community. We all pay the cost in higher health care expenses for treatment programs, lower worker productivity, and increased crime.
If elected, I will advocate for additional state funding and resources to expand substance abuse treatment. On the contrary, Delegate Howard has acted against the interests of his constituents by opposing legislation that would accomplish this.
South county residents are now facing demanding challenges to the quality of life that attracted us here in the first place. We need as our representative a proven advocate with a successful record of supporting community planning, stopping inappropriate development, supporting local businesses, saving important lands for the public and a commitment to dealing with the public health problems facing us.
I ask for your vote on Nov. 6 for a sensible, reasonable, and responsible vision for south county. Thank you.

We all know how annoying the search for a canner knife that has disappeared when you need to open a jar. Even worse: a bottle of wine – and there is no corkscrew. But such difficulties arise not only among people.
Gubans are fish that have found a way out of these situations. In general, they eat small invertebrates, which do not resist, but from time to time they encounter what requires some effort on their part. The Gubans find bivalve mollusks, which they can not eat because of solid shells, but they have adapted to use stones like anvils to shatter them.
People tend to put vertebrates on the top of the hierarchy of animals. Curiously, there are a lot of smart animals with no spine. For example, now much more carefully began to study the brain of octopuses, finding out that they show great ingenuity when it is necessary to overcome difficulties.
They are so clever that in Britain they are awarded the title of honorable invertebrates, and they are under the protection of the state. Pursuing prey, octopuses use their pliable bodies to slip into narrow holes, however the soft body does not protect against predators. The problem of their vulnerability octopus decided: they dig out the coconut shell and use it as a refuge. It was noticed how they, squeezed into an empty shell, “walk” along the seabed, thus protecting themselves from attack.
It has long been known that crows are one of the smartest animals. They demonstrated a wide range of abilities, which are now being carefully studied. But to say that crows use cars?
Well, they do not drive them. However, there is evidence that the crows put nuts on the road and wait for them to pass the car, and then come back after the chopped nuts. Scientists argue whether this behavior of crows is pre-planned, but is there any point to argue after what level of intelligence these birds showed?
In severe natural conditions, good protection can become the difference that determines who to hunt and who to become prey. The killer always needs a good escape plan, and the killer beetle is no exception.
This predator is fed by ants and other small insects. He catches them, sucks the insides, and the remaining husks attach to the back and wears like armor against other predators.
The more “corpses” accumulate on the back of a killer beetle, the less likely it is that it will suffer during an attack. In a dangerous situation, the beetle is released from its “armor” and runs away to live another day. Composite armor is quite a new trick in the arsenal of mankind – and it looks like insects have bypassed this.
What can be difficult to use mirrors? Nothing – at least for us. But animals and small children, as a rule, are unable to understand what is seen in the mirror, it is their reflection, and not another person or animal.
In science, there is a “Mirror Test”, which determines the ability to feel in the mirror. Scientists conducted a study in which they checked whether elephants possess the necessary consciousness to use mirrors. To do this, they made marks on their heads. Surprisingly, when approaching the mirror, the elephants guided their trunks to the mark on the head, and not to their reflection.
We already know how the Guban fish smash the shells of the rocks to get to the prey inside. The otters have an advantage in the form of working limbs, so they can carry the stones with them. On the seabed, they are looking for stones of certain sizes and shapes, which speaks of the developed imagination of these animals. Then they wear them under their armpits.
As soon as the otter catches the mollusk, it breaks the shell like a hammer with a hammer – and eats the contents. Otters demonstrate the ability to regulate the process of crushing the shell, depending on the shape of the stone, which they use for this purpose.
Some abilities, which we already mentioned, could be considered innate. It remains a curious question: is it possible to teach an animal to use “tools”? It seems that this is possible.
Orangutans seem strangely similar to people in many aspects, and the ability to learn is one of them. When an orang-utan is scared, he makes a whistling noise to scare away the attacker. So do all the orangutans. But in some populations these animals improved their skills and learned to whistle louder. In all likelihood, this is an acquired skill, because it is observed only in certain parts of the orangutan populations.
It would seem that the diggers are on the other side of evolution. Living in colonies where only one female is allowed to breed, the rest of the colony spends time, constantly digging the earth in search of food. To facilitate their own destiny, they came up with a method that makes their work more tolerant. The diggers put into their mouth a piece of bark or plant; this helps them not to inhale dust and dirt when they dig the tunnels with their teeth.
Crowned spiders live in small holes in the desert and crawl out to grab any suitable prey that has been with them. Thus, they have a fairly limited hunting range. To increase the area in which they can detect prey, the spiders select seven to eight stones of similar size and shape and arrange them around the entrance to their lair. Most often they choose quartz. Spiders catch vibrations from stones, which allows them to attack prey beyond their usual range.
Is there something more touching than the mother’s love for her children? What could be more beautiful than a picture of how a cat catches another animal, eats its insides to use its dead body to bear its offspring? So the females are multiplying.
Fronima is a small invertebrate that lives in the sea. When the female fronima is ready to lay eggs, she catches salpa – a small gel-like organism, and eats her insides. There remains a hollow tube in which the token can transport eggs and young offspring until it is ready to live on its own.
Winter can boast the longest nights of the year, which creates ideal conditions for observing the sky in the Northern Hemisphere. Many astronomical events at this time of year can be seen without a telescope, with the naked eye.
Ursids are a small stream that produces up to 10 meteors per hour during peak on the night from Thursday 21 December, to Friday, 22 December.
Occasionally Ursids can explode with 100 meteors per hour, but this is not expected this year. However, the conditions for observation will be very favorable, since the flow reaches a peak just a few days after the new moon. Natural light pollution will be very small, which will allow eyewitnesses to see and dim meteors.
The new year 2018 will begin with a major meteor shower of Quadrantida, which will peak in the first days of 2018. Unlike many other stellar rains, the Quadrantid culmination lasts less than 24 hours. Therefore, if you miss the flow on the night of its peak, you will miss it completely.
In 2018, the quadrantide peak is expected on Wednesday, January 3, and until early Thursday morning, January 4. Eyewitnesses counted up to 100 meteors per hour during the Quadrantid climax, but this year everything may be wrong. Light contamination from an almost full moon will make it difficult to distinguish between dim meteors, because of which the speed of the stellar rain will be reduced to 25-50 meteors.
In January, you will see a rare astronomical event – the Blue Moon will coincide with the super moon. Both January moons will be Superlunas and will appear bigger and brighter than the usual full Moon.
The full moon on January 31 will also receive the nickname “Blue Moon”, since it is the second full moon for one calendar month.
A total lunar eclipse can be observed in East Asia, Australia, Alaska and northwest Canada. A number of regions of Asia and North America will see a partial eclipse.
This is the first time that a full lunar eclipse will occur during the Blue Moon from December 30, 1982.
Those who like to get up early will meet the parade of planets in early March. Jupiter, Mars and Saturn will line up every morning until dawn. On March 8, the Moon will be added to them, appearing between Jupiter and Mars in the southern sky.
The planet, which is most difficult to notice with the naked eye, will be visible right after sunset in mid-March. Mercury is difficult to see because of its proximity to the Sun, but on March 15 it will reach the point of maximum eastern elongation. This means that it will appear at the largest distance from the Sun and therefore will be visible after sunset.
You can see Mercury in the western part of the sky, within 75 minutes after sunset. Venus also appears in the western sky, making it easier to search for the elusive Mercury.

The East Rutherford lost one of its own in March of 2010. Loretta Gentles worked as records clerk for 38 years at our department after serving as records clerk in Carlstadt for 3 years. She passed away as a result of injuries sustained during the northeaster of March 2010.
According to Chief Minda, Loretta was a mother-like figure to each and every member of the police force. She was a lifelong resident who would go out of her way to help everyone that she came in contact with.
Loretta would be at work each and every day. Mayor Cassella recalled a day when he told only necessary workers to come in due to blizzard conditions. Chief Minda got the next call from Loretta asking if we could get her to the police station because she wanted to do her job. The Mayor stated that was the type of commitment that made Loretta who she was and East Rutherford the town that it is.

PORTLAND, Ore. --- The Portland Pilots men's and women's track and field teams will conclude their regular outdoor season competition this Saturday at the Portland Twilight at Lewis and Clark College. This meet will mark the final opportunity for student-athletes to post West Regional Qualifying times.
"This meet gets better every year and most of the events look really strong," said women's head coach Ian Solof. "This is the last meet for the majority of the team so I'm excited to see what everyone can do. Our top women are also using this as a tune-up for the NCAA First Round so it will be great prep for the championship meets coming later."
The majority of the women will compete in the 1500m in the middle of the day, while the men 1500m, 5000m, and 10,000m will feature lots of purple on the track as well. There will be athletes also competing in both the men's and women's steeplechase races, and several women in some short distance events.
Hey guys! You probably already heard from Zeldaforever, but I'm going to be on vacation for the next week without access to the website. :( I'll try to post about some stuff about my summer once I get back.
Also, I plan to be doing ALOT of art while I'm away, so maybe I can finally update that empty art page of mine that's been blank for like a year.
At the bottom is Lexi, ZeldaForever, and myself. Bunnii says I look like a horse. XD I doubt horses look that ugly.
I LOVE all these awesome pictures and I want to give credit to the incredibly talented and creative people who made them. Ya'll inspire me every day! As you know I do not own any of these so DO NOT STEAL or USE them.
I know that some of the pics might be from some fandoms I didn't know existed, so you'll just have to deal with my ignorance. I'm sorry for the ridiculously long post. I just couldn't stop finding pics I loved!
I mostly spend my days either drawing/reading or hanging out with family at home, or riding my bike to the "woods" in my neighborhood to do some archery or explore.
I love beautiful scenery like a sunset, or a moonlit night and enjoy all the wonderful things God created for us on earth.
Although I may not look like I do much, my life is very busy and I am improving myself with my many different talents, in hope to one day share them with all who visit this site.

Fighting for respect for human rights is a high-risk activity, and groups and individuals in more than 80 countries who commit themselves to this struggle are often targeted by State authorities and private groups. Human rights defenders are victims of threats, attacks, arrests, arbitrary detentions and acts of torture. Since its creation, OMCT has been a pioneer in the protection of human rights defenders by denouncing the repression to which they are subjected. In 1997, OMCT established the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders in partnership with the International Federation for Human Rights (FIDH). This unique collaboration is based on the complementary approaches of the two organisations and makes full and profitable use of their respective NGO networks. In 2007, OMCT established « Defend the defenders », a sponsorship project with Swiss personalities aiming at mobilising public opinion, the only counterweight to the arbitrary power of States.

To create this display, satellite data are obtained by the Flood Observatory, processed to detect water/land boundaries, and analyzed to produce current surface water extent in vector GIS format. These displays are updated daily. The Observatory also accepts GIS flood inundation limits from other sources and incorporates this information with permission of the authors. The date of last update is shown on each map.
Red is current surface water (flooding) where it is extending beyond the SWBD information. Twice-daily imaging (Terra-MODIS and Aqua-MODIS, at 250 m spatial resolution) of surface water is accumulated over 14 days to remove nearly all cloud obscuration. The map date refers to a two week period ending on that date.
Floods in mountainous regions are exceptionally hazardous, but they are difficult remote sensing targets and not always observable. Additionally, cloud cover or other constraints sometimes restrict the ability to capture peak inundation everywhere. The displays do not illustrate all areas of possible current flooding.
At selected locations, a time series of satellite microwave-based daily river discharge measurements are available from the Flood Observatory. See River Watch Global Display for more information.

The Berlin artist Imran Ayata and the Munich artist Bülent Kullukcu have released a compilation with SONGS OF GASTARBEITER, which is a unique declaration of love, a “respect note” to the guest workers, to the musicians among them and their songs. Sometimes Ayata and Kullukcu tour through the republic and fill the country with stories, videos and songs of guest workers. This stubborn duo has to be experienced in any case.
Imran Ayata and Bülent Kullukcu met in 2001 when the Kanaks in Berlin began to stir up high culture. With Generation Aldi on board, Bülent went to Berlin. Today, the friendship between Ayata and Kullukcu has led to the musical formation AY-KU. More volumes of Songs of Gastarbeiter are planned. But these must first be sought and found, because the migrant workers came from everywhere, “from Turkey, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Greece and Yugoslavia”, to say it in the words of Ozan Ata Canani. Let’s put aside the modesty: This music is clearly one of the best that has been produced in Germany in the last 50 years.
This music video lecture SONGS OF GASTARBEITER by Imran Ayata and Bülent Kullukcu will not be missed by anyone who is a guest worker’s child and stands by it. Children of the bourgeois household may also listen to the music with a clear conscience, especially as it contains plenty of material for aesthetic education. That’s how it is. One should therefore arrive punctually in the Migrantenstadl.

On the other hand, I believe that time itself can be ruled in films generally. You can just do everything you like. You can stretch time. Usually what film does is to tell a whole life in ninety minutes, or one week in ninety minutes.
So I thought it would be interesting, especially in Lola, to stretch time out and tell twenty minutes in one and a half hours and see what happens then. You stretch it out and suddenly you see all these little spaces in between, you can look into small channels in this stretched time period. Which allowed me to follow different lines of the story, to say „What’s this person doing by the way?“ or „What’s happening to that one?“? And then you just follow this life for a moment. I love the contradiction. You're only able to do this in movies because in real life it always has the same rhythm, a second stays a second, a minute stays a minute. We can't help it, we can't go back in time, unless we have the machine that Michael J. Fox has.
Run, Lola, Run by Tom Tykwer (1998) is a cinematically innovative film that departs in many ways from usual standards of narrative construction by using a wide range of filmmaking techniques. Although its unique graphic and audio representation as well as its plot technique confronts stereotypes that are produced by Hollywood, it can also be associated with principles of classical narrative form. In this paper I will discuss the complex structure and narrative of the movie as well as its extensive self-reflexivity by focusing on its different ramifications in art cinema, counter-cinema and classical Hollywood cinema.
In an interview on a Belgian film website David Bordwell argues that a lot of films which seem to be unusual and innovative are actually rooted in the spirit of classical cinema:
A movie like Lola Rennt for instance, which is very experimental in some ways, is in many ways also very traditional. Beginning-middle-end, she gets three chances, the last one is the right one, she looks at the audience in the end and acknowledges it's all been a game... I mean, this is very much in the spirit of classical cinema.[2]
Although this might be true, there certainly are devices in the film that can be aligned with art cinema. The categorization and analysis of Run, Lola, Run is a matter of how you define classical Hollywood cinema and of how much emphasis you put on the different characteristics that define the structure and the narrative of the film.
I want to start by using David Bordwell’s Art Cinema as a Mode of Film Practice to discuss how we might see Run, Lola, Run as an art film. The most obvious departure of Run, Lola, Run from traditional cinematic narration is the triple repetition of a single sequence of events. Thus, its overall narrative function does not proceed along a line parallel to the narrative stream. The beginning scenes of the movie contain several devices of art cinema. The pre credit sequence and the credit sequence establish a kind of “philosophical framework” that is separated from the actual narrative which means that there is no direct cause-effect linkage of the introductory scenes and the first episode. Furthermore, the establishing scene starting from a bird’s eye perspective of the city of Berlin positions the viewer directly into the main plot of the film without giving us any background information about the characters or the setting. Thus, already at the beginning of the movie Tykwer establishes a narrative which deconstructs cinematic space and time and at the same time challenges classical Hollywood cause-effect logic.
According to Bordwell, one principle that constitutes art cinema is its realism. As a matter of fact, Tom Tykwer stated that he “simply wanted a film that solidly supports reality.” With the small exception of the animated sequences Run, Lola, Run portrays a highly realistic subject matter with a real location and real characters. The impression of reality emerges from the fact that the real or actual time of each episode (about 23 minutes) is almost the same time that Lola has to save Manni. Thus, the notion of realism emerges to a lesser extent from the subjectivity of a character and its psychological effects but rather from a realistic relationship between actual time and narrated time. Nevertheless Tykwer provides us with psychological insight to Lola’s character and her motivations and thoughts by a subjectification of the camera from within her mind (running scene with the song “I wish” and close up on her face). Although there are some means that shed light on the character’s inner world I wouldn’t say that it accomplishes what Bordwell calls the “cinema of psychological effects.”[3] Another aspect of art cinema as stated by Bordwell is the sudden appearance and disappearance of minor characters that do not promote the story line but yet influence the outgoing of the different episodes. On her mission to rescue Manni, Lola encounters quite a number of people that seem not to belong to the actual story line, but that influence the outgoing of the different episodes. For example, when Lola bumps into Doris, the woman with the baby stroller, Tykwer uses an intercut montage of stills presenting Doris’s subsequent fate: losing her baby to social workers and kidnapping stranger’s baby afterward. In the second episode we see Doris’s subsequent fate which is winning in the lottery and moving with her husband to a large, luxurious house. Tykwer toys with these byplays and flash-forward scenes (a means that, according to Bordwell, is never used in Classical Hollywood cinema) that do not only interrupt the story line for a short moment, but that also have a completely different visuality.
Run Lola Run (1998), directed by Tom Tykwer, is an intense, fast paced action film with a rather simplistic plot and unexpectedly deeper philosophical implications about fate, chance, time, choice, and consequence. Not a second in this movie is boring as it is as high paced as the title implies, both physically and mentally straining.
At the beginning of Run Lola Run, two quotes are shown, one about time and exploration as sort of a cyclical process and the other is a philosophical statement about what a game is. These two statements taken together give rise to idea that life is like a game, an important concept of the movie. Then the pendulum of a clock is shown swinging back and forth. The camera enters the "mouth" of the expressionistic looking clock. The concept of time in this movie is invariably important and this action of entering this strange looking clock implies that the audience is entering a place where time is different from what we experience.
Interestingly, the film treats life (or at least in the universe of the characters) as if it were a type of game. There is a reference to the rules/theory of a soccer game at the beginning. Two references to roulette, implying how some things can come about by chance. The sort of instantaneous re-spawns Lola is capable of and the cartoon cut scenes are reminiscent of video games. This idea in addition to how the movie plays out illustrates the multitude of choices one is faced and the various consequences which can result, including butterfly effects (where one choice effects the outcome of another), with some chance and probability thrown in.
Andre Bazin in the "Evolution of the Language of Cinema" postulated two distinguishable aspects in film: plastics and reality. I would argue that this film puts its faith in reality. Though Run Lola Run certainly has plastic elements, the reality in it is what really makes the movie memorable. The prime example of reality in this film are the philosophical underpinnings of this film as discussed before. It allows for deeper thought and really drives the action and gives a greater sense weight to every action and consequence in the movie. In addition, the verisimilitude of time and space in each of Lola's run (each approximately 20 minutes as expected for temporal consistency) plays out to give a more realistic feeling. The mise en scene of much of Run Lola Run also seems to be based in reality. All of the lighting seems realistic, Lola's clothing dirty with a messy room, she lacks make up, the locations are realistic, and consistent spatial distances. All in all, Run Lola Run is like a mix between reality and a video game. The video game aspect gives it a stylistic appeal, but the reality aspect is what really makes the film what it is.
Let's analyze more closely a scene from near the start of the film to greater understand the methods and concepts of this film. Just after the introduction of the film, the basic narrative of the story is constructed by a telephone conversation between the two main characters of the film Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) and to Lola (Franka Potente). As they converse, chronological flashbacks of first Lola's then Manni's memories introduce the narrative of the film.
The scene begins with a stationary establishing satellite shot of Berlin which then flies continuously through Lola's window finally focusing on Lola's ringing phone. As Lola picks up the phone, a camera flies to the phone booth where Manni is. These two initial flying shots set a sense of urgency. Manni is clearly in a panic and asks Lola why she was not there for him. Lola explains how she was not able to pick him up as her scooter was stolen when she was purchasing cigarettes, as a flashback to this action is shown in black and white on the screen. This action facilitates the film's underlying philosophical idea of chance, coincidence, and the causality which becomes more important later in the film; if Lola did not stop to get cigarettes, then the scooter would not have been stolen and the entire situation would very likely have been averted. Then, Manni talks of the process of trading the cars for diamonds and then selling the diamonds for cash which is shown in black and white as well. He tells of leaving the bag of cash on the subway in a more grainy black and white film stock. This grainy film serves to give a greater sense of realism. When Manni tells of his dire situation, his panic becomes gradually mirrored by Lola as the bag is lost and the weight of the situation becomes recognized. Then, Manni panics about the missing money and wonders where the homeless person could have traveled to by now with the money. Pictures of possible cities are flashed on the screen as Manni says them. Then Manni's gangster "boss" is shown in the punishment Manni received in the past for stealing a carton of cigarettes. Though the job Manni took is likely illegal, there is a sense of sympathy in favor of Manni knowing he is under large pressure by an overbearing boss but, also a feeling of hopelessness is present knowing that his story would not be believed and the punishment for losing such a large sum of money will be much more brutal.
This scene consists of an overlay of two different actions separated temporally. They are shown talking on the phone in color while past events are shown in black and white with a slightly quicker progression of time. The black and white aspect indicates the action is in the past while the faster time progression contributes to the important concept of the time anomaly in the movie while also portraying the racing thoughts and panic both characters have.
Initially, Lola's knowledge of the situation is on the same level as that as the viewer. Thus, naturally, Lola is more composed than Manni, which quickly changes as Manni's situation becomes clearer, presumably also acting to gradually increase the tension felt by the viewer. The presence of the deep connection and love between them both (the image of their strong love recurs several times in the film) is established to the viewer by Lola's unwavering motivation to help Manni in any way possible. Primarily close-ups are used as Lola and Manni are on the phone to capture the strong emotion in both of their faces due to the situation. The anger and fear possessed by Manni is also reflected in these camera shots. The shots of Manni on the phone are relatively intermittent and many different perspectives are used really acting to encapsulate his angry emotions. In contrast, the shots of Lola are for a longer duration and are steadier reflecting her composure. In the flashback scenes medium shots and long shots are employed as a way to better show the progression of events. The backing techno track raises the tension and carries the fast pace of the film as well as establishing the main musical genre employed throughout the film.
The mise-en-scene of the entire film is set up in this scene. Lola becomes associated primarily with the color red. Her hair is red, she has red candles, a red phone, and red posters. Manni is associated with yellow. The phone booth is yellow and has blonde hair highlights. The spatial distances are all realistic and the phone booth and room dimensions are typical. The phone booth Manni is in has a close, claustrophobic feeling, reinforcing the tension filled “tight” situation that he has found himself in, while Lola’s room is has a typical apartment size. The main characters are wearing realistic clothing for the era and the lighting is natural and realistic. Lola’s room is messy with dark with tattered blinds only letting in a small amount of light. Meanwhile, Manni is in a phone booth in the light of day. Everything is realistic and expected for a typical day in a German city. This realistic mise-en-scene Run Lola Run possesses importantly puts the viewer in the same frame of thought as the characters. This both adds tension to the scene and makes a deeper connection the viewers have with the characters about choice and consequence.
This flashback visual narrative works as a great introduction to set up the rest of the movie. It is basically the “establishing scene” for the entirety of the movie. This scene establishes the mise en scene of the film, it starts the narrative, and gives a good sense of the two main characters in the film. In addition, it sets the setting, the high tension, and the fast pace of the film. Tykwer used a large amount of editing techniques, the character’s visual and verbal emotion, realistic mise-en-scene, and backing techno music to this effect. Conclusively this flashback scene serves an incredibly important role in its ability to set the fast pace of the film while introducing the general aspects of the film.

ABSTRACT. Protected areas have a huge socio-economic significance. Therefore, they should subject to protection within an essential range in order to sustain natural capital function-restitution and should be used in a rational way. Restrictions on the ways of managing protected areas mainly concern ventures of higher intensification of management and new investments, which have to be assessed from environmental point of view.
The aim of this article is to diagnose possible modes to accomplish forms of management for protected areas, which are in accordance with legal laws. Statistical analysis will be conducted for each business activity, and the possibility to accomplish it on protected areas.
The Church of the Epiphany was built in 1904 and was located at 2116 Cadillac Boulevard at the corner of Kercheval Avenue on Detroit’s lower east side. The Church of the Epiphany was an Episcopalian Church that was built in a small house-like structure that housed less than 400 parishioners. The Church of Epiphany may have been a smaller congregation, but that didn’t stop them from lasting over 70 years as a church.
In 1974, the Church of the Epiphany was sold to another congregation called Church of the Messiah. The Church of the Messiah had a new vision for the former Church of the Epiphany. That vision was to create a church that housed both black and white parishioners praying together under one roof. This was within a few years of the infamous 1967 Detroit riots and racial tension was at an all time high. The Church of the Messiah’s idea was brilliant and it worked, but unfortunately within a few years the Church of the Messiah ended up merging with another church and moving to another location on East Grand Boulevard.
In 1994, the final congregation, Word of Life Family Church, moved into the building. Word of Life Family Church used the location until the congregation disbanded.
In 2009, Word of Life Family Church closed the historic church. Shortly after the church closed their doors, a new congregation, Church in the Light Ministries, purchased the vacant church and were going to again use the church for their congregation. Unfortunately, the Church in the Light Ministries never opened and the historic church never came back to life.
By 2010, the now over 100 year-old building was in bad condition and the foundation was sinking further into the ground. This caused the entire church to become crooked and uneven. The floors began to warp, the walls began to crack, and the ceiling began to leak. Scrappers and vandals only added insult to injury.
As of 2015, the former Church of the Epiphany is still standing…..barely. The historic church has become scrapped, vandalized, and has badly deteriorated. As work crews continue to renovate the church’s community center next door, the Epiphany Community House/John Curtis Building, there are still no current plans for the actual church itself.

Two handsome Abia state University guys die from drowning after going to swim in river with their friends. (Photos)
Two friends from Abia State University, identified as Charles Benjamin Ngozichukwuka and Kelechi Elendu have according to a source who spoke to us, lost their lives after they drowned in a river when they went swimming.
The source, revealed that the duo, went to a river to take a swim with friends where they then drowned and lost their lives.
The source further revealed how one of the friends, shared a cryptic post on his page a day before their demise – Charles Benjamin Ngozichukwuka had shared a photo with his friend and captioned it, “The beginning of the end…”
Charles Benjamin until his death, was a nursing student of the school – friends of the deceased have taken to social media pages to show sympathy and pay tribute to their friends who they still can’t believe have passed on.

What with Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un’s recent execution of his uncle Jang Sung Thaek, not to mention Dennis Rodman’s crazed basketball undiplomacy, North Korea has been in the news again. Though Jang’s execution certainly indicates political power conflicts we know little about, it also has called attention to the very unusual ways that fisheries and other businesses are managed in North Korea.
An infrared image of the Korean peninsula at night. North Korea is mostly dark. Fishing boats of other nations cluster along 200 limits (akbizmag.com).
In North Korea, an ‘army first’ policy continues to dominate economic affairs, yet the army is not funded by a central budget. Instead the military owns companies, organizations, and their banks, and funds itself from their profits. Various fisheries are among those companies. Fishing companies supply the military directly with fish to feed the very hungry soldiers, and they also produce some of the few products – like clams and crabs – that they can sell for international currency (the Chinese are the only trading partner left), and the profits go to the military.
Different government agencies own different companies, so there is conflict among the agencies for access to those companies. When Kim Jong Un inherited power two years ago, he gave control of the fish trade to his cabinet to promote the economy. Uncle Jang grabbed it, consolidated his companies, and gathered the profits for himself and his political interests.
But then a few months ago, Kim Jong Un saw some his soldiers going very hungry, and ordered the return of control of the fisheries to the military. The soldiers sent to carry out the order were met with stiff resistance by men loyal to uncle Jang, a few were killed, and the military backed off. The Supreme Leader was furious, sent in more soldiers, regained control of the fisheries, executed two of Jang’s top aides, then arrested and quickly executed uncle Jang as well.
Since the Dec 12 execution, Kim Jong Un has enthusiastically encouraged army regulars to fish on the side. And the only management strategy of fisheries that appears to exist is his exhortation for fishermen to fish ever harder to feed and fund the army.
Supreme leader Kim Jong Un inspects a storage facility for frozen squid, not long after executing his uncle Jang (independent.co.com)
In recent weeks a couple of North Korean fishing boats have drifted into South Korean waters. One had no crew or fuel. The other had a few crew and no fuel – it had drifted for a month since it left port with insufficient fuel to go very far and it got caught in winds and currents, leaving the crew to try to survive on whatever fish they could then catch. At least they were fishermen.
So Fishermen in North Korea fish for the army. Any profits go to the army. The army depends on the profits from the fisheries as well as from other companies to fund itself. Regulations on fishing do not exist, but fishermen are encouraged to fish for quotas they cannot reach, and their supervisors are expected to report when they meet their quotas. Fishing boats are small, underequipped, and access to sufficient fuel is one of many challenges. Fishing is very hard.
And it gets harder. Last week reports surfaced of another event. A couple of fishing boats, with 22 crew including some women, crossed into into South Korean waters and were picked up by a South Korean patrol boat. When questioned, the North Koreans denied they were seeking asylum, so the South Koreans sent them home overland. When they arrived, they were all shot. True? The scanty sources seem reliable, and have not yet been denied. What is true is that we think this is all too possible.
Such conflicts and deaths are collateral damage of an irrational and absurd way to manage fisheries.
The rest of us should truly appreciate our own methods of fisheries management, no matter their flaws.
Sometimes all you really want is a delightful, humongous, sauce-oozing burger to satiate your food craving. But if you’re looking for vegan or vegetarian burgers in Singapore, chances are you think there aren’t many. Well, think again! There are plenty of vegetarian and even vegan burgers in Singapore to choose from.
*We first did a version of this post (concentrating only on vegetarian burgers) a year ago, and it was highly sought after, so we know that ya all love your burgers. So, here’s an updated post with the best ones around town. And we’re not talking about hamburgers minus the patty either (10 years ago, we probably would have been). We’re talking about real burgers folks, burgers with vegetable patties, soya patties, falafel and even halloumi and paneer (Indian cottage cheese). And then there are plenty of mushroom versions around – the Portobello burger especially seems to be rampant.
This time we specially went looking for delightful vegan burgers in Singapore too, and have included them in. So next time you need a veg-burger-fix, here’s a list of the 10 best vegetarian and vegan burgers in Singapore, and then some – these are listed in no particular order.
Hans Im Glück is not just another burger joint. The burgers here are fresh, healthy and handcrafted – a far cry from the greasy, calorie rich burgers that a fast food joint would serve. For the herbivores, on offer are 7 vegetarian and 4 vegan burgers. The fairy-tale like ambience just makes the dining experience more fun.
Try the vegan Fabulhafter (S$17) – thick wheat patty coated with generous layers of avocado cream, orange-mustard sauce and herb salad – or the vegetarian Wolpertinger – a spicy patty of carrot and corn with avocado cream and aged cheddar cheese. You can opt to have the burgers in sourdough bun, multigrain bun or naked (without any bun). Also, on offer are veg sides like Beer Battered Onion Rings, Sweet Potato Fries or Krautknolle (S$6), a traditional German white cabbage salad with potato dressing. For a dining review and more info, check out Hans Im Glück: Hearty & Healthy Vegan & Vegetarian Burgers in a Fairy-Tale Ambience.
Vegetarian or not, chances are you’ve probably heard of VeganBurg. All their burgers are vegan (duh!). Made from soya beans and mushrooms, the patties here do not contain gluten, dairy or eggs. Their burgers definitely happen to be amongst the best vegan burgers in Singapore. The bestsellers include: Cracked Mayo (S$7.90) includes (egg and dairy-free) mayonnaise, GMO-free plant-protein patty, garden fresh lettuce, hand-sliced tomatoes, and artisan bun. The cracked Mayo is also onion and garlic free.
And then there is nomVnom – the vegan fast food joint. These guys serve all kinds of vegan burgers with patties ranging from soya to mushroom to potato and mixed vegetables. This is one place where you’re not going to be short on choice for vegan burgers in Sinagpore – nomVnom serves a whooping 22 vegan burgers.
In the mood for Japanese? The Otah Otah has a spicy seaweed soy patty and Japanese cucumbers, or choose the Umi Teriyaki where the seaweed soya patty is slathered with Japanese teriyaki sauce. Been craving Indian food? Go for the Dhall Fusion which has crunchy soy patty served with homemade dhall curry. Then, there’s the Kimchi Croquette for Korean food lovers and the Meatless Mexican for the Mexicano fans.
The nomVnom folks use homemade buns and all-natural ingredients like unbleached white flour, brown sugar, natural yeast, sea salt and filtered water. The burgers are too many to list here, so check out their menu here for more. Top picks: QQ Cheesy (with a mushroom stem patty and homemade cashew nut cheese) and Nom Nom (with a soya patty and tartar sauce). Yum yum!
Café Salivation was the first Western Vegetarian Café to be opened in Little India, back in 2008. They have predominantly Western and Mediterranean cuisine, with subtle Indian influences thrown in.
Vegetable Burger comes with a patty that is made with an assortment of fresh vegetables and topped with cheese.
Sweet Potato & Quinoa Burger with Blackberry Salsa has a sweet potato and quinoa patty topped with blackberry salsa and served between burger buns.
Island Black Bean Burger has a fragrant patty made of black beans and black-eyed peas, topped with a sweet and tangy fruit salsa. Innovative for sure!
All burgers, except the Paneer Burger, can be done vegan by excluding the cheese. Of these, 4 can be made without onion and garlic on request. This has to be one of the finest selection of vegetarian burgers in Singapore. Top pick – Chickpea & Brown Rice Burger. The Island Black Bean Burger is also quite good.
Another one for the vegans. The international chain, Loving Hut, serves all-vegan food, which is healthy and made from high quality ingredients. The 3 burgers on their menu are:
All-Star-Burger(S$ 14.90) has a soy patty marinated with black pepper sauce, layered with tomato and lettuce, and topped with non-dairy cheese.
Papa’s Portobello Burger (S$ 14.90) comes with a grilled, juicy, marinated portobello with mixed herbs and olive oil in a wholemeal bun.
Tandoori Flame Burger (S$ 13.90) comes with a grilled vegan patty marinated with a complete balance of spices and flavor.
Cedele offers 4 vegetarian burgers (S$8.50 each). Wait, it gets better! All 4 burgers can be made vegan upon request. There is usually a choice of breads available for the burgers, including egg-free and gluten-free options. So, if you’re vegan, ask for vegan-friendly bread.
All 4 burgers are available at their Bakery Café outlets at several locations. Do note that all vegetarian burgers might not be available at the Bakery Kitchen outlets.
The Real Food people are known for their healthy, meat-free approach to food. They make their food from scratch and with only fresh ingredients. They have 5 outlets, the Orchard Central outlet especially is a unique space – a lifestyle restaurant with books, grocery, music and just 80 seats spread across 4000 sqft.
Not all outlets serve all 4, so if you have your heart set on trying a particular one, you might want to call them before you head over. But do head over, because this is one of the best places for gourmet vegetarian burgers in town.
Beet Millet Burger has a handmade patty made from beetroot, carrots, onions, millet and potato. Stacked atop are grilled onions, tomatoes, guacamole and fresh greens.
Lentil Quinoa Coquette Burger contains a homemade patty made from roasted walnuts, mushrooms, quinoa, oregano and Himalayan lentils stacked with fresh greens, homemade tomato sauce and vegan mayo. Who says vegetarian burgers need to be boring?
Portobello Burger is vegan, with a battered Portobello mushroom seasoned with herbs and stacked with fresh greens and organic vegan mayo.
Barley and Mushroom Burger comes with a handmade patty made from organic barley, assorted mushrooms, onions and corn. The patty is stacked with melted cheddar cheese, fresh greens, tomatoes and grilled pineapple.
Hard Rock isn’t exactly known to be the most vegetarian-friendly eatery, at least in Singapore. Among the handful of veg options though is the Quinoa Burger with a house-made patty of quinoa, red onion, portabellas, eggs, cheddar cheese, pecans, barley, soy sauce, and breadcrumbs, topped with hummus, arugula, tomato and grilled red onion. The burger is served with seasoned fries. I haven’t tried this myself but if their American vegetarian counterparts are anything to go by, I bet it’s good. I still can’t get over Hard Rock’s Cauliflower Burger that I had in San Francisco months ago. Yup, it was that good!
* Edited to add – Hard Rock Café has launched a Promotional Vegetarian Menu. Among other veg items is a Spinach, Potato and Chickpea Burger with a house made patty of red skin potato, spinach, chili peppers, cilantro, chickpeas and spices, topped with arugula, tomato, cucumber and a spiced yoghurt sauce served on a toasted brioche bun with french fries.
Bergs Gourmet Burgers offers two uncommon, yet very interesting choices for the non-meat-eaters. Those looking for vegetarian burgers in Singapore, you will find them at Bergs too, which is a top-notch burger joint.
The Krakatoa (Berg S$15.5/Small S$12.5) has a tofu patty topped with cucumber, lettuce, tomato, red onion, coriander pesto, spicy satay sauce & aioli. They had me at coriander pesto, yumm!
The Good Falla (Berg S$15.5/Small S$12.5) comes with a falafel patty, which is topped with avocado, lettuce, tomato, red onion, lemon yoghurt & aioli.
The international chain might be all about chicken, but at least chickenland didn’t forget the vegetarians. Nando’s does a delicious Veggie Burger (S$ 10.90) for the herbivores. It has a crispy patty smothered in chilli jam and tangy yogurt sauce, served on a toasted Portuguese roll.
We know these are not burgers per-se but since there are patties involved, we think they deserve a place here. More so with the introduction of the new Chatpata Chickpea. In fact, Chatpata Chickpea is a limited time burger – but we love it so we hope it stays. And the best part is that this is one of the most easily available vegan burgers in Singapore, since Subway is mostly just around the corner. We checked with Subway and the ingredients in the patty are primarily vegetables (including onion & garlic) and chick peas. The patty also contains wheat and does not contain dairy/eggs – so it should be suitable for most vegans.
Their other veg staple, the good ol’ Veggie Patty has ingredients like egg, soy, carrots, corn and red peppers. As we all know, the 3rd veg option on their menu is the simple Veggie Delite™ where you choose your own veggies, condiments and sauces.
Still looking for more places to satisfy the vegetarian burger craving? These joints also have you covered. The restaurants below also serve noteworthy vegetarian burgers in Singapore, albeit, each eatery serves just the one.
At Potato Head Folks / Three Buns, you can get The Roots (S$17). It comes with seasonal vegetables, cheese fritter, coleslaw, lettuce, pickles, ‘Big Poppa Hot sauce’ & mayo in a wholemeal bun. And then there’s DOJO. These guys might specialize in pork burgers, but they do have something for the occasional vegetarian diner. Vega (S$8) contains a veg patty made from potato, carrots, champignon mushrooms and onions, and topped with a slaw. The burger contains egg though, so it isn’t suitable for vegans.
And for the times when you’re just walking around and hunger strikes, head to a Mc Donald’s nearby. Their Veggie Crunch Burger (S$3) contains a patty made with green peas, carrots, cooked rice, potato and red bell peppers.
There are also many eateries that serve one variation or the other of the mushroom burger. Seriously, the ‘shrooms seem to be everywhere. Two Blur Guys, Fat Boy’s, Burger Joint, PS.Café and (Working Title) Burger Bar all do their own version of the mushroom burger.
So get ready to be spoilt for choice! And next time, someone tells you that vegetarians and burgers don’t go together, take them to one of these places.

Contrary to what you might hear in writing classes and workshops, your narrator doesn't have to be likeable. She can be really good at telling lies and making everyone believe them. He can be deceptive, either deliberately or not. In fact, your narrator can be downright unreliable. And whether you're a fan of unreliable narrators ...

Indonesia needs in the energy sector is increasing every year, while fossil fuels are the main energy source decreases. Therefore, there should be efforts to find alternative fuels to compelte Indonesia needs in energy. Indonesia has natural resources, such as microalgae Melosira sp. which can be developed into a biofuel because the fatty acids C:16 (palmitic acid and acid palmioleat) are high. Previous research has suggested that Melosira sp has a high biomass, but low lipid levels. Lipid levels are influenced by nutrients, one of which is nitrogen. The aim of this research was to determine optimum nitrate levels for growth and lipid level ofMelosira sp. This research was conducted in the Algae laboratory of Pertamina Research and Development Pulogadung, Jakarta, in December 2015-April 2016, includes the step of cultivation, harvesting, calculating biomass, extraction and distillation. Variations in the concentration of nitrate levels in medium f/2 is 0,88 M (control), 0,58 M, 1,17 M, 1,47 M given at the stage of cultivation in the aquarium. This study uses a completely randomized design (CRD). Parameter observed: the growth curve, growth rate, biomass and lipid levels. The results showed the highest growth rate obtainedfrom the treatment with nitrate levels 1,17 M and 1,47 M. Highest biomass growth rate obtained from the treatment with nitrate levels 1,47 M. This is because the nitrate in the culture can be optimally used for the formation of biomass through photosynthesis. While the highest lipid levels obtained from the treatment with nitrate levels 0,58 M.

ART One of my most favorite things about summer is the birds. The lovely little songbirds voices carrying me throught the day and leading me into night. It changes, you can tell, if you listen. The hoot owl deep in the dark. The sketches are for fabric which will part of an amazing collaboration I am working on for my next art show in July. "Sleeping with Nature" in Telluride and part of Art & Architecture Weekend.
The only solace I can find is in planting flowers where I dare not before...Blossom was a free soul, frree to wander up to the house, sit on the porch, nap on the deck...no flowers were safe!
We did get 2 babies. Remy, my chosen little love, didn't want anything to do with me...ran away from me!
She was already a good 2 months old and didn't know me like Blossom did. So I chose 2 others because you know, a lamb will die from a broken heart if left alone...that night, one of them did indeed die. I couldn't take it...the one left over was so sweet and loved people..but there was a problem...he was now alone. I couldn't face the possibility so we made a decision to take him back - back to his friends, whose fates are unthinkable. I won't post a pic of him - too heartbreaking - cos he was indeed ADORABLE.
Everything about him made me miss Blossom even more - how "trained" she actually was, how calm and loving she was, how special and irreplaceable she was.
He is happy with his people...about 8 other bums, the gang. We visit him and are working on finding homes.
ME I have built a new website StephanieMorganRogers.com with the thought of using Milady Productions as my shop. The bones of the site will be live TODAY!. Please come and have a look! These matters take me a long time - since i'm distracted by birds and lambies and painting. :)
Hope you are all enjoying yourselves, are surrounded by things and creatures you love and love you and are doing what you love.
