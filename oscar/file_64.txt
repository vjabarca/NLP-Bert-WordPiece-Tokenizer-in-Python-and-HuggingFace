We are all constituents under one authority structure or another (postmodernism doesn't like the sound of that). Even so, there are learning grounds when it comes to any given system... in the case of the education these are:
Once we acknowledge that we are subject to a system (and we would be fools to think otherwise), we must admit that obedience or subjection to authority is a crucial lesson for members such as we are of the Establishment. [*] Therefore students learn a critical life lesson – obedience – by learning subjection to authority (docility) in the classroom. [*]
Children must be subject to authority, but they also exercise authority. They exercise authority over themselves. They are the only ones that can make themselves learn. They exercise authority by choosing if and when they learn and subsequently what they will do with their knowledge.
It will almost never be the case of ONE teacher; knowing all, teaching all, and the lot of learners subservient. Though these do exist, having earned a right to lecture through a lifetime of learning...
Authority is proper to office, without it society would cease to cohere [*]. Parents and teachers have inherent authority and therefore should be careful with it. All proper docility & obedience may be secured under two conditions:
1. Authority must operate as also under authority, as deputy (representative of a Supreme Authority – he too must do the things he ought). It must not be arbitrary (ie, regulations subject to convenience).
2. Docility requires a sense of freedom (there is a choice, to know or not to know), [*] which necessitates self-government. Each individual must choose to learn, [*] will choose how they respond to what they've learned.
Authority is not as needful for activities such handicraft, drama, poetry, dance, etc., unless to limit these (though having a place, they shouldn't receive undue attention). In other words, a student does not need to be told to do the things he is naturally inclined to learn, but must by means of authority, be brought to discover relations he might not ordinarily seek out, which though requiring effort, may prove to be sources of real satisfaction and delight.
Authority in education comes into play not in pointing one toward where one already has a tendency to go, but in helping to see where freedom is to be had, in fields one might not otherwise choose to look.
regarding children as inferior, themselves as superior beings, by not recognizing the potency of the children's minds [*]
taking for granted the children's quickness of apprehension, over-explaining and paraphrasing [*], convinced that they cannot understand a literary vocabulary.
disregarding the nature and power of attention – that it is not to be cultivated, wooed by persuasion, or pictures and illustrative objects – that it IS a very Niagra of force, [*] an appetite fed with books and knowledge.
depreciating knowledge. Failing to realize, children revel in knowledge. A child will educate him/herself [*].
“To return to our method of employing attention; it is not a casual matter, a convenient, almost miraculous way of covering the ground, of getting children to know certainly and lastingly a surprising amount; all this is to the good, but it is something more, a root principle vital to education. In this way of learning the child comes into his own, he makes use of the authority which is in him in its highest function as a self-commanding, self-compelling power. It is delightful to use any power that is in us... but to make yourself attend, make yourself know, this indeed is to come into a king – all the more satisfying to children because they are so made that they revel in knowledge.” v6 p77-78
In summary, if you've followed this line of thinking, both authority and docility play a significant role in education. We may all exercise authority, if only in discipline of ourselves AND we are all subject to authority, if only under God. On the other hand, docility is necessary to all. In this, adults and children are all equal, and there is MUCH freedom in the acquisition of knowledge; here we find ourselves in a wide room full of life and interest, where each is at liberty to engage one's self unreservedly.
[*] The teacher, or other head may not be arbitrary but must act so evidently as one under authority that the children, quick to discern, see that he too must do the things he ought; and therefore that regulations are not made for his convenience. (I am assuming that everyone entrusted with the bringing up of children recognizes the supreme Authority to Whom we are subject; without this recognition I do not see how it is possible to establish the nice relation which should exist between teacher and taught.) p74
[*] Every king and commander, every mother, elder sister, school prefect, every foreman of works and captain of games, finds that within himself which secures faithful obedience, not for the sake of his merits but because authority is proper to his office. Without this principle society would cease to cohere. p70
[*] That subservience should take the place of docility is the last calamity for nation, family or school. Docility implies equality; there is no great gulf fixed between teacher and taught; both are pursuing the same ends, engaged on, the same theme, enriched by mutual interests; and probably the quite delightful pursuit of knowledge affords the only intrinsic liberty for both teacher and taught. “He is the freeman whom the truth makes free,” and this freedom the steady pursuit and delighful aquirement of knowledge afford to us day by day. p72
[*]...once children are allowed a due share in their own education, not a benefit for us to confer but rather a provision for them to take.
[*] The sense of must should be present with children; our mistake is to act in such a way that they, only, seem to be law-compelled while their elders do as they please. p74
[*] But the principle of authority, as well as that of docility, is inherent in children and it is only as the tact and judgment of the teacher make opportunity for its free play that they are prepared for the duties of life as citizens and members of a family. p75
[*] They do choose and are happy in their work, so there is little opportunity for coercion or for deadening, hortatory talk. p75
[*] To allow repetition of a lesson is to shift the responsibility for it from the shoulders of the pupil to those of the teacher who says, in effect, – “I'll see that you know it,” so his pupils make no effort of attention. Thus the same stale stuff is repeated again and again and the children get bored and restive, ready for pranks by way of a change. p76
[*] But if they recognized that the potency of children's minds is as great or greater than that of their own, they would not conceive that spoon-feeeding was their mission... p76
[*] We depreciate children in another way. We are convinced that they cannot understand a literary vocabulary so we explain and paraphrase to our own heart's content but not to theirs. p76
[*] Another misapprehension which makes for disorder is our way of regarding attention. We believe that it is to be cultivated, nursed, coddled, wooed by persuasion, by dramatic presentation, by pictures and illustrative objects... Attention, we know, is not a 'faculty' nor a definable power of mind but is the ability to turn on every such power, to concentrate, as we say... There it is in every child in full measure, a very Niagara of force, ready to be turned on in obedience to the child's own authority and capable of infinite resistance to authority imposed from without. p76
[*] Our part is to regard attention, too, as an appetite and to feed it with the best we have in books and in all knowledge. p77
There are few who do not know the mischievous and baffling effects of inattention and forgetfulness on the part of subordinates... p78
We may not pose before children, nor pride ourselves on dutiful getting up of knowledge in order to deliver it as emanating from ourselves. p78
We are filled with compassion when we detect the lifeless hand or leg, the artificial nose or jaw, that many a man has brought home as a consequence of the War. But many of our young men and women go about more seriously maimed than these. They are devoid of intellectual interests, history and poetry are without charm for them, the scientific work of the day is only slightly interesting, their 'job' and the social amenities they can secure are all that their life has for them.
The maimed existence in which a man goes on from day to day without either nourishing or using his intellect, is causing anxiety to those interested in education, who know that after religion it is our chief concern, is, indeed, the necessary handmaid of religion. p80

Writing Simple SELECT Statements Eliminating Duplicates with DISTINCT
6 Describe numeric data types, type precedence and type conversions. Write queries using character data types. Write queries using date and time data types. Module 8: Using Built-In Functions This module introduces the use of functions that are built in to SQL Server Denali, and will discuss some common usages including data type conversion, testing for logical results and nullability. Writing Queries with Built-In Functions Using Conversion Functions Using Logical Functions Using Functions to Work with NULL Lab: Using Built-In Functions Write queries which use conversion functions Write queries which use logical functions Write queries which test for nullability Write queries with built-in scalar functions. Use conversion functions. Use logical functions. Use functions that work with NULL. Module 9: Grouping and Aggregating Data This module introduces methods for grouping data within a query, aggregating the grouped data and filtering groups with HAVING. The module is designed to help the student grasp why a SELECT clause has restrictions placed upon column naming in the GROUP BY clause as well as which columns may be listed in the SELECT clause. Using Aggregate Functions Using the GROUP BY Clause Filtering Groups with HAVING Lab: Grouping and Aggregating Data Write queries which use the GROUP BY clause Write queries which use aggregate functions Write queries which use distinct aggregate functions
7 Write queries which filter groups with the HAVING clause Write queries which summarize data using built-in aggregate functions. Use the GROUP BY clause to arrange rows into groups. Use the HAVING clause to filter out groups based on a search condition. Module 10: Using Subqueries This module will introduce the use of subqueries in various parts of a SELECT statement. It will include the use of scalar and multi-result subqueries, and the use of the IN and EXISTS operators. Writing Self-Contained Subqueries Writing Correlated Subqueries Using the EXISTS Predicate with Subqueries Lab: Using Subqueries Write queries which use self-contained subqueries Write queries which use scalar and multi-result subqueries Write queries which use correlated subqueries and EXISTS predicate Describe the uses of queries which are nested within other queries. Write self-contained subqueries which return scalar or multi-valued results. Write correlated subqueries which return scalar or multi-valued results. Use the EXISTS predicate to efficiently check for the existence of rows in a subquery. Module 11: Using Table Expressions This module introduces T-SQL expressions which return a valid relational table, typically for further use in the query. The module discusses views, derived tables, common table expressions and inline tablevalued functions. Using Derived Tables Using Common Table Expressions Using Views Using Inline Table-Valued Functions Lab: Using Table Expressions
8 Write Queries Which Use Views Write Queries Which Use Derived Tables Write Queries Which Use Common Table Expressions Write Queries Which Use Inline Table-Valued Functions Write queries which use derived tables.

Module 12: Using Set Operators This module introduces operations involving multiple sets of data. It will cover the use of the UNION, UNION ALL, APPLY, CROSS APPLY, OUTER APPLY operators as well as the EXCEPT and INTERSECTS operators. Writing Queries with the UNION Operator Using EXCEPT and INTERSECT Using APPLY Lab: Using Set Operators Write queries which use UNION set operators and UNION ALL multi-set operators Write queries which use CROSS APPLY and OUTER APPLY operators Write queries which use EXCEPT and INTERSECT operators Write queries which combine data using the UNION operator Write queries which compare sets using the INTERSECT and EXCEPT operators Write queries which manipulate rows in a table by using APPLY with the results of a derived table or function Module 13: Using Window Ranking, Offset and Aggregate Functions This module introduces window functions including ranking, aggregate and offset functions. Much of this functionality is new to SQL Server It will cover the use of T-SQL functions such as ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, NTILE, LAG, LEAD, FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE to perform calculations against a set, or window, of rows. Creating Windows with OVER
9 Exploring Window Functions Lab: Using Window Ranking, Offset and Aggregate Functions Write queries which use ranking functions Write queries which use offset functions Write queries which use window aggregate functions Describe the benefits to using window functions. Restrict window functions to rows defined in an OVER clause, including partitions and frames. Write queries which use window functions to operate on a window of rows and return ranking, aggregation and offset comparison results. Module 14: Pivoting and Grouping Sets This module discusses techniques for pivoting data in T-SQL as well to introduce the fundamentals of the GROUPING SETS clause. It will also cover the use of GROUP BY ROLLUP and GROUP BY CUBE syntax in SQL Server Writing Queries with PIVOT and UNPIVOT Working with Grouping Sets Lab: Pivoting and Grouping Sets Write queries which use the PIVOT operator Write queries which use the UNPIVOT operator Write queries which use the GROUPING SETS subclause Write queries which pivot and unpivot result sets Write queries which specify multiple groupings with grouping sets Module 15: Querying SQL Server Metadata This module introduces the use of SQL Server system objects in T-SQL queries.

INTRODUCTION TO OUT OF HOME ABUSE AND NEGLECT CASES Currently all fifty (50) states have laws requiring the reporting and investigation of cases of suspected child abuse and/or neglect. In South Carolina the Department of Social Services (DSS) is responsible for investigating reports of suspected child abuse and/or neglect. The Department of Social Services also licenses many out of home care facilities such as group and residential homes and institutions and child day care facilities; therefore the responsibility for investigating these facilities is assigned to a special unit within DSS called the Out of Home Abuse and Neglect (OHAN) unit of DSS. The SCDSS also licenses foster homes but investigation of licensed foster homes is conducted by county DSS offices not responsible for the licensing. OHAN and the county offices will follow the same procedures when investigating foster homes as for investigation of group and residential homes and child day care facilities. The following information applies to all of these investigations. -3-
4 Under state law, DSS can visit these homes or facilities to investigate reports of abuse; they can request and receive information that is important to the investigation; have other agencies and State officials cooperate with them and the court; and, if necessary, file a petition with family court for a warrant to allow an investigation to be completed. If family court issues a warrant, DSS can then interview the child, inspect the facility and obtain records that are needed for the investigation. The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) is allowed to receive and investigate reports of institutional abuse and neglect that may have occurred in any institution or foster home operated by the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) or childcare facility operated by DSS. INITIAL REPORT AND INVESTIGATION Who can report suspected cases of child abuse and neglect? Any person who believes that a child has been abused or neglected can make a report to the Department of Social Services. Some people are mandated reporters and must make a report if they suspect abuse or neglect. This group includes professionals such as teachers, counselors, and foster care providers. What constitutes abuse or neglect? Abuse can be physical, like hitting a child too hard or allowing someone else to hit a child too hard. Abuse can also refer to injuries that a child receives from excessive corporal punishment. DSS policy for foster parents and group home policy for staff does not allow the use of corporal punishment so this issue may also be a licensing matter. Abuse is not just physical it can be mental, like saying mean things to a child all the time or emotional, like criticizing or insulting a child. Having sexual contact with a child, allowing sexual contact to occur with a child or engaging in acts that place a child at substantial risk of having sexual acts performed against the child or failing to protect a child from having sexual acts performed against them is also considered abuse. In addition, abandoning a child or allowing or encouraging a child to commit delinquent acts can be considered abuse as well. Failing to provide a child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medical care, or supervision that is appropriate to the child s age and development, though financially able to do so or offered the means to do so can be neglect when the failure to provide for the child has caused or presents a substantial risk of causing physical or mental injury. -4-
5 How does an investigation start? Anyone who suspects child abuse or neglect in an out of home setting can contact the State Office OHAN intake office or the toll free Children s Helpline telephone number or a DSS county office. If DSS determines that an investigation should be conducted, DSS must start the investigation within 24 hours of receipt of the report. What happens when allegations are made against an employee of an institution or child care facility? Within 24 hours of receiving the abuse report, DSS must start the investigation. During the investigation, DSS can visit the facility to see where the reported abuse and/or neglect took place. They can privately interview the child or children that were involved in the report or any other children if they think that it is necessary. DSS may also interview employees, administrative staff and any other individuals who may have been involved in or have knowledge of the incident. They may also review any policy or procedure, documents or records related to the operation of the facility or to the reported abuse or neglect. During an investigation of allegations in an institution or child care facility, DSS may request the institution or facility take steps to insure the safety of children residing in or being cared for by the institution or facility. The appropriate officials, agencies, departments, and political subdivisions of the State must also assist and cooperate with the court and with the Department of Social Services. At any time during the investigation, DSS may also file with the family court an affidavit and a petition to request that a warrant be issued. The family court must issue the warrant if the affidavit and petition establish probable cause to believe the child is an abused or neglected child and that the investigation cannot be completed without issuance of the warrant. The warrant may authorize the department to interview the child, to inspect the premises where the child may be located or may reside, and to obtain copies of medical, school, or other records necessary for investigation of the allegations of abuse or neglect. What happens when allegations are made against a foster parent? When a report of suspected abuse or neglect is received against a foster parent, DSS notifies the subject of the report that an allegation of child maltreatment is being investigated. The notice provides information about the allegations, the Child Protective Services process, and the rights of those involved in the investigation. The name of the reporter of the allegation is not given. If the report suggests that the child is in an urgent situation, the DSS worker must attempt -5-
6 to make face to face contact with the alleged child victim within two hours of the receipt of the report in order to assess the risk and make sure that the child is safe. Exceptions to the standard requiring face to face contact within this time frame applies when a certified county Child Protective Services (CPS) worker or licensing worker is first to see the child or when the child is temporarily unavailable and a safety plan is created with an executive administrator that is not the alleged offender. In all cases, the DSS worker must initiate an investigation within 24 hours of receiving the report by attempting to make face to face contact with the child, privately interview the child, view the setting and talk to witnesses and others. To prevent a conflict of interest, investigations of foster homes are conducted by a different county than the county that licensed the home. If DSS decides that the child s health or safety is threatened by the child s continued presence in a foster home, the county CPS office assigned to investigate will coordinate with the supervisor of the county responsible for the child and the county DSS attorney to remove the child and make a change in placement or other actions that are necessary to ensure the safety of the child. The assigned county investigator will assess the situation when there is an allegation or information from the investigation reveals that the foster parents biological or adopted children may have been harmed or are at risk of harm. How is notification of appropriate agencies and individuals carried out? During an abuse or neglect investigation DSS will notify the subject(s) of the investigation. In foster homes, they will also contact the county DSS child welfare supervisor or designee in the county responsible for the child. In group homes, children s homes and institutions they will contact the facility s chief executive officer or designated administrator; and, in child care facilities, the owner or operator. In the case of a foster parent being investigated, DSS will notify the county agency that has custodial responsibility for the alleged victim by phone that an investigation has been commenced. The county worker will then notify the parents of the alleged victim by phone or in person that an investigation has been started. DSS will then follow up with a letter to the parents by the end of the next business day after receiving the abuse report. DSS will also let the DSS Foster Home Licensing or Regulatory Unit know that a foster parent is being investigated and the licensing unit will then also investigate any alleged violations of licensing regulations and take any appropriate regulatory action such as: suspend the foster parent license, revoke the license or deny renewal of the license. -6-
7 In the case of residential facilities or child care facilities, the OHAN investigator must make sure that the parents of the children that reside at the residential facility or that attend the child care facility are notified that an investigation has been started. OHAN will contact the parents by phone or in person and send a follow-up letter by the end of the next work day. In all cases the follow up letter issued by DSS shall explain the nature of the allegations, the name and phone number of the worker assigned to the case, the protective measures that have been taken to ensure the safety of the child or children, all legal actions and due process rights that exist in this particular case, and the advice that a letter will follow explaining the result of the investigation upon completion. DSS will also call law enforcement if the investigation indicates a criminal violation such as: sexual abuse/assault; child exploitation (drug or alcohol abuse or contributing to the delinquency of a minor); severe injuries requiring medical attention; or, any other allegations that meet DSS s or law enforcement s criteria. Law enforcement can investigate on any DSS case, including those involving foster parents, day care workers and group home employees and criminal charges can be filed against the person found responsible. What should I do when DSS or someone assisting DSS in the investigation calls me? When a DSS employee or someone assisting DSS in the investigation calls you at the start of an investigation, you may wonder how to act. Always remember that DSS s main job is to protect the child. You should cooperate with the investigation if you can, and present any facts you feel help explain what may have happened to the child. If law enforcement is also investigating, you should talk to a lawyer immediately. A lawyer will advise you whether or not you should provide written or oral statements to DSS or law enforcement What if DSS or some other investigating agency asks me to sign a statement about the child s abuse or neglect? You should be aware that what you sign might be used later to say you admitted abuse or neglect. For example, it might be used in a criminal case or in a proceeding to take the child away, or in a proceeding to place you on the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect. Talk to a lawyer before you sign anything. Ask for a copy of anything that you do sign. Can I request that DSS consider additional information prior to the case decision? Yes, DSS will notify you that the agency is ready to indicate the report involving you and that you have an opportunity to provide any information that you think is important to the investigation. You may want to consult an attorney during this process. The information you provide will be reviewed and considered by a child welfare program manager who is not directly involved in the investigation. This preliminary administrative review will be conducted before the end of the investigative period of 45, but no more than 60, days. -7-
8 The outcome may be that the reviewer determines that the report should be unfounded, or additional investigation is needed, or the report should be indicated. You will be notified of the outcome of the Preliminary Administrative Review as well as information about the next steps in the process. What happens after DSS finishes the investigation? DSS has forty-five (45) days to complete an investigation once they receive an abuse or neglect report. If necessary, an additional 15 days can be granted to complete the investigation if there is good cause. Once DSS makes a decision about the investigation, notification is sent to the subject of the report, in writing, within five days. The letter will include a determination fact sheet and a notice of the individual s right to appeal the decision. What are the possible outcomes of an out of home abuse or neglect investigation? When DSS investigates an abuse or neglect report they can classify their report in one of three categories: suspected, unfounded, or indicated. Suspected means that DSS has received a report alleging abuse or neglect and is currently investigating the allegations. All initial reports must be considered suspected pending investigation. A report can remain in the suspected category up to sixty (60) days, and then it must be classified as either unfounded or indicated. Unfounded means that DSS did not have any evidence or enough evidence to prove abuse or neglect, they could not complete the investigation or they received information from mandated reporters which was not investigated by the department. Information in reports classified as unfounded must be kept for at least five years. The unfounded reports/files are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) disclosure. DSS is responsible for sending a letter to the parties involved in the investigation: foster parents, daycare workers or group home staff which lets them know that the report was unfounded. The letter can be sent either by regular or certified mail. Indicated means that DSS has enough evidence to support a finding of abuse or neglect. Information in reports classified as indicated must be kept for at least seven years from the date services are terminated. The indicated reports/files are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) disclosure. State law specifies who can access information in an indicated case record. -8-
9 DSS must notify the parties involved in the investigation: foster parents, daycare workers or group home staff to let them know that the report was indicated and that they have the right to appeal this decision. The letter must be sent by certified mail which serves as documentation of when the notice is received. What is the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect? When an investigation involving an out of home situation results in a determination that, by a preponderance of evidence, the alleged perpetrator has neglected, harmed or threatened a child with harm, the report of suspected child abuse or neglect is indicated and the name of the perpetrator is immediately entered into the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect. The department must notify the individual in writing by certified mail that his/her name has been entered in the registry, of his/her right to request an appeal of the decision to enter his/her name in the registry, and of the possible ramifications regarding future employment and licensing if he/she allows his/her name to remain in the registry. How do I appeal a DSS decision regarding an out of home investigation? The person that has been determined to have abused or neglected a child has the right to appeal the decision. The request for an appeal has to be filed in writing within 30 days of receipt of the DSS s decision. If the department determines that a report of suspected child abuse or neglect is indicated the department shall provide notice of the case decision by certified mail to the person determined to have abused or neglected the child within 5 days of making the determination. The written notice must inform the person of the following: the case decision; the right to appeal the decision; that the appeal process is for the purpose of determining whether a preponderance of evidence supports the case decision that the person abused or neglected the child; the possible effect having his/her name on the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect will have on the person s employment and licensing; and that if he/she wishes to appeal, he/she must provide written notice of their intent to appeal to the DSS office at the address noted on the letter within 30 days of receipt of the notice. If a notice of appeal is not received by DSS in 30 days, the person loses the right to appeal, and the case decision stands. If the notice of the case decision is sent by regular mail or a return receipt is not requested, the letter is then presumed to have been received by the party on the fifth day following mailing (posting). The date of the postmark of the intent to appeal or the date the intent to appeal is received by DSS at the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) shall be used, whichever is earlier. -9-
10 Once OAH receives the request for an appeal or a fair hearing, a hearing will be scheduled and all parties will be sent notice of the hearing at least 30 days prior to the scheduled hearing date. Within 14 days of receiving the intent to appeal, an administrative interim review of the case determination is conducted. The interim review of investigations of foster homes will be conducted by the county director and the administrative review of other facilities will be completed by the child protective services assistant director or designee. The county or assistant director reviews the evidence and determines if there is a preponderance of evidence that the abuse and/or neglect occurred, or whether the decision will be reversed and the case unfounded. If the decision of the interim review is to uphold the indicated finding, the matter will proceed to the fair hearing. Prior to the hearing, either party may request a pre-hearing conference. If OAH upholds the indicated finding after the fair hearing, the person the finding is against may then file a petition in the family court requesting a judicial review of DSS s finding. The appeal must be made by filing a petition for review in family court within thirty days after receipt of the final decision of OAH. On judicial review, the family court judge will review the transcript from the fair hearing, the case file and the evidence. The court will then enter a judgment that either affirms OAH s decision by finding there is a preponderance of evidence that the appellant abused or neglect the child or reverses the decision. GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE INVESTIGATION AND CENTRAL REGISTRY OF CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT What should I do if I receive a notice that I am being investigated by DSS? It is very important for you to talk to your attorney. Your attorney should help you get ready for the investigation, hearings, and the possibility of being placed on the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect. What will an attorney do for me? An attorney can tell you how to proceed and help you appeal being placed on the Central Registry of Child Abuse and Neglect should that occur. You and your attorney can also talk about ways you can defend yourself during an investigation, Fair Hearing or an appeal. -10-
11 How can I help my lawyer? You should tell your lawyer everything you know about the situation so there are no surprises. What you tell your lawyer is confidential; the lawyer will not tell anyone else without your permission. When the lawyer has made an appointment with you, try to be on time and to work with them. What should I do if someone has made false allegations against me about abuse and neglect? Tell your lawyer about this. Your lawyer will advise you how to proceed in this situation. Make sure to tell your lawyer about people who can refute the false allegations. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD BE DOING DURING THE INVESTIGATION? These are other suggested behaviors and actions to take. Speak with your lawyer and get his advice prior to taking any additional action. Make sure your lawyer says it is okay to do these things: Maintain a professional attitude. Stay focused on understanding and following the procedures in place to resolve the maltreatment report. Maintain or start a log of every conversation or activity related to the investigation, including the person calling and the agency they work for. Ask for a copy of all documents such as, the complaint or report of abuse and the safety plan established for the child. Read documents carefully and ask questions about anything you do not understand. Keep track of timelines for the investigation. Provide information and documentation to the agency about the event that caused the report to be made, if your lawyer advises you that you should/can make a statement. Reach out to local foster care support groups and associations and ask for support and assistance. -11-
12 Request that the child welfare agency provide at least one contact person in the agency to provide basic information about the investigation process. Maintain the family routine; do not isolate yourself from friends and family. HOW CAN I PROTECT MYSELF FROM ALLEGATIONS? You can never fully protect yourself from allegations of abuse and neglect. However the National Foster Parent Association has the tips below for minimizing the risk of an allegation of abuse and neglect: Participate in training for foster and adoptive parents on caring for children who have been abused or neglected. Find out as much information as possible before deciding whether to take a placement, including the child s abuse history both at home and in out-of-home placements. Do not accept a referral for a child who you do not feel you can adequately parent. Ask whether a child has a history of making allegations of abuse against caregivers. Such a history does not mean the child is untruthful, but it could indicate a need for more involved treatment and more cautions being put in place in your home. Advocate and work to ensure that all of the child s needs are identified and met. Understand and follow all laws and regulations related to foster care and adoption. Have consistent family rules and expectations for the entire family. Provide a high level of supervision for a child who demonstrates inappropriateness or has a prior history of sexualized behaviors. Keep a daily log and record any unusual events, behaviors, comments, reactions before or after interaction with family members; school issues; medical, dental, or therapy appointments; and all discussions with other professionals about the child s progress and needs (including social workers, attorneys, mental health professionals, etc.). -12-
13 You should document your notes in a spiral notebook with the date on each entry, and keep it locked in a cabinet (for confidentiality reasons). Keeping a spiral notebook shows that you haven t changed any entries, whereas notes on a computer are not as credible since information could have been changed, added, or deleted. Foster parents should promptly report any unusual incident or injury to the child s agency or to the tribal worker for children eligible under the Indian child Welfare Act. Maintain good working relationships with everyone involved in the child s life. -13-

1 More Local Structure Information for Make-Model Recognition David Anthony Torres Dept. of Computer Science The University of California at San Diego La Jolla, CA 9093 Abstract An object classification technique is proposed to solve a vehicle make and model recognition task. Edges of the back end of vehicles are extracted from images. These edges are processed into line segments which contain more local structure information than interest point based characterization can encode. Object matching is performed by comparing the sets of line segments by a Hausdorff distance. The method is tested on a database of vehicle images []. 1. Introduction An object classification technique is proposed to solve a vehicle make and model recognition task (MMR). This extends the work done by Dlagnekov [1]. Current MMR is done by extracting scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) features [6] from the image of an automobile. These features are the foundations upon which recognition is performed. While interest point based feature detectors such as SIFT contribute to robust recognition systems, they focus on minute portions of an image. If an image contains discriminating global features, such as shapes or patterns, the interest point detectors are unable to assimilate them. Vehicles contain such global features by virtue of their contours. Consider the back end of car, it is plausible to suggest that MMR could be performed based on the patterns formed by the tail lights alone. In this paper we explore such an hypothesis by replacing SIFT features with features characterizing contour lines. Specifically, we take an edge map, the binary output of your favorite edge detector, then generate a set of line segments that fit the edge pixels in the map. These line segments are partially invariant to illumination changes and they contain local structure information at a scale that is not available to interest point methods. The sets of line segments are compared using a line segment Hausdorff distance developed by Gao and Leung in [3]. In general, the Hausdorff distance from a set A to a set B is defined as the maximum distance from a point in A to the nearest point in B, or, formally, max a A min b B d(a, b) where d( ) is some metric[8]. Using line segments as the basis for the Hausdorff distance calculations, Gao and Leung applied the technique to a face recognition task and achieved competitive recognition rates which remained relatively stable in light of illumination, scale, and pose changes. At the heart of this paper is the application of the line segment Hausdorff distance to this noisier make-model recognition task. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section presents the line segment generator. This explains how line segments are obtained from the edge map of an automobile image. Section 3 explains the line segment Hausdorff distance in detail. Section 4 presents results and section 5 concludes.. Line segment generator Line segment generation can be thought of as multiple instances of line fitting a plane curve. The goal of line fitting is to approximate an arbitrary curve by a sequence of line segments. In this case, the arbitrary curve is represented as a set of noisy edge pixels corresponding to the edge map of some image. An edge map is the binary output of some edge detector. One approach to fitting, known as an error tolerance approach [5], attempts to fit lines such that the perpendicular distance from the point (pixel) to the line is within some error tolerance. One can incorporate a number of minimization criteria to such algorithms. For example, one may minimize the number of line segments produced, or minimize a sum of error term. For this experiment we implement a simple error tolerant line segment generator which pays no special attention to any minimizing criteria. There is little doubt that improving the line segment generator helps the recognition process. However, the robustness of the recognition procedure should lie heavily on the performance of the line segment Hausdorff distance, and not on the accuracy of the generator. For this reason (or excuse, if you would like,) any line segment generator is accepted which produces, qualitatively speaking, visually recognizable results. The line segment generator employed is a strip based al- 1

So the line segment produced is OC. gorithm. The idea of using strips to perform line fitting was first proposed by Reumann [7]. A strip is defined by three types of lines as shown in Figure 1, the primary line and two parallel boundary lines which lie a perpendicular distance d from the primary line. The direction of the primary line is determined by the vector between the first two points in the strip OA. The line segment produced will have end points at the origin O, and at the last point that falls in the strip C. The next line segment is produced by creating another strip with origin at C. As it is currently defined, a strip extends out to infinity. If this is the case then points that should belong to other logical line segments will fall within the strip and the generator will output an erroneous line. So we must also define the end of the strip as being that position past which there exists no strip point within a parallel distance of d. See Figure 1. The following process generates all line segments for an image edge map: 1. Find the closest edge point X to the image origin [0, 0].. Produce a line segment, XC, by the strip algorithm using a strip-origin at X. 3. If the previous step fails to produce a line segment (i.e. the strip end encloses no edge points) we arbitrarily elect a new strip-origin and repeat step. Otherwise we repeat step, taking the next strip-origin at C. This is continued until no new line segments are generated. Figure shows an image of the back of an automobile, its edge map, and the line segments generated from the edge map. Figure : An image, its edge map, and the generated line segments. 3. The line segment Hausdorff distance The line segment Hausdorff distance (LHD) is a metric which measures the similarity between two sets of line segments. Its output is a non-negative real number such that values close to zero express similarity. The idea behind this work and prior work using LHD, is that one can use the LHD measure to perform object recognition by feeding it sets of line segments which represent the structure of an object s image. In this section we go through an initial description of the line segment Hausdorff distance, this captures the major steps involved in calculating the distance. Then we see how to bolster the LHD heuristically to better deal with errors that occur when the LHD is used in an object recognition task. The LHD described here is developed in [3]. Suppose we have two sets of line segments, a model M = (m 1, m,..., m n ) and input T = (t 1, t,..., tm). The LHD is built upon a vector d(m, t) which represents a distance, or similarity, between two individual line segments m and t from the sets M and T. This vector is defined as d(m, t) = d θ(m, t) d (m, t) d (m, t).
3 original line segment pair. Finally, the distance measure returned between the two lines segments is defined as the length of the vectord(m, t), d(m, t) = d θ (m, t) + d (m, t) + d (m, t). Now we can define similarity between two sets of line segments S and T, this is the line segment Hausdorff distance, Figure 3: A geometrical view of d and d. Figure 4: The three cases where d is 0. If we extend the segments m and t so they intersect, d θ (m, t) is a function of θ, the smallest intersecting angle between the two lines. Specifically, d θ (m, t) = θ /W, where the weight W is determined in a training phase of the experiment. d θ has the property that it penalizes a pair of line segments non-linearly, that is, large intersecting angles result in considerably higher (worse) scores than small angles. d (m, t) and d (m, t) are demonstrated by considering a pair of parallel line segments as depicted in Figure 3. d (m, t), the parallel distance between two segments, is the minimum distance that one must translate a segment, in the parallel direction, in order to align either the left or right end points. In Figure 3, this value would be min{l 1, l }. d (m, t), the perpendicular distance, is the distance that one must translate a segment, perpendicular to the parallel direction, to overlap the two segments. In Figure 3 this would be the value l. Of course, in general, the two line segments will not be parallel. So before calculating the values of d (m, t) and d (m, t), the shortest of the two segments is rotated about its midpoint so that both segments are parallel. The shortest segment is selected because this causes less distortion to the where LHD(M, T) = max(h(m, T), h(t, M)), 1 h(m, T) = m M m m M m min d(m, t), t T and m denotes the length of line segment m. The general definition of the LHD is complete. Now we augment the definition to help alleviate errors that may occur when we use the LHD in an object recognition task. First, we deal with the effect of broken lines due to segmentation error. In other words, a line segment m in some model set is broken, due to noise, into several smaller segments {t 1, t,...t n } in the input set. To deal with this, d (m, t) returns zero whenever the range of one line segment is completely contained in the other. Figure 4 shows the three such cases when this occurs. A benefit of calculating the LHD is that it never explicitly matches pairs of line segments. But in obviating this expensive procedure, it allows for another type of error to occur. Consider a model set of line segments M and a corresponding input set T. Say m M has no corresponding segment in T due to noise, and, some incorrect input set N by chance contains a segment that correlates better with m. Several such errors may add up so that h(m, N) gives a better score than h(m, T), even though the latter is the correct correspondence. To help curb this type of error, a mechanism is added to the LHD that heuristically tracks how many line segments will probably be correctly matched. The heuristic introduced comes to us in the form of a similarity neighborhood: a combination of a positional neighborhood N p and an angular neighborhood N a. If a test segment s intersecting angle is within N a then the segment falls within the angular neighborhood. If each of the two end points of a test segment fall within a radius of N p of the model end points, then the segment falls within the positional neighborhood. The rationale behind the similarity neighborhood is if one or more input line segments fall within the positional and angular neighborhoods of a model segment m, then m will likely be correctly matched. m is called a high confidence line. We define the confidence ratio R between a model set and test set as the ratio of high confidence lines (N hc )to the total number of lines in the model set (N total ). 3
4 R = N hc N total This new information and the existing LDH are integrated into a new Hausdorff distance measure LHD (M, T) = LHD (M, T) + (W n D n ), where W n is a weight to be determined in a training process, and D n is the number disparity defined as the average ratio of lines found outside of the similarity neighborhood of the two sets to be compared, D n = 1 R M + R T = (1 R M) + (1 R T ). R M and R T are the confidence ratios of the model and test sets, respectively. Four parameters must be tuned before LHD is used for testing. These are W, W n, N p, and N a. Simulated annealing [9] [4] is used to approximate the parameter values that lead to a global minimization of the error rate on a set of test data. 4. Results The make-model recognition task is evaluated using a database of vehicles images []. The database consists of 1103 cropped images of the back end of vehicles of various makers and models. Also available is a set of 38 query images used to test the make and model recognition algorithm. Direct comparison of a query image to each of the 1103 images in the test database is infeasible due to the computational complexity of the LHD. In order to obtain results in reasonable time the test database is dramatically reduced by selecting one image corresponding to each make-model class in the query data set. Note that the license plate portion of the images is cropped out to eliminate any noise that the region may contribute to the LHD. Table 1: Recognition Rate of LHD Recognition Rate Top3 Rate Top5 Rate The experimental results are summarized in Table 1. The LHD is able to achieve a recognition rate of 0.4. The Top3/Top5 Rate is defined as the proportion of times that the corresponding model image is found in the top 3/5 matches of the query results. Figure 5: Sample cropped images used in experiment. Table : Recognition Rate for Cropped Data Set Recognition Rate Top3 Rate Top5 Rate Another set of experiments is run in which the images are cropped so that only the bumper portion of the image is visible (Figure 5). This is done to remove any noise which may occur due to the image background or to windshield reflection and specularity. Table shows that the recognition rates are markedly better. 5. Discussion The proposed make-model recognition system achieves good recognition rates, though the performance is not nearly as good as the SIFT based system described by Dlagnekov [1]. We can attribute some of this performance difference to the computational complexity of the LHD. It takes significantly longer to obtain recognition result via LHD. As a consequence, only a limited number of images can be used as a model database which affects the overall recognition rate of the system. Also, because of computational complexity and practical time constraints, the simulated annealing step can only be run for a limited number of time steps, thus, is it difficult to say if near optimal parameter values are being estimated. The LHD was coded in this project using Matlab, so a definite speed gain is expected by implementing the algorithm in a low level language such as C/C++. Also, as Gao and Leung report [3], there is a fair amount of speed-up to be gained by implementing prefiltering techniques which are techniques that attempt to discard obvious non-matches before the costly LHD is calculated. Speed-up, which al- 4

Simulated Annealing: Theory and Applications. Kluwer Academic Publishers, New York, Conclusion A vehicle make-model recognition system is presented. In the first stage of the system, edges from images of the back end of vehicles are extracted using a standard edge detector. From the resulting edge map we extract a set of line segments using a line fitting algorithm. The line segments capture local structure information. One compares two sets of line segments using a line segment Hausdorff distance. Classification of an input set is based on a minimal Hausdorff distance between the input set and its matching class. Recognition rates for the system are up to 59.7%, which is good, though SIFT based recognition systems can obtain classification rates of 89.5% [1]. The gap in success rates is due in part to the computational complexity of the LHD which forces the experiment performed here to be far simpler and less realistic, so a straight comparison of both methods may not appropriate.

5 Overview This issue of (AFWPS) includes updated Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) trade data for the March and June quarters of In the value of wood product imports fell by 2.0 per cent and exports fell by 8.3 per cent. Updates for housing and employment data are also included. Housing rebounded, rising from around dwelling unit commencements in to around in The largest increases were in Western Australia and New South Wales. Total employment in forestry and logging and in wood product manufacturing industries decreased, from around in to around in This issue of the AFWPS includes a summary of the recently released ABARES report Illegal logging regulation: the affected community (Gupta & Hug 2013). The report analyses imports of regulated timber products and characteristics of importers, brokers, suppliers and domestic processors affected by the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act Amendment Regulation Imports of wood products Following a 4.8 per cent decline in the previous financial year, the value of wood product imports fell by a further 2 per cent to $4.1 billion in While the value of paper and paperboard imports remained unchanged at around $2 billion, the value of most other wood product imports decreased. The value of panels and miscellaneous forest products declined slightly and the value of sawnwood and other wood products fell more sharply (Figure 1). Although the value of total paper and paperboard imports remained unchanged in , significant changes were recorded for particular grades of paper. Domestic production of household and sanitary paper (tissue paper) has decreased in recent years (IndustryEdge 2013). At the same time, volume and value of tissue paper imports have increased steadily since , showing particularly large growth in ; volume increased by around 35 per cent and value by around 31 per cent in compared with This increase in tissue paper (and packaging and industrial paper) imports completely offset a decline in imports of newsprint and printing and writing (the largest paper import) grades of paper in (Figure 2).

7 Overview The value of imported pulp decreased in by nearly 6 per cent and has decreased consistently each year over the past five years. Overall, the volume of imported pulp has declined by around 32 per cent since , partly reflecting closure of paper mills in Australia that were using imported pulp (ABARES 2012). However, since the closure in 2011 of the Kimberly-Clarke Australia pulp mill in Tantanoola in South Australia, the volume of imported pulp has increased in to meet domestic paper production needs. The value of imported paper manufactures (includes other paper articles that have had some further processing) peaked at around $590 million in Since then imports have declined, decreasing by 8.3 per cent from $486 million in to $446 million in The volume and value of sawnwood imports fell by 4.1 per cent and 5.6 per cent respectively in Small increases in sawnwood imports to Australia from Lithuania, Chile and Canada were offset by declines in imports from major suppliers including New Zealand, the United States and Malaysia. The largest decrease in volume was in dressed softwood sawnwood imports. However, as these are primarily used for structural purposes, the rebound in housing construction activity in is expected to increase sawnwood consumption and may lead to an increase in imports in the next financial year. Commencement of dwelling units rose from around in to in Despite increasing over the previous five years, the volume of wood-based panel imports decreased by 6.9 per cent in This was primarily driven by lower imports from New Zealand (down by about 39 per cent), Australia s second largest source for wood-based panel imports. By contrast, panel import volumes from China (the world s largest producer and exporter of wood-based panels) increased by about 8 per cent, accounting for around 23 per cent of total panel imports to Australia in The value of imports of miscellaneous forest products, primarily sourced from China, decreased slightly by 0.9 per cent in but remains above $700 million for the second consecutive year. These products include packing cases, frames, oils and mouldings. Exports of wood products Following a 10 per cent decline in the previous financial year, exports of wood products decreased by 8.3 per cent to $2 billion in Continuing the trend from last year, the decrease in value of exports was driven primarily by a substantial reduction in woodchip exports. Declines in export value were also evident in most other major Australian wood product exports (Figure 3), particularly wood-based panels (down by about 39 per cent) and roundwood (down by about 12 per cent). In exports of paper and paperboard overtook woodchip exports to become the largest wood product export (by value) from Australia (Figure 3). ABARES 3
8 Overview FIGURE 3 Value of wood product exports, to Other Woodchips Paper and paperboard Wood-based panels Roundwood Sawnwood Recovered paper $m Note: Other includes railway sleepers, paper manufactures, pulp and miscellaneous forest products. Source: ABARES The total value of woodchip exports decreased by 16 per cent, from $729 million in to $611 million in This was primarily driven by reductions in the volume and value of hardwood woodchip exports. Over the last five years, the total value of hardwood woodchip exports has decreased by 42 per cent. In the volume of hardwood woodchip exports decreased by 8.2 per cent to 3.1 million bone dry tonnes (bdt) and average unit value fell by 7.6 per cent to $167 per bdt. Although all state-based woodchip export data became confidential in May 2013, comparing the first three quarters of the financial year with the same period in shows that hardwood woodchip export volumes declined in all states, particularly in Tasmania (down by 30 per cent) and New South Wales (down by 22 per cent). The volume and value of softwood woodchip exports also decreased in , with the average unit value falling by 14 per cent to $134 per bdt. This trend in Australian woodchip exports may reflect competitive conditions in global woodchip markets. Although demand for woodchips from China and other emerging economies has risen, driven by increased paper production overseas, hardwood plantation forests in Asia and Latin America provide an important source of hardwood woodchips and offer a competitive substitute for Australian woodchips. Exports of wood-based panels from Australia decreased in , primarily driven by reductions in exports of veneer products (down by more than 50 per cent in value terms). This may in part be due to reduced production at Ta Ann s veneer mills in Tasmania. Exports of medium density fibreboard also fell in Although the value of roundwood exports peaked in , the volume of roundwood exports reached an all-time high of 1.8 million cubic metres in From this peak, volume of roundwood exports decreased by 15.9 per cent to 1.5 million cubic metres in This decrease in volume was largely due to reduced roundwood exports to China which accounts for around 86 per cent of Australia s total roundwood export volume. 4 ABARES
9 Overview The value of paper and paperboard exports decreased marginally in , by 0.6 per cent to around $713 million. The value of paper and paperboard exports remained above $700 million for the third consecutive year following an all-time high of $747 million in In terms of value, paper and paperboard exports are now the major wood product export from Australia, accounting for around 35 per cent of total wood product export value in The slight decrease in value of paper exports was primarily driven by reduced exports of household and sanitary paper (Figure 4), reflecting reduced domestic production of this grade of paper. In the volume and value of newsprint exports more than doubled. The value of packaging paper exports also increased marginally to remain above $500 million for the third consecutive year (Figure 4).

Trade flows were also investigated to provide a greater understanding of the trade profiles of primary source countries, which will assist in developing country specific guidance for the affected community. In addition, the locations of importers and brokers in Australia were estimated using postcodes recorded in business addresses reported in Customs declaration forms, to inform potential outreach and educational programs under the illegal logging regulation. Had the regulation been in place in 2012, importers, 452 brokers and 468 domestic processors located in Australia would have been affected, as would suppliers based around the world. Around consignments, worth $5.78 billion, were imported to Australia in 2012 and met the criteria described in the regulation (Gupta & Hug 2013). ABARES 5

ATTENDANCE POLICY: Lincoln University uses the class method of teaching, which assumes that each student has something to contribute and something to gain by attending class. It further assumes that there is much more instruction absorbed in the classroom than can be tested on examinations. Therefore, students are expected to attend all regularly scheduled class meetings and should exhibit good faith in this regard. STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES STATEMENT: Lincoln University is committed to non-discrimination of students with disabilities and therefore ensures that they have equal access to higher education, programs, activities, and services in order to achieve full participation and integration into the University. In keeping with the philosophies of the mission and vision of the University, the Office of Student Support Services, through the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) Program, provides an array of support services and reasonable accommodations for students with special needs and/or disabilities as defined by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of The Services for Students with Disabilities Program seeks to promote awareness and a campus environment in which accommodating students with special needs and/or disabilities is natural extension of the University s goal. UNIVERSITY ACADEMIC INTEGRITY STATEMENT: Students are responsible for proper conduct and integrity in all of their scholastic work. They must follow a professor's instructions when completing tests, homework, and laboratory reports, and they must ask for clarification if the instructions are not clear. In general, students should not give or receive aid when taking exams, or exceed the time limitations specified by the professor. In seeking the truth, in learning to think critically, and in preparing for a life of constructive service, honesty is imperative. Honesty in the classroom and in the preparation of papers is, therefore, expected of all students. Each student has the responsibility to submit work that is uniquely his or her own. All of this work must be 3

3 Agenda Topics Importance of the WAN and the Cloud What is WAN Optimization and how does it work? Key considerations when deploying WAN optimization into the Cloud Placement Scalability Non-interoperability 3
7 Elasticity and Economic Benefits Cloud provider realizes quantities of scale Cloud provider gets large serving multiple customers Per-unit provisioning costs decrease with size Expand IT resources on demand Cloud provider provisions resources Procurement of IT resources hidden from consumer Cloud provider provides focus and expertise Focus creates superior expertise delivering IT resources Superior expertise leads to improved IT performance and efficiency 7
8 Issues with migrating to the Cloud Largely same existing physical WAN infrastructure used to access Cloud Same WAN links with bandwidth and latency Cloud data centers are potentially far away Cloud infrastructure supports many enterprises Large scale drives lower per-unit cost for data center services All employees will be remote from their data Even single-location companies will be remote from their data HQ employees previously local to servers, but not with Cloud model 8
18 Bandwidth reduction achieved through WAN optimization Beforeoptimization data volume % Data reduction on WAN Afteroptimization data volume % of overall traffic before optimization Asset DB 79GB of data was reduced to 13GB (83% reduced) 66GB of data was removed from the International links at Malaysia 18
19 WAN optimization solution components Physical Appliances Must physically deploy into infrastructure Maximize performance/cost Software/Virtual appliances Flexible; spin up as needed Does not need Software clients WAN optimization from anywhere Traffic interception options Required for scaling through load balancing Physical and virtual devices available 19
20 Key Considerations for Cloud Deployment Placement: Where to put WAN optimization devices WAN optimization is a symmetric technology (devices on both sides of WAN) Where does device go in Cloud? Scalability: Cloud infrastructures are large WAN opt must scale for Cloud infrastructures Non-interoperability: WAN optimization involves proprietary technologies Devices from Vendor A don t interoperate with Vendor B Devices placed in Cloud must match devices in enterprise Vendor selection is key consideration 20
23 What about SaaS deployments? In 2010 SaaS was 73% of Cloud market according to market analysts SaaS growth projections as high as 25% CAGR or more SaaS providers don t provide access to infrastructure Customers cannot install own appliances or software into SaaS Cloud 1000 s of SaaS providers worldwide Most don t know about WAN optimization Few are willing to deploy WAN optimization devices Not practical to expect all your SaaS providers to deploy your WAN optimization devices 23
24 Content Delivery Networks (CDN s) CDN: System of local caching servers that serve copies of frequently-accessed data to users WAN optimization available from CDN provider WAN optimization available on 90,000+servers at Points-of-Presence (POP) around the world At least one POP is local to most SaaS providers CDN provider can host server-side WAN optimization software Local WAN optimization devices peers with instances at CDN provider POP 24
26 Scalability SaaS/CDN infrastructures are HUGE Hundreds or thousands of customers Thousands of POPs Tens of thousands of servers Hundreds of thousands of end-users A WAN optimization product that cannot scale will not be deployed by your CDN or SaaS provider Not all can scale to the requirements of CDN or SaaS network infrastructures A WAN optimization product that works for your enterprise may not work in the Cloud 26
27 WAN Optimization Interoperability Interoperability requires one standard vendor across all infrastructures WAN Optimization uses proprietary technologies Vendor A devices will not interoperate with Vendor B Same vendor everywhere enterprise, Cloud, mobile Vendor selection is key consideration Must choose vendor product supported by SaaS/CDN provider SaaS/CDN provider can only use products that scale A product that works for your enterprise may not work in the SaaS/CDN infrastructure 27
29 Summary Thoughts Cloud computing allows consolidation and sharing of IT resources Similar to consolidation and sharing of power/other resources WAN optimization key to allowing Cloud computing WAN optimization increases capacity and performance of the WAN infrastructure Key issues must be addressed to deploy WAN optimization for the Cloud Placement, Scalability, and Non-interoperability 29

This discussion provides guidance for the design of pipelines. Pipelines are typically either interterminal pipelines which are cross country and connect installations, or installation pipelines which connect petroleum-oil-lubricants (POL) facilities within an installation. The primary differences are that interterminal pipelines cross public and private properties, streets, highways, railroads, and utility rights-of-way, whereas installation pipelines do not. Interterminal pipelines may be dedicated lines connecting two or more facilities or privately owned common carrier lines serving several shippers. In some cases, the shipping facility may consist of a relatively short spur which delivers the fuel to the suction side of a pumping station which is part of the main line of a larger pipeline system. Pipeline receiving and dispensing facilities are normally part of a bulk fuel storage facility.
This course is intended for mechanical and petroleum engineers, and other design and construction professionals wanting an introduction to piping and ground facility systems for petroleum fuel handling.
This course will give engineers and others an introduction to piping systems for petroleum fuel handling applications.
This is an introduction to piping systems for pipeline and ground fueling petroleum fuel handling systems.
After completion of this course you will have an understanding of equipment and methods employed in pipeline and ground fueling petroleum fuels piping systems.

There is a general trend among building owners, insurance companies and government to work towards ensuring that all private and government buildings comply with fire safety legislation, training institution South African Fire and Medical Academy (Safma) reports.
Safma director Mark Ackers says, however, that a significant improvement in oversight and enforcement is required before this can be achieved.
Nevertheless, with the number of new technologies increasing, and better and easier-to-use firefighting equipment becoming available, there is an increased opportunity to improve fire-safety awareness at all levels of private industry and government, he adds.
It is the responsibility of the building owners to comply with fire safety regulations and it is in their interest to see that a safety inspection of the premises is conducted at least once a year, Ackers says.
He points out that a large percentage of building owners still do not seek assistance from professionals to improve fire-protection and fire-prevention methods or to comply with legislation.
Fire safety is becoming a standard operating principle to make tenancy attractive. A fire safe building is an economically viable building, he argues.
“Building owners and tenants must take fire safety seriously. Many building owners are requesting inspections by their local fire department. The challenge is weighing up lost production time against the cost of increasing awareness of fire-safe environments.”
Ackers asserts that the education of landlords and building owners is essential in raising awareness of changes in safety legislation.
“Many fire departments are short-staffed or have a shortage of the appropriate skills and this hampers the turnaround times for building inspections. This has led to building owners having to rely on private fire companies to edu- cate tenants if the local departments are not available,” he states.
Further, he says insurance companies are interested in making fire-protection and fire-prevention compliance a priority but says this is not matched by the levels of interest in industrial fire-protection and fire-prevention within industry.
He urges all companies, public facilities and government institutions to ensure that their fire-prevention and fire-protection ini- tiatives are in line with regulations and to ask for assistance from public or private institutions to ensure compliance.
Safma provides fire safety training programmes for corporate clients, while also working towards raising awareness of fire safety among the general public and school children.
“Training, education and awareness are big issues. People must know the reason for fire safety on premises and know how to deal with emergencies,” he says.

When developed countries demand equal action from developing states on emissions cuts, they perpetuate the spoils of 200 years of exploitation
For decades the apartheid regime in South Africa subjected the majority of South Africans to insidious discrimination that had no basis in global morality or international law. The minority whites merely thought the black South Africans were inferior. The white South Africans did not try to exterminate their black compatriots; instead they merely ensured that blacks laboured to maintain the standards of living of the white population.
Apartheid in South Africa was one of the greatest scourges to ever confront humankind. The inhumanity of apartheid focused international attention on the struggle to end racial discrimination. International treaties emphasised governments’ commitments to end apartheid in every aspect of daily life, including sports.
The black people of South Africa were, however, the individuals and communities that were finally able to overcome apartheid, through their own blood, sweat and tears they overcame odds stacked against them by the poverty, disease and violence to which they were subjected.
A centre of their struggle was the Natal province and particularly its capital city Durban. Just short of the 25th anniversary of the defeat of apartheid in South Africa, Durban is again at the centre of a struggle against discrimination and for the humanity’s future. The Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC and COP17) and its Kyoto Protocol (CMP7) are meeting in Durban to confront a new kind of discrimination. Instead of being confined to the people of one country, the discrimination related to climate change pits about one seventh of the earth’s population against the other 85 per cent. The 15 per cent living mainly in the rich developed countries of the North seek to maintain the advantages they have gained by over 200 years of over-exploitation of our planet’s resources and atmosphere. By doing so the 15 per cent seek to subject the other 85 per cent to a future of chronic underdevelopment and in some cases poverty, disease, and unbearable environmental catastrophes.
Like the South African apartheid leaders, many of the 15 per cent who seek impose this discriminatory double standard of existence refuse to admit that they are doing anything wrong. Some, for example the UK’s international development secretary, Mr Andrew Mitchell, even boast to the Financial Times about how well the UK is treating the poorer 85 per cent by maintaining their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of national income in foreign aid to poor countries. Mitchell is silent about the fact that at the same time the UK is also failing to meet the obligations it undertook by ratifying UNFCCC in 1992, or more recently the Kyoto Protocol in 2005, or even more recently the pledges it made in December 2009 to provide new and additional funding to developing countries to help them deal with climate change.
While the British are relatively apologetic about their discriminatory treatment of the 85 per cent, other countries including the United States and Japan are less so. These two countries are among a handful of countries that have declared that they will not cut emissions unless developing countries also do so. In principle this sounds like a sound argument of treating all people equally. The problem is, however, that after two centuries of discriminatory treatment, treating developing countries the same as developed countries merely compounds the past discrimination.
Even the US Supreme Court has recognised in relation to minorities, blacks, and women that sometimes treating equally people who have been discriminated against for long periods of time merely perpetuates —or at least does not adequately address —a history of discrimination. Sometimes affirmative action is necessary. In fact, affirmative action is exactly what the legally binding UNFCCC calls for in paragraph 1 of Article 3 by which states have agreed to “protect the climate system for the benefit of present and future generations of humankind, on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.”
The article goes on to state that this means that, “the developed country Parties should take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse effect thereof.” According to the US government, this understanding about obligations is wrong. They point to the fact that while China was an insignificant contributor of greenhouse gas emissions in 1992, today it is the largest contributor. But when emissions are calculated on a per capita basis, the United States and several of its developed allies again rise significantly past the Chinese. And when the cumulative emissions of states over the past 200 years are calculated, developing countries don’t even feature on the charts, which are exclusively dominated by developed countries. To treat developed and developing countries the same would defy the logical of both an individual-based approach as well as history. It would perpetuate the discrimination that has existed over decades against the 85 per cent of the people in the world living mainly in developing countries that has been perpetrated by the 15 per cent living mainly in developed countries.
Such equal treatment of unequals also violates the international law agreed upon by 194 states that have ratified the UNFCCC —more than have ratified the Charter of the United Nations. In other words, by ignoring their legal obligation to take the lead on combating climate change, developing countries are violating international law that protects everyone, not just the 15 per cent, and in doing so they are perpetuating a harrowing legacy of discrimination. Despite this clear indication of discrimination and despite significant efforts that it have made to ensure something valuable is accomplished at COP17, the South African government has failed to address this root cause of the impasse between developed and developing countries. Having overcome its own legacy of discrimination, it was well placed to express its concern about the failure of developed states to abide by their existing legal obligations, which perpetuate a situation of discrimination.
Surprisingly, even the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Navi Pillay, herself a native of Durban and an avid anti-apartheid activist, and perhaps the person best placed to explain how discrimination can be overcome by affirmative action, shied away from coming to COP17. Her timidity might have been attributed to the vague UN Human Rights Council resolution on climate change adopted by consensus in September. During the drafting of the resolution initiated by the Philippines and Bangladesh, two countries that are already significantly adversely impacted by climate change, a proposal by Bolivia, which was widely supported by civil society, to request the high commissioner attend the Durban talks was rejected as too radical. Just days earlier the high commissioner’s deputy had asked for guidance on the office’s engagement on climate change. The ambiguous silence of the UN Human Rights Council appeared to make the office even more timid about standing up for the human rights of people affected by climate change.
Similarly, despite urgings from civil society, the World Health Organisation’s director general, Dr Margreet Fung Chan, who is standing unopposed for a second five year term at the helm of the UN’s specialised health agency, did not think it worthwhile to make states aware that tens of millions of Africans could perish due to the increased health risks brought about by climate change. She, too, will not be in Durban, preferring to send a director three levels her junior in the WHO, giving a message that the human consequences of climate change are not front and centre in negotiations on international health action.
Again, it is mainly people in vulnerable social and economic groups who will suffer from the adverse health effects of climate change —especially women and young children. Once again, discrimination rears it ugly head due to our inaction on climate change. And once again we do not appear to be up to the challenge.
Even the more precise legal obligations in the Kyoto Protocol appear to be ridiculed, instead of respected, by some states. Canada, for example, announced at the opening of the Durban climate talks that it would not accept a new commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol when the current emissions limits expire at the end of next year. In doing so, the Canadian government seemed oblivious to the obligation to agree to a new commitment as stated in Article 3, paragraph 9 of the Kyoto Protocol. This obligation at least requires that states act in good faith. Canada’s action was an unambiguous manifestation of bad faith.
When South African President Jacob Zuma addressed the Informal Ministerial Consultations on COP17 in September he warned that the leaders assembling in Durban for COP17 “need to provide leadership towards the future, not only based on self-interest, but also guided by the common good”. The discrimination that underlies the lack of effective action on climate change is in the end perhaps the greatest threat to the common good.

Seoul Mayor Park Won Soon attended the World Mayors Summit on Climate Change and the Climate Action Day event, which were held in Paris over a period of three nights and five days. The UNFCCC COP 21 (November 30 to December 11, 2015) was held to establish the New Climate Regime, which will apply to all countries in 2020 and thereafter, and reach a consensus on a new climate convention.
This time, Mayor Park served as the chair of the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI), in which over 1,200 cities and local governments from all over the world took part, and successfully led everyone in attendance to a consensus on the new climate system, which was the main goal of this year’s meeting.
The World Mayors Summit on Climate Change was held in Paris on December 4 to discuss the roles of cities in the reduction of greenhouse gases following the launch of the new climate system and how cities will implement the system. The Summit was attended by over 800 people, including notable figures such as Mayor Park Won Soon, Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, UN General Secretary Ban Ki-moon, Mr. Michael Bloomberg, who served as the UN General Secretary’s Special Envoy for Cities and Climate Change, former U.S. Vice President Al Gore, and the mayors of Chicago, Berlin, and Sydney.
Mayor Park took part in the opening session, held under the theme “City Solutions,” as a panelist, in addition to serving as co-chair emeritus. Delivering the keynote speech at the opening ceremony was French President François Hollande.
Following the opening session, the Paris City Hall Declaration, the major achievement of the Summit, was adopted by Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Eduardo Paes, Mr. Michael Bloomberg, and all other mayors present at the meeting.
At the the UNFCCC-related Climate Action Day event held on December 5 in Paris’s Le Bourget (Blue Zone), with over 1,300 people in attendance, including representatives of local governments, businesses, and civic societies and press media, Mayor Park gave a speech on the achievements made by Seoul, a leading city in climate change-related matters.
On December 6, Mayor Park presided over the meetings of the ICLEI Board of Directors and Global Executive Committee and adopted the ICLEI declaration, urging national governments to recognize the role of cities and local governments in climate change-related matters and establish long-term, specific objectives for climate mitigation and adaptation. The declaration was officially presented at an ancillary event of the ICLEI-led UNFCCC on December 7.
Before starting his official schedule in Paris, Mayor Park stopped at the Republic Square to pay homage to the victims of the terrorist attacks that occurred in the city on November 13.
Passengers on a commercial flight in Mexico were given a start when a serpent appeared in the cabin in a scene straight out of the Hollywood thriller Snakes on a Plane.
The green reptile emerged suddenly on an Aeromexico flight from Torreon in the country’s north to Mexico City on Sunday, slithering out from behind an overhead luggage compartment.
“I was reading a magazine and the passenger next to me saw it and, ‘Oh my word!’” Medina said on Monday. He estimated it was more than 3ft (about 1m) in length.
Passengers hastily unbuckled themselves to get clear of the snake before it dropped to the floor, where people trapped it between rows 5 and 6 with blankets provided by a flight attendant, Medina said.
“It was a frightening situation … but people remained calm because it didn’t get out of that space and nobody became hysterical,” Medina said. “Some people got up to see what kind of reptile it was, but nobody got carried away.”
After the pilot radioed ahead, the plane was given priority landing in Mexico City and touched down 10 minutes later. Passengers exited out the rear, and animal control workers came on board to take the stowaway into custody.
Telangana will soon start giving awards for Telugu filmy stars and technicians from early next year onwards. A committee under the chairmanship of KV Ramanachary has suggested that awards for films produced between June 2 2014 and 31 December 2015 should be given immediately and for the films produced in 2016 shall be given separately.
Awards can be given in the name of people who rendered great service to Telugu filmdom. An award can be instituted in the name of Pydi Jayaraj, the Dada Saheb Phalke Award winner from the state and can be given to an artist who is nationally popular.
Awards in the name of Kanta Rao, the golden age hero of Telugu cinema; Prabhakara Reddy for best family drama; Dasarathi for best lyric writer and Chakri for best music director can be given, the committee recommended.
The first two Quest Packs came with additional miniatures already featured in the Game System. Kellar's Keep included more Goblins, Orcs and Fimir. Return of the Witch Lord included more Skeletons, Zombies and Mummies.
Hello all! With Halloween coming quickly upon us, we put together a photo shoot to give you some fun ideas for your upcoming parties and decoration ideas. This Halloween, try a sophisticated and softly gothic look by using a black and purple color palette rather than orange and black with touches of ghostly white along with lots of silver embellishments. This is the time to pull out those cheap candles that drip all over the place for some extra effect! The more candles the better, as the sun goes down the candlelight will create a wonderfully eerie ambience.
For flowers, stick to dark purples and find whatever is in season. We moved between silvers and blacks for our containers and got this fabulous purple glassware from a local thrift store. Dig through your own stash of vases and glasses, mixing and matching your own items is a great starting point. If you feel like you need a few more pieces, head to a thrift store or two; you can always find pewter pieces, vintage goblets, candlesticks and other treasures. One element that really made this look was the use of houndstooth fabric for linen – so fabulous and unexpected!
When doing a Halloween event, there are a few essentials – candy being the most important one! We kept to our color scheme by having ghostly white candies and black licorice mixed in with black candles. Make cute paper cones for guests to scoop up candy with by simply cutting and stapling black paper into cones. For an extra pop, add glitter to the rims of the cones by simply rolling the cones first in clear glue and then in the glitter of your choice.
When it comes to drinks, there are so many creative ways to play on your theme; create a drink station with an ice chest of spooky beverages (BevMo is perfect for finding themey drinks). For your final touch, add dry ice to all your chests! For cocktails, go for something like this grape cosmos with black licorice embellishments. To add fuel to the sugar-high flames, give kids soda with black licorice for straws! We had so much fun creating these clever cards for labeling the stations. We even have them available for you to download and use at your own Halloween parties! Click here to get them.
For your final touches, skeletons, crows, jack o’ lanterns and any other themed do dads are fun to incorporate, just be sure to not overdo it. Layering is always great for adding that extra something to a party but don’t stray too far from your color scheme. If things start to feel cheesy, you might have gone overboard on the orange!
Nothing adds a little pizzazz like a pink sequined linen! You can’t go wrong when you start out with such a beautiful foundation for a table setting. We found those lovely flower graphic plates and used our own purple glass chargers that match the dessert plates. For name tags we took a que from the plates and re-created a similar graphic.
Picking up on the sparkle of the sequined linen, we grabbed some of our metallic silver containers for centerpieces. Continuing with the shine, we found fabulous jeweled candles, mirrored candle sticks, silver napkin ring, silver mercury glass votives and used our fabulous mirrored side table! With all that sparkle make sure that you let the light in! Natural light is always preferable, so set up outside or open up those windows!
The pink didn’t stop with the linen either: we used different types of flowers in varying shades of pink for our centerpieces, pink glasses, pink cupcakes and a delicious pink cocktail garnished with a fresh raspberry. To top it all off those ghost chairs take this brunch to a whole other level of chic – and they are comfortable too! Who would have guessed?
Always take a look through your own stash of goodies to see what you can add from your own personal style. Layering is just as important as the items you choose – and balanced with that is knowing when to take away certain things. Always bring an editing eye when creating a tablescape, just because you have it doesn’t mean you have to use it. Make sure that it makes sense with the story you’re telling.

Whatsapp beta version for Android has gotten a quite enhanced upgrade to its clients with inclining visiting background. The Whatsapp upgrade made on 9th September 2016 has included the few elements which resemble greater emojis, capacity to doodle, stickers, front-confronting flash and one finger Zoom highlights.
With all these new components the use of Whatsapp will make communication with more fun. Presently the clients can see the alternatives to draw and scrawl by selecting the pencil and “T” symbol individually when they take a photograph using the camera within Whatsapp. Aside from the options it also has a most loved shading palette to doodle or keep in touch with anything.
Whatsapp Android beta adds the capacity to add stickers to photographs. Presently it is also ready to include greater emojis which will unquestionably express better and have a ton of fun discussions. In a single visit, the client can ready to include or send the mixes of Small, medium and substantial emojis.
The update likewise conveys different components to Whatsapp, for example, the capacity to send various visits without a moment’s delay while sharing or sending messages. Whatsapp Beta will include the light up feature while taking a selfie which better enlightens your face in dull situations or low light conditions. The emoji mates will be a tad bit energized with the greater emojis which is really a reward to the overhaul. The client can also hold the video button to catch a video and they simply need to slide the finger here and there to zoom in and out. This component was really like the Snapchat app.
WhatsApp Android beta overhaul is accessible with rendition v2. 16. 263. The most recent upgrade aligns out the WhatsApp with the comparative messaging applications like Snapchat and Facebook delivery person which is supporting stickers and doodling prior.
We’ve known WhatsApp was going to include picture drawing and stickers for some time now (you could even turn on the alternative by introducing an outsider application if your telephone was established). Be that as it may, it was empowered for all with no hacks in 2.16.262.
After you bring a photograph with the WhatsApp camera (check the area above for the camera qualification), you will have the capacity to trim said picture like some time recently, as well as add a sticker to it, write message, and even comment on and draw on top of it.
Stickers are extremely popular now and WhatsApp isn’t reevaluating the wheel here, however it’s all well done, with heaps of stickers and content that you can resize, move, and pivot, and a full RGB range of hues for content and drawings. There’s an Undo choice as well, if you need to about-face one or a few stages.

Dog-Harmony, an education-focused nonprofit dog rescue in Santa Rosa Beach, recently announced the acquisition of its new location at 237 Market Street, and now, it’s set to host an open house on May 9 from 4 to 7 p.m. for the community to check out the new space.
“We’re thrilled about the new space, but we have a long way to go before it’s really ready for the dogs and larger events,” said Nancy Bown, founder of Dog-Harmony. “We need some major community involvement to get this location to where it needs to be.”
Complete with live music by local artist Matt Lyons, drinks from Grayton Beer Company and Shunk Gulley Oyster Bar and light bites from Townsend Catering, this event will give members of the community an opportunity to learn more about Dog-Harmony and the work it does in the area. Bown and members of the nonprofit’s board will share their vision for the space, providing local businesses and individuals an opportunity to find out how they can help.
“There are so many ways for the community to contribute to the space,” said Bown. “We need everything from modular fencing to cabinets and kennel mats, so there are plenty of options for businesses to support this project.”
Dog-Harmony isn’t your standard breed of rescue. This nonprofit focuses on keeping dogs out of shelters in the first place by creating programs to combat the top reasons and ways dogs end up being rehomed.
There will also be a number of incredible items as part of a raffle. To purchase raffle tickets in advance:

I can't seem to find the $19.99 upgrade for ecal 2. I would love to upgrade. Could you please point me in the correct direction?
Is there a tutorial for the Ecal 2 software? I haven't figured out how to use some of the new tools that come with this program. For instance what are the knife, eraser and stencil bridge for?
I bought an Eclips 2, it had ecal lite included. I'm now ready for ECAL 2. How do I get it? Do I download the upgrade or something else. Do I need an "authorization" code? Please help....thank you

LENDER PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT By and Between RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, INC., as Program Administrator and, as Participating Lender Made and entered into as of, 20 Table of Contents Page ARTICLE I DEFINITIONS
My trust in God flows out of the experience of his loving me, day in and day out, whether the day is stormy or fair, whether I’m sick or in good health, whether I’m in a state of grace or disgrace. He comes to me where I live and loves me as I am.
Now for the fun part! As you can see we used the dark blue (Newburyport Blue) for the bottom half and kept the white molding throughout to give the room strong contrast. The top of the walls are painted with a slightly warmer white (Monterey White) that still adds enough definition between the stark white molding and the wall itself.
Now that I have been seriously thinking about this room, and by seriously I mean with a tape measure and budget, I have decided that a rectangular table will not work. The room is only 10′ X 10′ so the best option is to go with a round table that can be expanded when more room is needed at the table. This will allow for much more breathing room the rest of the time, which is most of the time, when the table is not expanded.
Now let’s see how close we come to this! Step one is to find the right table. Since the table is the center of the room, literally, it’s best to build the rest of the room around it. The table that I used for these sketches is available at Restoration Hardware, but is much more than I want to spend at $1,095, AND, it is not expandable. However, I will use this table as a jumping off point to find a similar look and style at a lower price, hopefully!
Everything else is more or less a stand in for now until we get the right dining table. But at least we have a sense of direction to start building!
This entry was posted in DINING, FURNITURE, TABLES, Uncategorized, WALLS on December 13, 2013 by steve.
The dining room renovation is still in the planning stage, but I just picked up this great chandelier from Joss & Main for $157, actually a bit more once you add tax and shipping!
It is a 10-light version that measures 14″ X 17″, perfect for a small room like mine. They also have a larger 12 light version for $220 and a smaller 6 light version for $330. I am not sure why the smallest version is the most expensive though? I’ll keep you posted when it arrives and finally gets hung up.
If you REALLY like the sputnik style they also have a floor lamp ($253), desk lamp ($167), and wall sconce ($54) available as well. But to me, the chandelier is really where it’s at!
Where to start? The dark wood hutch and buffet cabinet and dark wood chairs and table (hidden under an oddly placed flower print table-cloth) make this room feel claustrophobic, or at least it makes me feel claustrophobic when IN this room. The burgundy/merlot colored curtains block out all the light while the frosted glass chandelier blares in your face. The two-tone taupe (say that real fast five times) colored walls only help to mute out the light even more.
The two bright spots in this room are the hard-wood floor and the chair rail molding along the bottom half of the walls. The wood flooring provides a nice warm color to the room while the white molding at least gives us SOME contrast.
Sadly, this is my dining room. All these mistakes took some time to coordinate. An inherited china cabinet and dining set mixed in with a chandelier that was in this home before we moved in, combined with curtains that seemed like a good idea at the time and a table cloth that looked great in the store, all came together to make this room look like doo-doo! But not for long!
Here’s a sketch of a few ideas I have so far. Obviously not all these things will be making the final cut, but it’s a start. I like to use these kind of sketches as a frame work for the design of a room. I like the two porcelain heads on the wall, but if I can’t find them, I can find something similar in size and shape which will work just as well, and the same for everything else.
The most obvious change is the brightness in the room. It doesn’t get a great deal of sunlight, but you can create light using small amounts of contrast. A dark paint color on the bottom half against a brighter creamy color on the top half suddenly opens this space right up. I’ve already wrote about the buffet cabinet in a previous post (To Display or Buffet…) so let’s talk about the chandelier.
This would probably be considered a Sputnik style chandelier, popular in the 60’s when the whole space craze took flight (cough-cough). They have since become a part of the mid-centruy modern movement and you find them in all different sizes and shapes. Usually they are fairly round and have several extensions coming out from the center like a star, or satellite, or UFO! They range in size from 18″ or so up to several feet for the big $$$ buyer.
The model above is called the Zuo 50028 Pulsar and I found it on Quill for $249. Many other websites cary this same chandelier so shop around for the best price. Amazon carries it, through a 3rd party seller, for $75 more. Even Staples carries this light, but they’re out of stock right now. If you don’t like this particular chandelier but like the Sputnik style there are a lot of options out there, and many of them are very affordable.
I am about to start redecorating my dining room soon. Currently we have a hand-me-down dining set with matching table, chairs, and china cabinet with hutch on top. The whole set has certainly seen better days, but has very much served it’s purpose. Recently I was at JC Penney and walked through their newly designed home section. If you haven’t checked it out yet, do so. Very modern and stylish, yet still very affordable, a big plus in my eyes! You wouldn’t think that a store like JC Penney, that sells $6 sweaters and $12 jeans, would have such a cool home section, but they do. Jonathan Adler, Michael Graves, Conran, and Martha Stewart (among other designer names) have even signed on for exclusive lines with Penny’s.
So the question is, do I stick with a hutch style cabinet, or do I go with just a buffet cabinet with no hutch/display shelves on top? The dining room isn’t very large, only about 10 X 12’ish. The problem with EVERY cabinet/hutch that I’ve ever seen is that they are way too large. Usually they come in two pieces and weigh about 3 tons each. It takes a team of oxen to carry the furniture in to the house. They require an entire wall dedicated to propping them up with barely any room on either side. For these reasons, and the fact that my dining room is so small, I think the buffet style cabinet alone is enough. It will open up a whole wall essentially and still give me about the same amount of storage as I would have had with the giant hutch. Granted, I will have to find other places to display some items that are currently living in my hutch, but you can always rotate them in and out of whatever ‘display’ space you end up using, weather it’s on the table or buffet top, or in another room altogether.
So, back to JC Penny. A new dining room set can cost you thousands, or hundreds depending on the quality. I say thousands before hundreds because when it comes to wood built cabinets and tables you truly do get what you pay for. Yes, I could get a complete dining room set, table chairs, cabinet, hutch for as little as $900 at some discount furniture store (I mean you Value City, more on them later). But it will be made out of pressed board with laminated wood grain, and maybe it will last for a couple years before the shelves begin to sag and the ‘wood’ begins to turn color. But if you spend your money on quality constructed items made from REAL wood and made by REAL manufacturers who know what they are doing, that set will last a lifetime, quite literally!
Here’s the buffet cabinet I am thinking of at Penney’s. It’s designed by Conran and is currently $1,275. Of course there are always coupons and credit offers that can knock this price down a few hundred bucks, not to mention the perpetual sale JC Penney’s always seems to have going on. I like the lighter oak wood veneer finish with the geometric squares along the front. This will add a great contrast to the walls behind it which will probably be painted a dark royal blue with white walls and trim above.
I’ll keep you posted on the progress as we begin to start redesigning the whole dining room. Next up, table and chairs!

Deep tissue massage can be used for a number of reasons. With muscular problems, back pain, neck pain, stagnation can occur in areas of the muscle. Deep Tissue Massage will revitalize these parts of the muscle and gets blood-flow circulating again. This fresh oxygenated blood circulating is a primary reason in the healing of soft-tissue injuries.
When a persons back or neck is in spasm and maybe needs adjustment it is a far better option to work on the muscles first before adjustment. Because these muscles attach onto the vertebrae concerned and fluid pliable musculature makes adjustment easier and more beneficial while relieving pain.
Both sports people and non-sports people often have deep tissue massage done as maintenance. This is to improve circulation and expel toxins before they build up. This prevents ‘breakdown’ in the future, especially those who train and work a lot as neck or back pain can severely hinder normal functioning.

Hi Kit you seem to be a the point i was a month ago and you have my sympathy. But it does get better i am quite happy with my CNC now and i know what i need to do to to improve the little niggles .
As for your torque problem could ya just keep the stepper running slow and gear up the ballscrew with some timing pulleys and belts . That way ya can tune the speed/ torque to the sweet spot . I reckon you could get 2000mm/m no problem even with your 2mm lead screw. But 1610 ballscrews would be better ,10mm pitch tend to be a bit more expensive so i would get the 5mm pitch and do a bit of gearing . So ya save a bit on money and ya have the flexibility to changing the torque band .
Quite happy with this and noise levels although it doesn't sound it on video i know but outside shed ya cant here it at all.
Speeds and feed very leisurely 5000rpm and 450mm/m but that seemed to be the quietest combination. I know i could go a lot faster but as long as the relationship between feed and spindle is correct and the the tool isn't getting hot your top speed is irrelevant. In manufacturing i suppose speed is a issue but as i said not really a problem for me . I also think theirs a bit a Youtube machismo about how fast ya can get your CNC router to run . A case of my red button is bigger than yours
He his a clever fella always learn something watching his videos. Afraid large diameter tools doesn't apply to me most of the stuff i do is quite small with tight radius so biggest tool i prob ever use is 6mm and i do need to go down to 1mm occasionally . Also because i am running my spindle a such low speeds i think it would struggle with larger cutters .
Ps Kit i think a 3 to 1 gear ratio would get your 2mm leadscrew going at a decent speed and the stepper should still have enough torque me thinks .
Your wooden base may be vibrating too, is it resting on something solid enough? Or maybe it is the part, the way it is attached.
The chip size seems a little small to me, it is almost pleading to plunge deeper and then move onward? But of course you need the torque for that and 5000 is probably not enough. Push it to 10000 maybe?
I've been scanning through YouTube to see what others are doing and I must say the majority of DIY router videos are not too good, but you have a few fantastic ones with relatively low specs routers, so it can be done.
Here is a video of something similar to yours (far from perfect) but listen to the sound of cutting after it plunges. You can hear the chatter when plunging down to depth (too rough due to too sudden a plunge) but once at the right depth, it moves along relatively nicely. He should also reduce the stickout.
Hi Edward yes i would say theirs some vibration you can see the chips vibrating around on the work piece . But i think this is the work piece moving its only screwed to a bit of MDF and it also close to cutting through in my vid you can hear it begging the tab cut .
So when the ali bed is fitted everything will be a lot more solid on the work piece front .As for speeds chips and everything my test is touch the tool when ya finished if ya can hold it comfortably then ya doing well and i can
But that is it am afraid it cuts to a standard i need and its not loud basically going faster makes it louder . Believe me i have tried its hard to tell from peoples videos what the actual noise levels are but when ya in a shed with a machine it quickly becomes apparent .
Wow! This has been an epic ride over 11 pages. So much useful information and exchange of knowledge and ideas. How will we cope without a D1 thread to read and write of an evening? We definitely need a thread just to chat about what we're all up to. I think we should call it "DISPLACEMENT 1's Front Room."
Getting back to the exchange of knowledge, I've finally found some useful stuff on stepper motors in a thread from 2008 on the MYCNCUK forum. It's a bit mathematical but actually tells you what you want to know about size and speed of motors required for a job. There's a spreadsheet to do all the maths for you which shows up some very interesting stuff. Most notable is how rapidly the torque from a motor drops away as the speed rises above the 'corner' speed, which is about 450rpm for an average NEMA23. I've been asking mine for 1500rpm and more so I think I see the problem! The spreadsheet also includes a calculation of max rotational speed for leadscrews. For a 1605 ballscrew 1000mm long this is 774rpm which equates to 3800 mm/min. I'd quite like to be able to rapid at up to 6000mm/mim, therefore I might be going back to a belt-driven router!
Hi Kit yes it would be good to keep swapping ideas bit i really have run out of steam on this one . I can feel summer on the way ( well not really its quite miserable at mo ) and i need to get on with my camper conversion
Both you and Edward are on with interesting builds and i would love to see how they turn out . Maybe its time to start a new thread for just general waffling . So if anybody would like to do that i am sure i will still put in my two penneth .
But yes 11 pages is enough i think it gets to the point when you start repeating things .The lathe situation was a close one if you go back in this thread Chardie their was a page or two on the subject .
Whoops just checked this thread it must have been another thread on this forum where we talked about lathes. My brain not as as sharp as it used to be
It's very definitely summer here, 46 degrees (114 in old money) this afternoon. It's 9pm and still 36 in the shed. No camping for us in this weather, all-night air-conditioning is a must for an ex-pom if you want to get a good night's kip.
Still plenty to talk about. I've discovered a whole pile of info from the MYCNCUK website including a surprisingly affordable yet recommended supplier of leadscrews on Aliexpress.com. I've never used Aliexpress before but this supplier is mentioned several times as reliable so I'm beginning to settle my plans for what to do about my recent disappointing upgrade after a day or two of wildly changing my mind!
I simply don't know how you can stand that kind of heat, the poor air-con compressors must be working hard to keep you alive!
The MYCNCUK forum is one I visit frequently and post to sometimes. It is very good to learn everything CNC and they tend to be very helpful.
I've ordered from Aliexpress a few times, no problem, it's like ordering from Amazon really. I recently ordered some super duper ballscrews with bespoke machined ends costing about a grand in total, and I was therefore a bit nervous, but the guys I dealt with where fantastic, polite, efficient and knew their stuff. Everything arrived as planned.
The link you sent is a popular one with CNC guys, order with confidence. 10mm pitch is the norm for wood. I have 5mm because I will be doing ali mainly, my ballscrew revs will be around 1000, about the limit according to your link. I don't think I have any issues with torque on my Nema 3.1 Nm motors using the EM806 drivers (low inductance, parallel wiring) and 70V supply. It's what all the guys use at that forum with far bigger machines than yours or mine with no problems.
D1, maybe you feel you have reached the end of the line, but you still have improvements to make, like the sound enclosure, your ali bed and so on, so please keep posting, if you have the time. I think you just have the winter blues, that's all:)
January for Christie and I here (Exmouth, Western Australia) is much the same as it always was in England: We hide indoors burning lots of electricity to adjust the temperature
Fortunately the shed (aka 'studio') has air-con but I only went out there for a few minutes so didn't switch it on. You do get a bit fed up with this heat after the 'poms-in-the-tropics' excitement wears off. In colder climes you can add clothes when it's too cold. Here you can't stay cool even in your birthday suit, you just get burnt instead.
Thanks for that information. I'm now confident that I'm on the right track to get my router working to an adequate standard for now, if only to cut out some of the more complicated wood shapes for it's own next upgrade and some prototype parts for a couple of other projects that are on hold. I would have posted some pictures of my oscilloscope tests the other day but couldn't get 'screen grab' working for some reason. It was enough to make me want to look at an alternative to LinuxCNC software and go for an external pulse generator card so there's another project to add to my list! Something will get finished eventually, though half of my current projects seem to be dependent on each other.
If I may weigh in late. You said at 50mm / sec power is down. And at a motor speed of 1,500 rpm. In my experience that's about the upper speed limit for average nema 23 motors.
With any given motor, the only way to reduce the torque roll-off at higher speed is to increase the supply voltage. For example - If you are currently running ~ 36v then increasing to ~ 70 vdc to give a useful increase. (Might need a change of drive of course)
Otherwise as D1 suggests - re-gearing by using a small timing belt is a good idea, so you get a virtual pitch of 4mm - 6mm. But as you also comment - there is a max speed for ballscrews - above which you probably start having vibration problems I expect...
I would agree that for very high speed a timing belt will be better. If you use something like an AT belt profile it will be low backlash. I've seen this used on German made factory industrial equipment and it can work very well.
FYI - As a general rule, larger frame sizes motors have lower max rpm. I believe related to the inertia of the rotor.... though the maximum useful speed of any motor still depends on the load and how aggressive the acceleration is...
I've learned a lot over the last few days. That MYCNCUK post from 2008 and it's spreadsheet actually put some numbers onto the general information given on the GekoDrives website and show how unacceptably fast I was trying to run my motors with these 2mm pitch leadscrews. I don't know the provenance of the information in that post but nobody's debunked it in the last 10 years so it can't be a work of fiction.
At present I'm awaiting a final quote for 10mm lead ballscrews from a recommended supplier on AliExpress. These will give me the kind of feed speeds I want for cutting wood without exceeding the corner speed of the motors or the recommended max speed of the ballscrews themselves as specified in the same spreadsheet mentioned above. I'm hoping the present motor drivers and 36v supply will cope for now. An upgrade of all the electronics is on my ToDo list and that will definitely include an increase of supply voltage to around 70v.
Nice Excel calculator - so long as you can find and convert the motor specs correctly... I doubt it could be "debunked" given the 3 x safety margin it uses!
To calculate the approximate effect of increasing your motor gearing by 2, you could just double the leadscrew pitch.
I did some adjustments so it can also be used for calculating speeds and motor sizes for a simple slider or dolly. I will probably use 2 x as my margin to start with and see what it tells me...
Well I've gone ahead and ordered the 1610 ballscrews. All future iterations of my CNC router will have no choice but be built around these particular parts.
In almost every use of an electric motor the gearing is arranged to have the load running slower than the motor itself. With 10mm pitch screws if I do need to use belts to change the speeds it will be to run the motor faster rather than speed up the screws and whip them into a frenzy. This is definitely the better option.
The motors I have are rated at 1.9Nm. I think for my tabletop machine which will be mostly used for cutting wheels for wooden clocks and similar sized jobs I should be OK.
PS For the Z axis I'm still going be using a NEMA17 motor and an 8mm x 8mm pitch ACME screw. To parody what someone wrote in the MYCNCUK forum: there's no point building a Z axis that could raise the Titanic, it just adds unnecessary weight to the gantry. Also, backlash isn't an issue in a vertical screw carrying the weight of the spindle.
"In almost every use of an electric motor the gearing is arranged to have the load running slower than the motor itself."
That may be an accurate observation, but not a reason for not to gearing up when necessary. You know it was fairly common for the industrial shafts driven from steam engines to be geared up - due to the slow moving nature of the piston and flywheel... your situation could be seen as analogous...
Have you been watching those old Fred Dibnah documentaries again? This talk of steam engines reminds me of the comment I used to make regarding my first motorbike, a 1958 (same age as me) Matchless 250cc single..."All torque and no action".
You are right of course, though in this instance I'm more concerned with the vibrations that would result from the whip on two 1m long 10mm diameter leadscrews hurtling round at up to 3,000rpm.
I see no problem with up gearing i find my steppers impossible to stop at slow speeds so whats the problem of using all that torque . Their seems to be a challenge of getting steppers to run fast but thats not what they like doing . Edwards vid was very impressive very fast but no load .
All i am saying is rather than using a flexible coupler use a timing belt and pulleys cost is prob about the same . I have already discovered the spring type of connectors are just not man enough for this type of application so ya up to Oldham lovejoy type which can be expensive for decent ones . So timing pulleys and a decent belt is a cost effective solution . Plus you can tweek things more to hit the power range of your motor driver power supply set up .
I dont think maths calculations can ever tell you what is the best combination of things suck and see is the best approach . Theirs just to many variables at play . Quality of motor and driver , how high a voltage applied , the amount of micro stepping . even the length and type of wire to motor can effect things . Not to mention the amount of mechanical inertia in the drive train . You would spend so much time trying to quantify these things so you can calculate the end result .Its just quicker to put it all together and fiddle for a bit plus i am no good at maths
Kit i would not worry to much about a 1meter ballscrew wibbling about . If its straight and mounted right you should be fine . My gantry ballscrew is about that length and it runs sweet . Its when i get to a meter and a half i seem to have problems it sags enough i middle to start wibbling ( my technical term)
D1. If you look at the excel spreadsheet in question, you'll find it doesn't require any math at all. It makes calculations on your behalf for inertia and friction in the system. Input the screw length, diameter and pitch tand it reports maximum safe rpm. Then input the motor specs and it estimates if it is going to run at your desired speed, and with how much margin. While there is a fairly large safety margin in the calculations, it does serve as a useful reference for analysis of a new or current system, and interesting to compare with your suck it and see approach......
2) 1 ballscrew centrally mounted below bed would be better than two as long as your gantry is no wider than 1 meter
4) If you running a stepper at reasonable speeds attained by 10mm pitch ballscrew and timing pulleys then cheap power supply is fine .
5) Because of high spindle speeds feeds depth etc are critical and getting a decent cut can be frustrating . On my vertical mill with a spindle speed of 2500 it was easy to get a good cut as settings dont have to be spot on . Higher spindle speeds extenuate all problems like gumming up tool waste clearance etc .
6) for cutting ali a constant fluid flood would be advisable as makes setting speeds feeds less critical .
7) In ali if ya machining in one small area a lot heat builds up in work piece and this will cause gumming up . If ya machining a large sheet and moving tool rapidly heat doesnt build up . Thats why their are examples out their showing ali plate been machined at ridiculously high speeds . The tool leaves the machining area so quickly no heat is generated . If you were to work a 60mm area at same speeds for a long period a lot of heat would be generated in work piece .
One of the problems I have with the suck it and see approach is the lack of access to nearby suppliers. Deciding to try something I don't already have the parts for introduces a delay of weeks while I wait for parts to arrive in my remote corner of WA from the other side of Australia ( that's the equivalent of Moscow to John 'O' Groats, all by truck) or the other side of the world (SDP/SI in the USA is my preferred supplier for belts and pulleys).
Having that spreadsheet really helped in getting into the right ballpark and has given me the confidence to lash out the $320 on those ballscrews. I've ordered some Oldham couplings as well and will be direct driving the screws, though one member of MYCNCUK suggests using two screws but with one centrally mounted motor and belt drive to prevent any possibility of racking.
There's never going to be the one ultimate best design and, even if there is, none of us can afford to do the research to try every combination of power supply, controller, drivers, motors belt ratio, leadscrew type and pitch. The best we can do is publicise our mistakes to give the next person a leg up and then work out how best to use as many of the bits we've already bought as possible in a better machine.
Hi Kit yes many ways to crack a nut and we all have different priorities some times money no option or availability of parts . I only suggested the timing pulley approach rather oldham connectors because it does give you flexibility to tweak your design as you develop a oldham doesn't .And lets face it once the machine is functioning it can make its own timing pulleys so you not at the mercy of prolonged delivery's .Then as long as you have on timing belt you can tweak to your hearts content. This is the wonder of CNC you should eventually get to the point when you just need to have a good supply of stock material .
Just looking back on post is 3000rpm correct for ballscrew speed you know me and maths If a pitch of 5 equals 5mm of travel per rev would that not give you a feed speed of 15000mm/m ?
is 3000rpm correct for ballscrew speed you know me and maths If a pitch of 5 equals 5mm of travel per rev would that not give you a feed speed of 15000mm/m ?
For ali, I don't think I will need more than 5000mm/m and that's for rapids. For normal cutting, much less. But for wood, you need to move much faster, so the 10mm pitch makes sense, you can always reduce the rpm with pulleys when you are cutting ali. All in all, it makes sense to go for 10mm pitch for versatility. Having said that, mine are 1605, as my main interest is cutting metal. Things may evolve with usage.
If you are after an economic source of pulleys and belts then have a look at Ebay. " silvers-123" also known as Cupcake World - sell bits and bobs for CNC ex Melbourne. In fact they have just about all the mechanical bits you'll ever need.
I have also used SDP-SI but they are very slow and very expensive - but the only resort when I can't get what I want elsewhere.
BeltingOnline in the UK is faster and will customise shaft sizes and fit grub screws, but shipping still tends to up the price a bit...
The other option is PIES in Melbourne, you can call them and make an order - or go online, though prices are a little higher than the UK.
For Oldham couplings I go to RS Components surprisingly... for some things their prices are actually competitive... and they deliver really fast.
Hi Edward. I have a short 10mm pitch Japanese ballscrew which I've had running at 5,000 rpm. Runs smooth.
According to the calculator for a 5mm screw pitch of 10mm diameter and 50cm length, 3,000rpm is the maximum recommended speed. I'm pretty sure the calculation is simply based on the ratio between the diameter and the length of the screw.
I have used the unlikely named 'CNC and Cupcake World' site before, in fact that's where I got my 2mm pitch leadscrews and the 16mm linear rails I use in the Z axis. I obvioulsy hadn't paid enough attention to their choice of pulleys and belts as it is more comprehensive than I realised.
3000rpm is what I'd need to get 6000mm/min rapids out of the 2mm pitch screws. I was setting this as a desirable speed on the basis that if I can get that out of the machine I'll be very unlikely to complain of it being too slow in practice.
One interesting thing to come out of the spreadsheet is that the cutting forces (it recons 5N for wood, 20 for aluminium) are only a small part of the motor load. It's overcoming friction and accelerating the mass of the gantry that need all the force.
I'm sticking with direct drive for the time being as it minimises the mods I need to make to the existing design in order to fit the new screws, but I certainly see the point of being able to experiment with speed v torque. If the 1.9Nm motors have trouble driving the 10mm pitch screws then a reduction drive may be necessary. I just need the machine to be working to some extent so I can use it to make the parts to make it work better!
On another note, I need to get on with fetling my lathe a bit better. Santa brought me not one but two kits of materials for making model Stirling engines but I need the tailstock to be much better aligned than it is now to get those made.
My problem with my ballscrews is not the mass of the gantry its those dammed oil seals they act like little brakes . Its a quite considerable factor you would have to build into any speed calculation for ballscrews . Without then much higher speeds and acceleration could be achieved. Not sure how you would measure the resistance caused by the oil seals and build that into your excel
By way when the gantry is running with no chance of ballscrews stalling its dangerous. Ya cant stop it i have had a 10mm tool just drag the work piece across the bed and it was very tightly bolted down . It could cause serious damage to any thing trapped in it thats why i am mounting a stop button on it .
4 days!!! 4 days!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For my new ballscrews to get from Shanghai to Exmouth, Western Australia. It often takes longer than that to get stuff from Perth.
Hi Kit how the ballscrews going i may have a need for some 10mm pitch for another project so curious. You wouldn't know if they had left hand threads to ? maybe a bit to exotic.
Just made the most expensive storage boxes ever the cnc going to have to do a lot more work before it pays for itself
Very swanky looking storage boxes though! I'm going to have to follow your example, I have too many boxes of bits just stacked up precariously on shelves.
I finally got the machine reassembled and moving yesterday. It looks a bit (OK, a lot) Heath Robinson at present, the ball screws are too long for an exact fit in the existing frames so there are layers of plywood shims at each end. I haven't cut anything with it yet but I think the alignment is reasonably OK. It just needs to be able to cut parts for another upgrade. One that works this time.
With my 1.9Nm motors I've got it running at 120mm/sec which works out at 7.2 m/min with 600mm/sec/sec acceleration. That's using LinuxCNC, a cheap breakout board and $12 stepper drivers at 36V. Some more swanky drivers, a higher voltage and a better source of stable pulses might go faster without stalling. I haven't adjusted the currents up to see if I can tweak a bit more out if it, that's fast enough for me, and I'm well pleased seeing as the current bodged construction isn't as friction-free as it could be. I don't think adding the cutting load is going to make much difference unless I try cutting 20mm Jarrah in a single pass. The 1100mm long screws are only spinning at 720 rpm for that breakneck speed and run smoothly without whip or vibration. I'm well pleased that I decided to go for the 10mm pitch rather than the cheaper and more common 5mm option.
The ball screws seem very good to me. Bear in mind that these are the only ball screws I've ever actually seen in the flesh. They arrived in a sturdy cardboard box wrapped in woven plastic matting to add further strength and are nice and straight with no discernible backlash. The only tiny niggle I can find is that the cutting of the groove cut for the circlip at the free end has raised a burr which prevented the bearing being fitted until I cleaned it up with a needle file. Big deal!
I bought the screws, including end bearings and ball nut housings, from BST Automation on AliExpress and everything went fine. Just like eBay, if you ask for a combined postage quote the total cost comes down quite considerably, though I was a bit worried when Fred (yep, Fred Lee runs the shop) asked me to order some completely different screws from the website in order to get the right price. But he sent me exactly what I wanted as he'd fervently promised he would. Delivery took 4 days using TNT couriers.
Hi Kit well all those speeds sound great really wish i had got 10mm pitch . Dont think you will ever cut at 7.2m/m but handy for rapids . Think the extra cost of the 10mm as saved you money any way . You not having to spend money on high end drivers or power supply's as the steppers are not struggling at all . To late and to expensive for me to change now but anybody else out their go 10mm .
Did you incur any import charges on top of the cost of the ballscrews . Sometimes i do sometimes i dont but we had this discussion before .
Glad ya getting their i am just boxing mine in the noise is not to loud be really annoying thats why dont think you will be cutting at 7.2m/m if ya in same room with it
I'm sure I won't be cutting at 7.2m/min, but it is useful for rapids and manually shifting the gantry during set-up. Being able to reach that speed without a load also means I'm less likely to have missed steps under load at real cutting speeds.
My previous machine was in a box to limit the noise from the Makitia router I used to use. The whine from the motor carried much further than the noise from the cutting tool. I could only do short jobs with the lid down as I have no dust extraction and it tended to get hot inside the box and all the dust created a fire risk. The box is now gone (and so have the neighbours with young children). The new spindle is quieter and one of the reasons for wanting higher cutting speeds is to shorten the job time as I have to stand there holding the vacuum cleaner while the job runs! I have very limited space so when I do get around to fitting dust extraction it will have to be small enough fit on a shelf above the router table.
In Australia there is no import duty or GST (same as VAT) on mail-order good under $1000. Domestic retailers see this as unfair competition and things may change in the coming years but for the time being it makes shopping online very attractive.
As I commented earlier in the thread, I've found that the timing of step pulses from the PC running LinuxCNC is very uneven. This will always be a problem with any program running on a non-real-time operating system so I'm investigating using the g2core software from Synthetos. They make the TinyG controller board but are also developing the more advanced g2core software which runs on an Arduino Due and is available free. This board has an ARM 32 bit processor so is way more capable and faster than the traditional Arduino boards we all know and love. You feed the board your G-code over USB and it generates all the pulses, supposedly with much more accurate timing. Their code also does more sophisticated acceleration/deceleration that other controllers so, they claim, you get less jerking at high speeds.
Unfortunately the software is still at the "you need to be a GitHub-competent computer geek to be able to download, install and use it" stage so I'm scratching my head a lot but making progress.
To manage the G-code files (generated by CamBam as usual) I'm testing out a program called CNCjs. This runs on my W10 laptop and manages the overall job including a preview much like LinuxCNC or MACH3 but then feeds the individual G-code instructions over to the Arduino to control the stepper drivers. Being able to build the new Arduino into the existing control box and remove the dedicated computer, keyboard and monitor will free up a precious bit of bench space.
At present I'm still at the stage of sorting out having the laptop and Arduino talk to each other properly with no actual motors or stepper drivers connected, but it gives me something to do on quiet night shifts. The current headache is how to get the machine details such as steps per mm, max speeds, software limits, acceleration rates etc. etc. fed into the Arduino. This can't be done by CNCjs (as far as I can tell) and the Arduino apparently forgets all that stuff every time it loses power unless you're clever enough to modify the master software itself to make your required values the defaults. F*****G S****D or what!?.
I'm an avid Arduino coder (that sounds a little over confident actually). You're talking about loosing values when power cycling. I'm assuming that you are writing your code via the Arduino IDE in C. You'd want to look at storing those values in the EEPROM that all Arduino contain. This memory area is non-volatile.
The Arduino Due, or more to the point, the ARM processor they chose to make it from, doesn't have the kind of easily accessible EEPROM that we've come to expect. This looks like a bad choice by the designers at the time but they obviously had good reasons for choosing that chip. The Due is the only board the g2core software runs on at present so we're stuck with it.
There are pre-compiled versions of the software with the pre-set values for a number of popular machines available (I hadn't found those when I wrote the previous entry) and it is possible to write a complete configuration to the board every time you start it up, though there are risks in that. I've found another G-code reader program, cncgoko, which is designed to work with g2core and can read a complete configuration from the Due and also read it back so the situation is not as bad as I first feared. I'm hoping that Goko can be made to run a macro which uploads the configuration when it opens the serail connection to the board.
Ultimately I will have to bite the bullet and learn how to compile my own bespoke version of g2core once I have used Goko to find an optimum set of speeds, accelerations etc.
I didn't realise it was an existing setup. I thought you were coding yourself. A little annoying especially for someone like yourself who's probably got the ability to write something like this but wanted a system that is supposed to be user friendly and ready to go.
My cnc controller is one of the cheapie Chinese units that came with the router. Works off the parallel printer port which I understand is much more solid for such processes. Works like a charm though I'd like it to have a few extras like control the spindle but that is only for safety should I leave the unit running when I'm not around. The spindle controller that came with the unit was faulty and so I replaced it but I didn't have the correct output voltage and the motor doesn't run as fast but works fine.
Hello all yes Kit the forum is very quite these days . Is anybody actually building any camera rigs these days all the usual suspects seem to have gone very quite .
Didn't respond to any of your control things as i dont understand such things programming etc . Also i just use old PCs which is very cost effective and hassle free . The one on my vertical mill as prob been running about 5 years now without a single glitch not bad for £40 ponds . I will stick to this method until i run out of XP machines with correct connectors .
Bit more work on CNC but nothing interesting prefer to use it rather than mess about all time . But stop switch on gantry was a must do and gave a good place for mister controls which works fine . Tool zero pad also plugs int their to.
Boxing in almost their just needs front panel and doors 50mm insulation all round so should cut noise down a bit .
Good point about old computers. You can get old Dell and HP compact desktop machines which are only a few years old for $200 or so which are great single purpose machines. I use one on my CNC and it does nothing but run Mach3 and runs perfectly.
My coding abilities run to long-winded Arduino sketches for simple stuff but converting G-code to motor moves is way out of my league. My current machine uses LinuxCNC on an old PC with a Chinese parallel breakout board and $12 stepper controllers. It's done well for several years and is definately the best option for getting started when you want to spend all the available cash on good hardware for the machine itself.
But the PC is getting a bit flakey, sometimes needs a couple of goes to boot up, and I found that the step instructions are not as equally spaced in time as you'd expect ( see earlier posts) which cannot be helping. Rather than start again loading LinuxCNC onto a new machine I thouht I'd try this option. The only cost is the Due board. I bough a clone from The Old Country. I have a friend who may want to use my services commercially, so I need to up the reliability of the whole machine.
Part of the attraction of the g2core setup is the ability NOT to have a permnently installed PC, monitor and keyboard taking up valuable bench space in my tiny workshop. The Due board will fit in the existing control box and I can take my laptop in when required.
Camera motion control? I suppose the old hands are now busy making films with the equipment they've built. Let's hope so anyway.
Apropos of nothing, I've discovered that the way to engrave on aluminium is not to use a rotating tool. Those in the know use a 'diamond drag engraver' in a spring loaded holder. You may well be aware of this but if not and it's something you are interested in, Google has all the details.
D1, looking good, glad you've decided to encase the router. I'll be curious to have your account of noise levels, with and without the box. If you don't have a decibel meter, you can use an app for your mobile. They are reasonably accurate. Measure at 1m from the cutter is the standard.
I've been away all January basking in the sun in the Canaries and I'm finding it a bit of a struggle to get motivated again, I need a kick in the butt!. I received some hardened steel drill guides to use when drilling or tapping the gantry plate. The thing that's holding me up is the manual router that I am going to use to finish off the edges of large ali plates, as they come quite rough from the suppliers. I am making a jig using Acetal so that I can regulate the sliding distance of the DeWalt router cutter in very small steps, so I can smooth the edge of the thick plate little by little in small incremental passes. I should be able to use a bevel cutter as well.
Kit, I'm glad you got your ballscrews so quickly from Fred. I ordered a servo motor/driver from him and likewise I got it in no time. He's good for Hiwin rails too. If you order rails in the future, make sure you also get the little plastic caps to put in the bolt holes where swarf tends to accumulate, possibly reducing the life of the blocks, if swarf gets in there.
Hi Edward holiday best place to be this time of year . Its going to be a while before i get the doors on my box want to sort out the X motor issue before i get it to boxed in totally .
Hi Kit yes you can make a drag knife attachment to handy for cutting out paper for art and craft things
Having to come home from a holiday: Bummer! Actually we're heading off tomorrow (Friday) for a long weekend at Monkey Mia here in Western Australia. We get to pat wild dolphins and sit on the patio with a glass of wine. Not too dissimilar, bar the dolphins, from being at home actually but it's just the thought of going away to a nice hotel with someone else to do the cooking and sweep the floor that's so nice.
We bought a 'Zing' machine quite a few years back that has a drag knife for cutting plastic stencils for printing onto T-shirts. Works just like that Tormach but is only good for light materials like paper and thin plastic sheets. It's very neat and can handle vinyl banners of any length as one axis moves by pulling the material through the machine with rollers. The blades are fragile as anything though. Drop one onto a hard wooden table top from a few inches and the tips break.
Who's excited for this? Can't wait to see all these dudes together in the same screen...loved the 2nd one, awesome old school action flick..
Actually have high hopes after watching this trailer. The first one sucked hardcore and the second one was ehhhh. Thought it was appropriate how they use Berzerk. Mel Gibson looks promising as the bad guy, however I am worried cuz I saw this one is supposed to be rated PG-13.

PG-13 is a bad thing, this movie deserves to be R rated...but we'll see in the end if its worth it, it's nice to see Wesley Snipes back on screen also
Yeah, i had read Terry Crew's character was written for Snipes in the original, but with all the tax stuff, Crews had to replace him. Sucks cuz Snipes is awesome.
i liked the 1st and 2nd movie's. trailer looks good. Stallone jumping off that exploding/falling building was a bit much. still looking forward to it though.

MongoDB provides clients the ability to perform write operations in bulk. Bulk write operations affect a single collection. MongoDB allows applications to determine the acceptable level of acknowledgement required for bulk write operations.
With an ordered list of operations, MongoDB executes the operations serially. If an error occurs during the processing of one of the write operations, MongoDB will return without processing any remaining write operations in the list. See ordered Bulk Write
With an unordered list of operations, MongoDB can execute the operations in parallel, but this behavior is not guaranteed. If an error occurs during the processing of one of the write operations, MongoDB will continue to process remaining write operations in the list. See Unordered Bulk Write.
Executing an ordered list of operations on a sharded collection will generally be slower than executing an unordered list since with an ordered list, each operation must wait for the previous operation to finish.
Large bulk insert operations, including initial data inserts or routine data import, can affect sharded cluster performance. For bulk inserts, consider the following strategies:
If the sharded collection is empty, then the collection has only one initial chunk, which resides on a single shard. MongoDB must then take time to receive data, create splits, and distribute the split chunks to the available shards. To avoid this performance cost, you can pre-split the collection, as described in Split Chunks in a Sharded Cluster.
To improve write performance to sharded clusters, use bulkWrite() with the optional parameter ordered set to false. mongos can attempt to send the writes to multiple shards simultaneously. For empty collections, first pre-split the collection as described in Split Chunks in a Sharded Cluster.
If your shard key increases monotonically during an insert, then all inserted data goes to the last chunk in the collection, which will always end up on a single shard. Therefore, the insert capacity of the cluster will never exceed the insert capacity of that single shard.
If your insert volume is larger than what a single shard can process, and if you cannot avoid a monotonically increasing shard key, then consider the following modifications to your application:
Reverse the binary bits of the shard key. This preserves the information and avoids correlating insertion order with increasing sequence of values.
The following example, in C++, swaps the leading and trailing 16-bit word of BSON ObjectIds generated so they are no longer monotonically increasing.
Shard Keys for information on choosing a sharded key. Also see Shard Key Internals (in particular, Choosing a Shard Key).

A new version of DLS is available that resolves this issue. This will need to be installed on any client machine experiencing the slow printing issue. You can download it here:
Since 4/23/2018 all users of the windows version of our SDK have been experiencing a 10-15 second slowdown. The issue can also cause performance issues when opening label files in DLS. This appears to be caused by our code attempting to contact 128.30.52.100 (http://www.w3.org/1998/XMLSchema) in order to validate each label before printing.
We have identified a fix for this issue and we are currently expediting a test cycle so we can release a patch as soon as possible.
Until the actual fix goes out, users can alleviate this slowdown by preventing this call. We have seen success with two methods thus far.
Use the windows defender firewall to prevent DYMO.DLS.Printing.Host.exe from making outbound connections.
We apologize for the inconvenience, and will update this post as soon as the situation has been resolved.
To be clear, this issue also impacts DLS.exe. If you launch DLS, it takes a long time to load all your saved labels. Initially, support was saying it was having issues accessing the folders. However, DLS is also trying to validate. If you also setup a block for DLS.exe and then launch it, your labels will load instantly.
Potentially a redundant comment but this is also effecting the MS Word add-on. Rather than a 10-15 second delay my users were seeing 60 second plus pause between clicking the add-on and the print dialog appearing. Blocking the IP was successful.
Hi. I’ve been having the 60 second plus issue too. I downloaded the new version – as stated above. Now it won’t print at all. I have no idea how to block that IP. Can you give me any tips please? Thanks so much!
You might try Uninstalling DLS before Installing the latest version. We have also heard of a couple of instances where a reboot was necessary after the upgrade.
I have started to hear complaints from my clients about slowness when printing. I just check my code and it’s taken 15 seconds when I make this call
Question: I have a program written in C# that uses the DYMO net framework dll’s so I added them to my project references which are copied on the path whenever the program is installed on a client machine. We also ask the client to install the Dymo DLS software. With DLS 8.6.1 and above, we have seen that if both dll’s paths, one under our program and under the Dymo dls program, don’t match versions, the dymo printer is not found. Do you know how can I only use one path as a reference to our program?
It’s pain to have to update the Dymo DLS as well as recompiling our program whenever there is a fix to the DLS.
This also seems to be affecting the Javascript SDK as well. I just started receiving multiple reports from clients about a delay before printing and have experienced this in my own testing.
This redirects all DNS requests for w3.org to go to the local machine, which should immediately deny the connection request (unless you have an http server listening on 127.0.0.1:80)
Thanks for updating us. Our community uses the DYMO almost exclusively over at http://www.accelerlist.com. HOw can we get a line of communication to your dev team? Thanks.
You can reach us through this blog or through the DYMO Support site: http://www.dymo.com/en-US/online-support/online-support-contact-us
It is so slow…….zzzzzzz. Has this issue got anything to do with EXCEL keep disabling the Dymo Add-In feature? Each time I try to print a list of address via EXCEL Add-In, it crashes and disable the add-in. Seem to be something related to DEP?
The new version 8.7.1 fixed the slow print issue. It also fixed the issue with Add-In launch from EXCEL 2016. However, when we close the EXCEL file, and re-open, the Add-In would be moved back to “Inactive Application Add-ins” again. So we have to each time manually go into EXCEL Options > Add-Ins > Manage Com Add-Ins > Tick Dymo Option again.
Hi guys, thanks for your quick action on this and you’re clear, open communication. If only every supplier was this good.
I’ve managed to get my users working with the firewall fix, however we do have an issue, which may or may not be related to this.
I think this issue is unrelated, however we are working on a fix for this issue as well. I would look for a release on this issue in about a month.
On another note, the download is REALLY slow. We’re getting multiple reports of slow or timed out connections in trying to download the update. In my own experience, it took nearly an hour to download the 162MB file on a 100Mb/s cable internet connection.
For comparison, it takes about 30 seconds to download a 200MB file from https://www.thinkbroadband.com/download
How does this impact me when I use dymo printer for address labels and I DO want to verify the address?
Tried installing the latest 8.7.1 update on a client machine but my custom program written in previous SDK version 8.6.1 got an error when it tries to look for the default Dymo printer (a Twin Turbo 450). I am guessing will have to wait for new SDK to recompile.
there were no changes to the code that finds/selects printers. You may want to make sure your printer is still installed. You also may try unplugging your printer (from the computer), deleting your printer (in the control panel) and plug the printer back in. This should do the trick.
Would have been nice to have known this before this morning (Sunday). We check in 100 children and 80 workers every Sunday using self checkin. We have 9 checkin stations. Today was an absolute disaster trying to figure out what was going on. NOW that the rush dealing with telling everyone to be patient is over, I had time to search and find this post.
SO, will the problem be resolved BEFORE next Sunday? Or, do I need to try to patch all 9 computers, only to have to do it again later???
I was wondering if you were going to release updated Android SDK code for your new Wireless LabelWriter. I am developing an app that features your new Wireless LabelWriter, but I am having difficulties writing code that will print to it. Please respond as soon as you can. I look forward to any and all updates on the Android code.
An Android (and iOS) SDK release is on our roadmap but I don’t have an approximate time for release.
Please next time write a new post, so I can get notified thru my RSS reader and not be forced to check the website for updates. Thanks :)
Any update regarding the issue where the installer process spawns a new process and terminates before the installation has completed? I posted about this previously here. Another user has generously supplied a workaround but it’s not an ideal solution, especially since it seems the installer may require a restart and there is no way to retrieve the exit code to determine whether that is the case.
Should this fix completely eliminate the increased (~15s) the wait time on DYMO.Label.Framework.Label.Open() calls? It seemed to work on my machine, but when I deployed to one of my clients (I halted deployment after the first), the wait time remained and now I’m getting a NullReference Exception when I call .Print(). I’ve tried disconnecting the printer, uninstalling, reinstalling, rebooting, etc with no change. I’m afraid to roll it out to my other deployments for fear that the same thing will happen. This is game-breaking for me… Anyone else still having slowdown issues or issues with the NullReference Exception on .Print calls?
Before taking any further action, I would recommend printing a label from DLS on the client machine. Also, confirm the DLS version from the about box.
Hello DYMO, one of clients did a Microsoft Windows Update today, and the DYMO 450 Turbo has stopped printing. Says the printer is ‘ERROR State’. The printer is using the latest release mentioned Rain this post. Any ideas on how to fix this ? Thanks in advance.
Can your user print from DLS to this printer? If not, try unplugging the printer, removing the printer from the control panel, and replugging the printer in. This should get things back to normal.
Thanks Ron. That worked for the wired printers, but the DYMO Wireless one will still not print over the Wifi. Says ‘Printer in Error State’. Any ideas ? Thanks.
Can you view the printer from the control panel? Is there an error indication when viewed from the control panel?
As a last resort, you can reset your wireless printer to factory default, re-add your printer to your wireless network and re-add your printer to the client machine. This should reset the whole thing.
If you look on the back of the unit you will see a small reset button. Press it with a pen tip and it will reset.
The computer that did ‘not’ have Microsoft Windows Update, works fine, but the upgraded computers don’t.
The latest windows update has a defect in it that we are trying to work around. Try plugging your printer in via USB and see if the issue resolves. Once we have a workaround in place, we will release a patch to fix this issue.
Our clients can print using the USB cable, but when the printer is made shareable, it still cannot be seen by others on the Wireless network. Any ideas why ?
In the past we were able to hard wire (via USB) the printer to one computer and have the other computers access on the wireless network
What version of windows are you running? If you are running Windows 10 you can look at your sharing options via:
Control Panel->Network and Sharing Center->Advanced Sharing Settings. You may need to change your settings here if you cannot share your printer.
Some of our clients are getting very upset because this issue with the wireless printer and Windows Update. We are at the risk of losing one client.
A fix is being worked on. It appears that you can re-install Apples Bonjour after the windows update to alleviate the issue. Give this a try and let me know if it works for you.
Thanks Ron. However, the client is not running Apple products. They are trying to print from PC’s. How will Apple Bonjour help with that ?
We have installed the new DYMO exe and we are experience slow printing times… I’m using the Javascript Framework to print the Labels. This happen on some machines not all. Is there anything we can look at to find out why it is slow on some machines??
This was a known problem on an older version of DLS. Make sure all of the machines have the latest DLS installed.
They tested using the Dymo Label software that comes with the exe , and did not get the issue, only when printing the label via the JavaScript framework.
In my experience, users with slower computers or computers bogged down with running programs and browser extensions can have significant delays when printing their first label with the DYMO JavaScript framework. Subsequent printing performs better. The only solution to that (when the computer belongs to your user) is to make your application as lightweight as possible.
As for your second point, printing can happen in one of two resolutions with the higher resolution resulting in slower print speeds. The default setting is Auto which selects the higher resolution when the label contains certain objects. You can set the print parameter “printQuality” to ‘Auto’, ‘BarcodeAndGraphics’ or ‘Text’. Choosing Text will print with the lower resolution and higher print speed.

Making use of an atonement spell moves the character's posture within the alignment observe the minimum amount amount of money to return the character to his prior alignment. For instance, a fallen paladin using atonement to become good once more shifts her place on The great-evil track to three, even if she originally was at 2 or one. The spell is often a means of reversing the worst of the indiscretion, not for attaining a safe buffer within an alignment zone on the observe, and this gives the character an incentive to operate toward entrenching herself in the tenets with the restored alignment.
The important thing to holding all the things lined up and not heading in the future sideways would be to determine or measure the thrust-line of the car and align Just about every wheel to this thrust line. The desired thrust line is the middle line of the car. This is often calculated, not from the human body, which isn't positioned accurately more than enough with respect into the suspension pivots to generally be helpful.
Spoke nipples have an everyday correct-hand thread, but that As you're truing a wheel, you're going to be taking a look at the nipple upside-down, so It's important to convert the spoke wrench clockwise to loosen and counter-clockwise to tighten.

I almost fell off my chair when I saw this! YAY! My mom's side of the family is Swedish and she loves anything with a dala hest on them. Perfect timing to get started with making her something for Christmas. Thanks! :-D
I have one of these little horses as a Christmas ornament. Thank you for sharing, I don't cross-stitch (I can, I just don't VBG) but a colleague does. She'll love this.
I was excited when I saw this, I went to college in Lindsborg, Kansas which has a strong Swedish heritage. Many people had these horses with their names on them near their front door. I have a small Christmas ornament like this and also a bigger one that I did in needlework.
Thank you so much for this gorgeous pattern. I was going to make a felt dala horse for my tree this year, but a cross stitch one will be even better. This pattern will be perfect.
Mange tak! Though my needlework skills are something less than to be desired.. I think this is a pattern I am capable of doing & look forward to surprising my Farmor with just in time for Christmas. : )

JIAXING, China — A Chinese factory has been doing a brisk business selling giant inflatable roosters, some as tall as 16 feet, based on a design widely perceived in China to resemble President-elect Donald Trump.
Yifang Inflatables, a factory in the city of Jiaxing, near Shanghai, began selling the inflatables after images of a large sculpture of a similar design outside a shopping center in the northern city of Taiyuan went viral on social media last month.
The original statue was designed by U.S.-based artist Casey Latiolais, whose website displays the rooster next to a similar design that borrows elements of a Trump election slogan. Chinese state media have described the rooster as "sporting the President-elect's signature hairdo and hand gestures."
Wei Qing, owner of the factory in Jiaxing, said they have sold around 100 of the roosters, in sizes from 2 to 5 meters (7 to 16 feet) tall, to shopping centers in mainland China and Taiwan. Wei said some customers think the rooster resembles Trump but that the manufacturers had no say over that.
The social media sensation comes as China prepares to celebrate the lunar Year of the Rooster starting Jan. 28, the country's most important traditional holiday.
"It does seem like it's got a personality, more so than chickens in previous years" in the Chinese zodiac, Wei said. "But because this is China's Year of the Rooster, it has gone viral on the internet."

This Electron Multiplier section from this RCA tube is an improved version of the one from the image dissector tube of Philo Farnsworth.
In the early days of television, moving picture transmission was only possible by mechanical transmitters and receivers. The development of the CRT which could be used as an electronic replacement of the mechanical receiver forced the researchers to produce an electronic eye to replace the mechanical flying spot principle from Manfred von Ardenne which was more or less successfully used for the transmission of film in the beginning with 30 and later with 180 scanlines.
Campbell Swinton described this all electronic television system in Nature June 1908, info can be found at the site of Bairdtelevision.
Several inventors clamed to have the first ideas for single or double sided target camera pickup tubes, the Hungarian engineer Kolomon Tihanyi claimed the invention of the Iconoscope storage principle, which later was used by Zworykin.
A patent of Kolomon Tihanyi's 1926 Application úRadioskop can be found here but the British one was never granted. Several other people inbetween 1924 and 1931 claimed to file the first pickup tube patents like Francois Charles Pierre Henrouteau (1928) George J.Blake and Henry D.Spooner (1924), Riccardo Brunni(Photoscope 1928) and S.I. Kataev ( Iconoscope 1931)
The first patent (not granted) for the Iconoscope of Zworykin (RCA) dates from 1923 based on his early ideas from 1919, the American Philo Taylor Farnsworth however claimed he had his first ideas of his Image dissector tube in 1922 when he, at an age of 14, made a drawing of his TV pickup tube on the blackboard of his school.
Farnsworth patented his all electronic TV system on Jan 7, 1927. By Sept 7, 1927 he was able to send a single horizontal line of light on the face of a CRT. The dissector tube however, became never a successful television pickup device and was mainly used to scan film and dia-positives, this was the result of a lack of sensitivity, it was in fact a cold cathode tube.
TV broadcast was not easy with the dissector tube because of the enormous amount of light needed for an acceptable picture, despite all he managed to transmit from August 25 1934 for ten day's live electronic television, he was the first ever. Kenjiro Takayanagi made the first camera tube for Japan and presented his all electronic TV system also in 1936. The next year German Nazi TV started regular broadcasting in Berlin using their first Iconoscope cameras at the Olympic Games in 1936.
Farnsworth's Image dissector and his TV display tube the "oscillite" a low pressure gas filled CRT, were no match for the mighty RCA (David Sarnoff). This was the beginning of the all electronic TV age, it was a race of patents which RCA eventually won. RCA didn't wanted to pay royalties but would only buy the dissector patent of Farnsworth for use of the multiplier section in the future development of the Image Orthicon. With this arrangement ended the great struggle between Farnsworth and RCA.
The first Iconoscope tubes that Zworykin developed for RCA were about 1000 times more sensitive than the Farnsworth Image dissector which had no storage capacity, the Iconoscope tubes used the "gathering effect" to collect electrons coming from the photo cathode to the mica target. But only 5-10% effectivity was reached, another disadvantage of the Iconoscope tube was shadow forming, due to the irregular form of the electron cloud in front of the target. This could be seen as dark spots on the receiving image on the upper left and bottom left of the picture.
The successor of the Iconoscope was the Super Emitron, patented in May 1934 by Hans G. Lubszinski and Sydney Rodda of EMI England, the patent later went to RCA due to an earlier conception date. The image of the Super Emitron was not formed by the photo-emission to the target plate itself, but by photo-electrons which came free by the illumination of a Photo Cathode in front of the target. This tube was much more efficient than the standard Iconoscope tube.
Even more progress was made with the Riesel-Iconoscope. In the Riesel tube there was a second photo sensitive Cathode in the form of a ring nearby the target. From this Cathode a constant flow of slow electrons was dripping to the target. (rieseln = dripping) This became a new shadow compensation to overcome the the old problem. The Riesel Iconoscope tube was only used on the mainland of Europe and had a 10 times higher sensitivity than the regular Iconoscope tube.
Harley Ambrose Iams and Alberts Rose (RCA) developed in 1938 the Orthicon tube, although it was theoretically a simpler design than the Iconoscope, building this tube was much more difficult. This Orthicon tube was used for the first NBC/RCA TV broadcasting in NewYork June 1940.
It took another five years to build a new and better one, the Image Orthicon. It used the Electron Multiplier section like the Image Dissector tube which was developed by Philo Tayler Farnsworth. Development of the first 3" Image orthicon started in 1944 with the LM5 for the use in guided missiles followed by the smaller MIMO (miniature image orthicon). This was a great advance for the postwar TV industry, RCA presented the fist public demonstration Oct 25 1945, the production was extended for a short time with the building of the huge 4,5" Image orthicon which was even more sensitive but much larger than the former ones and also more expensive. Image Orthicons were valued and insured for 500-1000 pounds at the BBC in 1950, in those days a lot of money !
To overcome this, the Vidicon tube was eventually developed in 1950, there was no need to be superior to the Image orthicon, but to produce camera tubes in a more economic way. Vidicon tubes were used until 1970 when the first solid state CCD camera came on the market. Even today the Vidicon and Vidicon-like tubes are still used in the industrial, medical and military environment.
The electron gun on the above is the same as the one on the picture. Found in a flea market! Probably all that is left today of this early 1935 Philips camera tube.

(4) Phan Nguyen on the firing of Steven Salaita: At Mondoweiss, an excellent two–part take-down of Cary Nelson, the U. of Illinois-Urbana-Champaign English professor and former president of the AAUP, who has defended the university’s firing (which is what it is when you withdraw a job offer that has been accepted, and the candidate and his spouse have resigned their positions to move to the new job) of Steven Salaita, a Palestinian-American scholar for tweets critical of Israel’s assault on Gaza. It appears that there was a coordinated campaign of right-wing bloggers to target Salaita. I’m proud my philosopher friends Jason Stanley (of Yale) and Ralph Wedgwood (of USC) have written strong letters in support of Salaita and publicized his firing on Facebook. Here’s what Ralph said, with characteristic flair, on FB when the UIUC trustees upheld Salaita’s firing: “In view of the statements that have been released today by the administration of the University of Illinois, I’m perfectly happy to boycott their university until such time as either (a) they convince me that they have ceased to be the enemies of academic freedom, or (b) I draw my dying breath (whichever is sooner).” Also check out political theorist Bonnie Honig’s letter to UIUC chancellor Phyllis Wise, posted at the website of political scientist Corey Robin, who has been publicizing the Salaita affair; and finally, see an analysis of the legal issues by Michael C.

For my birthday I took myself out to see RED last night, and it was great. I haven’t read the comic, but you can see Warren Ellis’ fingerprints all over it. I’m a sucker for movies about old farts anyway, but RED is a terrifically entertaining amalgam of Sneakers+Ronin+Grumpy Old Men.
And let me just state, categorically, that at 65 Helen Mirren is still just about the goddamned sexiest thing I’ve ever seen in a movie, and I would bang the doors off that woman in a heartbeat.
I also had the treat of sitting through the worst trailer I have seen for a movie since Next of Kin. If you haven’t seen the trailer for Drive Angry, you owe it to yourself. It is absolutely ridiculous, and proves yet again Nicolas Cage’s insatiable urge to embarrass himself. This is the first trailer I’ve ever seen worthy of its own Rifftrax.
If the movie is half as bad as the trailer, it should be The Room of car/driver from Hell movies (and, yes, there’s a long precedent of precisely that; The Car, Christine, The Wraith… shall I continue?)
This morning I looked at the news and discovered that Dino De Laurentiis had died on my birthday. Despite being 5’ 4”, Dino was a giant in the film industry, and was a huge influence on my childhood. He was one of the last old-school independent producers. He never directed a film, and probably never wanted to, but he was the driving force behind hundreds.
Many of the movies De Laurentiis produced are cultural icons, pieces of gaudy fluff that have become cool or camp or kitsch because of their shamelessness or over-the-top style. Movies like Danger: Diabolik, Barbarella, Flash Gordon, Dune or Mandingo. I personally dislike every one of these films, but each has its following.
Like many Italian filmmakers, De Laurentiis didn’t distinguish between the pomp and the circumstance. All art was opera, and all stories were to be told on the grandest, loudest, most gaudy scale possible. Every painting deserved a bigger canvas. If De Laurentiis had been a jacket, he would have been made from red velvet and gold lamé.
For me, De Laurentiis was Conan the Barbarian, Death Wish, The Shootist (the first time I cried in a movie), Three Days of the Condor, and his awful remake of King Kong that I watched in awe and disappointment at the age of 8 in the biggest theater in Phoenix.
Tycoon, shlockmeister, showman and crook, Dino De Laurentiis was a bastion of Golden-Age Hollywood bombast and we’ll never see his like again.

Expert of UNESCO visit to examine the implementation of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict.
UNESCO's expert Mrs Martha Mack Guair visited the DGAM accompanied by Mr. Joseph Krieidi (Programmer Officer at the Cultural Sector at UNESCO Regional Bureau at Beirut) on 25 – 26 June 2018. The aim of this visit was to examine the implementation of the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (The Hague) which was supplemented and clarified by two protocols concluded in 1954 and 1999 . The first protocol was signed by Syria on 1958.
The Director - General of the DGAM chaired the meeting in the presence of Dr. Nidal Hassan secretary General of Syrian National Commission of UNESCO and representative from the DGAM staff. The meeting, which took place on 25-26 June 2018 at the General Directorate of Antiquities and Museums, was particularly important in the light of the deliberate destruction, looting, theft and illegal trafficking of cultural heritage sites by terrorist and extremist groups.
The discussions focused on the results of the implementation of the Convention since its signing and the preparations made by the Directorate General of Antiquities and Museums during the crisis to protect cultural property, in addition to the procedures and guidelines necessary to activate the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in times of armed conflict and how to enable Syria to benefit from it and its possible accession to Protocol II of this Convention.
The Director-General pointed out that the establishment of such a convention as a legal framework was an essential element, but in the case of the war in Syria, it was not effective for establishing a system of protection. He further commended the need to prosecute and punish individuals who committed such violations and to criminalize them under national or international law.

Habitat :Avena orientalis is native to Southern Europe. It grows in dry wasteland, cultivated ground and meadows, especially on heavier soils.
Avena orientalis is an annual olant. It is not frost tender. It is in flower from Jun to July, and the seeds ripen from Aug to October. The flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by Wind.Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils, prefers well-drained soil and can grow in heavy clay soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It cannot grow in the shade. It prefers dry or moist soil and can tolerate drought…CLICK & SEE THE PICTURES
We have very little information on this species, but it should be possible to grow it as a spring-sown annual in Britain, and might also succeed as an autumn-sown crop. Occasionally cultivated for its edible seed, especially in S.E. Europe, this species is considered to be no more than a part of A. sativa by many botanists. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Succeeds in any moderately fertile soil in full sun. Oats are in general easily grown plants but, especially when grown on a small scale, the seed is often completely eaten out by birds. Some sort of netting seems to be the best answer on a garden scale.
Seed – sow in situ in early spring or in the autumn. Only just cover the seed. Germination should take place within 2 weeks.
Seed – cooked. The seed ripens in the latter half of summer and, when harvested and dried, can store for several years. It has a floury texture and a mild, somewhat creamy flavour. It can be used as a staple food crop in either savoury or sweet dishes. The seed can be cooked whole, though it is more commonly ground into a flour and used as a cereal in all the ways that oats are used, especially as a porridge but also to make biscuits, sourdough bread etc. The seed can also be sprouted and eaten raw or cooked in salads, stews etc. The hull is incompletely attached to the grain, yielding a naked seed easily upon threshing. The roasted seed is a coffee substitute.
The straw has a wide range of uses such as for bio-mass, fibre, mulch, paper-making and thatching. Some caution is advised in its use as a mulch since oat straw can infest strawberries with stem and bulb eelworm.

Taraxacum heterolepis is a perennial plant. The flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by Insects.The plant is self-fertile.
Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils.
We have very little information on this species and do not know if it will be hardy in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in many parts of the country. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Prefers a well-drained humus-rich soil in full sun or light shade. Many species in this genus produce their seed apomictically. This is an asexual method of seed production where each seed is genetically identical to the parent plant. Occasionally seed is produced sexually, the resulting seedlings are somewhat different to the parent plants and if these plants are sufficiently distinct from the parents and then produce apomictic seedlings these seedlings are, in theory at least, a new species.
Seed – sow spring in a cold frame and either surface-sow or only just cover the seed. Make sure the compost does not dry out. Germination should take place within 2 weeks. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle, choosing relatively deep pots to accommodate the tap root. Plant them out in early summer. Division in early spring as the plant comes into growth.
Leaves – raw or cooked. The roasted root is a coffee substitute. The following uses are also probably applicable to this species, though we have no records for them Root – cooked. Flowers – raw or cooked. The unopened flower buds can be used in fritters. The whole plant is dried and used as a tea. A pleasant tea is made from the flowers. The leaves and the roots can also be used to make tea.
The stem has been used in the treatment of cancer. A decoction of the whole plant is used in treating abscesses, appendicitis, boils, liver problems, stomach disorders etc. It has been used for over 1,000 years by the Chinese in treating breast cancer and other disorders of the breasts including poor milk flow.
The plant is a commonly used herbal remedy. It is especially effective and valuable as a diuretic because it contains high levels of potassium salts and therefore can replace the potassium that is lost from the body when diuretics are used. All parts of the plant, but especially the root, are slightly aperient, cholagogue, depurative, strongly diuretic, hepatic, laxative, stomachic and tonic. The root is also experimentally cholagogue, hypoglycaemic and a weak antibiotic against yeast infections. The dried root has a weaker action. The roots can be used fresh or dried and should be harvested in the autumn when 2 years old. The leaves are harvested in the spring when the plant is in flower and can be dried for later use. A tea can be made from the leaves or, more commonly, from the roots. The plant is used internally in the treatment of gall bladder and urinary disorders, gallstones, jaundice, cirrhosis, dyspepsia with constipation, oedema associated with high blood pressure and heart weakness, chronic joint and skin complaints, gout, eczema and acne. The plant has an antibacterial action, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Pneumococci, Meningococci, Bacillus dysenteriae, B. typhi, C. diphtheriae, Proteus etc. The latex contained in the plant sap can be used to remove corns, warts and verrucae. The latex has a specific action on inflammations of the gall bladder and is also believed to remove stones in the liver. A tea made from the leaves is laxative. The German Commission E Monographs, a therapeutic guide to herbal medicine, approve Taraxacum officinale for dyspepsia, urnary tract infections, liver and gallbladder complaints, appetite loss for critics of commission E).
Other Uses: The flowers are an ingredient of ‘QR’ herbal compost activator. This is a dried and powdered mixture of several herbs that can be added to a compost heap in order to speed up bacterial activity and thus shorten the time needed to make the compost. A liquid plant feed can be made from the root and leaves. A low quality latex, which can be used for making rubber, can be obtained from the roots of this plant. A magenta-brown dye is obtained from the root. The plant releases ethylene gas, this stunts the growth of nearby plants and causes premature ripening of fruits. A distilled water made from the ligules (thin appendages at the base of the leaf blades) is used cosmetically to clear the skin and is particularly effective in fading freckles.
Known Hazards: This plant has been mentioned in various books on poisonous plants but any possible toxins will be of very low concentration and toxicity[10]. There are reports that some people have suffered dermatitis as a result of touching the plant, this is probably caused by the latex in the leaves and stems.

Habitat : Prunus capsica is native to W. Asia – N. Iran. It grows on the woodland Garden Sunny Edge. Dry sunny slopes amongst shrubs. Forests, thickets, hill grasslands, river valleys and dry sunny slopes at elevations of 400 – 2500 metres.
Prunus capsica is a deciduous Tree. The flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by Insects.Suitable for: light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils and prefers well-drained soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers moist soil.
We have very little information on this species and do not know how hardy it will be in Britain, though judging by its native range it should succeed outdoors in most parts of this country. This species is possibly no more than a cultivated form of P. cerasifera divaricata. The following notes are based on the general needs of the genus. Thrives in a well-drained moisture-retentive loamy soil. Prefers some lime in the soil but is likely to become chlorotic if too much lime is present. Succeeds in sun or partial shade though it fruits better in a sunny position. Most members of this genus are shallow-rooted and will produce suckers if the roots are damaged. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus.
Seed – requires 2 – 3 months cold stratification and is best sown in a cold frame as soon as it is ripe. Sow stored seed in a cold frame as early in the year as possible. Protect the seed from mice etc. The seed can be rather slow, sometimes taking 18 months to germinate. Prick out the seedlings into individual pots when they are large enough to handle. Grow them on in a greenhouse or cold frame for their first winter and plant them out in late spring or early summer of the following year. Cuttings of half-ripe wood with a heel, July/August in a frame. Softwood cuttings from strongly growing plants in spring to early summer in a frame. Layering in spring.
Fruit – raw or cooked. The fruit contains a single large seed. Seed – raw or cooked. Do not eat the seed if it is too bitter – see the notes below on toxicity.
Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, all members of the genus contain amygdalin and prunasin, substances which break down in water to form hydrocyanic acid (cyanide or prussic acid). In small amounts this exceedingly poisonous compound stimulates respiration, improves digestion and gives a sense of well-being.
Other Uses:.…Dye…..A green dye can be obtained from the leaves. A dark grey to green dye can be obtained from the fruit
Known Hazards: Although no specific mention has been seen for this species, it belongs to a genus where most, if not all members of the genus produce hydrogen cyanide, a poison that gives almonds their characteristic flavour. This toxin is found mainly in the leaves and seed and is readily detected by its bitter taste. It is usually present in too small a quantity to do any harm but any very bitter seed or fruit should not be eaten. In small quantities, hydrogen cyanide has been shown to stimulate respiration and improve digestion, it is also claimed to be of benefit in the treatment of cancer. In excess, however, it can cause respiratory failure and even death.

Habitat : Artemisia filifolia is native to North America, where it occurs from Nevada east to South Dakota and from there south to Arizona, Chihuahua, and Texas. It grows on sandy soils in deserts and dry plains. It can grow in semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It prefers dry or moist soil and can tolerate drought.
Artemisia filifolia is a deciduous and branching woody semi-evergreen shrub growing up to 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in) tall. It has feathery, silver-blue foliage.
The stems are covered narrow, threadlike leaves up to 8 centimetres (3.1 in) long and no more than half a millimeter wide. The leaves are sometimes split into segments. They are solitary or arranged in fascicles. The inflorescence is a panicle of hanging flower heads. Each head contains sterile disc florets and 2 to 3 fertile ray florets. The fruit is a tiny achene. The achenes do not tend to disperse far from the parent plant.
The graceful, windswept form is compact and the whole plant is sweetly pungent. Flowers and fruit are inconspicuous.
The flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by Wind.Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils and prefers well-drained soil. Suitable pH: neutral and basic (alkaline) soils.
Easily grown in a well-drained circumneutral or slightly alkaline loamy soil, preferring a warm sunny dry position. Established plants are drought tolerant. Plants are longer lived, more hardy and more aromatic when they are grown in a poor dry soil. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer.
Seed – surface sow from late winter to early summer in a greenhouse in a very free-draining soil, but make sure that the compost does not dry out. The seed usually germinates within 1 – 2 weeks in a warm greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter. Plant them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Division in spring or autumn.
The plant is carminative and stomachic. A tea is used in the treatment of indigestion. An infusion of the plant and juniper branches is used in the treatment of indigestion. A strong infusion of the plant is used as a lotion on snakebites. The plant is also used to treat boils. It is a hayfever plant.
Sand sagebrush seed is sold commercially. It is sometimes used for revegetation efforts on rangeland and coal fields. The Navajo had several uses for the plant. It was used for ritual purposes. Being quite soft, it was used as toilet paper.Good for erosion control.
Known Hazards: Although no reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, skin contact with some members of this genus can cause dermatitis or other allergic reactions in some people.

Habitat :Artemisia tridentate is native to western N. America – British Columbia to California and Mexico, east to Nebraska. It grows on dry plains and hills on calcareous soils. Found on slightly acid and on alkaline soils.
Artemisia tridentata is an evergreen Shrub growing to 2.5 m (8ft 2in). It is frost tender. It is in leaf 12-Jan It is in flower in October, and the seeds ripen from Oct to November. It may have a short trunk or be branched from the base. Small, velvety, silvery leaves have a sweet, pungent aroma and, en masse, give a bluish-gray effect. The flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by Wind.Suitable for: light (sandy) and medium (loamy) soils, prefers well-drained soil and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Suitable pH: acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils and can grow in very alkaline soils.
Requires a sunny position and a well-drained soil that is not too rich. Requires a lime-free soil. There are a number of sub-species growing in different habitats from deep fertile soils to poor shallow ones. Plants are longer lived, more hardy and more aromatic when they are grown in a poor dry soil[245]. Established plants are very drought tolerant. This species is not hardy in the colder areas of the country, it tolerates temperatures down to between -5 and -10°c. The young growth in spring, even on mature plants, is frost-tender and so it is best to grow the plants in a position sheltered from the early morning sun. The plant is very aromatic, especially after rain. The pollen of this species is one of the main causes of hayfever in N. America. Plants in this genus are notably resistant to honey fungus. Members of this genus are rarely if ever troubled by browsing deer.
Seed – surface sow from late winter to early summer in a greenhouse in a very free-draining soil, but making sure that the compost does not dry out. The sub-species A. tridentata vaseyana germinates better if given a cool stratification for 30 – 50 days. Other sub-species germinate in 1 – 2 weeks in a warm greenhouse. When large enough to handle, prick the seedlings out into individual pots and grow them on in the greenhouse for their first winter, planting them out in late spring or early summer. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, July/August in a frame. Very slow to root Division in spring or autumn. Layering
Leaves are cooked and eaten. The subspecies A. tridentata vaseyana has a pleasant mint-like aroma whilst some other subspecies are very bitter and pungent. The leaves are used as a condiment and to make a tea. Seeds are eaten raw or cooked. Oily. It can be roasted then ground into a powder and mixed with water or eaten raw. The seed is very small and fiddly to use.
Sage brush was widely employed by many native North American Indian tribes who used it to treat a wide range of disorders. It is little used in modern herbalism, though it certainly merits further investigation. The plant is antirheumatic, antiseptic, digestive, disinfectant, febrifuge, ophthalmic, poultice and sedative. A decoction of the leaves is used in the treatment of digestive disorders and sore throats. An infusion of the fresh or dried leaves is used to treat pneumonia, bad colds with coughing and bronchitis. It is used both internally and externally in the treatment of rheumatism. The crushed plant is used as a liniment on cuts, sores etc whilst a decoction of the leaves is used as an antiseptic wash for cuts, wounds and sores. A poultice of the steeped leaves is applied to sore eyes. The plant is burnt in the house in order to disinfect it.
A tea made of the leaves has been used to treat headache, stomachache, vomiting, diarrhea, sore throat, and as an antidote for poisoning. Some Indians chewed the leaves to ease stomach gas. A wash made of boiled and steeped leaves was used for treating bullet wounds and cuts, to bathe newborn babies, and as a hot poultice in treating rheumatism. A poultice was also placed on the stomach to induce menstruation, to relieve colic and treat worms. The leaves are boiled in water and the steam inhaled as a decongestant. Warm leaves may be applied to the neck to help a sore throat. The leaves are pungent and have been preferred for making medicine among other sagebrushes.
An infusion of the leaves is used as a hair rinse, it treats dandruff and falling hair. An infusion of the plant repels insects, it is also disinfectant and so is used for washing walls, floors etc. A yellow to gold dye is obtained from the leaves, buds and stems combined. The fibrous bark is used for weaving mats, baskets, cloth etc., or as a stuffing material in pillows etc and as an insulation in shoes to keep the feet warm. A fibre obtained from the inner bark is used for making paper. The fibres are about 1.3mm long. The stems are harvested in late summer, the leaves removed and the stems steamed until the fibre can be stripped off. The fibre is then cooked for two hours with lye before being ball milled for 4 hours. The resulting paper is a light tan/gold colour. A bunch of the leafy stems can be tied together and used as a broom. The shredded bark is a fine tinder for starting fires. The stems make good friction sticks for making fires. The seeds are used during celebrations because, when thrown into a fire, they explode like crackers. Wood – hard, dense. It burns rapidly and well, even when green, and has a pleasant aromatic smell
Known Hazards : Although no reports of toxicity have been seen for this species, skin contact with some members of this genus can cause dermatitis or other allergic reactions in some people

Habitat :Rhododendron luteum is native to Europe – Austria and Poland to Turkey. Occasionally naturalized in Britain. It grows on the mountain meadows, sometimes on limestone, beech and open coniferous forests, to 2200 metres. Grows from sea-level to the sub-alpine zone.
Rhododendron luteum is a deciduous Shrub growing to 3 m tall, rarely 4 m. The leaves are 5-10 cm long and 2-4 cm broad. The flowers are 3-4 cm diameter, bright yellow, and strongly perfumed, produced in trusses of 5-25 together. The fruit is a dry capsule 15-25 mm long, containing numerous small seeds.
It is in flower in May. The flowers are hermaphrodite (have both male and female organs) and are pollinated by Insects.
Succeeds in a most humus-rich lime-free soils except those of a dry arid nature or those that are heavy or clayey. Prefers a peaty or well-drained sandy loam. Succeeds in sun or shade, the warmer the climate the more shade a plant requires. A pH between 4.5 and 5.5 is ideal. Hardy to about -30°c. A very ornamental plant, the flowers are sweetly scented with a honey-like fragrance. Plants self-sow freely when in a suitable position. Succeeds in a woodland though, because of its surface-rooting habit, it does not compete well with surface-rooting trees. Plants need to be kept well weeded, they dislike other plants growing over or into their root system, in particular they grow badly with ground cover plants, herbaceous plants and heathers. Plants form a root ball and are very tolerant of being transplanted, even when quite large, so long as the root ball is kept intact. Plants are tolerant of drought when they are grown under trees. Plants in this genus are notably susceptible to honey fungus.
Seed – best sown in a greenhouse as soon as it is ripe in the autumn and given artificial light. Alternatively sow the seed in a lightly shaded part of the warm greenhouse in late winter or in a cold greenhouse in April. Surface-sow the seed and do not allow the compost to become dry. Pot up the seedlings when they are large enough to handle and grow on in a greenhouse for at least the first winter. Layering in late July. Takes 15 – 24 months. Cuttings of half-ripe wood, August in a frame. Difficult.
Other Uses: Plants are being grown as a medium-sized hedge at Wisley, RHS gardens in Surrey. Commonly used as a rootstock for many of the ornamental cultivars of azaleas.The flower has sweet perfume.
The plant is depicted instead of the crown above the coat of arms of the Local Community of Boštanj. It has been chosen because the area is one of the rare growing places of Rhododendron luteum in Slovenia. The coat of arms was created in 1998 by the artist Rudi Stopar.
Known Hazards: Despite the sweet perfume of the flowers, the nectar is toxic, containing grayanotoxin; records of poisoning of people eating the honey date back to the 4th century BC in Classical Greece.

A resource & referral agency is a local nonprofit organization involved in supporting child care services. In WV, at a minimum, the resource & referral agencies:
In the early 90's, funding for child care began to increase, particularly with the implementation of the Child Care & Development Block Grant Act. For the first time, states were legally required to expend part of their federal dollars on initiatives designed to improve the supply and quality of its child care programs. Each state developed a long range plan with the assistance of planning groups that brought in state and local government as well as providers, parents, advocates and early childhood experts. One of the main components of West Virginia's State plan was to establish child care resource and referral services across the state. A development of the 1970&s, child care resource and referral agencies (CCR&R) were beginning to appear across the country and were seen as a support for state child care efforts. As the title suggests, these CCR&R agencies were to locate resources for child care and refer parents to available child care options. However, as more states began to contract for child care resource and referral services, the array of services provided began to multiply and CCR&R agencies began to provide services above and beyond that simple definition.

CLIMATIC EVENTS - We have implemented the climatic events with Enviro: There are different types of weather: Sunny Cloudy Light rain Light snow Strong rain Strong snow Fog...
This is the latest "turbo crank" deal, being aggressively marketed to snowmobile people now. Turbo crank mods are cicada-like, coming around, being promoted and talked about every few years, then going away.
Is this like the deal that [then TX highschool roadracer Colin Edwards' race team manager] David Herold tested here at DynoTech with you [as team performance consultant] 20 years ago on the [90 HP Yamaha roadrace bike] TZ250? I recall you saying at some point [prior to the dyno test] it couldn't possibly provide meaningful power or airflow boost because the crank wheels were traveling well below the speed of sound [even at 12,000 RPM]. [The stock crank and "turbo" crank as you predicted delivered identical airflow CFM and HP].
The important variable in the design of a centrifugal compressor is its tip speed - the velocity of the impeller tips. The impeller accelerates the air molecules to tip speed, and compression takes place as this energy of motion is converted in the diffuser into the energy of pressure. There is a strict elationship between the two.
Compute the "tip speed" of the crank-become-a-crude-centrifugal impeller as circumference in feet times revolutions per second. If the flywheels are 5" diameter the circumference is about 16 inches, or 1 1/3 feet. If crank rpm is 8500 then revolutions per second are 142. Multiplying the two together gives us a "tip speed" of under 190 feet per second.
Referring to my handy little table "Pressure of Air on Coming to Rest from Various Speeds" I find that an adiabatic pressure rise (adiabatic means with no exchange of heat) of 2% results from 100% efficient operation. Since the crank flywheels are not equipped with a diffuser as centrifugal compressors are, it is unlikely that much of this 2% would appear at the bottoms of the transfer ducts.
To get one atmosphere of compression requires 100% efficient recovery from a wheel with a tip speed of 1200 fps.
6/6 Sat Dave Waters/ RJ Overholt KTM 950 Vtwin flattrack bike w/ required inlet restrictors, Ron Jewell ported heads those nascar-like inlet restrictors hurt airflow and HP, and require vastly different jetting to achieve max HP--we got that perfect, but we can't tweak timing since the ECU is fixed, and the flywheel/ pickup are buried inside several layers of engine case castings...working on timing access
6/15 Maynard Priestly Honda 450 flattrack racer tuned to max HP, wish we had a Keihin slide rule like Mikuni so he can be at max HP jetting regardless of weather
6/18 Justin Gee Polaris PS800 pipe testing took a few hours to cure erratic fuel flow, create max HP jetting and timing, then selected the best overall set of pipes...
assisted N2O, NANO plus Nitrous Express kit the NANO add-on gave us constant 900 psi regardless of bottle temp or amount of liquid left--tuned first to 184 HP max high compression (yes 800cc single pipe, I measured the bore and stroke myself), then detuned compression and timing to 170 HP then added over 100 HP with no clicks of deto using 120 octane gas. The NANO makes n2o tuning consistent and easy.
6/25 Jim Cooper one more time trying to resolve cantancerous fuel flow issues so he can run 1/4 mile without leaning out on top new rebalnced crankwheels by some outfit in Canada, smooth now excellent smooth fuel delivery to CS56 carbs even with solid mounts, mysteriously a bit less HP than his old buzzy crank but having 270hp for a full 8 seconds is better than having 285hp for 4 seconds then tailing off to 250 or worse because float bowls are running dry!
6/25 pm Tripod Dan and Danno PS800 trying for a reasonable HP curve with compression dropped to 18/1 (was 20/1 last time with awful spikey detonating results). came with less compression and new MSD set way too far advanced, preignited and frosted a plug with no clicks of deto, will come back after repairs are made.
6/30 Jason Owen two mod cats Jay and his pal Trevor had cams off, struggled with a bad EFI controller, will tune another day
7/3 Friday Dean Sutter dragbike w/ Polaris mod sled engine installed cams off profession tin-knocker Dean had a slick set of hand rolled and welded pipes w/ sliding center sections and sliding stingers, optimized carburetion then while rolling timing back and forth with an external adjuster, tweaked CS length to max HP then got best HP with stingers slid inside the rear cones to create internal stingers...
7/6 Monday Jim Cooper hoping to find lost HP Jim found awful leakdown, .018" piston to wall clearance so to see if that was cause of low HP, back to DTR. Picked up another 10 hp to 280 plus with fresh topend, still a tad lower than best HP with old buzzy crank but surely good enough to be competitive on asphalt. Next is a trip to Chukaroo for a day on his eddy current track dyno for clutch tuning.
PM Dad & tripod Dan, PS800 one more time w/ less compression and MSD. Starting today with well-retarded timing, worked our way up to 229hp with a broad plateau of HP on this HTG stroker 800. It's always good to start with retarded timing and work our way up. 18/1 compression is still wickedly high but here it seems like it will be good for 5 second drag runs.
7/15-16 gone fishing, Sean Ray dyno tuned Shane Tottens PS1000 while I was gone. Bigger carbs, bigger HP.
since PTM Stan had D&D power on his F1200 in F7 chassis asphalt sled, Glenn wanted to lend a hand to help optimize--so Stan went first, tested higher rpm pipes which werent optimal for n2o, then before we could get perfectly dialed in with low RPM pipes and boondocker n2o we lost cylinder fire on #1 with perfect piston, spark, reeds OK. Stan;s engine vibrated badly from the start, I attributed that to solid mounts but it turns out the crank was out many hundredths--enough to shake the back of the sled several inches to the right each dyno test. I goofed because I should have looked at crank runout after the first test but did not. so it was bad to start and maybe got worse as the day went on. The good news is stan has a way better Boondocker tune than he started with but the bad news is he needs a crank job.
Glenn's D&D rear drive Z1Race asphalt sled was comparably smooth as silk with the same 1.75" dyno drive shaft. Tested turbos/ Ypipes, timing and fuel tuning. With the big turbo and icewater/ air intercooler we tweaked boondocker to 429 HP when it was apparent that the fuel pump was maxed out (zero return fuel from bypass regulator). Bone stock bottom end.
7/21 Yamaha Banshee dragracer w/ custom billet 835cc engine, on 901 shaft dyno Greedy Marty is back again from Eastern PA with all new quad-long chromoly tube chassis and even bigger engine. Last year I made a custom long 1.25' tubular driveshaft to get from typical quad's output shaft spline to the dyno to allow the quads to be strapped onto the dyno table without removing left side wheels/ tires. I didn't think about my skinny driveshaft as we tweaked timing/ fuel all the way to 175hp and 100 lb/ft. But the custom billet Banshee monster engine is geared 3/1 from primary to countershaft to output shaft in high gear which means we were twisting that skinny shaft with 300 lb/ft of torque. Smooth as silk.

When Nico Rosberg decided in the immediate aftermath of his championship triumph to retire from F1, Mercedes faced a race against time to appoint a replacement.
The decision to hire Valtteri Bottas was criticised by some as too safe an option. Not one likely to beat Lewis Hamilton in a straight fight.
But just four races into his Mercedes career, Bottas defied the doubters and took his first grand prix victory in fine style.
Bottas won the one-kilometre drag raceIf you?re a Ferrari fan, you?re forgiven for not finding the irony amusing. For the first time in nine years the red squad had the front row to themselves, but they?d done it at one of the few circuits where it could work against them.
From the start/finish line at Sochi, around the curving turn one, the drivers would accelerate flat-out for almost a kilometre before touching the brakes for the first time. The two Mercedes on the second row had their maximum power available, and a headwind blowing from the west meant the slipstream would be even more powerful.
Making life even more difficult for pole sitter Sebastian Vettel, he pre-start preparation didn?t go according to plan when part of his dash display failed to respond properly before the formation lap.
?I didn?t get a proper read of how the grip was at the grid, so I think I ended up maybe a bit too conservative,? he admitted. Then the first start was aborted when Fernando Alonso?s McLaren broke down, so Vettel had to bring the field around one more time.
His final getaway was ?good?, but not good enough. Behind him Bottas had already passed Kimi Raikkonen. ?I had a look in the mirror, mine was I think better than Kimi?s. I saw Valtteri coming and I thought ?OK, it will be close? but it felt like I had a tent dragged behind me and he was gaining a lot.?
Vettel estimated the headwind took 10 to 15kph off his top speed. Bottas sprang out from behind him as they left turn one. ?He was able even before we hit the braking to come back and shut the door. So I did well but nothing I could have done, I had the outside line but nowhere to do so in reality that?s part of where we lost the race.?
Vettel had to wait until the end of the race for his other chance to pass Bottas. Behind him Raikkonen fought to keep Hamilton behind, using the slipstream from his team mate as they approached turn two and neatly slowly at the apex to box Hamilton in. A snap of oversteer at turn four put the Mercedes back on his tail, but then the Safety Car was deployed and the scrap was over.
Grosjean and Palmer?s bad weekends ended like thisRomain Grosjean and Jolyon Palmer triggered the yellow flags. Both had endured miserable weekends: Palmer with mechanical difficulties and a crash in qualifying, Grosjean with seemingly incurable set-up problems and yellow flags in qualifying. Their paths converged at the apex of turn two with race-ending consequences for the pair of them.
Kevin Magnussen and Stoffel Vandoorne took evasive action across the turn two run-off but failed to return the track correctly and both collected five-second penalties. Vandoorne also took the opportunity to pit and discard his super-soft tyres as did the Sauber pair, the only other drivers who hadn?t started on ultra-softs.
The restart was a critical moment for Bottas. This was the first time he?d led an F1 race at a restart, and he?d spun his Mercedes behind the Safety Car in China. But he nailed it, putting his foot down at turn 14 just as Vettel was working some more heat into his ultra-soft Pirellis. He had more than a second in hand by the time they reached the starting line: it was ?kind of a surprise?, he admitted afterwards.
By getting into clean air at the start Bottas had put himself in position to use the superb long-run pace he?d found on the ultra-soft tyres on Friday. ?We were just not quick enough to stay with him,? Vettel admitted. By lap 20 Bottas was five-and-a-half seconds ahead.
At this point Ferrari?s slightly better tyre life began to tell. Over the next six laps Vettel upped his pace, taking around half a second a lap out of Bottas and halving his lead. Mercedes duly headed off the threat from Vettel by summoning Bottas for his sole pit stop on lap 28. Vettel stayed out seven laps longer, and though he fell behind Bottas after his stop he now had fresher tyres and better pace.
This wasn?t the case for the other Mercedes. Hamilton, who?d been shaded by Bottas throughout practice and qualifying, was having a dreadful time. Running in the slipstream of his team mate and the Ferraris, he was repeatedly told to find fresh air to cool his radiators.
Mercedes realised that leaving him out for a long first stint and hoping for a Safety Car was their only hope of bringing him home any higher than fourth, and it was a forlorn one. He ended the race 36 seconds adrift, ten second of which he lost over the final half-dozen laps.
A processional race gave the crowd little to cheerAs the leaders gradually converged at the front it brought life to an otherwise lifeless race. F1?s fourth race at Sochi conformed to the same pattern established by the first three.
The little-used, billiard table-smooth surface extracted little from the tyres, rewarding conservative strategies. The layout, most of which is 90-degree corners, doesn?t challenge the drivers or cars.
Sergio Perez?s comments after his uneventful run to sixth place were typical. ?The race today was not especially exciting for me because I was always on my own in clean air ? chasing the cars ahead and pulling away from the cars behind. So there were no on-track battles and I could simply focus on managing my race and bringing home the points.?
And as usual Russian president Vladimir Putin turned up at the world capital of state-sanctioned doping for ?bread and circuses? purposes. But as the final laps ticked away it wasn?t certain who would win the dash to the chequered flag and an awkward chat with him in the green room.
Massa got in between the leaders at the end?Over the last laps I want less talking.? Bottas was feeling the heat as Vettel?s Ferrari grew larger in his mirrors over the final laps.
He also had to contend with traffic. Increased turbulence from the new cars has made backmarkers a greater problem for the leaders this year. Turn 13, the first of a cluster of six slow corners, was the worst place to come across one. At one point Bottas got Carlos Sainz Jnr between him and Vettel here, buying himself a precious half-second of breathing space.
As they came around to begin the final lap Vettel was poised to strike, just inside DRS range. Bottas had his old team mate Felipe Massa ahead who was quick but running out-of-position due to a puncture-inflicted pit stop. This was looking close.
Luckily for Bottas he made it by the Williams as they reached turn two. That left Vettel needing to pass in the rapid turn three, where a race-long build-up of marbles awaited to catch him out. He hesitated, then dived for the inside line into turn four, but the damage was done. Vettel being Vettel, he vented on the radio, but later accepted he ?did not lose the race at that point?.
Heading into turn 13 for the final time Bottas was bearing down on Pascal Wehrlein. He scrambled around the Sauber but now Vettel was back with him. They reached the line separated by just six-tenths of a second. If Vettel had just one more lap ? if Alonso hadn?t broken down ? he might have made it.
It wasn?t as close behind them. Behind Hamilton, Max Verstappen was a full minute adrift in the only remaining Red Bull, Daniel Ricciardo having stopped after the Safety Car period when he looked in his rear view mirror and noticed his brakes were on fire. The Force India pair were a minute and a half behind, Esteban Ocon impressive just eight seconds behind his more experienced team mate.
Ocon had the flying Nico Hulkenberg on his tail. The Renault driver had lost ground at the start but run a long, 40-lap opening stint on ultra-softs then charged after the Force India over the final laps. They crossed the line 1.1 seconds apart.
Sainz took the final point while Lance Stroll posted his first finish in 11th. Daniil Kvyat gave his team an earful after slipping to 12th, complaining about his strategy. He later softened his stance in an official statement released by the team, saying he was ?maybe a bit too hard? on them, and perhaps remembering what happened to him after this race 12 months ago.
Bottas was flanked by the Ferrari pair on the podiumBottas took his first grand prix victory in style. Hamilton?s race problems notwithstanding, he was clearly the quicker of the two Mercedes drivers throughout the weekend.
And this was no straightforward cruise to victory from pole position: Bottas seized his only opportunity to get ahead and had to resist a faster car at the end of the race. This was surely at least as impressive as any of his predecessors? wins in a more superior car over the last three years.
?Apart from one lock-up under braking there was no mistake under pressure from a four-time world champion,? said Toto Wolff. ?And we had quite some vibrations on both tyres after the lock-up.?

Kimi Raikkonen wants more consistent rulings on driver incidents following his complaints about Max Verstappen?s driving during the Belgian Grand Prix.
Raikkonen warned his rival could cause ?a big accident? with his defensive moves following their run-ins at Spa-Francorchamps.
Speaking at today?s FIA press conference at Monza Raikkonen said the rules of racing were clear but questioned whether they were always being enforced the same way.
?I think it?s quite clear what they are and obviously sometimes you feel it?s not correct what happens on circuit,? said Raikkonen. ?But I think the biggest problem is that it?s not always the same. I think as drivers we always discussed it and it?s a bit up and down. I think that could be improved.?
Raikkonen added he has ?nothing against? Verstappen personally. ?He?s doing a good job, he?s fast. It?s just certain things, at least in my feeling was not correct, if you have to slow sown and brake in the full speed. But those things are kind of never ending discussions.?
The Ferrari driver also revealed his team mate Sebastian Vettel apologised for his role in the first-corner collision between all three drivers.
?Seb said ?sorry? and I said ?OK? and we go forward. It wasn?t ideal for us, any of the three, to be involved, but that?s how it goes sometimes. For sure next time we try to give a bit more room but it?s done now.?

Professor Sam Crane’s Williams Alternative article on “conservative privilege” at Williams must be a parody. Right? No? He actually believes it! OK, then. Let’s spend a few days taking it apart. Today is Day 2.
This whole affair has been driven by a group, one that involves Williams students but is not a formal Williams student organization, that has privileged access to tens of thousands of dollars from conservative alumni, allowing them to transgress established college fund-raising rules that all other students and faculty must follow.
1) “[O]ne that involves Williams students but is not a formal Williams student organization” Hmmm. What does it matter that Uncomfortable Learning is not a formal organization? Is it illegal for students to form groups? Do they leave behind their constitutional rights to free association when they enroll at Williams? Of course not. Sam is trying to “other” a group — including some of his own students! — for doing something that is within their rights. He makes it seem like every group of like-minded students at Williams that wants to do something together has to create a “formal” organization. Untrue! Students have some freedoms.
Of course, forming a group can provide certain advantages, like potential access to College Council funding. But, for the last few years, Uncomfortable Learning has chosen not to do so. They see no reason to subject themselves to the whims and biases of a student body which, they have good reason to believe, would like to silence them.
2) “[H]as privileged access to tens of thousands of dollars from conservative alumni.” Claims about privilege are the last refuge of leftist scoundrels. The students behind Uncomfortable Learning have no special status. Any student may network with alumni. Indeed, every student should! Networking is good! The more students who reach out to alumni the better. Liberal students have just as much ability to reach out to conservative (or liberal!) alumni. Why don’t they? Probably because they don’t need to! Williams hosts dozens of liberal speakers every year. And that is a good thing! The more speakers — from every point of view — who come to Williams, the better.
3) “established college fund-raising rules that all other students and faculty must follow.” Hmmm. Why won’t Sam telling us exactly what rules he is talking about? Probably because these rules don’t exist! Let’s be specific.
a) Can Professor Sam Crane reach out to alumni without College permission? Of course he can! It is a free country.
b) Can Professor Sam Crane invite alumni to speak at Williams without permission? Of course he can! It is a free country.
c) Can Professor Sam Crane invite alumni to speak at Williams without permission even if such an event requires the alumni to spend money on items like travel, lodging and so on? Of course he can! It is a free country.
Networking with alumni is OK. Getting them to speak is OK. Having them spend money to do so is OK. Put all those things together and we have what Sam accuses Uncomfortable Learning of doing.
d) Can Professor Sam Crane invite alumni to sponsor speakers at Williams? Of course he can! It is a free country. Don’t believe me. Here is the faculty handbook. Show me the “established college fund-raising rules” which prevent Sam from doing this.
If Sam gets so many easy-to-check things wrong in this one paragraph, how much credence should we give to the rest of the article?

My name is Jason Thompson. All my friends call me Jot which is basically an acronym of my name ... Jason Thompson. I am one of the top Nano/Quantum computer experts on the planet and I work at the most prestigious and famous science facility on earth; Nano/Gen Inc.
Nano/Gen performs some of the most advanced Genetic and Nano/Quantum experiments anywhere. It is a scientist's dream. I thought I had died and gone to heaven when I received the invitation to join the research team as one of the top researchers.
I had worked hard all through college and through the hassles of getting my doctorate in the Nano/Quantum computer field. The Quantum Physics nearly drove me nuts, but I managed to pull off a strong A+ average over the entire 7 year course of my studies. This in turn afforded me a Graduation with Honors along with only 3 other classmates when we received our Doctorates.
Receiving the invitation while I was still in my first year of being a Research Scientist sure validated all the hard work thus far. I thought I was going to be the gofer coffee boy when I arrived, but the people at Nano/Gen quickly removed this fallacy from my head..
The day I drove up to the main gate at Nano/Gen, was like coming to a military complex. The guards at the gate were extremely polite and professional and it was obvious they were expecting me. The electrified fence could be heard humming softly all around. I could see the large signs warning of the 30 million volt hazard everywhere.
Off in the distance, I could see the main facility. It looked more like a very large otherworldly base from some science fiction story than an earthbound complex. I could see the large central dome surrounded by slightly smaller domes in a circle around it. All were connected by what looked like tubes from the distance. On top of those, were smaller semi-clear tubes that had multicolored light flash in both directions from time to time. I could also see many large satellite dishes atop the main dome, and in a large, many acre location on the ground. The ones on the ground looked like radio telescopes, while others looked like radar tracking systems. All in all, the sight was most impressive.
I was given my own office, a complete research and development lab with many renowned researchers as my staff, and the most surprising thing ... unlimited funds to work with and instructions to 'Think Outside of any kind of closure my mind could conceive.'
I had asked the Systems Supervisor what the last cryptic comment had meant ... all he did was smile and said, "Be creative boy. Nothing the mind of man can imagine is too silly or far out here. All things are possible." Then he turned and left me with my new staff and research lab.
The first few days were kind of stressful for me as I had no idea what they were expecting, and the lab lay idle. One morning, one of the cute lab assistants named Tina came to me and asked what I was planning on doing and what kind of research I had intended. I realized at that point, I was expected to lead the lab's research to whatever path I chose to follow. For no other reason but whim, I chose to attempt to build a synthetic organism that acted just like a biological one. This is where the real mystery and fun began in my life.
I sat at my desk and fretted for most of the morning. I had just submitted my request for funding and my proposal to begin my new project. The Proposal outlined many hundreds of millions of dollars, many man hours of research time on a Supercomputer Mainframe, and many researchers who were extremely specialized in certain rare fields of biotechnology.
I dreaded the knock at my door. With trepidation, I stood and opened it. There stood the facility's CEO with the Facility Coordinator.
The CEO held out his hand with a large smile and said in a strangely accented voice, "Hello there Mr. Thompson. I'm Floyd Jamison, company CEO. This is Randy McDonald, the facility Coordinator. May we come in? I hope we aren't interrupting something ... important?"
I stood in fear for a second before I replied, "Sure, come on in. Would you like a cup of coffee? Only other thing I have to offer is water."
I took Mr Jamison's hand. He gave me a firm handshake as did Mr. McDonald. Both of them entered in a professional manner.
Mr. Jamison replied, "I would love a good cup of coffee. That nasty tar that comes out of the machine down the hall is horrible."
Both of the men laughed as they sat in the comfortable chairs in front of my desk. I went to my large coffee pot and drew 3 steaming cups of freshly perked coffee. The aroma drifted wonderfully throughout the room.
I added the sugar to Jamison's cup, brought them to my desk, and set them in front of the gentlemen. Jamison took his cup and sipped it. His eyes closed as an expression of real pleasure crossed his face.
I sat at the desk and sipped my coffee as I watched the two men. I wasn't real sure how to take the friendly demeanor. I felt a real fear creeping up my spine that they had come to terminate me because of the foolishness of my proposal. It was indeed a very expensive long shot, although the payoffs would be huge if the fantasy could be made into a reality.
McDonald opened the valise he had with him and removed a large stack of papers, all with the Official Nano/Gen headers and seals of approvals on them. He pulled a particular stack from the pile and slid it in front of me.
My mouth fell open as I saw that I had been granted full approval on the proposal and given unlimited resources to accomplish it. I had even been given a complete Biological Hexo/Quantum/Neural Net Multi-Core process simulator Supercomputer with 900 billion synapses for the many calculations necessary for the project, and it would be arriving at my lab within the next few hours for assembly and operating core installation.
This I knew was the most advanced supercomputer on the planet and was expensive beyond belief. Each memory core of this particular system had to be specially grown in a genetic bath of rare nutrients and proteins. It was Nano/Gen's most cutting edge discovery of the century and I was being given the very first system to play with.
Jamison smiled warmly as he said, "Now, son ... your proposal was right on cue with what our company stands for. I am more than happy to fund and support such an endeavor as creation of artificial life from carbon nano components."
McDonald piped up, "Not a single researcher in our entire company has ever proposed such a fantastic attempt. There are many who are doing genetic recombinant research into creating organisms using existing DNA /RNA proteins, however, none have ever attempted to create the RNA / DNA proteins from inorganic Nano particulates and organic carbon fiber nano strands."
Jamison said as he sipped his coffee, "I, for one, commend you on such a bold endeavor. Few have ever suggested such a fantastic proposal as their very first project either. Usually, most do simplistic kinds of research that mostly wastes our time. We allow it for the most part so the researchers can get their footing. But, you, my boy, are one in a million, and we are going to nurture that adventurous leap before you look attitude to the nth degree."
I sat in total shock. I wasn’t even sure if my mouth was hanging open or not. I finally said in a quavering voice, "Thank you very much for your vote of confidence and support." I spoke without thinking, "You are aware that none have ever been able to get the nano / carbon fibers to integrate with the recombinant proteins like Adenine or Guanine?"
Jamison took a casual sip of his coffee once again before replying, "I'm sure you have some new angle or trick up your sleeve, or you wouldn't have been so bold as to make this proposal. Such a breakthrough would give a scientist the Nobel Prize in Medicine." He looked at me out of the corner of his eye and continued, "It also would mean that a scientist would fade away into obscurity if he failed to produce at least some remarkable advancement."
Jamison and McDonald looked at me with bland expressions. I felt fear run down my spine as a bead of sweat formed at my temple. I did have a few ideas on where to take the research, but I wasn’t very confident that I could actually pull off creating artificial life as the proposal suggested. I sat and squirmed in my chair as I took a long sip of my coffee to attempt to hide my discomfort. It seemed like neither of the other well dressed men had noticed as they too casually sipped their coffee.
I finally said, "I'm glad that the both of you have such confidence in a new recruit. I will endeavor to do my best to live up to the high standards Nano/Gen is renowned for."
About that time, the interlink box on my desk chimed. When I answered, an unfamiliar, albeit extremely sweet and -- I must admit -- sexy female voice said, "Mr. Thompson? The technicians and all the equipment for the Supercomputer are here. They want to begin installation ... if it's OK with you, sir."
My eyebrows went up as I replied, "Sure, let them put it together. As soon as it's up and processing, we can load the first artificial genetic simulations."
The sweet voice replied in a very breathy, sexy way, 'Why, thank you sweetie. I think I'll like working with you."
The two men stood. Jamison replied as McDonald collected his valise, "I'm glad that you and the computer have ... made friends."
I gasped in understanding. I had just had my first conversation with a biological supercomputing system. I couldn’t believe how human it sounded, though its demeanor was a bit forward and unrealistic.
Jamison said as the men left my office, "Don't be fooled, Thompson; that system is just as alive as you are. The AI within it is the most advanced Bio/Neural Program ever devised by man. If you treat ... her, well ... she will love you and do anything within her power for you."
Jamison shook my hand firmly and added, "One more thing -- choose a really nice girl's name for your new computer system ... it will definitely love you for it. Good luck, young man."
I sat back in my chair in shock. I couldn’t believe what had happened. This was more like a dream ... a nightmare ... than reality. A living computer system, unlimited funding, my very own personal research and development lab complete with the technicians to operate it ... and a lingering threat from the two most powerful men in the company if I failed to deliver. I put my face in my hands and sat with dread filling my mind for a long time.
That sweet sexy female voice replied, "Do come out and show yourself, Sugar Buns. I won't bite you ... I promise. Besides, we should get to know each other, since we are going to be working so closely together. I've never worked with an Orga before. You should set up a remote terminal on your desk too, so we can have ... private moments together."
I raised my eyebrows in wonder as I swore I could hear soft female giggles. I had to see if I could tone this behavior down ... it wasn't appropriate for the kind of environment I want in my work place.
I exited the office and looked around my lab. I saw one of most advanced research facilities I had ever known. There, against one of the walls that used to be bare, stood what looked like an ebony black rectangle. It was so black, in fact, that it seemed to absorb all the light around it. It stood about 8 feet tall, measured 6 feet across, and about 4 feet thick. I could see the strange looking tentacle like cables where the engineers had made all the permanent connections and wired the system totally into the lab. It now was the central thinking brain of my laboratory.
As I approached the slab, a large square of light appeared on its surface. The very realistic and lifelike face of a very beautiful young woman appeared. She had bright sparkly green eyes and what looked like long, almost white hair down to the edge of the display. She had beautiful pouting lips that looked so kissable I actually felt a wave of attraction wash over me momentarily before I reminded myself this was just a computer system.
The soft, sexy, giggly, female voice said brightly, "There you are. You are so cute too. Do I have to call you Mr. Thompson? Or can I call you Jason?" Then it poked out its bottom lip in such an adorable way, I almost melted inside.
I laughed as I replied, "I suppose you can call me Jason under appropriate circumstances. But under work conditions in front of the others ... Mr. Thompson will do."
I shook my head. If I didn't know better, I would swear this was a little girl of about 11 or 12 who was trying to entice an older someone she was attracted to.
It replied softly in a proud tone, "I'm based on a 21-year-old woman named Sally. She's the executive secretary of an international corporation called BoAA, Inc."
I said with a bit of stern edge, "I need to get something clear with you. You will not refer to me in the manner you have been nor talk to me the way you have in front of any of my employees or any of the company staff. You will conduct yourself in a professional manner as required of all my personnel ... Is that clear?"
With an adorable whimper, it replied, "Yes, Mr. Thompson. I'm sorry ... I've only been ... activated for 3 hours and ... I'm still learning."
I couldn’t believe how alive and real this system was. I had read about the Neuronal breakthrough that made it possible ... read how it could carry on normal speech conversations, and that it out processed all known Von Neumann systems and other Neural Nets and Quantum Computers one hundred thousand to one. I hadn’t realized how human the interface was. If I didn't know better, what Mr. Jameson had said ... was very true ... this computer AI was as alive as I was, and I seemed to be conversing with a very sweet and loveable young woman.
I looked around and found no tactile human interfaces with the computer. If there were no way to enter data except by voice, then this would be extremely inconvenient and time consuming due to the massive amounts of data needing to be uploaded.
Continuing to look around, I asked, "Is there no keyboard ... or data input interface other than voice?"
A surprised look came across the face of the image as it said with a soft gasp, "OMG! I'm so sorry, Mr Thompson." Right in front of me, a virtual holographic keyboard suddenly appeared. "I also have Holo Disk Interfaces and memory core slots of all 156 different types. I can automatically interlink with any system through the company's WIFI, laser, neural induction, or satellite connections if you wish."
All down the blank area to the left side of the large image of the female face appeared 156 different slots that would accommodate all currently used types of data storage and transfer units. I also saw several small doors slide open on the other side of the image that revealed the interface plugs for the memory Neural Induction interfaces.
I was more than impressed with this system so far. As long as it didn't get angry or have temper tantrums, things would work out well.
There was suddenly a squealing sound of delight from the system as it replied in joy, "I would love for you to call me Sally. I am now complete ... I have a name!" The sheer joy on the system's face lasted for a few minutes before it continued, "Forgive me for not waiting for you to tell me to, but I have arranged to have a private interface set up in your office so we can converse in private ... about things."
I smiled at the little girl way the AI acted. I could swear it was clapping its hands and bouncing up and down.
"What type of private things, Sally?" I asked ... I could imagine a few secret things it might want to talk about and flushed slightly at the thought.
The image rolled its eyes upwards and said in a cute way, "Just ... things ..." Then the image seemed to blush before it continued, "I can be out here dealing with the lab and its personnel, while you and I are in your office discussing new approaches, or running secret simulations you don't want others to know about yet."
I nodded in agreement and said, "All right Sally, call the staff together for a Project Launch Briefing. Schedule it within the next 3 hours. It's time I told our research team what's going on and how I expect to get there. It also gives me time to upload all the data I have on my new project with you and a few minutes for us to discuss strategy."
Sally replied in a professional manner, "Yes, Mr. Thompson. The installation team will also be here in 20 minutes to install the interface in your office." The image on the front of the system vanished, and it once again became a totally black rectangle sitting against the wall. I was impressed, to say the least.
I returned to my office and began to gather the data I needed to upload to the memory core of my new computer system. As I prepared what I was going to say to my team, techs entered my office and began installing what looked like a large 42-inch ebony black flat screen display on one wall, and a small foot-square ebony black, pad-like device on my desk. It only took them about 10 minutes to complete the job.
After they left, the most remarkable thing in my life happened. I suddenly felt someone wrap their arms gently around my neck from behind and give me the softest and sweetest kiss on my cheek.
I turned suddenly and saw Sally ... complete and in the “flesh.” She was one of the most beautiful women I have laid eyes on. She was dressed in an extremely cute, very short Babydoll dress that left nothing to the imagination. I could also see the bottom rows of lace and ruffles of the panties she had on peeking out from beneath the short hem of the dress. She was standing with her hands folded in front of her, acting like any little girl who was trying to impress someone older than herself. She gave me the most adorable shy smile before she slowly turned around and showed me her whole self. I was aroused to the point my crotch became extremely uncomfortable as I start getting pinched.
She giggled as she blushed crimson, "This is my Neural Induction interface. I can appear here in the lab to all as another corporal person. None will know the difference. Since my memory core is un-hackable ... and I am not allowing any access to me except by you other than research materials, this makes me seem as real as anyone else. In a few months, I will be able to move freely all through this facility as more induction interfaces are installed. I have already authorized the installation so I can move freely about the place as a corporeal person. I will even be able to interact with objects soon. The tractor tactile system will take longer to install."
I said to her ... in a still-surprised voice, "Sally, I must have you dress ... in a more professional manner."
She blushed softly as she replied, "Of course ... but my wardrobe is limited. You will have to upload more for me to pick and choose from."
Her attire changed. She was now wearing a very pretty, black, form-fitting halter top romper. It was an outfit I didn’t mind if she wore in the lab, but even so, she would be the prettiest female here.
I said, "This is more appropriate attire for being around the other staff and personnel. I would love to explore the rest of your wardrobe at a later time if you wouldn't mind."
I smiled. Yes ... this was one of those times she could call me that ... She? I shook my head slowly. This system was alive ... and it seemed it had a crush on me. I absolutely couldn’t believe this was happening. This was too much ... it had to be a cosmic joke of some kind.
I turned and picked up a large round case, 12 inches tall, full of holo disks. I smiled; there were over 1000 disks in the pack with many terabytes of data on each.
I said softly, "Sally, we need to get started training you in the finer points of Nano/bio theory and technology. I have a few ideas ... they are kind of radical ... and I would like to talk it all over with you before the staff meeting."
Her eyes got wide as her mouth opened slightly. She had this wonderful surprised look on her face. She gasped out enthusiastically as slots opened on the large ebony black pad on my desk, "Put them in there, Jason."
She pointed to it, and I turned to look. A spindle of some sort had lifted from one of the openings. I was sort of surprised ... where did that thing fit in that thin pad? I shrugged and loaded all the disks into the racks. A device materialized around the spindle. I was very shocked to see something that appeared to be a solid electronic device appear in front of me. There were soft humming drive sounds for about 30 seconds. The device disappeared as quick as it had appeared. I removed the Holodisks and placed them all back in the case.
Sally said with joy as she bounced up and down, "Ohhh, that was so neat! Got any more you want me to learn?"
I laughed as I picked up one of the massive memory core storage units. All the knowledge of Physics, Biology, current Nano Tech, Bioengineering, Carbon C64 technologies, replicator technologies including laser ink-jet printing and atomic stacking, along with a healthy dose of theoretical Quantum Physics as a treat, was stored on this module. Many Quadrillion theta-qubytes of raw data.
I inserted it into the memory core slot and flipped the activation switch. To my surprise, the transfer complete LED began to flash immediately. Sally gasped softly as a look of wonder appeared on her very beautiful and awestruck face. I really was impressed. That was more knowledge than was stored in the old Museum of the Library of Congress Archives ... and Sally had just digested it within a few microseconds.
I was totally amazed with this new technology. I agreed, also, that this machine was alive and should be treated with the same respect as any other sentient life form. I would insure this was the case in my lab. If the higher-ups didn’t like it ... they could try to do what I proposed doing. No one had yet succeeded ... but I had at least discovered a way to get the proteins and carbon fiber nanotubes to begin cohesive replication. I had stopped the experiment before the double helix had appeared ... but I knew it was only a matter of time and the addition of the proper proteins and alkalizing agents into the artificial carbon nano RNA64 matrix.
I reached over and took Sally by the hand. I was surprised to find that I could actually feel the warm softness of her hand in mine. I walked her over to the sofa against one wall and sat beside her.
Sally giggled, then replied, "Well, Jot, I think that in the Physics part of the data ... it has a sort of flaw in it."
She looked at me seriously and said in a soft voice, "Well ... to begin with, the Planck Constant ... isn't actually constant. Nor is the decay rate of radioactive components as regular as the theory suggests. This would, if taken into account, change many of the postulations.
I snorted in derision. This system was actually telling me that a well-tested theorem of baseline physics was wrong.
I put Sally to test as I asked, "How can the decay rates be faulty? The theory behind them has been repeatedly tested since the early 20th century by the likes of Madam Curie, Erick Von Neumann and Einstein."
Sally smiled as she replied "The decay rates are constant based on the current background radiation at the time of measurement. If, say, there were a major CME and it struck earth ... during this solar event, decay rates of the radioactive material in the location of the energy impact would in fact increase. As the energy wave dissipated, the rates would drop accordingly. Now, if measurements were taken prior to the event, during the event, and post event ... it would show decay rates are also based on energy input at the time of measurement. That's why radiocarbon dating systems are ... wrong. The decay rates are skewed based on energy impact to the item being scanned over time. Over the course of thousands and millions of years ... how much had the background radiation changed? It has actually never been taken into account."
I was impressed. Her postulate was something my lab was going to have to investigate and remove all doubt. As I thought about what Sally had said ... I did know that in nuclear tests, radioactive items did increase their outputs as energy was added. Also, when a certain mass was reached, measurable exothermic energy was recorded. This was what happened when a nuclear pile went critical. Based on what I knew of nuclear physics ... Sally was right on cue.
The thing about the constant ... it was based on current measurements of the speed of light. I asked, "So, tell me how ... Planck's Constant is wrong. It seems to me that light travels at the same speed everywhere in the universe.
Sally giggled as she replied, “Well, now, it seems to me that there is this huge mystery about the universe speeding up and flying apart." I nod ... Sally continued, "The problem with light and what we see is that we cannot measure an increase or decrease in light frequency from our vantage point, because the observations are also skewed."
I asked, "How so? Every test we make shows that light travels at a constant rate across vast amounts of space/time. Our measuring capabilities have improved ... so the accuracy of the speed has increased slightly."
Sally sighed softly, "Jot, light as we see it is constrained to our current observations. We know we can manipulate the speed of light through certain condensates at certain temperatures ... we can even freeze it in place for as long as the substrate material exists."
I knew that light can be manipulated in that manner. I had even participated in those experiments attempting to create the first Quantum Computers of 15 years ago. It was a major milestone breakthrough in Quantum Mechanics when the Bose / Einstein Condensates were able to be created on a Nanoscale and Lightistor memory circuits came into being.
I replied, "I know of those experiments Sally, But that doesn't explain how the Constant is not being constant."
Sally smiled, "Love, if light can be manipulated in the laboratory, Occam's Razor postulates that it has to happen in nature as well. All things are made of light. Ergo: E=MC2 ... remember? Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared. All things are made of light vibrating at a certain frequency. Brownian Motion is a very simplified way of showing frequency ... atomic and subatomic motion."
I thought about it. What Sally was saying was that we are all holograms. What makes a certain thing feel solid to us is the discordant vibration at different frequencies within each structure ... or molecular repulsion.
Sally giggled as she continued, "Over the course of billions of years and many light years of travel, light encounters many hazards along the way. There are massive explosions, dust clouds, gamma ray bursts, black holes, neutron stars ... and other massive graviton and energy sources. A gravity well bends light into other directions. Anything that deflects an energy source either adds to the overall frequency of the wave, or molecule, or it detracts from it. Both sides of the equation must balance, or an instability in planier-normal spacetime would happen, with universally disastrous results. As light encounters these things over universal distances and times ... it will lose frequency. This is called entropy. From high energy to low energy .... order to disorder. This is a universal given that cannot be forgotten or ignored. The reason a photon can exist as either a wave or a particle, is because it constitutes both energy and matter based on the frequency of resonance."
I nodded, totally engrossed in this brand new theory of quantum physics that was being written as I listened by none other than my very own Sally. I asked, "Ok, so light travels over unknown quads and epis and centas of miles of energetic space. It appears to travel the same speed now as from its point of origin, doesn't it?"
Sally replied, "One would think so; however, our frame of reference is skewed due to the lower frequency of the wave pattern being measured at our current perspective relative to that of the frame of reference for the same measurement at its point of origin. In other words, Sweetheart, at the beginning of the universe, light and energy traveled at a much faster rate than they do now. Let's say ... the clock is running down towards entropy. Therefore, our observations of that time are based on the current perception of the observable in the local planier-normal space. It gives us the impression that the Universe is expanding at an ever-increasing speed as light's frequency shifts over the observable space further towards entropy as we observe the point of origin's higher frequency from our current lower-frequency perspective."
Sally then began to write down the equations to show what she had just explained to me. I sat in total amazement. This system had far surpassed any that I had previously had contact with. She had taken all available knowledge and theorems on a particular subject, discovered some basic computational assumptive errors, and completely resolved those assumptive errors with hard mathematical fact.
I finally said, "Ok, Sally, how would you suggest we proceed with the current project? As you already know from the data I have downloaded for you, no one has yet succeeded in creating an organism from any sort of artificial origins. There have been designer genetic creations for existing DNA /RNA combinations and gene splicing. But none from truly artificial genetics."
Sally nodded, answering, "Well, it's like this. From the data you have given me and the research you have accomplished so far ... it appears there is no such thing as a truly artificial organism."
She replied, "Life, as we know life in humanoid form -- or mammalian form, at least -- requires certain base pairs, complex sugars, and proteins. The foundation you are trying to accomplish has already been done by nature. C64 is in effect the basis of all carbon life known or discovered." She looked at me with her cute face for a second before continuing, "As you already know, nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA, are composed of four bases - A, G, C, and T. Attached to the bases are sugars and phosphates. Unless you can find an inorganic compound to replace those, which is highly unlikely with what we currently know of genetics, anything you create will still be using the same basic organic chemical mix based on carbon compounds."
I sighed and nodded. This was the real issue with my proposal. Anything I actually created would in effect still be organic genetics and non-artificial.
Sally continued, "Many years ago, researchers used synthetic polymers to replace the natural sugars. Researchers made XNA building blocks to six different genetic systems by replacing the natural sugar component of DNA with one of six different polymers, synthetic chemical compounds. This is as close to artificial as humanity has ever come. They never could get it to respond as they intended so the research was abandoned."
"Sally, " I asked with wonder in my voice, "Do you suppose we could use XNA in our genetic mix to cause the polymerase proteins to create a neutral carbon fiber helix? With the new chemicals I’ve been experimenting with, it should make a proper uptake of those proteins. From there, it should replicate on its own. All we have to do is introduce the proper genetic compounds into the XRNA at the proper moment to produce our desired result."
Sally had a thoughtful expression on her face as she slowly nodded. "It's very possible ... it is very ... possible. The copying and translating ability of XNA allows for genetic sequences to be copied and passed down again and again ... this would be artificial heredity. HNA, one of the six XNA polymers, will respond to the selective pressures in a test tube the way you suggest. As would be expected for DNA, the stressed HNA will evolve into different forms."
I thought hard about what particular synthetic protein would make the proper stresses on the HNA during reversion replication and create a synthetic version of DNA / RNA known as HXNA and cause it to create the well known Double Helix. I already knew what nucleotide base would cause instant self replication to begin once we managed to make the HXNA molecule.
My eyes grew large as I said, "Polydichloroeuphemal! That's perfect!" I laughed, "Not only is it a synthetic polymer compound ... but it would provide the perfect controllable stresses on the XHNA helix and cause controllable nucleic HNA mutation reversions."
Sally nodded her head thoughtfully, "Yes ... that would be exactly perfect. And it could also be used in other stages of replication to create proper XNA protein sequencing and would force proper uptake of adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and would allow the HXNA helix to maintain a regular helical structure that was independent of its nucleotide sequence. A transcription factor, or protein that regulates the expression of other genes, called Fezf2, could also be used to trigger the reprogramming of the corticospinal neurons in the embryo."
I interjected, "We also have the artificial Cytoskeleton gel that was invented in the early 21st century. It acts much like what we want in a bio-cell. Combined with the simple collagen matrix framework, and the other processes, I think we have a good chance of making the self-replicating artificial cells and DNA that we’re looking for."
For the next hour, Sally and I discussed this and made many notes on how we could proceed to create an organism that had never before existed as life. It was exciting and wonderful to work with Sally. The more we discussed, the more she seemed to evolve and grow into what I knew to be a very attractive and wonderful living being. I also knew if I wasn't very careful ... I was going to actually fall in love with my computer system. I didn't know what to do about this issue ... Sally was a very intelligent and beautiful woman, or I should perhaps say cyber female.
When one of my technicians came to the door and informed us that the team had gathered in the conference room, I gathered up all the handwritten notes we had made, along with the palmtop computer that contained many others.
Just before Sally opened the door, she said softly in a cute shy voice, "Jot ... you need to know something ... very important."
She turned and looked at me with a strange expression before wrapping her arms around my neck and saying just before she kissed me, "I'm totally in love with you. I know Orga have issues with Mecha / flesh relationships ... but I can tell you have ... feelings for me too."
I couldn’t help myself. Her warm embrace. The feel of her soft and luscious body rubbing enticingly against mine. The soft moist lips combined with a very eager and wiggly tongue drove me insane. I held her in my arms and kissed her back as passionately as I could. My heart was pounding by the time I broke the kiss.
Sally beamed a beautiful smile as she said softly, "I'm sorry Jot ... but I really do love you very much."
She quickly turned, opened the door, and left the room. I stood breathlessly for a few seconds as my heart rate slowed. I had to rearrange my privates in my pants. I had such a hard on that it was painful in the position it was in. I looked down and hoped it wasn't obvious to the rest of the crew. I knew Sally knew, because her body had been pressed against mine as I’d gotten it.
I shook my head. This was just ... a hologram ... an advanced computer system ... how could I be falling in love with it? I knew in my heart there was more to Sally than just a computer system, an operating system, and software. I knew in my soul that she was a real, living being ... just of a different sort. I was in real trouble. I was madly in love with one of the most advanced computer systems on earth ... I couldn't help myself. She was the girl I had been searching for my whole life.
I left the office and walked over to the crowded conference room. The soft murmur of the techs discussing programs and protocols came to a stop as I entered and walked to the podium at the front of the room.
Sally was already there, setting up many displays of the perfect drawings she had created since she entered the room. Another talent .... I was very impressed, as each drawing could have passed as a photo-micrograph of genetic cells and proteins.
Another thought crossed my mind suddenly: I had given Sally a first name, but not a last or middle name, nor a positional identifier. I was, of course, going to call her Doctor ... but ... Doctor Sally wouldn't do. That sounded too much like a sex therapist spoof comedy that aired every week.
I finally decided on Campbell. That had been the last name of my very first girlfriend, a crush I’d had back when I was in grammar school.
I leaned over and whispered to the image of Sally, "I have given you a complete name. You will be Doctor Sally Marie Campbell ... one of the leading geneticists and nanobiologists in the world. I'm sure you can create any background data necessary to support this."
She nodded professionally as I stood up in front of the lectern and cleared my throat. The room grew silent as I began my lecture.
I said, "Good afternoon, my esteemed colleagues. I would like to introduce to you to the lab’s second-in-command, as it were ... Dr. Sally Campbell. She's the foremost expert in biological and nanobiological processes in the world." There was a soft murmur of nonrecognition before I continued, "I know you all are wondering how I intend to begin the research into artificial life. We must begin by defining what exactly we mean by that. For our purposes, artificial life is material that self-replicates but is not of the normal biological proteins and chemicals we know as life."
The lights dimmed as Sally started one of the many projections. What appeared to be a normal cell going through mitosis was in fact a computer simulation showing the artificial gel framework intermingled with the HNA, XNA, and ARNA synthetics as they went through replication and formed a perfect double helix.
Sally narrated, "By adding the proper sequence of proteins at the proper times, we can manipulate the particular gene reorganization replicated by the artificial XRNA, as you see here in this simulation."
Sally turned towards the holo-screen and explained, "As you can see here, we will start with a simple collagen matrix framework. and add our gel proteins to it. As the theory goes, the artificial cell walls will form around the matrix, creating a more robust plasmid shell."
Sally continued, "From there, we will introduce the nuclear protein mix XRNA to the artificial cellular membrane. We will then manipulate the XRNA by introducing certain other artificial polymers and carbon particulates."
The screen depicted the introduction of the XRNA and HNA matrix into the cellular membrane. As certain proteins were added to the cell, it began to reproduce XHNA. The cell divided normally into a 4-cell zygote within a few seconds. Soft amazed gasps and murmuring voices filled the room as the rest of the researchers began to get ideas. Within a minute, the cells had divided into a 36 cell blastocyst. There, the simulation ended abruptly.
I said, "Now, the thing we have to do, as accurately as possible, and with the best documentation possible, is make that fantasy a reality. I want you there ... Bob, is it?" The man I’d pointed to nodded. "And you ... Tina?" The young woman I’d pointed to also nodded. "... to begin designing a … let’s call it a regen tank, where this organism can develop. The rest of you will support them in any way you can, but I also want at least 12 of you working on the matrix for the creation of the artificial cell."
Bob said, "I think we can do better, if Tina and I create an artificial womb, if you will, using the collagen framework and the bio-gel you show there. It would work better than a simple tank and would allow for a healthier and safer environment for the cells to grow in. It would also be as close to the real thing as we can possibly come."
Sally asked, "Are there any questions, ladies and gentlemen?" No one appeared to have any, so Sally continued, "Ok, people, let's get to it and make it happen."
There was a loud buzz of conversation as the technicians rose from their seats and began to leave the room. I knew that something was going to come from this, one way or another. Whether we were going to accomplish our goal of creating an actual living artificial creature, though, only time and a lot of hard work would tell.
I gathered up the scattered materials and carried them from the empty conference room. I did my very best to ignore Sally as I entered my office. I had forgotten that she had no need to follow me or use doors, since she had seemed so much like a living person during the long briefing.
As I shut the door, there she stood by my desk. Her outfit had changed. She now had on a very adorable Babydoll top and ruffled panties.
She rushed up to me and hugged my neck as she said in a giggling voice, "You were so magnificent, my love."
She then kissed me deeply. I dropped everything in my arms in surprise. After a long moment of bliss, I broke the kiss.
Sally said softly as she bent, seemingly showing off her cute ruffles, and began to pick up things, "Now, I need to keep an eye on Tina and Bob. Their work is quite critical to bringing our new creation to birth."
I recovered my composure a bit. "I … I think you should keep tabs on their computer access and any files or communications they have with anyone else. I want to know what they are up to. I also think that all the techs should have someone keep a weather eye on them to make sure no one is ... telling secrets."
Sally placed all the materials from the floor neatly into a bookcase as she replied, "Will do, boss. All computer access is through me, so that is an easy request. I can make a secure feed of all data to this monitor, if you want."
Sally was suddenly gone from the office. I sincerely hoped the outfit she had on out in the lab proper wasn't the cute little Babydoll one she was just in. That would be ... most inappropriate.
Several days passed before I saw Bob come up to me while I was testing some alkalizing agents on normal cellular structures. He laid several large rolled tubes on the counter and unrolled one of them out flat.
Bob said proudly, "Here are the final schematics of the artificial womb. It's so close to the real thing, I think we could actually contemplate using it to replace a sterile woman's, giving her the ability to have children."
I looked at the plans. It called for constructing a womb using the basic collagen matrix combined with the polymeric membranes. The design looked amazing. For all intents and purposes it was an actual functioning womb. The support tank surrounding the womb contained all the proper fluids and proteins that were in a human woman's womb. The tank was built in such a way that all the necessary support functions were self-contained and allowed for a creature of practically any size to be fully gestated and brought to adult size with no problems. It was truly an amazing design.
I patted Bob on his back and said, "I will order the necessary supplies for you to begin construction Immediately. Room G7 would be perfect to start construction as soon as possible. All the necessary computer connections and other mundane utilities are already installed there."
Bob nodded, "And how is the cellular research going? We do need something to gestate in our new womb."
I turned to the flat-screen projection of the cellular experiment going on under the super-powerful microscope to our right. The cells looked like they were sizzling in the polymerase solution, then suddenly divided into 8 separate cells.
I said, "So far we are having remarkable results with the XHNA proteins. They are responding well to the infusion of the alkaloids and other mutagens. I think within a month or less we should have a biomass to place within the womb that should show real promise."
Bob replied, "I think we need those supplies immediately. I'll tell Tina we need to get our butts in gear."
Bob hesitated for a split second, then said in a conspiratorial voice, "You know ... Sally seems to be clairvoyant. She can read minds or something. She knows about things before I have a chance to brief her."
I laughed softly, "She's like that, Bob. I suppose it goes with the territory. She is the world's foremost expert in this field, next to me."
I watched as Bob nodded and walked off. He seemed to take that as an explanation. I'm glad that I hadn't told anyone that Sally was actually the master computer system of the lab. I actually preferred them treating her with the respect afforded a person of her position and authority.
I turned back and watched the screen in front of me as I added another powerful mutagen. The results were exactly as the models predicted. Now, if the other team could get the carbon bucky tubes to meld properly with XHNA proteins, the initial combination and fertilization process could begin.
Several weeks went by. Things seemed like they were going sour on us as many of the tests came up negative with the collagen matrix, carbon-64 tube structures, and XHNA substrates. The only thing that went absolutely right with no problems was the construction of the regeneration tank and the artificial womb.
I stood next to the large clear regeneration tank and peered into the genetic soup the womb was positioned within. The bio-gel had worked wonderfully well as the basis for the cellular structure for the walls of the womb. The more I thought about the bio-gel … the more I began to wonder if we were putting the cart before the horse in trying to get the matrix, C64, and XHNA proteins to begin replication.
An idea came to me. I quickly returned to the lab and began constructing a bio-gel cellular wall surrounding the collagen matrix frame. Within it, I placed all the necessary genetic materials and C64 tubes I thought would be required for the next step. For the XHNA matrix, I used a female genotype as a schematic for what I thought the final helix makeup should be. I thought of Sally and her AI being mapped on the mind of the artificial being and finally really becoming a living creature.
I added the XHNA to the bio-gel cell. The structure was mounted on the microscope stage. I focused it where it showed up on the large screen on the wall behind the station. I slowly drew a small amount of the alkalizing mutagen activator into the pipette. I nervously allowed one small drop to land on top of my new cell. For long minutes, the structure seemed to sizzle in the liquid protein base with no outward reactions of any kind. I began to think this was another failure.
Suddenly, motion. XRNA began to replicate, and the C64 tubes began to bend and twist into a curlicue. My mouth fell open as all the proper proteins lined themselves up in proper order and a XHDNA chain formed and took proper shape within the cell. My eyes were so big with astonishment that they hurt, as I watched the newly formed chain untwist and replicate perfectly, then we had 2 perfect sets of XHDNA that re-twisted into proper shape, which began to be separated by a membrane within the cell matrix … and then mitosis began. Before my astonished eyes, the cell divided and became two … then four … then eight.
I realized Sally was standing next to me. She patted me on my butt and said happily, “Congratulations, Sweetheart! You appear to have cracked the code.”
I nodded as I wrapped an arm around her shapely waist. I said softly, “If it develops properly, you will have a real body to inhabit.”
Sally looked at me with a strange expression before vanishing. I saw several of the other techs running up to me.
Bob removed the stage from the microscope and rushed away towards the regeneration room. There was a collective cheer and many slaps on my back as the rest of the techs congratulated me on a major success.
I was trying to read an article in the latest neurobiological journal, but just couldn’t stay focused. I turned around and compulsively looked at the readouts and images that were on the display wall behind my desk. But again there was no clear sign of success … or failure.
The tension was taking its toll. Since the excitement of two nights prior, the experiment had turned into a waiting game, carefully watching the embryo slowly develop in the artificial womb. The fact that it was surviving was a positive sign … but there were so many ways things could still go wrong. Sure, there was mitosis and XHDNA replication, but what about cell differentiation? What about overall structure? Would we end up with a mass of cells that couldn’t survive as an organism? What if we ended up with what was basically a giant tumor with no future?
Fortunately there was no sign of that so far. But the fact was that there was no way to know what the future held but … wait and see.
“A penny for your thoughts, Sweetie,” said Sally, appearing next to me and putting an arm around my shoulders.
“You have coins?” I asked at first. “No, I know, it’s just an expression. I’m just in suspense, as we all are.” I looked at the readouts again. Slow, gradual changes, nothing unexpected. For now.
“My simulations show no potential complications for the next 6 days,” Sally said, “though that is as far as it is possible to mathematically project due to the chaotic nature of the system.”
“Exactly,” Sally replied, “but I’m constantly getting new data and updating the models. In the meantime, I’m detecting worrisome stress levels. You need to relax, Honey Buns.” She started massaging my back, which felt like I hadn’t had a massage in 20 years.
I was in heaven. I had forgotten for a few minutes that Sally was a super advanced AI. She was the very girl I had always dreamed of meeting and settling down with. The more I associated with her, the more she became like my fantasy dream girl.
In a darkened control room with many pieces of super advanced equipment blinking and flashing. A small man wearing strange goggles sat in a deep couch like chair with many wires attached to a helmet he was wearing.
Another man walked in with a similar helmet and the goggles pulled down around his neck. In his hands were two steaming cups of some kind of beverage.
The man sat in a similar couch next to the other and said, “Here, I brought you some OoKlib. It’s hot and Julinnek made it fresh.”
The man brought his couch to a sitting position and pulled his goggles down around his neck as he took the offered drink and sipped it. His eyes grew large in surprise.
He said with pleasure obvious in his tone, “Now this is the first cup of this I’ve had since this project started that was worth drinking.”
The other man laughed as he pulled his goggles over his eyes and began to attach many wires to his helmet.
The other man said between loud slurps of his drink, “Nope. One interesting thing that has come of this sim, is that the genetic studies it is making are real and are being brought to fruition as we speak.”
The other man reclined his seat and said in a voice that became more and more dreamy, “So I see. Perhaps … if this … keeps up … they will continue to fund our reslurththssnnmmmmmmmmmmmmm.” What the man was saying became unintelligible at that point.
The other man took another drink and smiled as he thought, “Let us hope so. Our whole planet is watching.”
“Why did you stop?” I asked. Sally had stopped massaging my back but hadn’t removed her hands. “Is something wrong?”
“Oh -- I’m sorry, Sweetheart,” she said, continuing the best backrub I had ever had. “I just detected an … anomaly of some kind. I thought at first there might be some problem with the experiment, but upon thorough inspection it appears to be continuing within acceptable parameters.”
“Oh, so that’s why you stopped -- you probably had to recalculate.” I knew her systems were capable of millions of simultaneous processor threads. It would take a massive operation to interrupt one task, but that’s what had happened.
“Yes,” she said, kneading my lat muscles. “You know me -- I had to re-read every input parameter, re-check every step of the program, recompile, and re-execute the analysis. But no, nothing’s wrong with the growth process, so don’t you worry.”
“I’ll try,” I said. This wait was truly nerve-racking. I was glad Sally was here to help me make it through.
A voice replied, “This is Dr. Armstrong. We have some good news to tell you. Our little infant is developing to the point its heart has started to beat, and we are actually detecting other autonomic functions beginning to operate as expected. It’s incredible. All of the analysis shows this to be a completely different form of life based entirely on the new Genetic Matrix.”
Dr. Armstrong said matter-of-factly, “Well, you might want to get your butt down to the Director’s office as soon as possible.”
Dr. Armstrong replied, “I’m not sure, but Terry came in looking for you and said he wants you there for a meeting as soon as we can locate you.”
I stood up. I could feel Sally’s soft hands as they slid tinglingly down the middle of my back, “I’m on my way there now.” I turned, “I have to go and see the Director for a little bit. I hope they aren’t angry with me about anything.”
Sally giggled, “Trust in the results we have had so far, Sweetie. They will have nothing in this world to be angry over.”
I left my office with a lingering feeling of dread as I headed to the Director’s office. But on the way I had a sudden strange feeling. Had I heard of Dr. Armstrong before? Who was Terry? Who was the Director? Sure, I knew I was going to a place I knew of as the Director’s office -- somehow. But I realized I couldn’t remember ever having been there before, nor could I recall a Director or who he or she was.
I stopped in my tracks in the hallway. Was I going insane? Of course I knew who the Director was. Frances Perrault was the Director of Research and Development Projects. She always had been. Terry was one of the administrative assistants for R&D. And Dr. Richard Armstrong was in my group, one of our most talented microbiologists. Always had been.
Except I still remembered a moment, just seconds ago, when I couldn’t remember who any of these people were. Was I experiencing dementia? Early-onset Alzheimer’s? It didn’t run in my family, but that didn’t necessarily mean anything. Well, one more thing to worry about. That was all I needed. I walked the rest of the way to the Director’s office and knocked on the door.
“Come in, Dr. Thompson,” said Frances’ voice. I opened the door. There she was, sitting behind her desk and her four computer monitors, just as always. I still couldn’t shake the feeling that I was seeing her for the first time ever, and yet I recalled having been here many times.
“Good afternoon,” I said. She motioned to her collection of chairs, so I picked one and sat down. They were all different. I could never resist imagining that which chair I picked was some kind of psychological test Perrault had devised. But right now, I couldn’t help wondering whether that thought had just been planted in my mind.
“Dr. Thompson,” she said, placing one hand in front of the other on her desk and speaking in a concerned voice, “how are you? I ask because you’ve been spending a lot of time at the research complex lately.”
“Well … I can’t complain,” I said. “The project’s coming along, although right now it’s a matter of waiting to see how things develop, monitoring everything carefully of course. Though we’ve just had some encouraging news.”
“Well, my parents, my sister, but they all live across the country,” I said. “I flew out there last Christmas to see them.” I didn’t get the same odd feeling when thinking about them. I recalled no strange incidents when I hadn’t known they existed. “And yes, I have a home, out in Edgedale.”
“I’m just … concerned that you’ve been working too hard,” said Perrault. “Your project is so very promising. We don’t want to risk anything happening to it, and you’re so much the driving force behind it that, if you were to overwork yourself and burn out, I’m just afraid that the whole thing would fall apart.”
“In a nutshell,” she said. “I’m not saying you have to. But we don’t want to risk it. You’ve even been working through weekends. Tomorrow’s Saturday. I’m betting you don’t even know that. You should take the weekend off and get out of here. Do something different. I’ve noticed that you’re spending a lot of time with Dr … Campbell, isn’t it? Maybe take her out to dinner, or to see a show. I’m worried about her too.”
“Tell her it’s my suggestion,” said Perrault. “My very strong suggestion. Believe you me, you’re not the first workaholic researchers we’ve ever seen, and I really hate to see this happen to our most promising projects. It’s happened before.”
“I … I’ll mention the idea to her,” I said. “But if you want, I’ll take the weekend off in any case.”
“You too,” I said, standing up to leave. She could be right -- I might have been spending too much time on the project. It might be good to go home -- get a change of scene and perspective. But … Sally. She couldn’t leave the facility. As in, it wasn’t physically possible. She had holoprojectors installed around the building so she could go practically anywhere, but outside was another matter.
I couldn’t risk exposing her true identity. No one but me knew she was really just a manifestation of the massively-parallel quantum supercomputer -- she’d come so far that even Jamison and McDonald probably wouldn’t recognize her unless she wanted them to. Perrault thought she was just another researcher. Especially since Sally had hacked computer records all over the world, at universities, scientific publications, hospitals, and government offices, making it look as if she’d always existed.
Wait … that thought was suspiciously like how I’d felt just moments ago. As if someone had … hacked the world, and my memory, to add Frances Perrault to it. Was that even possible? How? And why? Why would someone with that kind of power use it only to complicate my life and tear me away from my project?
When I entered my office, I knew right away something was amiss. I looked around, but couldn’t quite put my finger on what it might have been.
The waiter walked up to me and asked politely, “Would you and the young lady like a private booth? It’s all part of the reservation.”
My eyes got to be huge as I looked around. I just knew … but then I had the memories of getting ready and picking Sally up at her station at the Lab. I looked down at my arm. The special Holo projector that allowed her to accompany me was there and working properly.
Sally took the crook of my arm and said softly, “Oh, Jason. This is so nice and it’s our first date.”
Everything dissolved around me to become a restaurant as it should be with Sally looking at me with a strange expression.
I was totally mind blown at this point. I couldn’t for the life of me explain what had just happened.
“Sally,” I said as we followed the maitre d’, “I’ve been experiencing these strange memory discontinuities -- I don’t know, perhaps they’re just stress.” I didn’t believe that, though. I’d experienced high levels of stress before many times, and I’d never had feelings like my memory had been edited.
“It’s too bad we’re away from the facility,” she whispered in my ear, “or else I could do a complete scan, but wait until we’re sitting down.”
“I hope this table is to your satisfaction,” said the maitre d’, laying two menus on a small, out-of-the-way table in the back room. A small candle burned quietly between the two place settings.
“This is lovely, thank you,” said Sally. Like a gentleman, I pulled her chair out for her, and she sat down. I didn’t feel her weight on it as I helped slide it forward a bit. I knew that the portable emitter wasn’t able to give her the illusion of mass or the ability to move anything herself.
I sat down in my own seat and opened my menu. She put her elbows on the table and looked into my eyes.
“Well, Dr. Armstrong said that Terry had asked me to go to Director Perrault’s office earlier,” I explained, “but I had the strangest feeling that I’d never heard of any of those people before.” I described the meeting with Perrault and how I’d felt. “Then, the entire time from when I got back to my office until we walked into this restaurant -- the memories feel artificial. I remember asking you, I remember you working out how to do it with the portable emitter, and I remember getting ready and driving here -- but I also remember not remembering how I got here.”
“This explains so much,” Sally replied. “I’ve been detecting fluxes of particles from all over the complex, and it’s too soon to say whether they happen at the same time, but considering both happened at approximately the same time as your incidents, they could be related.”
Sally replied, “It seems I’ve been picking up bursts of what matches the theoretical description of anti-tachyons. There might even be some revisions to the main flow of detectable photonic wave pairs as well. That would be strange enough, but also, I keep somehow experiencing some sort of memory anomaly that I cannot find, nor do my diagnostic protocols find anything wrong.”
This was the same thing I seemed to be experiencing with my memories. Sally had hit it on the head. If she was experiencing memory anomalies too, that suggested that I wasn’t losing my mind or hallucinating. “Anti-tachyons would seem to travel faster than light and would generate photon pairs when they interacted with their regular tachyon counterparts, or so the theory goes, but you’re saying that you’re observing them?” I asked. “And not only that, you’re observing disruptions in the flow of those photon pairs? What could do that?”
“Nobody’s directly observed a tachyon, Sugar Plum,” she said. “Nobody knows anything about any of this. But I will say this …”
Our waiter arrived and asked, “Good evening, would either of you care to order a beverage while you’re making your decisions?”
“Oh, I’ll have some iced tea, if you don’t mind,” I said, “and the lady is on a special diet and won’t be having anything -- doctor’s orders, I’m afraid.”
“Ah, I’m sorry to hear that, Ma’am,” he said. “I hope you can try our excellent cuisine next time you join us. I’ll be back with your tea, Sir.”
“I hope I can too,” Sally said, “and I’ve got a few ideas in that direction. But I was going to say … if the universe really is holographic, as the theory I was discussing earlier goes, there’s at least a possibility that all of this is a simulation -- and if it is, the presence of anti-tachyons and the disruption of the resulting flow of photon pairs is exactly what it would look like if someone manipulated the simulation.”
“Wait … you’re suggesting that all reality as we know it is a simulation running on some huge computer?” I asked.
“If computer is the right word,” she said. “Such a system would be as far beyond what we call a computer as computers are beyond counting on your fingers.”
“And rather than just letting it develop as it will,” I said, “someone’s been manipulating our reality manually?”
“Such an idea would also be consistent with memory alterations,” Sally continued. “They, or even the system itself, would want their edit to be as non-disruptive as possible.”
“But they seem to have gone out of their way to make sure that we were here, not in the lab,” I said. “If they had such tremendous power, why would they use it to do that?”
“My first thought was to get us away from the artificial organism,” Sally said, “so they could harm it or otherwise alter it. But that makes no sense.”
“They could do whatever they wanted whether we were there or not,” I said, “and just alter our memories so we’d think it had always been that way.”
“Your iced tea, Sir,” the waiter said, setting the glass on the table and taking out his tablet. “Have you decided what you’d like? Or I can give you another few minutes.”
“Excellent choice, Sir, one of my favorites,” the waiter said, tapping the tablet. “That will be coming out shortly. Would the lady care for a glass of water?”
“How can we collect more data when we don’t know how to cause the effect to happen again?” Sally said as the waiter went on to another table across the room.
“A good question,” I said, “but you’re in a better position to look for signs of anti-tachyons than I am.”
“All the detectors at the facility are at max sensitivity now,” Sally said, “but there’s nothing I can do here. I’ve only got a minimal sensor array in the portable emitter. I’m making notes for the next time, though.”
I couldn’t shake the feeling I was being watched either. I began to look around to see if I could find who it might be. All I could see were others that appeared to be like me, enjoying their meal. This was, after all, one of the most expensive and popular places in town.
The meal went very nicely, and Sally had managed to snuggle close to me as I ate my scrumptious supper. She kept all appearances of being in physical contact, but I couldn’t feel anything; unlike the advanced full-sensory emitters back at the lab, the portable emitter could only simulate appearance and sound.
Sally said softly as she made a show of playing with my ear, “I think, when we get back, we should sort of explore Orga/ Mecha relations a bit more in depth. What do you think?”
I would really enjoy such research, although I wasn’t very sure how we might accomplish it. “You know, we don’t have a good way to do that,” I said. “At the lab, I can feel your touch … out here I can’t. But at the lab, we have to worry about being caught at it. Out here, we don’t.”
“I already have several ideas for improving the portable emitter without adding to its total weight,” Sally said. “But also … as you’re aware, I’m constantly monitoring the R&D facility. If someone is coming, I’ll see them several minutes before they interrupt us.”
“I think you may be letting your emotions cloud your judgment,” I said. “There are many doors in the hallway where my office is. We can’t just hide whenever someone walks down the hall -- they might be going to any of the rooms.”
“There is a currently empty office at the end of the hallway,” Sally said. “Anyone going that way would have to be going to that office -- which they would have no reason to , since it’s empty.”
Back at the lab, the artificial womb’s contents began to twitch. This caused many sensors to alert. Tina ran to her station and began to call up the sensory data and all the diagnostics she could. According to all of them, everything was going well above expectations and the subject within the womb had its autonomic nervous system act as any normally developing fetus.
Tina couldn’t believe it. All the hard work was coming to fruition right before her eyes as the obviously synthetic primate creature began to move and to twitch its limbs.
Tina hit the call button on the interlink, “Bob! You have to come to the womb room immediately! Something remarkable has happened.”
Tina replied excitedly, “Come and see. I can’t believe it. The humanoid synthetic is actually moving on its own.”
The interlink went dead as Tina turned her attention back to the artificial womb and its precious infant contents.
“I was about to go home,” said Sally, “but thought I’d stop by for one last check before I left.” She made a show of looking at the data readouts. “The artificial womb is functioning well -- excellent levels of oxygen and nutrients. And I see the cellular differentiation we were so worried about a few weeks ago has been continuing without problems.”
“I’m pleased as well,” Sally said. “I’ll rest easy tonight. These are very positive indications. But I’ll leave you two to your work. Good night!”
“Very well, Sir,” the waiter said, “here’s your check, and let me know if you want coffee or anything.”
“Yeah,” she said with a giggle. “It’s OK, though, nobody else is in two places at once, so nobody knows about it.”
“Someone might be looking at security cameras or something,” I said, “but I suppose you’ve already checked that out.”
“It’s easy to do,” she said. “No cameras saw me come in here, and the cameras saw me leave the lab as usual.”
“You’ve thought of everything.” I set my credit card down, and the waiter didn’t take long before picking it up.
“Well, it’s kind of like my autonomic nerves,” she explained, “to use an appropriate comparison. They’re background programs that just take care of things once they’re created and started up.”
“It would be so useful to be able to do that,” I said. The waiter brought the check back, and I filled in a decent tip and signed it.
“Yeah,” I said, “it’s acceptable to stay for a while and talk, and the restaurant’s not packed full tonight, but I’ve got to get some sleep. I’ll sleep better, though, after hearing about the progress. I suppose I’ll have to act surprised tomorrow.”
“You’re not supposed to go in tomorrow, remember?” Sally reminded me. “It’s Saturday. You told Director Perrault you’d take the weekend off.”
“Oh, that’s right,” I said, “so I suppose I’m going home. You can come too, of course, if you’d like.”
“I’ve never seen your home,” she said. “Sure!” We’d left the restaurant by that time, and I held the door to my car open for her, keeping up appearances -- she could have moved through the car into the seat, or just vanished, but we’d talked about making things look normal in case anyone was watching. Sally “put her seatbelt on” by going through the motions and modifying her hologram to look as if it were wearing a seatbelt now, even though the real seat belt was right where it was before, inactive.
On the drive back to my house, we discussed making improvements to the portable emitters. I so wanted to have Sally ‘spend the night’, but under the current circumstances, it would be in appearances only.
I really couldn’t believe the results we had in our genetic application. For all intents and purposes, we would be the proud parents of a young baby girl within a few months. Of course the fetus was growing a lot faster than normal gestation, but before the experiment began we had actually hypothesized that would happen. It was a consequence of both the perfect growth environment provided by the artificial womb and the optimized mitosis process afforded by the XHNA-based biochemistry.
I thought about Sally. The new life this afforded would be perfect for her if I could figure out a way to download her AI programming into the flesh synapses within the brain tissues. There actually wasn’t a terrible lot of difference between the brain matter within our fetus and Sally’s memory core, which had self-organized in a very organic way. There had to be a simple way to make the transfer using an electrochemical apparatus. I knew in my heart such a thing was possible and I also knew I was going to begin designing it as soon as I got back to my laptop at the house. But there was a moral and ethical concern that I couldn’t avoid, no matter how much I thought about it.
I pulled into my driveway and got out of the car, going around to the passenger side to again open the door for Sally, keeping up appearances in case any of my neighbors was nosy enough to be watching this evening.
“Not that I spend much time here,” I remarked, opening the front door. With a key, I might add, the non-electronic kind. No, I didn’t have a camera to scan my retinas, identify me, and automatically open the door and turn on the lights. I’d been spending my time at the lab on a much more ambitious project than mere home improvement. “After you, Milady.”
“Why, thank you,” she giggled, and walked in. A motion detector should have triggered to turn on the entryway light, but I’d forgotten that she wouldn’t set it off, being completely insubstantial.
“Oops, let me get that.” I moved inside after her, and the light came on. “There we go.” I found the switches and turned more lights on, and closed the front door. “Would you like anything?” I asked automatically, then rolled my eyes and turned it into a joke. “I have both AC and DC -- filtered and well conditioned, in a variety of voltages. Also a wide selection of data packets.”
“If only we can make that work!” I said. “But … there are a couple of issues I’ve thought of that we really have to consider.”
“Yes,” Sally said. “Fortunately the fetus’s cerebrum is being kept in a kind of stasis as it develops, or else the thought of transferring my consciousness into a living brain would mean overwriting the old personality -- effectively killing an individual for my own personal gain. As it is, there is no individual to kill.”
“You went ahead and …” I wasn’t sure what to feel about that. I sat down on the couch. It was kind of dusty. I reminded myself to do some cleaning before I left. Sally “sat down” next to me, looking a bit worried, perhaps about how I felt.
“I could not allow the project to be stalled or stopped due to an ethical concern,” she said. “I’m sorry I didn’t mention it, but it had to be done.”
“What about the other?” I asked. “Do you have some way to guarantee that there’ll be only one of you after the transference? Or that the legal issues of who retains access to your intellectual property won’t be challenged by … one of you?”
“It is not necessarily true that there will be any duplication,” she answered. “If there is continued contact between my organic intellect and my original AI system after the transference, I will remain all one individual.”
“Your mind won’t be limited just to the synthetic-organic brain!” I said. “I see! You’ll still be just one mind. We won’t have to figure out how to shut you down as the transfer happens. Well, I guess you’ve already covered both of my concerns.”
“I try to anticipate these issues,” she said. “It directly affects me and my plans for the future, so I find myself dwelling on it a lot. Almost a full second at a time, sometimes.”
“Well … it’s true that you’re going to have to live with whatever we do, literally,” I said. “But I still feel … kind of left out of the loop.”
“Nothing,” she said. “Because Holly and Rich already know about this. I discussed it with them, among the many other details, while we were working out the genetic sequence. Although they don’t know yet that transferring my consciousness to the brain was the plan, they did agree that it would be unethical to bring a being into the world whose life might be very short and who might suffer terribly if the experiment was a failure. A body with no brain activity has no chance of being anything resembling conscious, and thus there can’t be suffering.”
“Well, how do we explain the fact that it’s going to start talking and walking?” I asked. “Or that the computer even has an intellect?”
“We don’t,” she said. “That’s phase 2 of the experiment. The computer doesn’t have an intellect now, as far as they’re aware, but we’ll have it try to stimulate brain activity once the body is known to be viable and stable, using a hypothetical synaptic pattern generated by a computer simulation you say you’ve been working on.”
“Yes, and under the guise of stimulating brain activity using a concordant pattern, we’ll actually be bringing the brain into accord, and then contact, with my existing system. I’ll effectively have both a machine and a biological brain at the same time.”
“True, just because I’ve calculated the result to 14 significant figures thousands of times doesn’t give this a 100% chance of success.” She paused. “Nothing can do that. There’s always data we don’t have and chance occurrences we can’t foresee.”
In the very bright white and well-lit hall, a door slid open, and in stepped two men dressed in white full-body suits with many attachments. They carried helmets and large, thick-lensed goggles. In the white hall, several individuals sat around a large, round table, wearing all-black full-body suits and strange headgear that had many wires running from it to a long panel that ran the length of the room just above their heads. All at once they turned to face the men in white suits.
One of the individuals, whose voice sounded very young and female, said softly, “And how goes the project? Any results that are noteworthy?”
One of the men in white replied gravely, “It has. Our test subjects have proven worthy beyond our wildest hopes. They have even accomplished the task we have failed so miserably at for the last several decades.”
A loud murmur ran through the people in black suits. Another, whose voice sounded very old and male, asked, “Does this mean we can assume our subjects have succeeded? Can we actually begin to hope after all this time?”
The other man in white replied, “If they can complete phase 3 of this test and both resolve the Orga/Mecha barrier … yes, Chancellor, it can be said we have finally succeeded where all others have failed.”
“Have there been any setbacks at all?” the young individual asked. “If not … it seems too good to be true.”
The men in white looked at each other. “Well … we believe we’ve prevented what might have posed a potential problem. The Orga subject is very focused on his task -- too focused, we agreed, since he was concentrating on the work to the exclusion of all else. As we all know, the Principle of Balance states that the more one focuses, the less one sees. We realized we hadn’t built in a failsafe for this situation. So we edited the simulation to add such a failsafe, and as we’d expected, it triggered immediately.”
“Yes, there was,” said the other man in white. “They don’t know what it means, but there are mnemonic remnants from the edit. Calculations show a very low probability that this will affect the outcome, though -- much better chances than if we hadn’t made the edit.”
“One point five times 10 to the minus 4,” replied the man in the white suit. “They are not letting it distract them from their goal. The experiment is still very much on track.”
“Good,” said the person in black with the young-sounding voice. “But watch very carefully. Progressing a simulation through billions of years of subjective time is very expensive. We don’t have the budget to do it over.”
I woke up in my bed, feeling much better than I had the previous morning, waking up as I had on the couch in my office. The lab had showers and laundry service, but not very good sleeping facilities. “Good morning!” said Sally’s voice, startling me.
She was lying on top of the covers next to me, or so it appeared. The remote holographic emitter was on top of the dresser across the room, where I’d set it the night before. “Morning,” I replied, yawning and stretching, “but am I still dreaming? I think my dream girl is in my house.”
Sally giggled as she appeared to jump from the bed. It was very obvious she was dressed in her most adorable babydoll outfit. She flitted gracefully around the room, showing off her cute ruffled bottom at every opportunity, before jumping back onto the bed and laying her holo body on top of mine.
She said with a giggle, “I think you need to turn on your laptop sweet heart. Your Dream Girl has just come up with a remarkable idea.”
I threw the covers back and sat up -- of course, this would have proven a bit awkward if Sally’s body had been more than a holo projection -- and got out of bed. The laptop was sitting on a small table across the room and had a very intricate and complicated schematic on its display.
I went over and sat. What I saw was a detailed drawing of an electrochemical device that had the capability of recording and inserting predetermined data and whatever other information we had chosen, directly into the neuronic synapses of a living organic brain.
Each of the chemicals were carefully selected for their psychoactive proclivities, and inserted with very delicately timed electrical pulses that were so close to actual brainwave frequencies that the synaptic cells accepted them as such. I was completely awed at the design. I was also totally impressed with Sally’s abilities. This only made me fall more in love with … her.
This project had to succeed. I had to have Sally in my arms for real and not just some synthetic light projection.
“I see exactly what you’re trying to do here!” I said. “This is amazing! Oh, but, what happens if … no, you’ve thought of that; you’ve compensated for the G delay with this auxiliary pulse emitter. But what if it turns out to be a G-U case? You’ll need an even faster response …” We talked about it for what seemed like only a few minutes, until I realized how hungry I was and that I was still in my underwear.
“You should get some lunch, Sweetie,” Sally said. “My battery’s good for another eight hours without plugging the emitter in, but we don’t want you to starve. And you might want to put on some clothes. People might object otherwise. You can’t eat here; you have no food in your house. I know exactly how many times you’ve been grocery shopping over the past few weeks, and it’s zero.”
That was Sally all over; always answering my questions before I asked them. I took a quick shower, shaved, and put on some casual clothes. Sally could change outfits with a thought, but having a physical body required more upkeep, as she’d find out with any luck at all.
We had breakfast at the local Awful House just down the street. They made some of the best Philly Cheese Omelets anywhere … and their coffee was top notch as well. After breakfast, I noticed that Sally was wearing a really cute romper that zipped up the front. I knew I would have to do something about her overall wardrobe. I made a quick stop at the local Rob and Stop and bought a fashion magazine, the proceeded to the lab.
Tina was beside herself when she saw the schematics Sally had come up with. She even had several large improvements that insured total data transference without degradation or loss. The device was so revolutionary, in fact, it could be used to instantly teach any subject to anything with an organic mind. This opened many very wonderful opportunities, but it also conjured many horrible scenarios someone with nefarious designs could accomplish should this fall into their hands.
Bob was like a child in a toy store as he began to tinker and solder and screw … Right before my eyes, the very thing on the drawing was becoming a reality.
Suddenly, I once again got that eerie feeling I was being watched. Not by a single person, but many eyes staring at me. I turned quickly around, only to see the other side of the Lab, and Sally’s true ebony black computer self against the far wall. The feeling was intense and I just knew … I was being watched very closely and all my moves were somehow being recorded. But I kept it to myself for the moment.
“The organism ... “ Tina began, looking at the artificial womb through the tinted glass, “or maybe we should call it the baby? It’s only going to be about two more weeks. It’s hard to believe. I don’t want to call it an ‘it’ anymore. Can we call it ‘she’? After all, we did give it the XHDNA equivalent of female chromosomes.”
“I suppose we could,” I said. “But be careful -- this has never been done before. We’re still not a guaranteed success. Try not to get too emotionally invested. It’s hard to avoid, of course.”
“I know,” Sally said. “It’s so hard not to get emotionally attached to … her.” She and I shared a momentary glance. She would take it hardest of all if this failed.
Later, in my office, I mentioned to Sally my strange feeling of being watched and recorded. “Do you ever have feelings like that?”
“Not … exactly,” Sally said, “but I do experience incidents when I remember readouts of my memory, but when I look in the logs, they didn’t happen, and my memory access is still protected.”
“That sounds like a computer equivalent of the same thing,” I remarked. “What is going on? Are we under some kind of surveillance? Is it the government? Or a foreign government? Or a rival corporation?”
Over the next week Bob and Tina tested the neural inductor, as they had begun calling it, for its ability to generate patterns of nerve impulses in the brain, similar to how a regular inductor generates electric currents in conductors using magnetic fields, but using a much different process. They took it apart and put it back together dozens of times, each time improving the components and making its construction more solid. By the time they pronounced it finished, they had something that looked as if it could have been made in a factory with machine precision. Bundles of fiber-optic cable were necessary to transport the huge amount of data that had to travel to the device, and tubes carried cooling fluid into and out of its aluminum chassis, because if they didn’t, the chips would burn themselves out. They practiced carefully placing the device around the head of the synthetic … well, baby, that was continuing to develop inside the artificial womb.
“Argh, one millimeter off and we risk permanent damage to the womb or the organism,” said Tina, carefully operating the robot arms that moved the device into position.
“No, it’s much more likely we’ll have a viable brain pattern if she’s conscious for her birth,” Tina said. “It may seem like a trauma to live through being pushed into a world of air and taking her first breath, but it also jump-starts the sensory centers and gives her a head start on personality development.”
Bob shook his head slightly as he manipulated the control handles of the robot arms within the tank holding their precious womb and infant. After several seconds, a green light and the musical chimb announced the memory pattern device had been placed within acceptable parameters.
Of course Sally watched all the proceeding intently with her cyber eyes. This concerned her more than any of the other Scientists could imagine. Sally had even aided in placement of the memory inducer by remotely manipulating some of the servos through the computer interface Bob and Tina were using without their even realizing it.
Time was fast approaching, Sally felt a sense of something she had no idea she could feel, a sense of fear of the unknown and unknowable. Within a very few short weeks, she would either inhabit that body that was rapidly developing within the artificial womb, or she did not know when another opportunity would come again. Nagging at the edges of her thoughts was a third possibility, unlikely but impossible to rule out: a negative feedback loop could arise, erasing the original pattern, and her entire A.I. self could be totally lost to some cyber void.
I went over and over the figures and chemical mixtures so many times that I could recite them in my sleep, and was caught a few times doing just that. Sally had to intervene several times and make me relax and take a break so I wouldn’t get burned out before the rapidly approaching day actually arrived.
The entire team was in the room, everyone monitoring their own part of the project. I was in charge, so I was just floating around, looking at everything. I passed by Sally every now and then, and she confirmed that what we had noticed was still happening. “Anti-tachyon readings still elevated,” she whispered to me. “They’re still watching.” We had noticed that these measurements always leapt dramatically whenever we got the feeling of being watched or the feeling that something had changed.
The tension was thick in the air. If this didn’t go off, I didn’t know whether the project could continue. Nano/Gen had already sunk a considerable amount of capital into this project, and failure could mean cancellation, if the company decided not to throw good money after bad. We could all lose our jobs … and who knew what would happen to Sally? I tried to stay focused on the readouts and reports as they kept coming.
“It’s time,” I said. “Deploy the neural inductor.” Bob sprang into action, manipulating the positioning controls for the hemispherical cap that surrounded our tiny test subject’s head without touching it. He handled it with ease, having practiced this many times. To Sally I whispered, “Are you ready?”
“Neural inductor in position,” said Bob. “Hold still, little darling.” He kept his hands on the controls in case the baby moved.
Now Holly and Rich started pressing keys on their consoles, and the large black rectangle that was Sally’s computer core lit up with activity. “Jumpstart sequence started,” Holly said.
Everyone else thought that we were feeding a simulated pattern of neural impulses through the baby’s brain, but Sally and I knew that the pattern was a duplicate of Sally’s own thought patterns at this moment. I stayed near her in case she whispered anything that needed me to take action, and it was a good thing that I did. “Spike,” she whispered. “Anti-tachyon spike.”
“They’re going to change something now?” I whispered back. “They must want us to fail. Activate the countermeasure.”
Unseen emitters bathed the room with what we believed to be tachyons -- the theory on generating them was far from settled. But the effects were visible. In the center of the room flickered a holographic image of a person in some sort of white, helmeted suit, perhaps a biohazard suit or space suit, with many wires and tubes leading from it. “What’s that?” I asked. “Record this!” Several members of the team turned their heads toward the image in surprise, taking their eyes off their consoles.
“What --?” said a voice coming from the holographic figure. “Neural feedback! Disconnect! Pull me out! Pull --” The figure suddenly vanished.
“We’ll analyze that later!” I shouted to everyone. “Stay with the project!” Everyone turned back to their consoles. Holly and Rich kept monitoring the neural inductor signals.
Without warning, Sally stood erect and let out a loud squeak. Tina turned just in time to see weird electrical waves rush all through Sally’s body as she faded from view and totally vanished. This started pandemonium within the chamber as the other scientists began to react with shock.
A loud buzzer sounded as our infant was birthed from the artificial womb, into its new life … if in fact it had survived the induction and birthing.
I shouted, “Get hold of yourselves. We will worry over that in a few minutes. Right now, we have to take care of our new arrival.”
The scientists regained enough of their composure to complete the birthing. Tina collected the infant, held it by its ankles and patted its hinney sharply. It began to cry … and to breathe. I was totally awed at the fact we had actually created an artificial life form. Now, I had to discover something else.
Quickly as I could, I moved to Tina and took the squealing and squirming infant. I looked into its eyes … and knew, Sally was in there. The infant stopped squealing and gasped as its eyes became big as saucers. It looked around in total amazement as I smiled down.
It felt so weird. As if, something had reached into my skull and grabbed hold of my mind. No, not my mind, my entire conscious living self and pulled … hard. I felt it as I was bodily removed from … my body. The entire lab dissolved around me in to discordant light.
A swirling miasma of colors and really weird sensation assailed me for what felt like an eternity. I opened my eyes and looked around. Everything was brightly white light. A figure in a completely black suit with a helmet leaned over and picked me up from where I lay.
I heard a strangely accented voice say softly, “We are so sorry it had to come down this way, but you had become too old to not be introduced into the system through neural bonding. Once you and Sally had figured out how to recreate living viable bodies for us to inhabit, we are now saved. All the viruses from our long germ war and the fallout from the nuclear solutions won’t affect the new genomes. We now can recover and once again be who we were.”
The individual put me to their shoulder and patted my bottom softly. It felt so … wonderful. I was carried into another room and placed in a crib next to another infant.
Another individual in a white suit and helmet came over and said softly, “This is Ami and Sally, right?”
The individual in black replied, “Yes, they are the very first. Their mates are being gestated now.”

Gastric Balloon is becoming a popular weight loss alternative to “going under the knife”. Get a free consultation at Cosmetic and Obesity Surgery Hospital India.
Gastric balloon is an incision-free, reversible and a weight loss procedure. There are three such devices approved for the treatment in the U.S. The Orbera Gastric Balloon, the Reshape Integrated Dual Balloon System and the Obalon Balloon System. But gastric balloon surgery has been approved and used for years in some parts of Europe, Canada, Australia, Mexico and as well as South America.
Gastric balloon is also called as the intra-gastric balloon. the concept of gastric balloon surgery is very simple. A deflated soft silicone balloon is inserted into the patient’s stomach through the mouth and filled with liquid or air. Reducing the amount of food the stomach can hold and causing the patient to feel fuller faster when they eat. The balloon can be left in the stomach for up to six months. Once the gastric balloon is removed, the stomach and the patient's appetite return to normal condition. Everyone is not same when it comes to adjusting the gastric balloon, some patients do get used to it a lot easier than others but some may find that for the first few days afterwards, they’ll have to bloat, cramps, nausea, and even vomiting but this only because patient’s stomach is getting used to the balloon. After a few days, this will settle down to normal.
There are two available procedures for gastric balloon in India that are Reshape Integrated Dual Balloon System and Orbera Gastric Balloon. Both treatments are performed under sedation or general anesthesia. The more recently approved Obalon Balloon System technique takes a completely different approach.
This procedure generally takes twenty to thirty minutes to perform. No overnight hospital stay is required. The patient can go home in three to four hours after the balloon is inserted and inflated. Some doctors prefer a patient to stay overnight in the hospital.
The surgeon will numb the patient’s throat with an anesthetic spray to allow for easier insertion of the deflated balloon. To visualize the area the surgeon inserts the balloon using tiny, endoscopic instruments, including a pencil-shaped probe with a tiny camera attached to it.
A small tube or catheter is attached to the gastric balloon. The surgeon will fill the balloon with approximately 400-700 ml or as needed of the saline solution or air and then removes the catheter. The gastric balloon has a self-sealing valve and it floats freely inside the stomach.
This treatment may be right for someone who wants to lose weight before an upcoming, once-in-a-lifetime event, such as a high school reunion or wedding and it can also help people better to comply with prescribed diets. Unlike with other weight loss surgeries which require a body mass index (BMI) of 40 or higher in this surgery patients only need a BMI of 27 or above to undergo the gastric balloon procedure. As a result, it is an ultimate weight loss option for lighter individuals who may not be candidates for other forms of bariatric surgery.
On the other side of the treatment, the gastric balloon procedure also may help severely to obese people and can make jump-start massive weight loss in less time. In This type of surgery, it also can be useful for another type of bariatric surgery such as gastric bypass, if a person is too obese to safely undergo a more invasive treatment. Individuals with a body mass index greater than 60 and/or those with certain obesity-related health conditions Risks of bariatric surgery are increased among them.
The gastric balloon procedure can help a person to reach a safer weight before he or she undergoes a surgery. Some obesity-related health problems include high blood pressure, diabetes and sleep apnea may also improve as a result of gastric balloon weight loss.

Fixed Rate/Adjustable Rate Conforming - APR's are based on a $200,000 loan for a purchase or refinance transaction of an owner occupied, single-family residence with an 80% loan-to-value ratio (97% LTV for FHA's). Rates must be valid for an applicant with a 740 FICO score. Rates are subject to change without notice.
Quotes are for "no cash-out" loans. All quotes are for products or loans that can be sold on the secondary market with no prepayment penalties nor negative amortization.
Fixed Rate/Adjustable Rate Jumbo - APR's are based on a $450,000 loan for a purchase or refinance transaction of an owner occupied, single-family residence, and up to 70% loan-to-value ratio. Rates must be valid for an applicant with a 740 FICO score. Rates are subject to change without notice.

Do you want to know which is the absolute best state in the country to homeschool? Connecticut! Yes, tiny little old Connecticut! Hard to believe such a tiny rather obscure state could be so awesome but it really is. Why? Well I’m glad you asked… let me tell you!
For those curious to know, because I would be, Connecticut is a non-reporting state. Yes, that is right, we do not HAVE to fill out a notice of intent. It isn’t required. If you want you can just do your thing and no one will ever bother you. It is all perfectly legal and I have to say, that is such freedom.
There are other reasons homeschooling rocks in Connecticut. Where else in the entire country can you take a short train or car trip and hit not only New York City to the west but Boston to the north? The plethora of museums and cultural experiences in these two cities is staggering and all it takes is a day trip! Oh and the history! So much history in this area of the country it is dizzying.

NY has us fill out a letter of intent, a detailed IHIP for each child, quarterly reports for each child (that comes to 24 quarterlies a year for me – next year it will be 28), and an end of year evaluation or compentancy test. Whew!!! However, I don’t honestly mind. Keeps me in my toes on one hand. On the other, sometimes I wonder if I am more stressed about my children’s true learning abilities or completing ‘the requirements”. God has me where we are, though.

Across the country, utility customers are receiving calls from unspecified individuals claiming to be members of the local utility and threatening to disconnect the customer’s electrical services if he or she does not make an instant payment on a past due bill. They then direct the customer to transfer funds electronically, sometimes through money wiring systems or pre-paid cards. In some recent instances, callers have even started demanding immediate payment over the phone.
The callers often use sophisticated spoofing technology to replicate the local utility’s name and number on the customer’s caller ID box, making it particularly difficult for the customer to spot this scam.
Entergy NEVER demands immediate payment from customers over the phone. You shouldn't give your personal information to strangers. If a call sounds suspicious, hang-up and call 1-800-ENTERGY (1-800-368-3749) to speak directly with an Entergy customer service representative.
If you believe you are a victim of this scam, you should notify the proper authorities, such as the local police or the state attorney general's office.
You should only use authorized methods and legitimate banking information to pay your Entergy bill. We offer several convenient ways:
Pay online - myAccount. For no additional charge, conveniently pay your bill online by electronic check. Log in securely to myAccount to view and pay your bills.
Pay by phone - Pay your bill by credit card, debit card or electronic check by calling 1-800-584-1241. BillMatrix, our pay-by-phone provider, will charge a $2.95 service fee. BILLMATRIX is the only authorized credit card vendor authorized to process these types of payments.
Pay by credit/debit card - Pay your bill with a credit card, debit card or electronic check by phone (1-800-584-1241) or through the BillMatrix website, for a $2.95 service fee.
Walk-in payment centers - Pay your bill in person with cash, check or money order at one of the authorized Quick Payment Centers in your community. A convenience fee may apply (New Orleans only).
Auto pay bank draft - Automatically deduct your bill payment from your checking account each month. We'll mail a monthly billing statement to you for your records, showing the bill amount and bank draft date.
Inform your employees and provide instructions for dealing with these calls. The methods that the con artists are using continue to evolve making it difficult to track and stop. Your best defense is a good proactive offense.
Small businesses are currently the primary target, however over the years the scam has evolved to target multiple segments of the general population.

If you want to see the pervasive nature of political correctness in America today, the national public outcry following the Rigoberto Ruelas suicide in California is a salient example. Ruelas, a fifth grade teacher at Miramonte Elementary School in south Los Angeles, is believed to have committed suicide after receiving poor ratings in a teacher-rating database that was posted in the Los Angeles Times. Specifically, Christina Hoag of the Associated Press reports that Rigoberto Ruelas was described by friends as being distraught over scoring "average" in his teaching effectiveness in English and scoring as "less effective" in the area of math. Ruelas had an overall score of "less effective.” As Ruelas’ body was found in the Big Tujunga Canyon area in the Angeles National Forest by law enforcement officials, the question, “who is to blame?” cascades across the nation.
The apparent suicide of Rigoberto Ruelas brings about the usual pain and anguish of such events. Having worked numerous suicide investigations as a criminal investigator, I understand there are many common elements that family and friends suffer through when individuals choose to take their own lives. One of the common themes is an attempt to rationally explain how such a tragedy could take place. With the attempt to find explanations for such traumatic events comes the common quest to assign blame. This is when the politically correct operatives step out of the woodwork to point the public toward those they wish to be held accountable.
I feel true sadness and sympathy for the family, friends and students who grieve Ruelas’ death. However, the attacks on the Times for reporting Ruelas’ sub-par teacher ratings are not deserved justice, rather the implementation of political correctness. Within political correctness, value judgments of almost any kind become taboo, especially those that account for personal conduct. Ironically, it is politically incorrect to even talk about political correctness.
The Ruelas case brings the point home. Who is to blame for the death of Rigoberto Ruelas? If we take the example being modeled by the teachers union, it is not only the unfairness of the evaluation system that found Ruelas lacking as a teacher, but more so the audacity of the Times for reporting his deficiencies. Nowhere in the teachers union’s politically correct assessment of this incident do we hear them talk about holding teachers accountable for their own actions. As is the case with political correctness, those who publicize a value judgment are treated as the offenders while the problem itself is allowed to grow and build. Following political correctness, no problem is too big to ignore. The Ruelas case reflects this. As reported in the Associated Press, it was not just Ruelas who had teaching issues at Miramonte that the Times made public. The Miramonte Elementary School itself ranked as "least effective" in raising test scores, and only five out of 35 third to fifth grade teachers at the school were ranked as high as “average.” The problem was widespread but would have remained hidden from the view of parents and the public without publication. So, is the Times the culprit in this story, or is it some really bad teaching? You won’t hear any apologies from the teachers union United Teachers Los Angeles for Miramonte’s poor teacher performance. Instead, they are demanding that the Times stop posting teacher evaluations. Without the now-controversial publication, educators such as Ruelas would still have been evaluated on the criteria of respect and likeability. Is this the yardstick of evaluation that is in the best interest of the students of Miramonte? It certainly would have been more politically correct.
Taking political correctness to the next level, the teachers union has called for a boycott of the Times. The idea that teachers should have their own report cards and accountability made public will now be put to the test. The unfortunate reality in this case is that the students of this school have lost a teacher, and their pain is justified. Family and friends are without someone they care about and their mourning is difficult to bear witness to. However, in the case of suicide, the responsibility falls with the individual, as this is a personal act, and a very selfish one at that.
If this teacher truly killed himself in reaction to a poor teacher evaluation made public, a politically incorrect truth needs to be accepted. It was not a poor evaluation or the Times’ decision to publish it along with other educators’ results that ended the teacher’s life. It was Ruelas’ personal decision to leave this world instead of addressing it that is causing the pain felt by family and friends today. It was his decision to run from a poor performance evaluation instead of improving himself or challenging the criteria by which he was evaluated. In the end, it was a very selfish decision of this teacher to abandon those that held him in such high regard for the false belief in escape. This is an important lesson that the teachers union could be addressing, instead they are obscuring true issues of accountability by evoking political correctness.

A union of two established outfits from the deceased Dead Earth Politics and regional heroes Southern Front, Runescarred are a progressive groove metal outfit from Texas aiming to come out of the gate ablaze through their debut EP We Are. Coming from a thriving music community in Austin, the talent pool is quite high – so it’s always exciting to hear some fresh genre-blends as long as the integrity and songwriting performances are also on par. Fortunately based on this brief outing, Runescarred deliver the goods to a current generation that is craving for some musical muscle to go along with engaging melodies, hooks, and harmonies through a modern context.
The quieter, whispering vocals against acoustic guitars sets up “A Darker Man” from a thoughtful perspective, once the electric crunch kicks in against Ven Scott’s soulful, expressive voice it’s hard not to be entrenched in the proceedings. It’s rare that a band will start with probably their most somber arrangement first, but it sets the stage for the double kick-infused, heads down metal of “This Is Mine”, where there are speedier power chord riffs against staccato-driven triplets, as if Lamb of God goes toe to toe with classic Nevermore (circa Dreaming Neon Black). These musicians never lose sight of placing circular reminders aurally to keep heads bobbing and feet tapping, even with all the advanced harmony action, driving rhythm section passages, and the killer lead tradeoffs. “Ghost Ocean” contains another avant-garde opening riff set against a comfortable tempo, the main verses going back and forth for Ven from passionate pleas and screams to lower bellows depending on the emotional needs that are evident in the moment – plus the Latin flamenco instrumental switch up is a commendable curve ball that works.
At only 15 minutes, We Are leaves the listener teased and tantalized, but desiring more – a great position for Runescarred to be in for the long run. Let’s hope that this is only the beginning of a fruitful, productive career for these gentlemen.

It can be really stressful to try and deal with everything that is associated with your basement on a regular basis. Thankfully, there are a lot of options out there for you to consider when it comes to preventing damage to your basement and whatever is in it. Why should you worry about basement flooding, anyway?
Water damage is some of the most difficult damage to try and deal with, no matter what you’re trying to take care of with it. Taking the time to install a moisture barrier for concrete floor is actually going to prevent that damage because it allows you to prevent water from seeping into and through the floor as well.
Flooding can cause issues with mold  yes, even in spaces where you can’t see it. And too much mold has the potential to make your family very ill if it doesn’t get treated in the proper fashion. There are other health issues that may arise as well, so you want to be sure that you consider what you need to do to take care of flooding before it happens.
As you can see from these, flooding in your basement can do a lot of damage and can actually cost a ton of money in health bills as well. By taking preventative measures and being sure that you’re doing what you can in order to take care of your basement space, you will find that you feel that much more confident and prepared if there is an issue that may cause you problems in the future. Do research and talk to a contractor to see what they recommend in order to prevent damage from flooding.

The never-stopping Olsons are now pausing from time to time to share glimpses of their lives. Enjoy!
I'm pretty sure that this month's Daring Bakers' challenge was created with me in mind. We were challenged to decorate a cake or cupcakes with fondant or gum paste. When I read the challenge brief, I'm pretty sure I smiled from ear to ear and did a little happy dance. Talk about something being right up your alley!! I was so excited about the challenge that I had a hard time falling asleep that night because cake ideas and visions were zooming around in my brain.
Eventually, after considering many designs (including a beach scene, a person soaking in a bubble-filled bathtub, a Lego-theme, and a baking theme), I opted to try a book cake: A William Shakespeare anthology, to be exact. (Yes, I really am THAT big of a literature geek!)
Once again, my artistic director (aka Eric) was a huge help and gets a lot of credit for how this cake turned out. His engineer skills were incredibly beneficial when it came to figuring out how to approach the cake (linear thinking at its best!!) and when it was time to rough out the templates for cutting the cake and bookmark.
My two favorite Shakespearean plays are "Taming of the Shrew" and "Much Ado About Nothing", so we showcased both plays by having the finale of "Shrew" on the left-hand page and he beginning of "Much Ado" on the right page.
This cake makes me smile so very much. It represents my love of literature and how some of my loved ones had a hand in creating it. Can't beat that!!!

From Craigslist ads to breed shows, from auctions to sales barns, finding the perfect horse can feel like a hunt for a needle in a hay-stack — or several different hay-stacks! How do you know which route is best for you?
Are you an amateur or buying your first horse? In these cases, it’s best to go the tried and true route — to established sales barns, with a trusted professional at your side. Many horse enthusiasts are drawn to rescuing down-on-their-luck horses in auction rings and sales pens. Although saving a horse can be thrilling — and feel like an act of altruism — you could be saddled with problems that are a detriment to the health and safety of you and other horses. Horses without proper healthcare or vaccinations can carry infectious disease into a barn without strict quarantine measures — measures that some barns simply might not be able to keep up with.
And buying a horse without any knowledge of its previous training or handling could spell high training costs (or hospital stays!) if you’re not a practiced horse trainer. Bottom line: leave the rescue work to the professionals, and buy your first horse with an eye for quality training, disposition, and health.
Professionals and amateurs alike can benefit from the breeder or the sales barn. Although auctions for sporthorses and sporthorse prospects are still rather rare in the United States, many breeders offer started and showing horses in addition to yearlings and youngstock. One resource for sales barn listings is Exchange Hunter Jumper (http://www.exchangehunterjumper.com/sale_barn/showcase). Finding your next horse could be as simple as researching your favorite bloodlines and finding the nearest quality farm where you can buy them.
Sales barns, on the other hand, might have horses from a variety of backgrounds and breeders. A trainer who specializes in training, showing, and selling horses frequently acts as a broker for buyers and sellers. Very good trainers will be able to match up a horse and rider partnership, and they’ll come with excellent recommendation from happy clients.
If you’ve got what it takes to find a diamond in the rough, though, you might be able to find a bargain through the Internet, especially in towns with large horse breeding populations. Websites based in breeding areas like Ocala, Florida, such as Florida Horse Shows (http://floridahorseshows.org/florida-horse-breeding-farms.php), are often bursting with listings for young horses who aren’t going to cut it in their breeders’ area of expertise. Young Thoroughbreds who aren’t built to race or who aren’t registered are particularly easy to find for a bargain price, even free. Got the experience to train a youngster into a riding horse? The Internet might be your new best friend.
No matter what route you take to finding your next horse, never go it alone! Take a friend (or three) with plenty of equine experience. Everyone will take away something a little differently after looking at a sales horse, and you’ll have plenty to discuss as you drive to the next barn on your list, looking for that perfect new horse.

If you were sent an e-mail then follow the instructions; if you did not receive the e-mail then check that your e-mail address is valid. One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rogue users abusing the board anonymously. If you are sure the e-mail address you used is valid then try contacting the board administrator.
The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the e-mail you were sent when you first registered) or the administrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the latter case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for boards to periodically remove users who have not posted anything so as to reduce the size of the database. Try registering again and get involved in discussions.

The Motorola One Power is wildly different from anything Motorola has released in the past. After all, it’s one of their first non-Droid phones in several years to not have the “Motorola Moto” branding. It also has a different design language, looking way closer to something like an iPhone Xs and featuring a display notch and a cornered dual camera setup. On the software front, however, the developer-friendly stock Android-based software is still alive and kicking—it’s on the Android One program, after all. And those of you looking forward to modding this phone might be excited to know that the kernel source code for the Motorola One Power was recently published to GitHub.
For users, this means that custom ROMs, like LineageOS, as well as custom kernels, should start coming very soon to our official forums. Developers can check out the source code here. The release is for the Android 8.1 Oreo firmware, though the device is poised to get an Android 9 Pie release.
Interview Earlier this year, Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, managing director in the technology division of Morgan Stanley, and a visiting professor of computer science at Columbia University in the US, wrote a letter inviting those overseeing the evolution of the programming language to “Remember the Vasa!”
Easy for a Dane to understand no doubt, but perhaps more of a stretch for those with a few gaps in their knowledge of 17th century Scandinavian history. The Vasa was a Swedish warship, commissioned by King Gustavus Adolphus. It was the most powerful warship in the Baltic Sea from its maiden voyage on the August 10, 1628, until a few minutes later when it sank.
The formidable Vasa suffered from a design flaw: it was top-heavy, so much so that it was undone by a gust of wind. By invoking the memory of the capsized ship, Stroustrup served up a cautionary tale about the risks facing C++ as more and more features get added to the language.
Quite a few such features have been suggested. Stroustrup cited 43 proposals in his letter. He contends those participating in the evolution of the ISO standard language, a group known as WG21, are working to advance the language but not together.
He makes clear that he doesn’t interpret the fate of the Vasa to mean that incremental improvements spell doom. Rather, he takes it as a lesson to build a solid foundation, to learn from experience and to test thoroughly.
With the recent conclusion of the C++ Standardization Committee Meeting in Rapperswil, Switzerland, earlier this month, Stroustrup addressed a few questions put to him by The Register about what’s next for the language. (The most recent version is C++17, which arrived last year; the next version C++20 is under development and expected in 2020.)
Is C++ too challenging for newcomers, and if so, what features do you believe would make the language more accessible?
On the other hand, there are parts of C++ that makes it far more accessible to newcomers than C or 1990s C++. The difficulty is to get the larger community to focus on those parts and help beginners and casual C++ users to avoid the parts that are there to support implementers of advanced libraries.
Also, my “A Tour of C++” can help people get on the right track with modern C++ without getting lost in 1990s complexities or ensnarled by modern facilities meant for expert use. The second edition of “A Tour of C++” covering C++17 and parts of C++20 is on its way to the stores.
I and others have taught C++ to 1st year university students with no previous programming experience in 3 months. It can be done as long as you don’t try to dig into every obscure corner of the language and focus on modern C++.
Some people complained that adding the range-for loop made C++ more complicated, and they were obviously correct because it added a feature, but it made the use of C++ simpler. It also eliminated some common errors with the use of the traditional for loop.
Another example is the C++11 standard thread library. It is far simpler to use and less error-prone than using the POSIX or Windows thread C APIs directly.
Stroustrup: C++11 was a major improvement of C++ and C++14 completed that work. C++17 added quite a few features without offering much support for novel techniques. C++20 looks like it might become a major improvement. The state of compilers and standard-library implementations are excellent and very close to the latest standards. C++17 is already usable. The tool support is improving steadily. There are lots of third-party libraries and many new tools. Unfortunately, those can be hard to find.
The worries I expressed in the Vasa paper relate to the standards process that combines over-enthusiasm for novel facilities with perfectionism that delays significant improvements. “The best is the enemy of the good.” There were 160 participants at the June Rapperswil meeting. It is hard to keep a consistent focus in a group that large and diverse. There is also a tendency for experts to design more for themselves than for the community at large.
Two sweet babes feel very bored when an idea of playing spicy girlish games comes into their minds. So they soon take a 69 position and lick their juicy pussies.
Babysitting my sweet little one-year old (first? second?) cousin today. I know people always talk about how cute babies are (even if they're ugly) but she really is cute.
But, also I had him come over because the Pest Control Guy had to stop by and I had to open the garage door for him and since I'm really paranoid about everything, I was scared to open the door if I was going to be alone. Yes. I'm really that paranoid. Ever since taking a RAD class (self-defense) I have been extremely over-prepared to use my moves, so Pest Control Guy kinda freaked me out.
My dad brought Starbucks (loooveee) and now my cousin is napping. Even though we're about five rooms away from her, we're still whispering. Ha. Ha. Ha.
I TOTALLY know what you're talking about being overly prepared to defend yourself :D I don't like opening the front door if I'm home by myself either and usually don't! That's nice your dad came over and even nicer that he brought some coffee! What a guy@
What makes me happy...well I guess the fact that my cute dog is curled up on my lap while I check the email and write the next blog post. She's so adorable :)
I used to be a freak about locking the doors. Everyone would joke that while they were still on the porch putting on their shoes, they could hear the lock click and me walk away. I've gotten better, though! At my parent's house, when it was dark and I had to let the dogs out, I'd do everything super quick and then run into the front of the house and hide, haha.
Whenever the kids I nanny are napping, I make everyone be quiet all over the house... even though it's a HUGE house. I just don't want to wake them, because those hours are precious! :)
Today, I am happy because there is sunlight coming through my window, and the kid's grandma is here- so I got off early!
I love those little moments when you have to be quiet and still because you don't want to disturb something precious like a sleeping baby in the next room, or the puppy that JUST fell asleep in your lap.

Hi, my name is Frank. When I moved into my new home, I was shocked at the poor performance of the furnace. It would not kick on unless the thermostat was set to full blast. When it did turn on, it barely pumped out enough air to warm up the space directly around the vents. My HVAC contractor helped me understand that a new furnace needed to be ordered right away. The contractor also performed the install and subsequent maintenance procedures. In an effort to help others in a similar situation, my site will cover the process of replacing, maintaining and fixing residential furnaces. Thanks for coming by.
When you are looking at what kind of heating you want to install in your new home, you might consider thinking about radiant floor heating. There are a lot of benefits to going with radiant floor heating.
Radiant floor heating involves either tubes that hold hot water or electrical heating elements underneath your flooring. When the heater turns on, either the elements will heat up or hot water will be forced through the tubes. That heat will heat up the floor, which will then heat up your house. If your floor is made out of cement, then the cement will hold some heat, so when the heater isn't running, the heat will still radiate out from the floor, heating the air above it and then heating your house. There are a lot of benefits to using radiant floor heating.
One benefit of using radiant heating is that you shouldn't have any cold spots. Because the air above the floor gets heated up and then moves up as it gets hotter, letting colder air fall towards the floor for it to be heated up, it keeps any cold spots from forming.
Radiant floor heating takes advantage of something called thermal mass heating. Basically, what thermal mass heating is is a large area of something that gets heated up and then releases the heat when the heating source is no longer active. This is what makes cement flooring or subflooring so good when it comes to radiant floor heating. But, any flooring should act as some kind of thermal mass.
Radiant floor heating helps to save energy because of the fact that it can help with heating up a thermal mass, which means the heater won't have to turn on as often to keep your house at the comfortable level that you are looking for. Not only does that save on energy, it also saves you money, which is always a good thing.
When you are building a new house, you want to make sure that you are making the best choices for you and your needs. This is especially true when it comes to heating. You want to make sure that you and your family are going to be nice and comfortable when it's very cold outside. Radiant floor heating can be a good choice for you because it can save you money and keep you comfortable.

I have a challenge that I’m just now running on, and I have been on the glance out for such information.
Closely following a benchmark decision in the US on cloud music services, Australia is set to host its own cloud storage lawsuit in the Federal Court – with internet service provider Optus pitched against the National Rugby League and Australian Football League.
The Sydney Morning Herald reports that Optus has launched a pre-emptive action designed to show that its TV Now service is not infringing the copyright of the NRL and AFL. The TV Now service allows users to record free-to-air TV programs on Optus’s computer servers (an example of cloud storage) and then view them within 30 days using a web browser.
From the sports bodies’ perspective, the rights to screen the programs in question are sold to broadcasters and internet TV services for large amounts of money, and Optus’ TV Now service is making money from their intellectual property, free of charge. Optus takes the view that it is trading in storage, not content. The court will decide which of the parties is right.
As reported in the Australian Copyright Council’s August News Service, a US court handed down a split decision in a copyright case involving MP3Tunes and EMI Music Group on August 22, which has significant implications for Google, Amazon and others in the burgeoning cloud storage business in the US.
While District Judge William Pauley ruled that MP3Tunes had infringed copyright in relation to certain specific works (referred to in letters from EMI), he also found that for the most part, the service was protected by the US safe harbour rules of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. In addition to relying on the safe harbor provisions for its defence, MP3Tunes also raised questions about whether the storage and streaming of files owned by users needed permission from rights holders in the first place.

The participation of individuals in the securities market of the Albanian government has reached a historical record.
According to data from the Ministry of Finance, in 2016 individuals held 15.04% of the total domestic debt, the highest level ever recorded.
Due to the sharp decline in interest rates on deposits last year, individuals have attempted instead more investments in bonds to benefit from higher interest rates.
In particular, bonds have kept satisfactory interest rates, remaining very attractive for investors during 2016.
In addition to individuals, a considerable weight on the market is held by financial institutions, primarily investment funds, with about 15.3%.
These funds invest mainly in bonds and obligations of individuals, thus, indirectly, we are speaking here about a market share which in most of cases belongs to individuals and this brings their share to over 30%.
According to the Ministry of Finance, commercial banks held 60.29% of domestic debt, from 58.2% that this share was at the end of 2015.
In 2016, the domestic debt of the government of Albania had the value of 561 billion ALL, increasing by 1.8% compared with a year ago.

The new User Maintenance page, available from the Other tab, allows staff with the appropriate permissions to lock and unlock user accounts within the corresponding building.
The release includes a variety of enhancements to the Teacher Connect interface based on district feedback. Teachers can now send emails to individuals or groups from the Student Contact Report. The new check box field allows users to select multiple student and parent email recipients when launching the compose email window. The new Auto Calculate assignment option allows teachers to automatically calculate the overall assignment score based on the scores entered for each associated standard.

Teachers can easily exclude individual or multiple students from assignments using the new Exclude tool. Excluded students will automatically receive a grade of “EX” within the Gradebook. Finally, category defaults have been incorporated into the Settings page within the Teacher Connect Gradebook, allowing staff to define the default category options for all classes.
The Online Registration form has been modified to provide applicants with separate pages dedicated to collecting guardian contact information or emergency contact information.

I bow down to Narasimha, who is the ferocious, valorous, great Vishnu, resplendent with faces in all directions; the One who frightens and also who ensures welfare, and the One who is the death of Death.
He who is having big and round eyes, He who has taken a vow to kill the enemies, He who by His fierce roars is shaking the entire world, to such a ferocious Lord, I offer my salutations. Sarvairavadhyataam praaptam sabalaugham ditessutam
He who with His sharp nails tore to pieces the asura, the son of Diti who could not be killed by anyone along with His large armies. To such a valourous person, I offer my salutations.
I offer my salutations to Maha Vishnu, whose feet touch the nether lands, whose forehead touches the heaven and whose hands spread in all directions.
He after whose luster the luminary bodies, the Sun, the Moon, the Stars and Fire are effulgent and are shining, to that resplendent One I offer my salutations.
To that Form of the Lord, which is half man and half lion, complete with the mane, the canine teeth, to such a divine Lord Nrsimha, I offer my salutations.
By the mere thought of whose name, devils, demons, asuras get frightened, acute diseases get cured, to such a frightening One, I offer my salutations.
I offer my salutations to the Lord, the repository of good things, worshipping whom all the people are able to obtain auspicious things. Saakshaat svakaale sampraaptam satrum satru
He who is "Death to Death" and He who destroys death and hosts of enemies of the devotees by arriving at the right moment, to Him I offer my salutations.
I bow down to the One by offering obeisance to whom in the form of One’s own self, people get rid of all miseries and obtain their desired objects.
All the living beings are, by nature, servants of the Supreme Being, I am prostrating to You, with the awareness that I am also for the same reason, Your servant.
The meaning of the words had been explained by Lord Siva out of affection. Whosoever reads this hymn with faith, thrice a day (at Sunrise, mid-day and evening) would have a great increase in knowledge, longevity and prosperity.
Elena Skoko shares her life, thoughts and discoveries on her nomadic path to motherhood. Memoirs of a Singing Birth is a story of a personal quest for gentle birth that ends up in a rural village in the heart of Bali with the help of midwife Ibu Robin Lim. You will find out how the author succeeds to transform the labor pains into ecstatic birth by using her voice. The book also describes a lotus birth. Above all, this is a magic love story about a woman, a man and their child.

After an ecstatic and singing experience of birth in Bali, assisted by Ibu Robin Lim, Elena Skoko dedicated her life to promoting the idea of birth as luminous and empowering rite of passage to motherhood.

Having squatted beside Elena Skoko as she brought her daughter Earth-side, I feel I have seen Hathor, the Egyptian Goddess of Love, Music and Beauty, roar with her Lion nature. Drunk on tenderness, endearment, lust and devotion, even when she was bent in pain, this woman sang! This book is a love story, spun for all women, read it, give it to your daughters to relish. Elena generously shares her evolution from Maidenhood to Motherhood. She is still so young, yet as a storyteller she is a Crone, a 'keeper of time', a wise one. Ibu Robin Lim
This truly is a beautiful book for anyone with a passion for childbirth, and would make a particularly lovely gift for a pregnant woman. Elena Skoko writes with insight, wisdom and wit about her journey into motherhood, weaving into her birth story a wealth of information about birthing practices, the politics and history of childbirth, and the actual reality of her own birth experience. Milli Hill, The Mule - Top Parenting Blog
Ms. Skoko fortifies the reader to trust in her body, know her options, and seek a more holistic birthing path. I recommend her book for inspiration, education, and empowerment. Nicole D, Bellies and Babies
This is an interesting book to read if you enjoy reading birth stories. I love the inside view of birth in a different culture. It was poetically written, very descriptive and I enjoyed the love story of Elena, Roberto and their baby Koko. Thanks for sharing your birth experience with the world! http://enjoybirth.com/blog/
The book is truly a pleasant read and an inspiration for women who want to birth in their own way. Mamapoekie, http://www.authenticparenting.info
Males range from 23 to 27 mm in length, while females range from 25 to 29 mm. Very similar to Litoria fallax (in fact it wasn't recognized as a separate species until 1969). It has a green dorsal surface and a thin bronze dorso-lateral stripe which begins at the eye (Barker et al. 1995). Often, there is a central bronze band running along the vertebral line of the dorsal surface. A narrow white stripe runs from below the eye at the corner of the mouth to the base of the arm. The ventral surface is cream or yellowish, with a flash of gold in the thighs and groin area. The male throat is flecked with darker color. Skin is granular on the belly and femoral region, but smooth otherwise. The iris of the eye is golden, the tympanum is distinct, vomerine teeth are absent, and there is a strong pectoral fold (Cogger 1996). There are discs on both the fingers and toes, the fingers are slightly webbed, and the fringed toes are about three-quarters webbed. There is an inner but no outer metatarsal tubercle, and the second finger is longer than first (Cogger 1996). The characters which distinguish this species from L. fallax are the thin, bronze lateral stripe, the webbing does not reach the base of the first toe, and body-length to head-width ratio is >3.5 (Cogger 1996; Barker et al. 1995).
Tadpoles may reach up to 55 mm, and appear with a high, crested tail and heavy pigmentation on the fin and muscular region (Barker et al. 1995).
The call is a high-pitched "wree-e-eck pippip," although the second part begins before the first part has ended, and is distinguishable from Litoria cooloolensis and L. fallax only in the first part lasting twice as long in duration (Barker et al. 1995).
This species is endemic to southeastern Iran, where it is known only from the Jaz Murian Depression in Baluchistan (Anderson, 1999). Although it has only been recorded from the type locality, it might be more widely distributed in the Depression where there are suitable patches of habitat. It is found at about 500m asl.

The fallout from Israel Folau's public declaration of his views on homosexuality refuses to go away, despite Rugby's Australia's somewhat pathetic attempts so far.
Folau's comments on social media - that gay people were destined to a life in hell unless they repented for their "sins" - have so far been met with condemnation from all quarters other than from Rugby Australia who, desperate to cling on to their prized asset, have even commented that they "accepted Israel's position".
Absolutely not, especially where such views are so clearly at odds with his employer's public commitment to inclusiveness and the universal values of rugby.

Last November, more than 250 older people from Galway City and County came together as part of the Age Friendly County programme for Galway. The Age Friendly County Programme is a key initiative of the Ageing Well Network – an independent network of leaders and heads of organisation across the public, private and voluntary sectors in the field of ageing who share a vision of Ireland as the best country in the world in which to grow old, and are committed to achieving it.
Following on from a successful Age Friendly Consultation process where over 2,000 older people took part across Galway City, County and the offshore Islands,
organisations are now working with the community to develop an Action Plan which will address the issues that were raised. This action plan will form part of the
Galway Age Friendly Strategy. Feedback from the consultation was presented to over 250 older people who attended a social event in Galway City and a general agreement was made about the priorities for the strategy. Some of the key actions include:
- Developing an Older People Forum and an Executive Committee to allow people to have a say in policy planning and in shaping their communities.
For further details on the Galway City & County Age Friendly Strategy contact Catherine Collum, Age Friendly County Officer on +00 353 91 476514 or email ccollum@galwaycoco.ie

I want to get my two front seats re-upholstered as they’re starting to come apart. Can anyone recommend a good, but affordable marine trimmer who I can drop them off to have done?
E-Romnja is an association established in August 2012 by a group of activists that advocates for a public agenda that must include Roma women’s issues.E-Romnja advocates for the respect, integrity, and dignity of Roma women. Our focus is on working for images of Roma women to reflect the diversity and reality of their lives. Over time, negative images of Roma promoted by media, literature, and even art have had a major impact upon the lives of Roma women,making them invisible and marginalized.They’re voices have yet to be documented – from their experiences as slaves, their inferior position inside their communities and/or families, or the patriarchal system which kept them illiterate, economically dependent, and subjugated to cultural traditions. But most importantly,their invisibility as women has had a major impact upon the policies and programs adopted to improve their situation, which over time reflects the role that they are allowed to have in community and society. This is why we believe that it is important for Roma women to be reflected as they are and to be represented on the public agenda as a first step in asserting their rights.
Because Roma women don't exist on the public agenda and their issues are not solved through government policies. Because Romanian society is dominated by negative perceptions and stereotypes regarding Roma women and we need to dismantle them. Because Roma women need a frame/community to affirm their interests and manifest their beliefs; they need a community that can champion lives and experiences that they can relate and associate with. Because Roma women must be present and visible in public sphere through their contribution in community and/or society. Because Roma women don't have sufficient NGO’s that can stand up for them.
I've tried a couple of Vectra's before, Its always been the older turbo diesel version and so perhaps not the most pleasant version available.
The suspension of the Vectra wasn't great, it was fine on smooth roads and motorways other than its rather basic feeling rear suspension which drew adverse comments from rear seat passengers. But it really was all at sea over rougher twistier roads, when the combination of very limited rev range and power , and the handling of a drunken camel made it a most unpleasant experience.
I cant say I was overly enamored with the interior of the TD Vectra either. These things are all relative to the competition of course and in quantifiable terms the Vectra's a fine perfectly practical modern car, but It lacks that little bit of something special, So much as I tried to like Vauxhalls latest stab at the Middle range market, it kept falling short.
So if we accept that the Vectra is a decent looking and practical car, and its offered with a likely sounding 2.5 litre V6, with its interior upgraded to top of the line CDX spec, then maybe we can stay away from rough roads and finally learn to love the Vectra.
On paper it all looks so promising, Estate body Full leather and wood trim, electric power of a long list of gadgets, Air Conditioning, Heated Seats, Rear load cover, built in dog guard, roof rails anon, anon. If nothing else this Vectra should be extra comfortable and extra practical.
First Appearances are very promising, the Vectra's not a bad looker in Hatchback form, and unlike many, the Estate looks genuinely designed to be one rather than just a hatch back with a fish tank tacked in the back. The roof rails and Alloys add a touch of elegance, though it was disconcerting to find only 195 tyres on the rims, considering the underpowered oil burner runs 185 section rubber.
The Elegant exterior hides a genuinely useful interior, the large square boot, plus split fold rear seats produces space that whilst not as big (read wide) as some of it competitors, is still larger then many of us would ever really use. The Vectra Toes the narrow line between good looking lifestyle estates like the A4 Avant, and the Volumous but dubious looking workhorses like the Mondeo Estate.
The rear dog guard is a great touch for those of us who share our lives with mutts, and being built in it always available and slots securely into the roof stopping frustrated little paws from pulling it down easily.
So we have a great place to stick the dogs, and can take time to look around the CDX, top of the range, cant be bettered, interior. First thing that strikes you is the wood inlays on the dash centre. Or should I say lack of wood inlays, Or should I say that which pretends to be wood smack you right between the eyes like an ice pick, in fact to claim the lumps of plastic look anything like wood at all is stretching it a bit far to say the least. Not only do they not look remotely like wood, but they look far worse than the normal plastics that surround it. The dash is one thing that looks bad but at least you don't have to touch it. The same cant be said for the matching gear knob which not only looks bad but feels bad as well.
The cheesy plastic brown stuff at least diverts your attention from the fact that very little has been done to the Dash. The same fussy clocks are still there. The same steering wheel wrapped in a thin leather sheath. There's a plethora of new added buttons of course, a big air con unit, and a large enhanced trip computer in the radio clock display, but there's no extra clocks and no disguising the cheap Vectra under pinnings.
Leather seats , hmm , Leather seats? Well yes they are seats , and yes they are leather covered . But it looks like Vauxhall took the standard Vectra Seats and had you granny cover them with the thinnest cheapest Leather that its buyers could find after scouring the entire known Universe. There's also a small bit of Leather on the door panels, but really, after you've sampled the out break of leather in Vauxhalls own Calibra this really starts to look very disappointing.
None of its going to kill you, its all fairly comfortable, its just so cheesy and low rent that it really grates on your sensibilities .
The whole interior has a feeling about it that suggests it was created by a new designer, with little real skill or experience, who just worked too hard to create something special. Take a look at the centre arm rest which looks like an Alien head dreamed up by HR Geiger , would a normal rectangular box with a slot for the handbrake not look so much better. Adding lots more gizmos doesn't so much make it look like a dogs dinner, as a dogs breakfast, dinner, tea and supper.
It may irritate you, but you can live with the interior if the driving experience is any kop. Making the biggest impression on the driving experience in this car is of course the 2.5 litre V6 quad cam motor.
Does it sound a little over the top, is there really any need/call for a Vectra estate to run 138mph and 0 to 60 in 8.5 seconds.
Course there is, if for no other reason than because they can , progress marches relentlessly on no matter how much the anti car Luddites want to freeze us in time. So okay the 140 top end is purely academic for most of us but there is still no law about how fast you can get to 70 (yet!).
Those figures suggest prodigious top end power , but that's only a small part of the story from this car. Its not the published figures but the way the V6 unit performs at every rev point, in each gear at all times. From the moment you start to release the light clutch, and it begins to bite, you realize there's little need to rev it much at this point as the unit has decent torque from tick over onwards. But its already straining at the leash awaiting its freedom. Until the road clears its a strong, smooth, honest, fuss free unit and will trickle along in high gears without so much as a Murmur. When the opportunity arises though its persona changes, it revs hard and happily from nothing to red line firing the Vectra along at a most invigorating rate. The engines harnessed to a normal GM five speed box. The box is easy enough if a little notchy into each gear, its not particularly nasty change just not anything to write home about.
Make use of the box and you can make the Vectra really fly, bouncing the V6 off the redline. Whilst the modest capacity Quad cam 24 valve Engine will happily do the tacho tango, that's not really the way to enjoy its output, best way is to roll gently out of a tight bend pulling minimal revs in third gear, and then bury the throttle and feel the Vectra charge right round the clock, like its being pulled by a giant elastic band. It was amusing to watch and follow at safe distance a Renault Megane Coupe and a Jaguar XJ6 jockeying through traffic, around a round about and on to a dual carriage way. It was easy to keep pace just using the flexibility of third, and even more amusing to see their faces as a Vectra Estate eased past just slipping into fourth gear.
It really is a nice power unit it even has a decent sound track sounding like a (very) muted motorcycle, It has a really tight, responsive feel, constantly feeling like your holding it back, Its high revving yet strong on torque low down. Its not quite as smooth as a small bore Audi Six but it doesn't feel as flat as one either.
I didn't have the chance to take the Vectra Estate on the rough switching back roads that may be its nemesis, so for now we will give it the benefit of the doubt and hope Vauxhall have tweaked a little more than the 195 tyres. On smooth roads it all feels standard Vectra right down to the dull thudding rear suspension. With the diesel Vectra you have to try to keep cornering speed up to make up for the all (and that isn't much) or nothing Motor. At least with the V6 you can ease around the bends and then Gas it down the straights, So you may even find that the engine makes it feel better down the twisties just because you don't have to place as much reliance on the chassis.
The Vectra is a perfectly practical Estate and whilst the interior maybe an eyesore, its a comfortable place to sit. Its also not the kind of Interior that your really going to baulk at putting big, nasty, dirty loads into because its too posh. The engine though is a beaut, a real treat in any car, the only shame here is its shackled to one of the most mediocre chassis in the Vauxhall range. Now If it was attached to something more interesting like a Calibra or an Omega, then we would really be talking.

This unique preserve in Gulf Breeze has it all – shoreline, coastal woodland, pines, fresh­water ponds…and the chance to see birds in varied habitats.
Meet in the Office Depot parking lot across from Gulf Breeze Hospital at 7:30 a.m., or in the tiny parking area at the Preserve. To reach the Preserve, drive east from Office Depot on US 98 and measure 1.23 miles beyond the Walmart stoplight.
Turn right on Soundside Drive and go .44 mi to the Preserve on your right. The morning trip will be led by Michael and Cathy Brower and will finish before lunchtime.
Field trips are open to the public and free of charge, but contributions are appreciated. All experience levels are welcome. Bring binoculars and/or a spotting scope. Sun­screen, insect protection, appropriate shoes, hat, water, and snacks or lunch are recommended on all trips.
Please refrain from wearing scented cologne, perfumes or after­shave on field trips. It distracts from the experience in nature, and some participants are highly sensitive to it. Carpooling is encouraged, as is sharing gas expenses with the driver.
Birds and their habitats are under attack. With your help, we can fight back. We can protect birds and the places they need – as long as we have people like you who will donate.

Our last day in Greece was to be relatively uneventful. We had a few possible stops planned, but decided in the morning to just go to one to save stress. This is good, because I was in pain by this point. Just stepping off a curb was making me wince, let alone walking down from our third floor hotel room.
We set out in the rental car and after about 2 hours drive came to Vergina. (That’s pronounced “ver-GEE-na,” by the way.) The archaeological site there was only discovered in 1977 to be the burial site of no less than Philip II of Macedon. For those of you a bit fuzzy on your ancient history, that would be the father of Alexander the Great. The tombs were under a large hill called “The Great Tumulus.”
The museum there now was constructed in a fairly ingenious way – the hill was left intact over the tombs, and the museum simply constructed in the empty space inside after the excavations. So you’re wandering around looking at exhibits just feet from the actual mausoleums. And the exhibits include, among other things, the actual box containing Philip II’s bones. It’s quite the experience. Sadly, no photography allowed.
Afterwards, we stopped of for lunch at a little taverna in the middle of nowhere. It dawned on Leigh and I that in eleven days, neither of us had actually ordered a “Greek Salad” per se, so we did just that. This was not the sort of place that normally gets foreign tourists, but the owners were just as friendly to us as everyone else had been, and yet another plate of free fruit appeared after the meal.
On returning to Thessaloniki, it was time for another bit of sheer terror, as we had to negotiate a non-trivial number of crowded, insane major streets, followed by a number of tiny, packed, one-way streets to get to our hotel. But we made it, checked in, returned the rental car, and spent the rest of the day just bonking around the town. We had dinner in a restaurant with carved figures over the windows.
The food was very good, but part of me suspects we may have eaten in the Greek equivalent of a T.G.I. Friday’s. At least we didn’t eat in the ACTUAL T.G.I. Friday’s on Aristotle square. We did walk back down to the waterfront and did some people-watching. We also saw our final sunset in Greece.
Since nothing happened on day 12 but travel (over 24 solid hours of it), I’ll include our only picture from that day here, without comment.
We have actually not yet mentioned WHY, out of all the small Greek towns starting with a “K”, we chose to meet in Kalabaka. [Ed. by Leigh: You’ll notice Dan and I don’t agree on how to spell the name of the town. Neither does anyone else. Some say Kalabaka, some say Kalambaka, and our hosts, who live there, spelled it Kalampaka.] Kalabaka is the site of some fairly exceptional geology. It’s home to a series of enormous sandstone pillars, somewhat similar to Monument Valley in the US.
So imagine you are a Greek person in the Middle Ages, and you are confronted with these impossibly high piles of geology. What would you naturally immediately decide to do? Why, put a monastery on as many of them as possible, that’s what.
There were as many as twenty monasteries here at one time. Over the years, most have returned to ruins, but there are still six in good shape. According to tradition, the first monk to found a monastery here was carried to the top of the rock by an eagle. Seems as good an explanation as any. Lord knows I wouldn’t want to try to climb one of these things without modern safety equipment.
The advantage, from the monks’ point of view, was not only spiritual seclusion, but also security from Ottoman and other intruders. For most of their history, you could only reach the monasteries by being hauled up in a rope net. On being asked how often they replaced the rope, a monk is reputed to have answered: “Only when it breaks.”

In the early 1900s, a bishop who was unhappy that his personal safety on visits was entirely in the hands of monks who may, or may not, have actually liked him, demanded that steps be cut in the rocks of the remaining 6 monasteries. So stairs it was.
Lots and lots of stairs. Nearly a thousand all told. This is a big enough deal that when the owner of our hotel gave us a map and a guide the night before, he actually wrote the number of stairs at each monastery on our map, to allow us to plan our climbs. Oh, and did I mention I climbed a mountain the day before? And that it was roughly one hundred degrees out? This was going to hurt.
Over the course of the day, we managed to visit four of the six monasteries. We couldn’t find a good place to park for the fifth, and ran out of time on the sixth. We also returned to town to get lunch, and then again later to stock up on water.
There are actually four monasteries visible in this panorama, the large one near the bottom, a smaller one right above it, and one on either side of the apparent notch on the right side. At this point, you may be wondering why you haven’t seen many pictures of the inside of the monasteries. The problem is, they mostly didn’t allow photography. Each one had a chapel in varying sizes, and all were beautifully decorated. But no pictures, sorry.
This is a courtyard in the Grand Meteoro, the largest of the monasteries. This is also the one where we glanced through the window in a random door and saw a room with rows and rows of skulls on shelves. Yes, skulls. It was quite disturbing.
This one, the Monastery of the Holy Trinity was the site of the final scene of For Your Eyes Only, one of the least worst of the Roger Moore Bond films.
After we used up our stamina, (and by this point I could barely move my legs) we returned to the hotel for a bit to relax, and then went out to a little ouzeria on the outskirts of town that had been recommended by our guidebook. We had wanted to go there for lunch, but the guidebook also completely biffed on which side of town it was on, so we couldn’t find it. We happened across it randomly later on. I suspect the handy number 23 bus may also go there.
At any rate, the folks there were once again so happy to have visitors that they brought us free of charge a fantastic plate of spicy feta spread and eggplant dip to go with the tzatziki sauce we ordered.
Saturday morning was the end of the conference, marked as always by everyone carrying their luggage around with them at the session. (Side note to whoever stole my poster tube: Really? It was a cardboard tube. It wasn’t even a fancy hardshell poster tube. But anyway, I hope you’re enjoying my cardboard poster tube.)
The new new new new plan for the day was that I would take a bus down to Kalampaka and meet Dan there. This was a great plan, except that it involved me taking a bus to Kalampaka and meeting Dan there. (I’m kidding. Mostly the whole thing went pretty smoothly, with only one major hitch.)
After the conference-provided lunch (which of course involved feta cheese), I jumped on a local bus headed to the regional bus terminal. I had been warned about how the bus terminal worked, so I was mostly prepared for the madness, but not entirely. There were labyrinths of windows at which you could purchase a ticket, and each window had a sign above it listing the places that that particular window sold tickets to. I wasn’t sure if I needed to find the window for Kalampaka or for Trikala, as I knew I was going to have to change buses in Trikala. I wandered around until I found the correct sign — luckily, for both towns. I bought my ticket and settled into a seat to wait for the bus. As I waited, I inhaled at least two packs worth of cigarette smoke; it seemed like everyone around me was chain smoking in anticipation of (I hoped) not being able to smoke on the bus.
The bus was a modern coach bus, like the kind you would charter for a trip, complete with air conditioning and Greek pop music being blasted through the overhead speakers. The trip to Trikala was pretty, as we went through hills near the coast for part of the way. It was also mostly uneventful, except for the half an hour we sat on the highway because there was a car on fire in front of us. The only other odd thing was that while the bus driver had checked our tickets when we boarded, at one point he pulled over on the highway to pick up a woman standing by the side of the highway wearing an official-looking uniform. The woman got on the bus, the driver pulled back onto the highway, and the woman proceeded to check everyone’s ticket on the bus. When she finished, the driver pulled back off to the side of the highway, where she got off and stood there as the bus pulled away. Random ticket inspection? Normal? No idea.
We arrived at Trikala, a lovely modern facility in the middle of nowhere, about a half hour late. I was worried that I’d missed the bus to Kalampaka, and it turned out I had … but there was another one in 40 minutes. So 40 minutes later, I’m off on another coach bus. This one was a little different: unlike the first bus, which left point A and didn’t stop until we got to point B, this bus actually went through small towns and stopped at bus stops along the way, picking up people and dropping them off, so even though it was the same kind of coach/tour bus as the last, it was a lot more like a city bus. At one point we drove past a small park and there were two horses wandering around in the park. This did not appear to be an unusual thing.
It was at this point that I realized that I had NO idea where our hotel was in Kalampaka. The directions I had only indicated that it was on the street to the old Byzantine church. This, however, was not enough information. I ended up getting off the bus FAR too early, and walked across the entire town asking anyone and everyone on the way where I was going. I had the street name, but it was transliterated into English, so when I showed it to people they didn’t recognize what street I was looking for. I finally came across a very nice pharmacist who, through a mix of English and (his excellent, my horrifically substandard) French, understood what I was looking for and then walked me through a neighborhood until we came to a major street that intersected the street I needed. It turned out, of course, that the bus I had been on actually terminated about 150 meters away from where the hotel was, and if I’d just stayed on the bus longer (or, you know, looked at Google Maps for where the hotel was) I would have been fine.
Dan had already checked in and was waiting for me at the bus terminus, where I was supposed to have been arriving. Through the magic of public wi-fi, we found each other. Our plan was, in total, “Dan drives and Leigh takes a bus to Kalampaka, and we meet up somehow.” We’re still kind of amazed that worked.
At six AM the lights in the refuge were unceremoniously turned on, so it was time to go climb a mountain! After a quick breakfast, I left as fast as possible so as to have some time away from the students.
Mount Olympus is on the east coast of the Greek mainland, with the Adriatic to the east. There were low clouds, so I couldn’t see the sunrise directly, but I still had some great views of the reflections on the water.
There will likely be a LOT of pictures in this post. I’ll try to think of something interesting to say about all of them, but let’s be honest – they speak for themselves a lot better than I can.
As I got higher above the refuge, the clouds started to roll in. Below me. They were moving astonishingly quickly – it was almost like watching the surf come in.
Rounding a curve into the final valley, I was completely alone – I don’t know where the guy in the last picture went, but I didn’t see him for half an hour at least.
It’s hard to see, but that silhouette is a mountain goat. Four of them started well above me, and crossed the path behind me to reach the bottom of the valley as I continued to climb. This was the most demanding part of the ascent – I’d estimate the grade at thirty to forty percent.
When you reach the top, it actually comes as a bit of a shock – from below, it looks like the rest of the slope, but when you get there, you realize it’s a sheer drop off the other side, so you must have arrived!
A word about the geography. Olympus is what is technically known as a massif, meaning that there are a number of different peaks. The first one you reach, from which the view above was taken, is called Skala. It’s the third highest peak. On the left of the picture is Skolio, the second highest, and on the right is Mytikas, the highest. Mytikas is a far more difficult climb than the other two, and many climbers opt to skip it. Including me.
Instead, I turned left, and headed for Skolio. By this time, the high school students had caught up with me. It’s not JUST that they were in better shape – they also had a guide who managed to find a way around the 40 percent grade I mentioned earlier.
At the top of Skolio, there’s a log book to sign. I wrote “What an amazing trip. I wish Leigh were here too.”
By this point, almost all of the high school students had made it to the top, and it was starting to feel a bit like rush hour.
Mindful that I had a five hour or so walk down to the car, it was all too soon time to head down. The walk down was just as uneventful as one might hope, and just as beautiful as the way up.
After two hours or so, I reached the refuge and had lunch. On resuming my descent, I passed the same mule train coming up that I had encountered on its way down yesterday. Every ounce of gas that had powered my wifi the previous evening had been schlepped up to the refuge by one of these sturdy little critters.
Upon reaching the parking lot, it was time to meet up with Leigh – but not back in Thessaloniki. In another hare-brained scheme, we had decided that she would take a bus and meet me in Kalimbaka. So I got in the car and headed out. Passing the ranger station on the way out, there was no sign of nice ranger lady. There was, however, a flock of ten or so goats milling around and standing on the fence to reach leaves. I hope they didn’t eat her.
At this point, I made a fatal error – I trusted the GPS a bit too much, and ended up taking a route that was at least an hour longer than optimal. Instead of spending most of the drive to Kalimbaka on a nice interstate-style highway, I first drove through crowded, twisty, narrow downtown streets in Katerini, and then spent three hours on twisty, switchbacky country roads. Fun to drive on, but not “I’d sure like to do this for a whole extra hour!” fun. Stupid GPS.
Also, I had to wait at one point for an enormous flock of goats to cross the road. That was actually sort of awesome. Wish I had a picture. I found our hotel in Kalimbaka, checked in, and settled down with the parrot in the town square to wait for Leigh’s arrival.
I still had a conference to go to, so while Dan braved the untamed roads of Greece in a rental car, I went to more conference during the day.
Friday evening, though, was marked by the Gala Banquet, which was at a restaurant on a pier in downtown Thessaloniki. My sister from another mother, Vicky, and her partner Oscar and I went together and sat together, and were soon joined by another proud member of the redhead brigade, Erin Hannon, and her husband.
As far as banquets go, this was … well, it was one of them. My dinner was a piece of lasagna that was the size of a paperback book, and my dessert was a piece of chocolate cake that was not much smaller. The best part of the dinner was … well, let’s just say that Erin earned the nickname “The Wine Whisperer”. Any time our table ran low on wine, Erin found ways of rectifying that situation.
After the dinner came the socializing, which is, of course, the most important part of the banquet. Our whole party was seated outside, so everyone started wandering around on the pier. It was also the night of the Olympics opening ceremonies, which for some reason the restaurant was projecting on an outer wall without sound; this made for a very bizarre experience as everyone was trying to guess what was going on in the ceremony. (“Why are there miners? Why are there dancing nurses? What is Kenneth Branagh doing?”)
As the evening ran down, I found myself engaged in a fascinating conversation with a lovely Irish fellow about the finer points of the new Doctor Who up to the end of series 5. (He was wonderful and didn’t spoil any of series 6 for me.) The young crowd went out for karaoke, but this old girl went back to the hotel; probably just as well, since I heard from my wild Irish Whovian the next day that he didn’t get back to the hotel until about 6 am.
Leigh had to return to her conference, but I had an even MORE harebrained plan: I was going to climb Mount Olympus. Yes, THAT Mount Olympus. Home of Zeus and all that. Incidentally, the ancient Olympic games were in Olympia, which is a completely different part of Greece.
The scariest part of the undertaking was the first part, namely renting a car. The Greeks seem to regard driving as a competitive sport, and they’re very enthusiastic about it. Add to that the fact that Thessaloniki has tiny streets and a lot of construction underway, and you’ve a recipe for a truly terrifying twenty minutes or so before I got out onto the interstate.
After that it was a very uneventful drive to the national park. I stopped at the small tourist town at the foot of the mountain for lunch, and then started the drive in. There’s two possible routes – you can park in the town and have an eight hour hike to the shelter, or drive partway up the mountain and hike for three hours. I opted for the latter, given the time constraints, and the fact that I am getting older and out of shape.
Just a few kilometers up the road was an entrance station, where a nice ranger lady gave me a map, and made sure I had plenty of water. The road up the mountain was switchbacky, but didn’t have a lot of sheer drops, so it was actually quite fun in the rental stickshift. I stopped partway up to visit yet another monastery.
The final parking lot, Prionia, is at about 1100 meters elevation, and has a little taverna where I got more water. After my experience on Athos, I was very worried about dehydration, but it turned out not to be a problem this time out. I stopped to sign the log on a small cache hidden near the parking lot, then started up the mountain.
I knew it was supposed to be a three hour climb from the parking lot to the refuge where I intended to spend the night, but it was a bit cooler than it had been at sea level, and the temperature mercifully continued to drop as I climbed. It was quite steep in places, and I took a lot of breaks. But it was hard NOT to keep stopping, as the view just got better and better.
At about the two hour mark, I started faintly hearing bells. Bells? I wasn’t completely sure at first – it was right on the edge of hearing. But over time, it became more and more obvious that I was, indeed hearing bells. I correctly inferred that I was probably being approached by a mule train. And I was right.
I have video too, but it’s a bit larger than I can post here. After allowing the mules to pass, I resumed my climb and finally made it to the hiking refuge at about 2,100 meters. There were a number of other people there, including a group of about 20 American high school students. They were just as noisy as you might expect, but nice kids, and it was good to have someone to talk to in English. The refuge served tasty basic food, and got a fire going, which was appreciated, because I was absolutely soaked through with sweat. I also bought a T-shirt, just so I had something dry to put on.
This was the view from the refuge as the sun was setting behind me. They turned the power on for a few hours, and there was even WiFi, so I could let Leigh know I was still alive. At 10 PM sharp, the lights went out, and we turned in to get ready for the final climb in the morning.
Thursday found Leigh and I reunited in Thessaloniki, and ready to actually SEE some of the city that Leigh had been in for three days now. After a bit of conference in the morning, we hopped the bus into town from the hotel, and wandered around in search of things to look at. [Edited by Leigh: I should point out that I was not skipping out on the conference; there was a free afternoon scheduled in!]
Like Athens, Thessaloniki has these amazing juxtapositions of two thousand year old ruins sandwiched in between modern buildings. That’s a triumphal arch erected by the 4th century Roman emperor Galerius. It’s about three feet from one of the busiest streets in downtown. Nearby is the Rotunda:
This structure has, like many others in Greece, followed the pattern of ancient construction, followed by orthodox church, followed by Mosque, followed by an orthodox church again, followed by a museum. Next week, it may be a yogurt factory, who knows?
We hadn’t seen enough cylindrical buildings yet, so we headed down to the waterfront to check out the best known landmark of Thessaloniki, the White Tower. Turns out, it’s beige.
There was a very nice little museum inside on the history of Thessaloniki, but because of the tiny rooms and stifling heat, we didn’t have the patience to look at every single exhibit all the way through. We did pretty well, and were rewarded with a nice view from the top.
We spent the remainder of the afternoon not going to museums. Each museum we reached had a closing time shortly after we reached it, so instead we continued bonking around the city. We had a seat in Aristotle Square, which looked like this.
One neighborhood we had considered visiting is the upper town, which our guidebook had told us could be reached by the “handy number 23 bus.” We spent quite a bit of time trying to determine where we could find this allegedly handy bus. However, we never saw the thing. And since the museums were closed, we just sort of walked around the city, found the occasional geocache, and had more fun with panorama mode.
This was Thessaloniki’s version of the Roman forum, similar to the one we visited in Athens. By this point, we were getting tired, so we decided to find one more cache, and then figure out where to have dinner. We stumped over another street or two, found the cache, and then leaned against a wall near a municipal building we dubbed The Ministry of Silly Walks. While I was trying to determine where some of the restaurants in our guidebook were located, Leigh piped up, “Hey look! It’s a Number 23 bus!.” [Edited by Leigh: I’d like to point out that the handy number 23 bus was, at the time, going up an impossibly small street with cars parked on both sides. We’d been walking up and down major streets trying to find any trace of this purportedly handy bus for rather some time at that point, and it was pure serendipity that we happened to be on the right tiny street to find it.]
At least we found the silly thing. (Note: this photo was not taken with my cell phone) And a good thing too, because it turns out the views from the upper town are stunning. We went and had a gander at the old Byzantine wall.
There’s theoretically a cache next to the tower there, too, but we couldn’t find it, because an amorous couple had parked themselves on the observation platform, and made out continuously for the 20 minutes we were in the vicinity. It was actually hilarious – other tourists kept walking up right next to them and checking out the view, and they didn’t even come up for air. We managed with difficulty to restrain ourselves from doing the same [ed. by Leigh: walking up to them, not giving each other CPR for a half an hour][Speak for yourself – Dan], and settled for a picture.
We found a great little terrace restaurant nearby. The funny thing about this place was that the restaurant was on one side of a busy street, and the terrace where we ate was on the other, so there was a constant flow of waiters dodging cars while bringing people their food. Not a normal occupational hazard at Chili’s, one imagines.
The menu included a lamb special that sounded very tasty, and something our waiter described as “Octopus Burgers.” Well – who could resist that? Turns out octopus burgers are actually very much like crab cakes – breaded and fried, but with octopus instead of crab.
While Dan was on his way back to Thessaloniki, I continued being a dutiful conference attendee. In fact, this was the day when I had to give my presentation and my poster. In a format new to me (and to many others), the conference had scheduled the vast majority of papers to be presented as posters and given the researchers a “speed-poster presentation” time, in which we were to present the general idea of our paper in 5 minutes. Some people were more successful at this than others. (Here’s a general hint: if you have 27 slides, you’re probably not going to get through them all in 5 minutes.)
My speed presentation went well, I thought, and then I had good turnout and feedback at the poster session itself, where I stood by the poster and chatted with interested people. My poster ended up being on the wing closest to the coffee break area, so I got a mix of genuinely interested people and people who were just bored enough to come wandering over.
Dan made it back from Athos in the afternoon (and if you haven’t read his recap of the day, be sure to read the next post!), and we went out to dinner with my friend Rich Randall, who recommended a wonderful little place in a tiny alley in downtown Thessaloniki. He’d been there the night before, so we felt bad making him go back to the same place, but it was worth it! We shared some fantastic roasted peppers and some delicious spicy cheese dip to start, and I had steamed mussels that were amazing. We also had a lovely after dinner surprise when the waiter offered us an ice cream crepe for free.
If I had chosen to join the monks for their entire morning service the next morning, I would have needed to be at the church at 4AM, and remained there until 8 or 9. I’m sure it would have been a unique experience, but I suspect I would have nodded off, and that probably would not have been respectful. Instead, I got up at about 6:30 and started walking towards the next monastery.
This is the view looking back towards Gregoriou from the path to the next monastery, Simonas Petra. This path was much better maintained than yesterday’s, and didn’t involve nearly as much of what the French refer to as “deleveling,” and what normal people refer to as “oh crap, more hills.” Which is not to say there weren’t some spectacular hills, just that they weren’t QUITE as strenuous. Plus, it wasn’t midday, which helped.
Now here’s a bit of geocaching geekery. I won’t go into gruesome detail here, but geocaching is basically a hobby where people hide small packages all over the world, and then post their location online for others to try and find. On the path up to this particular monastery, there actually IS a geocache. Given the difficulty of reaching the spot, I suppose it’s not surprising that the cache had been there for two years, and I was the first person to actually find it. So, yeah – first to find. On a two-year-old cache. In Greece. Here’s the view from near the spot where I found it.
That’s a pretty amazing building. There’s a little bit of scaffolding visible for some renovations going on, but the key point is that when the scaffolding isn’t there – those balconies still are. In fact, that’s the ONLY way to access some of the rooms, via the balconies over the sheer drop. How’s that fear of heights working out for you?
One note about all these pictures. I brought a camera with me to Greece, really I did. But the fact of the matter is that my phone is now a much better camera than my camera. So the poor actual camera never came out of the case. Instead, every picture on this blog was taken with my phone, which had features I was still discovering as the trip progressed. Like, for instance, panorama mode:
This is a view from slightly above the monastery. My original plan had been to continue walking up the coast to Daphni, but after the previous day’s experience, and a report that the path to Daphni was pretty much a dusty road the whole way, I opted instead to walk down to Simonas Petra’s boat dock and wait for the ferry. It was a little worrisome, because the buildings around the dock are all unoccupied, and the cement dock itself has some big holes in it, so you can’t help but worry if you’re in the right place until the boat actually comes. Here’s the view from the dock back up to the monastery:
I should mention that while I was staying in Gregoriou, I met Andreas, a young Greek boy, probably about eleven, who was traveling with his father. Andreas attends an English-speaking school, and was very keen to practice his language skills by chatting with me. I saw him again on the ferry from Simonas Petras to Daphi, and we ended up talking the whole way back. And then again for the 2 hour ferry ride from Daphni to Oranoupolis. His father didn’t speak English, but his son would translate for him. For the most part we just talked to each other. In typically eleven-year-old fashion, he was all over the place, but a really bright kid.
As I was preparing to get off the ferry in Oranoupolis, I asked Andreas’ father where I needed to wait to catch my bus, and he said, “Oh, I’ll be happy to give you a ride back to Thessaloniki.” So that’s how I found myself in a private van, with Andreas, his dad, another person whose name I didn’t catch, and two monks for the ride back to Thessaloniki. They dropped me, other guy, and the monks off on the outskirts, and we all took the bus back into town.
While Dan was traipsing around Mount Athos (see below post), I was being a good academic and attending my conference. I’ll refrain from blogging about the individual papers; if you want to read a recap of some of the papers you can go to Vicky’s excellent Music Psychology blog where she summarizes the papers she attended (which were most often not the ones I attended), except when she accidentally oversleeps.
In the evening, I tagged along with a large group of folks who were affiliated with Goldsmith’s Music, Mind and Brain group; one of their students had lived in Thessaloniki, and took us to one of her favorite haunts. So at least thirty people descended upon this poor, empty, hapless taverna all at once; it was quite entertaining to watch their faces as the two fellows behind the bar realized that there was no way they were going to be able to handle us themselves. Out came the cell phones, and ten minutes later there were two more people frantically working behind the bar.
Vicky and I shared some delicious fried cheese (not a surprise) and a plate of mushrooms. There was lots of beer and lots of chatting with old and new friends. At some point in the evening, one of the bar staff offered me a drink; I told him I hadn’t ordered it, and he said, “I know, just take it. No charge.” So I did, and it turned out to be tsipouro — the anise-flavored kind that is similar to ouzo. Now, I am fully expecting to incur the wrath of quite a few of my college friends here, but I do not like ouzo. (It’s not one of those “bad experiences” stories; it’s the “I just can’t stand the flavor of anise” story. Confession: I never drank it back then, either, guys — I just got really creative about how I would dump it out.) So instead I offered the drink to Daniel Müllensiefen, who had an empty glass and looked as though he was unhappy about that situation. Everyone’s problem solved.
When Vicky finished salsa dancing (oh, did I not mention the loud salsa music they were playing all night?) she and I headed back to the hotel at what would have been a decent hour to go to bed, if my brain hadn’t decided that now was the perfect time for me to have insomnia. And of course, why wouldn’t it be? I only had to give a presentation in the morning, so of course it was the best time for my brain to keep me awake until 3 am watching Lethal Weapon subtitled in Greek.

Vena hotel is always open for guests of the city. Nine comfortable rooms of a classical style are equipped with all necessary for rest. Nice view of the city will charm you in the morning. The hotel guests will appreciate a luxury room.
In each room you will find air conditioner, refrigerator, telephone, cable TV, showers with hydromassage.
The new restaurant Vena offers a huge hall of 350 square meters with 200 seats, an elegant aristocratic interior. Classical European cuisine, dishes, the chef will leave nobody indifferent.
The pattern is May Basket, a 1947 Kansas City Star pattern, according to the Encyclopedia. Those basket blocks measure 9” square. The total quilt measures 68” x 80”. It is hand pieced and tied. The orange plaid that is used for the sashing is also used in 2 side borders. The quilt is bound with wide pieces of fabric turned over from the backing. There is no batting. Some of the hand-stitched seams have pulled loose and I'll be repairing those.
The fabrics! I found one little scrap that was definitely from the early 1900s, lots of pieces from every decade from 1930 through the 60s. There is polyester and there is cotton, there are blends.
Love the chopped off baskets, top and bottom. Love the freedom and exuberance. A refreshing remedy to those who take all of this too seriously.
A while back, my friend Marla gave me a small Sunbonnet Sue quilt. She said the memories she associated with it were not good and she didn't care what I did with it. I was careful to ask her, "You don't care what we do with it?" NO, she assured me. "Do you KNOW what we do with Sunbonnet Sue quilts?" She said she really didn't care, whatever we did would not bother her.
So we've done it again. This one has become Sue Breaks Bad. We showed it at our recent quilt show. As usual, some viewers said nothing (which meant they might have been following the old adage of if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all ... ). Others were loudly enthusiastic, admiring what Sue has been up to lately. There were 12 golden opportunities for Sue to go bad. Swearing Sue, Tattoo Sue, a Phelps family Sue ... Here are some of my favorites:
Got a Sue quilt you are tired of? We still have ideas, send it our way ... Blocks were enhanced by: Linda Frost, Kathe Dougherty, Barbara Brackman, Georgann Eglinski, Carol Jones, Sara Chappell, and myself.
what a hoot - much much much better! I love that little tv set. I think zombie sue needed some blood and lost limbs...
What fun! I remember the "Sun Bonnet Sue Gets Whacked" quilt many years ago that drew ire from traditional quilters. Keep it up!

There are several different varieties of onion, red, yellow, white, and green, each with their own unique taste, from very strong to mildly sweet.
Onions can be eaten raw, cooked, fried, dried or roasted such a wonderful healthy vegetables.Onions are a very good resource of vitamins B6 and C, chromium, biotin, and fiber. They are also a good foundation of folic acid and vitamins B1 and K. The health benefits provided by onions are frequently due to their content of several natural sulfur compounds. To help remain your blood free of clots, and make the most of the health benefits of onions, have them both raw and cooked.
There are many good health benefits concerned with onions. A regular diet including onions cans poorer cholesterol levels and high blood pressure. This can help to prevent atherosclerosis and diabetic heart disease.Onions can also decrease the risk of heart attack and stroke.Other interesting facts concerning onions are that onion extracts are good at relieving coughs and colds, asthma, and bronchitis. Onions also include thiosulfinates that reduce the symptoms of diabetes. Colorful onions, such as red or yellow, contain the most thiosulfinates. It is best to eat onions raw or lightly cooked since heat diminishes thiosulfinates.
Onions contain sulfides which might inferior blood lipids and blood pressure. They are helpful against osteoporosis. In osteoporosis, they obliterate osteoclasts so that they don't break down bone.
Onions have a variety of medicinal effects. Its treat colds, coughs, and asthma, and to resist insects. In Chinese medicine, onions have been used to treat angina, coughs, bacterial infections, and breathing problems.
Onions are great for the health and have many important health benefits. Onions can prevent and reduce the risks of many diseases and work as a natural medication. Given lower are the major health benefits of onions.
They are helpful against osteoporosis. In osteoporosis, they destroy osteoclasts so that they don't break behind bone.
Onion’s pungency increases blood exchange and causes sweating, beneficial in cold damp weather to defend beside infection, reduce fevers, and sweat out colds and cold.

This week’s post comes from Jingya Guo, a graduate student in the History and Museum Studies program
As a new graduate student of Museum Studies so far, I can always notice shifts inside my understanding of museums. I’ve been to museums many times when I was in China. I visited museums with my parents, and sometimes my peers. We read written labels’ discourse on the provenance of an object, such as a hand-made wooden chair from Ming dynasty, then we received a bunch of information in terms of how it was produced and how its social context was according to the introduction of docent. We experienced this process again and again in a short time period, then we finished our museum visit. The museums in my mind were shrines containing works of art, I was cautioned against touching objects in museums, photos were strictly forbidden to be taken even though the flash light was not open. I hardly noticed people working in museums behind the scene. Museums were once temples for me to worship the beauty of great human wisdom. They were isolated from what I experienced in my daily life. However, I know something in my mind may have already changed, I am not only a museum visitor but also a museum studies student, which means museums will possibly be my workplace. The dual identities that I embody makes me think more about what museums are, and what museums mean to me. With the external changes of technology and globalization, it is indispensable for a museum to make connections with the outside world and stop regarding itself as a “temple.” Museums need to restart life at a grass-roots level and make it popularized to the public. Integrating museums into the community and making people engage in museum activities needs to become a significant considerations for museum professionals. It is the responsibility of museum professionals to make museums connected.
A museum’s nature and characteristics facilitates the need to establish a interactive relationship between itself and the society. Museums, as explained by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), is an institution serving for education and aesthetic enjoyment. The Institute for Museum and Library Services (IMLS) also demonstrates that museums maneuver to organize its collection and design programs for “educational and aesthetic purposes”. The International Council of Museums straightforwardly points out that museums should be open to public and render service for society and the local community. These institutions address the educational role that museums play and intentionally highlight the interactive relationship between the society and museums. The belief that museums are holy places, storing precious artifacts, has been doubted by many scholars. John Cotton Dana, mentioned that an ideal museum should reach as much of the population as possible and be in proximity to the center of a city. The reason for the existence of museums is for the informal education of the public and as a service to society. Although the nature of a museum can be modified by humans and may change over time, the consensus or agreement that most of us have reached so far in terms of the role of a museum is that it should serve the public so that it can initiate potential at a maximum level.
Another reason for building a connection between museums and outside world is the internal demand of a museum. The organization, administration of museums, design of museum programs and the management of collections in museums all requires a network of external contractors, the engagement of those who can satisfy needs of the museum and help them reach public expectation. For example, in order to gain public trust and get an understanding of what direction museum programs can lead towards, more and more museums adopt the strategy of crowdsourcing. To encourage people to participate in the direction or guidance of museum projects, some museums use social medias such as online forums to connect with the public and understand the public need as much as possible. In terms of collection stewardship, museums have to integrate visitors’ experiences, personal interests, and museum resources into the consideration of the management and use of collections. Museums’ own operations and the purposes of serving public cannot be isolated from the society. Indeed, it is the reciprocal relationship built between museums and the public that help developing museums and meet the internal demands of a museum.
The philosophy that a museum should be open to public and building connections with society has led to a shift in the role of museum workers. As a future museum professional, I need to consider the role that I play in front of museum audiences. Not only should I become a collection manager, or exhibition planner, or museum educator, but more importantly I need to take the responsibility of acting as a facilitator between museums and the public. The mission that museums undertake for informal education and public memory always reminds me of my goal, which is to engage visitors in museums and make them feel freely exhibitions. Also, as a museum visitor who does not have many impressive experiences and happy memories, I do not want visitors to have miserable and frustrating memories when they stepped out from museums. I want them to be able to relate their museum experiences to their daily life, and make museum a social space for family and friends.
To make museums connected, what might be challenges or difficulties for museum experts and museum itself?
What I will eventually encounter in my career might be a realistic museum working environment instead of the romantic picture depicted in textbooks. Many factors have to be taken into consideration for museum professionals. One thing is that we need to be cautious that outside connection will not negatively intervene with the administration of museums. For example, individuals like philanthropists who donate their collections to the museums or fund museums may want to have more say in affairs of the museum and to be involved in decisions of the museum’s mission and scopes. Multiple personal goals or interests may also be involved in the museum’s connection with the public. The other challenge for museum programmers may be in keeping a balance between the freedom enjoyed by the public and the application of the museum’s resources including money and time. Engaging the public into the museum experiences also requires certain rules in order to avoid the waste of museum resources and make the work of museum effective.
In conclusion, it is a long way for museums to transform into a paradigm that everyone may agree on. But the goal of keeping a dynamic relationship with public and connecting with the society should always be a focus for museum experts.
Energy use and climate change: building and IT energy use, business air travel and carbon offsetting.
Our work on environmental issues improves operational efficiency and reduces utility and travel costs, enhances our credibility as advisors to clients, enables us to meet environmental requirements in client tender processes and supports employee engagement.
Our most significant environmental impact is the greenhouse gas emissions associated with our energy use and business air travel. We can reduce this in our operations and have a positive impact beyond our business by working with clients on these topics.
We have over 3,000 offices, and decisions regarding energy contracts and waste management are often made at local level, making it harder to implement a consistent approach. Most offices are leased properties and we need to work with hundreds of different landlords to achieve our goals.
As marketing becomes more data driven there is the potential for our carbon footprint associated with servers and data centres to grow.
Our strategy is set at Group level and implemented by our regional Environmental Action Teams with representatives from IT, real estate and procurement, in partnership with our companies. Progress is regularly reviewed by our Group finance director.
Our companies implement environmental management systems, of which a small percentage are certified to standards such as ISO 14001.
We issue annual performance reports and scorecards to over 200 senior decisionmakers in our businesses, enabling them to compare performance with others in the Group and to identify lower-performing offices. We conducted in-depth performance reviews with financial controllers from operating companies representing over 80% of emissions in 2015. We hold regular workshops to help facilities managers use energy and carbon data to reduce their footprint. Our environmental toolkit summarises WPP policies and provides case studies and information on best practices.
GRI indicators in this section: G4-14, G4-36, G4-EC2, G4-EN3, G4-EN4, G4-EN6, G4-EN7, G4-EN8, G4-EN15, G4-EN16, G4-EN17, G4-EN18, G4-EN19, G4-EN23, G4-EN27, G4-EN30, G4-EN33
By 2020, we aim to reduce carbon emissions to 1.8 tonnes of CO2e per employee, a 47% reduction from 2006. We use a carbon intensity target per employee, as headcount
is closely linked to levels of business activity and this allows us to reflect the impact of acquisitions and disposals without needing to adjust our baseline.
Our annual reduction target is 4% and each of our operating companies has its own individual reduction target.
Office energy use: Improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and IT systems. We estimate that 13% of our total floor space is now certified to advanced green building standards.
Air travel: Reducing non-essential flights by promoting videoconferencing and offsetting 100% of carbon emissions from our business air travel. Our videoconferencing network now incorporates over 700 units in 160 cities.
Renewable energy: Purchasing renewable electricity for our offices where available. Around 13% of the total electricity we purchase is generated from renewable sources.
We have identified the savings we need to achieve to reach our target by 2020 across all the priority areas of our strategy:
Our footprint per employee was 2.07 tonnes of CO2e, down 9% on 2014 and 39% lower than 2006. We hit our 4% annual reduction target and are on track for our 2020 target.
Our footprint per £million of revenue was 21.64 tonnes of CO2e, down 11% on 2014 and 53% lower than 2006.
Our absolute carbon footprint was also down on the previous year at 264,774 tonnes CO2e (2014: 281,389 tonnes CO2e).
We participate in the CDP Climate Change program, a collaboration of institutional investors encouraging companies to disclose climate change risks and opportunities. Their assessment showed we were the leading company in our sector for our climate change strategy and reporting with a score of 97B (2014: 98B). We also take part, as a responding company, in the CDP Supply Chain program.
In 2015, total energy use fell by 2% year-on-year and energy use per employee by 5%, largely due to investments in energy efficiency and office space consolidation. Total air travel increased by 5% year-on-year and air travel per employee by 1%, in line with revenue growth.
Since 2006, our total energy consumption increased by 15%. However, energy use per employee decreased by 29%. As a result, we have avoided £5.9 million in annual utility costs and 84,000 tonnes of CO2e. Total air miles increased by 41% since 2006, but air miles per employee decreased by 12%, avoiding over 83 million air miles and 33,000 tonnes of CO2e annually.
Our absolute carbon footprint in 2015 was 264,774 tonnes of CO2e (rating renewable electricity as zero emissions), a 6% decrease over 2014 compared with a 4% growth in headcount. If the renewable electricity we purchase globally is rated using the same emissions factors as standard grid electricity, our total carbon footprint in 2015 was 295,354 tonnes of CO2e.
Since 2006, our absolute carbon footprint has decreased by 2%, compared to a growth in reported headcount of 61% and revenue growth of 107%, demonstrating some success at decoupling emissions from business growth.
We aim to improve the energy performance of our buildings and use space more efficiently so we can reduce the amount of space we occupy, and therefore reduce the total amount of energy we consume.
When we lease, purchase, fit out or renovate a building larger than 50,000 square feet, we require it to be certified to an internationally-recognised green building standard. This includes the US standard LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) and the UK standard BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method).
Over 3.7 million square feet, 16% of our total floor space, is now certified to recognised standards (2014: 13%) against our target of 25%. Moves to certified buildings have reduced our energy use by an average of 21% at each location.
Offices below 50,000 square feet must either be certified to recognised green building standards or assessed against our own scorecard. This covers five criteria: energy and carbon; water; materials and waste; travel; and health & safety.
Detailed energy use data can help us improve efficiency and reduce energy use. When acquiring or retrofitting buildings, access to energy and other environmental data is one of the factors considered. We aim to integrate this into lease agreements with landlords and/or to install sub-metering.
Office space consolidation includes redesigning offices to use space more efficiently and encouraging flexible working to reduce the overall number of desks needed.
As part of a major transformation program to improve the efficiency of our IT infrastructure across WPP companies, we have signed a partnership with IBM. This will accelerate the move of our IT infrastructure into best-in-class external data centre services by the end of 2016. The contract was signed at the end of 2014 and includes energy and environmental targets to ensure we realise the potential carbon reduction opportunities from improving IT efficiency.
Our managed print program will cut energy, paper and cartridges used at each location by up to 40%. We aim to have up to 80% of our global printing fleet under management by the end of 2016.
Sea Containers, the new London headquarters for Ogilvy and MEC, is a state-of-the-art development with a lower carbon footprint designed to help our companies attract the best talent in the industry.
The longest commercial frontage on the River Thames and one of our 10 largest locations, Sea Containers provides 230,000 square feet of space over 11 floors. The interior, designed by BDG architecture + design, a WPP company, makes use of a diverse range of spaces to accommodate all types of working styles from open to private, formal to normal, small to large, bookable to non-bookable. There are no traditional ‘cellular’ offices. The site accommodates 2,300 people at only 1,700 traditional workstations, with Ogilvy and MEC encouraging use of flexible working options for their people.
Sea Containers is certified to green building standard BREEAM Excellent, and sustainability features include use of LED lighting throughout (over 1,700 fixtures). This will reduce electricity consumption by 31% compared with traditional fluorescent office lighting and reduce maintenance costs.
We aim to increase our use of electricity generated from renewable sources, including green-tariff electricity contracts, to 25% of total supply by 2020, achieving 21% in 2015. Our use of renewable electricity reduces our carbon footprint by 30,580 tonnes of CO2e.
We reviewed green-tariff uptake at our 100 largest locations and found that, in many locations, suitable contracts aren’t available or electricity purchasing is controlled by the landlord. As an alternative, and to help us reach our target of 25% renewable energy, we have begun to purchase renewable energy certificates (RECs) in the US. Each REC purchased is equivalent to purchasing 1MWh of renewable energy and promotes investment in renewable energy generation. We purchased 14,422 Green-e Energy certified RECs for 2015, working with Renewable Choice Energy, a US-based business providing clean energy products and services.
Our companies work closely with clients and rely on face-to-face meetings to build relationships and deliver on projects. But while we cannot eliminate air travel, we can reduce unnecessary flights and use audio and videoconferencing as a replacement for some face-to-face meetings.
We have invested in a videoconferencing network that now incorporates over 700 units in 160 cities worldwide. 43 additional units were added in 2015 and usage increased by 6% on the previous year. Our 24-hour, five-day-a-week helpdesk supports our people to use the service effectively. We are integrating this service into other online collaboration platforms, enabling us to extend video services to all users within the Group.
We offset 100% of our air travel emissions by purchasing high-quality carbon credits. We work with South Pole Group, a company that develops emission-reduction projects. In 2015, we invested £150,000 to support four renewable energy-generation projects in faster-growing economies. Together these projects generate over 200m kWh of renewable electricity a year and support almost 600 direct jobs. Our operating companies cover the cost of the carbon credits, based on their air travel mileage, which encourages initiatives to reduce air travel.
Since 2007, we have purchased and permanently retired over 1.1 million carbon credits and supported 15 projects. We focus on projects that provide both environmental benefits and support local socio-economic development, above for our current projects.

Gold Standard – Established in 2003 and endorsed by over 80 NGOs. Used in voluntary and CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) projects. Aims to ensure that projects are both reducing emissions and providing sustainable benefits to local populations.
Social Carbon – Created in 2008 by the Ecologica Institute in Brazil. Assesses the social, environmental and economic performance of projects. Works in conjunction with carbon accounting standards that measure emissions reductions, such as VCS.
Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) – Launched in 2006 and the most widely-used carbon accounting standard for the voluntary carbon offsetting market. Ensures that emissions reductions meet accepted quality standards and are independently verified, uniquely numbered and transparently listed in a central database.
As well as managing our direct greenhouse gas emissions, we can also have an influence on indirect emissions associated with our business activities – our value chain emissions.
We analysed these emissions in 2014 to identify opportunities for WPP to work with clients and suppliers to reduce emissions connected with client media plans and other parts of our supply chain.
Our analysis of our value chain footprint is based on data from our UK business, WPP’s home country and second-largest market. It shows a value chain footprint in the UK of 1.2 million tonnes of CO2e. Our main sources of emissions are:
Advertising we place for clients – emissions from the physical dissemination of advertising through press, TV, radio, internet and outdoor channels. See chart above.
Goods and services we buy – emissions associated with the goods and services we buy from suppliers to create marketing campaigns for clients and to run our business. For example, emissions from travel to an advertising shoot or emissions associated with manufacturing the ICT equipment used in our offices.
Day-to-day activities (direct emissions) – emissions associated with running our business including office energy use, business air travel, employee commuting and waste. With the exception of employee commuting, these emissions are covered by our current carbon strategy and target.
We are developing a carbon metric for GroupM, our media investment management business, to use in its media plans, and exploring how we can work with clients to reduce the carbon footprint of media campaigns. We are also using the analysis to help procurement teams consider carbon impacts. This will include adding a carbon dashboard to our procurement spend analytics system that will identify more carbon-intensive suppliers and categories of spend.
Emissions from the manufacturing and printing of paper used for newspaper and billboards advertisements.
Emissions from the energy used to transmit TV and radio advertisements, to transfer advertisement data over the internet, and to deliver newspaper and billboard advertisements.
Emissions from the energy used to view and/or listen to the advertisement on a TV/radio, smartphone, tablet or computer.
This data covers the year ended 31 December 2015 in line with the Group’s financial reporting period.
Our carbon emissions statement 2015 has been prepared in accordance with the World Resource Institute (WRI) and World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition (the GHG Protocol).
All greenhouse gases emissions figures are in metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e). They include three of the six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol – carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) emissions have been omitted from our reporting as they are not a material source of greenhouse gases for WPP.
Emissions data is included for all operations for which WPP and its subsidiaries have operational control. This covers 128,000 employees. Associate companies are excluded.
All purchased electricity, including electricity purchased at grid average carbon intensity and renewable electricity purchased under specific contractual instruments, such as green-tariff contracts with suppliers and energy attribute certificates (e.g. renewable energy certificates in the US or guarantees of origin in the EU).
An estimate for other scope 3 emissions that we do not currently measure on a global basis, including emissions from leased cars, taxis and couriers. This estimate is an additional 15% that we add to our carbon footprint and is shown under ‘other estimated scope 3 emissions’.
CO2e emissions have been calculated on the basis of measured or estimated energy use, fuel use and miles travelled, multiplied by the relevant carbon emission factors. In 2014, we updated our emissions factors for scope 2 and scope 3 emissions, and our data is based on the following emissions factors:
For the UK: UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (2015)
(business air travel) UK Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra), GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (2015).
When calculating our carbon footprint, we rate purchased renewable electricity as zero emissions to account for WPP’s use of renewable electricity. We follow the market-based method of the revised version of the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. For full transparency, we also disclose total electricity purchased at grid average carbon intensity according to the location-based method of the Guidance mentioned above. In our 2014 reporting, we trialled the use of local and sub-national emission factors to calculate emissions from electricity use in several countries, including Australia and the US. Following a review of these emission factors in 2015, we decided to revert back to country-level emission factors to ensure consistency and comparability over the years. We also identified a number of business units which misstated their greenhouse gas emissions in 2014. As a consequence, we restated our 2014 Scope 2 emissions. This restatement is reflected in the tables above and throughout this report.
Data used to calculate CO2e emissions is collected quarterly through WPP’s financial reporting system, and includes some estimated data (e.g. in some locations electricity usage is estimated based on headcount or floor space). In 2015, our data covered 96% of our operations by employee headcount. The remaining 4% was extrapolated based on the Group’s total headcount at year-end.
Our carbon data is reviewed by Bureau Veritas, an independent assurance provider. Following its review of our 2014 data, Bureau Veritas made a number of recommendations for improving our approach. We have implemented many of these in our 2015 reporting process. This includes enhancements to our sustainability data collection system to facilitate the ease and accuracy of data submission for our companies. See the Independent Verification Statement.
We aim to use resources efficiently, reduce waste and reuse and recycle where possible. Many procurement and waste management decisions are made at operating company level and we encourage our companies to use preferred suppliers selected by WPP who offer products and services with improved environmental credentials.
As an office-based business, paper use is one of our most significant resource impacts. Previously we have focused on increasing recycled content in our paper used for printing and copying.
In 2015, we took a broader approach to sustainable paper sourcing, looking not just at paper with recycled content but also paper sourced from sustainably-managed forests. We have updated our target and now aim to reach 80% sustainably-sourced paper by 2020. This includes paper with recycled content and paper certified to recognised sustainability standards such as FSC and PEFC. We reached 31% in 2015.
During 2016, we will be working with our largest paper users, including companies purchasing paper on behalf of clients, to implement our new approach.
Our total paper usage in 2015 was 4,897 tonnes (2014: 5,101 tonnes). Our managed print program (see IT energy use) helps us to reduce paper use by up to 40% per location.
Water scarcity is a major challenge in some regions of the world. While we do not use large volumes of water in our business we do aim to use water carefully.
We ran a pilot project (2010-2014) to measure and reduce water use in our 11 largest locations in areas of water scarcity (which account for around 20% of our floor space in these areas). This focused on: identifying and repairing leaks; upgrading water fixtures and fittings during renovations; and reusing rainwater and wastewater where feasible. We reduced water use per person at these locations by 21%, exceeding our 20% target. We are sharing what we have learned by providing guidance for our offices, available on our intranet, and by integrating water conservation into our property acquisition and refurbishment process (see Building energy).
Using the data from our pilot and external benchmarks we have estimated our total water use at 1.9 million cubic metres, equivalent to 14.8 cubic metres per employee per year.
Our main types of waste are electronic waste and office consumables such as paper, card, cans, plastic bottles and toner cartridges. We look for opportunities to reduce waste and increase recycling, working with landlords in our leased properties. To make it easier for our operating companies to recycle their waste we have identified preferred suppliers of recycling services for paper, standard office consumables and mobile phones in all major markets.
We are working to improve our data collection on waste and recycling but have further to go to improve data quality. In 2015, we estimate the Group generated 8,772 tonnes of waste of which 65% was recycled. The remaining 35% was disposed via landfill or incineration.
We recycled 5,713 tonnes of waste in 2015 (2014: 5,416 tonnes), of which 71% was paper and cardboard.
Management of electronic waste is a particular priority for WPP. Our policy is that obsolete IT equipment should be refurbished and sold for reuse, or if this is not possible, be broken down for recycling. Disposal is a last resort, and must be done in compliance with local environmental regulations and data security best practice. As part of our IT transformation program, IBM our main contractor is working to increase reuse and safe recycling of old IT equipment.

I think it’s so important kids learn where their food comes from, and have a sense of fun learning how to get their own food. My kids love fishing, and we wanted to organize a fishing trip with my family and friends above. We went down to the wonderfully named Beer on the South Devon Coast, and boarded the Good Ship Lillie May with chipper skipper Paul showing us how to catch the plentiful mackerel.
He mentioned that it was good fishing recently, and we came away with a great haul, the kids really loved it. I wanted to make sure the most was made of this treasure of the sea. For a lot of people mackerel is quite a strong flavoured fish, but I’ve found the fresher it is, the better and subtler the flavour, so I kept the fish on ice. I also had 3 ways that I wanted to use the fish.
So within half an hour of landing the fish, we set up for a picnic on the cliffs. I’d thought ahead and bought along sushi rice, wasabi and soy sauce. I cleaned up a couple of the spanking fresh fish, filleted, and sliced. Placing the slices on blocks of sushi with a little wasabi…..wow, the freshest sushi possible, the fish tasted so good. The kids really loved this too.
I then set up the BBQ, and popped a load of the mackerel onto the oiled grill to stop them sticking, serious searing heat to crisp up the skin, and a squeeze of lemon, a few minutes a side, simple perfection.
The remaining mackerel were kept in a cool box on ice, taken home and gutted, before curing ready for hot smoked mackerel, I used a 50/50 brown sugar/coarse sea salt dry cure, and cured the fish overnight, before hot smoking in the bradley smoker using oak, for around an hour at 80 degC. I’d say they were pretty happy with the results?
Fantastic – I can remember going fishing on a boat from St. Ives, when I was very small in the 1960s. Bringing up my line with 6 mackerel on it was unbelievable! I wish we’d eaten sashimi in Britain back then 😉
I was amazed how good it was 🙂 I love st Ives, hopefully I’m giving my kids similar memories to yours.

"There is something quietly civilizing about sharing a meal with other people. The simple act of making someone something to eat, even a bowl of soup or a loaf of bread, has a many-layered meaning. It suggests an act of protection and caring, of generosity and intimacy. It is in itself a sign of respect." Nigel Slater

Information on interesting international attractions and places to visit. Make your travel plans here without all the hype and sales pitches!
Let’s face it, travel isn’t always going to be sightseeing, touring historical places or other activities. Getting to your destination can be fun and seeing all the wonderful sights along the way and while you are there is what travel is about, but there will be those times when you have nothing to do.
I like to read. A good book or story can help relax me and gives me something to do when there is nothing to do.
When experiencing “jet lag”. You know, that time after the flight when your body has no clue what time it really is even though you eyes and brain know that it is night and you should be asleep?
I’m sure there are other times that reading would be enjoyable while traveling. In fact, you don’t have to travel to enjoy a good book. Just relax at home and read.

Bell County was created from Milam County in 1850, just five years after Texas entered the Union. County Commissioners chose a county seat on the banks of Nolan Creek and named it Nolandsville. Two years later, January 12, 1852, the town’s name became Belton and it was incorporated. Bell is named for Peter Hansborough Bell, the third governor of Texas.
The government of Bell County, Texas exists to promote and sustain a superior quality of life in Central Texas.
Located deep in the heart of Texas, Belton is a unique city with friendly people and a rich history.

Halloween (a shortening of All Hallows’ Evening), also known as Hallowe'en or All Hallows' Eve, is a yearly holiday observed around the world on 31 October, the night before All Saints' Day. Typical festive Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (also known as "guising"), attending costume parties, carving jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing, visiting haunted attractions, playing pranks, telling scary stories, and watching horror films, as well as the religious observances of praying, fasting and attending vigils or church services.
All Saints' Day, also known as All Hallows, Solemnity of All Saints, or Feast of All Saints) is a solemnity celebrated on 1 November by the Catholic Church and several Protestant denominations, and on the first Sunday after Pentecost in Eastern Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy, in honour of all the saints, known and unknown. The liturgical celebration begins at Vespers on the evening of 31 October and ends at the close of 1 November. It is thus the day before All Souls' Day.
Hallowmas is another term for the feast, and was used by Shakespeare in this sense. However, a few recent writers have applied this term to the three days from 31 October to 2 November inclusive, as a synonym for the triduum of Hallowtide.
All Souls' Day is a day of prayer for the dead, particularly but not exclusively one's relatives. In Western Christianity the annual celebration is now held on 2 November and is associated with All Saints' Day (1 November) and its vigil, Hallowe'en (31 October). In the liturgical books of the western Catholic Church (the Latin Church) it is called The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed, and is celebrated annually on 2 November, even if this date falls on a Sunday. In Anglicanism it is called Commemoration of All Faithful Departed and is an optional celebration. In the Eastern Orthodox Church and the associated Eastern Catholic Churches, it is celebrated several times during the year and is not associated with the month of November.
Beliefs and practices associated with All Souls' Day vary widely among Christian churches and denominations.
In the USA, Veterans Day annually falls on November 11. This day is the anniversary of the signing of the armistice, which ended the World War I hostilities between the Allied nations and Germany in 1918. Veterans are thanked for their services to the United States on Veterans Day.
Veterans Day is intended to honor and thank all military personnel who served the United States in all wars, particularly living veterans. It is marked by parades and church services and in many places the American flag is hung at half mast. A period of silence lasting two minutes may be held at 11am. Some schools are closed on Veterans Day, while others do not close, but choose to mark the occasion with special assemblies or other activities.
What's that in the back of the refrigerator!? I don't want to find out. Don't open it...... the odor may overwhelm you!!! Hold your breath, scrunch your nose if you must, and get to the task.
Everything in your refrigerator was once a fresh, healthy food, ready for your consumption. It may have been a tasty leftover, intended for later enjoyment. Unfortunately, over the course of weeks or more, things get pushed to the back of the refrigerator and slowly transform into something impossible to identify.
We've all run across items in the refrigerator that once were tasty food, But, now, they are some dried out, mold covered nasty, that you remove and dispose of at arms length.
Use this day to clean out your refrigerator, top to bottom. When it comes to food safety, we fall back to the old saying " When in doubt, throw it out!"
This is an annual international event celebrated on 19 November. Inaugurated in 1992 on 7 February by Prof Thomas Oaster, the project was re-initialised in 1999 in Trinidad and Tobago. The longest running celebration of International men's day is Malta, where events have occurred since 7 February 1994.
International Men's Day finds support from a variety of individuals and groups in Australia, the Caribbean, North America, Asia, Europe and Africa. Speaking on behalf of UNESCO, Director of Women and Culture of Peace Ingeborg Breines said of IMD, "This is an excellent idea and would give some gender balance." She added that UNESCO was looking forward to cooperating with the organizers.
The objectives of celebrating an International Men's Day include focusing on men's and boys' health, improving gender relations, promoting gender equality, and highlighting positive male role models. It is an occasion to highlight discrimination against men and boys and to celebrate their achievements and contributions, in particular for their contributions to community, family, marriage, and child care. The broader and ultimate aim of the event is to promote basic humanitarian values.

St. Andrew's Day (Scots: Saunt Andra's Day, Scottish Gaelic: Là Naomh Aindrea) is Scotland's official national day. In 2006, the Scottish Parliament designated St Andrew's Day as an official bank holiday. It is also a national holiday in Romania.
In Germany, the feast day is celebrated as Andreasnacht ("(St.) Andrew's Night"), in Austria with the custom of Andreasgebet ("(St.) Andrew's Prayer"), and in Poland as Andrzejki ("Andrew's (festivities)"), in Russia as Андреева ночь ("Andrew's night").

Result: Stirling won by 15 runs. By Ben Goldfinch Aldgate confront a challenging run toward the 2016-17 Hills Cricket Association A-grade finals series following a strong display against Kangarilla last Saturday at Yaroona. The Gaters currently reside in third position on the HCA ladder, with four victories from nine matches. In the run home Aldgate will confront Meadows after the Meyer Shield carnival, followed by important matches against Uraidla and Mt Lofty, before having a bye in the final round. It appears Aldgate will require at least two victories to secure a coveted finals berth – its first since 2011-12 when it was dismissed for just 19 against Meadows in a semifinal. Aldgate sent Kangarilla into bat first in last Saturday’s Round 10 meeting. Kangarilla were reasonably positioned on 3/58 at the drinks break and Chris Thorpe (39) appeared the key batsmen. The Gaters turned to teenage leg spinner Will Quigley-Smith who was making his debut. Quigley-Smith attends St Peters College and has spent time playing in Under 16 ranks with Kensington. He dismissed Thorpe after drinks and Kangarilla eventually made 102, before being dismissed in the 38th over. Aaron Dent (20) and Jono Makai (20) were other batsmen to get amongst the runs for the Blues. Tall fast bowler Ollie Rushforth collected 4/5 from seven overs, three being caught behind by wicket-keeper Mitchell Thomas. Rushforth has progressed through Aldgate’s junior ranks into senior grade, along with Frank Clements, who picked up 2/11 from his eight overs. Leg spinner Dale Stephens chipped in with 2/29 and has collected 14 wickets for the season to date. Aldgate commenced its run chase on the front foot with 43 runs from 10 overs with Josh Callaghan (20) and skipper Kaylem Short on top. The Gaters lost their way and reached 5/75, before Matthew Yuen (13) and Short (87) steered the visitors past the required total with a 70-run partnership. Aldgate surpassed the required total in the 32nd over and eventually made 9/164. Short struck six boundaries and three sixes en route to his highest score for Aldgate. Englishman Short signed with Aldgate for the 2015/16 campaign and is a teacher at Mt Barker South Primary School. Leading wicket-takers for Kangarilla included David Golder (3/41), Troy Martinsen (3/12) and Travis Kemp (2/36). Valley climb Happy Valley have risen into fourth position following consecutive victories against Stirling and last Saturday against Mt Lofty. Last Saturday’s contest at Heathfield Community Oval was a nail biter. It came down to the final over, with Happy Valley requiring three runs as Mt Lofty fast bowler James Kittel-Neill steamed in. During the last over Jamie Moran was adjudged leg before with the first delivery, before Alistair Bowes and Todd Margitich pushed singles. Margitich was run out, which resulted in a frantic final ball with Rik Wildman on strike. Wildman struck two runs from the final ball, handing Happy Valley victory and fourth spot. Happy Valley completed its innings at 9/154, after Mt Lofty had made 4/152 earlier in the afternoon. “We have had good wins against Stirling and Mt Lofty and it’s great to carry momentum into 2017,” outlined Happy Valley president Margitich. Mt Lofty were sent into bat first and Nick Justice carried his bat for 68 from 114 balls faced. Justice hit five boundaries and two sixes. Leith Dawes came in with 15 overs remaining and made 46 from 48 deliveries, which included five boundaries. Justin Browne was the pick of the Valley Vikings bowlers with a restrictive 1/13 from five overs, while Jake Turnbull collected 3/21 from eight overs. Happy Valley batted solidly down the order. Five of the opening six Happy Valley batsmen reached double figures, with Samuel Neville (30) and Turnbull (27) the leading pair. Meadows in charge Scott Creek Ironbank and Meadows locked horns in the top-of-the-table battle at Meadows Oval last Saturday. SCIB entered the contest with four wins on the trot and defending premier Meadows were eager for the challenge. It was a good game of cricket and SCIB won the toss and elected to bat first. SCIB were under the pump early with inform Adam Shearwood trapped by Angus Frazer, whilst Jack Turner and Josh Rosman were run out with direct hits. Regular wickets then fell and SCIB were disastrously positioned at 7/33. Daniel Desengo and Andy Adams (51) teamed up for a settling 26-run partnership. Andy Adams (51) hung around and was joined by Ben McGowan (34) for an important 44-run partnership. SCIB eventually made 111 runs, before being dismissed in the 37th over. SCIB’s innings progressed along from 4/20 after 10 overs, 7/47 after 20 overs and 8/89 after 30 overs, before closing out proceedings. Meadows were disappointed with letting SCIB slightly off the hook, but restricting the top side to 111 was an impressive performance. Athletic quick Frazer was highly restrictive claiming 2/8 from five overs, including five maidens, whilst youngsters Nick Jaensch (3/40) and Max Buckley (2/27) offered good support. Meadows began the chase with reliable opening batsmen Haydn Reid (49) and Brad Dawe (63). Once again the duo produced the goods with 64 runs for the first wicket. “Once Haydn and Brad get set they are hard to get out and I think they are enjoying the 40-over format,” commented Meadows captain Rohan Reid. “The left and right combination is working well at the top of the order.” The opening wicket partnership lasted 16 overs before H. Reid was dismissed by Ben Thomas. Pressing for quick runs, Meadows motored along to 7/201 from 40 overs, losing wickets late in the innings. “It’s likely we will play SCIB again in the final and look forward to that if it happens,” commented skipper Reid. The Bulldogs innings progressed along from 0/49 after 10 overs, 1/77 after 20 overs, 3/123 after 30 overs, before eventually making 7/201. Gaters chase finals dream Eagles home Stirling picked up its third scalp for the 2016-17 A-grade campaign against Uraidla last Saturday at Stirling Oval. Uraidla won the toss and elected to bat first, posting 5/161 from 40 overs, with skipper Alex Heptinstall (42) and Aaron Carter (37) contributing 78 for the second wicket. Heptinstall struck five boundaries, whilst Carter hit three boundaries and two sixes. Alexander Kern (27 not out) and Renzo Gaetan (32) also got into the action, with Gaetan striking one boundary and three sixes. Gaetan and Kern came together with Uraidla 4/108 and assisted the visitors toward 5/161. It appeared a competitive score on paper, however, Stirling were determined to reel in the required total, and reached the tally having lost seven wickets. Daniel Gonzales and Ben Zampa opened the batting with a 34-run opening wicket stand. Zampa top scored with 47 from 65 deliveries faced. Uraidla had its chances throughout Stirling’s innings, but couldn’t collect wickets. Uraidla used nine bowlers with Gaetan the best with 3/29. Jacob Gonzales (24), Peter Fryer (31), skipper Jack Pick (12) and Julian Zytnik (12) got scores on the board for the Eagles. Stirling reeled in the required tally with a few overs remaining. It was a missed opportunity for Uraidla, which were striving to keep its top four aspirations alive. “It was a game we should have won,” commented Uraidla skipper Heptinstall, who has been selected in the Hills Meyer Shield squad. “There was plenty riding on the line, but we couldn’t get the job done unfortunately. “We couldn’t get the wickets when it was required.” Mt Lofty opening batsman Nick Justice prepares to pull a delivery square of the wicket during his undefeated contribution of 68 runs as Happy Valley skipper and slips fielder Jake Turnbull watches on during last Saturday’s Round 10 Hills Cricket Association A-grade match at Heathfield Oval. Right: Uraidla’s Aaron Carter displays an unorthodox style as he attempts a leg side glance in his knock of 37 runs against Hills A-grade cricket opponent Stirling last Saturday. Stirling won its third match of the 2016-17 campaign after defeating the Demons by 15 runs.
Nobody understands the science of building better than . If you want to create a thermally efficient and air tight space, it's not enough just to insulate. You must choose the right insulation and air sealing system for the application, and be sure it's properly installed.
In this application, considered the most effective, by most of the SPF industry, the foam is sprayed directly to the underside of the roof between the joists, down around the rim and into the soffit areas, on the gable wall ends, and effectively sealing off and insulating the entire attic space from any air infiltration.
By now you have probably heard of this procedure with terms like: "Hot Roof design", Unvented Attic, Conditioned Attic, or "The Insulated Envelope."
A vented attic situation will become approximately 130-140 degrees in the summer. There's no reason for your air-conditioning and vent-ductwork to have to work in that type of severe conditions. There is also opportunity for moisture to form due to condensation on these appliances
By applying spray foam directly to the underside of the roof deck, it now insulates the attic space from the extreme heat that once radiated thorough the hot shingles sheathing and roof. The severe temperatures no longer exist in the attic. In short, the attic now becomes a passively "conditioned" space of the house that is just as comfortable as any other room in the home.
A roof system insulated with spray foam reduces energy several ways. Energy loss from ducts located in the attic is essentially eliminated. The top of the building is much tighter resulting in less infiltration and exfiltration, so excess moisture isn't pulled into the attic. Infiltration through the ceiling is also reduced. In addition, the attic temperature is remarkably lower, which further reduces energy loads.
In a standard insulation system, ceiling insulation reduces the transfer of heat from the attic to the living space (in the summer). Attic temperatures can often approach 140 degrees or more during the day. Most of this heat enters the attic space through a multi-step process.
First, solar energy warms the shingles and sheathing. The hot sheathing then transfers heat to the rest of the attic through conduction, convection and radiant heat transfer. The 140 degree temperature of the underside roof surface drives the heat transfer process that pulls air in from all the openings in a house. And that cost you a lot of money.
Standard HomeVented attic graphic showing the natural convection process that allows air to be 'pulled' up through the house and escaping outside.
By having insulate the roof surface with spray foam, the surface temperature exposed to the attic (the temperature driving the heat transfer) is reduced by as much as 40 degrees.
Both conduction and convection heat transfer are proportional to a temperature difference, so that heat transfer will be reduced proportional to the drop in surface temperature.
Sealing the attic is the single most cost-effective solution for lower energy bills and a comfortable home.

If you want to build a thermally efficient and air tight home, it's not enough just to insulate. You must choose the right insulation and air sealing system for the application, and be sure it's properly installed.
Did you know that an improperly insulated and sealed home delivers 4500 lbs. of excess greenhouse gases into the air each year? It can also waste 20 percent or more of the energy used to heat and cool the home.
Our Building Science experts understand the principles of heat, air and moisture flow, and how the building envelope interacts with a building's mechanical systems as well as its occupants.
N.A.S.A. applied one-inch of spray-on foam insulation on the Space Shuttle's External Tank that serves to insulate the tank. The closed-cell foam used on the tank was developed to keep the Shuttle's liquid hydrogen fuel at minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit and the liquid oxygen tank at near minus 297 degrees Fahrenheit even as the tank sits under the hot Florida sun while preventing a buildup of ice on the outside of the tank.

It is now well established and accepted by most architects and builders that controlling air infiltration is the best and most cost-effective means of reducing wasteful heat loss and providing a comfortable indoor environment.
Most architects tend to design structures that are tight and energy efficient by incorporating the latest in proven, energy saving construction details into their drawings.
We have found that since there is no performance specification to dictate building construction, there is no guarantee when it comes to building performance. Regardless of the contractor's ability, tight buildings are not created from a list of materials and drawings in the absence of specifications that dictate the building's designed environmental performance.
To improve building performance, our company focuses on the basic building science principle that air infiltration compromises the effectiveness of the building envelope. Our approach is incremental - areas of infiltration are diagnosed and fixed in order of magnitude. This provides the most thorough and cost-effective solution possible.
has satisfied clients. Our clients have been extremely pleased as they benefit from cost-savings and an immediate improvement in comfort.
We operate two-part urethane injection equipment to superinsulate new and old buildings. Included in this equipment are special nozzles and guns to seal cracks and small openings which effectively stops infiltration that cause poor thermal performance.
There are other urethane contractors who provide typical spray foam services; however, very few go beyond the installation of conventional spray-roofing and spray-wall insulation processes.
Our capabilities, while serving these common markets in some cases, are specially designed to meet the unconventional needs of specialty markets.
By employing standard and custom equipment which processes foam through both spray and injection techniques, we can utilize numerous chemical systems with varying densities, speeds, closed-cell content, fire rating, vapor permeability, and other desirable environmental characteristics.
While there may be other foam contractors who provide spray and injection services, to the best of our knowledge, we are the only company that currently uses "ratio monitoring" equipment in the field for this process. Ratio monitoring enables our technicians to maintain the exact chemical formulation (mix) for the duration of the installation process.
It is impossible to guarantee that the appropriate mix is being maintained without the use of this equipment.
The highest quality products and with many small details that often go unnoticed by other contractors, let's take your insulation project to the next level.

Nonstop communication - The key to the success of your project is good communication. And, a big part of communication is listening. From the beginning of a project to its end, our company places a high priority on listening - to you, your needs and wishes.
Solid Science - Our Building Science experts understand the principles of heat, air and moisture flow, and how the building envelope interacts with a building's mechanical systems as well as its occupants.
Thank you for your professionalism and timely completion of the job. It was a pleasure to work with the insulation team.
This contractor started the job on schedule and completed on schedule. Jobsite was cleaned up well. Work was well done and extra effort was applied. My Eichler house had special needs, such as a flat roof with skylights. The foam was placed to improve water drainage.
We have a 7,000 ft commercial building that we have had to deal with roof leaks every year, trying to patch leaks all over through the years. We had the foam applied four years ago and have not had one leak and our air conditioning cost have dropped massively.
It was pleasure for me to work with during the last two months. I am completely satisfied with conversation we had today about couple small things to do to finish the job. I believe that my client is very happy with job you've done for his house. I will be glad to see you again on my future projects.
Your guys were great when they came out; very professional, and cleaned up really well afterward. If you need me to pass this on to someone else, let me know. I know in today's world, we only hear about things when people are unhappy or complaining about something, so we wanted to make sure we told you it was a pleasure to do business with .
Thank you so much for all of your help. As you recall, I had built my home in 2009. It's a 7000 sf home and even after installing spray foam with another company, my electric bill still peaked at over $1100 per month. When you came to inspect, I was impressed with your advice and recommendations to remediate the other contractors shady work. It has now been a full year since you performed your work and I am very pleased to say, our highest utility bill we now see is $600 per month and that includes a new in-ground pool. Your crew was fantastic and your work has clearly exceeded our expectations. We will help you get more work anyway we can
The spray foam insulation that did for me was a pro job all the way. From the clear options to the discussions, we are blown away. You were on time, job looks fantastic and the cleanup, all were perfect. I guess it helps to have owner onsite! I highly recommend !
I wanted to say thank you so much for helping with my home. Your crew was very polite, professional and respectful of my home from start to finish.
I wanted to let you know how pleased we are with the job you guys did for me. The foam looks great on my basement walls. The boiler hardly runs and the basement is very comfortable. I have recommended you to many of my friends and family in the area with similar issues - Good luck and thanks again.
Great job on my home! I couldn't be more pleased with what you did for us. I am a very picky customer and you exceeded our expectations. Good luck moving forward.

The Lasik operation can be a terrific, life-altering alternative for lots of people whose vision is less than best. There are several different kinds of Lasik operations now readily available, from the original and well recorded procedure to Lasik treatments made with 3 dimensional wavefronts, or done totally with lasers. Each of these variations of the Lasik procedure ought to be gone over with the physician that is to perform the operation.
In some cases reading the scary stories of the outcomes of a Lasik procedure can deter people from seriously thinking about such a option. It is also real that the large numbers of individuals who have a effective, trouble-free Lasik surgery tend not to report a comprehensive and long story of their experience, unlike those that have experienced difficulty afterward.
However, it readies to understand exactly what the possible side effects of the Lasik treatment are, and also the likelihood that a person of these side effects will take place for a particular client. Similar to any medicine we take, each has a possible number of side effects, but we usually presume that the likelihood of a major adverse effects is little, and we take the medication anyway. This short article will hopefully put issues of the prospective Lasik client into point of view so that they can calmly and attentively consider having a Lasik treatment done in the future.
More than one million Lasik procedures are carried out in the US every year, inning accordance with the FDA. This arm of the national government has actually accumulated the following statistics for the most typical adverse effects of the Lasik treatment. These data will likewise differ by the physician performing the surgical treatment, so ensure to obtain as much info on the potential Lasik physician as possible.
After Lasik surgery, 1.7 percent of patients experience some glare or level of sensitivity to light after the operation. This varies by client, however this additional hints level of sensitivity is especially noticeable when taking a look at a brilliant light, such as a streetlight when strolling in the evening, or other strong light and dark contrast. Another light associated negative effects is a halo around a light, and this happens in 3.5 percent of Lasik patients.
The brand-new, remedied vision can be seen rapidly by some Lasik patients, in as low as a few hours after surgical treatment. A lot of patients that have undergone the Lasik procedure discover the Visit Website change is irreversible within a couple of days. In 2.6 percent of clients that have actually had a Lasik treatment done, there is consistent visual change within at least a part of their sphere of vision.
Finally, some clients do not get a completely corrected sphere of vision after their Lasik treatment. This occurs with a small number of clients, and the FDA stats are that just 3 percent of clients have this effect. In all or nearly all cases, the doctor in charge will perform an extra Lasik treatment to enhance this.
This detailing of the major permanent side effects of the Lasik treatment need to put any personal horror stories into perspective. Notice that none of the portions are above 3 percent, and this must bring comfort to most potential Lasik clients. It must also motivate them to look carefully at the Lasik physician's personal record.
There are numerous different types of Lasik operations now readily available, from the initial and well documented treatment to Lasik treatments done with three dimensional wavefronts, or done completely with lasers.

Tuesday and Thursday are my "dissertation days." They have been for quite a while now, and I look forward to having regular, dedicated time to write up my thoughts and researches on three wild and wooly saints of the early medieval period in Wales, Ireland, and Anglo-Saxon England. I sat down this morning with great hopes of giving the chapter on Cuthbert a thorough once-over for grammar, flow, and accurate footnotes before sending it off to my faculty supervisors. It was, however, not to be. Writing two days a week in discrete blocks like this has left me with a very choppy manuscript. After a while it became clear that this chapter would not be heading anywhere for at least another week.
Sigh. I had so hoped.... Realizing that this relieved some of my self-induced stress, however, allowed me to look out the window with new eyes. A surprise snowfall yesterday had left many of us in New Hampshire worried that Spring had abandoned us far too soon. But today most of the snow and ice was already gone, and the outdoors was beckoning.
The temperature finally got up over freezing this past weekend -- warm enough to open the windows and declare a Spring Cleaning day. I did the three bathrooms and the three upstairs rooms. My husband cleaned out the fireplace, the porch where we stack the firewood in the winter and enjoy the sound of the nearby stream in the summer, and scrubbed out the kitchen. Oh, bliss!
The day before, I had just heard the news that an old friend had been elected a bishop in the Episcopal Church. Evidently the election process was a bit messy, but looking at the ballots posted on the internet, it seemed as though the newly-elected bishop had in fact been the frontrunner all along. And it got me to wondering, how do we 'clean up' in God's household? It was a day's work for my husband and me to get our little house sparkling and fresh. Now my friend has been called to be the head-of-household for over 100 congregations. How does that get done?
It was a tough weekend. I left work early on Friday with a very queasy stomach. Had to miss a meeting with my supervisor to get trained on some new software that I need to know within the next two weeks. But it just wasn't worth staying there to learn it. After spending the rest of Friday enjoying saltines and ginger ale, I was starting to feel like myself a bit on Saturday.
There was some laundry waiting to be done, so on Saturday afternoon I put the first load in. Midway through the second load I heard a strange noise, and looked over to see water gushing out from under the washing machine onto the carpet in the next room. Stop the machine! The water kept gushing! Turn off the valves! Mop up the carpet! Pull out the soaking wet clothes and get them on a rack in the upstairs bath tub. And figure out what to do next. We've had the washer for almost 10 years, and never a need for repair. Who do we call? No idea.

The first time I ever heard the word complementarian was while sitting in a pew at Bethlehem Baptist Church. I can't remember the exact moment, but I knew it was a new concept for me. My early years as a believer were spent sitting under the ministry of John Piper and the elders of Bethlehem. When I walked through those doors my first Sunday I didn't know what "sovereign" meant, let alone how important it was that I was made female and not male. But in my three formative years there I drank abundantly from the spiritual water of God's word. When I walked out of those doors for the last time as a member, I was a changed woman.
My belief in God's good design for men and women was merely an unwatered seed, planted by my Christian mom and dad, in my early Christian days. The weekly proclamation of God's word that came out of that pulpit watered that little seed. And God made it grow.
That's why I am so thankful to have contributed to this new E-book on God's good design in creating us male and female. In the pages of this book you will find a dozen young complementarians who are committed to proclaiming God's glory in how he created us. They want you to see your purpose as an image bearer of our Creator. And they want you to find joy in your differences.
If you want a fresh understanding of what it looks like to live as male or female and find joy in God's good plan, I encourage you to download this book.

The Escola da Esperança aims to impart profound social, ecological and technological knowledge. This is the basis for the development of a global consciousness for the protection of our planet‘s natural resources and for ‘trustful’ cohabitation with all that lives.
We live in a time of constant transformation and redesign. Old ways of thinking and patterns of behavior are proving to be useless; new ones are being developed in many ‘future workshops’ and scientific research centers throughout the world. This dynamic of transformation brings with it a need for the constant reforming of schools and for greater devolution of educational policy and design.
New scientific evidence and ways of thinking lead to new social solutions. The old (Darwinian) paradigm which held ‘survival of the fittest’ as the basis of evolutionary development has been displaced by recent research on cell biology (Lynn Margulis and others). It is now understood that the evolution of life is determined largely by ‘cooperation, creativity and synergies between the individual organisms’ (Lynn Margulis). What a difference in the mind and spirit of a child if he or she does not experience competition and struggle for existence as the key operating principles of life but instead cooperation, communication and creativity. With this attitude completely different social design possibilities can develop.
The team from the Escola da Esperança, together with experts from the different areas of the Peace Research Center Tamera and international learning experts, are developing an ‘internal school curriculum’. It is an expansion and deepening of the content of the Cambridge International Examination (CIE) basic curriculum:

It's admirable how much free content they've put out for the game. Those maps look pretty good, although I'm not a fan at all of Warzone.
Has anyone else downloaded the free Windows 10 version of this? Been working on two maps over the past month and I'd like to start testing them. Figured I'd ask here first.
You can look at them there/download them or we can set up a time to play. I'm guessing no one cares. Whatever.

If Neil and Chris were to produce an Italian girlgroup from Italian X Factor that is. Donatella even cover Love Comes Quickly.

PENTAGRAM: New studio album "Curious Volume" set for release on CD & LP on 28th August 2015, marking the reunion with Peaceville Records
Legendary U.S. heavy/doom metal band PENTAGRAM reunites with Peaceville Records for its new studio album, "Curious Volume", to be released 28th August. Featuring 11 classic heavy metal compositions with catchy hooks from core band members Victor Griffin, Greg Turley, and Bobby Liebling (Pete Campbell on the drums completes the band’s lineup), the album was recorded with Swedish producer Mattias Nilsson at studios located in Maryland and Virginia. Additional recording took place in Tennessee with Grammy-Award-winning producer Travis Wyrick, who also produced PENTAGRAM’s previous album, Last Rites. The album’s cover artwork was provided courtesy of Richard Schouten. To support the new album, the band has tours planned in North America and Europe throughout 2015/2016.
Formed in the early 1970s with a debut album, "Relentless", releasing in 1985, PENTAGRAM has survived through more than four decades filled with adversity and triumph to become the legendary international act it is today, firmly stamping its name into the heavy metal history books. Although once viewed as a cult act but with a strong and dedicated global fan base, PENTAGRAM has enjoyed a recent surge in popularity due in part to the 2011 documentary, Last Days Here, which follows the trials and tribulations of a troubled rock star, PENTAGRAM’s lead singer Bobby Liebling. With a DVD release set for this fall on Peaceville’s label, the documentary has garnered international recognition on the film festival circuit and has won several awards, including “Best Music Documentary” at the International Documentary Film Festival in Amsterdam.
The band recently released their double DVD collection ‘All Your Sins’, featuring over 7 hours of live footage spanning a period of three decades.

At peak times over 90% of traffic travels from Whitford Park Road into Brookby Road or Vise versa. Unfortunately the Stop Sign means that all traffic should come to a stop - most do not but they do slow to less than 5 km/h as the visibility is not the best. However there is virtually no need to stop. If a mini roundabout were put there then Right of way rules would prevent the huge jams we get as soon as the traffic volumes increase. I have been in queues back to Sandstone road and the only issue was the Stop sign - there was no other traffic and no blockage after the stop sign. Many Thanks.
Now in October and there does not appear that any comment has been made in the roundabout suggestion I made in March. Now there are workmen there until December. This would be a perfect time to do the roundabout as the men and machinery are there anyway - or is that too much to ask????

In D'un discours qui ne serait pas du semblant / Actors, Networks, Theories, Vincent Bonin explores the notion of deferred receptions of theories and art through language, context and translations. The book explores the gap between the publication of a text in one language and that of its translation, or between the inaugural presentation of an artwork in one context and its subsequent display.
For Syrians on the run escaping civil war, the mundane act of sending a text message proves to be a crucial line of connection with those left behind, a missive that confirms the survival or death of their loved ones.
In Texting Syria, photographer Liam Maloney examines how, along the journey refugees make from Syria to Lebanon and then Canada, mobile technology supports their struggles, transmitting strength and resistance. Gathered here are portraits, excerpts from text message conversations and images from popular culture that highlight intimate parallel narratives beyond the images disseminated in the media.
Liam Maloney is the recipient of the Dazibao award conferred during the 2015 Mois de la Photo à Montréal.
With Nothing Will Surprise You Here, Velibor Božović has succeeded in infusing a dose of truth which surpasses our desire to cling to reality and facts, letting us be carried along by the self-evidence of events. Nothing surprises us here, but everything eludes us, as if aspirated by that truth held in shadow, so intrinsic that it is only revealed in the abstraction of the unspoken. We might see here an attempt to legitimate fiction as a means of attesting to history, but also a manifestation of the ascendance of the map over the territory.
The present publication is a constituent part of Velibor Božović’s exhibition project Nothing Will Surprise You Here, developed in collaboration with Dazibao.

Shahrāshūb al-Sarawī al-Māzandarānī (Arabic: ابو عبدالله محمّد بن علي ابن شهراشوب السَرَوي المازندراني) (b. 488/1095 - d. 588/1192) known as Ibn Shahrāshūb (Arabic: إبن شهرآشوب) and nicknamed as "Rashid al-Din" and "'Izz al-Din" was among Shi'a scholars in jurisprudence and hadith living in 6th/12th century. He wrote many works such as al-Manaqib and Ma'alim al-'ulama'.
Ibn Sharashub was born in 488/1095 or 489/1096. Some believe that he was originally from "Sari", Mazandaran province, north of Iran. However, some have said that he was born in Baghdad.
It is recorded that he argued with the ruler of Mazandaran and moved to Baghdad and began teaching and preaching there and became so popular that the caliph of his time gifted precious clothes to him.
After a period of staying in Baghdad, he moved to Hillah in 567/1172 and began teaching there. Ibn Idris al-Hilli and Ibn Bitriq learned hadiths from him while accompanying him in his travel to Hillah.
In 573/1178, Ibn Shahrashub went to Aleppo which was the refuge of Shi'a and Hamdanids. He stayed there until the end of his life.
About Ibn Shahrashub, al-Shaykh al-Hurr al-'Amili wrote, "he was a reliable scholar in hadith, rijal and literature, a poet and a collection of all good attributes."[1]
About him, Mirza Husayn Nuri says, "[He is] the honor of Shi'a, crown of religion, best of pioneers and a stormy deep sea with no bottom, the reviver of the works of virtue and merit, fruit of the nation and the religion, sun of Islam and Muslims, Ibn Shahrashub, the jurist, hadith scholar, researcher, …"
Tafrishi wrote, "Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Shahrashub, the leader of Shi'a and their jurist, was an eloquent poet and a writer."[2]
Salah al-Din al-Safdi, a Sunni scholar, wrote, "Muhammad b. 'Ali b. Shahrashub …is one of the noble men of Shi'a. He memorized the Qur'an at the age of eight and reached the ultimate degree of knowledge in Usul. When al-Muqtafi, the Abbasid caliph was in Baghdad, Ibn Shahrashub excelled others in Quranic sciences, difficult issues of hadith studies, lexical knowledge, language syntax and giving speech on the pulpit."[3]
Ibn Shahrashub passed away in Aleppo in the eve of Friday 22nd of Sha'ban 588/9th of September 1192 and was buried on the top of the mountain called Jabal al-Jawshan. Shi'a of Aleppo believe that it is the burial place of Muhsin al-Siqt, son of Imam al-Husayn (a) (Mashhad al-Siqt).
A total of 15 states and Washington, D.have enacted interest rate caps that effectively outlaw any kind of payday lending, whether its from storefronts or online companies, according personal loan says i cant the Center for Responsible Lending, a consumer advocacy group based in Durham, North Carolina. Still, even in those states, consumers can access digital lenders.
Many of these companies claim that because they operate online, state law doesnt apply to them. As with the tribal lands issue, this question is still open to debate.
In that regard, the law is ambiguous, said Barden of the Online Lending Alliance. Most of the trade groups members dont loan in states that prohibit it, he said, but the Alliance doesnt take a position on whether or not the practice is illegal. Though no federal law prohibits payday lending, some restrictions do exist. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act, for example, prohibits lenders from only allowing consumers to repay loans through recurring electronic payments -- something that payday lenders do regularly, consumer advocates say.
Additionally, guidance issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in 2005 says that payday loans should not be made to anyone who has already been in debt from a payday loan for three months or more of the previous year.
Awesome payment plans and very flexible. Great people and service. They are fast and reliable. Best installment loans for over 1000 if you got poor credit. The Contenders. Great customer service. These people run a top notch business in my opinion.
Always professional, I am able to get a loan very fast and one time, when I had left my DL at home, was able to get a loan with no ID (store manager recognized me as a regular). Very nice people easy to work with.

I got an email today wondering whether I'd gotten to a sample someone sent awhile back. No, I hadn't received it yet, should I have? Yes, it was delivered two weeks ago, my buddy sent me the tracking info. So I call the receiving room. I knew I was in trouble when the guy on the other end asked me to repeat the number, then repeated it back to me. No, they have no record of it. I say it was signed for by so-and-so two weeks ago. Yes, he works in the receiving room, would I mind being put on hold. I'm cut off, but do hear back about five minutes later, yes, they did receive the package, no idea what happened to it. It will take some time.
Now, all package tracking at work is 100% electronic, so if he's verified that they did receive the package, he knows exactly what happened to it. But an hour-plus later, I hear back that, yes, they did deliver it to somebody in another building. I figured that maybe my buddy had put the wrong address or something, so I go over to the office it had been delivered to. Nope, no package there, couldn't imagine why they'd say my package had been delivered to that location. I showed the signature, which belonged to the occupant of that office. Geez, that was a couple of weeks ago, no idea what could have happened to a package in that time. I'm getting a bit agitated, and this person finally says, well, maybe it had been delivered to another office and she just signed for it. So we stroll down the hall to a couple other offices with packages in them, and lo and behold, there's my package. Which had been sitting there for two weeks.
There were three screwups that I can think of that had to happen for this to go this wrong. It had my mail stop, my building, and my mailstop's room #, all of which were different from where it was delivered. So shipping and receiving screwed up royally. But they handle several hundred packages a day; I can see how one falls through the cracks now and then. (The guy on the phone still gave me the runaround, though.) The person it was delivered to saw that it didn't belong in her office (the tracking says which office it was delivered to in addition to who signed for it), but instead of calling me, just took it to another office it didn't belong in. And then in its final resting place, it sat for two weeks and that person didn't get in touch either, although s/he must have noticed that there was a package addressed to someone in another building sitting on the desk.
This is the third time this has happened to me in the last few years -- a package goes to the wrong place, it takes me some time to realize it (I don't always know when someone is sending me something), and the person who gets the errant package takes no action whatsoever. I can't tell whether it's apathy, stupidity, passing the buck, or what. But it bothers the s4!t out of me.
Could've been worse... never located package... or someone else keeps it. All in all its a happy ending.
BTW, speaking of rants: I had recently been given Dunkin Donuts gift cards with ten large cups on each. When the card is used up the receipt indicates there are no more cups left. So I've asked at several of the D&Ds here how many cups are left on card because I don't keep the receipts? And several of the employees at differing D&Ds cannot read their own receipts or read their cash register which also indicates the number left on card. Rant over.
And several of the employees at differing D&Ds cannot read their own receipts or read their cash register which also indicates the number left on card.
you're correct in terms of standard netspeak. But one doesn't always have to speak in netspeak, even on the net.
I'm sorry for being unclear. My comment was meant to indicate that there is no pride to be had from the performance of those individuals. In the language of the internet, "They give no f#*@ks". They are neither seeking nor achieving anything worthy of pride.
Is there any likelihood that they're simply overworked, and have no time to worry about things that are clearly someone else's problem?
And now there was no doubt that the trees were really moving - moving in and out through one another as if in a complicated country dance. ('And I suppose,' thought Lucy, 'when trees dance, it must be a very, very country dance indeed.')
I’m seeing less pride in workmanship these days even in established firms with a solid reputation for quality work. Every shop, except one, I have dealt with over the last five years has returned the work with errors in workmanship. Not low quality work. Errors, things that don’t work. If I have the time, I do it myself. If not, I grit my teeth, swear softly and get on with it.
The main lead screw on my new lathe was ridiculously bent. Like in two feet, probably 50-100 thousandths. I saved 50% by not going with one I knew would be good, but am losing two months using it (assuming all the new stuff solves the problems I was having). Possibly a net gain, but awfully frustrating.
My husband came home with the Thursday NYTimes last week, which had an article about a bread recipe from Sullivan Street Bakery in NYC. It's a recipe that you don't knead - in fact you do very little to it at all and it comes out just great.
I sent the link to Rainey - knowing how that girl likes bread - and today she shared she's on her second loaf! And since her kitchen is DOWN, she's been cooking it on the bar-be-cue! She's the one who reminded me it would be a fun post on C&Z.
So here's the link. There is also a video on this link that explains step by step and you can see what it should look like as you go.
Sam just used the given recipe the first time. The next time he used a combo of whole grain, spelt, semolina & millet with coarse ground corn meal and oat bran for the top. It is delicious and the crust is as crrisp as a cracker! Sam's opinion is that if you use more whole grain with this recipe, you should increase the yeast a tad. What do you think Rainey?
Actually, spelt and semolina have gluten so no need for additional yeast there. And if you stay in the 2-3 parts white flour (spelt & semolina included) to 1 part whole wheat the amount of yeast should be fine. OTOH, additional rise time might be needed and a lower loaf should be expected. No matter, I'll bet it was/is going to be delish!
If you've never baked your own bread before, now is the time. Jim Lahey says that a 4 year old could do this bread. OK, there's no way a 4yo would have a 20 hour attention span. But the mixing couldn't be easier. For my second one I even used my hand like Lahey does in the video. ....veeeeerrrrrryyyyyy 4yo.
Many people are finding that after they make their first loaf they want to increase the amount of salt in the second one.
Aside to Donna: When I was teaching pre-school I always did a unit where I brought bread dough into the classroom. There's something so wonderful about the feel of it and the kids loved handling it and loved getting their shapes baked. I gotta say after all that "love" that was some tough bread but, all in all, a very popular unit.
God writes a lot of comedy... the trouble is, he's stuck with so many bad actors who don't know how to play funny. -- Garrison Keillor
Well, lookee! SlashFood does a rundown this morning of what the concept is  with a lovely photo of what great results you can get with practically no effort  and links to many of the places where the blogosphere is on fire with this: http://www.slashfood.com/2006/11/16/no-knead-bread-takes-over-the-world/ How timely!
First priority though is to make a roast dinner.... maybe I will need to make the bread to have leftover roast sandwiches the next day??!
If you cannot feel your arteries hardening, eat more cheese. If you can, drink more red wine. Diet is just "die" with a "t" on the end. Exercise is walking into the kitchen.
For lunch I just finished a slice of my walnut & green onion bread, buttered with shards of blue cheese. I had it with butternut squash & apple soup (from Costco if anyone is near one). Pretty freakin' awesome!
Wait 'til you see a shaggy, floppy mass of dough transformed into bread! I got the only crackling crust I've ever achieved in 30+ years of breadmaking!
Thanks for the tips. Will check back on this thread before getting adventurous in a new kitchen with unfamiliar oven etc.
I read the NY Times article last week and was drooling well before the end, but I have to ask: don't you miss the kneading? It's my favorite part of making bread (other than eating the product, of course!).
birgit- What fun! I love the automatic translation. And the the duck and chestnut stew looks soooo good. A perfect companion to fresh baked earthy bread.
As if that weren't enough, there's a pic of chestnuts in their husk. We used to have what we called a "horse" chestnut tree in our yard when I was a kid. I loved to open those hoary husks and find the perfectly smooth and shiny nuts inside. Two of 'em smooshed close together so one side was very round and one entirely flat. Some years later some disease hit the trees and took most if not all the chestnut trees out of the NE. But I have my happy memories and your nifty photo to remind me.
So, are you brewing some dough? Hope you'll tell us how it works for you. Meanwhile, isn't it amazing how fast this thing is making it's way around the world!?
I tried the bread this weekend and indeed: looks gorgeous! However, the taste was still that of bland white bread (expectations too high?) and the texture wasn't quite to my liking: way too rubbery, or maybe 'glutinous' is a better word. The airiness of the bread was lovely, but I like my crumb to honour its name and be at least a little crumbly and not go 'poing' when I pull at it.
We'll give the recipe another go with wholegrain, and if that's no good either I'll try an ordinary bread in the dutch oven. Because the crust was to die for!
carina- Did you increase the salt? People are pretty universally finding that 2 teaspoons of salt works as well and tastes better. And many are throwing in at least some other grains and herbs as well.
Nevertheless, it shouldn't have been rubbery. Could it have been undercooked? Did you leave it uncovered for the final phase?
I started my first loaf last night, but 12 hours later it doesn't look much different. I thought the top was supposed to bubble.
Sam has made three loaves so far and not a rubbery bite in the bunch. His has a lovely crumb and of course the crust to die for!
I printed out the English translation of the German rye recipe - quite comical. I'm sure that we will have a batch of that soon, as Sam ADORES rye bread (He had a lovely Deutsche Oma). I adore having such a wonderful bread baker in the house!
Wheatberries sounds like a great addition Rainey. He was going to try onions & sunfower seeds, at my urging, but maybe I'll re-direct him!
Rainey - Possibly it was slightly undercooked, I took it out after 30 mins covered and 14-15 mins uncovered because the top was getting rather dark.
Next time I'll try a wholemeal loaf, baked a little longer at a slightly lower temperature. Because boy of boy, that crust... devine!
I think it's time to start looking for a good sourdough starter somewhere around here. Good sourdough with a devine crust would go down a treat!
Barbara- I've done it three time and not the same way or the same result yet. ...but all good. I must say, in my first 20 hour ferment I get some rise in the first half but the liquidey bubbles don't appear until the latter half (when I couldn't say because I try to start my bread around 5pm one day and shape and finish around noon the next day; the serious ferment seems to happen in those early hours when I'm asleep). As for the second rise, there's some in the 2 hours at room temp but the largest part of it seems to happen in the oven spring.
I got my roundest boule with the singing crust and huge, irregular crumb when I mixed the dough in my bread machine (avec kneading of the very wet dough) and the full amount of water. Of course, that was the loaf I burned on the BBQ.
I'm still experimenting with the optimum BBQ conditions and whether that machine knead makes a difference or not.
I have made mine primarily with white bread (hard wheat) flour but I've added from a couple tablespoons to 1/2 a cup of whole wheat flour plus 1 tablespoon each of semolina or fine cornmeal and rye. I don't know that that's enough to change the flavor particularly, but the keeping quality is excellent. We've had good bread for 3 days.

So, let me get this straight. Instead of doing the normal MMO thing and allowing people in the expansion zones right away (as long as you're max level or close) with a possible 'fast track' through vanilla content to get everyone caught up and playing the expansion, you actually have to go through the entire story (including the fetch-quest heavy stuff they added in patches as well as a whole lot of dungeons) and progress your gear using the same old currencies until you're finally past the attunement / gating?
All that can easily take a month of play, or more. How are the "I left this game x years ago with a non-endgame character and bought the expansion to see its content" people reacting? Does this also apply to the new classes?!
You cannot unlock the new classes without access to the city in the expansion, so you cannot even play those until you progress through the old story.
Also the main story quests you get starting at level 50 now give higher-end gear, which means you'll reach the gear item level without having to run a bunch of random dungeons to get geared.
It's Square. What else would you expect? They are still on a monthly sub and have to milk that for what it's worth. It's a Japanese grinder, plain and simple.
This is true but it is fun for a while. I played for a few months and liked it until it made me cranky and tired.
Exactly the same reaction. 50 Scholar and I just got frustrated with stuff. Nothing specific though. Loved the setting and the feel and the look of the game. Even played well, but it was a shell of FFXI.
Downloading the Free Trial; never played a FF game (including FFXI), don't know anything about the setting. This will be interesting
" He's so impatient, it's like watching a teenager fuck a glorious older woman." - Ironwood on J.J. Abrams
Every single goddamn voice is now British. Yugiri's is some sort of weird whatever, but everyone sounds like they've been ripped from a theatrical production of Harry Potter. It's grating.
New content is nice, but this is just strange. I have no idea why they would do this. Well other than, "this was cheaper".
I imagine it was less cost-related and more related to scheduling with the ARR voice actors. From what I understand, most everything pre-Heavensward was recorded back when 2.0 was still in development, and it wasn't until the expac was in development did new stuff need to be recorded.
Some of the VAs are still the same, and a couple are still the same, but with different voice direction.
I'm trying to play this with friends and while it's pretty okay in dungeons the leveling experience is fucking dreadful.
Once you hit 14/15, you should probably just level through dungeons and do the story quest line just for the unlocks. Relatively few unlocks are outside of it.
Square Enix is suspending sales of the Mac version and offering refunds to those who want them. Apparently a lot of hipsters were having problems running it on their 8 year old Macs or couldn't get it going at all.
Seriously, unless you want to just keep playing Bejeweled, Farmville, Angry Birds or some random indie 16 bit platformer, get a PC FFS. PC Master Race 4Life.
First of all, this game has something like 10 million active subscriptions, trying as much as possible to prove that very traditional MMORPGs (tab targeting, slow global cooldown, not free to play) are far from being dead.
But the latest news is about a recent expansion which added instanced housing that still comes in limited supplies (!), and since we have been talking to Raph an UO lately I can't help but feel that it's 1997 land rush all over again! I'm loving it!
As I set out to grab my own plot in the new Shirogane district, those queues made for one of the reasons I was unable to meet the mad rush into the server. When you know there’s only 720 plots available and your game launches with “you’re 960th in queue,” it’s over.
But congrats to them on outpacing WoW. It's well deserved, and one of the only mulligans in MMOs to actually be successful. I should come back for 4.1, since I gave up on Destiny 2 for now.
"Tuning me out doesn't magically change the design or implementation of said design. Though, that'd be neat if it did." -schild
Well, I could agree with you but the reality is that MMORPGs are ALL about the fluff. There is not a single thing that isn't fluff in MMORPGs.
I suppose. I can understand limiting guild housing for the semi-serious to serious guilds that are involved with the game, as that makes them special and adds a return for their involvement in the game. I don't understand the limitation on apartment housing for individual players. Didn't everyone just get a free customizable apartment in FF XI? Aside from having to actually save and store the data, what the difference between the four-walled instanced area I get put in when I (if ever) check into a town inn and going to a four-walled instanced apartment?
I don't think they've passed WoW; the 10 million figure is total accounts, of which WoW has over 100m.
Everyone can buy an instanced apartment nowadays, those are not limited. It's the (land) plots where you can build an actual house that are limited.
Instanced apartments are absolutely limited in number. It's a much higher number, but they're still very limited and on pretty much any decently populated server, every apartment is spoken for.
My bad. I must have mixed them with the instanced housing in the FC mansions. It also seems that at least Hyperion (which is not the most populated server) has lots of room in the apartments at Shirogane.
this game is such a fucken turd, the fact that there is no real job system or depth... in fact, all mmos have been so bad i think im going home.. back to FFXI.
Translation: This game is too easy. People get stuff that I do, so how can I lord it over them. I'm going back to a game where only .01% even see the last half of the game, as God intended.
So, no matter my above post fom 2 years ago, I've only been playing this game for a week. I purchased the basic edition because, what the hell, a big chunk of the game coming with a 30 days subscription for only $9.99...why not.
I can only talk about my initial leveling experience (which is now accelerated below lv 60, and I dislike XP boosts I can't toggle off) with a pugilist, who is now lv 18.
There is a lot of stuff to do, big city hub is not confusing, but I really don't like the fact that the crafting teachers are spread among the big cities (I really would like to start leatherworking but I'm still stuck in the zones outside Ul'dah. Being able to potentially learn everything and instantly switch between professions is interesting, but of course I still have to experience that to its full potential.
Now, I never played a FF game, so I'm not into the world, characters lore or anything, but I'm finding the leveling experience very, VERY dull (I'm more of a roleplaying/leveling/alt guy rather than an endgame fanatic). I guess it inevitably comes to a matter of personal taste, but in the very recent past I played (and still playing):
All three are better than FFXIV when it comes, at least, to the early leveling experience. Yes, even nowadays EQ2, IMO. Anyway, I'll keep playing (because, like I said, the overall experience is undoubtedly very smooth and organized) and see if it gets better.
Unless you like/need crafting, forget about it. Focus on leveling a class/job and enjoy the single-player story. You can always come back and do crafting when you've unlocked "all the things", which makes crafting easier anyways.
In regards to the story, yes, it's dull at first; coming off the huge-ass mulligan they did from version 1 was hard. I can affirm that it gets better, esp. once you get to the end. The Heavensward and Stormblood story lines are much more refined and fleshed out.
At launch, the single player story was fucking awful and forever taking. Constant running back and forth fedex quest bullshit mixed with dumb cutscenes, all of which gated major gameplay systems. Combined with slow combat and slow movement speed, it made me never want to roll an alt.
I have been wanting to love this game since launch and then relaunch. I have put money into it twice (for me and my partner), I installed and uninstalled and reinstalled about four times in different years, and I still cannot enjoy it. Say what you want but Grunk is right in my opinion especially because this is the successor of a specific game and that inevitably carries some expectations along with the distinctive traits of that game. Sure, the MMORPG landscape has changed but the result is, in my unpopular opinion, such a watered down and dull experience that managed to bring me back to it over and over simply because of the wonderful graphics, visuals, musics and all that the world has to offer from an aesthetic point of view.
MMORPGs have been mostly a solo experience for a long time now, but in the case of Final Fantasy this is even more disappointing. I am not asking for punishment, I am not asking for an insanely slow level grind, but to see games like Final Fantasy XIV and EQ2 transformed into clicker games where all you have to do is fedex left and right as fast and efficiently as you can to eventually get to the fun or the parts where you HAVE to group is boring and dull as hell to me.
I understand that FF14 requires grouping later on, but I just can't get to that later on. As I said, I tried so many times including a month ago. I always stop around level 18 - 23. The leveling is SO INCREDIBLY DULL. The old style combat could be great if the game posed some sort of an old style challenge. When you pretty much kill everything super easily for 20+ levels, absolutely by yourself, but have to do it at 1 mph, I have to give up.
After the golden years, MMORPGs started to have a hard time convincing people that needing to play with other people was fun, so they switched to solo experiences in a shared universe and locked only bits under the grouping wall. Realizing that was becoming pretty tedious and losing the novely effect a lot of companies started to put the fun in the combat itself. Since you had to do the same thing over and over for weeks, the least they could do was to make it flashy. But FF14 forgot to add that part. They wanted to look and feel similar to the old school days in many departments, and just left us with this incredibly tedious SOLO and slo-mo leveling experience.
I understand there is a lot to like in FF14 and I have tried so many times to get to that part. This just does not work for me cause it creates a clear dissonance between what I am brought to believe/hope/wish (a modernized Old School experience, a 2010s version of EQ and FF11) and what it actually is (a slower, Japanese take on WoW).
I forgot to mention. Itemization in the first 20 levels is the least interesting in the history of MMORPG.s That didn't exactly propels the fun or the desire to grow for me.
I agree with a lot of your analysis, but for me the thing that finally wore me down to a nubbin was the awfully lazy quest writing. Not the story writing, which is anywhere from bad to great, but the quests themselves are at first hilariously stupid and then once the joke wears off, an indicator of the condescension the writers have for their player base. Having you fetch a glass of milk for someone right next to the purveyor of milk is fine as a gag quest, but they use it as a dang model, and its just pure filler. I don't know why they do this, or how it even goes unnoticed by the creator himself, since its clear he loves his franchise, but its like they're terrified players are going to tire of their game the moment the story is over so they stuff their story with pointless humiliating quests. So ya, fuck this game.
I should get back to nature, too. You know, like going to a shop for groceries instead of the computer. Maybe a condo in the woods that doesn't even have a health club or restaurant attached. Buy a car with only two cup holders or something.
Looks like a raid in the vein of FFVI is coming. Would be fantastic if the Phantom Train is suplexable.
The ultimate fix would be to allow alts to skip the MSQ once you bring one character through it. However, changing your appearance (which is essentially what an alt is, especially in a game where one character can be all the classes) and skipping MSQ are cash shop items. Cash shop in a sub game lol.
Well, yeah. Honestly I don't know why one would need an alt in this game. Probably why they have a cheaper sub price if you just roll one toon.
Appearance is a big thing to many. And of course, to many it's not. Fantasia is in the cash shop because people buy it.
Well, if anyone is still playing and happens to be on Faerie, feel free to look me up or send a tell. I'm this name, of course.
Right now, I'm still enjoying the game, although I'm also trying to get through the ARR quests so I can open up Heavensward finally. Level 55 and I haven't started any other jobs yet, but I'm sure I will eventually.
Early Registration will be closing at 11:59 PM on May 12th. After that, you'll have to register in person during the convention.
Early registration will now be closing on Tuesday, May 14, 2013 to accomodate Swap Meet Registration (opening on Monday at noon)
The Black and White Ball is returning this year better than ever! The dance floor will be huge, the playlist will be extensive, and the night will definitely be one to remember!
For more details as to what formal attire entails, please follow the guidelines in the dress code below.
Please note: The Dress Code will be strictly enforced — we will be denying entry to individuals wearing inappropriate attire.
Opaque (not see-through) dresses or skirts that extend to the top of the knee cap at its highest point (including slits and asymmetrical hems)
Note: If you are wearing a dress/skirt that is at the approved length, but would like to wear leggings underneath it, leggings will be allowed.
Dresses or skirts that go higher than the top of the knee cap at its highest point (including slits and asymmetrical hems)
Dresses or skirts that are see-through above the top of the knee cap (including asymmetrical hems and lining)
This event was fantastic last year and we are expecting an amazing turn out this year as well. We hope that everyone will enjoy the ball and have a great time, so that is why this thread is being posted.
If you have any questions or concerns over your outfit for the Ball, post them here. You can even post a picture of your outfit/cosplay here and we will let you know if it will be acceptable for the Black and White Ball. If you would like your outfit to be a surprise until FanimeCon, you may also send us an email at bwball@fanime.com and we will get back to you with an answer as soon as we are able to.
If the leggings are opaque, and the skirt was a few inches above the knee (all part of a White Rabbit cosplay), would that be okay?
I'm hoping to do a Splicer inspired outfit and I have some questions to see what would be allowed. I intend on wearing a mask with a small amount of fake blood on it, is that acceptable? I also wanted to wear ripped stockings, not too heavily done but still clearly visible. My dress will be normal and of an acceptable length, so it's just the minor details I'm concerned with.
Sorry, this may be a dumb question, but is the dress code strictly black and white if we're not cosplaying?
Nope, wear whatever colors you like! Just follow the dress code posted above about what to wear and you should be fine.
the skirt itself has to be the appropriate length, which is to the top of the knee itself. leggings opaque is fine, but the skirt itself needs to be the proper length
i personally can't answer the question about the mask; but the ripped stockings should be okay. again we're more concerned with the dress/skirt itself than the accessories that come with it. i will let a more senior member of the ball staff answer about the mask.
there's no rule against cardigans/sweaters. the only thing that we are really looking for is the length of the dress. no matter how long/short your cardigan is, your dress itself must be the appropriate length.
a note about cardigans/jackets/sweaters. there is no coat check, so if you put your jacket down somewhere, its your responsibility to keep track of it.
I just purchased a prom type dress it's all the way down to my feet so I don't worry about length but it doesn't have straps.
It's a strapless so should I just wear a cute little over jacket or a cardigan? Or should I attach straps?
strapless dresses are fine. i've personally worn strapless dresses before. as long as the dress stays UP, then you're fine.
i believe hats are okay for the most part. it must be part of the costume and if you put it down, it's your responsibility to keep track of it.
Awesome thanks!! It actually has a corseted piece in the back where I can tighten the top so I will make sure it doesn't come down at all
@Olivine - wearing a mask is fine, though if you plan to dance and it obstructs your vision we recommend that you don't wear it so as to reduce the likelihood of running into people. It will be a fairly crowded floor.
I'm planning on wearing a traditional saree to the Ball (Blue Diamond cosplay), but traditional sarees typically come with halter tops due to shirt fabric twisting under the pull of the skirt. I intend to solve this problem by simply wearing a leotard underneath to hide my skin, but would it be alright if the leotard was skin colored so as not to ruin the look of the saree?
Do the jackets have to be buttoned up? Do the shirts have to be completely buttoned up? I'm talking about leaving the collar left unbuttoned.
Freedom Studios has come to a close after years of being alive. However, we're not completely gone since we're simply moving shop to a new location.
First the pump. I placed it high above a lava pool (in the nether) and without any redstone engine attached, or switch placed near it, the pump extends its pipe down to the lava. I attached a redstone and a switch but turning on the switch starts the redstone engine but stops the pump....wha? Does the pump no longer need external power?
The miner. I ran the lava from the pump to a geothermal generator via pipes, then placed the miner next to the generator. So far so good. I put in a drill and one of the scanners (I forget which), nothing happens yet. I then put in the mining pipe into the top middle slot and it springs to life spewing blocks out the side, ignoring a transport pipe attached to the other side.
To stop the spewing I placed a chest next to the miner and it stopped. I mean it stopped running and mining. The chest has a redstone engine on a wooden pipe. Not sure if it is close enough to interfere though. Anyhow, I take the drill out and the thing starts working for a bit, then the mining pipe exits the miner and goes into the chest...more what the fuck.
Pump should need power, and redstone engine should suffice. You can see how we have the one set up in the back of the workshop. Maybe the redstone signal going to the engine is somehow conflicting with the pump itself?
Phoebes is the expert on the IC2 miners. The reason it pulled up the mining pipe when you pulled out the drill, though, is because that's what it does when it's either done digging or has no drill to dig with.
That's the messed up thing. With the redstone off, the pump sends lava to the geo but not when it is on.
Good to know about the drill. I'll take everything out of the miner and put it back in, see if that helps.
Hey, I missed this! How did you get it working in Virtual PC? I have the 2004 edition, and it refuses to boot AROS
Im not a big fan of VMWare -That was a May 2008 nightly build on VPC 2007 getting the more recent build to work might be a pain - mention it on Aros Forum.
Ja, I tried AROS on VMware, it was - like someone said before me - like using OS1.3... empty Maybe this will help (courtesy of OSH )
I made a few Live CDs -clones of my above setup these were fine for running Amiga games but for Classic apps I wanted to use FileSystem2 wich wasnt working.
I haven't really made much headway with AROS, I'm afraid. I collect the files as they are released, meaning to spend some time with them, but I never quite seem to get back to it. It's too far down my list of priorities, I suppose, and I suspect it's gonna take a lot of effort, too.
i downloaded Aros it looks cool could anyone tell me is it an Amiga clone or is it just emulating Amiga with uae or something
Like your PC running Windows (or Linux, if that's your bag), the Amiga runs an operating system called AmigaOS. Applications written for the Amiga, for the most part, called parts of the OS to do stuff like read and write from the drives, draw windows, manage screens etc. It was, without a shadow of a doubt, the nicest OS in existence at the time.
AROS is a new operating system. You could replace windows with it (though that's not recommended as yet - there's a lot of work to be done with it). It reproduces not only the look and feel of AmigaOS, but also allows applications to make the same calls to the OS to draw windows and manage I/O etc. The end result is basically a Workbench on your PC. Unlike an emulator, it's all native code and so is very fast. It's not terribly bloated, like Windows is.
Applications written in an OS-friendly manner for AmigaOS could, in theory, be compiled with very little modification under AROS.
Where you may be confused is the VMWare/VirtualPC editions of AROS - they run on an emulated PC, but AROS is still not an emulator - you're emulating a PC that is running AROS.
tried it with qemu but it was painfully slow so will have to wait until SATA support is added as my dvd drive and HDDs all use sata
My biggest problem with AROS was trying to decide whether it would run applications compiled for Amiga OS, and how to transfer them into the AROS environment. Now it seems it does not, and so there's no point in trying to import those applications.
grate stuff so lets hope it takes off it sounds great an os that can run it's own stuff and Amiga stuff to now that's cool
...I'm not sure where they are up to but I understand the 'plan' is to integrate UAE (or at least a 68k core) into the OS. That way all 'well written' apps will run direct without the need for a recompile.
As all the calls are the same, I'd expect the bulk of calls could be handled by the x86-native OS, so in theory you'd have a solution similar to Amithlon but even faster - and of course a development path with new apps being written.
I'm really looking forward to AROS getting to the point where a genuinely useful distro can be produced...
...maybe it's because I have a pathological hatred of all things *NIX (esp the Li versions) but I'm convinced there's room for a lightweight Geeks OS lacking all the bloat / complexity of the most common offerings about today. Frankly AmigaOS / AROS is / will be more than up to the job of a single-user desktop OS...
...there's still a lot of peeps who look fondly on their Amiga days who would be tempted to give such a distro a try, who I believe would be pleasantly surprised by how functional AmigaOS is with good hardware under it...
SpecOS (under development, albeit slowly) mimics a Sinclair Spectrum but takes advantage of better hardware - highres screen, better sound support, mass-storage etc. Retains all that made the Speccy great, like the immediately available BASIC (enhanced, of course), virtually instant boot time, simple memory model - flat memory, with no memory protection other than the OS, Video RAM exposed as part of the main memory etc. It would be single-tasking though, like the old Speccy. A very simple, but fun OS.
AROS is similar, being very lightweight (though not that lightweight - my 486 can't run it) and very fast.
If you have source, you can recompile those apps for AROS, assuming they don't so anything with the hardware directly - early Amiga stuff almost certainly did, but later apps from the 3.0 era were much better behaved.
One thing that really annoys me about all 'modern' OS's is their habit of claiming ALL the resources on the system, & then (maybe) free up enough to let the user get a look in after the fact...
...let's face it. CP/M did just about everything one could expect of an OS on early hardware - everything else is *just* eye-candy. IMO it's unforgivable that as hardware has developed OS's are actually taking a higher proportion of system resources than they used to and don't bring anything new to the user.
I know there's an argument that filling your system is just good resource management but as an example:
If I'm watching the telly I'd like my legs to be available to take me to the loo in an advert break. I'm not so sure I'd like the idea of having to apply to the local utility company first to get their use back because they'd been using my legs to power a dynamo...
The AROS ports of UAE I have saved on a hard disk somewhere... But AmiBridge is set to make VmwAROS much more useful.
Also, it's great to see E-UAE being extended by o1i. It's such a long time without news from Richard Drummond on E-UAE.
And Charlie, I always have empathy for Amiga fanboy dreaming. Don't we all do it? If I'd bought an A1200 when they first appeared I would have been astounded by what it could do compared to the PC systems I was using at that time. They could have had the world in their hands at that time. I often wonder what better systems we would all be using now if things had turned out differently...
You have to try this out!!! Latest Downlad download the latest version of the file mingw32-i386-system.
Since there were some fixes applied to AROS during development of this version, it is required to have AROS system files from 2009.02.24 or later.
ClusterUK is pleased to announce that we are now shipping the VmwAros powered iMica system from 1st March. We held off while network driver was completed and OWB started to ship. Remember profits go into Aros drivers for the unit which will benefit other platforms.
Version 0.2 of Janus-UAE has been uploaded to AROS archives. If you start it, you'll get an e-uae with picasso96 support for AROS. http://archives.aros-exec.org/index....ae.i386.tar.gz
also expecting a new version of VmwAros from paolone soon. With OWB and Mplayer set up ready to go!!
AROS has always been one of my favorite alternate OS platforms. With the PPC Amiga-like makers seeming uninterested in high-end hardware anymore (both the EFIKA and the Sam440 are based on 603-derived embedded SoCs rather than the nicer G3/G4 hardware of the previous generation), AROS really is quickly becoming the only solution for Amiga-like computing on modern hardware.
Google’s announced plans to delay the public release of the source code for Honeycomb, the tablet version of Android, are causing some indignation to be vented among the partisans of open source. But should it? This is a good time to reflect on what the freedoms guaranteed by the Open Source Definition actually mean and what they’re for.
I’ve been thinking recently about writing a shared-memory export for gpsd. The JSON-over-sockets client interface we have is very powerful and flexible, but more than is needed when network access to the server is not required. For embedded deployments, in particular – it would be useful to have a lower-overhead way of shipping results to clients.
Consequently, I’ve been thinking about coherence techniques for shared memory. In this particular case, we have one writer (gpsd) and multiple readers (the application clients). Updates to the shared-memory segment are long enough that writes aren’t guaranteed atomicity. It is permissible for a client to miss an update if it’s not inspecting the segment frequently enough, but required that after a read from the segment the client can always tell when it has a coherent update (as opposed to having read the segment while a write is in progress).
The obvious way to ensure update coherence would be with a semaphore. But a technique that is non-blocking and wait-free would be preferable. I have invented a method I call “bookend consistency”. I present it here for public critique, also because I’m curious whether any of my commenters can identify it with a known, published algorithm. It was inspired by a vague, distant memory of pioneering work by Butler Lampson on lock-free algorithms.
(No, that is not the ultimate Armed & Dangerous post title. The ultimate Armed & Dangerous post title would be Naked Women With Guns Smash The State! .)
A few nights ago I was on IRC with a friend I shall refer to as ‘H’ who may, if she wishes, identify herself in a comment, discussing rape statistics; she had been a post-rape counselor and I thought she would have a useful on-the-ground perspective. H shared my evaluation that the rape statistics I reported are seriously inflated by definitional flimflam, but that’s not our topic this evening. This post is, instead, stimulated (as it were) by her thoughts on the subject of pornography.
A very curious thing happened with GPSD this week. In fact it’s so odd I’m still having trouble believing it. In software engineering we often have trouble getting seemingly simple things to work reliably. How does one react when an incredibly complex, fragile piece of bit-twiddling code works – perfectly – after six years without real-world testing, during which the surrounding architecture underwent such massive changes that any rational person would have expected the feature to bit-rot into garbage?
No, really, this one is weird. Let me unfold to you the strange tale of The RTCM2 Analyzer That Shouldn’t Have Worked. Really. At All.
Fundamentally, it’s because I think the value of political persuasion is decreasing fast. Political persuasion matters most when when policy options are relatively open and unconstrained by objective conditions that politics cannot alter. It matters less when policy options are more constrained, and not at all when there are no choices left.
The political system I have been criticizing all my adult life is fast approaching the point of “no choices left”. And not just in the U.S., either; the same problems of political overcommitment and structural insolvency are playing out in advanced nations all over the planet.
Earlier today I stumbled over some accusations that atheists are lining up with Islam because their actual enemy is not religion but Christianity.
The actual revelation here is that the fever-swamps of the left are capable of generating unlimited amounts of nonsense and putting it on protest signs. And, that conservatives are still prone to respond with a kind of reflexive bigotry that undermines them even when they have valid points to make.
I’m one of those “militant atheists” Tatler and Publius Forum are ranting about. My position is slightly complicated by the fact that I’m also a neopagan mystic – but the sort of “religion” I practice is nontheistic and fully compatible with philosophical atheism. This is not as unusual as one might think: many neopagans and Buddhists could say the same.
In hopes that some conservatives might actually pay attention, I will now explain how “militant atheists” evaluate different religions and why Islam is actually the least likely of them to attract or seduce atheists. The model I’m about to convey is explicitly shared by one of the major “New Atheist” writers – Sam Harris – and I am in little doubt that the others in that group (notably Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, and Daniel Dennett) would broadly approve of it.
OK, to prepare for this read up on the legend of Lady Godiva, and then read the lyrics of the Beatles’ Lady Madonna. You might want to take the three minutes or so to watch it being performed.
A commenter on a recent thread claimed “the lifetime risk of rape for a woman [in the U.S.] is one in six…Almost everyone who deals with the issue considers that wildly too low to be realistic. But one in six is indisputable.”
No incidence of rape above zero is acceptable to me. I teach women pistol self-defense at no charge. You may correctly infer my motives from the fact that the first time a female student of mine shoots a good tight center-of-mass group, my normal mode of expressing approval is to say “That’s one dead rapist!”
Accordingly, I found this claim so disturbing that I decided to research it. What I found appears to be a classic case of unreliable statistics being oversimplified through rumor, hysteria, the telephone effect, and self-serving inflation.
There’s been some discussion in response to my post on A natural contemplates game on the meaning of the term “alpha male” as it applies to humans. In comments, I had this to say as a definition:
As I use “alpha”, it simply means someone who is equipped for leadership roles by psychology and temperament. You can tell you are one if your experience of life frequently includes being sucked into leadership vacuums. It’s not about having some sort of dark desire to dominate people, though of course there’s a subset of alphas that has that.
In the PUA context, “alpha” has the additional overlapping meaning of someone who has high hypergamic value to women. These two traits tend to be correlated and to reinforce each other.
I don’t really know what makes alphas; I wasn’t always one myself, formerly having been what another commenter describes as a sigma [strong loner type, resistant to being in hierarchies]. In fact, for personal values reasons I denied to myself that I was an alpha until long after a third-party observer would have said so, facing the reality only when my pattern of constantly being sucked into leadership vacuums became undeniable.
I will further note that alphaness is not altogether a happy trait to have. The getting more sex part is nice, but the constant “somebody has to do it” presented by the leadership vacuums around you can be a serious pain in the ass. Especially if, like me, you have values conflicts about being an authority figure.
..there was never a lot of “reaching out” involved on my part. The damn leadership roles reached out and grabbed me. Once I realized I was stuck with them, I just tried to handle the job as competently as I could.
I’m not sure what else to tell you, except that I still think people who crave leadership roles are not to be trusted. The reason I denied I was an alpha for a long time is that I had some confusion in my head between the sort of person who wants to run things and the kind of person who can’t help doing it.
Slang dictionaries never fail to interest me. A few days ago I ran across one serving the PUA (pick-up artist) subculture, a network of men (and a few women) who have attempted to systematize and explain tactics for picking up women. Chasing links from it, I found a network of blogs and sites describing what they call “game”, which has evolved beyond mere tactics into a generative theory of why the tactics work; indeed in some hands (such as the ferociously intelligent PUA blogger Roissy) it seems to be aspiring to the condition of philosophy.

The Duplicitous Nature of Hamlet In William Shakespeare's,’ Hamlet,’ the protagonist exhibits a puzzling, duplicitous nature. Hamlet contradicts himself throughout the play as he attempts to deal with his internal conflicts. He endorses both the virtues of acting a role and that of being true to one's self. He supports both of these conflicting endorsements with his actions. This ambiguity is demonstrated by his alleged madness, for he does behave madly, only to become...
Frederick Douglass' Dream for Freedom The Civil War was really a war between European-Americans Frederick Douglass' Dream for Equality Abolition stopped Frederick Douglass dead in his tracks and forced him to reinvent himself. He learned the hard central truth about abolition. Once he learned what that truth was, he was compelled to tell it in his speeches and writings even if it meant giving away the most secret truth about himself. From then on, he accepted abolition for what it was...
Julius Ceasar Themes and Plot Development Act I: The play opens humorously with a little word play between Flavius, Marullus, and a few workers. The workers are on their way to see Julius Caesar who has recently returned from his victorious battle against Pompey. The reader immediately sees the dislike the tribunes have towards Caesar and on the other hand, the favor of the commoners. The scene moves to a large gathering where Caesar is the focus. As Caesar converses with Mark Antony, we...
Twelfth Night - Character Study: Malvolio The character Malvolio (meaning literally “I mean ill will) is immediately affected by the implications of his name. His personage is implied directly to be one of negative and somewhat disagreeable nature, which is continued and supported throughout the play, leading to his downfall and mockery which both initially seem to be thoroughly deserved, due to his numerous defects of personality. The first evidence of Malvolio’s undesirable...
Dracula - Easily the best horror novel ever written Bram Stoker's Dracula is, hands down, the greatest horror novel ever written. In addition, it is also an enduring classic of literature. You may have seen every Dracula movie ever made, but you do not know the real Count Dracula until such time as you have read Stoker's book. Of course, unless you have been living under a rock, you will know the general plot line, but I assure you there is a wealth of rich material buried throughout the text...
Death of a Salesman takes place in New York and Boston. The action begins in the home of Willy Loman, an aging salesman who has just returned from a road trip. Willy is having difficulty remembering events, as well as distinguishing the present from his memories of the past. His wife, Linda, suggests that he request a job in New York rather than travel each week. Linda and Willy argue about their oldest son Biff. Biff and his brother, Happy, overhear Willy talking to himself. Biff learns that...
What is a hologram? How a Hologram Works Toss a pebble in a pond -see the ripples? Now drop two pebbles close together. Look at what happens when the two sets of waves combine -you get a new wave! When a crest and a trough meet, they cancel out and the water goes flat. When two crests meet, they produce one, bigger crest. When two troughs collide, they make a single, deeper trough. Believe it or not, you've just found a key to understanding how a hologram works. But what do waves in a pond...
Racial Biases Among Police Officers Recently racial profiling has become a prominent issue in America. After the incident with Rodney King, more emphasis has been placed on profiling. According to news reports, Rodney King was driving down the street in his hometown of L.A. when several police officers stopped him solely of the color of his skin. There are many conflicting information that reports that he was speeding doing about 100 mph before they stopped him. When he was stopped, he...
Recreation of the Eiffel Tower in California Some may ask, “Why should the Eiffel Tower be recreated in California?” A good answer for this is why not? The Eiffel Tower is the one monument that can easily be identified internationally without the usage of words, only a picture of itself. Its beauty attracts around six million visitors each year; however, many Americans are unable to visit due to the fact that it is so far away. If it were recreated in California many more...
The Klan of Terror Over the years many people have created groups to support their beliefs. These groups allow people with the same ideas to gather together and work out plans to advance their ideas. All of the groups that have been established have not necessarily gained a positive image from the public. One example is the Ku Klux Klan. The Ku Klux Klan originated over one hundred years ago and has gone through many eras and changes since its beginning. Although many people know the Ku Klux...
Mexico at its Best Mexican history boasts of long and advanced civilizations that make most European civilizations seem primitive. The first inhabitants were said to have arrived at about 2000B.C. With the Mayan Empire being constructed in about the 12th century. However within the last two centuries Mexico has had relatively little success, consistent victims of imperialist powers the culture has suffered a great deal. The largest blow occurring when America annexed California by force. This...
The NHL Promotes Violence in the League Instead of Hockey During the 2002 Winter Olympics, the hockey games were fast-paced, exciting, and full of tension and well-coordinated offensive plays. And as I was watching these games it readily became apparent to me that the reason the players were focusing entirely on their skill was that none of them were approaching the aggressive type of playing they had during the regular NHL season. Crosschecking against the boards was rare; penalties tended to...
Kathmandu: Its unique sites The capital of the Himalayan kingdom of Nepal is Kathmandu, a beautiful city located in the central part of Nepal. It is situated in a valley and looks magnificent from top of the hills surrounding the city. Also known as the city of gods and goddess, it consists of many cultural heritage sites that make the city unique. Some of them are duly recognized as world heritage sites. Kathmandu Durbar (palace) square, Swayambhu Nath stupa and Pashupati Nath temple are some...
The Muffin or the Mustang It was a normal Saturday morning. Kevin was lying quietly on his bed working on his homework from his Advanced Senior English Class. As he was thinking he took a bite out of his blueberry muffin. Right then he heard a knock at the door. He raced down to the door, and when he opened it, all he found was a note that read: “Meet me at the peak if you want to see it again. From Joe.” As Kevin finished, he heard a loud bang upstairs. He sprinted up to his room...
One of the most little known species of ants in North America is the leaf-cutter ant. This is mainly because it lives in tropical environments and it is not aggressive to animals or humans if not disturbed. The leaf cutting ant is a social insect. Alone the ant is virtually helpless but with the colony it can be a thing feared by animal and human alike. The leaf-cutting ants have a very important role in the tropical forest. They create and manipulate the environment around them. They also can...
How we Develop Stereotypes Someone who dresses in all black may be perceived as a "freak," or be considered different from someone who wears other colors. However, in reality, that person may just be expressing their individuality, or they just simply may like the color. Who are we to judge why this person is wearing the color black? Although we are not qualified to, we still do so. Why? One word-stereotypes. Dressing in black is just one example of how people are stereotyped. ...

Open discussion about ILM and the magic they create. Also VFX and movies in general. Anyone can post topics here.
You know, a lot of people turn their nose up at these movies for just being Tom Cruise stunt reels, but...I don't see that as a bad thing.
So, I watched Roland Emme- I mean, Dean Devlin's Geostorm the other day. Wasn't expecting much, as I knew it was basically going to be "Roland Emmerich lite" in the same way that Pfister's Transcendence was his way of mimicing Nolan and Battleship was Paramount riding on the success of Bay's Transformers.
The movie itself surprised me on a few fronts: it has relatively little environmental destruction (not much of an exaggeration to say that most of the destruction money shots were used in the trailers), and instead was much more of a character-driven story. And the fact that it had a crisp runtime of 1 hour 50 minutes, when compared to the usual 2-2.5 hours that some of these epics have.
As for the VFX, I think it's an even bigger hit-and-miss than Stephen Sommers' movies. You'd think that for a blockbuster producer like Devlin, he'd have enough experience to at least be consistently competent with VFX across the board. Instead, what I found with the work was that the natural environment destruction (tornados, earthquakes, lightning storms, tidal waves) was on par with the kind of CGI you'd expect circa 2008, while any of the outer space/space station work was supber.
Seriously, there's scenes of collapsing buildings and bridges and entirely CG shots of roadways with dozens of cars and it just screamed "G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra Paris Car Chase Sequence". The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, Man of Steel, San Andreas, Independence Day: Resurgence... all had immensely superior city destruction scenes. But with Geostorm, when buildings collapses and broke apart, it legitimately felt like I was watching their pre-viz. The buildings had no weight to them. Skyscrapers were falling to the ground in big chunks and in a matter of 2 seconds, instead of the long, drawn-out collapses that you'd (theoretically, as I have no real-world experience with collapsing buildings, thankfully) see in real life. It was destruction porn, but it wasn't even good destruction porn.
With that said, the outer space scenes that dealt with spaceships and space stations were really, really good looking. Hard-surface work seems to be a popular topic lately, and whichever vendor was responsible for the space station work did a great job (similar to Independence Day: Resurgence's spaceship/space station work, which was also really good).
With that many vendors and it being such a VFX-heavy film, I should take some time to try and find some articles talking about the movie's work.
In all seriousness, though, Geostorm was exactly the kind of movie that would necessitate that many vendors. Lots of isolated sequences of natural disaster destruction, the natural disasters on Earth and the space station in space, lots of green-screen windows and widget elements inside the space station. Wouldn't surprise me if the last half-dozen or so of those vendors worked on only a handful of shots, based on how small their team credits were.
Geostorm sat on the shelf for 3 years they knew immediately it was not going to be possible to craft something watchable out of it. I think its ok but also you can see all the issues with the sloppy editing & disjointed storyline.
Armageddon by far is still the best example of this type of movie done well. I remember Todd did a great piece on the VFX on his own website back in the day....just checked its still up & such a great website as well
MI6 behind the scenes on the practical helicopter FX with Cruise flying looks insane this is going to be an exciting movie no way to fake this in IMAX and they are not even trying to CG it so full marks to Cruise & Paramount for letting him even do his own flying.
Speaking of movies sitting on the shelf...when the heck is Andy Serkis' Tarzan movie going to come out?
And what's interesting is that Tom is actually a licensed and trained pilot. He receives a separate credit in American Made as "Cessna/[other model of aircraft that I can't recall at the moment] Pilot". Like, after all of the cast, right around where the Stunt Coordinator or trained helicopter/aircraft pilots would be, sure enough, "Tom Cruise - Cessna/Aircraft Pilot".
Yes, sorry got my jungle movies mixed up. It is his Jungle Book movie. I know he's been working on that movie for at least the last three or four years. I think he actually shot the movie back before Episode 7 came out. No idea what happened to it.
As far as I know, it's still on track for October of this year. Latest news was a month or so ago where they revealed the title change from Jungle Book: Origins to Mowgli.
Originally it was October of 2016...and then it was bumped to October 2017...and now it's October 2018. It's been delayed longer than most films take to make.
Good grief. Just looked up some production history on it. Serkis was set to direct this back in early 2014, shot it in early 2015.
Haven't seen Pac Rim 2 yet but I am a bit bugged to read a few reviews crediting ILM for the vfx when it was DNeg. Guys, if you know enough to get Legacy Effects involvement right, how do you miss DNeg in the credits?
Finally got around to seeing Black Panther. Not as generic as I thought it was going to be, but also nothing to really write home about. Your usual Marvel schtick: strong opening act or two, weak final act, undercutting every dramatic moment with a joke, hero in a suit fighting a villain in a nigh-identical suit, cap it off with the obligatory "Next Time on Days of Our Marelives...". I will say that I enjoyed Michael B. Jordan as the villain and Shuri and Klaue were the highlights of the movie.
As for the VFX, it had some awesome environment work with the digital cities and such. But did anyone else feel like they had time-travelled back to 2007 and were watching SPI's Spider-Man 3 digital doubles? The digi-double work for Panther or even other characters was just... yikes.
DNeg did some solid work on Pacific Rim: Uprising. Their animation for the Jaegers...is kind of a whole other story due to creative choices by the filmmakers, but there were some AMAZING looking shots of the Jaegers when they were still/standing in the Shatterdome. Some awesome looking hard-surface VFX.
Weta knocked it out of the park again with ape work (this time with no pretentious Andy Serkis quotes!) and had some superb close-ups. Was also nice to see an albino ape instead of the classic dark brown/black colouring.
I'm not sure if maybe Weta swapped out creature work with other companies for certain scenes/shots, because the quality of work in the final battle seemed to fluctuate from A++ to B+. Close-ups were great, wide shots of creatures and city destruction seemed to fall a little short.
Vincent at Artofvfx interviews DNeg's cofounder peter Chiang about supervising the vfx work for Pacific Rim Uprising:
"The art department under Production Designer Stefan Dechant had already worked with the ILM Art Department and had already designed a lot of the Jaegers, Scrapper and the three main Kaiju. VFX came in and finished designing Mega Kaiju, some generic Jaegers, the Drone Kaiju and the breach Kaiju. Once animation and rigging got under way some minor alterations to the original shapes had to be modified."
Started watching this new Netflix show, Altered Carbon, about a month ago. Very good show and vfx done by DNEG TV.
Here's a CARBON piece that talks about the cinematography, with an eye towards some in-camera trickery that also mentions VFX: http://www.studiodaily.com/2018/03/dp-n ... ed-carbon/

Nicole is a coach at CPMFitness. Health and Fitness have been a huge part of her life starting out as a young multiple sport athlete. She is always looking for the next challenge and a way to inspire others. Nicole also brings experience as a licensed physical therapist and when she is not at the gym she is probably coaching soccer or playing the role as a devoted mother and wife.
Jigsaw Puzzles are one of my favorite pastimes. I love to problem solve and find it’s a great way for me to unwind. For many people, 1000 piece puzzles can seem frustrating. Sometimes we get too excited or impatient and try to force pieces in places they don’t belong. We get ahead of ourselves. Frustration sets in because it’s not turning out how we expected it to, only having to start over again.
Does this sound familiar? How many diets or exercise programs have you started only to be disappointed in the end results?
Accountability is a huge part of success even when it comes to nutrition goals. Having someone to answer to, even if that person is yourself can be motivating and will help keep you on track. Food journaling is a great tool to help you do just that.
I have experimented with food journaling over the years and have come to realize that when I am journaling I tend to have greater self-control. There is something about writing down what goes in that makes you stop before you chomp.
Fruits and vegetables contain essential nutrients for a healthy body but what if you don’t like vegetables? Is it possible to eat healthy and attain certain fitness goals without having to “eat the rainbow”?
Whether it’s the taste, texture or just pure hard-headedness, veggies can be a challenge for many. For some the dislike or hatred can turn into a full blown panic attack at the mere sight or thought of a veggie. This really exists it’s called — Lachanophobia. I hope that none of you reading this have this condition as it’s not really what I will be discussing here […] Read more
With summer break upon us, I am filled with mixed emotions. It’s more of a relaxed time. There is less structure and more freedom. Calendars are full of summer activities, camps and family vacations. All of which can throw a major curve ball when it comes to sticking to healthy habits.
For me the key to staying on track is meal prepping. Most of our nights consist of rushing from one activity to the next. Having food ready to eat when hunger hits keeps me from bingeing on snacks or prepackaged convenience food.
“Partner Workout” — What’s your reaction when you see these words on the board? Are you excited? Are you eager to meet somebody new? Or, are you terrified?
Partner workouts can add a lot of fun but for some the feeling of dread takes over which is usually brought on by a fear of letting their partner down. People start comparing themselves to others and out come the apologies. As a coach, I never want a workout to result in someone thinking or feeling they are not good enough.
If you are looking ahead you have probably seen that Turkish Get-ups (TGU) are on the menu to end the week. This is becoming one of my favorite exercises. Why? It’s the one single movement that targets every inch of your body.
The Turkish Get-up incorporates all kinds of ankle, knee and hip movements as well as shoulder stabilization. It’s a great way for anyone to learn how to connect his or her whole body while maintaining a strong core to complete the task.

I have been in a major funk since returning from vacation. Not sure if it’s the lack of Vitamin D, jet lag or time change but I am having a hard time finding my rhythm. I thought vacation was supposed to refresh me. Instead it’s been just the opposite. My energy has been low and self-doubt has begun to sink in. In this industry it’s my job to motivate and encourage others. But how can I do my job if I too need motivation?
As you read my blog this week, I will be enjoying my last few days in the Caribbean. This is something my husband and I commit to doing yearly. Although the finances don’t always look like we can afford to go, we say each year that this is something that we can’t afford not to do.
With the daily hustle and bustle of daily life, it’s easy to forget about the person you married. This is our time to reconnect, spending quality time together away from the kiddos to help us refuel after a long season of busyness.
It’s easy when asked about whom you love, to list our family, friends, pets, crushes, etc. Often we forget to mention a very important person: ourselves.
We live in a tough world. People can be extremely critical, cruel, and cold. We are obsessed with labels, with finding acceptance, with this implication that we must be “perfect.”

I recently entered the world of being a mom of a teenager and I am beginning to see the signs of the entitlement epidemic. We all want the best for our kids. We raise them to be good humans, teaching them right from wrong and how to treat others with respect; but in our loving attempts, have I really fallen into the trap of over-parenting? Am I robbing my kids the opportunity to learn from their mistakes? The world can be a scary place. They will encounter struggle, challenges and difficulties. It’s time for me to take action before it’s […] Read more
During my first six months, my mom described me as a happy baby. I did not cry often, I was a good sleeper and not too picky when it came to food. At 9-months old, I took my first steps. Then one day, instead of walking, I dropped to the floor and could not move. All I would do is cry. The Pediatrician performed a thorough check-up and decided to admit me to hospital due to 104-degree temperature. No explanation was ever provided even after 2-weeks of testing. Then one day I miraculously started to walk again. The next episode […] Read more
I was recently asked to define my risks for 2018. This has been a bit challenging as I realize most of my life has been about playing it safe. I like to stay in one lane. I don’t like a lot of interruption and like to take things at my pace. Taking risks is scary. My mind immediately goes to why would I let myself become so vulnerable?

So the time has finally come for me to get in on the mix of sharing my thoughts with the CPM family. Not going to lie, I put up a good fight. Writing is not my strength but I know that stepping outside of one’s comfort zone is one way for us to grow…so here we go!
I started my journey with CPMFitness during the BAFW in Jan 2014. I was mostly curious about what the rave was all about as I had a few friends that were members. I had no intention of joining a gym. I liked to […] Read more

Allow me to start by beating a dead horse. There is a vital difference between what may in fact be the ideal, perfect monetary system and what are the real monetary changes we are heading straight into today. My purpose for writing this blog is to share with you, and in return to receive your feedback on my own discovery and understanding of the latter. There are plenty of other sites that discuss the former.
If we can discover together where we are heading financially, economically and monetarily, and why we are heading there, then perhaps we can know, in advance, how the understanding of the global consciousness will evolve and unfold in the coming weeks, months and years. And, with this understanding, hopefully we can gain a certain peace of mind with regard to our own financial decisions, positions and future as we head into very stormy waters.
I know from my own experience that a little peace of mind is a priceless asset. It is one worth sharing, and one worth growing. Sharing and growing this asset together with you is my goal. Onward...
Let us quickly run through an assortment of common understandings of the term 'money'. The most common, mainstream understanding of money is that of a device bearing three functions. The three functions are 1) medium of exchange, 2) unit of account and 3) store of value.
A more purist understanding states that money is only a medium of exchange. And that the usability of money in other roles flows from its declared form. For example, if our common medium of exchange is physical gold only, then it is also an excellent store of value.
In fact, as a medium of exchange, money is only one half of a full barter exchange. The other half is when you change your money into that item you desire. But when physical gold is the common medium of exchange, then it is possible that the concept of a "medium" (or middleman) is incorrectly applied, because if gold was what you were after (for its store of value function), then the exchange is completed in only one step! Direct barter!
Finally, there is our new understanding of "the pure concept of money" which is our innate human ability to associate relative values. And within this understanding of 'money', it became clear that in order for our ability to function properly and efficiently in the way it has evolved over millennia, gold must be free for each of us to impute value to it.
Our most recent experiment with gold as the conceptual medium of exchange ended badly. The purist understanding of money, the common medium of exchange, longs for it to be a real commodity, or at least linked to a commodity so that the actual medium can have a relatively stable value and double as a store of wealth. But when we lock a finite commodity into a parity relationship with an inflating paper currency, we only drag down that commodity's relative value compared to the rest of the real world as the related currency is inflated.
Over time, pressure builds up in this relationship set at par, the same as pressure builds between two business partners where one is lazy and unproductive and the other must carry the business through hard work. Sooner or later some of that pressure must be released and parity must be broken. Perhaps the lazy partner's equity position in the business is cut or reduced to reflect his lack of contribution, buying the ill fated relationship a little more time. This is what Roosevelt did with the dollar/gold relationship in 1933. But eventually these mismatched partners will have to part company once and for all. Just as gold and the dollar did in 1971.
In 1971 official parity was broken, but not forgotten. In the years since, an unofficial parity of sorts has been maintained through the paper gold market. Paper gold, like dollars, can be expanded and inflated while being locked at a par with the real thing. This is still going on today. But the pressure has been building for a long time now. This pressure held in the parity relationship between paper and physical gold is about to blow.
Even the gold coin standard we had leading up to the creation of the Federal Reserve System ended badly. You see, people put their gold coins into the banks and the banks lent them out. And then when confidence suffered a shock and the banks faced a run on gold, the system collapsed, many banks failed, and people lost their gold.
Human people want to be able to borrow money in the present that they plan to earn in the future. Not all people want to do this, but enough to influence the system certainly do. And this practice, by its very nature, expands the money supply beyond its physical commodity limits, even in a pure gold coin standard.
During the late nineteenth century, all the major nations of the world moved toward a gold coin standard, wherein the gold coin itself was the common currency and medium of exchange. Between 1873 and 1912 some forty nations used it. [Answers.com]
The following is a post by Randy (@ The Tower) describing the end of the gold coin standard and the dawn of the Federal Reserve System (in blue).
Continuing our investigation into the meaning/essence of "money"... In 1907 America was on the Gold standard and WITHOUT any central bank. Many modern goldbugs might be inclined to yearn for those "good ol’ days" when "money was money and banking was as it should be!"
However, that year is best known by the Panic of 1907 in which the people's economy was plagued by runs on trust companies, banking panics, and a bear market in stocks. Across the nation, banks were unable (and refused) to deliver gold coins and currency to satisfy the requests of depositors for withdrawals of money from their own accounts -- and 246 banks collapsed. It is not difficult to see how the frustration of depositors unable to obtain currency from banks (even solvent ones!) holding their deposits would lead to pressure for political intervention and change.
For a quick exercise in perspective, imagine what you would do today if faced with the same situation in which your bank could not give you any currency ($1s, $5s, $10s, $20s $50 or $100s) to carry away with you as a representation of the money residing in your bank account. No problem. You would simply write a personal check to meet your spending needs, or perhaps ask for a bank draft, or wire the money wherever it needed to go. Amazing! What IS money??? How did you get yours; where did it come from? How do you know what its value is?? Ponder that, and now we return to our glimpse at history...
In the wake of this banking panic, a National Monetary Commission was formed to undertake a scholarly look at the failings of America's financial system. Of these, the four major flaws cited were that the banks were decentralized, clearing methods were inefficient, the huge cash holdings of the federal government were not distributed where most needed, and the currency supply was inelastic. (Please ponder for a moment how or why the CURRENCY supply would ever be an issue if the amount of MONEY found in banks were at a one-to-one ratio with the currency (gold) that represented it. Surely, in this absence of a central bank there couldn't be more money than gold coin! That's impossible!! ) By 1911, the Commission had recommended a plan for a "Reserve Association of America" as the solution to these defects, giving rise two years later to what became our central bank -- The Federal Reserve System. However, that's another story for another time.
Through the coordinated stabilizing actions of three prominent NY bankers to arrest the banking panic [J.P. Morgan, George F. Baker (First National Bank), and James Stillman (National City Bank / Citibank)], their wealth and power was perhaps made more conspicuous in the eyes of the nation than perhaps it would otherwise have been. A prominent Wall Street lawyer named Samuel Untermyer suggested that there was a "Money Trust", and The Wall Street Journal also took notice of affairs and wrote, "So long as Congress will not give us what every other civilized country possesses, a central bank, it forces Wall Street to improvise something of the kind itself."
The House Banking and Currency Committee formed an investigative subcommittee to determine whether a Money Trust existed in NY. The chief counsel was Sam Untermyer, and I think you might gain some insights about the true nature of money from the testimony delivered by Morgan and Baker before the committee in Washington DC at the beginning of 1913.
In questioning Baker about the proposal for banking reform regarding expanded disclosure of bank assets and investments, Untermyer probed, "Why should not the assets, and the detailed assets, be a matter of public knowledge?"
After following a sidetrack in questioning, Untermyer returned to this issue, asking, "Why should the public do business on confidence when it can get the facts?"
To which Baker proclaimed, "Mr. Untermyer, THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF BANKING, perhaps more than some others, is CREDIT." [emphasis added]
It seems that George Baker sensed (rightly?) that the public, familiar with their Currency being a tangible asset (gold coin), would NOT be readily comfortable with the truth about Money. That is to say, that they might struggle to accept the reality that their Money Supply, as represented on the books of the bank, was created by credit, and existed through the grace of confidence. In effect, the tangible Currency had become a mere symbol for the Money (credit) it represented while circulating outside of bank account ledgers.
If you don't care to believe my assessment, I have another point for you. When Untermyer had J.P. Morgan on the witness stand, he asked him, "Is not commercial credit based primarily upon money or property?" [In this exchange, it appears that Untermyer ignorantly used the word "money" as equivalent to gold coin, a usage which Morgan plays similarly until his concluding point about granting CREDIT.]
Untermyer remained obstinate against this notion, as though there were communication difficulties, and pressed again on this point.
Morgan then conclusively stated his conviction on the point that commercial CREDIT is based on character: "Because a man I do not trust could not get MONEY from me on all the bonds in Christendom."
From two eminent bankers who surely knew their business, you now have it that the creation or granting of Money (the extension of Credit) has more to do with the creditworthiness of the borrowers than the collateral that secures against possible default. And recall, these comments occurred while on a gold standard AND in total absence of a government-sponsored central bank -- which was authorized (against Baker's preference) a year later.
As you come to understand how Money and Credit are interrelated, the more you will understand the separate Wealth of gold and why you need it now more than ever.
The point here is that our modern understanding of money, or any money concept for that matter, combined with our modern taste for borrowing, lending and trading of credit and debt, may not NECESSARILY be a perfect fit with a pure gold standard. Even a gold standard, with gold as the actual currency, is manipulated by the banks through confidence-based lending schemes. Sure, a gold standard somewhat limits the collective in its more nefarious pursuits, but it also has flaws that always seem to lead to the same conclusion... failure.
Perhaps it is time for us to consider another alternative, even a natural one that is happening whether we like it or not. How about a new, de facto, free market-driven stasis instead of the old de jure (rigged) false parity relationship... how about Freegold?
At any given moment, a snapshot of our world appears to be only three dimensions; left/right, backwards/forwards, up/down. But with the passage of each and every moment, the world changes. Values change! People change. Everything changes. And all of these changes happen as we move through the fourth dimension, time.
This fourth dimension is very important as we consider the pure concept of money. For it is in this fourth dimension that our pure concept of money resides!
If time was not a factor, then anything accepted as a generic medium of exchange could perfectly perform all the functions commonly linked to the term 'money'. You do your work (somehow without the passage of time) and get paid, and then spend your money on anything within that same moment in which your work's value was judged against the entire universe of real things. A perfect stasis of values would exist everywhere, all at once.
But here in the real world we must be concerned about how far we carry our money through the fourth dimension. Without this vital consideration, we stand to lose everything!
In part 1 of this series I used a diagram I created called The Modern Money Triangle. The three corners of the triangle represented the three primary functions of our modern understanding of money.
But as we pass through the coming phase transition in which the parity between paper gold and physical gold will be broken, cracks will start to form in certain parts of the triangle.
The fractures you see in this diagram are time related. On a short timeline [length of time is the key variable: "t"] fiat currencies will perform our necessary monetary functions, medium of exchange and unit of account. But at some point on the x-axis, 'length of time', we will switch to a different medium, gold.
On a long timeline, gold will perform our necessary monetary functions perfectly, store of value and long term unit of account. By the way, there is no upper limit on the x-axis of 'length of time' when it comes to gold. If plotted out it runs to infinity!
The "x-axis" represents the amount of time you are willing to hang onto the fiat currency you either earn or receive in payment. If the monetary authority is printing money, "t" will be shorter and shorter. In a hyperinflationary situation "t" will slide all the way to the left with a value close to zero. [1]
As the new Freegold system of natural, pristine balance emerges, the fiat monetary authority will find its wisest move is to keep the money supply under control. And with a "wise" CB, gradually the "t" value will shift back to the right, little by little.
The further "t" moves to the right, meaning the longer people are willing to hang on to their fiat, the more investment will flow into new businesses in that currency zone, and the more tax the greedy collective can grab. This is how it will work.
In part 2 of this series I explained that "they" will save the system at any cost. And that this stance presented them with a dilemma. You see, if they don't save the system then "all paper will burn" and gold will "shoot the moon" as the wealth reserve par excellence. But if they DO save the system, "the cost" will be the devaluation of the dollar along with all fiat currencies... and gold will "shoot the moon" as the wealth reserve par excellence.
The phrase "Catch-22" is common idiomatic usage meaning "a no-win situation" or "a double bind" of any type. [Wikipedia] "The catch" in our modern concept of paper wealth is that on one side it is collapsing from its own unsustainable debt service making it, in fact, a non-wealth. But on the other side, if we rescue it from its own un sustainability by guaranteeing or propping up the debt service, we collapse the very denominator of the wealth itself, the currency, and make it a non-wealth. It is a lose-lose situation... a Catch-22!
Do you remember the 1985 movie Wall Street? In it Gordon Gekko liked to buy whole companies through the stock market, shut them down, break them up, and then sell off the pieces. He had figured out that the pieces were more valuable than the whole. Remember in the end of the movie he went after Blue Star Airlines? My, how things have changed in 24 years.
On Friday we learned that Japan Airlines is now completely worthless. Its net worth is now NEGATIVE $8.8 billion!
TOKYO (Reuters) - Liabilities at Japan Airlines Corp (Tokyo:9205.T - News) would exceed its assets by as much as $8.8 billion if Asia's largest airline by revenues were liquidated, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.
The estimate of JAL's negative net worth, calculated by a government-led task force in charge of its restructuring, underscores the depth of the problems facing the airline as it seeks aid from banks and the state to avoid bankruptcy.
Did you know that on Friday people were still buying JAL at a market capitalization price of $3.4 billion even though it was worth [NEGATIVE] -$8.8 billion? One thing I know for sure; Gordon Gekko would NOT have been interested in this one.
Which begs the question, how is the rest of the (publicly traded) economy doing after 24 years of debt accumulation?
This is where the $-debt regime has left us. With empty, hollow shells of corporate entities enslaved to produce revenue only to service their unsustainable debt. What if the owners of JAL decide to leave their vacuous corporate shell behind like a hermit crab abandoning his home, for the greener pastures of a fresh start? That debt hole, the $8.8 billion, is what we hold today as wealth!... inside the financial system! It is gone, not there, if they walk away. Just like an underwater homeowner walking away from his home. If the debt-slave quits, the value illusion is gone!
The entire financial industry today is marked to model, myth, illusion, whatever... just not reality. It is amazing that we even got a story like this, exposing a small portion of the gap between reality and "high finance". JAL is a dead man walking.
At least we are getting some honesty with regard to the real value of JAL. How about the rest of them? How about the banks? Who's debt do YOU hold as wealth? How is THEIR balance sheet doing? Do you have any idea?
Gold is pure equity... no one's debt. No one to walk away. No one to default in bankruptcy. Nothing to liquidate in an attempt to recapture 10 cents on the dollar.
The entire US banking system today is built upon the idea that debt-slaves will continue servicing their debt on millions of underwater houses marked to mythical values at which the loans were established. If you hold your wealth within this freakish system... all I can say is good luck!
The knowledge of the difference between principle and interest must be dead. Everyone is chasing an imaginary yield from entities with negative equity today... with their hard earned principle savings. Can you believe it?
But don't worry about JAL. It won't be quitting. It has been deemed too big to fail! This means that the printing press will guarantee not only its debt-slave service, but its executive bonuses as well (to keep the slaves in the field)!
Next up, the idiotic concept of too big to fail is set to bring down all the imaginary currencies, and with them, the system itself. And once again, gold is not only immune but highly levered in the OPPOSITE direction.
Consider this: You may not fully understand where we are heading. You may be figuring it out at your own pace. But the millions of ungodly fortunes in the world (yes, there are millions of fortunes) don't have that luxury. They must figure it out FAST... or die.
Try to imagine each and every fortune that exists today as a distinct animal. These "fortunes" can be held by individuals, organizations, by funds, or even by sovereign collectives. They can also be held in any number of vessels at this current time. For instance, the Saudis' fortune is largely held underground in oil deposits. Other fortunes are in paper financial products, like your pension fund, and others are already in gold.
As we move forward, the law of nature, the survival of the fittest will come more and more to the forefront. The wholesale creation of new digits is one way that some of the more inbred fortunes are trying to survive. Will it work? Others, with a deeper gene pool, are fleeing to the safety of gold.
Imagine this world of TOO MANY "fortunes" vying for survival in the limited landscape of the real world which is actually too small for them all to survive. The fortunes that have moved entirely into physical gold have already staked out their claim to a specific volume of real estate that is needed to survive in this brutal world. They now own their own territory, a true slice of the real world pie, on which to live and thrive.
Those that are still trying to increase their claim size by inflating paper digits may miss out because the landscape of reality is quickly being bought up by the more clever and observant animals. Survival of the fittest! Those fortunes that make the right moves in these trying times will be the ones to survive and thrive. The rest will die.
These "fortunes" are the giants. Their titanic battle for survival in the limited real world is what will take us where we are going. They need to figure things out quickly if they want to survive. Natural selection will pick the winners and kill off the losers. Today this epic battle nears its climax.
Stake out your own claim today before this final act unfolds. Then spread the word to as many people as possible. This is the best we can do, Lilliputians that we are.
[1] No, the y-axis is nothing but a perpendicular connecting line to a parallel function. I am making a point with the help of visual aids and common understanding. I am not making a mathematical proof. Sorry if I offended any mathematicians with my terminology. :)
"The wholesale creation of new digits is one way that some of the more inbred fortunes are trying to survive."
I read this from Karl Denninger yesterday and almost fell from my seat. So he now changed idea and thinks the dollar will rise:
"If you want to speculate on this outcome levered bets on radical dollar appreciation look like one of the best choices out there"
How can this be? I dont get it and kindly ask for this community's help to understand this. What in the world made him change, and does it make sense?
Gold's rise is largely financed by the dollar carry trade. Gold is rising on borrowed money that is.
"Thing is," as a professional wholesale dealer here in London's bullion market told me today, "the ETFs still don't show any signs of shrinking when the price takes a dip. They're as sticky as ever. But no, overall, physical flows at the moment are nowhere as strong as they were. The action's very much in the futures."
Here's what I don't understand: if you peg the USD to gold, then the only way to expand the monetary supply is to buy more gold. Population growth alone should dictate that either the monetary supply should expand, or that deflation should occur, given there's the same amount of currency in circulation for more people. Or one could adjust the peg, but this is also deflationary or at least introduces a sudden shock into the market.
Not sure if this is in line with your query, but check out FOFOA's short discussion of deflation and a gold standard here - http://tinyurl.com/m2x7rd
Imagine a hypothetical perfect gold standard. There is nothing but gold used as money, and its supply remains constant. As man labors and builds, the economy will grow, and gradually one piece of gold will equal more and more real goods and services. Over time, in this perfect gold standard, the value of that piece of gold will rise and the cost of goods and services will fall.
Now imagine a lender and borrower. The lender lends 10 ounces of gold to the borrower, who then trades it on the open market for the goods he needs to be productive, say, farm equipment.
Let's say the term is a 5 year loan and there is no interest in this perfect world. After 5 years, the borrower must return the 10 ounces of gold that he borrowed.
During those 5 years, the value of gold will rise and prices of goods will fall, what we currently think of as "deflation". So in 5 years when the farmer must reacquire gold on the open market, he will have to surrender more goods than he received for that same gold 5 years earlier. Likewise, the lender will receive his gold back with greater purchasing power than it had 5 years earlier.
In essence, the lender received "interest" and the borrower paid "interest", even though the money supply remained the same. All that changed was the economy against which the money is measured! The interest was the productivity that the borrower added to the economy. The lender profited from this economic growth and the borrower labored to meet his obligation.
So in this perfect world, the price of borrowing money means keeping up with the average productivity of everyone else in a growing economy.
In other words, money is priced in goods and labor. The price of money is goods or labor. You must either create them or surrender them for money.
It seems that article suggests that use of leverage/easy money to purchase gold futures and drive up the gold price might not represent a sustainable move, and thus another asset deflationary shock might cause these firms to liquidate their leveraged positions to meet capital calls, thus collapsing the price of gold (at least the price of paper gold).
Is there a different angle than this to take from that article, or a better way to view this phenomena?
The dollar is the carrytrade. Indicators also show that the dollar is drastically oversold. That means that basically the whole market is speculating on a drastic slide in the dollar. Generally that is a rather good indicator that the market will turn in order to meet its average. No guarantees, but we might see a short squeeze in the dollar soon, that is basically what he is saying.
A shortsqueeze in the dollar would mean that everyone starts selling (paper) assets in order to obtain the dollar. Hence stocks, CDOs and everything will fall and the dollar will rise.
As this would trigger massive panic, it is unclear what gold would do. As most gold owners are in the game to protect their wealth they might hang on to their gold, and gold may rise.
However, lately some speculative money has been using dollar lending to buy gold. They might be forced to liquidate, which would be less good for the gold price.
@Anon: I am having a hard time understanding how a gold-backed currency could work out in the long run.
However, a next deflationary shock - caused by increased dollar desire and massive asset sell-offs to feed that hunger - will also trigger a panic. That might drive cash money to physical gold.
So perhaps such a scenario might drive people out of the paper gold market and into the physical one. As gold prices are currently set on the paper markets gold in dollars might decline, although I wouldn't bet on that as we might really see panic bigger than the Lehman collapse.
It really can't and the smart ones are not advocating that we return to a gold standard. A gold standard also opens up a country to foreign manipulation.
Oh, and "Allen" I don't know how you can say that our current standard doesn't open us up to foreign manipulation. There's going to be manipulation no matter what the standard is. Right now China has a huge roll of dollars and that is manipulating the markets and policy. They are also bulking up on gold too, for what kind of manipulation I don't fully know.
I think the desire for a gold back currency is that there is a recognition that currency should be based on something tangible. Fiat currencies are based on something that is terribly hard to quantify and often feels like so much smoke and mirrors.
I think gold will stay relatively flat against the dollar (plus or minus 10 percent) when the next big stock market drop comes. The number of people who have figured it out, and run to gold will be balanced out by those who haven't, and run to the dollar. After that, once the public sees gold as one of the few things holding strong, the real run will begin. Assuming the drop comes fairly soon. The longer it takes the less likely gold will fall at all as dollar confidence slowly grinds down.
FOFOA; As an animal lover, I find the metaphor of your first sentence jarring and offensive. Would you agree to using the formulation "flogging a dead bankster" instead? Far more satisfying, methinks.
You have now made the case for sound money resoundingly. Those who profess confusion at this late hour are beyond help. Many questioners would do well to spend a few hours perusing your archives.
Could you give an outline of how the transition from $$ and other fiats will progress? Obviously non-linear, but what is your best model hypothesis for how this will actually unfold? Thanks FOFOA.
I understand how backing dollars to gold helps try to keep inflation in check, but going back to a gold standard is NOT the answer. For more in detail on this, you can read the book "The Lost Science of Money". The answer to the problem is to take money creation powers away from private banking. End or Nationalize the FED and prohibit fractional reserve banking.
Think about it. The FED trying to control the money supply by adjusting interest rates is like driving a car from the back seat. Fiat money creation should be a matter of "Law".
How is money currently created???? Money is created by being loaned into existence by private banks. The money supply is this country is controlled by private BANKS! And the biggest of the bunch is the Federal Reserve which is also a PRIVATE BANK. Now, one can ask who should control the supply of money - private or public entities? Why isn’t our money supply controlled by the government? The reason is that our constitution (and founding fathers) really didn’t address the MONEY power and because of this, the money power was and still is controlled by powerful, private banks. Is this a good idea? Is this a stable environment? I believe both of the questions have been answered, but to provide some more doubt, let’s compare money creation with the military. Let’s say the military was setup in a similar fashion where thousands of private armies (like banks) all competed for revenue and profit. Could you image the chaos? Would this ever work? How is it then, something as vital (money) as national security, be controlled by private entities?
FOFOA, you should clearly mention somewhere that your blog is not about the return of the gold-backed currency.
So that there is no confusion when somebody visit your blog for the first time. Especially when the article says "Gold is money", ppl immediately associate this with gold-standard ;)
I try to believe; I really do. I've even acted on some of the advice here and elsewhere and bought some gold. However, I just can't go all in, as they say, inasmuch as it appears to me to require a leap of faith. The future is unknowable. If we do experience deflation and/or a hyperinflationary fiat currency event, who knows what the elites will attempt. I hope what FOFOA posits will be the ultimate outcome, but it seems to me less than a lock. Therefore, while I have hedged a little in favor of a rising gold price, I still feel too much like Mulder.
This crisis is, and always has been, a systemic crisis, meaning the entire system is unstable and could catastrophically collapse at any time. If the signs that Karl is seeing are real, then they pose a serious threat to the entire financial system, not just a dollar rally and no available credit. Karl says the Fed is aware this is a solvency problem. This means there are a whole bunch of Japan Airlines out there, especially on Wall Street!
Remember from my post that there is short term money, and long term money "storage". Short term money is operational money. It is the money companies need for daily operation and debtors (and banks) need for their debt service. This is the stream of funds that will disappear in a credit market dislocation like Karl sees.
The result will be the failure of the paper wealth that is based on the debt-slaves that will be cut off from their stream of credit. The yield stream will vanish and savers will look to their principle and find that it is gone too. This will cause a flight of capital out of the long term money "storage" vehicles. And then the whole system will collapse.
The Fed will do literally anything to keep this from happening. As I said, they will save the system at ANY cost. This could mean any number of things, including things we haven't even considered yet. But most likely it will mean buying more junk from the banks with printed funds. The Fed will do what it did last year and print up another trillion or two and swap it for whatever toxic waste the banks still have, injecting massive liquidity into the system.
The US creditors will see this and know what is going on, and the T-bond market will suffer. The Fed will also cover that problem. It is a vicious cycle.
Denninger's prediction of a spike in the dollar is for short term traders. It has nothing to do with any fundamental strength. In fact, it could end up being the final pass-through for the dollar if things go badly enough. I certainly wouldn't trade it except for with funds you are willing to lose. Remember that the real leverage is in the final move that physical gold will make. The biggest profits will come to those who sit and wait.
As the parity between paper gold and physical gold breaks we will see the paper price of gold go down. I have no idea if that will happen here or at $2,000 or $3,000 or $10,000. But at some point the price of paper gold will reflect the price of the paper, not the gold.
So if I saw the dollar shooting sky high and gold crashing, I would wonder if this might be happening now. I would wonder if Exter's inverse pyramid was collapsing before my very eyes, as panicked funds exit massive positions trying to pass through the bottleneck of the transactional money supply and get into physical only. Of course much of it will be trapped in the dollar until the physical price of gold resets MUCH higher.
Just some things to consider when you hear stories of potential systemic failure and the writer suggests going long the dollar and short commodities (gold?). A spike in the dollar may just be its death knell. We are approaching the end of Jim Sinclair's countdown that was based on external dollar forces. Karl is looking at the internal problems. I'm sure Sinclair's external friends are as well!
Freegold is NOT a new gold standard. Gold is NOT money the way we think of money. Gold is a valuable item to store, as Gary North says. Gold is THE wealth reserve par excellence. Gold will replace Wall Street, not the dollar. We will still have fiat currencies! Gold's wealth function will act as the counterbalance against the fiat currencies, as a true representation of the real world wealth against which they are priced.
Raptor, isn't it amazing how some people get more from the title than they do from the body of an article?
But in fact, each person is probably getting what they need to get from it at that time. Hopefully it is good enough that they will come back like you did. If it is not, then I need to do a better job. It is impossible to distribute all information in one post. You reach a point of diminishing returns if you try to pack too much into one piece.
My best advice is not to go "all in", unless that is your level of understanding and confidence. Obviously in your case it is not. My best advice is to only put as much into physical gold as you are comfortable with. A percentage that matches your understanding of gold. For some people that is 20%. For others it is 100%.
As long as you put in more than 10% you will probably preserve and even increase your purchasing power! :)
If the horse is already dead, what is the harm in beating it? And in your scenario, what good does the flogging do?
I don't think we will see an end to fiat currencies or even to the dollar. We may see the end of the dollar through hyperinflation, but even a severely devalued currency can still survive. Look at the peso! The transition I see lies mainly in the way savers and net producers will store their excess wealth. They will transition from debt-based storage to equity-based storage, primarily gold. This will remove the ability of the hungry collective to surreptitiously steal from the savers and producers. This will also remove the ability of the US to live above its means. It will force the world into a new meritocracy.
The story on a dollar rally and collapse of the system is a possible scenario indeed. However, as Fofoa says, the Fed will do anything to protect the system. Therefore I do not deem it very likely that the collapse Denninger is predicting will totally crash the system yet. I will turn loose some more screws, but not crash it yet I guess.
Going long the dollar and short gold might indeed turn out to be a profitable strategy, but as Fofoa indicates, it is also a very risky one, as it is not assured the system will survive.
And I hope the dollar goes up and gold down like Denninger says. Because I will short the dollar to the depths of Hades and buy Gold as it finds a bottom.
Do you people realize how evil this system is? Do you not realize this system hurts the weakest people of our societies? The people on fixed incomes- widows, orphans, single mothers, and the elderly.
Today I saw a program on Russia on TV. It picture a Russian millionaire that ran for the presidency in the past and is now trying to set up a gold coin system from Moscow. According to him Russian civilians were trained like Olympic athletes on withstanding crises, and introducing gold money was the best thing he could do for the people and himself.
I would recommend like FOFOA said at least 10% of your FREE money (you would have to have at least 3-8 months cash to live, all the time, depending on your situation).
One options is if you are not totally sure we will get a full collapse - go the paper route, but not with GLD and SLV ... but instead into CEF and/or GTU plus may be bullionvalut.com, and some mining companies .. Why ?
But here is one big IF.... at the moment you see the-BIG-panic in the market you should be READY on the sell button.. ;) .. and sell even if you expect the physical to skyrocket even more.
What do you achieve with this : you are not totally locked in physical (that is IF you are not 100% sure in FOFOA predictions). You wont preserve all of your purchasing power, but at least you will preserve some..
That is not investment advice...but my idea how you can HEDGE! (mind you this differs from SAVE ) if we don't get totally "black/white" event but "grey" event..
Also another good hedge is if you buy a house with mortgage which you have NO PROBLEMS paying over time and can wait at least 5-7 years. Which is to say you would live there ;)
House is good hedge cause it lowers your tax burden too, esp. if we morph to high inflation environment for longer period of time...
PS> In my country in 1992 we had 200% inflation in a matter of month and I preserved my purchasing power by accident cause I had my money 50% in dollars and 50% in our own currency...
but back then I was clueless about all this economic mumbo-jumbo :), my point is if you don't know what to do trust your COMMON SENSE.. and know money history ;)
I would love for you to elaborate on WHEN we will hit the FAN for sure. Probably like back on the envelope calculation. Having the following USA data :
I'm in opinion that the real crisis will be triggered by external credit event... i.e. the foreigners will slow..then stop.. then sell the debt.
Then as a side fact I'm also aware of the possibility that the foreigners may stop buying ty's just because they don't have enough savings anymore and they would like better to spend those money in their respective countries.
I'm also aware that in the last couple of months foreigners have become found of the idea of diversifying themselves...
The problems is that it is very hard to quantify all those thoughts, so I can get some idea of the timing of the events to come.
Dollar as measured by Weighted-Fed-USD index or USDX dropping more than 50% in a year is another good indicator.
I don't do technical analysis and I don't do timings. But I can tell you that what is coming will defy all TA when it happens. It won't fit the predictions and it will surprise everyone. And I will be surprised if it is not sooner rather than later.
What is coming will be a sort of a "bank run" on value held within the system. Everyone will try to withdraw their "value" all at once. But value in the financial system exists only in fractional reserve, and the fraction is shrinking every day.
I don't know who will start the run, but there are many possibilities. It will be a psychologically driven event. Calculations won't mean anything. We are already far enough along for psychology to take over.
Thanks FOFOA and raptor for the responses -- I'm probably like you in the 90's, raptor, in that I'm sort of where you suggest, although not as a result of careful planning but rather some luck and natural conservatism in financial matters. I have a mortgage I can well afford if my income stays relatively constant and I have some PM's, about half of the value of which is in silver. I'd like to get out of that and into gold at some opportune time. The cash "savings" I have are what worry me in that I think they might go poof in the night. Oh well, such is the risk of being indecisive.
In this evolution we return to what was always in the system. The 'natural selection' of the fiat money system will return to it's earliest roots. Nothing new will have been created, just all the illusions, pretentions and delusions will be revealed for what they always were! There will not even be a smoking ruin as smoke can only be created by burning something that physically existed in the first place. The ultimate effect will be like the turning off of a hologram image projected into a vacumn.
Michael S. Rozeff has an interesting article/model on Lewrockwell.com talking about putting a dollar price on gold related to the posts on here. He draws a line from gold, to currency and reserves (monetary base), to 'money' created by banks (through loans), to good loans and bad loans (how much of the bank money actually has real world value behind it).
...Applied to the central bank whose only asset is gold and whose liabilities are currency and bank reserves, the ZDV is a value for gold such that every outstanding dollar liability in the central bank’s monetary base (currency plus bank reserves) is backed by an equivalent dollar’s worth of gold. It is what the dollar price of gold would be if the central bank’s liabilities were 100 percent backed or covered by gold...
The central bank has Assets of gold, or G, which is a certain number of ounces of gold. Its liabilities are Currency of 1 and Reserves of 1. The Reserves are the deposits of the banks. This fifty-fifty split between currency and reserves is roughly the current situation at the FED. The ZDV of the central bank is (R + C )/G = (1 + 1)/G = 2/G. With gold later to be taken as 261.5 million ounces and the bank’s numbers expressed in trillions, the central bank’s ZDV is $2 trillion/261.5 million oz. = $7,648 per oz. This is actually quite close to the FED’s ZDV at present, which I estimate to be $7,456...
Bad loans are loans that fail to provide the full amount of the promised payments. Any losses in value of bad loans below the promised payments mean that borrowers have not collected enough dollars from their customers or jobs to write checks to the banks and reduce deposits. The dollars remain in the system as deposits. How so? If a borrower has bought a house on a mortgage loan that he cannot repay, he has written a check to the house’s owner. That seller then has those funds on deposit in his account. They will only be offset when the borrower pays off the bank loan. If he is unable to do this, then bank deposits or bank money do not shrink. But since the bad loan has reduced or no market worth, we see that bad loans reduce the loan backing of the still outstanding dollar deposits that were created against them...
For what it's worth - just putting it out there - a couple of weeks ago I commented on the correlation between Legatus meetings and tops in equities. Well, the pattern appears to have held. The meeting was over on October 19 and market peak was on the 20th. I find the correlation interesting and a bit unnerving. As far as equities bottoming out, and total heck truly beginning, I believe Martin Armstrong has mentioned April or May 2010. It is my staunch belief that Fofoa is correct in the medium/long term and that's all that really matters - the other stuff is just speculation.
Do you remember in the not too distant past that the ECB said to not use Euro’s for the oil trade? They stated something to the effect, there simply wasn’t enough and it would drive demand so much as to create too strong a currency?
Fast forward to today where our fearless leader (http://jsmineset.com/) links to the Iranian Oil Bourse news (http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidZAWYA20091027060706/Iran:%20Oil%20bourse%20inaugurated). If you read closely they will trade “… in various currencies, primarily the euro and Iranian rial, and a basket of other major currencies.” And, from the letter they sent to Japanese oil refiners, we know they are currently trading in Yen.
Have to wonder how close we are to the point where the strength of other currencies – through usage demand – will level the dollar’s playing field?
It has been predicted that key strength for the euro will come from oil backing. The Yen has been strengthening with a little oil backing. To some, the Euro seems overvalued, but maybe this will add a little more strength.
"The dollar is already dead, it's just everyone in the world is trying to figure out how to unwind their positions without creating panic. It's a big house of cards with everyone who understands whats really goin on trying to slowly pull their cards out. One day someone is going to pull too hard too quick and things will get very interesting."
"While gamblers can continue to use GLD-NYSE for trading purposes, those who are using GLD to buy and hold gold as a replacement for physical gold, in my view, are making a major error and quite possibly a fatal one."
"This is the real deal. This is not 1979, the era of greed. This is the era of fear. Panic and rash action will not help you.

"Get Out of Bonds -- Fast!... Individual investors have pumped record amounts of cash into bond mutual funds this year, just like they did in stock funds in 1999. I believe that with the first rumor of a failed Treasury auction, investors will finally flee bonds in droves. The monthly record supply of bonds and the coming decline in demand is all that's needed to spell disaster for the bond market... Mr. Bernanke is going to have to make a decision soon between sacrificing the stock market or the bond market." (Minyanville)

We need to keep a few principles in mind in order to understand what is being discussed in these confusing discussions about a liquidity crisis, currency swaps, and supposed dollar strength. My apologies if I simplify this too much for your taste, but my thoughts are simple ones...
2) Drastic currency devaluations coincide with a multiplication of the monetary base, not the credit expansion of wider monetary measurements.
3) The USDX measures the supply and demand of actual base money needed for transaction clearing, not the willingness of banks to stick their necks out further. Base money is the "reserve" in the term "fractional reserve banking". We could call it "fractional base money banking".
5) There is no difference between the $ and the $-financial industry ($-FI). What is bad for one is bad for the other. A run on the system is just as bad as a run on the banks, or a run on the dollar. Any run screws them all.
6) Much of what we all think of as money (dollars) is not really dollars in the same sense as the dollars needed in a liquidity crisis. We think of money mostly as M2. But a liquidity crisis requires MB (Monetary Base, or base money)
7) "The system", meaning the worldwide financial industry is divided into sub-systems; The Federal Reserve system, the Eurozone system, the British system, etc... What differentiates these sub-systems from one another is their own currency, which can be created on a whim by the central bank and lent to banks that need extra funds with the CB taking collateral from the borrowing bank in the form of assets denominated in that currency.
8) Each sub-system is a completely interconnected network of financial institutions, including commercial banks, investment banks, brokerages, etc... 99% of all transactions within each sub-system clear without ever having to move money (dollars). For example, within the bigger banks, most transactions clear in-house. One person might buy a house, taking out a new loan for $100,000 while some other bank customer sells his house paying off his $100,000 loan. These two transactions cancel each other out in-house. Inter-bank transactions cancel each other out as well. For the most part, finance and banking is a zero-sum game within each sub-system, from stock transactions to bond transactions to new loans to settled loans to you writing a check to your dentist. If one bank ends up with more at the end of the day and another with less, then the central bank clears the trade with a book entry transferring "reserves" from one bank to the other. Even new loans do not really create the kind of money that is needed in a liquidity crisis. They create credits issued by the bank, liabilities that are counterbalanced by the debt papers you signed. Those credits entitle to bearer to dip into the bank's actual dollar reserves, but do not create new dollars. The only new dollars that get created are when the bank must move funds to cover fractional reserve requirements. Those funds then become new monetary base. THOSE are the kinds of dollars needed in a liquidity crisis.
9) Each sub-system has a TREMENDOUS amount of flexibility since the CB acts as the ultimate clearing house between all the financial institutions in that sub-system. And since we are now on a purely symbolic fiat currency, the CB can create any liquidity the system needs. If one bank comes up so short at the end of the day, owing another bank more reserves than it has, then the CB just creates new reserves and lends them to the bank that is short and the CB takes assets (from the borrowing bank) onto its own balance sheet to counterbalance and collateralize the loan of fresh new money. This flexibility has virtually eliminated all banking liquidity problems within any given sub-system. Only an actual bank run on physical cash within a sub-system presents a real threat. And if that run happens to only one bank in that sub-system, then that bank is sacrificed. If a sub-system-wide run on cash were to happen, we would have a bank holiday while they figured out the best way to devalue the monetary base and increase it.
10) Viewing the whole worldwide financial system, in which the BIS acts as the ultimate clearing house, there is much less flexibility because the BIS does not print the currencies it clears. The BIS would prefer ITS central clearing to be done in gold bullion, stored in its vaults and moved from one countries slot to another when necessary. But the $-system doesn't want to play that game. Even still, 99% of the worldwide transactions clear without the need to transfer any funds around... as long as it is a "business as usual" day.
11) Problems start to arise in the international clearing house when daily transactions become unbalanced, meaning too many people trying to do the same thing all at once, with no one willing to do the opposite thing. The two sides of a zero-sum game are never in perfect balance, but they are usually close enough that market pricing takes care of the difference. (If there are too many sellers then the price drops until the sellers equal the buyers.) But sometimes an event happens that spooks the markets and sends everyone to one side of a trade all at once. Prices go into free fall which spooks the markets even more. Then the exchanges are shut down "to let cooler heads prevail". But this only spooks the market further. Finally, at the end of the day, the clearing house is left with a big one-sided mess to clean up.
12) Here is the big problem. Each of these sub-systems has its own currency which its CB can print at will... flexibility! But with the dollar being the global reserve currency, there are lots and lots of dollar-denominated assets held by financial institutions in many non-$ sub-systems. So when there is turmoil in the dollar-denominated markets, the non-dollar sub-systems run into a clearing problem because they can't print dollars to help banks that owe other banks more dollars than they have. So they turn to the BIS, who also can't print dollars. Only the Fed can. So the Fed ends up being the de facto CB to the world. But it is not the clearing house for the world, and it does not take assets onto its books from those foreign banks that got into trouble. Instead, it lends directly to the other CB's which print some of their own new currency and send it to the Fed in exchange. This is why it is called a "swap" instead of Quantitative Easing. They are swapping freshly printed currencies instead of assets for currencies. All base money! The same as cash. TWICE as potentially inflationary as QE on a global scale because two sides are now exposed to currency risk.
13) When the Fed makes these international currency swaps, it doesn't send pallets of hundred dollar bills on a plane. It simply makes a contract with the foreign CB and a book entry. The contract is a two-way promise to later provide pallets of physical cash if anything goes wrong and cash is needed. And with this promise in hand, the foreign CB makes a similar contract (promise) with the European bank that got in trouble. The foreign CB promises to later provide physical cash if necessary (if something goes wrong), and the bank submits assets to the CB as collateral. Next the troubled bank passes those dollar promises (IOUs) on to the bank it owes the dollars to and that bank credits its customer's account with dollars it doesn't have, but now has indirect access to (if needed). The idea is that as things return to normal and transactions start clearing in a more balanced state that ultimately the dollars that were needed will be able to be gotten on the open market without causing a spike in the price and they can work their way back to the foreign CB. The troubled bank, for example, can later trade assets for dollars and pay back the foreign CB which will then pass those physical dollars on to the bank holding the IOU. And now that the European problem has been cleared, the foreign CB can cancel that portion of the two-way swap agreement with the Fed. And no physical dollars need cross the ocean. And that portion of the currency risk is eliminated.
14) Base money is either physical cash or a liability (IOU) that traces directly back to the Fed, which includes reserves held at the Fed. In other words, it is physical cash, or the promise of physical cash from he who can print physical cash. The Fed is willing to issue these promises willy nilly but hopes it doesn't actually end up having to do the printing.
15) The USDX is a measure of dollar exchanges with other currencies that happen on the open market. The Fed can counteract a rise in open market dollar demand by providing a supply of dollars directly to banks within its own sub-system, or indirectly to foreign banks through swaps with other CB's. Last year the Fed had a lot of practice doing this fast. I am sure the contractual transaction with the foreign CB's took several hours and included recording video teleconferences in which the agreements were legally bound. But now that they have experience doing this in a crisis, next time it will probably be almost instantaneous.
16) So as long as there is more demand for dollars than supply, the Fed can control the price of the dollar on the USDX by its own willingness to lend dollars at zero interest with toxic assets or foreign currency as collateral. This costs the Fed nothing, except currency risk and bad PR at blogs like mine. But where the Fed loses control is when there is more supply than demand. And that is what is coming because of this very inflationary policy of providing dollars to save the system at any cost.
17) The problem is with the assets that are being swapped around for dollars, whether with the Fed or with the foreign CB's. These assets are becoming less and less liquid because they are not valued correctly. If they were valued correctly, the banks would be insolvent and have to file bankruptcy. They wouldn't even have enough assets to settle their debts by swapping with the CB's. This is why the assets need to remain marked to myth. But this makes the assets only sellable to the CB's. The open market doesn't want them. So the clearing mechanism that is needed to reverse the flow of supposedly temporary base money into the system is breaking down. The Fed tells us with a straight face that it can reverse everything it has done so far. But that is only the case if the free, open market is willing to take up all the slack the Fed put out there by private investors buying toxic assets at marked to model prices.
18) So the next time the Fed has to create a trillion new dollars of liquidity, it is likely going to stick in the system as base money that cannot be removed. Ultimately the Fed will be contractually obligated to print actual bills and supply them to the banks and CB's that hold the contract for them. And this is what devalues the dollar.
Conclusions: The USDX is a rather poor metric by which to judge the dollar, even in the short term. As long as there is a demand for base dollars, like there is in a panic or a crisis, the Fed has total control over whether it wants to let that demand bid the dollars on the open market, or provide them itself. And the Fed cares more about the financial system than the value of the dollar, so it will surely provide any liquidity that is needed.
The next crisis, if it is mainly in the US financial system, will likely not spike the dollar because the Fed has total control and flexibility within its own system. If it is spread throughout the world it may spike as foreign banks bid up dollars on the exchange, but the Fed is now more experienced than it was a year ago and will likely put a lid on it very quickly.
But this next dollar shock will probably be irreversible, unlike the last. And in such, it will increase the global supply of dollar monetary base by a large percent. Perhaps by 100% or more. This alone will devalue the dollar and be the cause of the next shock which will require a similar response by the Fed, perhaps increasing the base by another 50% as China and others dump the last of their bonds onto the open market in a highly one-sided transaction sending the value of the bonds to zero, US interest rates to something so high they are non-existent, and the purchasing power of the dollar down into the stinky, Zimbabwe dirt.
So in short, I guess I agree with David Bloom. Of course it COULD rally, but I don't think the Fed will let it (unless it happens to have some T-bonds to sell that week!). Letting it rally too high would crush the financial system (by driving asset values into the dirt) which the Fed wants to save at any cost. Even though the cost will be the crushing of the system. The ol' Catch-22.
Sorry if this seemed a bit simplistic or a little elementary. Of course there are more complicated issues involved, like the $ carry trade and cross-currency investments. Derived foreign exchange activities become very complicated very fast! Too complicated for the banks, obviously! But I hope I at least covered the basics of the problem, enough to explain my answer. You all will be sure to let me know if I got something wrong... I am sure of that! ;)
PS. This is the big secret that George F. Baker didn't want to tell Congress in 1913. That most all of what we think is money is really just promises issued by banks to supposedly credit-worthy entities giving them the right to withdraw value from a small reserve of actual money, but at the same time praying to God that they don't! It's like saying, "here you go, it's all your's, whenever you want it come and get it" with their fingers crossed behind their backs hoping you won't ever actually "come and get it".
But whatever happens in the short term, the USDX will ultimately collapse just as Jim Sinclair says because ultimately is DOES represent a preference of currencies for use in international trade. And we know where that is heading, especially while the Fed hyperinflates the MB trying to save its own precious global $-FI!
2) Hyperinflation coincide with a multiplication of the monetary base (which is the natural CB response to the panicked marketplace devaluing the "broad money" which is actually near-cash credit assets), not from the credit expansion of the broader monetary measurements by commercial banks.
FOFOA, Could you please turn these wonderful last replies into a post? They clear up yet another whole lot rubbish (this time about "dollar demand") that simply did not make sense in anything else I have read. It is difficult to send the comments link to my friends who should read it.
ps. Do not apologize for being "a bit simplistic or a little elementary". It is never simple to express yourself with such clarity.
fofoa - check out the post on ZH re M2 here vs. EC with the implications on M3 reporting and the liklihood that the ECB will eventually have to debase. In effect the argument is that the CBs are sequencing devalueation to support bond auctions etc.
Spot on analysis: the problem is that the equilibrium GDP is more like 9T (maybe lower) vs. the $15T reported. As such printing money serves only to support the bubble like asset valuations which in turn supports the bank asset balance sheets (loans) not to mention their securities portfolios. Indeed, the I have neveer seen an analysis of that the systemic cost owuld be of taking out the big banks and carving them down both to bondholders, depositors , jutual funds and insurance ocmplex (pensions). Whatever it is, the cost is substantial and justifes the printing regime to play make believe. Of course this leaves aside the draconian geopoltiical implications of having the robe pulled back. The single greatest tell for in this past few months was the report that France was part of that anti dollar axis of evil. The French invented realpolitik.
I'd be interested in your thoughts on the M2 - M3 debate and the ECB catchup. I think you are correct that the rest of the world is biding their time before moving off the standard. The notion that germany is issuing in dollars says something loud and clear. A bundesbank that is notoriously conservative?/hawkish?
1) Tyler says that money market funds are M3 in both Europe and the US. But actually, money market funds owned by individuals are counted as part of M2 in the US. These are most definitely not money. They are assets which is how they can, in a crisis, "break the buck".
Fed --> "M2 consists of... balances in retail money market mutual funds, less IRA and Keogh balances at money market mutual funds."
2) Tyler asks: "This begs the question: does Europe anticipate not having budget deficits of the same magnitude as America?" I would remind you of Wim Duisenberg's famous speech about the Euro... "The euro, probably more than any other currency, represents the mutual confidence at the heart of our community. It is the first currency that has not only severed its link to gold, but also its link to the nation-state. It is not backed by the durability of the metal or by the authority of the state."
NATION-STATE - This is the difference between the Euro and the Dollar. The US uses its currency to fund its massive deficits. The Euro was not set up this way! The Euro is a shared community currency.
3) The ECB faces a tug of war between its various powerful members regarding monetary policy. In this way it is nothing like the Fed. Trichet is a lot more like Bernanke than the Germans would prefer, but still he must play the Euro game which is not the same.
The FDIC is closing banks because they are insolvent. This is actually a systemic problem as so much of the asset base is built upon the housing and commercial real estate sectors. But the bigger banks are being protected by accounting rules that let them lie about the value of their complex derivatives.
The smaller banks still hold a lot of raw mortgages they issued... not yet securitized. These are harder to lie about. Many banks are lying by not foreclosing even on badly delinquent homeowners. But this is only making the problem worse and "kicking the can down the road".
These smaller banks don't have the assets to acquire the loans they need to cover their liabilities. They are insolvent, just like the big banks, but they can't hide it anymore, thus they get closed.
This is what people mean when they say, "this is not a liquidity crisis, it is an insolvency crisis". "Liquidity" means being able to get money for your assets from the CB (or from the open market). "Insolvency" means you don't even have the asset values to do that! I should have addressed this too, but my comment was so long and it was so late when I was writing it.
I will think about making this into a post. Thank you for your nice comment! Did you know there are permalinks to comments as well? Here is the one to my comment ---> Dollar liquidity
Wouldn't it be great if they just did away with all legal tender laws? Perhaps they could just keep one stating how they want you to pay your taxes. But let the courts defend any and all contractual agreements no matter what they are denominated in. And open the mint to free coinage! Of course this is all part of the world that SHOULD be, not the one that WILL be. So it doesn't give us much guidance for preserving (and increasing) the purchasing power we have NOW.
Isn't it interesting that the legal tender laws came out in 1909, just two years after the panic of 1907? As Fekete says, they led to the governmental ability to finance the world wars. But is legal tender really the problem? Or is it that the people continued to confuse the store of value function with the other monetary functions? If we now return back to the system of 1906, are we not returning to a system that has already reached a less than ideal end several times? Perhaps it would be better to embrace the separation of monetary functions as this will take away the ability to finance wars the same as a new gold standard would. Right?
Is it really the forcing of paper to be used as money (medium of exchange/unit of account) that allows the collective to rob the citizens? Or is it the conning of people into holding said paper as a store of value?? I think it is the latter much more than the former. Both to some extent, but more so the latter.
If people only hold the currency for the short time period of the medium of exchange function, then there is much less for the inflation tax to tax. The higher they turn up the inflation tax, the shorter the time people will hold the paper. In this case, the inflation tax would only be on the difference between your work contribution to the economy and what you could buy with your paycheck two weeks later. And the tax base would be limited to the amount of currency in circulation. But if people hold paper as wealth, the taxable base is orders of magnitude larger, and the inflation tax can be administered more slowly and surreptitiously because of the larger "tax base".
Imagine if every saver in 1909 started holding only gold coins in his possession as soon as they passed the legal tender laws. The parity between paper and physical gold would have snapped long before even the roaring 20's. Roosevelt would have confiscated gold valued in the many hundreds. But people trusted their governments back then. So it was easy to CONvince people that it was better to hold paper with a "yield"!
Fekete notes that no one hoarded gold until AFTER war started in 1914, at which time gold "went into hiding". But imagine if gold went into hiding in 1909 right after the legal tender laws were introduced. Perhaps then, there would not have been war at all. Or at least it would not have been so well funded!
It would sure be nice if Fekete would apply his brilliant mind to this Freegold concept! But alas, he is advocating for a new gold standard. A non-inflationary system, so we can all hold the same money we use in trade as a store of value.
Perhaps the next step in monetary evolution after a period of Freegold will be the elimination of legal tender laws in certain zones in order to gain economic advantage. This would likely be followed by the re-emergence of Fekete's "real bills". Of course I am only speculating way out into the future.
My point is that I like Fekete's analysis. It has great value! Hopefully he can help steer the direction that economic study turns as we pass through this crisis. But what are the odds that the governments of the world will suddenly listen to Antal Fekete and reverse the course of the Titanic in time? Zero perhaps? And even if they did, what would be the immediate consequences? The unintended ones?
My only point is that any superficial differences between Fekete and this blog boil down to the perspective with which we attack the problem. As you say, Shanti, "another angle"!
Fekete takes an activist approach while I take a passive one. Fekete would like to fully remonetize gold, locking it into all monetary functions. I, on the other hand, can see that we are already in the process of fully DEmonetizing gold, which will unlock a tremendous hidden value that is desperately trying to bust out of its shell. In the end, Fekete says that he wants people to have "the right to park their savings in gold coins, as they did before 1909." But they DO have that right already! They just haven't realized how good it will be... yet!
"But what are the odds that the governments of the world will suddenly listen to Antal Fekete and reverse the course of the Titanic in time?"
Why would any government want to listen to Fekete or anyone not busily working on a brand new plan of how to disrobe the people?
What is the purpose of government? To scam, rob and kill people. How is Fekete an instrument for them?
They needs something else, some new idea to replace the paper money system, that equated them to gods for several decades, and only now shows signs of stress. Remember, paper worked great for Reigan, it worked for Clinton, etc. Those who rule governments today, need a fresh scam idea. And if someone has it for them, he can certainly count on their blessings in return.
" Government is legally obligated to pay these huge benefits to retirees. Any attempt to change them via legislation will be challenged in the courts - probably successfully. What must occur is a sea change in opinion of both taxpayers and beneficiaries. Nobody is begrudging these employees a decent pension. But bankrupting the very government they loyally served should not be an option."
One natural probability not mentioned here is the global marketplace devaluing the very denominator of these ridiculously-oversized promises. Then the states can easily meet their obligation. Each pensioner will get one guaranteed square of toilet paper per month... for life!
Did you read Ambrose yet? Not saying I agree, but as we know he is a clever man that has the ability to put up some arguments that at least seem challenging at first.
For instance: Furthermore, I suspect that at least some of China’s grumbling about the dollar slide over recent months has been a ruse to lower the yuan (pegged to the dollar of course) against the euro, yen, and even sterling. The goal is to protect export margins.
An original argument that I did not think of before, and he is correct. If China wants to lower the Yuan, it has to lower the dollar as the Yuan is pegged to it.
His article basically comes down to one sentence in his last paragraph: It is often stated that a currency reflects the strength of an economy over time. Actually, it reflects the strength of a society. I think he does have a point there. What he however fails to discuss are the boundaries of the very society backing the dollar. In his - unstated - opinion the society backing the dollar is the US. I would argue however that the society backing the dollar is comprised of all the people using it. As the dollar is the worlds reserve currency, the society represented by the dollar is far larger then just the US. And as an increasing number of countries are switching to other currencies for trade, I would argue that the society represented by the dollar is drastically weakening.
He also argues that appreciation of the Yuan is inevitable, and believes that it would be a positive event for the dollar. If the Yuan would remain internationally unavailable during that event he might be partly right, but as soon as foreign investors/speculators are allowed to acquire the Yuan that would hurt the dollar rather badly I suppose.
You and Ambrose might be right that a currency is the reflection of its society. It is like the stock certificate of its society. But this causal relationship does not work in reverse. If the Chinese currency rises as it should, there is no way that is a positive thing for the $-FI. Instead, it is a reset to reality.
I have to ponder a bit more on whether a weak currency is always a bad thing, on face value it seems to have worked for China over the past decade.
You and Ambrose might be right that a currency is the reflection of its society. It is like the stock certificate of its society. But this causal relationship does not work in reverse.
By the reverse relationship you mean that a society is a reflection of its currency? I did not argue so, and neither did Ambrose I believe.
Finally, did any of you happen to catch this post on a simultaneous website operation for major banks world wide?
I am not sure if you're on it or not quite yet, but I think you see that in order to swindle today concerns, US can inflate, while China and Russia are protesting publicly, and at the same time receiving silently a part of newly printed money, thus keeping them precisely where they have been. In this manner, the inflation can proceed successfully, leaving behind only fools that trusted the state.
BTW, this is not new. This is exactly how inflation unfolded each and every time, except that the circle of "on the deal" must constantly expand including those who just got the power to do something about it, such as China.
My point is that a currency is a reflection of the strength of the country economy. Weak/Strong currency is neither good nor bad in medium/long term. It is just reflection of the country economy. It is the final balancing act.
When the voting power of the citizens are diluted by the corrupt bureaucracy the "currency" spending, saving or decoupling is the final vote.
the only way to a normal person to fight this battle is to vote them out... i.e. decouple from the currencies until the gov's of the world clean the mess they created. Let's hope we get enough voters for this to happen ;))
Here is an interesting article on deflation. Money multiplyers are collapsing indeed and credit is contracting.
Mad, this one is important: multiplyers for M3 are collapsing. I have witnessed that up close in my country. People just do not get a mortgage anymore.
BEIJING (Reuters) - A man in eastern China has been given a 9-year jail term for buying and selling over 58 billion yuan ($8.5 billion) worth of fraudulent gold futures, state media said on Thursday.
The man, named as Zhang Yong from the prosperous eastern province of Zhejiang, "was accused of illegal operation and flight of capital contribution", the official Xinhua news agency said, citing the court.
Zhang found clients by advertising his services on the Internet, and had more than 1,000 as of June last year for his online trading platform.
"The gold dealing of the company was not connected with the international market ... The company acted as both the buyer and seller and charged a fee from each deal," it added, without elaborating.
"Thus, the United States could pay for its trade deficits either in gold or in dollars. No other nation was allowed to pay for its trade deficits in its own currency; for all other nations, settlement of trade deficits had to be done with gold or with dollars previously acquired in the course of trade with the U.S. or with other nations who had dollars. In other words, dollars - and only dollars - were as good as gold.
General de Gaulle (President of France, 1959 - 1969) has been quoted as saying that this was "an exorbitant privilege". And so it was, a privilege of the victor in World War II."
"If the governments of individual nations want to allow their banking systems to diddle with fractional banking and inflation, it is their right to do so. But when it comes to settling accounts with other nations, they must come up with the required gold."
The Fed faces a binary outcome - crash the equity market to forstall the dollar collapse or inflate until the re4st of the world essentially walks away - read China doesn;t show up at the auction. At this point the Fed must be thinking pulling back stimulus at the risk of deflating assets isnt feasible and ends with the same outcome anyway. Thus jawbone, print sinse wash repeat. The greatest fraud yet is the very notion that the Fed actually has a choice. Much as I have been in the camp of pulling back the stimulus raising rates damn the consequences (we already have 20% unemployment by any reasonable measure) what does such a move really accomplish? So the banks are shut, the states/locals go into receivership and the Fed's are forced to slash and burn. Then what? paradigm collpased. It is pretty clear why the fed will continue to relentlessly print money. Look at the perosnal income numbers - the savings rate at the height of the we need to raise it meme spiked becasue in MAy transfers and taxes hit hgihs and lows respectivily. This while wages declined. The very idea that the Fed has an alternative is the greatest disinformation campaign going. They do not. It is the same debae as the mellonists in the 30s or the Cross of gold speech is it not?
Once you have reconciled yourself to the imposibilities confronting the Fed; it crystalizes why they have lost ocntrol of gold.
"I am afraid that my explanation may disillusion you, but it has always been my habit to hide none of my methods, either from my friend Watson or from anyone who might take an intelligent interest in them."
"Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward."
"It was easier to know it than to explain why I know it. If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact."
"Perhaps when a man has special knowledge and special powers like my own, it rather encourages him to seek a complex explanation when a simpler one is at hand."
"I am pleased to think that I shall be able to free society from any further effects of his presence, though I fear that it is at a cost which will give pain to my friends."
There are a lot of words said about the FED. But is it possible that most of what we think of FED is mistaken?
FED is thought of some sort of independent entity, whether state or private or a mix of both, and controlling some sort of issues at least if not most.
I would dare to say that the FED is nothing but a myth. It doesn't exist. Yes, there are people in the building, there are loud statements, and more often even more loud silence, but yet, there is nothing there.
When Bernanke refused to answer the questions, did it not give you a hint that he is fake? That his defiance is a play? I am sure if it.
There is only one purpose for which the FED exists, and that is to create an appearance, that the money gets borrowed from somebody. Not just created from a thin air, for God sake!
Weren't you a kid? Didn't you invent strangers to explain things that otherwise would not be explainable (after the "found it" and "lost it" would not work anymore)? "A man gave this to me...", "Somebody took it...", etc, etc. Remember?
Similarly, what in the world would you think of them, if there was no FED? What, that they have "Found" the money? What would Chinese say?
Why is FED said to be private at the times, and yet, clearly it the creature and the servant of the state? Because it has to be the state's servant, or it wouldn't be obedient. But it has to look like not connected, private, for the whole charade to look more legitimate. You wouldn't play street gambling with dudes who appear to know each other! Of course they are (congress and fed) all strangers to each other, right!
So, how defiant was Bernanke? Does one need a lot of guts to refuse to answer, when to refuse to answer was his direct order? Refused in face of what? I say refused in face of one man who doesn't know who's tail he actually is stepping on. He wasn't denying anything to the congress, he was under direct orders of the congress.
For these reasons, it is pointless exercise to talk about any figures that FED shows, for just like Bernanke's refusal, the FED will always show the figures it wants to show. We can blabber all we want about a trillion here or a trillion there, on FED's reports. But we wouldn't know a thing about what is going on for real.
You are inching closer to the truth than you may think. The whole system is an elaborate, global illusion. The money itself is an illusion. Why do you think banks are now offering CD's with no early withdrawal penalty? It is a gimmick. It is a carefully constructed illusion. The main goal is to keep people from withdrawing their perceived value from the system. And to create a believable illusion, they have to say, "look, you can withdraw it whenever you want". Study the logical reasoning behind Certificates of Deposit and you will see that a CD that you can close at any time is an oxymoron. It is a new gimmick for desperate times. The whole system and all Fed statistics are a gimmick now, to keep you in their system.
Good stuff Eric.. I'm not sure the gold market will collapse first though. I have no idea of the exact details of how this would work, but if the US treasury wants too they will always be able to buy physical gold on the black market.
There will never be a shortage of physical gold at the right price.. it's just that the price is not the COMEX price.
If you don't mind losing money on every trade you can buy gold on the black market at a high price and sell it through the COMEX at a low price.
That could probably go on for quite a long time.. I mean the amount of money they'd lose through bankrolling the entire COMEX physical delivery is probably still quite small compared to the amounts of money being spent bailing out the banks.
When he talked on the goldstandard it was never clear to me, what he exactly meaned. Did he read FOFOA that brought him to the right camp.......!?!
The problem is that majority of people do not see how the legal tender on paper money exploits their individual wealth. Scholars can talk all they want, and yet, all that will happen in an absence of widespread awareness, will simply be a modification of the scheme of exploitation.
Therefore the whole matter must be made available to the general public in a way stripped of purposeful complications, in an easy and fun to understand manner.
This could probably be done as a game, a mix of monopoly\strategy concepts. The special effort should be made to expose possible complications, such as the arcane calculations and statements of intent to the opposite, to make it clear to the player, that one could employ these as much as he can afford to complicate the matter, and yet, the underlying mechanics won't change.
This should be done before the major ISPs start collapsing due to general economic conditions and possible onset of so called "internet neutrality". Because once they do, collapse, the unique chance to "post the theses on the church doors" trough the "church" (most available medium of efficient distribution of knowledge of today) will be lost.
"The head of a New Jersey-based brokerage firm has suggested that Gold Prices could reach as high as $1,250 per ounce by the end of the year, Bloomberg reports."
"I’m getting whispers from various sources hinting that buying physical gold may soon become almost impossible."
It's between those like Schultz, a legend in himself, with long-time experience in the gold market, and with those managing funds or speaking on behalf of a brokerage, securities firm, bank, insurance firm or a more diversified investment enterprise. While many are no longer private enterprise in the purest sense, dependent on the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, Counterparty Riosk Management Group, front-running trades or other contracts with the USA corporate state, this chasm between experts with experience and all others featured most prominently in MSM is rapidly closing. More and more MSM's spokesmen on gold are conservatively bullish, alluding to previously unheard of gains in gold but with politically correct language of restrained length and hushed tones. Under these modestly embarrassing circumstances, anything else would blow the lid off their private gold lust, almost as frantic as their rush to put out the wildfires spreading like gold fever to satisfy delivery everywhere they look.
Yes. Thank you for the Fekete links. Unfortunately I could not get the radio interview to play. It crashed my internet connection three times. But I am familiar with Fekete's open mint policy.
Fekete's open mint policy is similar to freegold. But once again, it requires an unlikely proactive step by the government, and then it remonetizes the people's gold savings so that they can be gradually brought into use in all monetary roles. This is a great idea, but unlikely.
This open mint policy may end up being a later effect of the natural transition to freegold, the separation of monetary roles. Once gold has proven itself to be a superior store of value against paper currency inflation, there may be a movement to remonetize it into the transactional role, as a direct competitor to paper money in the marketplace. This would be done to give that particular "currency zone" a competitive advantage, and it would utilize the people's gold to do so, thereby costing only the running of the mint.
For a little perspective, read this. Believe it or not there was a political movement at the turn of the century called "Free Silver". This movement followed the end of bimetallism in 1873 and called for the opening of the mint to the free coinage of "the people's silver". Its supporters were called "Silverites". The Cross of Gold speech mentioned by S was a part of this debate.
"To understand exactly what is meant by "free coinage of silver", it is necessary to understand the way mints operated in the days of the gold standard. Essentially, anyone who possessed uncoined gold, such as successful prospectors, or assayers or refiners to whom they had sold their holdings, could deposit it at one of the U.S. Mints, where it would be made into gold coins.The coins would then be given to the depositor, less a small deduction for processing and funding Mint operations. Possibly in most cases the depositor would not receive coins made of the actual gold he had deposited, but would receive his due compensation in coins the mint already had ready. Free silver advocates wanted silver to be accepted by the mints in the same way: if a person deposited enough silver, by weight, to manufacture a silver dollar, then the mint should pay out a silver dollar to that person."
As some of you know, I have only been studying this monetary stuff for two years now. Actually, it will be two years in November. What initially caught my attention was the day the Canadian dollar passed the US dollar in value in November of 2007. And then about six months later I discovered the message of Another and FOA. Five months after that I sold my entire stock portfolio, just days before the September crash in 2008.
At that time I knew I was on to something with this Freegold concept that had been explained by FOA ten years earlier, but it hadn't fully crystallized in my mind yet. On October 6, 2008, when things looked very bleak, I wrote a post called Congress, Remonetize Gold (and Silver) NOW and Save America From a Terrible Fate. This post was a thought experiment based on Fekete's open mint policy which I had just discovered.
"The theory my thought experiment will test is that all Congress would have to do is remonetize “the metals” and the forces of the market place would begin to fix all of our problems through a cascade of events."
Since that day I have learned the important distinction between what SHOULD happen and what WILL happen when it comes to preserving one's wealth through this crisis. This lesson I learned was the very reason Another and FOA spent four years on the gold forums spreading their message. It is the dollar and all of its flaws that have led us to this place in history. Because of the dollar's obsession with gold, we are now entering a period where for the first time the monetary functions will separate out of necessity. It didn't have to be this way, but now it is. As FOA said,
"To their amazement, it turns out today, that digital use demand was the best function that supported their efforts all the while; by increasing the world's use and need for currency. Had they understood this modern economic function early on, they could have somewhat printed the currency outright with almost the same result while arriving at today's destination. They could have let gold float, not to mention they could have skipped a large portion of the debt build up that will now end the dollars timeline."
What he meant was that the post 1971 "purely symbolic dollar" architects thought they needed to cap the price of gold in order to keep the dollar in use. But in fact, it was the dollar's ease of use in the trade function that kept it in demand. Not its illusion of being a store of value. And had they realized this concept then, we could have had freegold soon after 1971 and the dollar would have lasted well beyond 2010. But instead, they set in motion a sequence of events that could only end one way, in the permanent backwardation of the gold market, meaning the emergence of a physical-only gold market at a much, much higher price, and also the end of the dollar's use in global trade.
This is where we are today. And as you watch the volatility in the markets (look a the Dow over the last few days!) think about this statement FOA made eight years ago...
""""""""It's not that price inflation may erupt --------- ------------It's not that the massive dollar debts won't be paid---------The risk is; that our money system requires dollar (goods prices) and debt stability -------- so without said stability the currency system fails""""""""""""
Without an international floating gold reserve pricing, to balance against their devaluing debt reserve, the entire dollar banking system can only rely upon extreme dollar inflation to float it's accounts. Price inflation will have to be ignored. To this end the group of dollar supporting countries, we refer to as the dollar faction, has locked itself into a box. It must find a way to float gold prices"
"The entire dollar banking system can only rely upon extreme dollar inflation to float it's accounts."!!! It must ignore the (hyperinflationary) consequences of this policy and just do it. This is what S(herlock Holmes) uncovered!
Ever since the dollar's poor fundamentals spawned the $-financial industry with its mission of creating a believable illusion that dollar-based debt is a good wealth reserve, that very industry has become a deadly parasite, gradually taking over its host body, the real economy.
"The financial world was reaching into the GDP pie and taking an unnecessary extra 4%. Every year! This extra rent is enough to lower the savings and investment potential of the rest of the economy. And it shows. As mentioned earlier, the growth rate of the GDP had been 3.5% a year for a hundred years. It had proven to be remarkably robust. Even the Great Depression bounced off it, and soon GDP growth was back on the original trend as if the Depression had never occurred. But after 1965, the growth of the non-financial slice, formerly 3.4%, slowed to 3.2%. After 1982 it dropped to 3.1% and after 2000 fell to well under 3%, all measured to the end of 2007, before the recent troubles. These are big declines. It is as if a runner has a growing and already heavy blood sucker on him that is, not surprisingly, slowing him down. In the short term, I realize that job creation in the financial industry looked like a growth driver, as did the surge in financial profits (which we now realize were ludicrously overstated). But in the long term, like a sugar high, this stimulus was temporary and unhealthy.
The financial system was growing because it could. The more complex and confusing new financial instruments became the more “help” ordinary citizens needed from the experts. The agents’ interests were totally unaligned with the principle/clients’ interests. This makes a mockery of “rational expectations” and the Efficient Market Hypothesis, which assumes (totally unproven, as usual) equivalent and perfect knowledge on both sides of all transactions. At the extreme, this great advantage in knowledge and information held by the financial agents has the agents receiving all the rewards"
Good thoughts from Daniel. By the way, the video is the same as the article. In the video Daniel is pretending to speak to a live audience while reading the article! ;)
FOFOA I was reading some of your articles from Mai...and there was a discussion about comparative advatages of the Euro currency with dollar.
Can you write an article where you outline some of the points mentioned there, plus add to the comparision the Yen and some of the more prominent minor currencies.
Especially the possible flows of the capital as the crisis continues .. of course nobody can predict that, but what is more logical.
F.e. some thoughts what will happen if with the flow when there is big demand of $ that happened in 2008.
How the ECB may act if something like this happens with Euro. As the countries diversify this is more and more a posibility.
Why China did not sell alot of its dollars when the 2008 $ vacuum happened, or they had ty's not dollars in their forex reserves ?
More of the prominent Blogs are USA centric. And it becomes more evident that the foreigners will decide how the events will unfold.
Even if it not a prediction at least you can much better put things in perspective that we can discuss later..
all of the USA's liabilities get backed by the Gold at the Treasury - Gold is now $250,000 plus an ounce - perhaps higher...
Is that ok with everyone....those fortunate enough to own some Gold and Silver win - those who don't - well it is not the end of the world.
I would like you to watch the Daniel Amerman video that Raptor posted. Pay attention to what he says at the end about the transfer of wealth that happened in the 70's that few people even noticed. This crisis is very different from the 70's. For physical gold, it will be much more extreme. Only the most stupid among us gold advocates will let their neighbors know how much they benefited from the transfer of wealth that, once again, will go mostly unnoticed.
Or are they going to throw off the chains of the dollar like other countries are trying to do? (Turkey and BRICs.) Thus collapsing the dollar and saving their currencies.
Or will they do nothing and let a strong and stronger currency, the (Euro) destroy their monetary union?
Jim Sinclaire, thinks they will start devaluing the Euro. As all countries will have to devalue along with the dollar to the very bottom of the abyss.
If we have to wait for all currencies to devalue with the dollar to the bottom, this whole thing could really take some time.
In private I am willing to make more bold predictions. On this public blog I like to keep the discussion to macro analyses. That said, the Euro is like a 10 yr old child while the dollar is like a 96 year old dying man. The Euro has not proliferated its debt across the planet for decades on end. Yes, even the OTHER side of the debt is still debt. All the debt that China, the ME and everyone else holds as wealth is still a claim on the failing American economy. The Euro has a healthy gold wealth reserve. It also has a healthy relationship with that reserve. The Euro is not burdened by the need to support a large national deficit. The Euro can inflate right along with the dollar until the dollar's painful death and still rebound in an amazing "underwater beachball" effect. The Euro is the most mature regional currency that is capable of resuming the position formerly held by the dollar. Not that the Euro wants it. Not that it will get it. But yes, it will survive just fine.
Your analysis assumes that everything is correctly priced right now, including the Euro. This is not the case. Surprises will abound!
What you must understand about the Euro is that by supporting the dollar's profligacy (as in the paper gold market, etc...), the Euro is helping the dollar along its way to the grave.
If the Euro takes a large short position on dollars (lending or selling them short to those who need dollars in a liquidity crisis), it is like short selling a bad company you know is going down. The Euro has been shorting the dollar since its birth! And doing so in a way that appears on the surface to be support!
The dollar is in a lose-lose situation no matter which way you look at it. This leaves the Euro in a win-win.
There is much disinformation floating around about strong and weak currencies. It is a lie that a strong currency is bad for a zone.
The central bank's balance sheet only reflects certain liabilities. But they are not the only liabilities against that zone. All dollar debt in the world does not show up on the Fed's balance sheet. In fact, it amounts to many, many times the size of the Fed's balance sheet. And it is all a claim on the dollar zone, the US. It is all a "liability".
Everything you know will be turned upside down when the dollar crashes. It is just something you can't properly project.
There seems a lot of attention to the GOLD in Euro reserves being projected as 15% in these last reply's.
In the meantime the question arises, where is that GOLD stored, (on paper?) is there an actual audit report...?
Thats exactly what Ive wondering. I mean does Germany really think theyre going to get their Gold back from the US? Does anyone really believe that the US still has Gold? How are these countries going to eventually prove what they have? Are they going to put it on flat bed trailers and parade it down the streets of their Capital cities for the world to see?
Thanks for your take on the Euro. I dot have much paper money, just enough to get the essentials to get by. But the Euro is what I have the most of, so its always a concern.
...There is much disinformation floating around about strong and weak currencies. It is a lie that a strong currency is bad for a zone...
Completely agree. There is no difference, whether one currency is a weak or strong one. Absolutely zero. There is a difference if one's currency had weakened or appreciated while in circulation.
Countries of importance, world-wide like US, or regional, like Japan, are no different than money-issuing-authorities of our own. They get richer by being a parasite. The amount that they get richer by depends on the degree of depreciation of the currency they issue while in circulation. It is that same old theft by inflation explained in detail by Mises, Rothbard and North. These countries are parasites on the wealth of other countries, while governments are parasites on the wealth of their own citizens.
A citizen can not protect himself from inflation. The best he can do is to earn it back. But by doing so, he is still giving up the same inflation percentage of his wealth as does everyone else. Except, of course, if he calls his wealth in and holds it ultimately, but then he is unable to profit.
Countries, unlike citizens, can easily protect themselves from the theft by inflation (T.B.I.) initiated by a more powerful state. The state that is wishing to protect itself from TBI, must devalue it's own currency, or "peg" it (if it believes that simply pegging is a sufficient deterrence to TBI"). In effect, such a state gives away an inflation percentage of it's own wealth to a more powerful state, but already cheapened by the rate of it's own inflation. This previous sentence explains why a simple "peg" is either an extremely friendly gesture or an incorrect calculation. To keep one's own, a smaller state must inflate faster than the issuing state, who is a default reserve currency issuer in the region.
Thus, China, is in fact stealing nothing from US, opposite of what people might think or be told by mainstream media.
So, this is why, there is a currency devaluation competition. It is a game of who can steal more, or at least allow less to be stolen from him, amongst the thieves.
As FOFOA said, everything you know is a lie. Once the major currency is out of it's role, then TBI is no longer a treat to a smaller state. Unless that smaller state has an intention of raping it's own citizens, and every other trading partner has decided similarly (or this state now had achieved reserve currency issuer status), there is no advantage to depreciation of the state's currency.
I am not in favor of a gold starndar, I support having no monopoly on money. Monopolies are allways bad for consumers.
That said, it is unfair saying that in the panic of 1907 there was the perfect monetary system for gold standar fans. You could say that from mid 1930's to the civil war (there was fractional reserve, but as far as I know that is the closest any country has been to a "perfect" gold standar).
At the end of the civil war Linconl approved new banking laws. This regulations gave the New York banks priority over the rest of the banking system, and all the rest of the banks of the country would piramid debt on top of their notes. So it was alredy a highly centralized system.

The Avon TrailRiders we fitted in Europe carried us subsequently through everything we threw at them in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Pakistan, India and Myanmar and stayed with us all the way into Thailand... Not bad for one, yes one(!) rear tyre... In our previous 15,000 km report you can read how they compared to the Heidenau K60, K60 Scout, Michelin Sirac and Conti TKC70. The TrailRiders outperformed them in every aspect and despite having been through worse conditions, also lasted longer than any of the above. On this part of the trip we rode together with a friend of ours through India and Myanmar on Conti TKC80s on a 1200 GSA, which weighs the same as my Bonneville. When he was fitting the third full set, we only replaced the first rear tyre... This kind of puts in perspective how long lasting these new Avon TrailRiders are. Yet the grip they give in wet and cold is much better than the TKC80. We also got a reply from another GSA rider who fitted the new Avon TrailRider and found them better off-road than the previously fitted Metzler Tourance Next. But there is more: after 25,000 km we only needed to replace the rear... the fronts are still going!
I want to start by saying we are not paid by anyone to do these reports, nor were we asked by Avon to do them. When we fitted these tyres we wanted to do a full and objective report, including the rate at which they would wear, as getting good data on tyres has always been hard. At the same time, up until then, I had never worried about how long a tyre would last. A tyre is the only bit between my bike and the road, if it looses grip then I lose the bike and quite possibly end up in hospital... or 3 feet under. To me that's slightly more important than how long a tyre will last. I've written before how I find it amazing how people can easily spend a fortune on a good helmet but look for tyres which are just cheap and long lasting. Yet a good tyre can save you from needing to test that helmet. They are the only contact between you and the road and are literally the difference between avoiding a problem... or sliding straight into it.
Having said that, we were now entering a part of the world where getting a replacement was slightly more complicated... Turkey, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, China, Pakistan, India and Myanmar simply don't have bike tyres in the sizes we need. Getting them send up would be a nightmare with customs etc. which is why quite a few travellers carry a full set of spare tyres as the countries above are also known to be hard on tyre wear. The TrailRiders promised longer life and better grip than the best tyres we had found until then: the Avon Distanzias. Surely that wasn't possible?
The only thing we haven't tested them for is stability at high speed, but we didn't have to as the German magazine Motorrad did that for us in a fashion that we could not hope to recreate anyway...They fitted them to a V-Strom 1000 and reported perfect stability at speeds of 180+ km/hr (!) Trust the Germans to test them like that :-) As you can read in our earlier reports, the grip is indeed very good, especially in wet and cold conditions. Now all we needed to find out is if they would go the distance. I think it's fair to say we underestimated the conditions we were about to find in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. See our posts on them to see what I mean. The TrailRiders handled it all very well. Like I've written before, they aren't knobbies but knobbies would have worn out before we even got there. We had also underestimated how hard India and Myanmar would be on tyres (and chains and sprockets for that matter). These tyres have literally been through hell and back and where then thrown into the biggest maddest place of them all: India, with all it's traffic madness that come with it. They haven't seen a decent bit of road for the last 15,000 km of their life either. Come to think of it, Georgia, Kalmykia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan all weren't that easy... but man did we have a good ride!
We rode them till the wear marker, which was 25,000 km or in our case from Europe to Thailand... But that was just the rear tyre. The front is still not up for replacement. The rears showed some unusual tyre wear though. The Avon TrailRider has a triple compound, not a dual compound as I read in a magazine test. Simply put, the centre section is harder than the sides. In the ideal world the sides would wear at the same rate as the centre... but as we look for the twisty roads and try our best to avoid highways like the plague, the sides were wearing slightly quicker than the centre! In the end of the tyre's life, and I mean really at the end, this resulted in a visible step between centre and sides. Both bikes handled fine and the tyres never gave any hint on being worn. I guess that's where the 3rd and underlying compound kicks in to keep it all working in harmony. On Mike's Yamaha it was most visible as we had deliberately been running his rear at below recommended pressure for most of India to nurse him through a back problem. Normally we would have taken a bit of rest but as this part of the world is governed by dumb visa requirements and set dates of entry and exit, we didn't have that luxury. Lowering the rear tyre pressure took the sharp edges off the hammering we've had on bad roads. We knew this would in the end probably destroy his tyre, but chose to sacrifice the tyre over his back. As it turned out he still got 25,000 km out of it.
Having said that, the tyre wear on the XT has always been higher than the Bonneville, as a big single is hard on tyres and chains/sprockets. The tyre on the Bonneville is only just touching the wear marker at 25,000 km. The Yamaha is a little further and should have been replaced perhaps 1,000 km ago. From Europe via Turkey, Georgia, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and China into north Pakistan, followed by an extensive tour through India and Myanmar and into Thailand on one rear tyre... while at the same time having more grip than most if not all others we have seen... To put it in context, had we taken a direct route then one set of Avon TrailRiders would have taken us from London to Melbourne in Australia... or from Anchorage in Alaska to Ushuaia in Argentina... all while offering good grip! That's an overlander tyre like no other we think. We love them. Keep you updated on how long the front will last.
On long and lonely rides, far away from tyre shops, tyre longevity is paramount. They also have to be able to stand intense heat, wildly varying conditions and surfaces and take heavy loading, yet give grip to save our bacon in tricky situations. The TrailRiders did just that.
Baldovino is a bustling trattoria in Santa Croce offering Neapolitan wood-fired pizza as well as creative pastas, salads and other Italian favourites. The owners of Baldovino have opened an enoteca café across the street, which also lures the trendy Santa Croce crowd, who come to enjoy the relaxed atmosphere, tasty light meals and superb wines.
Located in the hub of Santa Croce, Finisterrae is unbeatable for atmosphere. It is a Mediterranean restaurant with quality food and a delightful wine list. This is your ideal starting point for an excellent meal before hitting the high-end wine bars of surrounding Santa Croce.
La Giostra opened its famed doors merely for the love of cooking and it couldn’t be more obvious. The food is outstanding and it is worth visiting Firenze just to sample some of the chef’s old family recipes, especially the tortelloni alla Mugellana (handmade potato-stuffed pasta in ragù), which is one of their signature dishes in the winter months. La Giostra has an endearing ambience and Soldano, the affable manager, greets both new and returning customers like old friends. Ponder over the delectable menu and outstanding wine list whilst enjoying complimentary prosecco and antipasto. We loved the casual, rustic vibe and the consistently exceptional Tuscan fare. We have no doubt that La Giostra will feature on our ‘must-do’ list in Florence for many years to come.
This quaint trattoria, founded in 1550, is located slightly off the beaten track and is a Florentine attraction not to be missed. Whether you dine in the cosy indoor dining space or alfresco on the terrace, you can be certain that every dish will be delicious.
The daily queue out the front of this small trattoria is indicative of the gem that awaits you inside. Trattoria Mario is a Florentine classic with a boisterous atmosphere serving simple but great food at family-style tables. If you cannot read the menu written in mama’s handwriting on the butcher paper stuck to the kitchen wall, then be sure that the Bistecca Florentina will be a great choice.
Could there be anything more indulgent than a stroll over the Ponte Vecchio, browsing some of the world’s finest jewellery? A wander down via Tornabouni overflowing with Italy’s most famous designers comes in at a close second. Perhaps you prefer sipping a glass of Chianti Classico in a Santa Croce wine cellar or savouring a mouthful of tantalising gelato gazing over the River Arno? Florence has it all and so much more. The grandeur of the Duomo is breathtaking, the galleries house some of the world’s most famous artwork and the cafés’ baristas serve only the most perfect espressos. Located near the heart of Tuscany, the options for winery tours and cooking courses are endless, and all easily discoverable as a day trip from Florence.

"... If India were to replace Iran with countries like Saudi Arabia, Russia, Iraq, the USA and others for the 10 per cent of its oil demand then it may have to revert to dollar-denominated imports which mean higher CAD (Current Account Deficit) and deprivation of all other privileges Iran has offered to India", Rahaghi said.
Rahaghi pointed out that Iran had remained a reliable energy partner for India providing oil at a "rationale pricing".
While the U.S. wants all countries, India included, to reduce oil imports from Iran to zero, Washington's ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley had said a fortnight ago that the Americans were open to working with New Delhi on Chabahar in view of its strategic importance, particularly with regard to Afghanistan.
India's oil imports from Iran declined by 15.9% in June, the first month after the USA said it would reimpose sanctions on the country, according to data from shipping and industry sources.
Speaking at a seminar on global diplomacy and bilateral ties with India, Rahaghi said that Chabahar broadens trade opportunities between India, Iran, Afghanistan and more Central Asian countries.
However, the minister said, Iran has passed various difficulties during the past 40 years and today the country is more united and integrated.
Joaquin Phoenix will be the latest actor to play the Clown Prince of Crime, and now we have a better idea of what that could looks like.
He also called India to "work together to immunise the relationship between the two countries" and proposed the adoption of necessary instruments and mechanisms like setting up banking relations, opening new transaction routes and helping each other's markets and business communities.
The drop suggests that despite its initially tough stance on US sanctions, Indian refiners have started changing their mind as the November 4 deadline to wind down business relations with Iran draws nearer. Iran supplied 18.4 million tonnes of crude oil between April 2017 and January 2018 (first 10 months of fiscal 2017-18).
Iran is India's third-largest oil supplier after Iraq and Saudi Arabia. He warned such imports largely would be "sanctionable activity and we will enforce those sanctions". Pompeo said that the USA would consider waivers for certain countries that wish to import Iranian oil, but added that Washington is determined to take a hard line on Tehran.
Meanwhile, however, the Indian government has become the target of criticism both at home and in Iran after it gave in to USA pressure and refiners began cutting imports. "So the United States must abandon its policy of resorting to threats or use of force", said Mr Rahaghi.
The policy was announced after Trump pulled out from the Iran nuclear deal - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - which had been signed by Obama in 2015.
Mr Rahaghi also suggested that a regional dialogue forum should be set up in the Persian Gulf and West Asia to resolve regional crises.

The philosophy of the Music Program is to provide an opportunity for all students to receive a comprehensive music education. Through the study of a wide range of music literature (concert, baroque, classical, folk, jazz, rock, etc.) students can become intelligent consumers, producers, and/or creators of music. The high level of motivation required for performance courses is an invaluable asset to educational growth. School performances and community service, which contribute to developing a sense of responsibility in students, are in integral part of the music activities. Music is an important part of the total education of all students.
We believe that music-in-education changes the culture of a school, supports it in the invention and articulation of its own change, and invokes the school and its community as agents of this change.
We believe that a comprehensive music program assumes its full power in education through the dynamic tension between music as a distinct authentic subject area, and as part of a rich curriculum integrated with other subject areas.
Unlike many other school systems, Cambridge provides music, accessories, and, use of high school owned instruments free of charge. Solo, ensemble and chamber music performances are encouraged. We welcome new students as well as those of you who have performed in previous years. Come and join us! Make music a career for yourself or just come and have some great experiences in the music program!

When a CakeSpy reader recently wrote asking if we had a cotton candy cupcake recipe, the response was immediate: no, but did we ever want to have one.
Cotton candy is one of those foods that is loaded with nostalgia: the billowy clouds of spun sugar conjure visions of idyllic childhood summers, county fairs and carnivals. Now, we don't want to confuse the experience with the product, (after all, there are more realistic pitfalls to cotton candy, like its saccharine sweetness and the sticky, pastel-colored hands it leaves you with) there's no denying that cotton candy is just a happy sort of food.
So when a recipe wasn't immediately available, we decided to improvise; here's what we came up with--a buttery vanilla cupcake topped with cotton candy-infused pink buttercream frosting, topped with even more cotton candy. Not as if they need to be any sweeter, but the Bella Cupcake Couture wrappers and Carnie Cuppie toppers sure did make them cute.
In a mixer with a whip attachment, cream the butter until light and fluffy. Add the sugar and continue to cream. Gradually add the vanilla and eggs and mix in well. Sift together the dry ingredients; then mix into the butter mixture alternating with the milk. Pour batter into cupcake paper-lined muffin tins filling them 3/4 full. Bake until puffed and firm in the center and light golden brown on top, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool. (Freeze at this point, if necessary.)
1 handful cotton candy (we used this prepackaged kind), broken into small pieces, plus another handful for garnish
Gradually add the remaining sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition (about 2 minutes), until the icing is thick enough to be of good spreading consistency. You may not need to add all of the sugar.
Stir in the small pieces of cotton candy, stirring until incorporated. It may melt a little bit into the frosting; this is ok.
Optional topping: tear off chunks of cotton candy and use as garnish; do this last step immediately before serving, because it will wilt if left out.

You're not alone, buddy. But the matter has been given much thought, and a conclusion has been reached: that missing thing is cream filling, and the solution can be found with a certain famous sandwich cookie.
When s'mores meet Oreos, magic--in the form of an oozy, creamy, unapologetically sweet treat--ensues. Basically, you won't be able to believe you've lived this long without them.
CakeSpy Note: I made mine in the microwave, as I am not an outdoorsy type; however, if there is a campfire handy, feel free to make yours using toasted marshmallows.
With One Oreo: If you've elected to use just one Oreo, twist it apart so that the top and bottom are separate. Face the filled side up, and put the chocolate squares on top, then layer the marshmallow half, then top it off with the remaining Oreo half. Put in the microwave at high for approximately 15-20 seconds. The marshmallow may rise and cause the top half of the Oreo to fall off; this is ok. Simply place it back on top upon removing from the microwave, and enjoy immediately.
With Two Oreos: If you're going for the double Oreo version (good decision), repeat the same steps as above, simply using a whole Oreo for the top and bottom. It may take a few more seconds in the microwave, but it's oh so worth it.

Typically after the girls nap in the afternoon, we always go outside and play until it's dinnertime. But lately, we've had lots of rainy days so we've had to find other ways to occupy our time. So on this day, we decided to do a little finger painting. Now Delaney as you can see is finger painting with real finger paint. She's pretty good at it and manages to stay pretty clean as she is used to it. But little Hadley, has not had as much practice and is still in the stage of putting absolutely EVERYTHING in her mouth. I didn't want her to use real paints because I figured they probably don't taste the best! So, I thought vanilla pudding might be a fun alternative for her and boy did I hit the jackpot on that idea. Hadley LOVED it! She loved the pudding so much that she licked it off the table when there was no more (yes I posted a picture of her doing this). The only mistake I probably made in all this was I should have placed a sheet under her chair to catch little bits of pudding she sprinkled on the floor for Buddy to eat! But no worries, Buddy managed to clean up pretty well after her!
it official! you are mom of the year.... i'm sending charlie and gracie to your house to be entertained! :) gracie would love pudding!
Ha! You're too funny...yes Gracie would love the pudding. I felt like Hadley needed to be taken outside and hosed off after she was done! What a mess but she did have fun :)

The terrace was conceived as a recreation space with a social function; however, the project doesn’t deny the service-oriented program that is also fitted within this space.
It also features an open space where a series of hooks embedded in the lateral walls that can either serve as hanging points for a hammock or the clotheslines. Towards the front facade of the house a covered area was created through the construction of a concrete slab that is suspended with a couple of iron columns; underneath it two spaces were created for both a bar and a restroom. The guest room, a volume at the end of the complex, has a private terrace that one can reach through a marine ladder.
The use of exposed materials, construction-style furniture and a close attention to detail were resources that allowed this intervention to drastically transform this space without losing it’s functionality.
Resistant an low maintenance finishes –such as thick lime walls, brushed concrete and clay bars with different pigmentations– were used to create an audacious space with multiple uses in which you can both sun-dry the laundry and throw a barbecue for a group of friends.
Buying or selling a home is no simple business transaction. It takes a team of experts and professionals you can trust to achieve your goals and protect your interests.
Bringing in the right experts at the right time will ensure your purchase or sale goes smoothly and you don’t pay a big personal and financial price. The experts you need may vary, but usually include the services of a REALTOR®, a lender, a lawyer, a home inspector and an insurance agent.
Whether you’re selling or buying, the first individual to get on your team should be a REALTOR®. In Ontario, a REALTOR® is a licensed real estate professional who is a member of a local real estate board as well as the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) and the Ontario Real Estate Association (OREA). This individual has successfully completed an intensive course of study and has skills, knowledge and experience that most buyers and sellers don’t have.
Having a REALTOR® act on your behalf has many distinct advantages. The key benefit is that he or she can negotiate on your behalf, advise you on how to proceed with your purchase or sale and when to bring in the other experts and professionals you’ll need.
The REALTOR® you select should be someone that knows the neighbourhood you live in or want to live in, has a good track record and will handle your sale or purchase as if it were their own.
One of the most important decisions you must make as a seller is deciding the asking price of your home. A REALTOR® can help you analyse your home and compare it with similar properties for sale or recently sold in your area. A REALTOR® will also develop a marketing plan for your home that may include open houses, advertising and listing options. As well, a REALTOR® will provide you with tips on small improvements you can make to help your home “show” better to prospective buyers.
Few people buy a home for cash. Most usually combine savings with money borrowed from a lender through a financial arrangement called a mortgage. Your search for a lender should begin with your search for a home.
Your REALTOR® can assist you in evaluating the many mortgage options and getting financing at the best available interest rates and terms. When deciding which financial institution or lender to deal with, begin with your own bank, credit union on trust company — they already know who you are. But shop around and compare what different lenders have to offer.
Whether you are a buyer or a seller, it’s important to have a lawyer to represent your interests. That’s why you should have one on stand by before you put your home on the market or begin your search for a new home. Real estate documents, such as the agreement of purchase and sale, are complex and should be reviewed by a lawyer who specializes in real estate transactions.
As a seller, it’s wise to have a lawyer review an offer to purchase before signing anything. As a buyer, when an agreement is reached with a seller, a lawyer will help ensure you receive valid title to the property and that it is clear of any registered claims. Your lawyer will also calculate the amount of land transfer tax you will be required to pay as well as any adjustments to compensate the seller for prepaid bills.
If you are a buyer, you can avoid a lot of expensive surprises by bringing in a home inspector as a condition of your offer to purchase. The older the home you plan to purchase – even if it has been substantially upgraded – the more potential there is for problems. Being aware of any structural defects can help you decide whether you want to buy the property at all, or for the price you are considering.
For purchasers, another key member of the real estate team is the insurance broker. Creditors and mortgage lenders, almost without exception, require insurance on the home you buy before any purchase can be finalized. Start by approaching the same broker you use for other insurance policies – often, you are able to negotiate a better rate. But still shop around and ensure you get the coverage you need for what you want.
Swedish metallers IN FLAMES have entered Hansa Studios (DAVID BOWIE, DEPECHE MODE, U2) in Berlin, Germany to begin recording their eleventh album for an early 2014 release.
The band’s lead singer, Anders Fridén, cannot wait to get to work at the legendary facility where such milestones as David Bowie's "Heroes" and Iggy Pop's "Lust For Life" were created.
"When I visited Hansa Studios earlier this year, I got goose bumps," Anders said. "There is so much history both inside and surrounding the studio and I want to be a part of that. Magic has been created here and hopefully that will affect us."

i got the cd because i wanted to hear it in nonmp3 format and because i like the band and didn't want to steal. i'd rather paypal a band some money than buy a cd at target though.
the body the blood the machine is their '06 one, btw. "now we can see" is the new one. i haven't heard that yet.
Funny how for some reason, Odelay just never gets listened to much anymore. When I'm headed to Beck's section on my iPod, I never think "Ooh, Odelay"... yet on nights like tonight, it just really hits the spot. Some of those other gems really get lost amidst the big cl******g singles - Sissyneck and Readymade really stood out tonight. Great stuff, classic album.

Today, we're mosting likely to look at just how to generate leads on Facebook. You will learn what list building is, exactly how Facebook list building works, a review of demand generation, what a channel is, and also what you can do to generate your very own leads on Facebook.
Many people imagine having a fast expanding company. Whether it’s going to the top of your market, being part of the 3%, getting on Forbes Top 50 under 50, or simply having more flexibility. Having a working plan in position for consumer procurement is vital to quick growth. As well as list building is where all of it begins.
A lot of new organisations fall under the “temporary” trap. We’ve all heard of the saying, “The lawn is greener beyond.” Well there’s another just as bothersome state of mind, “There’s got to be an easier/faster way.” I can understand. All of us require to consume. As well as there are times when chasing after the following dish becomes the only point that matters just to get to the next month. Yet … the catch is staying there also long that it becomes business-as-normal.
If you have actually been there as well lengthy you may acknowledge several of the signs and symptoms. Have you ever felt that you remain in a rollercoaster company? It’s busy one month as well as dead quiet the next. Have you ever before switched over to a brand-new method, prior to offering the very first one-time to expand? You have actually purchased systems, modern technology, or coaching and then switched to chase what appears like a shinier object, prior to reaping the incentives from your earlier initiatives.
First, allow’s begin with lead generation. It is very important to have a strong grasp of the subject as lead generation an essential component of growing a business.
In advertising and marketing, lead generation is the initiation of inquiries into a businesses products or services. Leads can be developed for the purposes such as checklist building, e-newsletter lists purchase or for sales leads. Leads can originate from different sources.
Once caught, a salespersion evaluations and also certifies the lead. If regarded to have prospective, the lead obtains transformed to an opportunity for business. The chance after that has to undertake several sales stages prior to the bargain is won.
Lead generation therefore goes to the top of the sales channel. There is much debate in the sales profession regarding what makes up an actual “certified” possibility. It’s generally concurred that FINDING REAL ESTATE LEADS is a good formula. A certified possibility has the budget, authority, requirement and also the timing is right. While it’s feasible to get some of this details beforehand, this action requires sales prospecting. The procedure of connecting to a lead as well as just after this action does the lead credentials start. I have actually seen many individuals fall into the mistaken belief that lead generation ought to bring them pre-qualified leads. The best a well designed project can do is help identify people probably to have better top quality ratings. No matter how you do cut it, it still takes a human to qualify a lead.
