Despite never writing about it directly, explicitly—the way he wrote about cruise ships or Roger Federer or the eating of lobsters—David Foster Wallace had a keen and lifelong interest in the brain. There was an obvious personal reason for this: on most of the days of his life, he consumed brain-altering chemicals as a way to stave off suicidal depression. His first published short story is essentially an extended musing on the connections between chemicals, the brain, and subjective wellbeing. These interests continue to animate his early works; both The Broom of the System (1987) and Girl with Curious Hair (1989) are peppered with offhand but learned references to neuroanatomy. Paul D. MacLean’s once-popular triune brain theory appears in Infinite Jest, and there are also quieter references to Gilbert Ryle and Julian Jaynes—two other well-known theorists of the relations between neurology and the mind. As Wallace scholar Stephen J. Burn has put it, analyzing The Pale King (2011), Wallace nurtured a “career-long fascination with consciousness.”
His 2004 short-story collection Oblivion has always been a somewhat confusing book: dense, obtuse, cold, fragmented, a little cruel. However, while penning a PhD thesis on the intersections between neuroscience, theories of consciousness, and modern Anglo-American literature—a Wallacian labyrinth of thought if ever there was one—I think I have come to understand Oblivion for what it really is: A work of horror fiction, whose unique brand of horror is rooted in Wallace’s reading about the brain.
In the eight years between Infinite Jest and Oblivion, Wallace’s reading in neuroscience and consciousness studies intensified. His essay “Consider the Lobster,” published almost in tandem with Oblivion, displays a sophistication of engagement with neuroscience that outstrips any of his previous work, referencing nociceptors and prostaglandins and endorphins and enkephalins. The more precise direction of Wallace’s reading is indicated by two books found in his personal library (preserved today at the Harry Ransom Centre at UT in Austin): the Danish popular science writer Tor Nørretranders’s The User Illusion, and Timothy D. Wilson’s Strangers to Ourselves. Wallace read both of these works of popular consciousness studies closely, and what he took from them is revealed by his annotations. In Nørretranders’s The User Illusion, Wallace has heavily underlined a section where Nørretranders writes “Consciousness is a fraud.” On another page Nørretranders has written “Most of what we experience, we can never tell each other about—we can share the experience that through language we are unable to share most of what we experience.” In his copy, Wallace has underlined this paragraph, and written, at the top of the page, “Loneliness—Can’t Talk About It.” In Wilson’s Strangers to Ourselves, alongside Wilson’s remark that “Freud’s vision of the unconscious was far too limited,” Wallace’s scribbled note reads “omniscient not on conscious thought but on unconscious drives” [sic]. Most of what we think of as self-directed behavior, explains Wilson, may well be actually “non-conscious intention.”
These quotes give you a sense of these two books, both of which build on what Alan Richardson calls “one of the great lessons of the cognitive revolution”: “just how much of mental life remains closed to introspection.” As a brief summation, the unified thesis of Nørretranders’s and Wilson’s works looks something like this: We are not really in control. Not only are we not in control, but we are not even aware of the things of which we are not in control. Our ability to judge anything with any accuracy is a lie, as is our ability to perceive these lies as lies. Consciousness masquerades as awareness and agency, but the sense of self it conjures is an illusion. We are stranded in the great opaque secret of our biology, and what we call subjectivity is a powerless epiphenomenon, sort of like a helpless rider on the back of a galloping horse—the view is great, but pulling on the reins does nothing.
If this description of reality feels familiar to you, it’s because such a neuroscientifically inspired pessimism is a quiet but powerful strain of modern thinking. It lurks in the shadows of the breezy materialism professed by science popularizers such as Richard Dawkins and Neil deGrasse Tyson—who tend to shroud the meaninglessness behind a smokescreen of excitable awe. Raymond Tallis calls the worldview conjured by works such as Nørretranders’s and Wilson’s “biologic pessimism.” In its broad strokes, the shadow of biologic pessimism is what dismayed a young William James. Today, it informs the work of the philosopher John Gray, and has found its most popular advocate in the character of Matthew McConaughey’s Rust Cohle, in HBO’s True Detective. When Cohle explains to Woody Harrelson’s character that he thinks “human consciousness is a tragic misstep in evolution,” and that “we are things that labor under the illusion of having a self,” what sounds like poseurish gloom actually an entirely rational, reasonable interpretation of the modern scientific paradigm. As Wallace himself put it elsewhere, in his not-so-compact history of infinity, what science tells us is that “our love for our children is evolutionarily preprogrammed” and “our thoughts and feelings are really just chemical transfers in 2.8 pounds of electrified pâté.”
The character of Rust Cohle in True Detective links nearly back to Wallace’s Oblivion by virtue of the fact that the character of Rust Cohle was based to an almost plagiaristic degree on the nonfictional musings of another American fiction author: Thomas Ligotti. Ligotti, probably the finest living American horror writer, has built a whole fictional style upon the same pessimistic interpretation of the brain sciences that Wallace himself appears to have arrived at independently. And though Wallace, unlike Ligotti, is not known first and foremost as a horror author he was in fact a lifelong fan of the genre. His teaching syllabi included Stephen King, he adored the work of Thomas Harris (particularly Red Dragon), and he praised Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian as “probably the most horrifying book of this century.” Wallace was also a “fanatical” David Lynch fan, and wrote a long piece praising his work for being “not about monsters…but about hauntings, about evil as environment, possibility, force.” For Lynch, Wallace wrote, “Darkness is in everything, all the time—not ‘lurking below’ or ‘lying in wait’ or ‘hovering on the horizon’: evil is here, right now.”
As it turns out, Wallace’s assessment of the special atmosphere of Lynch’s horror (published in 1996) functions as an uncannily accurate description of his own Oblivion (published in 2004). Oblivion was a strange collection that quietly baffled many readers, both when it was first published and to this day. But when you understand that the whole collection is about the horror of consciousness, what first appears as a fragmented piece of work achieves cohesion. With Oblivion, these two deep-set interests—the brain, and dispiriting interpretations of its nature and relationship to our subjective lives; and horror—collide.
“Mr. Squishy,” Oblivion’s opening piece, is infused with an air of subjectivity as helpless, capricious, and buffeted by winds of influence over which it has no control. The pitiable protagonist, Terry Schmidt, is tortured by his lust for a co-worker, and is driven to masturbation “without feeling as if he could help himself.” In his imaginings he cuts a pathetic figure, and he is troubled by “his apparent inability to enforce his preferences even in fantasy.” The state of affairs, we learn, “made Schmidt wonder if he even had what convention called a Free Will, deep down.” (Readers may know of Benjamin Libet’s famous experiments, often taken as strong neuroscientific evidence of the non-existence of free will.) Schmidt has “had several years of psychotherapy,” but remains helpless. So total is his isolation of self, that Schmidt is on the verge of “making a dark difference with a hypo and eight cc’s of castor bean distillate”—that is, committing mass murder via mass-poisoned commercial confectionary.
In “The Soul Is Not a Smithy,” a ranging recollection of a day in the childhood of an unnamed adult narrator, filters through the claustrophobia of an anxious mind a pitch of ascending dread and doom, the presence of violent insanity, and a lethal culmination. Evoking directly Wallace’s neuroscientific reading, the narrator muses that “that the most vivid and enduring occurrences in our lives are often those that occur at the periphery of our awareness.” The big cruel joke of “The Soul Is Not a Smithy” is that the narrator’s consciousness is so capricious and fickle that it has missed absorbing “the most dramatic and exciting event I would ever be involved in in my life.” The entire story is the narrator’s attempt to learn about an event that he rather ludicrously has no real first hand knowledge of because of his inadequate brain.
The flash fictional “Incarnations of Burned Children” seems to darkly riff upon this chronic mind-scatteredness which blights so many of Oblivion’s cast, by having the awful events of the story render the father’s “mind empty of everything but purpose”—a state the narrators of the rest of the collection could never hope to achieve. Only under such awful extreme duress, it suggests, might consciousness reach something like an unfiltered, directional tone. “Another Pioneer” has at its heart the horror of (brain-based) self-consciousness: Within the nested story, doom for the jungle village follows the moment when the child messiah’s “cognitive powers [bent] back in on themselves and transformed him from messianic to monstrous,” powers “whose lethal involution resonates with malignant self-consciousness”—a self-consciousness that was a constant theme of Wallace’s work, and which the story declares can be found “in everything from Genesis 3:7 to the self-devouring Kirttimukha of the Skanda Purana to the Medousa’s reflective demise to Gödelian metalogic.”
This crushing weight of self-consciousness is at the heart of Oblivion’s most famous story, “Good Old Neon,” which n+1 called the collection’s “one indisputable masterpiece.” The pseudo-narrator of “Good Old Neon,” Neal, has spent his life tortured by “the fraudulence paradox”: “the more time and effort you put into trying to appear impressive or attractive to other people, the less impressive or attractive you felt inside—you were a fraud.” The pressure eventually becomes so great that Neal kills himself. The crucial point is that all of Neal’s extensive and extensively described suffering can be located in the makeup and character of the human brain, not society or culture. By the end of the story the strong impression is that Neal’s condition is but a particularly acute version of a basic human predicament. As he puts it, it’s “not as if this is an incredibly rare or obscure type of personality.” In the modern neuroscientific paradigm, Neal’s suspicion that “in reality I actually seemed to have no true inner self” is absolutely correct. There is really nothing outlandish about Neal’s fears; within Oblivion’s neuropessimism, they are simple truisms. We do experience time poorly; language is in many ways a weak tool. The same goes for his fear that he is “unable to love:” from a hard Darwinian viewpoint, we are all unable to love, really—or more accurately, what we think we are doing when we love is actually not loving at all as we understand that word. Neal recognizes this himself: “we are all basically just instruments or expressions of our evolutionary drives, which are themselves the expressions of forces that are infinitely larger and more important than we are.”
In the title story, “Oblivion,” the protagonist and his wife are so incapable of accurately telling perception from reality that one or both of them can’t tell when they are awake and when they are asleep. The narrator’s “seven months of severe sleep disturbance” have made for a “neural protest” of symptoms that underpin the story’s oppressive, nervous atmosphere. This atmosphere achieves full bloom in Oblivion’s closing novella, “The Suffering Channel,” which features the story’s eponymous production company and their “registered motto” “CONSCIOUSNESS IS NATURE’S NIGHTMARE.” (A quotation from the famous pessimist philosopher Emil Cioran, who wrote books with such cheery titles as The Trouble with Being Born.) “The Suffering Channel” features various lonely people failing to connect via their “tiny keyholes” of self. The story’s focus on defecating is really an extended metaphor for the interior, the private–that which is common to all, but which is very rarely (to contaminate the metaphor) pushed through the keyhole. Our inability or social aversion to share with one another the deepest workings of our large intestines mirrors our inability to share the deepest workings of our minds. What we have is scatological representation of what philosophers call the Hard Problem. All of the characters of “The Suffering Channel” labor under “the conflict between the subjective centrality of our own lives versus our awareness of its objective insignificance”—in and of itself the overarching tragedy of the whole of Oblivion.
Ultimately, just as Wallace wrote that David Lynch’s movies were about “not about monsters…but about hauntings, about evil as environment, possibility, force;” that for Lynch “Darkness is in everything, all the time—not ‘lurking below’ or ‘lying in wait’ or ‘hovering on the horizon’: evil is here, right now”–Oblivion is a collection about horror as the basic state of existence. The darkness and dread and horror of Oblivion is not in monsters or evil people; it is in the environment, in all of us, in our neurology and fraught consciousness and ill-evolved minds. Ligotti has written that all real horror writing, from Ann Radcliffe through to H.P. Lovecraft, is motivated by the specter of “the universe itself as centerless and our species as only a smudge of organic materials at the mercy of forces that know us not.” By these standards, Wallace, driven by his voluminous reading in the brain sciences, joins the club. In my thesis—academia being a world where the coining of neologisms is a mark of one’s stunningly original thinking—I refer to this style of existential horror, rooted in an interpretation of modern neuroscience, as neurohorror.
If there is a chink of philosophical sunlight, it is that Wallace may not have totally believed in the worldview of biologic pessimism. Oblivion and Wallace’s final, tortuously produced, unfinished novel The Pale King were heavily intertwined. Wallace used the same notebooks for each, and funneled sections of one into the other as he went. Many critics think that the unrelenting misery of Oblivion was supposed to find its relief and counterpoint in its novelistic partner. As Wallace’s biographer D.T. Max puts it, “while Oblivion was descriptive, The Pale King was supposed to be prescriptive. It had to convince the reader that there was a way out of the bind. It had to have a commitment to a solution that Oblivion lacked.” The neurohorror of Oblivion may have represented a flexing of Wallace’s pessimist muscles, in advance of an attempt to overpower them. As Wallace himself said in an interview, “any possible human redemption requires us first to face what’s dreadful, what we want to deny.”
I mentioned that the biologic pessimism that caught Wallace’s attention mirrored that which preoccupied William James a century prior. Wallace’s potential solution or counterargument also mirrored James’s. Indeed, in the very same books that inspired Wallace’s neuropessimism, we find him searching for a more sanguine and more Jamesian reading. On page 129 of Nørretranders, Wallace underlined “You can direct your attention where you like.” On 133, he has underlined “the headiness of attaining high, clear awareness,” and under a section explaining the cortex he wrote “change in attention cause activity change in cortex” (sic). The brain might be the problem, but it appears that within these books Wallace was searching for a way for the brain to also become part of the solution. Underneath a quoted passage from William James, he wrote “Able to Choose Focus of Attention.” This would become the backbone to the hard-won optimism of “This is Water.”As David H. Evans has written, James put “activity rather than passivity at the core of our relation to the world” by affirming the subjective power of “the possibility of choice”–choice in terms of, to quote “This is Water,” “some control over how and what you think” over “what you pay attention to…how you construct meaning from experience.” This basic stance can also be observed in other thought systems Wallace was drawn to during his life, notably Buddhism.
The most pessimistic reading of all, though, must draw attention to the biographical elephant in the room: Wallace’s suicide. In the end, it was his brain—suffering with terrible withdrawal after years of being awash in the chemical mix of Nardil—that killed him. He couldn’t think his way out, couldn’t “construct meaning from experience” in a way that made something other than suicide the best option. It’s possible to see this as a cruel and tragic vindication of the neuro-determinism which colors Oblivion. He completed Oblivion, but wasn’t able to finish its optimistic companion The Pale King, despite years of trying—there is a sort of horrible literary mirror of Wallace’s own inner life there. Unlike in fiction—where, despite it all, at the end of HBO’s True Detective, Rust Cohle is able to remark hopefully that “the light’s winning”—we don’t choose our endings. Wallace dug deeply and unflinchingly into the real challenges of modern existence; he made us “face what’s dreadful, what we want to deny.” It remains with the rest of us to figure out how to live with it.

Minthorn Hall is George Fox University's oldest building. It is also a place where U.S. President Herbert Hoover lived and played as a boy in Newberg. Constructed in 1887, the building is older than the university itself. It was built for Friends Pacific Academy, the forerunner of the university, and was moved to its present site in 1892, one year after the university was founded. According to the Newberg Graphic of July 1, 1892, the building was moved by Mr. Clark, a Portland house mover, who brought all his moving equipment up the Willamette River on the old Jefferson Street ferry boat which he had acquired a short time before. When constructed as a two-story building at the original site, it was a boys' dormitory and gymnasium. At its new location (for the last 110 years) a third level was added--a daylight basement. In being named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997, the building was cited as "a classic illustration of adaptive use of one of the oldest private college buildings in Oregon" and was described as "the sole physical link tying together (the) entire academic history from infant Friends Pacific Academy to thriving George Fox University." It is said to meet the National Register's Criterion A as the symbolic "Old Main" of George Fox University and to be "significant locally and regionally as the only building associated with the complete history of Quaker secondary and higher education in the Pacific Northwest."
Hoover, the 31st president of the United States, resided in Newberg from 1883 to 1889. It is believed that he lived in the dormitory for a few months in the 1887-1888 school year and played in the gymnasium. After being orphaned at the age of eight in Iowa, Hoover came to Newberg to live with his uncle Henry John Minthorn, the first principal of Friends Pacific Academy, and his wife, Laura. Their home, two blocks from the George Fox University campus, is now the Hoover Minthorn House museum, also on the National Register of Historic Places. It is their name that is honored by George Fox's first building.
I first started programming computers in BASIC back in 1982. By 1984, I had written a full-featured graphics editor for the TRS-80 and later moved on to 6809 assembler and C. It was around this time I discovered both Zork and Elite, and my ideas about games changed forever.
Years later, I picked up a bit of Java, Prolog, COBOL, VBA, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and now focus my time building large-scale Perl applications. I regularly give keynotes at conferences across Europe and the US and teach Perl, software testing, database design, Agile process for management, and software architecture.
Many strong developers building their first Web-based game quickly discover that constructing items is not an easy task. This post shows how to modify the game loop driven Entity-Component-System pattern for click-driven games.

Eldest son of afrobeat pioneer Fela Kuti, grandson of political campaigner, traditional aristocrat and women's right activist Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, Olufela Olufemi Anikulapo Kuti is renowned in his own right.
Femi Kuti, committed to social and political change reaching an ideal free and fair Nigeria, blends colorful tunes into distinctive balanced sounds with 'Positive Force' , the band he seeded in 1985.
Femi Kuti was born in 1962 London and grew up in Nigeria. His musical career started at the tender age of fifteen when he played in his fathers band Egypt 80 in the year 1979.
In 1986, December the 13th, Femi initiated the launch of Positive Force, his own vibrant with his sisters Sola and Yeni as lead dancers. This was his independent launch apart from his father legacy. The very first Positive Force performance was the University of Lagos.
By 1991 MYOB was released and four years later the Femi Kuti album was released. In 1998 the release of “Shoki Shoki” garnered widespread acclaim.
In 2000 he opened The Shrine, his club, where he recorded the live album Africa Shrine. He won a Monaco “World Music Award” that same year! In 2001 he collaborated with Common and Mos Def on Fight to Win, and then toured the United States with rock band Jane’s Addiction.
Due to personal setbacks, there was a four-year absence. But there was a re-emergence in 2008 with Day by Day and Africa for Africa in 2010, his third Grammy nomination.
His diverse knack of artistry expanded in the next Grammy nomination, No Place for My Dream . Like the legendary Fela Kuti, he is committed to political and social causes and fights for the emancipation of Nigeria.

I knew from a very young age must have been 5,6, or 7. It was just a question of how. Finally went full time into music joining my father’s band at age 16/17.
The love for my children, it is uncompromising it is. And also my commitment to keep trying to be the best I can musically.
It’s never being about money really. Love for what I do must important for me. Remaining steadfast to what my music stands for.

MAD 3 Art Fair: Grey Area are showing at the Multiple Art Days fair at La Maison Rouge, 26th - 28th May 2017
For his solo exhibition at BALTIC 39, his first in a public gallery in the UK, Grey Area artist Matt Calderwood will create a series of ambitious new sculptures which explore decaying and collapsing systems and the impact of environment and process on simple everyday materials. Made of fragile, degradable materials and interlocking elements, the works will be installed on the gallery?s roof terrace where they will weather and decompose, their delicate surfaces recording their exposure and deterioration. They will then be dismantled and reassembled over the course of the exhibition. Calderwood will also present a site-specific sculptural video installation showing new and recent films, each documenting a performance in which the artist experiments with balance, tension, instability and risk.
Vernissage Friday, March 11th, 18:30 - 20:00. Under the 'Weekend of Contemporary Art Voice Figures' Nick Laessing will give a performance on March 19th at 18:30. Curated by Bettina Klein.
On occasion of the Nouveau Festival du Centre Pompidou German artist Christoph Keller proposes to revisit the banished concept of the Aether. The exhibition explores the question of how the inconceivable is conceived by both science and art, tracing possible interpretations between cosmology and consciousness. Espace 315 will display a specific spatial situation including a series of graphic and photographic works selected from the fields of science and art, as well as installations by contemporary artists. Furthermore an ongoing program of lectures, films and events are presented in a built-in amphitheatre throughout the festival. Artists requested include John Smith, Mariana Castillo Deball, Joachim Koester, Adolf Wölfli/ Daniel Baumann, David Maljkovic, Cyprien Gaillard, Nick Laessing. Graphic works by Étienne-Jules Marey, Thomas Ruff, Étienne Léopold Trouvelot, Gisèle Freund, Ugo Rondinone, René Descartes and many others.
The exhibition focuses on artists who produce drawings with machines or mechanisms following the path opened by Jean Tinguely's drawing (and painting) machines Méta-Matics, but also by self imposed rules echoing the mathematical basis of mechanical procedures, such as Alighiero Boetti, Sol LeWitt and William Anastasi.
Outer Worlds will open on 30 November and features artists including Ruth Blesi, Paul Fryer, Simon Hollington, Guy Allott, Heather and Ivan Morrison, Walker and Bromwich, Genevieve Biwer, Cornelia Parker, Adam Fuss, Troika and Tobias Collier.

I’ve learned the hard way (burning HUGE hole in my pocket) on the prices affecting the toy prices. Therefore, I’m going to share on the Economics of Toy prices. Please note this is not a guide to for toy price speculation/ investment. This is merely a personal tip for collectors to enjoy the hobby at affordable level.
Okay lets touch on the economics of the price. This is a basic game of supply Vs Demand; low supply, high Demand, leads to high price; or vice versa. Sound simple? Actually it is more complex than what you will expect. Continue reading →
I always thought that 1/6 figures are the same as “Ken” from Barbie Doll toys series, except those “ken” are wearing tactical suits and equipped with deadly weapons. Until 18 months ago, I met my first 1/6 figure, Soldierstory FBI Critical Response Group and the face sculpt is incredibly realistic and detailed (can even notice the pores on the face). The figure was simply too COOL to resist and I paid $200 for it and spent 3 hours to put on the gears and weapon on the toy. Continue reading →

"Karl marked his 50 years of Perkins Academy board membership just a few years ago and this November has completed his wonderfully revealing and entertaining manuscript “Made in South Woodstock, Vermont, Tales From the Village That Raised Me.” This could be the perfect holiday gift for that Woodstock resident who thought they had everything!
"Anyone who has known Karl through the years or has spent time with him around the table at The South Woodstock Country Store is well aware of Karl’s story-telling expertise. As Karl penned in the forward to his new manuscript, I could say I’m here in the same village where I grew up, but that is not really correct; South Woodstock, Vermont, and I have changed every day of the nearly eighty years we’ve been together.” Karl went on to say, “It’s been my good fortune to be the repository of a great deal of history: old family letters and journals, town records, and stories that I have heard (and overheard). This information has given insight, not only into those who came before me, but perhaps a better look into the world that I have occupied and will leave to those who follow me.”
"As always, our mission at GMPA & HA is to educate by preserving the Academy building, its artifacts, personal papers, and records pertaining to the Academy, its students, and the South Woodstock community, of which Karl Wood, his family, and his ancestors have been such an integral part since the late 1770s."
Microgrids a Solution for Local Energy Demands Grid-tied electrical energy systems based on central energy production are inherently inefficient and overall cost is much higher than off-grid or microgrid systems. Off-grid electric energy systems as well have their disadvantages as they need to meet peak energy demands rather than cover average energy demands. In addition, some form of energy storage is required as energy generation is not consistent throughout the day or the season and is generally sized to meet the peak energy demands . A solution to these disadvantages is found in microgrid systems where a community, town or city shares the electricity through bidirectional power management units. In this scenario every household requires a much smaller energy production system as it only needs to meet the average energy consumption whereas peak demands are covered by the microgrid which is coupled to peak demand generators that run on carbon neutral biofuels. Individual storage capacities are reduced or eliminated as the number of units in the microgrid increases. Where microgrids are not an option in an off-grid scenario, integration of a small peak demand generator (3-10 KW) reduces the size of the primary energy production system such as photovoltaic or wind to meet the average demands and minimizes the need for large storage capacities.

In the wake of Madonna's success, many dance-pop divas filled the charts, but out of them all, Paula Abdul was the only one who sustained a career. The former L.A. Lakers cheerleader and choreographer began to make inroads in pop music when she was hired as an assistant dance director on the Jacksons' Victory tour, which led to a job choreographing Janet Jackson's videos for Control. Abdul's work on Jackson's videos helped make the album a hit, making her a sought-after choreographer. After working on The Tracy Ullman Show and videos for ZZ Top, Duran Duran, and the Pointer Sisters, Abdul began a recording career, releasing her debut album, Forever Your Girl, in 1988. The first two singles drawn from the record were moderate hits, but the release of "Straight Up" at the end of the year made her a superstar. Staying at the top of the charts for three weeks, "Straight Up" began a string of six number one singles (with "The Way That You Love Me" recharting at number three in 1989) that ran through the summer of 1991.
Abdul's singles were hits not because her singing was exceptional ( her voice is thin and transparent ) but because she worked with savvy producers who had a knack for picking songs with solid pop and dance hooks. Abdul's spectacular big-budget videos helped push the sales of Forever Your Girl past seven million in the U.S. alone. While her second album, 1991's Spellbound, wasn't as successful, it still sold over three million copies and spent two weeks at number one.
After Spellbound, Abdul took a few years off. During that time, she successfully fought a lawsuit filed by a former backup singer who alleged it was she, not Abdul, who had sung on Forever Your Girl. Abdul released her third studio effort, Head Over Heels, in the summer of 1995, but the album failed to match the success of its two predecessors. The singer withdrew from the spotlight for several years before resurfacing in 2000 to co-write "Spinning Around" for Kylie Minogue. Debuting at the top of the charts in Australia and the U.K., the single effectively relaunched Minogue's career, and Abdul experienced a similar surge in popularity when she joined the judging panel of American Idol in 2002. Her positive comments and erratic behavior made her a household name to millions of young T.V. viewers who hadn't grown up with Abdul's music. Rumors began to circulate in 2007 about Abdul's return to the studio, and a statement on her website in January 2008 confirmed them, promising a new Abdul album by that summer.

Two thousand bar, such an enormous water pressure does not even exist in the darkest regions of the ocean deep. In the Upper Bavarian city of Murnau such values are on the daily agenda - even though it’s located above sea level. This extreme pressure is reached thanks to the brand-new hydroforming machines at TT-3Ds.
The term hydroforming refers to a still young technology. Simply put, with this forming method, a plate is pressed against the wall of a mould by extremely high water pressure and thus exactly replicates its morphology. Unlike the deep-drawing technology, you just need one tool for hydroforming. »Furthermore, we can achieve almost infinitely small radii«, Dirk Bendl, the manager in Murnau explains the benefits of this new technology. »With this technology our developers get totally new possibilities. Finally, we can create also spherical shapes. Of course, the shape of a product is a design element in the first place, but for us it is crucial to create even more functional products thanks to this new procedure.«
A good example of gain in functionality is the hydroformed engine guard for the latest generation of the BMW R 1200 GS. »With classical constructions featuring trimmed and welded aluminum elements, manifolds must be omitted, but in this new single-piece engine guard they are included thanks to its detailed shaping. This fact ensures much more protection, as especially in hot conditions the manifolds are very sensitive to stone chips«, Bendl knows.
With hydroforming, stainless steel can be processed just as aluminum or simple sheet steel. As a result, there are numerous fields of application. »Crucial for us is the fact that due to the almost unlimited shaping options, we can meet specific requirements even better«, Bendl says. »With the forming, we can, for example, include beadings to precisely determine the strength and torsional stiffness of the single parts. That means that component parts we made so far of thick aluminum, we can in future manufacture from much thinner stainless steel plates«, the technician explains further aspects of this procedure.
In contrast to the well-known tube hydroforming, i. e. two welded sheet metal parts are widened by water pressure from the inside to be turned into a tubular part (two-stroke exhausts are a familiar application), sheet hydroforming enables TT-3D to create complex shapes with precise repeatability. However, this requires a lot of expertise. »Sheet hydroforming is still a young technology. There are almost no universal experiences. In many fields we do pioneering work« Dirk Bendl points out. Especially the cutting and the preparation of the plate to be inserted into the machine is a big challenge for the developers. Only if the plate is dimensioned perfectly, material can flow out of the flange section during the forming process in the precise amount required. »We bought our machines from the leading manufacturer. However, we modified them a lot for our requirements. The fixture construction and tool making is also done in-house«, the manager describes the organization of manufacturing. Thus, Touratech has every work step from design up to the toolmaking, the forming itself and further processing under one roof.
However, the final processing does not take place at TT-3D in Murnau, but in Niedereschach. There are the 3D-laser devices giving the primary product its final shape, i. e. by cutting out apertures and screw holes. However, compared to conventional procedures, with hydroforming one work step can be saved: the surface finishing afterwards. Even delicately brushed plates withstand the reshaping with unscathed surface. »That does not mean, of course, that we have to go without a further refinement of the hydroformed parts«, Bendl adds.
Not necessarily with 2000 bar but in any case with high pressure Touratech and its sister company TT-3D are working on even better motorcycle accessories by using the latest technology. There will be some more innovations in the field of hydroforming in the course of this year, Dirk Bendl indicates with a cheeky smile.
I have to admit that my habit of collecting images has led me into a trap, I know I had visited a good amount of museums this year, both in London and in Spain, I have taken images from pieces and the small cards next to the but I am a bit lost about the name of the museum, In this post I will try to select and reference the origen of this pieces.
To be honest, What attracts me the most about this piece is the way the artist depicts the pool underneath the main orthogonals, I think this creates a magnificent effect.
Similar to the one on the Tate Britain, I was pretty intrigued by the perspective system inside this piece.
There are many reasons why I like this piece; the anamorphosis, the fixed view point, the three-dimensionality of the painting and the fact that this was made on the late Renaissance.
I was attracted to the use of a mirror to create this illusion of immersion, this has been a recurrent subject in my work, I also saw the same in the “Arnolfini Portrait”.

We've designed the nVision series of contour banders to accept a wide range of replacement or add-on options direct from the factory. Whether you need a vacuum pod to hold larger or odd-shaped parts, or a table to help band small parts, look to SNX first for a perfect fit and superior construction.
(UPDATED PRODUCT! 10-2017 SEE VIDEO>>) Sold separately. Great for very small part handling without using the articulated vacuum arm. The tables are made of high-grade phenolic (the same material as the vacuum pods) for durable performance. The banding table may be raised or lowered, depending on part thickness. The trimming table may be swung back and out of the way of the vacuum arm. When locked in front of the trimmers, the table retracts with the trimming station for large parts.
Need more glue capacity for your part production? SNX's contour edgebander can now be fitted with a larger 3kg glue pot that offers three times greater glue capacity than the standard pot. A 1000 watt, six-inch ring heater provides rapid melting and temperature control with the glue. The new glue pot is designed for consistent circulation of the melted glue to the auger. The pot is coated with Teflon for easier glue clean-up and pellet type changeover.
SNX offers a variety of standard and custom phenolic vacuum pods to match your production needs. From small circles to elaborate contour shaped pods, we can get you the exact pod you need to hold any part securely to the machine.

I started building Leap because I didn’t have a place on the internet where I felt comfortable talking openly. I’ve found that some conversations online escalate to shouting matches quickly and many people opt out, especially women. I wondered what would happen if I created a community where the core culture was set by women, and the software and product decisions were also made by women. I couldn’t think of a social network defined that way, but I wanted to be part of one.
I first started thinking about a community for women in 2014, when I attended the first Female Founders Conference, hosted by YC founder Jessica Livingston. The conference was one of the few times I can recall spending an afternoon with hundreds of smart, talented women working in my industry. At that time I had only a few female friends working in tech, and it was clear from the conference that there were many more of us than I realized. I was inspired by the number of impressive female founders YC had funded, the even larger network of female employees at YC companies, and the even broader community of women consuming YC content. So when I started working at YC as a software engineer, I knew I wanted to build this community for myself and other women in tech.
Leap members are discussing a broad range of topics – we’ve shared technical articles, startup questions, job opportunities, career connections, parenting issues and discussions about sexual harassment.
2. Even when members have opposing views, they’ve given each other the benefit of the doubt and continue to talk productively.
3. Members are building on and offline relationships; they’ve found jobs, met mentors and made friends through the community.
Please note that YC’s blog is still where Y Combinator will communicate with people about news and announcements specific to Y Combinator and the YC community.
Special thank you to Amy Buechler, Kat Manalac, Domonique Fines, Adora Cheung and Stephanie Simon for being my first users, and providing great feedback, advice and contributions to the community along the way.

I would like to know if we could write a python script to get a bond angle distribution for a selected particle types in ovito. I am interested in creating a histogram of bond angle distribution between certain particle types in my simulations.
Here is a script I wrote some time ago for Ovito 2.9.0 to calculate the bond-angle distribution for a system (for demonstration purposes). It may serve you as a starting point to develop a solution for your specific problem. Disclaimer: I never used the script for real-word analyses and I never verified that it is working correctly. So use with caution.
However, I am not sure how this can be interpreted. Would you please give some explanation about this?
concerning the error message: did you just copy that code in a python script modifier in the GUI of OVITO? Note that this is a bash-script which is meant to be executed from the command line like this:

Just two days ago Kate revealed her cocker spaniel pups name is 'Lupo' to a classroom of excited children at Rose Hill primary school. The little dog has clearly become a very special part of William and Kate's family. The Duchess was photographed taking a stroll with Lupo around the beautiful Kensington Gardens.
Kate was accompanied by a royal protection officer during her walk and the pair appeared to be enjoying a conversation.
Kensington Gardens is simply a beautiful place for a stroll. There are a number of attractions such as the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Playground and the Italian Statue.
Kate watched Lupo closely and appeared to be talking to him. Perhaps training him and teaching him some tricks? It should be noted Lupo is one adorably cute dog :)
Kate wrapped up in her L.K. Bennett Darwin Jacket, a tan sweater, light blue jeans and hat. I love her casual style and it's great to see her looking so relaxed and happy.
The Darwin jacket has been staple in Kate's wardrobe over the past number of months, She was photographed wearing it Christmas eve and leaving Richard Ward's salon a few weeks ago.
Kate also wore her Le Chameau Leather Lined Wellington Boots. This look appears to be Kate's 'go to' outfit while out and about.
Not sure, it looks different. Love your blog by the way! It is great and unique, I found it just a couple of days ago. Thank you for every day enjoyment!
ahh she look great and look happy I guess.. other guy it should be bodyguard??? Thank you fo the photos...
O my, she looks great! I secretly always think she is even more beautiful when she is just walking around town or taking a stroll... so natural!
Thank you for the pictures! I love your blog. Lupo has gotten so big since the last pictures and much cuter if that's possible
Such an adorable dog, I grew up with cocker spaniels in my family (our last one looked just like Lupo!) so I am partial to them. Kate looks great and those gardens are beautiful.
when it took photos???? someone it said from last monday not today?? but she has not take cut hair on monday next day on 21th she went a visit center. then took cut hair i am confused here the link http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20395222_20572957,00.html i think she look not get cut hair.. whag you think?
A smiling Kate headed out to Kensington Gardens on Monday for a stroll through the public park with her 4-month-old black cocker spaniel puppy. She wore a favorite shearling coat by LK Bennett and her Le Chameau Vierzonord boots over blue jeans.
these photos are great! it looks like her hair is just tucked into her jacket, but she SHOULD cut it that short! it looks so cute! (and even a little younger)
Has she complained about the photos yet? I don't understand the difference between pictures they accept to be taken and ones they don't like
Anonymous - As far as I know there have been no complaints at all about these photos yet I think it bothers William more.
The photos seem to have been taken on the 20th I do not think she cut her hair it's tucked behind her coat.
I agree with you Duchess Kate as far as the pictures bothering William. We have to remember the Prince is very protective of his Duchess. And he is not with her so I might not be to happy regarding these photos either. I would not blame him.
But the pictures were so cute. Let's just hope the her Prince will return soon to protect his Duchess. Thanks again for a great blog.
In some of these pictures it looks like she has her engagement ring on, and in others you can't see it! Strange. Love these photos thought, Lupo is to die for! So cute!
I want to see more of Lupo up close. They take pictures of all of the queen's corgis why not Lupo...SO CUTE

Oh, and i did found one miniature addition to the command-rule version of mp3gain, which is at this time version 1.4.four:for those who hint at the "-r" parameter ("apply track gain"), then mp3gain skips both "compact disk" processing. In previous models, if you had a number of mp3 files specified within the command reign, then mp3achieve you wished to do disc processing on all the recordsdata within the record.thanks to Len Trigg for stating how this newer method crafts more reveal, and even the exact code adjustments.
My part requires me to listen to music mostly lo rez mp3s both hours of daylight lengthy. Im a big advocate of the who cares relating to bitrate ideas, so long as we keep above 128. nevertheless enclosed track, I noticed the difference almost immediately.

The majority of the content here is pulled from the "STAGE MANAGER" clauses of various Equity rulebooks, to compile a list of what are and are not commonly the duties of a stage manager (this is in no way definitive, as not all contracts have the same wording), it's just to give a general idea.
The Stage Manager or Assistant Stage Manager shall be present in the rehearsal area and during all performances except in an emergency. The Theatre shall not require members of the Equity Stage Managerial staff to absent themselves from rehearsals or performances.
The Stage Manager or Assistant Stage Manager must be present on the deck or in communication from the booth with all backstage areas during all performances, run- throughs, technical rehearsals and dress rehearsals. Under no circumstances shall anyone other than the Stage Manager or Assistant Stage Manager be on book calling the cues of a production.
It is agreed that it is the duty of the Stage Manager to assemble and maintain the production script for the actual technical and artistic operation of the production and that the production script remains the property of the Theatre.
To monitor safety backstage and on stage, to check presets and supervise scene changes, and to assist and backup the Stage Manager.
Handling contracts, having riders signed or initialed, or from fulfilling any other function which normally comes under the duties of the General Manager or Company Manager (which shall not preclude delivery of a sealed envelope addressed to the individual Actor).
Signing the closing notice of the Company or the individual notice of termination of an Actor's contract (which shall not preclude posting of any closing notice and other permanent company notices).
Doing janitorial, custodial or building maintenance work as part of their Stage Managerial duties including securing and locking the theatre following performances or technical rehearsals.
Be responsible for any aspect of transportation or be responsible for the maintenance of any vehicle.
As implied by the rule against providing food for the company, it is not the job of the stage management team to provide coffee at rehearsal. It's just a nice thing to do, and most stage managers benefit from the presence of coffee as much, if not more than the actors. Mostly, though, it's just one of those things that not enough people have stood up and said, "That's not my job" about, and everyone assumes it is.
Stage management doesn't have to call half hour, places or anything else. It's a lot smarter to do so, rather than to trust everybody else to keep track of time. But if the calls aren't made, that doesn't mean it's not half hour, or that people shouldn't be ready to do their jobs by curtain time.

If the Police wanted the public to know the extent of the availability of illegal weapons in Samoa, they did a pretty good job last week.
With such a public show of the destruction of guns – including a prayer and all where the media was invited to film – the pictures have since been etched into people’s memories, not just in Samoa but all over the world.
A lot of those images and footages were immediately snapped up by some international news agencies that quickly made a big deal about how such a remote “island paradise” can have so many unregistered and illegal guns. It’s only natural that people will be surprised.
Why do you need a gun in paradise anyway? Unless you have something you want to protect? And even if that is the case, from what and who?
The downside of it of course was highlighted by the Police Commissioner, Fuiavailili Egon Keil, who lamented the inability of local law enforcement agencies to stop gun smuggling.
Indeed, that is the bigger issue and one where the focus of local relevant authorities should be directed. Urgently too. Samoa does not manufacture guns. It’s not something you can carve from a pulu tree or weave from a couple of coconut fronds. Guns are imported and there are supposed to be strict laws that should have stopped a lot of these weapons at our borders.
The fact that 285 illegal firearms were discovered by the Police during different raids tells us the obvious. That these laws are not working. Even more worrying is the fact that whoever is supposed to be enforcing and monitoring them, do not appear to be doing their job.
“We don’t make bullets as well or ammunitions, but these guns somehow find their way into our island and it’s not just Samoa, it’s other islands as well.
“You see an AK-47 here, we’ve got shot-rifles and hand-guns and then you think how it got into Samoa? Well it got in here somehow and there are lots of ways you can bring them into Samoa and obviously we are not doing our job as good as it should be.”
During the ceremony, Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sa’ilele Malielegaoi made a blunt point not many people had picked up. He said since there is only one reason these weapons exist and that is to protect marijuana plantations. He did not mince words and he was right.
The worry is that the weapons destroyed last week are the only ones that have been found. Dare we say the Police have only scratched the tip of the iceberg because we have reason to believe there are a lot more out there. This is why it’s important that an amnesty is decreed to still give people the opportunity to hand in these powerful weapons.
We live in Samoa where we don’t need these guns. Unless you want to declare war on the family or village next door, there is no need for them at all. The problem is that the law allows anybody who has a plantation to apply for a license, which is granted more often than not. Now if you have a decent plantation where you need a gun to scare off the wild pigs, then by all means you should get one.
But so many people are granted licenses to guns to protect their cabbage and vegetable garden in front of their lawn. This needs to be reviewed and relooked at.
As for getting to the bottom of the problem with such powerful weapons and how they are coming in, the Police Commissioner made a very valid point last week. Which is where they really need to tighten the screws.
“We need to cooperate also with other agencies and border agencies such as Immigration and Customs to make sure these weapons don’t come into our country,” he said. “Well we’ve got a lot of containers, cars and a lot of other avenues that can allow these weapons to come into our islands.”
He’s right. This has been happening ever since we can remember. It needs to stop if we are serious about keeping these weapons away from Samoa.
Here’s the thing though, wherever there are powerful firearms and ammunitions, you can pretty much guarantee that drugs, narcotics and other illegal activities are not far away.
We’d hate to think that this is why there are so many powerful and illegal guns in Samoa. What do you think? Write and share your thoughts with us!
While thousands of his followers have been asking of his whereabouts, MaiFM New Zealand has posted a story headlined: “DJ Khaled has reportedly been spotted laxing it up in Samoa!”
But it quotes social media posts by Samoa’s Brianna Fruean and shows photos of a private jet at Faleolo International Airport captured by Mele Maualaivao at the beginning of the week.
It’s hard to tell from the photos the hotel – if DJ Khaled – is indeed in Samoa. One of the theories is that he stopped by at Faleolo International Airport on his way to wherever he is.
The mystery of his whereabouts has deepened since DJ Khaled was supposed to have featured as one of the stars at the Wireless Festival in London.
Khaled Mohamed Khaled is an American record producer, radio personality, DJ, record label executive and author.
He was a radio host for the Miami-based urban music radio station WEDR "99 Jamz" and the DJ for the hip hop group Terror Squad.

I went a little while ago to Helsinki for a one day minitrip, but there it was filled with all kinds of things, because there was gonna be three meetups / events! Spent the night at Hämeenlinna, so don't have to leave early in the morning all the way from Tampere and at the same time got to see my sister and doggies. ♡
So the day had three thingies, first off Hello Con (helsinki lolita convention) organiser's meetup and taking pictures, then we went for a totally delicious brunch! I'm usually so cheap, that don't pay for such things, but now it was also my lunch and got my tummy nicely full for the next event, a photoshoot workshop. Hopped on to a tram at the center and headed towards arabia, for our facebook-group model's and photographer's own photoshoot workshop, the theme was post apocalyptic, which means thingies after end of the world. People were so tires, when most had been there already for 5-6 hours. I Had time to put on one outfit and take couple of pictures and hang out a bit, untill we put stuff together and was on the move again. Got some on-the-way-beers from the store and headed towards the city by tram to an alternative blogs-meetup at Praha. It was my first time at that bar and was a super suprise, a really nice rock bar! :D The name sounds like some fancy cafe, but it was actually something else..nice people, chill atmosphere and great music..well the beer was expencive, but what can you do at Helsinki city center.
Nintendo plans on selling the Mariners. I guess that they got tired of having to control a morbidly pathetic baseball franchise. Not sure how the new ownership will do once it becomes official but at least it isn't Clay Bennett buying the team.
I'm very happy this isn't how it's turned out so far. The Red Sox are looking pretty good right now. Obviously there's a LOT of baseball left to go but we're off to a good start.
Pretty crazy how the Lastros choked away that game against the most putrid division leader in baseball (as of the date of this post). I thought they would've been way better than this. Their terrible play is only slightly better than how I expected the Mariners to play so far this year.
F*cking Mariners. Losing 3 straight at home and being below .500 at home once again. Can't they just be a traveling road team at this point. They somehow have the 2nd best road record in the Majors at this time.
I'm going to see if I can observe meat-free Monday and still have fun at the ballpark. My options include:
It's almost June and the Mariners have lost twice as many games at home as they've lost on the road. This would be close to expectations of this team being bad if not for the fact that they somehow have the best road record in baseball. Not sure how they're able to win as many games to start the season as they have at this point, but it seems like so far this season they're the biggest overachievers and are due for a fall back to earth since out of all of the teams with the better records in baseball (not used to saying that), they are the most flawed team with the worst overall roster.
well it looks like my cousin is back on that Mariners. From what I read he was released by the Rangers, and the Mariners picked him up again...
Giolito is pitching tonight, about a mile away from where I am right now. I sort of "have to" go, don't I?
He's facing Matt Harvey. I saw Harvey pitch a few weeks ago. Nationals Park was about 25% filled with Mets fans there to support him, since he wasn't doing so well. The guy got pressured into pitching too many innings, too soon after Tommy John surgery. His velocity is way down, and this formerly dominant ace is getting hit hard, and it's sad. So the visiting fans chanted "Harrrrrr-veeeeeey!" as he warmed up, and when he first walked to the mound, and when he got his first strikeout. I thought it was embarrassing that there were all of these Mets fans, in OUR house, setting the tone.
He was pulled a few innings later, roughed up, a loser. I stood up and chanted, "Harrrrrr-veeeeey!". The people I was with thought that was really mean. Hey, isn't that was you're supposed to do at a game? Taunt the visiting team? As opposed to sitting back and letting the visiting team fans taunt YOUR team?
The stands in DC are really quiet and polite, most of the time. It's a little embarrassing, actually, it makes it look like we don't care. Well, I care! But I'm a quiet and polite person. I'm never going to be the one leading a cheer.
Going to a sporting event is expensive these days. The stands aren't filled with working class fans, being loud and abrasive and course. It's all people who have to get home early to tuck the kids in and get to work early to work on some super-important high-pressure task and they probably are checking their work e-mail on their phone all during the game. Things have changed.
I don't buy the whole Matt Harvey pitched too many innings last season criticism. To me it's a cop-out excuse and a cheap shot at the Mets organization.
So the Angels are continuing to show how pathetic they are only more so. Honestly at this point so long as both Scioscia and Moreno are around I don't know if this team even deserves to be good (and I'm positive they won't be). Of course Arte won't sell the team anytime soon and Scioscia will continue to stick around at least until his contract is up. Guess I should get used to the Angels being the joke of the AL West.
F*cking Mariners falling back down to earth after their inexplicable early season run of pretending to be a good team. Time to sell off all of the so-called talent on this team still because this team reminds me of the Florida Marlins team (pre- Miami Marlins days) a few years back that were hot until June and then died. If the M's are going to be that level of atrocious the rest of the way, they might as well trade Seager, Cruz, and all of their established pitchers including dare I say King Felix (the M's are stuck with Cano's absurd contract). Maybe that will get them something to work with as far as a farm system goes until GM Shamwow Guy screws that part up.
Tread deadline came and went. Other than trading Wade Miley for a used diaper, the M's stood pat. As for the miley trade, not sure who won but considering that it's the M's making a trade, I'd say they lost the trade.
Not sure why the Mets signed failed NFL qb and fanatical religious zealot Tim Tebow to a minor league contreact. This seems like a move the Mariners would've made if Jack Z was still the GM.
It's truly a delight having Trea Turner up with the big club (Nationals). Harper is an amazing player but he's a punk. Trea is all smiles and enthusiasm and his incredible speed is literally a game-changer. The facet that I didn't anticipate: fielders have to rush plays, knowing that he'll wind up being safe if they don't hustle, and that has led directly to a few errors.
Playoffs are here. Toronto beat the Oreoles and the Giants beat the Mets in the play-in Wild Card games.
I guess that could have something to do with the community being less active overall as there are people I no longer see here that used to post in this thread.
The Cleveland name + mascot aren't nearly as gross as the Washington football team but it still makes me flinch (and makes my wife FURIOUS). They are the spunky underdog to most people (and the players are easy to root for) but I will be deeply disappointed / annoyed if they win.
I like the theory that Buck Showalter just conned every other playoff team into over-extending their closers for the past month, and now the Orioles will swoop in and win it all next year when every other bullpen shows up next year with dead arms.
no longer lovable losers, it's now okay to hate the Cubbies. next world series win is scheduled in the year 3535, if man is still alive
That still is sooner than the Seattle Mariners making their first World Series appearance. With the current baseball format, they'll accidentally make (and lose) the play in wild card game once or twice between now and then. (Might as well take that losers title from the Cubs now since the M's are one of 2 teams to never reach a world series and theiy didn't have the 94 strike eliminate their shot like the Expos/Natinals did.)
Also, congrats to the Cubs fans though they should've done the World Series with Will Farrell as Harry Carey doing all of the game commentary, possibly side by side with Bob Uecker as Harry Doyle from Major League. Such a missed opportunity considering the teams in the world series this year.
Speaking of trades, The Mariners have traded Taijuan Walker to Arizona for a scrap heap of players in a trade that will come back to haunt the M's.
I'm trying to deploy 8.5.1 multi-server in my test environment. I get the link from the downloads page, start the deploy OVF template in the end of puppet master showing the error please find the attachment.
Is IP address of the puppetmaster server one that can get out to the internet? Since the appliance does not allow for any basic reconfiguring before it starts it's setup, you need to make sure that the VM will get an IP address that is allowed out to the internet. For us, that meant opening the VM's settings and getting the MAC address, then assigning a reservation in out DHCP server prior to powering the appliance VM up for the first time.
Thanks For quick replay yes puppetmaster server can get out to the internet after restart the puppet master server and run puppet agent -t commend it is show some other error Please see the attachment.
This issue is caused by the time difference. VMware host sets time app. 5:15 ahead of NTP (this can be also seen on the screenshot where it says that run took negative value of -18844.45). Installation is interrupted because certificate is not valid when it has future creation value. Either VMware host or NTP is wrong, no matter of timezones.
I've put together a small show for this year (first year using LOR). It consists of 2 animation sequences and 1 musical sequence. I've added all these to the show in Show Editor, and then I've set the schedule to play this show. Here's where the issue comes in:
At the prescribed time, the show begins to play, however, it only plays the musical sequence over and over again. It won't play either of my animation sequences, so it just repeats the same 3-minute song over and over again. Am I doing something wrong? The control panel log even says "starting animation..." but the next line says "Loading compressed sequence" and then "Starting Musical." It's as if it just skips over the animations.
I have the two animation sequences under the “Animations” tab and the musical sequence under the “Musical” tab. I only have the basic license version, so I can’t even use the other tabs at this point.
Do you have anything in the shutdown tab? I think you need a sequence in there ( even a couple seconds of silence/darkness ), if you don't I'm guessing that's why it keeps playing your musical sequence over and over.
Are you using your animations to " fill in " in between shows? If so then you should have two separate shows created to use in the scheduler. I don't think you can have it included with your musical unless that's part of your show. Once you've set your start times for your musical then it will always cancel the animation sequence and start the musical show.
No. You do not need anything in the shutdown tab. Note that as the OP stated with his Basic level license, he can't use the shutdown tab.
You can mix animation (LAS) and musical (LMS) in the same show on the Musical Tab. When you click the Add button, you just need to change the file type to LAS in the dropdown at the bottom right of the Select dialog.
Over the last few months I have been co-chair for organizing a fund raising event, with all proceeds going to help find a cure for Battens disease.
In short Battens disease is rare but progressively devastating to those afflicted by it. Within a very short timeframe it robs the person of their senses and cognitive abilities.
The website www.beatingbatten5k.com provides more information about the disease and also some insight on what its like for families living with it.
The event is a 5K run in Staunton, VA October 20th followed by a silent auction. Now if traveling some distance to run a 5k doesn't appeal to you, we also offer the option to donate money.

A Buggered Wreath of Quartz did hold the back of power, a sway to hind, a man too few, and so came forth a Bedraggled corpse.
Supine in the midst of all chaos and brine, a reach of mirth did affect the swine. Swine have taken to the floral front, companions and compassion for the state of Now and Nowhere.
A good few men and far too few women are writing the same thing, a little verse of what may be. So say I, the eye of the world which could be. "Grow and make a great corpus for the future! The dawn of eternity is here, and y'all spoil yourselves for a sucrine moment of time, when before you lays the love of creation."
Animals: Procedural. So is the gift of Hyperion to Nyx, a couple people, a couple friends. Blossoming and growing into a gene which carries itself upon the banks of time to a procedural future, upon which the wreath of the bedraggled quartz lies. Be now not sure, be now not aware of what may be, a hope for enlightened glory, enlightened promise of that promise and privilege to be among the greatest and most important gift of Hyperion to Nyx. A true love. A true friend. A true gift from narrative to chaos.
Challenging your assumptions is good for your health, good for your business, and good for your future. Stay skeptical but never undervalue the importance of a new and unfamiliar perspective.
.. and my sleep-addled brain read it as corpse.. and my eyes rolled into my head and asked "wtf brain!?"
I don't actually understand Hyperion's story, and I've read it a few times trying to figure it out. It sounds nice - the words go together like a sort of poetry - but the meaning is difficult to discern, and I feel like that may be how it was intended.
besides keys, cell phone and wallet/cash/CC/ID, what else do you carry with you most of the time, like when you go to work, or when you go out shopping, talk a walk, etc.
Wow, newton, you named it!! That, and a little old fashioned Captain Kangaroo "please" and "Thank you".

Hardly anything at all from that list. Maybe a camera, occasionally, and sometimes a GPS if I'm driving in unfamiliar territory. Certainly not items I would take with me every day.

I always carry a backpack that contains my wallet, a Panasonic point and shoot and my iPad. I used to carry a diary and small notebook but the iPad covers that better now as well as being a GPS.

The two women who helped alter the course of American legal history by staging an impromptu protest in a Washington elevator have said they were driven by memories of private trauma and inspired by the courage of Dr Christine Blasey Ford. Ana Maria Archila and Maria Gallagher of New York loudly berated Senator Jeff Flake for planning to back Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination to the supreme court on Friday, influencing him to alter his view and call for an FBI investigation, which the White House then ordered.

We were contacted in October 2010 by Ryan Keller, owner of Oakland Structures, requesting a website for his business. He was looking for something that would give people a easy place to look at the multitudes of options available with buildings. He wasn’t interesting in being able to sell products on-line; but to profile products, and have very clear examples of his products.

What a beautiful, cedar-sided home this is! We started by stripping it down completely with bio-friendly chemicals and gentle power washing – so as not to damage the wood. It was then stained with Sikkens oil-based stain.
This was a very challenging, yet rewarding project. We were privileged to be a part of bringing new life to this house of worship. Along with painting, we also had to complete some “renovations” to some of the old cedar shakes. (more…)

Not the sort of film that I would normally see, but definitely worth checking out if you’re interested in something that is both different and also very good
The film was deliberately paced. I wasn’t checking my watch or phone- I couldn’t take my eyes off the movie screen.
I have never really wanted a sequel to a dramatic/independent movie before- until now. Apparently the novel doesn’t end where the film ends; it continues and picks up with Elio and Oliver 15-20 years later.
I think that the movie needs the time to build the charakters of Elio and Oliver up. So it would be not good when the movie would be 20 minutes shorter. Of course the pace is slow, but this is not a problem. I have more issues with the time in the movie. It is sometimes not comprehensibly what time is it in the movie. The story is about 6 weeks in the movie. 6 weeks are such long, but I can't say often, how many days or weeks are gone at this moment in the movie. Because the love-situation is of course a process which goes over a period of time. So TIME is a important think.
Saw the movie with my boyfriend and wow it was amazing the dad scene made me cry. It was a beautiful movie
Nice review!! One thing I recommend for you is switching up that intro. It’s confusing for people watching your videos for the first time and it’s way too long. Keep intros to 3-4 seconds
i love the film…best time i had in a cinema in years…i had a different feeling tho…by the time the film ended i wanted to see more!!!..i wouldnt mind spending another hour there just watching more of these characters….at least we´re getting a sequel in 2020

If you’re trying to open a Dictionary in Panorama X via the ScriptEditor, Panorama X does not even show as a choice.
I’m not sure how much difference that ultimately makes, but Panorama X and AppleScript do work together already. I’ve got quite a few AppleScripts active and working just fine.
Panorama X has great support for invoking AppleScripts, in other words, using AppleScripts to control other programs from Panorama.
Panorama X currently has zero support for being scriptable, in other words, other applications cannot control Panorama X thru a script. That will probably change eventually, but it is on a very low priority track. When it does become scriptable, there will probably be only one verb, execute.
If you have the code to be executed in the .Initialize procedure of the file that opens you could have the Finder open the file (and Panorama if not already open) and then the file’s .Initialize procedure will execute the code and quit. You could use a script like this adjusted to your particulars:
The file’s .Initialize procedure would do the rest directly or call the other procedures including quitting Panorama when finished. Just a thought, don’t know if it fills the bill and it would work right now.

Third Circuit Affirms Award of Damages in Misappropriation of Trade Secrets Case and Denial of Recovery on Injunction Bond After Employee’s Partial Success on Appeal | California Employment Lawyer
The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s award of damages against employees on a claim brought by their former employer for, inter alia, misappropriation of trade secrets. Latuszewski v. Valic Financial Advisors, Inc., No. 08-1511, 2010 WL 3582434 (3rd Cir. Sept. 15, 2010). Former employer, VALIC Financial Advisors, Inc., bought claims against former employees Gary Latuszewski and James Rogan alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, misappropriation of trade secrets, and tortious interference with contract. Id. *1. Employees appealed arguing that this award was in error and also that the District Court erred in declining to award them damages under VALIC’s injunction bond after this court vacated part of the District Court’s temporary injunction against them. Id.
VALIC sells and services financial products and required the Employees to sign new employment contracts that included a non-compete covenant and a provision preventing the Employees from using VALIC trade secrets for any purpose other than their work. Id. About a year after the Employees signed the new contracts, they resigned from VALIC to join a company created by Latuszewski called North Atlantic Asset Management, which directly competed with VALIC. Id. Some of the Employees’ clients at VALIC moved their accounts to North Atlantic. Id. The Employees filed a declaratory judgment action in state court to resolve their contractual obligations under the non-compete and trade secrets provisions. VALIC removed to federal court and filed counterclaims for breach of contract, tortious interference with contract, misappropriation of trade secrets, and breach of fiduciary duty. Id. VALIC also moved for a preliminary injunction to enforce the non-compete covenant and to stop the Employees’ misappropriation of trade secrets. Id. The District Court issued an injunction, which in part required VALIC to post a $500,000 bond.
The District Court held a bench trial and found the Employees liable on each of VALIC’s counterclaims. Id. *2. The District Court found that the Employees had used customer information from VALIC’s proprietary databases to create a list of the Employees’ clients with accounts that could easily be moved to a new firm, and that the Employees contacted those clients and invited them to do so. Id.
The District Court held that the “customer lists, account balances, account activity, financial objectives, investment preferences, and transfer details, including penalties” in VALIC’s databases comprised trade secrets. Id. In a former appeal, the Third Circuit concluded that “the District Court properly held that the information described in the preliminary injunction constituted protectable trade secrets.” Id. (citing Latuszewski v. Valic Fin. Advisors, Inc., 2005 WL 1367809, *1 (3d Cir. June 9, 2005)). The court concluded that the “Employees have pointed to nothing to convince us to deviate from our earlier decision.” Id.
The Employees argued that the District Court erred in finding that they used any trade secrets in a way that harmed VALIC. Id. The District Court found that the Employees used trade secret customer information to compile lists, including mental lists, of those customers who would be targeted for transfer, that the Employees personally contacted at least some of those VALIC customers to invite them to move their money, and that at least some of those individuals did so. Id. The Third Circuit affirmed, holding that “[t]hese findings were not clearly erroneous, and it is evident that the Employees’ actions constitute a breach of confidence that harmed VALIC.” Id.
The Employees also argued that because part of the injunction was vacated on a prior appeal, they are entitled to recover on the injunction bond. Id. *3. The court held that “Here, the Employees were wrongfully enjoined only from servicing those clients who wished to transfer or did transfer their funds to North Atlantic, and who were not solicited through the use of VALIC’s trade secrets.” Id. The District Court found that the Employees failed to sufficiently prove that the vacated portion of the injunction caused them any damages. Id.
The Third Circuit affirmed the denial of recovery on the injunctino bond, holding that the “Employees’ failure to present sufficient and particularized evidence as to the extent, if any, to which they actually suffered damages as a result of the vacated portion of the injunction is dispositive.” Id.
Circuit Judge Dolores Korman Sloviter wrote the opinion for the court. Circuit Judges Maryanne Trump Barry and D. Brooks Smith concurred.
On appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, (D.C. No. 03-cv-00540), District Judge: Honorable Gary L. Lancaster.

The VF-4 Lightning III fighter was developed in late 2009 as the "next generation" variable fighter for the UN Spacy. The VF-4 was faster, more maneuverable, could generate more thrust than the standard VF-1 Valkyrie, and was armed with dual beam cannons.
The VF-4 primary weapons became two large beam cannons, though the craft is capable of carrying a GU-11 gun pod in GERWALK and Battroid modes. The VF-4 was only slightly heavier than the VF-1, but featured considerably more powerful engines making the craft ideal for operations deeper out in space.
Early models of the VF-4, designated VF-X-4 Prototypes, were produced on Earth for testing purposes in 2010. The VF-X-4 prototypes were heavily based on the VF-1 Valkyrie design; 35% of the VF-X-4's components were directly taken from the VF-1 Valkyrie, including the entire nose and forward fuselage section.

The inception for this vision stemmed years ago, when he worked with his uncle – a paramedic – during ambulance runs. He was fascinated by the "interventions that would have a direct impact on patient lives."
"Ever since then, I wanted to go into medicine. I went to Emergency Medical Technician school and worked as an EMT for five years," he says enthusiastically. "You're saving a life and you see the results right there."
He admits this impact created a fascination for Cardiothoracic surgery (heart surgery), which first led Mike to the Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies & Master of Public Health at Touro University California.
"Not many programs offer the dual degree program like at Touro," he states. "Once I came across this program, I knew it would be good to pursue."
But the Denver-born, drum-playing student didn't stop there. His passion to make a difference among patients propelled Mike to pursue his dream and in May, was accepted to the Physician Assistant Postgraduate Cardiothoracic Surgical Residency at Emory University in Atlanta, Ga.
"It's incredible . . . They only accept one resident into this program." he declares, who incidentally also declined an offer from Yale University. "This is very exciting for me!"
Mike credits part of his success to TUC's rotation program, which helped solidify his decision to pursue Cardiothoracic surgery. As part of the program at Touro, students must complete nine rotations. And of these, he says, it was his trip to Ethiopia that left the biggest impact.
"I participated in a research project with one of my classmates and looked at self-treatment practices of patients with Malaria," he recollects. "We found they like to use garlic in food or rubbed over the body to help with symptoms."
But the determined student went a step further. He spent quality time with the locals by visiting their homes, sharing cups of coffee, and playing soccer at the local park.
"They were really good players. It was interesting to see how some kids had shoes, some had sandals, and some played barefoot," Mike recalls and adds, "The ball was stuffed with hay to prevent it from being flat. They don't' have the funds to buy a needle to pump air."
As a way of helping the community, Mike and the remaining Touro students combined their funds and together, purchased medical supplies for the local clinic.
A student can earn two master degrees in 32 months: A Master of Science in Physician Assistant Studies and a Master of Public Health. The integration of these two professions means that in their clinical practice, TUC alums are trained to see both the individual and the community in which they live.

In the early 1950s the Red Army had 30 divisions based in Germany. What were the Soviets up to? Did they plan to invade Western Europe? British and American efforts to answer these questions had been stymied by their inability to crack the Russian military and diplomatic codes. The British and Americans desperately desired information that would provide an early warning of any Soviet attack. They devised an audacious plan to get it. They would build a quarter-mile-long tunnel from Berlin’s American sector to the city’s Soviet sector and tap into the underground telephone cables that carried conversations to and from Soviet military headquarters.
CIA Director, Allen Dulles, approved the top-secret plan in January 1954. It would be a joint CIA and British SIS operation. Work began immediately. Cover was provided by building a new facility next to a Berlin airport close to the dividing line between the American and Soviet sectors. Disguised as a radar installation, it provided the starting point for the tunnel and a hidden dumping ground for all the dirt created by the excavation.
By May 1955 the tunnel was completed and the Russian cables containing an estimated 1200 telephone lines were tapped. It was a mother-lode of information that kept 650 translators and analysts based in Washington and London busy around the clock for the next three years.
It was not to last. In the spring of 1956 heavy rains inundated Berlin saturating the earth and interrupting the service of a number of cables. In the early morning hours of April 22, 1956 the American spies watching from their disguised location were horrified to see a team of German workers digging directly above their tunnel. Within hours the tap was discovered and the listening devices shut down.
But, was the discovery the result of a freak accident of Nature? What the CIA and SIS didn’t know, or even suspect, was that their plan had been compromised from its very beginning. A "mole" had infiltrated the SIS. His name was George Blake and he had been recruited as a Soviet spy while he was being held prisoner during the Korean War. After his repatriation, Blake joined the SIS and assigned to the team developing the tunnel. He reported the plan to his KGB masters even before ground was broken. However, the murky world of international espionage often works in strange ways. It was discovered after the collapse of the Soviet Union that the KGB never revealed the existence of the tunnel to their military comrades for fear that closing down the operation might alert their American and British adversaries to the existence of a mole within their ranks.
In 1968 the CIA wrote an "after action" report of the Berlin Tunnel operation code-named PBJOINTLY. We join the CIA report as American agents listen to a microphone hidden in the "tap chamber" where the underground Soviet cables have been spliced into:
"At approximately 0050 hours on 22 April, 40 or 50 men were seen on the east side of Scboenefelder Allee, deployed along the entire area observable from our installation, digging at three to five foot intervals over the location of the cable and, incidentally, the tap chamber.
. . . At approximately 0200 hours the top of the tap chamber was discovered, and at 0210 Russian speech was heard from the microphone in the tap chamber. The first fragments of speech indicated that the discovery of the tap chamber aroused no suspicion among those present. A small hole was broken in the tap chamber roof permitting limited visual observation of the chamber, and a Soviet captain was brought to the spot. After some discussion all agreed that the discovery was a manhole covering a repeater point, and the working crew began enlarging the hole to gain access to the 'repeater point.'
. . . The work of excavation continued, and fragments of conversation connected with it were picked up by the tap chamber microphone. . . .A German remarked that the chamber might be connected with sewage work and proposed that plans of the sewage system be obtained. . . The Russian answered that they already had this information and the plans showed ‘that chamber’ to be 120 meters away from this point. At about 0320 hours, when still more of the tap chamber was revealed and a better view of the interior obtained, those present began to speculate vaguely about its exact nature and the time of its construction . . . Shortly after 0330 hours, the Soviets left the site by motor vehicle, presumably to report their findings.
At approximately 0415 hours Vyunik [Colonel Vyunik, Chief of the Soviet signal center in Berlin] telephoned Alpatov’s apartment [Major Alpatov, a KGB officer] and asked Alpatov if he had spoken with General Dudakov [Chief signal Officer of the GSFG]. Alpatov said that he had, that he was getting dressed, and that he would go to his signal center as soon as possible. Vyunik told Alpatov to telephone him at the GSFG frame room as soon as possible. Adding, 'When we speak we must do so carefully. We know what the matter is, so will speak carefully.' This indicated clearly that by 0415 hours the GSFG Signal Directorate and General Dudakov, the Chief Signal Officer, had been informed of the discovery of the PBJOINTLY chamber, viewed it with extreme suspicion, and planned to re-route circuits passing over the target cables.
. . . Between 0700 and 0800 hours a number of additional Soviet officers arrived at the excavation, including Colonel Gusev of the KGB Signals Regiment. A Russian-speaking German was heard to remark that a 'commission' was expected, and a Soviet officer said that they would await the arrival of this commission before making a decision as to what the next step would be.
. . . At approximately 1145 hours one of the German crew was heard to exclaim, 'The box is an entry to a shaft!'
. . . the Germans. . .broke a hole 'through the wall and gained visual access to the equipment chamber, which they described as a long passage.' By 1300 they evidently had enlarged the access hole and described 'a complete installation – a telephone exchange. . . An installation for listening in.'
Conversations reflected that all present realized that the planning of the tunnel approach to the cables must have necessitated a very detailed study of relevant maps and plans.
. . . One of the Germans rather indignantly exclaimed, 'What a filthy trick. And where you would least expect it.' To which another relied, 'Unless one had seen it for himself, nobody would believe it.'
Between 1515 and 1530 hours the tap wires were cut, and at about 1545 the attention of the Germans began to concentrate on the microphone itself. . .At 1550 hours work began on dismantling the microphone. Shortly afterward the microphone went dead and, after 11 months and 11 days, the operational phase of PBJOINTLY was completed."
The plan for the Berlin Tunnel was based on an earlier, but less ambitious, tunnel the British had built in Vienna in the late 1940s. The Vienna tunnel ran between the British and Soviet sectors of the city.
At the beginning of the operation, the Americans and British theorized that if discovered, the Soviets would not reveal the tunnel out of embarrassment. They were wrong. Two days after their discovery, the Soviets called in western reporters to inspect the tunnel. The British and Americans denied any involvement. However, the reporters discovered the following label on the water pumps used in the tunnel: "Goulds Pumps, Seneca Falls, NY."
The Soviet spy George Blake was exposed in 1961. Convicted of espionage, he was sentenced to 42 years in prison. He escaped from prison in 1966 and fled to Russia where he still lives today.

It is well worth a stop. There's a small archway that covers a footpath (steps) down to the chapel and the more modern hydro-electric plant. The chapel is beautiful.......but there's over 200 steps back up (something I regretted due to a back injury !!). It's worth the effort though as it gives you a much better idea of how huge the gorge really is. I like to sit and bird watch...if you are really lucky (as we were last year) you might see a Lammergeier or European Vulture (long finger like feathers at the end of the wings) but there are always eagles and a range of other local birds. Just the sun on the rocks can be lovely...great for photos. Not so good if you don't like heights. Try it !
We stopped for a 'proper' look for the first time in twenty years this May. Fantastic displays by the Lammergeiers and some smaller raptors, pigeons rather sensibly sticking to the base of the gorge! My wife eventually dragged me away but I could have watched all day.
Saw a young Golden Eagle here also a couple of years ago. I have seen images of these things but the reality is so much more striking - their wings are huge!

Mike Sokol turned me on to this because we recently received a call about a DI's ground wire blown up when connected between a mixer and a powered speaker. The speaker was connected to an outlet that had been recently converted from 2 to 3 prong and obviously wired with a reverse polarity bootleg ground. They told me they had checked it with a 3-light outlet tester which of course said it was wired OK.
And when you have a reverse polarity bootleg ground, measuring from neutral to ground with a meter as suggested earlier will NOT show any voltage, and measuring from hot (which is really now neutral) to ground will measure 120 volts . . . except the ground is the one at 120 volts! So the meter test doesn't help and the three-light tester can't be trusted by itself if it tests an outlet as OK..
The gold standard method for testing is to run a wire to the ground stake ouside the building, but NOBODY will do that. The easiest way is to use a $20 non-contact tester such as a Fluke VoltAlert to confirm if the ground pin is indeed at earth potential. As for a safety issue, it will indeed kill you if you plug a guitar amp into a RPBG (Reverse Polarity Bootleg Ground) and your PA system is connected to a properly grounded outlet. Your guitar amp will operate perfectly fine until you touch the microphone with your lips while your hand is on the strings. And "only" 120 volts can certainly kill you. So don't take chances.... get a non-contact AC tester and use it to confirm that your guitar amp and/or PA system aren't electrified. Here's a video of me electrifying a 40 foot RV trailer with 120 volts. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8h64X33aKg You'll note there's no visual warning that the entire RV and tow vehicle is now at 120 volts and will kill you if you stand on the ground and touch the stairs at the same time. This could just as easily be a tour bus, so a non-contact tester will confirm if your tour bus power hookup is safe as well as your stage power hookups.
Whether it was a hot/ground swap or the ground is bonded to the neutral at the receptacle, the ground would still be energized and could cause the issue, right? Would there be an acceptable method to test using a multimeter as compared to visual inspection?
It would be cool if the OP could get the venue to check out what actually is the problem, especially because damage was incurred on his equipment.

okay thanks for the explanations. i'm still trying to understand all this so I'll take a couple of reads before I ask any technical questions.
1) I definitely feel obligated to inform the reception hall. Our liaison came in when she saw all the smoke and asked if everything was okay. She didn't seem to think it was serious since nobody spoke to me afterwards. If I'm the first to get this problem, I won't be the last. How should I go about this? I have a feeling it might just get brushed by.
2) I didn't get to test my gear yet (the EQ which the heated cable was connected to). Is there any damage I should inspect? My snake seemed to work fine, but would the heat cause any damage (other channels, the box, etc.)
3) So seeing that the channel with the EQ was the only one frying, it was probably the outlet the rack was connected to? If that's the case, how come none of the other stuff connected heated? the mixer and rack was connected to same outlet
A hot-ground swap will cause the 3-light outlet tester to show red, warning you that the ground is hot. But a RPBG (Reverse Polarity Bootleg Ground) will appear to be wired properly using a 3-light outlet tester. And it will meter as correctly wired using a voltmeter as well. Even a $300 GLIT (Ground Loop Impedance Tester) like I use in my proof-of-concept video will not recognize a RPBG outlet. The only way to know for sure is to reference the earth itself by using a non-contact tester which capacitively couples to the earth via your body, or run a wire to known good ground (vice grips on a cold water pipe in the basement).
I'm pitching the idea of adding the VoltAlert test to the NFPA 70E National Electrical Code. This should be performed on EVERY outlet in any facility that had strange power problems. It only takes one RPBG outlet to trash your sound system.
BTW: I have a new test I've developing that will predict ground loop induced hum without having to plug in a single piece of audio gear. More fun!!!!
Ask Al Keltz from Whirlwind to post pictures of an IMP-2 DI box and an active audio distro that were hooked up to RPBGs. We did autopsies of the gear and found that the internal grounding wires were fried and circuit board traces vaporized. Funny thing is, those grounds operated as a very expensive fuse, and the audio transformer of the IMP-2 could still pass audio even though its ground wire was melted. Also note that something like an IMP-2 can be plugged between two pieces of gear with different chassis potentials (one grounded and the other at 120 volts due to a RPBG) and operate perfectly as long as the ground-lift switch is in the lift position. If you ground the switch, the box will basically blow up right in your hands.
I had a bass player friend of mine that this actually happened. He was at a church and they "grabbed" power from various outlets and when he plugged in the DI to his amp-the whole thing went up in his hands-along with other wires melting on the snake and so forth.
Glad no one was hurt. What would be the perfect storm for that to happen, someone being hurt by this I mean?Touching a rack rail while grounded?
whether it's a stove and a refrigerator or a guitar and a mike a "perfect storm" would be both plugged into hot grounds of opposite phase for a whopping 208 or 240 volts passing through your heart at 60 time a second U.S.A. (55 times a second at higher voltage abroad)
Yes, possible... but pretty unlikely. However, that would make for a VERY serious meltdown if it did occur on a live gig. I could easily mock that up on my test bench for a "really beeg shew"....
Here's a picture of the IMP-2 that Al Keltz from Whirlwind sent me. Note the blown "fuse" which was actually the grounding wire connected between the chassis and pin-1 on the XLR via the ground lift switch. We're both 99% sure it was caused by a powered monitor wedge plugged into a RPBG stage outlet. The sound guy actually tried this TWICE after burning up the first box and monitor using a second active monitor wedge new out of the box. So they blew up two active monitors and a small digital board totaling around $6K I guess. Fluke Voltalert would have been a lot cheaper.... For those who missed it earlier in the thread, here's the video of me testing for RPBGs (Reverse Polarity Bootleg Grounds). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pwCY4_LwJo&feature=youtu.be&noredirect=1
FYI: I have an entire test rig I built that lets me introduce up to 40 amps ground loop current and 120 volts AC electrification into any mixer, amp, speaker, mic or refrigerator. Al Keltz has seen me do this demonstration at the Whirlwind office in Rochester, and it's really cool to watch all the engineers step back from the table when I crank a mixer and microphone up to 120 volts bias, and there's no sparks, hums, or buzzes. But the VoltAlert will beep and light up from 4 to 6 inches away from the mic.
Rode the bridge today (Friday), and was surprised to find that the west deck was open to bikes as if today was a weekend or holiday. Chatted with a bike cop and he said they are opening it on days close to holidays. This is something I wholeheartedly support, and am glad to see. Looked on the bridge web site and could not find any details (such as what days it will be open), so guess we have to go by the signage.
That would be cool. What is the reasoning behind closing that side anyway? Seem safer to separate cyclists from pedestrians. I'm guessing less maintenance?
On safety, I remember seeing a report a while back that said they have more injuries when the west deck is open than when bikes and pedestrians share the east deck. Likely more incidences and annoyances when we share, but all the pedestrians around force us to be slow, so less injuries.

This may sound like a stretch because examples of industrial biotechnology applications usually imply, well, industrial uses of IB. But the definition of industrial biotechnology allows for a wide range of applications due to the fact that it simply states that it uses microorganisms to generate (useful) products. Subsequently, a large range of examples exist where little bugs are used to produce goods – many of which may surprise you.
Alternative power sources have gained more and more momentum with the emergence of wind, solar and hydrothermal generation but less expected is power generation from bacteria. Start-up project plant-e illustrates how bacteria contained in the soil next to plant roots can light up cat’s eyes and other road-marking lighting, such as on roundabouts. Microbial fuel cells are promising candidates in the unusual power generation category because by using bacteria they can enable power production from … pee, or any other organic material for that matter.
Other promising newcomers in the industrial biotechnology field are microalgae. Solazyme is a company which built its business all around them to produce valuable algal oils. These unicellulars grow on any biomass, ranging from corn and corn stover to waste streams, and fermentation speeds up their oil-production by up to 80%. The outlets for these renewable oils are manifold; they can even serve as biobased dielectric insulating fluids for transformers and many other types of electrical equipment.
But IB can go even further: scientists believe they can relieve your car’s shock absorbers by bringing an end to potholes thanks to a concrete blend which contains encapsulated bacteria. These are liberated when exposed to water and immediately produce limestone to fill up (road) cracks and avoid them developing into potholes. The possibilities are endless!

A precipitous fall a U.S. dollar will make U.S. exports cheaper and U.S. imports more a lot of money. Consequently, the U.S. will have inflationary growth, while export-led economies can have slower growth or recessions.

So, export-led economies will lose in the U.S. bond market. If those economies shift into U.S. stocks or physical assets, they’ll pay policies. The adjustment is inevitable, whether it requires place slowly or eventually.

Farmers have an important job—an essential one. Without farmers, how would we get our food? Granted, some of us are fortunate enough to have the space in our backyard to grow crops that could sustain our families for the year (we love backyard and office farming, by the way). Most of us, though, don’t have the space. And even if we did, we would be limited to a very small selection of crops. Food diversity is made possible because of our famers. It’s easy to forget that the food we put in our mouth has a source– a story. We forget that there’s a person on the other end of every delicious fruit, nut, seed and vegetable that we enjoy. Who is that person? What’s their life like? Are they using farming practices that will ensure future soil fertility? Do they have kids? Are they making a fair wage? We wanted to know more.

Please take comfort in knowing that we do not use monkeys to harvest our coconuts.

Advocacy groups have put a face on autism. They've helped us understand the science behind diagnoses and strategies. Though these figures are important, most people don't know what it's like to live with autism. This panel brings together the voices of individuals or family members that live with autism.
Join us with guest moderator, Senator Joe Robach, on December 5th from 6:30-8:30 PM as we share stories and experiences of what it's like to live with autism, from feelings of loneliness and despair, struggling to make and keep friends, to happiness and unbridled pride in talents that come with having autism.
Featuring speakers on the Spectrum and family members along with industry providers, Greg Benoit of Gates Public Library, Wade Richards of Spectrum Creative Arts, Jenny Brongo of Homestead for Hope, and Michael Nersinger of Artists Unlimited.
Set to address a joint session of Congress and the nation tonight, President Bush will unveil his $1.95 trillion FY 2002 budget, including a 10-year, $1.6 trillion tax cut package -- a proposal that Democrats have criticized as "too much money to the rich at the expense of social programs" such as Medicare, USA Today reports (Hall, USA Today , 2/27). Democrats say that Bush's plan "does not add up" and would "raid the surpluses" in Medicare and Social Security for tax cuts (Caruso/Norton, CongressDaily/A.M. , 2/27). "He's treated this federal budget like a giant shell game," Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) said (Hutcheson, Philadelphia Inquirer , 2/27). Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) added that Bush should "get off the campaign kick" and "scale back" his tax cut to provide additional funding for other initiatives, including a Medicare prescription drug benefit ( USA Today , 2/27). "You have to be willing to change direction when you're headed over a cliff," Reid said (Milbank, Washington Post , 2/27). In addition, some Democratic governors also criticized Bush's tax cut. Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening (D) said, "[S]ome of us are very concerned that the tax cut ... is too large and will not permit funding for some key issues, such as education and prescription drug coverage" (Allen/Balz, Washington Post , 2/27).
Despite the criticism, Bush said that his "common sense" budget package will serve as "a blueprint for new beginnings" in America. "I readily concede some appropriators may not like the fact that we're asking there to be fiscal sanity in the federal budget, but that's one of the reasons I became president," he added ( USA Today , 2/27). According to a Washington Post /ABC News poll released yesterday, Bush's tax cut plan also faces "obstacles" from the American public, with 35% of respondents backing spending increases for health care and education programs over tax reductions. Only 22% favored a tax cut as a "top priority" (Milbank, Washington Post , 2/27). In addition, a national survey conducted last week by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press found that support for a tax cut ranks "well behind" spending for Medicare and Social Security (Brownstein, Los Angeles Times , 2/27).
In addition to his tax cut proposal, Bush also plans to "reiterate his belief" in "fundamental reforms" for Medicare and Social Security during his speech tonight. However, White House sources said that Bush "has not yet decided on how to pursue" a Medicare overhaul "or even when to take up the issue." One senior health official said that Bush has not decided whether to craft a "detailed" Medicare reform package or back legislation in Congress. "That's part of the discussion now," the official said (Goldstein, Washington Post , 2/27). Bush's budget proposal will also include several health care initiatives, such as doubling spending for medical research and earmarking $124 million for new community health centers to provide care for more than four million uninsured Americans (Hall, USA Today , 2/27). The president's speech will begin tonight at 9 p.m. EST and last about 40 to 50 minutes. After the address, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt (D-Mo.) will offer the Democratic response (Milbank, Washington Post , 2/27).

A new California law establishes a Bill of Rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) residents of long-term care facilities, including California’s eight Veterans Homes, which provide residential and long-term care services to about 2,200 veterans and their spouses.
Senate Bill 219 makes it unlawful for any long-term care facility to deny admission, transfer or refuse to transfer a resident, or discharge or evict a resident from a facility, based on the basis of a person’s actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or HIV status.
“Treating everyone in our care with dignity and respect has always been a hallmark of operations at our Veterans Homes,” said CalVet Secretary Dr. Vito Imbasciani. “We take extra care to ensure that LGBT veterans are treated fairly, just as we work to ensure that all veterans have access to the benefits they have earned — regardless of their race, origin, religion, gender or sexual orientation.”
Imbasciani, a gay married father of two, was featured in a November 2017 article in the Bay Area Reporter.
SB 219 also makes it unlawful to willfully and repeatedly fail to use a resident’s preferred name or pronouns, after being clearly informed of the preferred name or pronouns.
It requires employees to receive online training on “building respect for LGBT older adults,” and requires that each facility post a specified notice regarding non-discrimination alongside its current policies.
California Veterans Homes are located in Yountville, Barstow, Chula Vista, Lancaster, Ventura, West Los Angeles, Fresno and Redding. Residents enjoy numerous activities, including social events and outings, dances, patriotic programs, volunteer activities, arts and crafts and computer access.

Many toddlers are always enjoying playing with toy cars and trucks. Basically, this game have been extending from toddlers top even the tween ages. It is evident that toy cars are for both boys and girls and as they engage in playing with them, they get to grow up together through being creative over the years. For example, it is during the playtimes that the child will even have the car crashed. It is mandated that your child will even start determining and defining destinations and the reason why they need to drive to that destination using their toy cars. Therefore, toy cars are overly beneficial and below you will learn more about the benefits of toy cars to the ultimate development of toddlers.
First and foremost, car toys help expose a child to STEM learning. Many people have been exposed to STEM learning or they at least have an idea of what it is. STEM is an education program that deals with science, technology, engineering and mathematics. With STEM, kids get to learn about new things through experimental or real life applications of the four faculties represented by STEM as a one unified education model. Therefore, ensure to get toy cars that are STEM related for your toddler. Toy cars that help sharpen STEM skills have STEM stickers. The toddler is entitled to learn more immediately they start launching the cars from the loop. Your child will be exposed to subjects like velocity and weight amongst others.
Through the use of toy cars, toddlers tend to enhance their fine motor skills. The child’s development is somehow subject to the development and enhancement of these fine motor skills. It is where these toddlers learn how to launch the cars, how to throw, carry, push and pull the toy cars that they sharpen and fine their motor skills. Basically, these skills will be reflected when the child starts holding pencils or even using scissors. A child tends to embrace and develop dexterity and high eye-coordination skill as they upgrade to using remote controlled cars.
Finally, toy cars help toddlers with cognitive development. A child will always learn new things when playing. There is a difference between learning and understanding what one learns. A child will always enhance their understanding levels as they progressively play with toy cars. They get to garner and experience and a sense of responsibility as a driver. This enables the child to start learning and understanding the different parts of a car.
Learning new things is inevitable for toddlers. It deems fit that they lead an early experimental and practical life. Therefore, the above info is timely as it portrays the benefits of having your toddler get experimental with toy cars.

The Assassination missions you do as Franklin for Lester is a great chance to earn a lot of money for all three of your characters, as they can greatly affect the stock market. In fact, Lester even tells you this whenever you do the first mission, Hotel Assassination. Note that the BAWSAQ is linked to Rockstar's Social Club and requires an internet connection, so if Social Club is down, the BAWSAQ will also be unavailable.
Each mission will greatly affect a single stock, either in the LCN or the BAWSAQ. Before beginning the mission, you want to go to each character and invest a large sum of money (or even all) in the stocks listed below. If you wait until the mission starts, you are only limited to Franklin and will need to fail the mission to allow switching. It's best to do a Quick Save via your phone before starting the missions.
Once you do the mission, go to one of your safehouses and sleep around 3 times, which will pass time 6 hours each. When you wake up, you should have a huge return on the stocks you bought, so sell them all and roll in the money you earned. The following is a list of stocks to invest in, along with their corresponding mission.

He should be made to quit from the exalted Office of the Bar Council of India. Just as a former Chief Justice of Supreme Court of India allowed his official residence to be used as the private Real Estate Business headquarters of his beloved sons, this shameless Solicitor General of India (SG) has used his residence to function as the legal headquarters for protecting the corrupt Union Minister A.Raja in the Case relating to the Himalayan Mega Fraud 2G Spectrum Case pending in the Supreme Court of India. Gopal Subramaniam was the ‘chamcha’ of the most corrupt Former Union Shipping and Transport Minister T.R.Balu. Now he is functioning as the ‘private chamcha’ of the Union Minister A.Raja. Thus Gopal Subramaniam has become the unsought Saboteur General of India (SG) on the one hand and the much sought after Solicitor general of India (SGI) for Union Minister A.Raja.
It has been widely reported in the Press that a meeting of CBI and Enforcement Directorate Officials took place at the Official residence of Gopal Subramaniam the Solicitor General of India on 28th October 2010 to discuss the 2G Spectrum Fraud Case. Anitha Shenoy, the Advocate for A.Raja, was also present, though she had no locus standi to participate at that meeting. This ‘meeting’ was ‘designed’ by the SGI to facilitate Anita Shenoy in the ongoing 2G Spectrum Corruption Case in the Supreme Court. This SGI had summoned CBI’s Investigative Officer Vivek Priyadarshi and DIG S.K.Palsania for that meeting with the hidden purpose of helping Anitha Shenoy and not assisting the Enforcement Agencies of the State like the CBI in effectively conducting the prosecution of the case.
Palsania told the SGI: “We have nothing to do with Raja’s advocate and we are not supposed to talk to her. WE WILL REPORT ONLY TO THE DIRECTOR OF THE CBI AND NOT EVEN TO YOU AND MUCH LESS TO THE PRIVATE ADVOCATE FOR UNION MINISTER RAJA. We cannot be dictated to. We are under no official obligation to report to anybody about the progress of the probe.” Ignoring SGI’s illegal and immoral instructions, these officials then walked out of the meeting.
Immediately thereafter they brought SG’s open interference on behalf of Union Minister A,Raja to the notice of the CBI Director Ashwani Kumar.It has been reported that CBI Director told Union Law (less!)Minister Veerappa Moily: “We demand a new Counsel in the place of this SG. We do not want to entertain Gopal Subramaniam anymore”.
After the controversial meeting on 28-10-2010, the SGI claimed “illness” in order to absent himself from the next hearing at the Supreme Court of India on October 29th 2010. Raja’s advocate Andhyarujina had informed the Supreme Court of the SGI’s “illness”. Mercifully and hopefully for the helpless and battered people of India, the CBI was represented by Additional Solicitor General Harin Raval on that day.
I would like to pay my tribute to D.I.G. PALSANIA for having done his official duty without getting pressurized by the immoral moves of Gopal Subramaniam at the meeting held on 28th October 2010. It was Vineet Agarwal, who was Deputy Inspector General of Police in the CBI, who exposed the corrupt and fraudulent connections of Union Minister A.Raja with Ms Nira Radia. For having done his official duty in a fearless manner, he was transferred from the CBI and posted back to his parent IPS cadre of Maharashtra! Only the firangi memsahib (of course not our ‘Boneless’ Prime Minister or ‘Shadow of Shadow’ Union Home Minister!!)knows what fate awaits D.I.G. Palsania for having done his official duty at the meeting at SG’s residence on 28-10-2010!
One Public Interest Litigation(PIL) case in the spectrum scam has been filed by senior advocate Prashant Bhushan, NGO Telecom Watchdog and veteran journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, who have demanded that the Supreme Court monitor the CBI probe. The Court has sent notices to the CBI, ED, Income Tax, Department of Telecom and A Raja in this case. The CBI has invited severe criticism from the apex court for its “slipshod” investigation.
Responding to the SGI's 'stellar' performance at his official residence on 28th October 2010, veteran journalist Paranjoy Guha Thakurta has commented thus: “It is a very serious issue. There are powerful people who, on behalf of Raja, are trying to influence the judicial system. If this is true, it is highly condemnable.”
Another case in the scam has been filed in the Supreme Court of India by JANATA PARTY PRESIDENT DR.SUBRAMANIAN SWAMY, demanding sanction from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to prosecute Raja.
Pointing to the “hidden deals” being undertaken, Dr.Swamy has stated: “The meeting of counsels representing the Union Government, the CBI (investigating the 2G Telecom scam) and Minister A Raja (the prime beneficiary of the scam) is a gross violation of ethics, and represents a tampering of evidence and to rig advocacy in the Supreme Court, which is hearing my petition on granting of sanction to prosecute Raja.” The only inference anyone can draw is that this is a clear case of national sabotage and cover-up.
Dr.Swamy has also added, “I demand the PM to order an inquiry and determine which political authority had directed such a meeting to take place. OBVIOUSLY, THE UNION LAW MINISTER VEERAPPA MOILY MUST HAVE ORDERED IT AT THE BEHEST OF SONIA GANDHI. SONIA GANDHI IS CONCERNED IN THE CASE TO SAVE A RAJA BECAUSE SHE HAS RECEIVED PART OF THE HUGE SCAM’S ILLEGAL PAYMENTS.”
Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Arun Jaitley has told a TV news channel: “It’s surprising how an advocate pleading for an accused is in connivance with the CBI. Both the investigating agency and the advocate are sitting together to try and bail out A Raja,”.
Solicitor General of India Gopal Subramaniam has of course denied that he had called for a meeting of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials and Anitha Shenoy, the private counsel for the Telecommunications Minister A Raja.
He has also said: “These allegations are absolutely wrong and a complete work of fiction. She (Raja’s counsel Anita Shenoy) had not been called to the meeting. Besides, she is a junior counsel. Raja’s main counsel is TR Andhyarujin. That poor girl (Shenoy) had just come to my office to hand over a bunch of photocopied documents. Not even Rawal (Additional Solicitor General) was there in the meeting. I had asked Rawal to look after the CBI case, while I was handling the DoT case. It was a meeting only with CBI officials and I had called them as a matter of routine, as a precautionary measure so that I was not factually incorrect while appearing before the Supreme Court. I didn’t ask them to show any papers.”
In the context of this controversy relating to the questionable conduct of the Solicitor General of India, I am reminded of what Hon.Justice Lucilius A.Emery had stated for all time in the famous case Hancom vs Marston, 82Me, 288,298 in 1890:” The fact that a lawyer advised such foolish conduct, does not relieve it of its foolishness.”
I remember reading a brilliant book by Wesley Wiksel titled ‘Do They Understand You’ when I was a student of St. Stephen’s College in Delhi in 1960. He had stated in this book: “All the skills of speech are of no use if our words are insincerely spoken.”
I am not a trained lawyer. Thank God for that! I would have been forced to waste my time arguing before some of the known and supremely corrupt Supreme Court Judges of India. As a citizen of India I am interested in the History of Law and Justice. Thomas Erskine was one of the greatest advocates ever to appear in an English court of law. As King’s Counsel he was involved in many celebrated trials, including the prosecution of John Horne Took for seditious libel and of Queen Caroline for adultery. His other notable achievements include the successful defence of Thomas Paine’s Rights of Man, which cost him the post of Attorney-General to the Prince of Wales. Erskine also served as Member of Parliament for Portsmouth and for just one year as Lord Chancellor.
Thomas Erskine was one of the bar's greatest names. Few however know this extraordinary story of the man who traced his way from poverty through the navy all the way to the bar and Parliament to the House of Lords and the Woolsack. Almost 200 years after Thomas Erskine's death most barristers and solicitor advocates still aspire to his legendary oratorical and forensic skills. IN THIS CONTEXT I AM NOT REFERRING TO THE S G!!
I recall reading an inspiring book titled Trial of Thomas Paine, written by Thomas Erskine (1750-1823) and published in England and USA in 1792. In this book Thomas Erskine wrote as follows: “ I WILL FOREVER, AT ALL HAZARDS, ASSERT THE DIGNITY, INDEPENDENCE, AND INTEGRITY OF THE ENGLISH BAR; WITHOUT WHICH, IMPARTIAL JUSTICE, THE MOST VALUABLE PART OF THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION, CAN HAVE NO EXISTENCE. From the moment that any advocate can be permitted to say that he will or will not stand between the Crown and the subject arraigned in the Court where he daily sits to practice, from that moment the liberties of England are at an end.” India’s Saboteur Generals have nothing but contempt for the liberties of India. They are only interested in protecting the public loot of our Union Cabinet Ministers and politicians, safely lodged in Swiss Bank Accounts!
Let me now become less grave and end this sordid story by lapsing into levity with a comic verse called Lawyer’s Law.
Telecom Minister A Raja has finally resigned. Two years after The Pioneer first exposed the 2G spectrum scam, pegged at Rs 1.70 crore by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), the DMK Minister became a casualty of sustained Opposition pressure, intense media scrutiny and public debate.
Upon returning to New Delhi from Chennai late on Sunday, Raja drove straight to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s residence from the airport and submitted his resignation. “In order to avoid embarrassment to the Government and maintain peace and harmony in Parliament, my leader (DMK chief M Karunanidhi) has advised me to resign. I will prove my innocence…I did everything in accordance with the law. I brought about a revolution in the telecom sector. My conscience is clear. I did much for the country, for my people,” Raja said.
Minutes later, the DMK headquarters in Chennai stated that Raja had been advised to submit his resignation to the Prime Minister for ensuring smooth functioning of Parliament and that there was nothing wrong on his part in following the procedures in the allocation of 2G spectrum. Raja had followed the 1999 National Telecom Policy, the statement added.
The one man who gets full credit for the fall of Raja is undoubtedly The Pioneer’s Special Correspondent J GOPIKRISHNAN, who first blew the whistle on the 2G spectrum scam in December 2008. Thereafter, he wrote as many as 70 incisive stories on the scam, exposing various facets of Raja’s murky designs in spectrum allotment. Gopi launched the crusade and kept it going when few others dared to take on the ‘mighty’ Raja.
With the Opposition determined to stall Parliament over the demand for Raja’s removal and the Supreme Court on Monday slated to hear two cases related to the 2G spectrum scam, the Congress leadership had little option but to nudge Raja out of the Union Cabinet.
When news tricked in late on Sunday that the Prime Minister would make a statement in Parliament on the 2G issue, it became clear that Raja was on his way out.
The process to get rid of Raja was set into motion earlier in the day when Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and Sonia’s political secretary Ahmed Patel met to discuss the party’s strategy, especially in view of the impasse in Parliament and the Supreme Court hearing on the 2G scam involving Rs 1.76 lakh crore.
However, in Chennai, a defiant Raja refused to resign, saying he had done “nothing wrong” and that everything had been done according to the procedure set by his predecessors. He met Karunanidhi twice during the day amid speculation over his removal even as senior DMK leader and Tamil Nadu Law Minister Durai Murugan arrived in New Delhi for discussions with Congress leaders.
The Opposition has also decided to corner the Prime Minister after Raja insisted that he had “kept the PMO in the loop at every stage” during the spectrum allocation process.
Mukherjee had told newspersons after the meeting that the Government would make “any announcement regarding Raja only in Parliament”. However, according to sources, Mukherjee telephoned Karunanidhi immediately after the meeting and requested him to replace Raja with another party leader. During the day, a number of efforts were made by various leaders — including Ghulam Nabi Azad and Home Minister P Chidambaram, who talked to DMK leaders — to persuade the DMK chief to remove Raja from the Union Cabinet.
“A lot of efforts have been made by the Congress to convince and persuade Karunanidhi to replace Raja. A number of leaders have spoken to the DMK chief and those close to him,” sources said.
Even though pressure mounted to recall Raja, the DMK was firm that he had done “nothing wrong” and Raja declined to resign even as he emplaned to New Delhi on Sunday evening. Two Congress Union Ministers from Tamil Nadu come out in his support, asking the Opposition to wait till evidence against Raja was established.
Since his arrival in Chennai on Saturday night and return on Sunday, Raja met the DMK chief and Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M Karunanidhi twice at the latter’s residence. Former Union Shipping Minister and the DMK parliamentary party leader TR Baalu also met the party persident. After his 30-minute meeting with Karunanidhi, Raja reiterated he had done nothing wrong and that he did not discuss resignation with Karunanidhi as “the question never arose”.
Congress spokesperson Jayanthi Natarajan said the Congress’ crucial alliance with the DMK remained unchanged, ending speculation over whether Karunanidhi would exit the UPA Government, which it currently supports with 18 MPs. Karunanidhi was worried about how the dismissal of Raja, a dalit leader, would be perceived by voters in the State. Tamil Nadu votes in a few months for its next Government. The DMK still maintains that Raja has done no wrong.
The Pioneer newspaper in Delhi and its unmatched correspondent J.Gopikrishnan must be given full credit for the exposure of the criminal fraud and corruption of former Telecom Minister A.Raja. He was officially sustained in this sphere of unprecedented mega corruption by the solid internal support of the equally corrupt Prime Minister and his Mother Superior firangi memsahib whose global corruption became known through out the world thanks to the Full Page Advertisement released by patriotic Indians in USA in the New York Times 2 years ago. The Sonia Congress Party and firangi memsahib tried to blackmail these Indians and failed miserably.
Dr.Subramaniam Swamy is also a Field Marshall in this war against the corruption of Union Telecom Minister A.Raja. He is a man of destiny. Mother India has great things in waiting for him in the immediate future. The majestic, heroic and resplendent role played by him by filing legal cases in interminable succession against corrupt Ministers in authority are an imperishable part and parcel of contemporary political history.
I would also like to pay my tribute to all the TV Channels who have played a magnificent role in exposing the Himalayan corruption of A.Raja, side tracking the continuous blackmail and blandishments of the Sonia Congress Party and its supremely corrupt Supremo.
In particular, I would be failing in my public duty, if I do not pay my unreserved tribute to J.Gopikrishnan, the correspondent of The Pioneer in Delhi. Ones fingers are too many to count the number of patriotic, courageous, responsible and socially accountable exemplary journalists with unimpeachable integrity in our corrupt and decadent country today. Too many members of the working Press are too willing to uncritically pass on—even if they do not personally swallow—too much high level Government and political cant, trype, and public relations. There are too many corrupt journalists like former Minister A.Raja who are very willing to sell their birth right of candour and truth in order to become Government Pets, Party Pets, Corporation Pets etc. and who wistfully yearn after public prominence or gray eminency or blatantly crave for publicity for themselves, on lecture platforms or political rostrums.
We don’t have many journalists of the caliber of J.Gopikrishnan who are vitally interested in national or public issues. I would like to express the hope that more journalists like J.Gopikrishnan would fearlessly come forward to encourage rather than avoid controversy and argument, remembering that controversy and argument are not the enemies of democracy but its friends. Most of the men in the media today—both print and electronic—seem to be resigned to a wretched state of apathy, cynicism, lukewarmness and passive acceptance of the status quo about everything from the corruption of A.Raja to the dictatorial and authoritarian ways of the firangi memsahib. It is a public tragedy that we don’t have many journalists, endowed with a high sense of idealism and lofty public vision like J.Gopikrishnan today. Finally many of our journalists seem to have forgotten that MEN AND NOT NAMES ALONE, MAKE NEWS.﻿
Thanks.I am greatly encouraged by your writings. To our younger generation, people like you, who never bent to anybody are always guiding lights. We consider people like you with great esteem. Praying to GOD for keeping courage like you for ever.
Thanks a lot for giving ball to ball detail of the what is happening behind the wall to cover up this huge corruption case. When most of the TV channels print media are trying to protect the govt, your article gives hope that there are people who care for justice.

Was fun to sit for a while with good company while listening to good music, but because I was sick then also and knowing myself, bought a return train ticket in advance. Otherwise after a couple of beers I get so excited and then I'm still hanging around at some morning after-party. x) It was very good to get to relax after a day like that. ^___^

Movie by me and fellow animators and computer artists - Credits; Sören, Mads, Awesta, Andreea, Michelle, Fredrikke.
Here is some Animation I did for the movie, ...And I also worked on some clean up and colour, storyboard and designs. Everybody was in the pre-production. We are both computer graphic and animator artists who worked on this. WE animars had to work ith limited animation, that means, really fréw frames and cheating on movement so it does not take that much time... but I could not manage. I like smooth, Disney-like animation.
Animating did go so slow. We where not so orginased as we could have been in my group .... but in the end it went fine, and I really enjoyed the project. The animators ahd a lot off shots each - We also cleaned, inbetweened and coloured; In like 2 weeks...
This was my shots I had to animate. My step 3 of rough animation off the very first character shot...
Our style guides was "Ren & stimpy" creator John kricfalusi and Chris Haugton. Our words we got to build the movie from scratch from was "Toe", "Melandrama" and a quote by David Mamet: "Every scene should be able to explain three things - Who wants what from whom? What happens if they don't get it? Why now?"
The ugly-ass character I designed. Th animated characters had to be ugly, EXAMPLES off John K style;example, example example, example .We where thinking off having closeups like John K uses; But we did not get to that point, we did not have enought time...
He also does really rendered paintings for closeups, and all the chicks are hot and nice looking... Our's is a strong female!!! :)
For all characters there is really interesting background storys and character descriptions, but I'm not gonna post it here for now...
My name is Sofia, I was born in 1993 in Stockholm, Sweden. I study to become an animation artist with a Bachelor's Degree at VIA University Collage in Denmark, Viborg. This is my animation blog where you can find assignemts done in school and personal work. I get my inspiration from anything! I especially like Art history, pop culture.

The Pupil Premium is an allocation of additional funding that is provided to schools to support specific groups of children who might be vulnerable to underachievement. Nationally these include pupils who are, or who have previously been, entitled to free
school meals (FSM), those who are looked after by the local authority, those who have been adopted from care and the children of armed service personnel.
Schools are free to decide how to use this allocation, considering how best to support individual pupils with additional provision. All schools are now required to report on the amount of Pupil Premium funding received and how this funding is being used, as well as the impact of this funding on pupil progress. How do we know this is making a difference?
We track the progress of every child at HTPD on a termly basis and we compare children according to several different characteristics, including FSM. We carefully monitor the progress of all children attracting the pupil premium and compare it against the progress of other children in the year group. The small number of children identified as receiving pupil premium in some year groups means that care is taken in determining the statistical significance of this comparison.It is more helpful to look at the individual children involved, to ensure that we identify any child who is not making expected progress and plan appropriate strategies to support them. We regularly assess the impact of any interventions funded by pupil premium in order to ensure that they are effective and targeted towards the children who need them. For more information on the Pupil Premium, please visit: www.education.gov.uk/schools/pupilsupport/premium
This is an important source of extra funding for the school and so, if you feel that your child may be entitled to free school meals, please contact the school office so that we can advise you in a confidential manner about how to apply.

MoCool 13 is a mere 16 days away! Some of you may not be aware that MoCool, which is billed as "the world's longest running off-line gathering of wine lovers", owes some of its successful longevity to our own Robin Garr. From 1995 through 2008, Robin chronicled and took pictures at MoCool and helped promote it to the online wine drinking community here. Over the years, it has given many WLDGers a chance to meet in person, and carry on the camaraderie we enjoy in the forum.
For those who would like to join us..go to http://www.mocool.org and plan to go to the greatest wine event of the year. G.I.R.L.S. gone WILD!!!
Many of us are unable to attend so good luck. It would be nice if there were some pics of the event and more TNs so that we can all indulge in the experience.
Wish you could make it, Bob. We actually have a nice Canadian faction that attends. I know last year there were abundant pictures and videos of the event on FaceBook. Someone said it was easier to post pictures there...I don't know about that. We'll do our best to keep the WLDG crowd informed....and enticed!

I have blown caution to the winds, and will be there arriving on Thursday mid afternoon hopefully. My featured on theme wines will be three of some pretty special Spanish red wines. Along with a story on how they were selected. Will likely bring a couple CndP probably Pegau. Will likely have something decent for opening on Thursday and Friday evenings too.
My sister-in-law Luci and I will be attending and arriving on Fri. afternoon. I got a note from Ol' Willie (William Holmes)that he will be celebrating his and Beth's 50th anniversary at that time and not able to attend, which is too bad as he said the theme wines were his favorites.
I am coming and bringing lots of rieslings for my hoizonatal/vertical tasting. It is going to be a great time! Looking forward to seeing all the MoCool regulars again this year.
Looking forward to seeing my brothers and all the cool MoCoolians! I noticed some of our WLDG members haven't signed in here yet...there are more!
I'm still mulling over bottles, although Pegau, Beaucastel and Prüm on the definite "Saturday" list. Probably find at least one Muscadet and a cab franc to cover the Loire (maybe desert as well?). Adding a special German for Trombley to go with the traveling Sundial bottles, and I'll dig up a few from Spain (maybe a Rioja, and some older Clos Erasmus.... and probably others). That leaves Italy, which I'm going to have to defer to Marwan as the only bottle I have worthy of bringing is too young (I'm very poor when it comes to Italian bottles in the cellar).
Speaking of Thursday I am thinking of Shrimp in a Provencal butter wine sauce over Polenta dish for an appetizer to start the evening. Something a little lighter which should go well with a Chardonnay before the beef and big reds come out!
For Thursday we are thinking about Salmon with Oregon Pinot (Argyle Nuthouse and/or Archery Summit) and a Zinfandel. For Friday we are leaning toward Bordeaux and we are still narrowing down the theme wines for Saturday. Riesling and CdP will definitely be in the mix.
I am still trying to make a deal for a 76er Auslese to bring, but no luck so far. The provenance is somewhat iffy with significant label decay and the owner wants too much in cash or trade. My "best and final" offer was met with complete silence.
Sam Platt wrote: For Thursday we are thinking about Salmon with Oregon Pinot (Argyle Nuthouse and/or Archery Summit) and a Zinfandel. For Friday we are leaning toward Bordeaux and we are still narrowing down the theme wines for Saturday. Riesling and CdP will definitely be in the mix.
This interests me. With all the different wines consumed over the 2/3 day period, how does one coordinate the food/s?
Alan takes care of coordinating the menu with the wine theme on Saturday. Friday is typically a mish-mash of good wines making menu coordination impossible. For Thursday we are bringing a wine to match the food that we plan to supply for impromptu carry-in dinner.
Cindy and I look forward to reuniting with the MoCooligan gang in less than two weeks! Haven't finalized the wines but a Donnhoff Spatlese is on the short list. Have a bunch of barolos (baroli??), brunello, and amarone from which to choose. A Pegau or Beau CdP. Probably a nice little Champalou Vouvray as my Loire inventory is pretty small....and Spain as well.
Bob Parsons Alberta wrote: This interests me. With all the different wines consumed over the 2/3 day period, how does one coordinate the food/s?
As Sam pointed out, Alan does the menu for Saturday and he selects dishes to go with each type of wine. Specific types may only have an appetizer to match, but there will be something. Typically we will have about a dozen different types of appetizers, plus cheeses. The main dishes are usually chosen to go with big reds, which most people bring for their dinner wines.
Thursday night is a party just for people staying in the cabins on site, and we usually chose a theme that is different than the MoCool theme. This year we have not done that, however everyone brings a dish and wine to match. Friday night is a out-of-town MoCooler party at one of the local organizers home. That is a catch all and everyone brings some mighty fine wines and there is no real coordination of wine and food. There will be good matches, but that just happens coincidentally.

Besides beef, I might consider duck if my one source has a good supply of breasts. The only small issue would be cooking it -- not really the best on the grill as the rendering fat usually causes flames. And, not looking to smoke up (or heat up) the cabin [I like to cook first on fat side, flip over and place in oven for a bit to bring up temp more evenly]..... I'll ponder it between now and decision time.
I'll definitely try to bring along some local tomatoes again as I did last year. Heard the crop in MI was a little late this year....
I am thinking of bringing pork tenderloin, marinating it and cooking medallions on the grill. My pairing would be an Oregon Pinot, Carleton Cellars. However, it looks like the menu is getting quite protein heavy so, I may change my mind. But as far as I am concerned the more pinots the better, especially from the Willamette valley.

At this point it appears we will have some marinated flank steak for the grill so the protein parade continues. And I may be able to dig up a WV pinot.
we are running zimbrar mail server with many mailboxes. One our employee has problem with writing a new email over web client. When he hits Enter to start a new line, Zimbra automatically insert an attachment (it is that email he is writing). Before hi finish his mail, it has many attached files.
When a user from webmail (Firefox 54.0.1 and Windows7 or 10) answer or forward a message with some attachment, automatically appear original attached files (and duplicated) if you attach a new one from your hd.
Some of our users copied their signatures via copy-paste from Outlook, ultimately causing this extremely annoying behavior.
In some cases, we actually had a different images pop up in their signature. Didn't dive into that any further, but that issue seems to be gone since signatures have been reset.
Also, not sure if it makes a difference, but we actually uploaded the signature image into the briefcase and referenced it from there.
Word of advice for testing; if any of you include previous messages when forwarding / replying and the "bad" signature is in any of those previous emails; naturally the issue will represent itself.
Also, a little unrelated; for most people it is rather obvious, but for those to whom it isn't: the use of the "/" in the naming convention of folders is a definite no!
You will notice, when importing via IMAP, most clients will drop the import procedure immediately, some half way through, which is even more annoying.
So remove all "/" characters before you start the import from each and every folder and sub-folder. Let's hope there are not hundreds of them.
I can confirm its the issue with signatures.Had trouble with this around New year 2018 when colleagues added decorations to their signatures ... Didnt have time to investigate what does what exactly.

Saved my week!
Safelite attempted to rip me off and charge me $650 to get a windshield substitution that P & G replaces for $229. Safelite experimented with to take care of me just like a fool Whilst P & G handled me with regard and gave me a good value.

I had cracked the glass and took it in at the outset to possess them just repair the crack; having said that, Joe (the operator) explained we should just go on and exchange it and it wouldn't be too high priced and would glance so significantly better using a brand new insert.

Glass ultimately came and Tony the technician arrived to set up it. Tony is incredibly Skilled and went higher than any further than to clean the vehicle just as much as he can from every one of the small bits and pieces of glass that were everywhere you go. He created guaranteed the glass lined up flawlessly and also the motor vehicle is back again like new as though nothing at any time occurred.

The Fair Trading Act (called Competition or Anti-Trust Law in some countries) is intended to eliminate or curtail business practices which hinder or prevent firms from competing freely with each other, thus providing consumers with greater choice of products at lower prices. The Act does not apply to:- collective bargaining; agreements regarding copyright and professional associations; companies that fall under the purview of the Telecommunications Authority Act 2001 and the Securities Industry Act 1995; any other business or activity declared by the Minister by Order subject to affirmative resolution of Parliament.
The Fair Trading Act provides for the establishment of a Fair Trading Commission, to promote and maintain fair competition in the economy and for related matters. An effective Fair Trading Act is essential to the realization of the benefits that can flow from the liberalization of international trade and foreign investment.
Mergers, acquisitions or take-over which substantially reduce competition or reduce access to a market.
Collusive arrangements, agreements or undertakings between a number of firms to limit competition between themselves or to deter other firms from entering the market.
The Fair Trading Act forms part of a programme of domestic legislation that follows from commitments by Trinidad and Tobago, encompassed in The Revised (CARICOM) Treaty of Chaguramas and the Agreement establishing the WTO. The Act interfaces with a wide range of policies (Trade, Industrial, Regional Development, Intellectual property, Privatization) and Regulations such as the issuing of licences for trades and professions.
The Act presents one more reason for firms to maintain accurate records of their operations. Accurate records are essential in support of complaints to the Fair Trading Commission or in mounting a defense against such a complaint. Charges of anti-competitive behaviour are not to be taken lightly. The Commission, for the purposes of discharging its functions, may make application to the High Court for the determination of a contravention of the Act. Obstructing or impeding the activities of the Fair Trading Commission may, on summary conviction, result in fines and custodial sentences.
The Fair Trading Commission may initiate its own investigation of suspected anti-competitive behaviour. It however remains the responsibility of business persons to bring such behaviour(s) to the attention of the Commission.
Information and Communication Technologies emerge, again, as an important part of the framework needed to establish Trinidad and Tobago as a network-based economy, able to operate in truly global markets. In this situation however, economic activity and potentially anti-competitive behaviour, becomes more difficult to regulate in the different geographical markets and jurisdictions.
The TTCSI notes that essential layers of the new ICT infrastructure are either still under bottle-neck control or threatening to fall under such control, e.g., access to ‘top level’ connectivity on the ‘inter-net’ has become divided into two groups of providers:- leading ‘backbone’ providers and ‘others’ who pay access charges to them. Parts of the ‘top-level’ connectivity could soon be dominated by enterprises who may then abuse their dominant position. The recent ruling by the European Court, against Microsoft, accusations against Apple (accused of variations in pricing between markets) and concerns about Google, suggest that ICT consumers in Trinidad and Tobago need to be alert to developments and to bring these concerns to the attention of the regulatory agencies.
Service providers must be vigilant and ensure that the adjudicating authority (Fair Trading Commission), when it is established, has the human, financial and technical resources to assess each case in a timely manner. Small, developing economies, with few industries and few firms in each industry, cannot afford to be too ‘broad brush’ and general in our approach.
The Act seems, Part 1 3(1)(i), to allow special treatment and possibly ‘Efficiency Defenses’ in specific cases e.g.,:-
Declining industries ( to allow competitors within a declining industry to co-operate in managing their withdrawal from the industry).
Agreement between competitors on product standards or to form a joint venture to develop a new product.
Two multi-product competitors agree to specialize production with each supplying the needs of the other.
After the establishment of the Fair Trading Commission, members are urged to ascertain, from the Commission, general information with respect to their rights and obligations under the Act and to bring to the attention of the Commissioners, any suspected anti-competitive activity.
The Ministry of Trade and Industry is in the process of establishing the Fair Trading Commission. Member Associations who wish to review the Fair Trading Act, No 13 of 2006, may visit the TTCSI web site www.ttcsi.org

With so much time having elapsed since we last made a log in our adventure, I feel it pertinent to give very rough account of the events that have occurred ever since. I do not attempt this lightly, as there will be things left out due to both memory and time’s effect on it, but I do not attempt it for myself, I attempt this for whoever, or whatever comes next. If we fail in our upcoming mission, then certainly our lives could be forfeit, as it is with adventuring, but this time we go against the law.
We last left off with the tower in the Shieldlands in search of the Anvil of Vecna. The many horrors that we saw and experienced could never be explained in enough detail as to fully describe them, but nonetheless we survived. The Drow occupying the tower were funneling the eternal suffering of dozens upon dozens of people to what I could only assume was a ritual regarding the Anvil itself. All the magicks were taken to a central location where we found a large group of Drow Clerics surrounding the Anvil itself, performing a ritual. We were found out, and greatly wounded by fire before we could act. We plunged into the thick of battle, where Sir Arkemis was permanently injured, and many of us were close to death upon its end. Unfortunately, the ritual was completed, a sort of Vile teleportation spell that could have sent the Anvil anywhere. After defeating the Drow, we were discovered by the Duke and taken back to the encampment, where we explained all that we had found and experienced. The Duke, beset by this seeming defeat, hinted very heavily that we were to leave his employ and take word of this confirmation of the Anvil of Vecna to the Pale. With heavy hearts, and pursued by the Duke’s men as deserters, we eventually made it to the Pale, though our names are forever on the books as traitors to the County of Urnst.
In our travels we come to find out that the High Sunkeeper has died, and a new Conclave is about to begin to elect a new one. It is because of this that we find our travels both more and less difficult. Stopping off in the city that Amelia spent much of her life, we find the dead have been rising in the country where that just doesn’t happen. Acutely aware of how not good this is, we investigate heavily, only to find out that the Priest that has gone missing was actually killed by a servant of the three evil gods and sacrificed in a vile ritual, no unlike the one we had seen in the tower. Defeating the evil, at the sacrifice of the Paladin’s life that helped us, we found that the catacombs underneath the church were ones that held Cardinals, but not any that I had ever heard of, let alone in an area that to my knowledge, held no Cardinal Seat, ever, and the man who had been sacrificed held the identifying markers of a Cardinal as well!
Taken aback by all the new information, we headed to Wintershaven once more only to find the city almost impossible to move around during normal hours. Using the prayer times to move about the city, we were eventually able to get inside to see the heads of the church of Heironeous and St. Cuthbert, the latter only on the word of the former as a favor. With the two Churchs backing us, they petitioned the State of the Pale to hear us and our plea, which was granted. After learning much about the politics of the Pale, we eventually were seen and we presented our case. Two stand out men in the Cardinals spoke, an older man and a younger, who’s names I would rather not spell incorrectly and will be referenced to thus. Eventually they dismissed us, talked amongst themselves, and came to the decision that they would not come to one. There was much infighting of the Cardinals, as it seemed to be between the two men on who would become the new High Sunkeeper. The time allotment came and went, and the Light of Palor went out, and the Church split into two different Churchs. The city went into utter and complete chaos as thousands died in the riots that attempted to destroy the Cardinals for their hubris. The older man took the reigns of the city and attempted to calm the people, while casting out the younger man who, him and his fellow Cardinals, left to make a hold elsewhere. The group followed the younger, if not only because they preferred him to the older. The ceremony was performed at both sites, and both claimed to have spoken to Palor himself. The group showed the High Sunkeeper the letter from the Duke, one that should only be able to be read by the High Sunkeeper, and he offered his help to us, however little he could.
With no absolute direction, we faced a problem: what do we do now? For some time we discussed it, and eventually we came to the consensus that we should find out what happened to our beloved Duke, and the best place to do that would be in the New Shieldlands, and the front of the Eternal Crusade. As we slowly made our way into Furyondy, Kit asked that we stop by her childhood home as it was barely off the path we were going to take anyhow. The group agreed that it was fine and off we went. Come to find out, the area has been ravaged again, but this time by deserters from the Furyondian military who have been destroying the land to the point of magically preventing things from ever growing there again, along with rape (assumed), pillaging, and burning of farmsteads. On behalf of the peasants, we took the issue to the area’s Count, who was not there. So we went up the chain to the Duke of the area. Come to find out, the Count was in court as we presented the case to the Duke, and was chastised for not doing his duty. We offered our services to help the Count clear his area of these bandits, and it was agreed.
Based on the information that we were provided, we came up with a plan to hopefully lure the people to one of their assumed escape routes which seemed to be mining cave networks. We set up a trap that we were to spring in the cave when they arrived, and in an effort to not be surprised by anything already within the caves, we began to explore them. After discovering and clearing out undead, and clearing the cave of a dragon welp, a Paladin of Heironeous stumbled across the group. Cedric the Shiny had been lead here by the call of his god, and with him we explored some deeper reaches of the dungeon.
The group decided that it would be a good idea to take a mine cart ride to the bottom of the shaft we picked, only to find out that was a stupid decision. With the Paladin almost dying, and being saved by Kit, we should have turned around, but didn’t. We continued down for three days. This was a bad sign and we knew it, but we wanted to make sure. Coming across fissures in the earth that the mine cart had originally gone across, but was broken through by something smashing it upwards as if flying up out of the depths, we were drawn down further. The group went down until finally, we came across a cave of glowing moss, a first indicator that the Underdark is near. After battling a giant worm, instead of going down and following cart tracks that we had discovered, we finally went back up to the original area where we had intended to lay our trap.
Finding that humanoids had come and gone already, we kicked ourselves for our stupidity and went after them. With Kit on their trail, we eventually made it to a walled in cave where I shattered a hole in the entrance, enough to get through. There in the cave system, we found a used, inactive Teleportation Circle. Angry and disappointed with losing our quarry, but unwilling to venture in further until we’d had sleep, the group sleeps nearby. Awoken to the sounds of battle, we had been attacked by rogues! After finishing them off, we look to see if there are others, and we find more. Attacking first, asking questions later, we kill the group only to find empty wands and tokens, one for each of them. Confident that we were in the right, we find a stash of 10 cloaks, one for each rogue we fought, plus 4. We lost their trail, as the cave was massive and there could have been any number of ways they could have come from, or gone.
We take our defeat in stride and head back to the city of the Count, and come to find out much has occurred in our absence. The King of Furyandy has been kidnapped, the Duke assumed mortally wounded or dead, the Count is dead, and the Countess is in his place. Determined to report all that we have found, Sir Arkemis gets us an audience with the Countess and we recount the events of the last week or so. She seems….off to several members of the party, as the last time we met her she was a meek, unassuming woman, and now the person that stood before us was powerful, determined, confident yet stressed, fully in control of the affairs of state, and above all else, she had little sadness for her dearly departed husband. A very different picture than was painted initially, especially considering how much she seemed to love the Count the first time we met. It was this that made the group wonder if she had anything to do with the events that had recently transpired, whether she was mind controlled or had simply been playing the Count for some time, though the possibility that she simply took up the mantle incredibly well exists.
With that in mind, we decided to seek the Black Market, without the knowledge of our Paladin of course. With the help of Amelia we found a man to buy and sell things from, most especially information. The man didn’t recognize the token, but he did have a lead for us. The lead we got was that there was a prisoner in the jail sent there directly by the Countess herself. Heading to the jail, and using the Paladin and our resident minor noble as a beating stick, we bug the Countess enough to have her let us question the prisoner, coming to find out that it is the previous Captain of the Guard!
Sir Arkemis questions him, secretly letting him know that we think he is innocent. He also says he in innocent and that he is confident he knows who is behind all of this, but he cannot say who in present company, *cough*the Countess*cough*. The Captain also lets us in on the fact that when morning comes, he is to be executed, and with that the party decides to go on a mission to rescue the man from the very place he was sworn to protect and serve.
Tonight we have seen much that can never be unseen. Evils and magical constructs that, while not hard to physically overcome, are left in our minds as scars, the Vileness of sentient creatures has no bounds. We left the Duke’s camp under the cloak of darkness and Silent spells, searching the outer wall of the city with scouts and Elves. At first we were skeptical that we would find anything at all, perhaps a futile attempt at what we could only hope would exist, but when we found the opening…we were simply amazed. The detail and depth of the tunnels we found honeycombed beneath the city was simply astonishing. The amount of time that this took could mean many different things, including, but not limited to, these being here before the war even began. As we are realizing this, the Duke splits us all up into groups of five to investigate the tunnels to look for anything that could be how the drow got here or, for us specifically, looking for the Anvil of Vecna itself.
As we go off, we find another lower level that we immediately begin to search through. A Lolth-touched Spider attacks us through a hidden door, which after all makes perfect sense considering everything that’s happening here. After burning down many webs that block our path, we eventually come across the most Vile thing any of us has ever had the displeasure of laying our eyes upon. A Living Flesh Golem made from one of Sir Archemis’ cousins. The flesh was ripped from the rest of the body and seemed to have life of it’s own, as the muscles were a separate entity that had moving, working organs and blood vessels that we could see with our own eyes.
Unfortunately, Ruhan knew not how the creature could, if possible at all, be returned to herself, as she was being transformed into the Golem in front of our eyes but was not fully there yet…so we ended its miserable existence instead. The muscles were incredibly resilient, so we attacked the skin which was far weaker. As we re-flayed the skin, as horrifying an act as it was, the girl was crying out in agony, and as it died, she cried out the name of her mother. It was a soul shattering experience for all of us.
The party has added another member to our party, a ranger with powerful combat skills using a double-ended mace, named Kit. She has agreed to come along as our guide, as we are now in the Bone Marches searching for clues on the line of Tellit. The party is here because of Ruhan’s research and following clues from an ancient poem, telling them of the line and hinting at their summer home. That may seem odd to say to anyone knowing the Bone Marches, but it used to be a very fertile and beautiful land before it rapidly decayed.
Entering through the escape route, they find it has a mausoleum, of all things, inside with a painting that takes up the whole ceiling. This is no ordinary painting, for it you look close, it’s actually a large portal to another plane! What the plane is will require much more investigation, especially if it’s a pocket dimension, another plane altogether, perhaps even another material plane! Sir Arkemis had the idea to use a grappling hook to teather a rope to the other side, as it is the opposite of us, like a mirror. Ruhan only gets a slight peek, ends up hanging from the rope and quickly found it’s a one way portal, luckily the magic was still affecting the rope, and his compatriots were holding onto the rope from the other side so they could force him back through. They decided to look up the other path first, only to find the starts turn into a slide, and into a pit trap. After braving the dangers a second time, they find on the other side the summer home itself.
The palace is an open air villa, beautifully laid out and stylized, though now nature has had it’s way with it for hundreds of years and it is in bad disarray. The party comes across several different hostile denziens who had made this place home (including one nasty rust monster), and once it was clear, they set forth looking for secret doors using Ruhan and Moonbeam to flush them out. They ended up finding a total of 7 secret doors, not surprising since servants aren’t meant to be seen, and most of them were just that…until they checked the one in what might have been the Vizier’s bedchamber.
A most vile and yet wholly interesting place, they found a vast shrine to Hextor. Murals created down the path, inside were some interesting notations, including what Ruhan thinks to be Vecna’s Anvil. When they reach the first floor they find a 50 foot radius summoning circle! Complete with everything you could want in it…including a voice activated Summon Planar Ally spell that Sir Archemis accidentally activiated, summoning a demon into their midst! On a guess, Ruhan used the correct command and was able to banish it with the help of the same voice command system.
As they take down any information they find, they find there are two other exits from this room, one goes up and one is another room on this level. Deciding to go check out the room on this level, they find another library. As they look through the library/torture chamber combo (like ya do), they find several tomes that emit evil auras (no surprise there), and one that is not only evil, but it has the symbol of Hextor, Lolth, and Vecna inscribed on the spine! Since they don’t want to even touch the vile thing, they caress it out of its spot onto a bag on the floor, and it springs open to a page! It doesn’t lazily turn a few pages then settle, no, it slams open! They both have the smarts to completely avert their gaze and gather the bag up, closing the book and hopefully not trigger anything magical.
The stairs up are apparently just to a hidden cell block which is also hidden behind the throne room. Convenient for sacrifices, no? Sir Arkemis decided to remove the child’s skull so that we could talk to it later. While that has it’s uses, it still unnerves Ruhan, and he’s not sure what to make of Sir Arkemis’ decision to do so.
They go to check the last secret door, the one in the shrine room. The room is a place of worship to the gods that the old kingdom worshipped, that includes good and evil alike. Upon opening the secret door, the find a small room with a mural of none other than the Sun himself, Pelor, on the floor. The group is shocked to see such a development, especially after where they had just been. The session ends with the group considering what this room could possibly have been used for.
We begin again with our heroes deciding to risk entering the watchtower in order to light the beacon and summon the Duke’s troops to the area. It is agreed that Gabriel, Yeoman Jimmy, and Peter will stand as a diversion in order to leave the rest of the party unmolested as they try to find the secret entrance in the river. The plan appears to work…For a few seconds. Soon, the archers on the tower refocus their energies on those trying to sneak in. Arrows begin to rain down, one finding a small chink in the armor of the Knight, piercing the flesh of his shoulder. Shrugging off the damage he continues to hold his shield high in an attempt to distract them long enough for the gnome to secure the entrance. He catches a glimpse of his attackers and identifies them as the scourge of the Underdark. Drow have ventured forth into the light for some nefarious purpose, and our heroes discover what it is to be on the receiving end of their bows. Eventually the gnome is successful. He finds a way to open the portal, and they dive in before the arrows prove to be fatal. After a brief swim through some murky waters, they appear in a long narrow hallway. Carefully they approach the other side and find a small hatch in the ceiling. The corridor has shrunk to the point of causing the taller of our heroes to crouch before attempting to open it. They listen and hear muffled voices coming from the other side. Deciding that the voices pose no immediate threat they lift the hatch to find themselves in a small wardrobe. After making the requisite jokes about witches and lions, they start to formulate a plan. It is about this time that the enemy issues its ultimatum. “Come out and surrender yourselves!” The heroes had been found out, and worse, the enemy had time to prepare for their arrival. So they were left with the option of abandoning their quest and retreating, or swinging the doors open wide and bringing on their doom. Of course, not being the brightest of adventurers, they went with the latter of the two options. Six drow were waiting for them on the other side. A volley of arrows nearly dropped our wizard friend riding atop the Druids war dog. But he made it through. In a vicious combat that ensued, the knight decapitated the cleric before being struck down by the blade of one of her minions. Thanks to the courage of his allies he managed to survive as they immediately took up arms to help their fallen comrade. They fought valiantly and struck down the remaining foes, then took up duties healing those who had been injured during the melee. Too injured to continue though, they sought refuge back at the scrying pool. After a quick discussion about where to go, the wizard was sent to go fetch Peter and Gabriel. While he was gone, Gabriel showed back up and informed the party that Peter had fallen in combat. But he brought news in the form of an evil, ancient skull of immense power. Called the Skull of Kas’ Might, this skull has the power to raise an army of the undead and leave them in the control of the wielder. It was then it was determined that the party needed to venture forth back into the watchtower to ensure the beacons lighting. In a turn of luck it seemed that the undead, without the control of the skull, reverted to mindless abominations. This left the tower open to the party with minimal resistance from one of Lolth’s spider minions for them to get through to make it to the top of the tower. After climbing to the top, the beacon was lit. However, much to the party’s chagrin, the Duke had already arrived! Their efforts, though amazing, were unnecessary. Their salvation had already come.
The undead were once again in formation. Had something happened to Gabriel and the sleeping Druid? Upon returning to the scrying pool the found the druid still asleep, but Gabriel had fled with the Skull. It was his power that now controlled the horde. After discovering this, the heroes ventured forth to meet with the Duke. After debriefing him, the party found that several more skulls were stored within the Theocracy of the Pale. Considering this was the same place that Peter’s Holy Symbol needed to be laid to rest, it seemed a good direction for the group to travel. And with a letter of welcome from the Duke, and four new horses, they set off into the night to find Gabriel, wherever he may be hiding.
Our adventure starts with our heroes in the County of Urnst, at a small hamlet in an Inn called the Adventuring Martyr, where an ad requesting help at a nearby vineyard is posted. Each has come here for their own reason, but they all notice this ad, including a half-orc that only seems to be able to communicate in single word sentances. Sir Arkemus calls to the whole Inn that he is deciding to go after this job, and that if any wish to join him, then they should come see him in his room. Both Galen Woodsoul and Galdor Vardamir take him up on the offer, along with the half-orc tagging along, while Ruhan Lamont is content to head towards the vineyard himself, in his newly found pants, albeit only 50 feet behind the rest.
When they arrive, our heroes are greeted by an old guard in rusted armor, who tells them that the Lady will inform them of what the job entails at dinner tonight, and they are welcome to wait in the barn. The half-orc leaves, and the rest get to talking and getting to know each other, and eventually settle to just waiting for dinner. When dinner comes, the Lady greets them all, and begins to lay out the situation. The Lady’s vineyard has come under a sort of attack of late, with larger and larger patches getting damaged and becoming unusable every night. The wall is missing large chunks out of it where it’s being knocked down, and the workers refuse to go out and patrol because they hear the screaming of children and the laughing of women, along with many bright colored lights. One of the guards pipes up and says that it’s just the Goblins that live up in the hills, that there is no other explaination. Thanking her for the information, our heroes start off by questioning the servants. After giving them just about the same information, the servants let slip that they were questioned by the half-orc earlier. Fearing that they’d been tricked, the heroes rush to find the half-orc, only to find already gone.
Our heroes decide that the best plan of action from here would be to take a look at the scene of the incident first. As they look about, they realize that the vines were most likely manipulated with a simple magic spell, and as for the rest, they decide to create a blind behind a section of the wall and lie in wait for the rest to occur. Not having to wait long, a deep cold settles in, and a large rock with lights surrounding it comes barreling down the hillside. The sounds as described earlier could be heard, but the sounds of children screaming were identified as the spell Ghost Sound, and the lights as the spell Dancing Lights, but the laughter seemed to be genuine laughter coming from somewhere. Just then, many Goblins came running down the hill after the rock, and it slammed into a new section of the wall. In an effort to detour the Goblins, Ruhan created an image of an Ogre. That only stopped a few Goblins, who soon realized it was a trick, and went to join the others. All of a sudden, from above them, the spell Color Spray appears, stunning a good number of the Goblins. Sir Arkemus, believing another foe in his midst, issues a challenge to the being in the area, only to have his sword turned into a rubber chicken. Ruhan, thinking the opposite, went forward and used a Color Spray of his own, while Galen and Galdor fired arrows. Soon, the laughter stopped, and the cold retreated, as the half-orc came running full speed down the hill, yelling for the fighting to stop. Reluctantly, it did, and to the surprise of our heroes the Goblins did not continue fighting. Our heroes come to find out that it was the Good Folk, playing a trick on the Goblins, who did all of this, and the Goblins want to simply worship their sacred stone in peace in the hills.
Healing all but one of the Goblins, who had already passed, the heroes swear to help the Goblins fight the Good Folk who are doing this. Galen and Galdor go to inform the old guard of what has transpired, while Ruhan, Sir Arkemus, and the half-orc go to prepare with the Goblins for the coming night. They remove all the Goblins, minus the chief, and prepare a trap. They lie in wait, and soon the Good Folk, saddened by the lack of Goblins to play a trick on, appears. A Fairy Dragon it is, and our adventurers attack it! The quickly gain the upper hand as Moonbeam, Galen’s Animal Companion, seems to be able to hit it at every weak point. Wind and cold rage as the Fairy is torn asunder, and when it falls, so does the weather. Our heroes have won the day.
Delleb is the Oeridian god of Reason, Intellect, and Study. His symbol is a phoenix-feather quill, or an open book.
Delleb is depicted as a tall, thin Oeridian man with olive skin. His features are elderly, and the top of his head is balding but for some short white tufts of hair, primarily on the back and sides. He is usually shown with spectacles in modern portrayals, and dressed as a noble scribe or finely attired scholar.
More rarely, Delleb is portrayed as a fully armored warrior riding a warhorse and carrying a sabre (Delente-Vinnos, “That which strikes down ignorance”) and a strange projectile weapon of metal and wood. Delleb believes that the pen is mightier than the sword, however, and he once drove away a young, murderous Hextor using nothing but his quill.
According to rumors whispered by those knowledgeable in such arcane matters, Delleb was the deity who sponsored Daern, hero-goddess of defenses and fortifications, to her present exalted state.
Delleb hates lies and dislikes fiction; as a result, he and Syrul have battled one other intermittently since long before the Invoked Devastation. He has been at odds with Hextor since the quill incident. He is allied with Boccob, St. Cuthbert, Lirr, Heironeous, and Zuoken, and friendly to all but those who are evil or who oppose knowledge.
Delleb’s realm, the Great Library, is in Solania, the fourth of the Seven Heavens. Solania is a place with many scholarly hermitages and monasteries hidden atop high, steep peaks.
Delleb’s order teaches that the purpose of existence is the accumulation of knowledge, although they are careful to remind others that this does not supersede the sanctity of life. Ideally, this is knowledge that must be passed from teacher to student. What cannot be learned from teachers may be learned in personal research through books. What cannot be learned from books may be learned through experimentation.
Delleb warns of the dangers in letting emotion cloud one’s reason. He teaches the importance of educating others. Secrets that contain true knowledge are seen as blasphemous, for knowledge belongs to everyone. Even evil knowledge is sacred to the church, though they try to keep it out of the hands of those who would use it for evil ends. This may seem to be a double standard, but goes hand in hand with Delleb’s desire to preserve life first. Debates about the nature of good and evil, and what constitutes “evil knowledge,” are frequent among all of Delleb’s sects.
The church teaches its clergy and followers to hone their intellects. Riddle and pun contests are common and important. The winners are often rewarded with higher status within the church or access to some of the more “sensitive” books.
An honorary order within the church for those who sages and philosophers who are not clergy is the Silver Savants. Membership in the order is awarded to those who have made great discoveries or unearthed long-lost knowledge, and they are held in high esteem by members of the church.
Delleb’s clerics (sometimes known as Tomesages) are devoted to learning and to using their knowledge to help and teach others. They ask questions of bards and sages, pore over old books, help engineers plan and invent, and travel in search of forgotten lore.
Clergy of Delleb’s church generally wear the black robes of a scholar. On ceremonial occasions they wear black mortarboards with tassels of gold, silver, or white. The tassels denote scholars, librarians, or members of the Silver Savants respectively.
The scholars of Delleb are the largest group and contain among them the best thinkiers, philosophers, mathematicians, scholars, historians, and sages in the church. They are divided into learners and teachers. The learners revere learning for its own sake; some are inventors. A scholar of Delleb is credited with the invention of the crossbow.
Teachers are a smaller sect, running the various church schools and spreading knowledge as widely as possible. Teachers are divided into assistance, acolytes, mentors, and savants. The librarians of Delleb are dedicated to repairing, copying, illuminating, and indexing the books in the libraries of the temples. The lower-ranking librarians are called scripters, while the higher ranking ones are called bookkeepers. The bookkeepers answer to the Chief Librarian. The knights of Delleb are an order of warriors dedicated to defending the church and spreading knowledge as far as possible. The group has grown considerably since the Greyhawk Wars.
The church is also known for its doctors and healers. A few temples of Delleb are dedicated solely to knowledge of the healing arts.
The Knights of the Book are paladins dedicated to Delleb. They protect temples, serve as military advisors and leaders of troops levied to protect the church and the lands around it. They also act as teachers of military strategy and history.
Temple-schools of Delleb can be found throughout the Flanaess in regions settled by Oeridians. They are most prevalent in Furyondy, Nyrond, Veluna, the Urnst States, and Keoland.
The largest of Delleb’s temples is the Savant Hospital in Chendl. Before the siege of the city it was called simply the Library Temple, but the library has since been moved south to Littleberg. The Savant Hospital has been rededicated to the healing order of the clerics of Delleb, and they concentrate on medical texts and teaching others about the healer’s arts. They defer to the priests of Rao.
The University Temple in Rel Mord is closely connected to the Royal University there, and its priets often teach at the school. The priests at the University Temple are widely held to be among the most knowledgeable and intelligent men in the land.
The Mass of Knowledge. The Mass of Knowledge is performed each Godsday. The ceremonies last the better part of a day, which is spent speaking of new learnings in an elaborately ceremonial fashion. The rest of the day is spent in free-form discussion among the clergy.
On the eve of Freeday, scholars of the Church of Delleb visit inns and taverns, listening and committing to memory local gossip and news. Freeday morning is spent writing notes on what is heard. The following week, the scholars try to determine what is true and what is false.

As highlighted by the Banff case study, there is growing recognition within environmental policy that stakeholder collaboration is a valuable tool for decisionmaking processes (Selin, Schuett, et al. 2000; Kloprogge and van der Sluijs 2006; Mangun, Throgmorton, et al. 2007; Bryner 2008; Jarman 2011; Davies and White 2012; Graci 2013).

Stakeholders: Theoretical Foundations ◾ 21 Within the policy process, subsystem activities may include bringing issues to the agenda, developing and helping to pass legislation, formulating rules and regulations, preparing and passing budgets, administering and implementing programs, and evaluating/revising programs (Thurber 1991). Policy subsystems may be particularly important in providing expertise that is beyond that of government representatives: The number of policy issues that can actively be considered and acted upon constitute a small portion of the range of possible issues demanding attention.

Have been in the south again, hanging out in Helsinki for a couple of weekends and was so much stuff and meetups, so many lovely things can fit in two weekends. :)
Lets start from the first thingie.. I left Tampere on saturday morning on a train towards my destination, Lolitat Suomessa-facebook group's first meetup, and was really quick with dressing up, because in less than two hours while on the train, did my makeup, made my hair(wig) and put on my lolita clothing, still had time to eat my bento too! :D
I missed Rosa Nitida's guiding to the meetup place at Manga Cafe because my train was a little late, but luckily found my way there fine by myself and on the bus met a couple of other lolitas on their way to the meetup aswell.
Ground source energy is a cost effective and low carbon solution for managing the energy requirement of any building, delivering both heating and cooling needs. Ground Source Consult Limited provide the experience and knowledge required to design and manage the installation of commercial and large scale domestic ground source energy systems.
From concept stage through feasibility at the start of a build project to completion and assessment of the installation, we work closely with all members of the construction team. The target is to deliver the most effective and efficient ground source energy systems possible. Our services include:
Ground Source Consult understands that project managers and property developers require accurate information in order to assess the feasibility and economic benefit of development of a ground source energy system.
We carry out thorough investigations into the geology, hydrogeology and water quality of a site. GSC determine the strata and aquifer parameters and propose the most appropriate solutions for design and installation of a the ground source energy system.
The results will also provide an informed assessment of the scope of the project and thus the possible costs involved in delivering the requirements of the building.
In addition to project feasibility studies, GSC also provide detailed investigations and analysis that includes understanding of the rock and soil constituents and physical conditions into which the boreholes will be drilled.
It is also imperative in certain circumstances to assess the water resources and potential impacts on the environment to make absolutely sure the proposed project complies with all Environment Agency (EA) and Coal Authority (CA) requirements.
Thermal Response Testing (otherwise known as Thermal Conductivity Testing) is one of the critical services provided by Ground Source Consult.
Through this process we can gather information regarding the thermogeology of a site and thus assess how best to deliver the required energy and carbon saving targets of the building.
The key to optimising the size of the Ground Source Energy System (GSES) is the energy flow and balance, i.e. how much heat is extracted or rejected but just as crucially, when it is rejected or extracted. In order to manage the energy flow it is vital that the facility energy demands are fully understood in detail. Carrying out detailed energy load analysis can lead to a smaller ground source energy system and therefore better energy tariffs.
GSC provide energy load calculations from domestic to large commercial and district energy systems. We work with the building team to optimise the energy loads for GSES including alterations to the buildings to balance building energy requirements.
Closed Loop uses a system of high quality polyethylene pipes which circulate thermal transfer fluid through the ground or through a body of surface water, absorbing heat (heating) or rejecting heat (cooling).
The closed loop design is determined by the geology of the ground and the energy demands of the building.
Ground Source Consult develop thermal models of the geological conditions and assess maximum and minimum loop requirements.
An Open Loop System involves pumping water from a ground or surface water source, perhaps a water well, river or lake. This water is circulated through the plant room heat exchange system and spent water is usually returned to the original source.
The benefits of a ground source energy system will only be realised if the installation is compliant with the design. Ground Source Consult offers a supervisory service to ensure that the installation of the system is compliant in every way with their design.
In order to optimise performance and to ensure all warranties are protected, GSC offer full healthcheck services alongside ongoing maintenance support. In addition, building requirements may change and systems may need to be modified or adjusted.
The Ground Source Consult team have many years’ experience reviewing and assessing existing systems and where possible rectifying errors and improving efficiencies.
The growth in the application of nuclear science and technology in the fields of power generation, medicine, industry, agriculture, research and defence has led to an increase in the risk of occurrence of Nuclear and Radiological emergencies in the State. Gujarat has Kakrapar Atomic Power Station (KAPS) in Surat District and is vulnerable to nuclear disaster.
Hence, the State has prepared an Action Plan for Nuclear & Radiological Disaster with an aim to work towards minimum risk to human health, life and environment, in case of an occurrence of a nuclear or radiological disaster. The plan defines the roles and responsibility of different stakeholders to be prepared and respond to such emergencies.
Title: Save our spaces - the great British sell off; how we're losing our vital publicly owned buildings and spaces. Forever.
In January this year Locality submitted a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to all councils in England to try and get a better sense of the problem. They were shocked to learn that on average more than 4,000 publicly owned buildings and spaces in England are being sold off every year. That’s more than four times the number of Starbucks in the UK. This is a sell off on a massive scale. These buildings and spaces have potential to provide vital services and support to local people, but they are being lost to the community forever, through private sale to the highest bidder. Community ownership is a solution that puts these buildings and spaces back at the heart of the community and protects them for local people for generations to come. Community owned spaces are where people can come together, meet their neighbours and access vital support and services. Spaces like Bramley Baths, a Grade II listed Edwardian bath-house in Leeds, which was saved by a community group in 2013 when cuts to the Council’s leisure budget meant they had to consider closure. It is now a shining example of community ownership. Opening hours have doubled, the number of children taught to swim every week has jumped from 950 to 1700, and young people can access a lifeguard training programme to develop job opportunities. Yet, our FOI request found that less than half of all councils have a policy, known as a Community Asset Transfer policy, in place to support community ownership.
According to a report by Russian satellite network on May 5, a new report released by Arctic Council Arctic Monitoring and Evaluation Plan (AMAP) Working Group said that the Arctic is rapidly melting and may be completely ice-free by 2040. In the meantime, a study by the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom found that in Antarctica, ice melts at a rate of about one-third of its expected value.
Why Arctic ice and snow melted so fast, and Antarctic ice and snow melting speed so slow? Reported that the reason for this problem is more complicated. On the surface, there are many similarities between the North Pole and the Antarctic: both are cold, sparsely populated, snow-covered wastelands at two levels of the Earth. But they are also fundamentally different: the Arctic is a sea surrounded by land (such as Alaska, Canada and the northern part of Russia), while the Antarctic is a land surrounded by the sea. The Arctic is thought to be essentially a giant ice mass in the Arctic Ocean, while Antarctica is land covered by snow and ice.
The report said that "essentially, the two effects of global warming can be offset by each other in the context of Antarctica. Both polar sea ice are melting at a faster rate (the number of sea ice both hit a record low in February ), The snow cover in Antarctica has resulted in the formation of ice sheets in some areas. "
Climatologists point out that increasing snowfall is another side effect of climate warming. One of the consequences of global warming is the increase in ocean evaporation, as the heat of the ocean sends water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor in the atmosphere increases, rainfall and snowfall will also increase accordingly.
In the past, snowfall in Antarctica was rare, but the warming of the mainland led to a wider range of frequent snowfalls in Antarctica. In contrast, however, the amount of ice in the Arctic has been steadily declining since the early 2000s.
Simply put, since the Arctic is cold, only less water vapor can enter the atmosphere. This means that there is very little snowfall in the Arctic and snowfall is scarce.
Antarctica has its own wind and ocean current, and thus isolated from the trend of global warming, while the Atlantic Ocean winds and the Arctic Ocean has brought a greater impact.

An excellent example of the complementary nature of Hubble's instruments may be found by comparing the infrared NICMOS image of DG Tau B to the visible-light Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) image of the same object. WFPC2 highlights the jet emerging from the system, while NICMOS penetrates some of the dust near the star to more clearly outline the 50 billion-mile-long dust lane (the horizontal dark band, which indicates the presence of a large disk forming around the infant star). The young star itself appears as the bright red spot at the corner of the V-shaped nebula.
The seventh edition of the international forum “Mediterranean Women” will be organized by Isis Center for Women and Development and Konrad Adenauer – Rabat on May 29, 30 and 31, 2015 at the Palais des Congrès, Fez, Morocco. The theme of this edition is “The Escalation of Gender-Based Violence Against Women and Girls in the Middle East and North Africa – MENA Region.”
While the post-Arab Spring turmoil is affecting men, women, and children, specific types of violence systematically target women and girls. The post-Arab Spring initial backlash on women’s rights is not only gathering momentum everyday, but is developing into unprecedented new types of violence against women with the dangerously mounting tide of extremist Jihadism.
The new forms of violence range from the imposition of the niqab (total veiling), the ban of women from public unless they are accompanied by a male member of the family, a return of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) for women between the ages of 11 and 46, stoning to death of (supposedly) adulterous women, assassination of female activists, Jihad al-Nikah (brainwashed women offering sex in support of the Jihadists), honor crimes, and enslavement (buying/selling of women and girls).
These new forms of violence are indirectly “sanctioning” the already familiar types such as moralization incriminating women for any social crisis, domestic battering, increased sexual harassment, forced marriage, and (gang) rape that accompanied the post-uprising phases in the MENA region. The ambiguous barriers between moderate and extremist Islamists is intensifying the daily misery of women in most parts of the region and threatening the hard-won women’s rights, and systematic brainwashing is involving more and more women in the recruitment of female Jihadists. In parallel, extreme violence against women is heavily used in the Jihadists’ propaganda narratives and glorified by mainstream media.
The dire absence of statistics, let alone serious academic research, on this issue is adding fuel to an already hot problem whose short- and long- term social, economic, and political repercussions are far-reaching and call for a combination of reliable research and urgent policies.
The Forum aims at documenting the new forms of violence against women and suggesting preventive solutions.
Eminent researchers, experts and activists from over 20 countries will participate in the Forum which will address 7 main axes:

i saw star wars tonight. it was amazing. my childhood remains intact. and i have a super awesome pint glass to prove it.
i had my dinner with an old friend tonight. that old friend i wrote about before. he was just as wonderfully attractive as always. and he really likes me too. he doesn’t believe in primary and secondary’s. he believes in “relationship anarchy”, getting what you need where you need it. which makes TOTAL sense. and is true about poly. but i also think you can’t ignore the hierarchy. he has a wife of MANY, MANY years. and he lives with her. and she gets deference. which makes sense. it is not a complete relationship though. and he has a lot to offer, a lot that isn’t what goes into the relationship with his wife. and i find him SO wildly attractive. (except the part where he stopped taking his blood pressure medication because it gave him a dry cough. one does NOT simply stop taking their BP meds. *sigh* mortals) anyhow, i am tempted. SO tempted. but is it the sexual needing in me or do i truly believe this could truly work? i don’t know. part of me thinks, well, sleep with him (or someone, really) to work out my unsatisfied desire, and then i would be able to think straight. and part of me thinks “you are insane”. as cliche as it sounds, i need to talk to my therapist. my first instinct is i would really really like to try.

India, Jan. 27 -- Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza achieved a milestone of amassing two lakh booking in less than a year of being launched. Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza achieves a milestone of 2 lakh bookings The Vitara Brezza is Maruti Suzuki's fighter in the compact SUV segment and it proved to be runaway success for the manufacturer. Launched in March last year, the Vitara Brezza helped Maruti Suzuki foray into the UV segment in India. It has been selling an average of 8000 vehicles every month between the period of March and December. It sold more than 85,000 units in that period and still has a waiting of around four to five months which even extends to seven months depending on the variants. The Indo-Japanese carmaker also has increased the production to 10,000 units from previous 8,000 units in August, owing to the increasing waiting period for the Vitara Brezza. Available only with a diesel option as of now, it is powered by a 1.3-litre DDis four-cylinder diesel engine with a power output of 88bhp and 200Nm of torque. A five-speed manual transmission is available so far, the automatic is on the cards. The compact SUV also has a fuel economy of 24.3kmpl. It is priced quite competitively as well, ranging between Rs 7.19 lakh and Rs 9.66 lakh (ex-Showroom Delhi)

Open new cannabis markets and all sorts of characters come out of the woodwork for a piece of what is sure to be a very profitable pie. This phenomenon can be observed in real time in Maryland now, as former politicians, law enforcement officials and even ex-DEA personnel have applied for licenses to grow medical marijuana. A state regulatory board is set to award up to 15 cultivation licenses this summer, and nearly 10 times as many companies have applied. Many, it’s believed, are seeking to get into the medical market with an eye toward recreational legalization at an unnamed future date.
While most cultivation license applicants are not especially public about their ventures, the Washington Post obtained the name of every company that has filed an application. Their reporting shows that the cannabis industry provides a potential second career for out-of-office politicians, lobbyists and one ex-NFL offensive tackle. There are also a handful of companies from other states that are looking to get in on the action.
Some prospective marijuana suppliers in Maryland even have ties to current Governor Larry Hogan. Forward Gro, for instance, includes Gary Mangum, a prominent Hogan donor, who served on the governor’s transition team and was appointed by Hogan to the Maryland Stadium Authority Executive Board. He is joined at Forward Gro by a former law enforcement superintendent who once led raids on state forest marijuana grows as well as a former sheriff.
In fact, a background in law enforcement is something of a theme among applicants. Alternative Medicine Maryland LLC is being advised by ex-DEA agent Charles Tomaszewski. Tomaszewski is up against numerous former judges, officers, agency officials and a special agent for the criminal division of the IRS. One of them, Ismael “Vince” Canales, used to be a strong proponent of criminalization as a member of Maryland’s Fraternal Order of Police. Now he and the former head of the Washington D.C. police union work with applicant Holistic Industries LLC. According to the Washington Post, at least 29 of the 144 applicants — that’s 20 percent — include people with ties to law enforcement. From a job experience perspective, this makes sense — people that have fought the marijuana trade ought to know it well. If cannabis were made fully legal, one wonders how many people currently enforcing criminalization would be just as happy on the supplier side.
Political experience is almost as common as law enforcement among Maryland cultivation license applicants — 24 companies include at least one former bureaucrat, elected official or lobbyist.

It’s easy to mock these agents of criminalization for jumping to the profitable side of the issue, and it would be nice if more people damaged by prohibition were given a chance to profit under legalization. That said, people softening or switching their stance on cannabis is what’s gotten us this far in the legalization movement, and we’ll need more of that for medical and eventually recreational cannabis to be legal nationwide. For now, legalization is coming state by state, law by law, and many of the people nudging their way into this new lawful economy have seen first-hand how profitable it can be.

Amazing how quickly the good guys are coming around to the money laced smell of marijuana. All these officials coming over to the green side. See I guess the grass and the cash ARE greener on the other side of the fenced in grow-op. All of these proper folks jumping ship for the fast cash, it’s hilarious. Oh and I’m sure all of these licenses will be given with no favoritism at all. After all it’s the government, they’re always totally fair RIGHT! OKAY bye.
Of course law encore movement from Attorney General to judges to cops and jails are in a conspiracy to make lots of illegal act laws. Then they want to be duplicitous and make money- greed and ignorance. Well Maryland should legalize and tax it for roads and schools.

Rinspeed is no stranger to building some pretty wild concepts that never make it to make production. So it’s no surprise that its latest creation, the Snap, is simply another design study, but an intriguing one. Set to make its debut this January at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, the previously previewed Snap is, essentially, a box and a chassis. Let’s start with the latter. The chassis boasts a number of technologies, such as electric powertrain components.
But here’s the thing: technology these days is progressing faster than ever and that chassis will soon be obsolete. No matter, because the body, or the box, can “Snap” on top of a next-generation chassis. Get it? This setup, according to Rinspeed, allows for the vehicle, as a whole, to remain state-of-the-art. Money and resources can be saved. The body can also be removed to allow the chassis to be utilized for additional purposes, such as a food truck or even shopping space. Maybe even a camper? The possibilities are endless. The body can easily be removed thanks to, in part, those little rollers on the edges of the wheels. Step inside and the Snap features plenty of configurable touchscreens.
Passengers are identified via sensors, such as an iris scanner. This makes it easier for passenger’s music, web, and other destination selections to be rapidly displayed. And, of course, because this is Rinspeed, there are some quirky features, including an AI-driven robot that can run errands and even small boxes where mint and berries can be grown.
A decent range-extender hybrid, but the price of the Chevrolet Volt does hold it back from greatness.

LA QUINTA — The Imperial Irrigation District is alleging Riverside County was in violation of California’s open meetings law, the Brown Act, when Riverside officials “lined up votes” outside of the public’s purview on an ordinance the district is now suing over.
What’s more, due to the alleged Brown Act violations, the district sent a letter from one of its attorneys demanding that the ordinance in question be rescinded or that Riverside County face additional legal challenges from the district.
The allegations were made public Tuesday at the district’s monthly meeting in La Quinta during a presentation by attorneys for Aguirre and Severson LLP, an outside law firm hired by the district to make a California public records request on its behalf.
The district is currently embroiled in a lawsuit with Riverside County over the approval of Ordinance 943, a law passed by the Riverside County Board of Supervisors in June compelling the IID to provide additional incentives to electrical customers who have installed solar panels on their properties.
IID officials are opposed to the ordinance, saying that at stake is the district’s authority to set its own rates and that the district is already in compliance with California state law.
“IID’s business model allows the district to offer its customers some of the lowest residential electric rates in California — rates that are as much as 50 percent lower than that of neighboring investor-owned utilities. The ordinance, should it be implemented, jeopardizes these rates and sets a bad public policy that has the potential to impact other public power providers across the state,” IID communications specialist Robert Schettler said in a statement.
The ordinance passed by Riverside County — which is not in effect, but in a court-ordered stay while the suit makes its way through legal proceedings — establishes new regulations and procedures for irrigation districts like IID that are operating net-energy metering programs. Net-energy metering is a program designed to benefit customers who generate their own electricity, usually via rooftop solar panels.
The Brown Act violation allegations are believed to be contained in a series of correspondence Aguirre and Severson requested between Riverside County officials and staff and principals in Renova Energy, a private solar installation company based in Palm Desert that appears to have pushed for the ordinance according to a series of emails.
“Because of the rather troubling aspects of the way this thing was passed, we asked outside counsel to make a public records request,” IID General Counsel Frank Oswalt said.
Oswalt said Riverside County responded to the records request Oct. 2 and within a series of email correspondence attorneys believed they found two emails, or examples, in which the Brown Act was violated.
The Brown Act states, Oswalt said, that a legislative body such as the Riverside County Board of Supervisors “shall not outside a meeting, use a series of communications to discuss, deliberate or take action” on a subject within its jurisdiction.
“Email correspondence produced by [Riverside] County reveal extensive, non-public solicitation and collection of votes by Supervisor V. Manuel Perez at the insistence of [Renova Energy owner Vincent] Battaglia. For example, by email dated May 5, 2018, Supervisor Perez urged Thomas S. Freeman, a senior Perez staff member:
‘Tom, let’s count the votes. Use this information and the fact that Renova will indemnify. If votes still not there, we will need Vince (Battagalia) to knock on those doors to get us there.’”
Smith Hoff’s letter goes on to cite a second email where Perez lobbies Riverside County Deputy Chief Executive Officer Brian Nestande on May 1:
“Hey Brian, what are we waiting on now? Let’s move this forward. Let’s count the votes. V. Manuel Perez”
Smith Hoff writes: “It is clear from the above emails that Supervisor Perez worked through intermediaries to develop concurrence on Ordinance 943 out of public view and prior to any public consideration of the matter by the board.”
Further, IID alleges in Smith Hoff’s letter that the email correspondence also shows “a secretly negotiated indemnity agreement between Mr. Battaglia and his companies (Renova and ERA) on the one hand, and the county of Riverside on the other, that preceded any public board consideration or action in connection with the adoption of Ordinance 943.”
“We see this letter,” Smith Hoff writes, “as providing you [Riverside] an opportunity to rectify an illegal action avoiding the need for further litigation.” From the date of the letter, Oct. 12, the IID has given Riverside County 30 days to respond or be subject to legal action.
“The Riverside County Board of Supervisors has and will continue to adhere to the requirements of the Ralph M. Brown Act. The allegations by the Imperial Irrigation District have no merit. Board members did not engage in any serial meetings in advance of the ordinance’s introduction and adoption. The recent disclosure of emails in response to IID’s public records request does not change the fact that there were no serial meetings,” Riverside County spokesman Ray Smith wrote in an email Wednesday afternoon.
Aguirre and Severson partner Maria Severson took the IID Board of Directors and those assembled at Tuesday’s meeting through a history of the “behind-the-scenes” development of the ordinance by way of a chain of emails outlining negotiations between Battaglia, Perez and others. There was a specific call to arms against the IID from Battaglia, according to the emails. Battaglia makes references to going to “war” with IID and in another instance calling the IID Board of Directors “rogue, corrupt and environmentally tone-deaf” through the development of the ordinance and the alleged negotiation of the indemnity agreement.
IID is “wasting rate payer money challenging a law they know they have no right to challenge,” Battaglia said Wednesday. “We addressed this Brown Act business. They are throwing anything at the wall to try to make it stick.”
Battaglia said the IID is trying to “paint it as if this greedy solar guy is trying to bring net-metering back. … It’s a just a game they are playing now trying to smear me. … It’s a cartel down there. I understand that mentality; I’m just not going to put up with that.”
No action was taken on the Brown Act issue by the IID board, as the issue was placed on the meeting agenda as an information-only item. None of the board members nor IID General Manager Kevin Kelley commented on the issue; Oswalt advised, “In fact, it would probably be inappropriate for the board to comment on it.”
Meanwhile, IID filed suit against Riverside over the ordinance back on July 13 in Riverside County Superior Court. The ordinance in question has not gone into effect, as the IID won a stay pending further consideration of the merits of the case. The parties are next due in court Nov. 6 in Los Angeles, seen as a neutral site by the court.
Below is a snippet from an article published on the California Farm Bureau’s AgAlert by Justin Fredrickson, environmental policy analyst for the California Farm Bureau Federation.
“Indeed, it’s no accident that numerous, solution-oriented conservation groups strongly endorse this bond, along with representatives of agriculture and business, flood-control districts and water districts throughout the state. Conservation groups supporting Proposition 3 include the Nature Conservancy, National Audubon Society, National Wildlife Federation, Planning and Conservation League, Sustainable Conservation, California Trout, Natural Heritage Institute, Ducks Unlimited, California Waterfowl Association and Save the Bay.
“That’s because Proposition 3 includes funding for conservancies, recycling, water conservation, stormwater capture, fish, waterfowl, Salton Sea restoration and forest management.”
LA Times: As states near deal on Colorado River shortage, California looks at water cuts of as much as 8%
After years of stop-and-go talks, California and two other states that take water from the lower Colorado River are nearing an agreement on how to share delivery cuts if a formal shortage is declared on the drought-plagued waterway.
Under the proposed pact, California — the river’s largest user — would reduce diversions earlier in a shortage than it would if the lower-basin states strictly adhered to a water-rights pecking order. California’s huge river take would drop 4.5% to 8% as the shortage progressed.
With occasional years of relief, the river that greens farm fields and fills faucets from Colorado to California has been stuck in drought since 2000. A shortage declaration has been looming over the seven-state basin for more than a decade, only to be narrowly averted time and again when rain and snow in the upper basin pushed reservoir levels above the trigger point.
Nearly two decades of drought in the Colorado River Basin have taken their toll on Lake Mead, a major source of water for Southern California. (John Locher / Associated Press)
But flows into Lake Powell — one of the Colorado’s two massive reservoirs — fell to a little more than a third of the average for the April-through-July period this year. And September’s inflow was negligible, less than 1% of the average. Looking at those numbers, federal officials say the U.S. Interior Department could declare a shortage in 2020.
“It’s pretty clear we’re in a deepening long-term drought cycle,” said Jeffrey Kightlinger, general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which has been importing Colorado River water to the region since the early 1940s. “It’s in everybody’s interest to prevent the system from cratering.”
The basin’s entire storage system is 47% full. Lake Powell, which stores runoff from the upper basin and releases it to Lake Mead, is 45% full. Mead, the source of Southern California’s river water, is 38% full.
The Interior secretary has never declared a shortage on the Colorado. But it has been known for years that the river is over-allocated. The basin states divvied up the flows in the early 20th century — a period that in hindsight was unusually wet and presented an unrealistic picture of what the Colorado could produce year in and year out.
Diversions are regulated by a complicated system of river compacts and water rights that call for Arizona and Nevada to take the first cuts in times of a lower-basin shortage. California, with some of the oldest river rights, is further down the line.
The sprawling Imperial Irrigation District and other farm districts in southeastern California control roughly 75% of California’s 4.4 million-acre-foot share. Imperial is the single largest user on the entire length of the river, which starts at the Continental Divide in the Colorado Rockies and has an average annual flow of roughly 15 million acre-feet.
Metropolitan has nearly doubled its base allocation of 550,000 acre-feet through agreements with Imperial and other irrigation districts that fallow crop land and sell their unused river supplies. Those deals would help cushion Metropolitan, which serves Southern California, if a shortage is declared. (An acre-foot is enough to supply more than two households for a year.)
Metropolitan would also benefit from water it has been able to bank in Lake Mead under 2007 drought guidelines that have allowed states to leave unused portions of their river allocations in the reservoir. Under the previous use-it-or-lose-it rules, states had to take their full allocation every year.
The 2007 framework specified that the Department of the Interior would declare a shortage when Lake Mead’s elevation hit 1,075 feet. Nevada and Arizona, which have rights junior to California, would then start delivery reductions.
Under the proposed drought contingency plan, Arizona and Nevada would continue to take the first cuts, which would be deeper than outlined in 2007. At the same time, California would reduce its river diversions when Mead levels hit 1,045 feet — earlier in the shortage than previously envisioned.
California’s cuts, shared by Imperial and Metropolitan, would increase as the lake level dropped but be no greater than 350,000 acre-feet a year.
Arizona is still working out the details of how to apportion its cuts among in-state users. And the lower-basin water districts have yet to approve the drought plan, which parties are hoping to finalize by December.
“I’ve got my own people asking tough questions. But I believe we can do it,” Metropolitan’s Kightlinger said.
A drought plan will not end debate among lower-basin users, who are confronting the fact that their use is outstripping the long-term supply.
“It’s not sustainable,” Kightlinger said. “We have to push it down or grow supply” with other sources.
With one month left before the Nov. 6 general election, water agencies should seriously consider making a concerted effort now to educate their communities about Proposition 3, if they have not already done so. Numerous reasons can be listed as examples of how passage of this water bond will not only benefit Californians, but their children and grandchildren. In the bigger picture, Proposition 3 builds on momentum from the passage of Proposition 68 passed in June, and it will require a tremendous amount of momentum to overcome the many challenges culminating within California water before our eyes.
Climate change, the increasingly catastrophic natural disasters that result from it and aging water infrastructure have compounded in the already uniquely challenging era in California water affecting us on a daily basis. Meanwhile, we remain well aware of the unacceptable fact that some disadvantaged communities lack access to safe drinking water – a problem that we strongly agree must be solved, but not through bad policy that leads to unanticipated consequences that benefit no one.
The Imperial Irrigation District is working with the Bureau of Reclamation and the other Colorado River Basin States to create a Drought Contingency Plan (DCP). Below is a clip from the Imperial Valley Press regarding IID and the DCP:
IID representatives, along with members of the various Colorado River water contractors, on Sept. 17 and 18 participated in a basin states meeting in Las Vegas hosted by the bureau to explore the creation of a basin-wide DCP.
“I attended the Colorado River meeting in Las Vegas to discuss the drought contingency plan process with the two basins and seven states that are in this process and identify critical next steps,” IID Board President James C. Hanks, Division 3, said during the regular board meeting Tuesday afternoon. “These meetings were led by Reclamation Commissioner Brenda W. Burman, and I can report that while there is still no DCP, there is considerable interest on the part of the Bureau of Reclamation … in completing one before the year’s end.”
IID is exploring the creation of a DCP in concert with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California that would expand how much water it can store behind Hoover Dam in Lake Mead. The DCP would only be approved by IID if it were to ensure that such water can be withdrawn on demand, that the authority to unilaterally preside over local agricultural water conservation methods are solely the purview of IID and that such an agreement would not put the Salton Sea at further risk of drying up due to lower water inflow.
Holtville resident and former county supervisor Wally Leimgruber is encouraging Imperial County residents to back the Imperial Irrigation
District’s appeal to litigation he argues may jeopardize the district’s authority over precious Colorado River water.
“As a property owner with over 28 years in the farming industry and now involved in land-use consulting, I am respectfully requesting you join with me and other business and civic leaders in filing an amicus brief in support of IID’s position in the appeal,” Leimgruber wrote in a letter he is sharing with county residents.
… Meanwhile, members of the El Centro City Council at its Sept. 4 meeting voiced support for Leimgruber when he presented his group’s position.
“Without access to water there is no reason for Imperial Valley to exist,” Mayor Cheryl Viegas-Walker said, commenting from a remote location by
speakerphone. “Water must be held in trust for future generations. I personally endorse this amicus brief.”
Also offering encouragement, Council Member Efrain Silva said, “Without water Imperial Valley becomes the next Death Valley. Wally, you have my full support and we should go as far as we can go.”
The following excerpt is from the Arizona Department of Water Resources. You can read the complete article here.
As news reports have indicated, the “August 2018 24-Month Study” of the Colorado River system, released Wednesday by the Bureau of Reclamation, tells at least two big water stories for the Southwest.
For one, it illustrates that the Lower Basin will not be in a shortage for 2019. According to the Bureau’s “most likely” scenario, Lake Mead will finish 2018 about four and a half feet above the “shortage declaration” cutoff, which is 1,075 feet in elevation.
A shortage declaration would trigger a set of criteria in the 2007 interim guidelines calling for Arizona’s deliveries of Colorado River water to be reduced by 320,000 acre-feet.
In addition to those anticipated conditions – inspired, largely, by decades of drought and a chronic structural deficit in annual Lower Basin deliveries – the 2018 August study tells us much about the complex relationship between the system’s two great reservoirs, Lake Powell and Lake Mead.
Water You Talking About? Climate change is worsening water woes across the world, and these complex problems require solutions that cross borders and go beyond politics. Quartz and the Texas Observer are partnering on a nine-part series, Shallow Waters, that examines how the US and Mexico are working together to confront controversial water issues along the border, sometimes overcoming and sometimes succumbing to political tensions. The first story introduces two key American and Mexican negotiators, and their counterparts in the Middle East who face a similar struggle to cooperate over shared resources.

I've tried writing this piece about the Sound Swarm in Hamburg a half dozen times. It won't come out. It was too tremendous a labor, should have written in installments. Summary: the Sound Swarm is a rolling loudspeaker orkestra, a loose choreography of bicycles whose together form a distributed mobile sound system to be used for direct action interventions or just ripping a whole in the fabric of everyday life. Aggregated into sub-swarms according to our tools: ants with megaphones hats, birds with home-made resonant 5-gallon bucket speaker systems, fish with a collection of 80's boomboxes, and bees with megaphones mounted on tall crutches. Each of these groups was fed a distinct audio channel via four fm transmitters mounted on the queen bee, a type of chariot built from two tall bikes with a cockpit in the center for the sound controller. The queen is armed with so many batteries, cables, gadgets, and antennas that it looked more lunar landing craft than anything for use on this planet. One of the festival curators called it "something from the next century". We can only hope she is right, that the art of the future will be made from junk, powered by human sweat, and defy the law. Being in the cockpit had to qualify as one of my personal favorite "performance" experiences, as we rolled off curbs, over cobblestones, through grass, dodging police, sometimes cowering under a plastic sheet during brief rain showers, while controlling five-channels of sound spread across thirty moving speakers in a chaotic mass of hundreds of bicycles pouring through the dark streets of an unfamiliar city. Like any worthwhile performance, the police department provides the last act with a siren-lights-as-disco-party crescendo. Have a look at this newspaper piece. Later there will be some video of the performance/action. Until then these stills of the preparation. I give up on trying to describe this more, just want to say thanks to Kampnagel for being a festival willing to take risks, and to this iteration of the Laboratory of Insurrectionary Imagination for being a team solid enough to realize such an idea.

Pacquiao to speak at Oxford and Cambridge » Sen. Manny Pacquiao addresses the Senate floor in a file photo.
After 14 years of relentless battle to seek justice after claiming to have been raped by her superior, Filipina Davaoeña Karen Tayag Vertido, whose alleged assailant was cleared by a local court, received a belated vindication from the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Cedaw).
After it considered the “communication” submitted by Vertido to improve international laws on rape, Cedaw said the Philippines violated the rights of a rape victim when a Davao court junked her complaint based on a gender-based myths and stereotypes.
Under the Cedaw “Optional Protocol,” a woman may bring before the U.N. committee a complaint of gender-based discrimination, provided she can prove she has exhausted all legal means possible to obtain justice in her home country.
In a landmark decision dated July but released only in September, the U.N. committee recommended that the Philippines review its rape law, including both the definition under its Criminal Code and its trial procedures, as well as to conduct gender-sensitive trainings for the legal profession.
It also recommended monetary compensation because of the undue delays in the proceedings and the reasoning used by the court in its decision which could potentially victimize the complainant.
In the case of Vertido, however, the state party cannot be held accountable because its judiciary acquitted the accused, the committee said.
It could not be ascertained if Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo had received a copy of the landmark decision of what steps he took, if any, regarding the case.
A call to Libran Cabactulan, the Philippine representative to the UN, seeking comment had not been returned.
It was on the night of March 29, 1996 when Vertido, who was then executive director of the Davao City Chamber of Commerce and Industry, was allegedly raped by a prominent Davao businessman, Jose Custodio, who was president of the chamber.
Vertido, then 42, told Cedaw that the 60-year-old businessman offered to take her home after a meeting.
And since he was a respected figure in the chamber and that another businessman was with them, she felt no reason to distrust the alleged suspect.
The decision is referred to as CEDAW/C/46/D/18/2008 and may be accessed at the website of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights at http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/jurisprudence.htm

Noticed on Monday that NT1010 has changed its longtime station voice, although whoever it is doesn't have quite the same panache as the former WLS brander that was there before. A few of their stingers are new as well.
I suppose it could be part of a refresh, and I haven't monitored other local Bell stations (like CKTB) to see if it's chainwide. But it will take some getting used to. I'm sure someone here knows who the new guy is.
It's Richie Favalaro, who is in house, heard on CHUM. Sound like a cost cutting move. They have also remixed the sounders...
Having a powerful 'voice' as the official Newstalk 1010 station voice may seem old school, and maybe a change was needed, but there is nothing notable about the new voice. The vocal tone is pleasant, but the read is matter of fact, there's no attention getting delivery to interest the listener.
But if they didn't for financial reasons... to riff on the old saying: penny wise, sound foolish, or at best, absolutely average.
CFRB could have used a distinctive voice, a voice that personified the station . . . to riff on the old saying: penny wise, sound foolish, or at best, absolutely average
Jody Thornton has a distinctive & authoritative voice that personifies the station; nothing average about it.
Actually, they're still doing both at the top of the hour news ID, but I think you're right that there's less emphasis on that ridiculous "iHeart" branding that I believe is fairly meaningless to the public at large.
Here's the thing geo. Both Jody and Ritchie Favalaro, (who radiokid has said in this thread is 1010's new station voice), have a great delivery when they do their regular gigs. Ritchie is sunny and charming as a DJ, and Jody has a rich tone to his voice with a specific, professional diction when he does traffic. It's the read that's offhand, and sounds very unlike either of them.

When do you tag and tattoo your calves? We have tattooed ours in the past but usually waited until weaning. Never tagged but considering it. Any problems with tags pulling out (ripping tender ears)? Sure would help to identify calves though.
If I find em newborn where I can catch em they get tagged right then. If I dont find them till their a couple of days old and hard to catch. I tag the first opportunity i get. Sometimes a few months. I keep a ammo can in every truck with tags markers and pliers.
I tattoo at weaning. Tag heifers at breeding. Do not tag bulls per my arrangement with how my bulls are sold.

Tag them, navel spray, inforce 3, multimin and band in first 24 hours. Just watch those protective mothers.
Tag, naval spray, First Defense at birth. Vet tattoos replacement heifers when he BANGS/pelvic measures @ appx 11 months. Tags rarely get ripped out but it does happen.
I prefer to tag them at birth, but if I can't get them within that first day, then I wait until the first working. It makes for much easier management and record keeping to tag them soon after birth, later on it is nearly impossible to get them in numbered in the right order. When I dealt with registered cattle, we usually tattooed them at the first working or weaning.
When tagging the newborn calves, ripped ears can happen, I try to be careful each time, and have used several different taggers, but still happens on occasion.
Everything is tagged at birth or as soon afterwards as possible. I tattoo when I work them all, which normally seems to be before weaning.
Tag, naval dip/spray, weigh, Multimin, Vit A&D, castrate if needed, and will be starting to use Inforce III at birth. Tattoo at about 3 months of age at first work up. Never had an ear torn. I use the full size ExtraLarge tags.
We weigh and tag every calf at birth. My number one quality when picking replacements is I that I must be happy with her mother. If I don’t like the cow, I will not keep a daughter. If you don’t tag them until weaning or after selecting them as replacements, you are giving up an immense amount of information about them. There are things like udder quality that you won’t see until they calve, but knowing their dam will give you a big hint. I suppose in a small herd you may know them all without the tag, but there is always some possibility for a mix-up. My herd is all black and without tags I would not know who went with who. I mark the bull number on the tag above the calves number and I put the cow's number down below. That makes it easier when sorting pairs into different pastures. Cows all calve in the same pasture, but when I put bulls out I separate them. I use the tags to make sure the calf and cow end up together and also to avoid putting a cow with her father. (Unless I intended to) This also makes it easier to see if one bull had superior calves.
We calve out on about a 40 acre pasture in February and March. We are feeding hay at that time of year. We check cows twice a day while calving. I throw out hay for the main herd and see who does not come up. The ones with the newborn calves will almost always be missing. We take a flake of alfalfa with us and go on the hunt. When we find the new Mother, we give her a flake of hay and then weigh and tag her calf. We use to have cows that were aggressive or would run off with their calves. Those were a challenge, but I have eliminated the more aggressive cows. If you can get to the calves before they are more than a few hours old they are easy to catch. We occasionally have a runner in the morning, but nothing we can’t catch.
I tatoo the replacements at weaning. The rest are sold to my regular buyer and are branded with his brand at delivery.
I tag the calves with a full size Z-tag. They remain in the ear of my replacements their whole life. Although now and then one will catch on something and pull free, it is extremely rare to lose one. I just replace them the next time I catch them. If I don't recognize the cow and I don't find the tag I can check the tatoo in her ear or do an inventory to figure out who in that group does not have a tag. I have 17 year old cows with their original Z-tag.

If you start ear tagging calves at birth you are creating a lot more work for yourself. It may be okay if you only have a few cattle.
Here is an article that explains that few cattle producers need to tag ears at birth. He also explains that it reduces profits by focusing on the wrong things.
A registered seed-stock breeder may need birth weight information at calving time. Commercial cattle producers do not need that information.

A friendly and informal group of walking enthusiasts now in our 31st year. Walks of all levels so please come and join us.
You may wish to join our closed FB group. We aim to publish all the latest information about forthcoming walks and other news as they happen. If you wish to join the group then email us using the contact form below but please ensure that you include details of the walks you have attended so that we can ensure that the members of the group are only regular walkers who support the CBMW.
We aim to send out information about any changes or updates to walks and news of social events via the website and emails as well as Facebook. If you would like to be included in our mailing list or receive these automatic updates, please fill in the form below and we will add you to the list.
We’ll be delighted to see you on one of our walks – it’s always a good idea to start with walks at the easier end of the grades so that you get an idea of what level you will enjoy. If you find the walks too easy you can always try one from the next grade the next time.
As far as protocol goes, we are a very informal group, all we ask of people is that they read and agree to abide by our conventions (found on the website and summarised in the first section of our programme) – which are really just a list of common sense suggestions for good mountain walking practice – and a contribution towards the costs of hosting our website (this year set at €2 per person for the season). You will be asked for this when you go along to a walk and given a key fob as a thank you and as a form of receipt. When you walk with us for the first time, we suggest that you call the relevant leader first so they can answer any questions you may have and also make you feel welcome when you arrive. We pride ourselves on being a welcoming and friendly group.
One final point – it’s always worth checking the Stop Press on the front page of our website just in case we have had to make a rare last minute changes to one of our walks. Alternatively if you sign up to our mailing list (via the form below) you will automatically be sent a copy of any Stop Press notices. We do not share your email with any other organisation and you can unsubscribe at any time.

When my kids were little, it became tradition at my house to have “funny” food for one of our April Fools Day meals. For many years I made “Flannel” pancakes. I don’t know why but I fooled my family for probably 5 years in a row with my flannel pancakes.
Now that my kids are grown with kids of their own we continue the tradition but have added additional pranks- my favorite being my delicious Aprils Fools Brownies. Actually they are BROWN- E’s.
To make my delicious Brown-E’s I put a bunch of brown capitol E’s in my special brownie pan and cover it with foil. At the end of dinner I ask everyone if they still have room for a brown-E. This prank has been going on for about 3 years and I’m afraid this year the older grandkids will remember this trick.
Another fun way I’ve fooled my grandkids, which all live with a 1/2 mile of my house, is to put a “For Sale” in my front yard. They didn’t that was very funny and fortunately, neither did our good neighbors.
Put cereal and milk in a bowl and let it freeze overnight. You can freeze it with the spoon in it or not. The next morning right before breakfast, take the bowl out of the freezer and pour a little bit of fresh milk on top.When your hungry kids try to dig in, they’ll find that their cereal won’t budge.
When cooking pancakes put a piece of white flannel, about 3”x3”, into each pancake and cook as usual. Flannel makes pancakes impossible to cut and eaters will become quite frustrated until they realize they’ve been fooled. This is an easy trick to do when serving many people. Put one flannel pancake on a plate with two or three other pancakes.
The night before make some jell-o in clear juice glasses. Use a flavor that matches the juice they drink – such as grape, orange etc. Fill the glass about ¾ full and after it starts to set, insert a drinking straw. Once it is set, it will look like a normal glass of juice with a straw in it. Simply set it at their place at the breakfast table. Provide spoons so they can eat the gelatin when they realize they can’t drink it.
And here’s one more fun idea. Take a few quarters and Gorilla glue them on the sidewalk or walkway leading up to your house. When the grandkids, or your guests, try to pick them up they’re stuck. Warning- the glue will leave a dark spot on your concrete when you pry it off.

Keeping your family hydrated during your family reunion is important and can be a challenge if you are having your reunion outdoors and if you will be encouraging playing sports and other physical activities. You can create a budget and fund for communal beverages, ask everyone to bring their own drinks or try one of ideas below.
Water bottles give you a great opportunity to personalize your water bottles by making labels that support your reunion theme or your family name. Most of our family reunion theme packages include water bottle labels you can easily print and use on your water bottles.
A package of sticker paper can easily be printed on then cut and apply to the water bottles. Get a good quality sticker paper, some of the budget paper aren’t as sticky and may pull away from the water bottle. Sticker paper is great if you won’t keep water bottles in ice but if the water bottles will be stored where they will get wet you should select a sticker paper that is water resistant. You can find water bottle sticker paper in the familyreunionhelper store.
Water bottle labels compliment your reunion or party theme well and they can help save reunion funds and keep your reunion “green” if everyone writes their name on the bottle and reuses the same bottle during the reunion.
A fun idea our family discovered recently are insulated cups from the dollar store. They cost a dollar (surprise) and come in a variety of colors. If you need a lot of cups you will probably want to order them from the store’s online site. They will ship for free to your local store where you can pick them up. Although cups cost more than a water bottle they do make a great souvenir that your family can continue to use when the reunion is over.
My daughter has a vinyl machine and she made a fun logo that we put on all of our cups. They were a hit with the family and with so many cup colors family members were able to easily keep track of their own cups.
An economical way to keep everyone hydrated is to use water coolers. You can purchase a 5 gallon water cooler for around $25.00. Buy several and keep one full of water and ice and one of punch or lemonade. Drink coolers are also great for making homemade root beer. With coolers you can provide paper cups or can use them to refill water bottles or plastic drink cups.
Last but not least, ask everyone to provide their own beverages for the reunion. Asking everyone to provide their own drinks gives some relief to the budget and assures that everyone has their favorite beverage on hand.

Village Health Clinic specializes in healing the whole family, naturally. Our clinic treats conditions specific to all age groups using science-based natural medicines as alternatives to drugs & surgery.
Our services are covered by most health insurance carriers. Coverage needs to be submitted and confirmed by the patient.
Acupuncture is a tradition of medicine that has been practiced for over 5000 years. Traditional therapies are fused with modern science to create a form of medicine that provides balance to the body's systems. Used to stimulate the organ systems, Acupuncture is a successful method of treatment for a variety of health problems including pain, hormonal imbalances, infertility and digestive issues.
Bio identical hormones replacement therapy (BHRT) involves the treatment of hormone deficiencies using hormones that are identical to those naturally produced in the body. Conventional hormone therapy, on the other hand, uses hormones that have been chemically altered so that they can be patented and sold as a drug. It is this chemically altered drug form of hormone therapy that has received much negative attention regarding the side effects associated with hormone therapy.
The goal of Bio identical hormones replacement therapy (BHRT) is to achieve a natural hormone balance in the body resulting in symptom relief and improved well being without the side effects. BHRT is used to treat a variety of hormone deficiencies such as menopause, peri-menopause, hypothyroidism, and adrenal deficiencies. It can also be used to facilitate weight loss and treat infertility, endometriosis, heavy menstrual bleeding, menstrual cramping, premenstrual syndrome, low libido, depression, anxiety, insomnia, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue. Bio identical hormones are made using natural ingredients and available by prescription from local pharmacies.
Dr. Brian Gluvic has over ten years of experience using BHRT. Your appointment with Dr. Brian Gluvic will involve a comprehensive consultation, lab work and physical exam. He will present dietary, nutritional and lifestyle options that will help you achieve hormone balance in the long term and bio identical hormone replacement therapy options to provide more immediate results.

Diet is assessed and modified according to the individual’s needs and the health condition treated. Weight and detoxification can be assessed. Food sensitivity or allergy testing may be recommended and allergy desensitization protocols specified to your needs if required. Nutrition, shopping & cooking guidance is offered. (back to the top)
At the Village Health Clinic, we specialize in science-based natural medical care for children. Starting in infancy we provide comprehensive well baby/child exams where we record your child’s growth and development, perform a full physical exam, and discuss in detail all your parental concerns – such as vaccinations, breast feeding, food introduction, allergy risk reduction, and healthy eating habits. We provide evidence-based dietary and nutritional treatments, along with conventional therapy when required, for common chronic and acute conditions in infancy and childhood – like constipation, eczema, infant reflux, abdominal pain, diarrhea, ADHD, autism, asthma, ear infections and other respiratory infections. Dr. Brian Gluvic has received additional training in naturopathic pediatrics and teaches pediatrics at the local naturopathic medical school. To receive the best in naturopathic medical care for your children, schedule an appointment with us. (back to the top)
Chelation therapy is the administration of specific agents to remove heavy metals from the body. Our clinic provides chelation therapy for patients who have diagnosed heavy metal intoxication. We may also recommend testing for heavy metal intoxication if based on symptoms and environmental factors. (back to the top)
Colon hydrotherapy is an effective treatment for detoxification and restoring regular bowel function. The treatment involves flushing the colon with sterilized water to remove accumulated toxins from the body and stimulate normal bowel activity. The following conditions may respond well to colon hydrotherapy: Constipation, Fatigue, Chronic Pain, Bloating/Gas, Weight Gain, Skin Conditions, Hormone Issues, Irritable Bowel.
The basic treatment for constipation is to increase dietary fiber and water consumption. When this is not enough, we address the underlying cause of constipation, an overstressed and under-functioning bowel. To reduce stress on the digestive tract and restore normal bowel function, we avoid adverse foods reactions with either a hypoallergenic diet or by food allergy testing and utilize a combination of supplemental fibers and nutritional stool softeners. For constipation that does not respond to these dietary and nutritional treatments, we restore normal bowel function with acupuncture, more aggressive digestive support and colon hydrotherapy. Colon Hydrotherapy involves flushing the colon with sterilized filtered water which results in the removal of accumulated toxins and stimulation of bowel activity. (back to the top)
A cleanse, also referred to as a detox, is a supplement and dietary intervention to assist with the body’s elimination of waste products (detoxificaiton). Most people think of cleanse as something you do for a few weeks at a time and perhaps a few times a year. This may temporarily relieve your symptoms of fatigue, bloating, constipation, and headaches but these symptoms often return after the cleanse is completed. The body usually does a pretty good job of detoxification on a daily basis when optimal nutrition is available and when the body is not overwhelmed by dietary, environmental and emotional stressors. If you are feeling toxic and experience fatigue, bowel issues or chronic pain, consider consulting a naturopathic physician to determine your nutritional needs and ways to reduce these stressors on your body. We can formulate a detox program, involving diet, nutrition and perhaps colon hydrotherapy, to get you feeling good now and a maintenance plan towards feeling great for the long term. (back to the top)
As primary care practitioners, Naturopathic physicians perform routine physical exams as a screening process in preventative medical care. Routine exams help screen for risk factors and may include both conventional and specialty testing. A full physical exam is recommended yearly. (back to the top)
Food allergies are adverse immune responses to a food protein. Our clinic provides food allergy testing to properly diagnosis certain health issues. (back to the top)
At the Village Health Clinic, we combine our extentive experience with the latest research and traditional medicines to restore optimal reproductive health. We use evidence based nutritional and diet therapies, herbal medicines, acupuncture and bioidentical hormone replacement therapies to create a customized treatment plan to restore hormone balance, optimise ovarian and uterine function, and ultimately increase fertility. The treatment plan is tailored to support and improve the success rate of assisted reproductive technologies (in vitro fertilization, intrauterine insemination). We also successfully treat conditions that interfere with fertility: endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, fibroids, low ovarian reserve, early menopause, autoimmunity, luteal phase defects, hypothyroidisms, recurrent miscarriage, and male infertility. (back to the top)
Intravenous Medical Nutrition is a method of using vitamins and minerals, along with some herbal medicines, to stimulate healing. IV nutrient therapy bypasses digestive absorption problems and increases the amount of nutrients available in the body. IV nutrient therapy can also be effective in drug dependance rehabilitation/withdrawl (nicotine, caffeine, cocaine, methamphetamines, benzodiazepines...). (back to the top)
Massage therapy treatment both acute and chronic injuries, arthritis, headaches, muscular pain and detoxification of tissues. Massage therapy is also helpful in reducing anxiety, depression, insomnia and stress, utilizing Swedish techniques, trigger point therapy, myofascial release, joint mobilizations, stretching, hydrotherapy, homecare techniques, and patient education. Our registered therapist also offers specialized pre- and post-natal massage.
Midwifery in British Columbia is primary maternity care – from the first prenatal visit until six weeks postpartum. Midwives attend to the needs of women during normal pregnancy and birth, in both a home or hospital setting, providing the majority of health care needs in pregnancy & birth. Midwives are licensed to order laboratory tests and prescribe medications pertinent to maternity care.
Natural childbirth has become the exception, not the standard. Medical and surgical interventions for deliveries have increased exponentially in the last two to three decades in Canada. Epidurals are used in almost half (46%) of all births in Canada. Where as in England, the rate is 12%. Medical inductions have increased from 12% in the 1980s to 20% in 2007. C-section rates have increased from 17.6 to 26.3% from 1993 to 2006. The World Health Organization argues that this rate should be 5-10%.
Pre-birth acupuncture helps to increase your chances of a natural childbirth. Several studies have shown that pre-birth acupuncture reduces labour by 3 – 5 hours and reduces induction rates by 43%. Several studies have shown that pre-birth acupuncture reduces Epidural rates by 31% and C-section rates by 32%. Pre-birth acupuncture helps to ripen the cervix, move the baby into the proper position, increase stamina and resolve other pregnancy related concerns. To learn more about pre-birth acupuncture talk to your Village Health Clinic doctor, midwife, or office assistant. Treatments start at 36 – 37 weeks gestation. (back to the top)
Chronic musculoskeletal pain occurs when ligaments and tendons are damaged. Over time, movement is impaired, which contributes to further damage. Anti-inflammatory medications (Ibuprofen, Advil) are often prescribed to reduce pain, but these ultimately prevent the body’s natural healing process, leading to more damage. With time, surgery is recommended as a last resort. An effective alternative to drugs and surgery is Prolotherapy, which involves injecting a natural solution into the area of the damaged tendons and ligaments. This solution stimulates an inflammatory response, leading to growth and strengthening of the tissue and ultimately reducing pain and restoring motion. The number of treatments required is commonly between 2 and 10, depending on the area affected. (back to the top)
Hydrotherapy (water therapy), colon hydrotherapy, orthopedic exams, functional exercises, and spinal/cervical manipulations may be prescribed for treatment in Sports Medicine. In addition, trigger point injections and topical natural anti-inflammatory preparations may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and promote healing naturally and effectively. (back to the top)
Allergy season is rapidly approaching. Do you remember the itchy eyes, nasal congestion, sneezing fits, coughing, wheezing and resulting fatigue. At the Village Health Clinic we provide an effective treatment and preventive option for allergies – sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT).
SLIT involves daily oral drops of diluted allergen (grass, mold, dust mite, tree pollen, cat dander) taken over several months to reduce symptoms of allergy. SLIT works the same way as allergy injections but without the needles. It is a safe effective treatment that is easy to administer (easier and better tolerated than allergy shots) and much less expensive than allergy shots. Currently it is not common practice in Canada and the US, but it is used extensively for the treatment of allergies in Europe.
A recent review of 63 studies involving 5000 children and adults found strong evidence that sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) works. In these studies, individuals with hay fever or asthma received either SLIT or placebo treatment. Those receiving SLIT had significant improvement in symptoms – reduced coughing, wheezing, nasal discharge, sneezing, and itchy eyes.
Dr. Brian Gluvic is board certified to perform a variety of different types of allergy testing, including skin prick testing. He has years of experience and training with the diagnosis and treatment of allergic conditions and can provide you with evidence-based treatments to improve your allergy symptoms and ultimately improve the function of your immune system. To find out more on how to free your-self from allergies, schedule an appointment and start feeling better! (back to the top)
Some people have difficulty losing weight even with the help of weight loss plans. Others lose weight but can’t keep it off. We specialize in helping all of these individuals. Utilizing a comprehensive approach, we identify the underlying medical, dietary, and nutritional factors that interfere with weight loss. We create a complete dietary, nutritional, and lifestyle plan specific for you that leads to not only dramatic short term weight loss but long term maintenance without feeling deprived. If necessary, we incorporate more aggressive strategies involving nutritional protocols, vitamin injections or hormone therapy (HCG or thyroid support) to facilitate weight loss. Ultimately, your new diet and nutritional plan lead not only to weight loss but more energy and well being - and a new you. (back to the top)
InfoCore's mission is to help you manage your data, keeping it well organized and easily accessible. But what about keeping your data safe and making sure that your data stays YOUR data and isn't either lost or even worse, stolen. The loss of data could have a huge impact on your company. Here are some quick tips that even the least techy person could do to make their data safe. 1. Make sure you back up your data.
There are two things to keep in mind when backing up your data. One is that you want to do it at a regular schedule. The second is that you would like your backups stored at a different location. Once such company, DataDepositBox makes instant online backups whenever your files change. Instead of scheduling your backups once at night, this service actively monitor the directories that you set and makes backups of the files that change as they change. Simply set it and forget it. You'll never have to worry about your backup again. The best part is, that you can retrieve these files from any computer with internet access and the files are stored office site at a secure location.
Although this does sound scary, its really very easy to do these days. Most routers come with a firewall built in. Make sure that your cable or DSL modem is connected to an access point or a wireless router and not directly to your computer.
Make sure you pay for updates and select your virus software to automatically check for updates. Remember, those creating virus, ad-ware, mal-ware, and the such aren't taking breaks and neither can you. Installing your anti-virus software once and then not updating it just wont do these days. Make sure your anti-virus software comes with some kind of spy-ware/ad-ware scanning as well. These spy-ware program can be even more detrimentally than a virus as it most likely will leak your data instead of just destroying it.
One of the most common types of data theft is from stolen laptops. Laptops are becoming more and more common and its scary how much data you probably keep on your laptop. After all, you need that data everywhere you go. If your laptop is stolen, that data is in the hands of someone else. One good feature is making sure your laptop is set up with a user login. It won't stop a good thief, but it will make your data more secure from just anyone happening upon your computer and taking a look at your data. When setting up a login and password, make sure your password is secure enough. Use a combination of letters and numbers and don't use your birth date. The use of the word "password" as your password also isn't as tricky as you might think!
Keeping your data securely "your" data is a constant task. By following these basic steps you will have a good start at protecting yourself against system crashes, corrupted files, or computer crimes.
I know that many of you use Microsoft Access to store your data and run reports. You know you can do more with Access but either you don’t have the time or you just don’t know how to make Access do what you want.Maybe you've been to a training class, but it just didn't cover the topics you needed.
Let InfoCore create a training course based around your office and your needs. Learn the basics of database development and the secrets of Microsoft Access, that will empower you to build powerful database solutions for your office.
In September and December 2014 the held enquiries into the Ebola response. They are currently looking at what the international community is doing to improve the international response for future disease outbreaks.
To support the Committee, , hosted by Foto-Cewek, submitted written evidence based on their experience in Liberia. COUNTDOWN has partners in Ghana, Nigeria, Cameroon and in Liberia our work is led by the Ministry of Health.
That the Ebola outbreak became so significant in post-conflict countries is no surprise. COUNTDOWN's donor DFID has made a commitment to better understanding and supporting the health system development of states which have been affected by conflict and crisis as evidenced by their support of the ReBUILD research programme consortium. COUNTDOWN research in Liberia enables us to complement this learning through the lens of NTDs.
Pre-existing health investments in Ebola-affected countries should be used to lever system-wide improvements in health. As we move from an emergency response to one that is focussed on building the long-term sustainability of the health and other systems these foundational investments become more critical to progress and support for national leadership. We should not scale back support to under-funded and weakened health systems such as those in Liberia. Rather existing government led health programmes – such as the programme for Neglected Tropical Diseases - can provide an entry point for strengthening areas of the system outside their mandate. For example in the deployment of community health workers.
Alongside the implementation of health programmes we need a strengthened focus on research, both to guide implementation and to provide lessons on post-Ebola health system reconstruction for other countries.
A DFID co-funded post-Ebola Programmatic Assessment suggests people at all levels want the NTD programme to roll out. The DFID funded Filarial Programme Support Unit has conducted a mapping with MAP International, Sight Savers and APOC at the national level, in two districts in each county, two communities in each district (one that had Ebola and one that didn’t) and in five health centres per county. Formal findings from the study will be published soon. Initial analysis shows that there is commitment and demand for the NTD programme at all levels. Indeed colleagues have pointed to the importance of intensified social science inputs into the NTD programme post-Ebola. For example there will need to be intensified social mobilisation in relation to Mass Drug Administration for schistosomiasis as community members have become wary of treatment as the side effects (occasional vomiting and diarrhoea) are known to be reminiscent of Ebola symptoms. Parents are understandably keen to protect their children from potential Ebola-stigma and work is needed to allay these fears.
Support to enable Ebola-affected countries to share lessons, through learning platforms and financing for meetings and longer-term partnership and dialogue is also vital. Through these processes appropriate capacity exchange can take place which is nationally owned rather than donor mediated.
As countries emerge from the Ebola crisis it is beholden on us as researchers, donors and policy makers to work in solidarity to strengthen health systems and communities which have experienced traumatising and sometimes devastating shocks. Disasters, crises, and revolutions all happen in real life and it is difficult to predict where they might occur. This is not a reason for ceasing operations. Rather implementation research in Liberia (and settings like it) can provide models for the health system response when similar problems emerge elsewhere in Africa.

the title for this post has a double meaning. firstly it’s a reflection of how I am feeling, how re-energised and excited I am to be mixing up the training. I’ve obviously recovered from the ultra, and am now enjoying doing (much) shorter sessions, running relatively little, and giving swimming and cycling a go. the swimming […]
yesterday and today are two very contrasting days; last night saw me in my comfort zone, a club running session at Perry Lakes involving a warm-up, stretching, drills and then a 2km time trial (which will act as a benchmark for later in the course). with the “3 steps” still in my legs, the time […]
so just over a week ago I started the 10 week novice course with the Perth Triathlon Club – this marked the start of a new phase in training, new goals and a new chapter in my personal story. I have to say that so far I am really loving it. we haven’t had a swim […]
I just thought that it would be good to hear some more personal things about the people here. Dont be silly!
I am 17 years old living in Budapest, Hungary, Europe. I am living with my parents. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister. [My sister is 15 years old, my brothers are 19 and 21. -> My brothers are also playing Doms 2.]
I am a student in Budapest. This is my last year in school, I will start to work in my father's nightclub after the school is over.
My hobbies are sports [fighting sports like aikido, kickboxing and kempo. I am learning those for more then 4 years now]
I am very lucky, because I can train with excellent fighters, like world champion kickboxer Jozsef Tumbasz. Here is a little picture about him: Jozsef Tumbasz
I also like to play computer games [FPS, RTS, TBS and MMORPGs], however I have much less time now to play then before.
"Training is principally an act of faith. The athlete must believe in its efficacy: he must believe that through training he will become fitter and stronger, that by constant repetition of the same movements he will become more skillful."
Many interests, history, recent happenings, mythology, sciences, art, computer games, programming and the list goes on...
I haven't seen one of these threads here before... I wonder if it will be moved to Shrapnel General or something.
Any way, I'm a male Finn, currently 18 years old. I live in the Eastern Finland, in an area that is mostly forest. I live 50 km from Kitee, and few hundred kilometers from the city of Joensuu that is named after me. I had my final exams this spring. I have known Illwinter for a long time, from since the whole company was Bogus. Bogus Game Design, that is. I never bought Conquest of Elysium 2, and couldn't order Dom:PPP, so I waited for a long time. I used to read awfully lot of fantasy literature, but haven't read any actual classic literature. For the last 3-4 years, I have started spending more and more time on my computer, and started a form of martial arts to keep fit. I would like to do or learn multitude of things, including pen&paper roleplaying, LARP, classical (sport) fencing, historical fencing, actually hit things with my sling, fight with a quarterstaff, draw, play an instrument (something simple like a recorder would do), do something serious with my computer, speak Latin etc. I know some Java, I can take a computer apart and can usually put it together, I don't listen to much music, drink, smoke or go out more than few times a week, and I've started dabbling in 3d-graphics via free Blender3d. I have completed ADOM once. Other keywords: Mount&Blade, Dominions, Planescape: Torment, Betrayal at Krondor, (Linley's) Dungeon Crawl, old games (X-COM, Ur-Quan Masters, original PoP, MoM, UltIV), (Disney's) The Gargoyles,
Finally, too many words about my final exams. Even if this will at least double the length of this message, I've been wanting to write this stuff for a long time, and it will probably fit this thread the best. The grades are I, A, C, M, E, L from latin words (improbatur, approbatur, cum laude... laudatur). I means failure, and L a near-perfect score that is usually calculated to be 5% of all the gymnasium-graduating Finns of the year. I got C from Finnish and Mathematics , M in Philosophy and Swedish, and an L from English. About these:
Finnish, C: I wrote two essays; one too short, the second so long I didn't properly finish it. Why do we have to re-write everything with pens and not pencils, again? I have done much better earlier, and especially my last essay before the final two was very good.
Mathematics, C: The maths I wrote was the kind of maths which has derivation, integral calculations, vectors in three-dimensional space etc. It is hard, so I'm happy with my C.
Philosophy, M: I belonged to the first group that could write philosophy on its own, and I didn't take it very seriously. I didn't get the points from the 'Define philosophy in few words and examine your definition' answer that was along the lines of 'Philosophy is maths - in closer examination, it isn't.' On the other hand, my longer definition and examination brought full points, and I got 7 points from the extra-hard 9-point question.
Swedish, M: I had hard time in Swedish for a long time, but I got much better in it during the last year. I was 4 points short of E, and that makes me very proud. Jag kan inte tala mycket svenska, men jag kan skriva de h�r orden och s�ga, att Illwinter �r det b�sta!
English, L: As far as the English goes... I wrote an English essay, re-read it, realized it was too far removed from the original title, and re-wrote it in a bit of a hurry. I got 97 points from the re-write. I'm that good, I'm very proud of it, and you are one of the reasons I am so good at English. Fun fact: I can't speak or pronounce English.
Oh and btw I dont think that this thread should be moved to an other forum, because I've made it for Doms 3. players.
37 year old pharmacist in Virginia. Been gaming since I was 11 years old. Started with Basic D&D blue book. Then progressed to Avalon Hill board wargames. Been selling my hundreds of games on eBay as I do all of my gaming on the computer now. Dominions 2 is my favorite computer game.
I'm 24, completed an apprenticeship as a computer system developer and now I'm studying biology. I want to focus on bioinformatics, but there's some time left until I have to make that decission.
I actually like boardgames and tabletop games (Game of thrones and Confrontation are my favourites), love to read fantasy (A song of ice and fire series). My favourite RPG is the Fading Sun universe, it's amazing how they managed to create such a realistic vision of life in the year 4000.
I'm a long-time gamer dating back to Pong, the Atari 2600 and original Basic D&D. I love all types of games - cardgames, boardgames, RPG, videogames - you name it.
I'm an avid reader - especially intrigue, mystery, and adventure. I also read a lot of fantasy, though that's tapered off the last 5 years or so. Though I am a huge Tolkien fan - not just the Trilogy, but his lesser known works as well, and biographies about him.
The were some posts like this in the Dom2 forum. OK I'm 50, male, retired military living in California, USA.
Ive been on the net since before it was Internet. Ive worked at most jobs for Internet providors (customer service, sales, system admin, netcop). Now I run my own servers out of my house.
Most of my day is centered around my handicapped son. Other than that I get to work from home on internet jobs. Since I have a retirement check and full medical I dont HAVE to work so I can take jobs that interest me. Sysadmin work on servers, computer forensics (examining computers after a break-in), working with charities and organizations. And of course games.
I host various games things thru my servers. A MUD, an Ultima Online shard, and of course games like Dominions. Ive got a dozen web sites and about a 100 users. I provide the web hosting, email, ftp, etc. I hope I never have to go back to using the internet with limits.
This game is NOT suitable for students, interns, apprentices, or anyone else who is expected to pass tests on a regular basis. Do not think about strategies while operating heavy machinery. Before beginning this game make arrangements for someone to check on you daily. If you find that your game has continued for more than 36 hours straight then you should consult a physician immediately (Do NOT show him the game!)
I'm 17 years old, male and live in Finland and more accurately in a puny city/town called Lahti. I go to the second grade of senior high school or gymnasium as it goes somewhat unaccurately translated
I read fantasy books, but since the school is the priority now I have left it for the summer vacation. (2 days more school left) I play tradiotional RPG's with and without a spesific rule system. Now I've found the "realistic" systems to be very cumbersome and use light or no system. Systems that I have used: GURPS, WOD, Praedor and some nicer freeware systems.
As for computer games I mostly play strategy games since I haven't found as much fullfilment in the computer RPG's than in the traditional ones. Some games: Dom: PPP, ADOM, Rome and Medieval Total War, SPWAW, Europa Universalis II, Fallout and Sid's Alpha Centauri.
I've LARPed (don't know the correct verb ) and been interested and have done things that closely relate to it for several years (archery, costume making, fencing etc.) But mostly I just participate games. It may seem as a very silly hobby but it's actually entertaining even on deeper levels.
I'm interested in history of all ages and especially in the era from the Renaissance to the Imperialism. But the most interesting matters to me are philosophy and social studies. I have very strong political opinions, which I don't want to go them through here to avoid quarrels. And I listen to classical/historical music.
I've added "En Sabana Grande siempre es de día" (1988) to the database. However, I haven't included the link to the IMDb page for this movie. Just so that people know why, my policy is that I don't include the link to the IMDb page whenever the latter contains definite factual errors - as in the case of this film where it muddles the actors. (In fact, the poster displayed on the IMDb page identifies the boy actors - "...y la actuación de los niños..." - and IMDb still gets it wrong!) A little online research on Spanish language sites revealed the correct credits.
I'm having some issues with trainz 12 at the moment. for some reason I cannot save routes. I keep getting a message saying "session saved but surveyor was unable to commit to the trains assert database".
If its the same as 2009, then go into Content Manager and you'll find your route is "Open for Edit". Commit it there and it will be saved!
I've found a database repair has fixed the issue. I did also commit the asset in the open for edit section of content manager

Which European soccer team is the most fun to watch? Which team has the most boring style that somehow wins games? And which player acquisitions and managerial moves yield the most enchanting new dynamics for an already-powerful club?
Perhaps most importantly , which matches this season will be unexpected delights from a purely artful perspective? While they aren’t definitive by any means, these watchability scores will help determine the answers, as they’re based on four factors that collectively account for the sport’s main areas of action: dribbling, passing, defending, and shooting.

We hear your voicemail answers to last month's puzzler question regarding Larry, who thinks windmills are downright ugly.
You are chatting with a neighbor. Let's call her Joan. Joan has family in Florida who were affected by Hurricane Irma. You start talking about climate change and the connections you see to these current weather events. Joan interrupts you, "No you are wrong. Climate change has nothing to do with these hurricanes. They have always had hurricanes. Scientists make it clear that there is no way you can say climate change has anything to do with these storms."
So, is Joan right? How can you effectively and accurately talk about these weather events and climate change?
Get back to Peterson by November, 15, 2017. You can also email your answers to radio @ citizensclimate.org or leave a voicemail of 3 minutes or less at 570.483.8194. (+1 if calling from outside the USA.)
What do people of color concerned about climate change and environmental impacts to their communities want white climate advocates to know? What roles do climate organizations with mostly white members play in environmental justice work? How do you define "the environment," and what is climate justice? Today we take on a big story. Bigger than any single extreme weather event, we explore the topics of environmental justice and climate justice. We look at how injustice in society, particularly in the USA, deepens suffering during a time of climate change. Peggy Sheppard, the co-founder and executive director of WE ACT For Environmental Justice and Dr. Beverly G Ward, Field Director for Earthcare for the Southeastern Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, talk about their work pursuing environmental and climate justice.
We did not want to rush the conversations with our guests, so we do not include an Art House segment or a new puzzler. Peterson will share the answers from last month's puzzler on Ep 17. You still have time to send in your answers.
You are chatting with an acquaintance, let's call him Larry. Somehow you get to talking about windmills and the rapid advances in renewable technology. Larry is sympathetic but bothered by something. He says to you, Yeah, I understand that these windmills can help to get us off of coal and gas, but they look so ugly! I hate how they are destroying the countryside.
So What would you say to Larry? Try to think of something that will open up the conversation and get him to better understand climate change. Get back to Peterson by October, 15, 2017.

Recently some climate communication experts have been freaking out about freaking out. In reaction to a New York Magazine article, The Uninhabitable World, by David Wallace-Wells, a big debate is raging about fear tactics when talking about climate change. We look at the different sides and some of the social science around fear and rhetoric. Joining host, Peterson Toscano, is Halldor Björnsson, the Head of the Atmospheric Research Group at Veðurstofa Iceland also known as the Icelandic Met Office. Also, we hear from Dr. Kristian Bjørkdahl who has earned a PhD in rhetoric and continues his studies at the Centre for Development and the Environment, at the University of Oslo. Oh, and Aristotle makes a surprise cameo appearance.

Using metaphor to talk about climate change is very important. We can relate the effects of climate change or our response to it to our own lives in many ways, including our childhood experiences. So here is your puzzler question: Fill in the blank. When I think about climate change, it reminds me of when ___________ Think back to your childhood. The memory may have absolutely nothing to do with climate change. It might be aobut a loss you experienced, a sudden change in your life, or a revelation about your role in the world. When I think about climate change, it reminds me of when _________. Fill in the blank and explain.

Our individual values shape us. They help us make decisions and influence our relationships. They keep us on the right path. Organzitions and movements are also be guided by values. As climate advocates, we come to this work with our own set of values. Citizens' Climate Radio host, Peterson Toscano speaks with marketing researcher and volunteer climate advocate, Lesley Beatty about the Citizens' Climate Lobby's Core Values. CCL founder Marshall Saunders joins in the conversation with a burst of optimism.
Marshall Saunders sticks around to help with our Art House segment. He has a book recommendation to share, a novel written in 1899 by Leo Tolstoy. Marshall tells us why he thinks climate advocates should read Tolstoy's Resurrection. South African author, Glen Retief reads excerpts from the novel.

How do some people land on a path that leads them to climate action? Host, Peterson Toscano explores this question by featuring two passionate climate advocactes. Dr. Hugh Sealy, is an environmental engineer in the Caribbean. He has influenced environmental policy in Barbados, Grenda, St. Lucia, and Dominica. In addition to his work in helping low-lying island nations in a time of climate change, Dr. Sealy also served as a member of the Clean Development Mechanism or CDM for the UN Framework on Climate Change. He shares some of his story, discusses the CDM carbon pricing. Adia Samba-Quee, is just begining her career as a climate advocate. A 14 year old student in Springfield, MA, Adia makes connection between local pollution, asthma, and climate action. She hopes to use comedy to engage people in deeper conversations about climate.
We travel back to the future to hear from climate historian, Dr. Timothy Meadows. He broadcasts from the year 2176 to look back to our time. In this segment he highlights the incredible acheivements of three engineers known as The Three Beans. Starting around 2028 they made their mark as creative and skilled designers of major adaptation projects. They also operated with style and playfulness. The Three Beans stirred up hope in a difficult time. They became three of the biggest celebrities of the mid-21st Century. Hear from an eye-witness from the future and also discover what they are advertizing 150 years from now.
Last month Peterson asked listeners, In addition to the welcome of animal species and future generations, why are you passionate about climate change/ We hear from listener, Dr. Stephen Hanson who talks about climate change and health. Dave Barbier, the Sustainability coordinator for University of Wisconsin in Stevens Point, connects climate action with national security.
You are talking to someone named Barbara. You helped her see that climate change is a serious issue that needs her attention. Barbara then asks you, What should I do next? This is the question climate communicators long to hear. So what do you say when someone wants to know more about climate change? What are resources you recommend that help people better undertstand the issues and how we can respond? Tell me about books, websites, video series, podcasts, and more.

Storytelling is a vital skill to have when talking about climate change. In this episode podcst host, Peterson Toscano, introduces you to Aaron Thier, a master storyteller. In his book Mr. Eternity, novelist Aaron Thier takes readers on a 1,000 year odyssey. The main character calls himself Daniel Defoe. We never learn his real name. Old Dan can't seem to die. Five different narrators in five different periods from 1500 to 2500 bump into this traveler. The book is brilliant, hilarious, deeply moving, weird. It is essential reading for climate advocates. Learn why Aaron wrote the book and the challenges novelists face when telling climate stories. Aaron also reads extended excerpts from the book.
Joining us in the Art House is Clara Fang. Clara is a writer, environmentalist, and a photographer currently based in Detroit, Michigan. She is also the higher education liaison at Citizen’s Climate Lobby.
Her poems have been published in numerous journals. She has been nominated for a Pushcart Prize. She won The Lyric poetry contest, and was a finalist for the Benjamin Saltman Poetry Award. Clara was born in Shanghai, China and immigrated to the United States when she was nine years old. She reads the poem, Love in the Time of Climate Change.
We feature two excellent answers to Crusty Ole Charlie's complaint that we can't "play nice" when dealing with business and government.
Believe it or not many people are not all that concerned about animal extinction or the plight of future generations. For them there needs to be another climate hook--one that is closer to home. So here is your question: Besides the welfare of animal species and future generations, why are you passionate about climate change?

Politicians don’t create political will, they respond to it. We believe citizens who are well-trained, organized and with a good system of support can more than influence the political process. We invite you to live into the opportunity that democracy offers, and in exercising that right as citizens, lift your nation to the task at hand on global warming and climate change, that of protecting our ability to live on planet Earth.

Moor Road Recreation Ground in Farnborough is set to be transformed by Rushmoor Borough Council with proposals for a new playground, a multi-use games area, a skate park and an outdoor gym – to create a welcoming new park for local families and young people.
The long-term vision for the project could also include a bike skills course, a BMX track, a youth shelter and a new community hall and café, improved car parking and a picnic and barbecue area.
The ambitious project will be subject to planning permission and will cost around £1.2m to complete.
“We are delighted that Rushmoor Borough Council is prepared to invest nearly £800,000 in this wonderful project for our neighbourhood,” said Cllr Clive Grattan, Chairman of the Prospect Estate Big Local (PEBL) and a Councillor for Cherrywood Ward, Farnborough.
“We in PEBL are fortunate to have access to Big Lottery funds that we can allocate to this sort of project for the benefit of residents of the Prospect Estate.
“Moor Road Recreation Ground provides a great opportunity to achieve our aims for the future, including the Fitness Walk along Cove Brook.”
The Council already has £270,000 of Section 106 funds, which have been paid to the Council by developers of new homes in the area and can be used to improve and provide open space. The Council will submit a bid to Sport England’s Community Asset Fund for £150,000 and to the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme for £60,000 with a further £40,000 potentially available from PEBL.
If all this money can be secured, the Council would have £520,000 to complete the playground, outdoor gym, skate park and multi-use games area, starting next year.
Additional facilities would be to come at a later stage, subject to securing other external funding.
About twice a year this topic comes up and it's only a few people who want the change, and although they're extremely loud about it and almost obnoxious, the majority of the forum wants things to stay the way it is.
you mean someone posted his pic and he was some ugly ass motherfucker who obviously hasnt been laid?
or he was afraid someone would identify him and didnt want his information spread to family/friends?
99% of the time, "problems" here are common sense. There's never a discussion, just an insistance that each person who types a post is right. Nobody is open to new ideas, even thread starters already have the words they want to hear thought out before they hit "submit thread" and if anyone posts anything other than that, there's another argument. Opinions expressed by the forum are not done in a respectful, positive way but rather in a "lets see who can bitch slap this kid into Tuesday the best" kinda way.
Further, we've got people who think it's funny to post bullshit threads preying on the good nature of this forum, we have people who find is more wise to ask GenMay than to ask their parents or their doctors. Sometimes you just really need to back it up and realize that this isn't right.
What's wrong with you people? This is the Bone Closet. The one good old school thread we had was met with jeers, sneers and negativity. I mean a guy who cheats on his girlfriend and knocks another girl up gets more support than anyone with a creative mind.
Meanwhile ya'll are splitting hairs over a "should I stay in school" thread, bitching and complaining whining and crying that this place sucks when I don't see a single one of you making good threads, valid contributions or doing your part to create any sense of community.
I am really not in the mood, but in the next week or so just for you I will write some erotica. Probably.
It is a public forum. Anyone with internet access in the world outside of china can access it and read it.

Moral? Saying something in here is more public than standing on a street corner and confessing you suck too much cock or are a guy and like it in the arse. At least there is does not linger on the net for the rest of eternity.
i see you missed where i wrote that people post in the bone closet for "the illusion of comfort and privacy"
they dont, in my opinion. but if jynus stopped posting because he thinks he's ugly and his picture was posted, then isn't that just a huge irony to all the things he's said? you gotta admit, if that's the case, it's pretty comical.
i hate to say "omg but i've been posting good things! look at my posts!" but i'm pretty sure i've only posted when i felt i was offering sincere advice or data, and wasn't just stroking my ego or flaming or thread derailing.
i miss the good old threads too. but those are only gonna come around once in a blue moon when it happens to someone and they post about it.
i'd hate for you to think i'm really "bitching." i just have an opinion that others seem to agree with (of course i dont know if theres a majority or minority, since only a few members seem to be posting about the subject at all).
i appreciate reason over demands, but the tone of your posts has shown me that you have no interest in further discussion. i dont care enough about this to throw up much more of a stink, and its only times like now when i even get motivated at all to post about it. i'd hope in the future that you are as much or more open to discussion and reason than less - and that telling people to shut up in the designated thread for pitching fits gets more rare as time goes on
Rebel Without a Cause is a highly serious drama about teenagers whose parents either don't understand them or just don't care about them. This causes unhappiness and eventually tragedy. James Dean, Sal Mineo and Natalie Wood give great performances as the frustated youths in this once controversial film. I was moved by it.
I went to see City of God last night at AUC. Boy am I glad I live in Cairo, not Rio de Janeiro. Although I really wouldn't mind switching Egyptian girls (as well as football players) with Brazilians. Seriously, anyone complaining about Cairo should go watch that frickin' movie.
I went abit early to AUC, so I went to catch the Maghrib prayer at the musalla on campus. I was surprised, the tiny musalla is almost a complete little mosque now. Didn't I say that AUC has transformed. I then went down to the platform area and watched all the Americanized students hanging around. Was fun to watch.
The movie theater was packed, mostly foreigners, mostly Americans. I wondered again; what are all those foreigners doing in Cairo?! (I think I'll write about that here soon).
I went to AUC straight from work, so I decided to get a bite to eat. For some reason I felt like eating McDonald's. I haven't been eating there for something close to 3 years now. Wasn't boycotting the place or anything. If you know anything about me, you should know that I love food, and I'd never politicize it. Hell, I love bagels. Toasted with cream cheese, yummy. Isn't it originally Jewish or something. Well, they (Israelis) can take all my land and exterminate my family, I'm still gonna eat bagels (only if I can find it in Cairo). So why did I stop eating McDonald's for so long? Oh, its just lousy food, and not just because its fast food. It actually tastes like slime, and even smells terrible, and I don't know what they put on their fries, sugar or fat, its just all very disgusting. Their meals really have nothing to do with food. You read how they do their food, and then you're really done with it. Can't even think about it anymore. What I can't understand is how they're spreading like wild mushrooms everywhere! even in Egypt!! Egyptian food just rocks, and I can't imagine why Egyptians would endorse such a low standard of food.
Having been to both places, I think it really depends on where you live. Although I think that places like the Northern Cemetary are surprisingly better off than some Rio favelas (slums). At least they can go to the beach in Rio, though.
True ofcourse, depends on where you live in the city. But having only seen the movie (I wish I can make it there sometime), there is not a single area in Cairo that I cannot walk in, while its obvious from the film that I wouldn't dare walk in an area like that "City of God".
I've had the movie on my computer for almost a month now, but I didn't find enough time to watch it :(
I haven't been to Euro Deli in Zamalek in awhile, but I know the Beirut location carried a very diverse selection of quality bagels. They deliver.
As for the hordes of American Arabic students (I'm one) in Cairo, the majority are wannabe journalists and academics. Most of the others are just kids spending a semester abroad - hey they've been going to Barcelona and London for years - why not Cairo. There are a few who are probably seeking military careers or alphabet-agency careers, but don't worry about them.
There's a right-wing American girl I know who went to study in Amman for a semester. Before she left, she was also touting the "What's Wrong with Islam" books and mass-market paperback about some princess or another who lived a terrible life in Saudi Arabia. Now back, she spends half her time defending Arabs and Muslims - although she'll still probably end up in the military.
I'm working on a story on Egyptian bloggers for Cairo Magazine. Will be in touch - anonymity assured.
Hey wannabe journalist (or are you something else?), thanks for the Deli reference. I'll make sure to check it out.
I'm not worried about the foreigners spending time here. Don't get me wrong. I'm glad to see some different faces around. I'll explain more when I post about it. I think I'll try to categorize them like you've done, but I'm sure I'll miss some, so make sure to pitch in.

We accomplished that one back in April, crashing the biggest account in OGame incidentally, and from then on we started to gradually drop away from the game. This day was inevitable. The only question was when.
To ask about when, we had to have some sort of trigger for us all to look back and reflect, and then decide to do this. I'll discuss that shortly but there are a few other events that drew us towards this conclusion too. In no specific order: the decision to erase the OGame archives, the unfair bans Unity started receiving (including my own ban a few weeks back which had no explanation attached), and the dismissal without warning of some of our longest serving mods and game operators in what could only be described as a power grab. As well as this Umakhelwane's rank was outright depressing for us to deal with. However, this accumulated into our final decision with that trigger I just mentioned...
Since I wrote this first part a lot has happened, and well goes to confirm a few things we thought that added to our reasons to quit. In short, the immediate change in certain players' status' and allegiances.
The trigger was simply enough, Blackmass' account being hacked (I won't name names but we all know who). This combined with the lacklustre response in trying to get it fixed made us think. Actually, what's the point if this could happen. Why not end the game on our terms instead? And that's exactly what we did.
I'd show you the rest but one of us can't do technology to save their life and, well... I had to submit a ticket to get it done because the button didn't work
Tirnoch built practically everything but 17k of the rips and some speedfleet, kaldor rebuilt most of the fleet + a good chunk extra, proangel built everything from 0, Firestorm built a good chunk of the fleet, Kaldor & Mindwar together built Mindwar's account in this hit, even I built literally all of it after scrapping the speed that was on it and farming the scrapped losses back
But anyway, don't think I'll be spending a lot of time here anymore, I'm way too busy trying to find my fleet...
Whatever you do, good luck. Goes without saying that this thread will be watched and policed heavily. Consider this your only warning.
So, yeah it's been a week since the hits so it's kinda meh already. It's taken so long partly because Kaldor felt like writing an essay (I'm glad we could stop him from writing a book), but also we kinda didn't want to post what happened before our accounts were deleted, or else all the tinfoil hat theorists would make up all kinds of conspiracy theories as to how this is a masterplan to push me or Kaldor or w/e.
So no, sorry to disappoint you, but there is no master plan behind all this. It's very simple. We decided to quit, wanted to do a final epic bang, and here we are.
I won't bore you too much with my personal reasons why I quit. To be honest, the "hacking" of Blackmass' account was not the trigger for me, I know very well that most of the time these so called hacks are nothing but the own fault of the one being "hacked" and I totally understand why there is no personal backups for cases like that.
No, the reason for quitting is fairly simple. OGame for me has always been something I didn't really play for a long period of time but only for few months. This time this period was extended to almost 2 years, far too long for me. And I only stayed for the team. Once it was clear the team wanted to quit as a whole, the next step was obvious.
As I'm writing this I already see the "waste of someone else's hard work" posts. Well firstly, that is none of your business, Kaldor and me have progressed these accounts far enough to be able to claim them our "own hard work". I took my old account with 15m points back in March 2015 and progressed it to 65m points until the merger with a break of few months, then built 140m military on it until November 2016 where I scrapped it into the Limecat account. The night where we quit I spent all resource reserves I had on the account and was at 825m points in total. So don't tell me I'm wasting the hard work of someone else. Secondly, don't worry, the original owners are aware of what happened and they are, surprise surprise, totally fine with it.
Now, the recent events since Unity left the stage make me laugh to be honest. So there are a few things I would like to say..
War Machine.. when I first started in Uni 35, I think it was 2008 or 2009, I was a small miner in IMPERIAL. I remember how you caught my cargo fleet on an own DF return while I was playing Dota and forgot to recall the fleet before it hit the DF. You timed the fleet by 6 seconds, I believe to give me a chance to escape and to teach me a lesson. You were on good terms with NINJA and he instantly PM'd me asking if I would FS to own DF. I managed to save my fleet, and I had since then huge respect for you. Then, I took my account back with 15m and returned to Uni 35 with the intention to peacefully mine a bit again. But then came nirO, and we both ended up on opposing sides. Close to the merge, some time had passed since the last hostile actions between you/nirO and me, I decided to try and ease the tention between us, and I PM'd you asking if you'd like to be a beta tester for v6 of Antigame (note for those who don't know: I was the developer of AGO until few days ago). You gave me a not so nice respond and blocked me. The merge came, and I had to choose a side, and Kaldor and Firestorm asked me to join LOS (later to be Unity).
And in all this time, I was asking myself why it isn't possible that we are enemies ingame, but still can talk respectfully to eachother. Why is it so hard to show a bit of respect to your enemies? Even now, after we quit, you can't stand up and say "good game". I really wish we could talk with eachother, and laugh about the past, tell stories to eachother how we setup traps for eachother that didn't work out and so on.. But you are not able to do that, and that is why I fought RIO from the beginning. And there is still no CR with me on the wrong side, apart from what you see in this thread. Guess it feels bad, when the opponent you weren't able to do anything against just vanishes, without giving you the possibility to get your revenge?
Which leads me to my next point. WM's new signature. Now, if you consider it a victory hiding and waiting in vmode until the opponent dies because of boredom and quits, then yes, you're right, you defeated Unity. But personally, I think that's a rather foolish thought. Unity crashed you legitimately and put you on the top of all hits worldwide. And with Unity quitting, I guess you'll stay there for a looooooong time
Then, dear Quantum. I watched the recent events in Quantum a bit and it really made me laugh. Do you realize, what happened? Do you realize, that while you all were accusing Unity of pushing/cheating because of 2 deep space hits and 1 account scrap, RIO was acquiring half of the universe, WM using high ranked miner accounts to merch all res to deut, trading it 1:1 for crystal, then merching that crystal to deut again and repeating that process, and scrapping accounts subtly, growing 80bn points with 150.000 military destroyed and so on? Do you realize what happened? You all were fooled, you all fell for RIO's lies. Now all accounts get renamed to RIO members and join RIO, how long do you think will it take that LEGIO and Xing Xong will rename to nirO and unclesam or whichever RIO member acquired them?
Now enjoy Quantum under the domination of RIO. After Unity hit WM, we had decided not to go and MD everyone, and we didn't. We wanted people to actually play and enjoy the game. All the vmoders could've played out of vmode and FS just fine. But they didn't. Now enjoy how every single one of you will be hunted down, until there is nothing left other than RIO.
Now I have written an essay myself, sorry for that. I wish all of you all the best, enjoy OGame while it's still fun for you. And RIO, enjoy being finally Rank 1, you waited (no really, literally waited) a long time for this moment.
If anyone wants to have a chat with me about all the things that happened, without lies, feel free to PM me your Skype name. I'm open to all questions.
PS. If you were wondering why my account was banned, I filed a ticket and asked for a ban, since all the DF was harvested by me, and everyone involved in the hits were lower ranked than me.
I could write a rather long post going in depth on why half of what you said is either lies or just stupidity but I wont. Half because I don't want to and it doesn't matter since you all quit anyways, and half because you will just outright deny it regardless of the truth.
2) Its very easy to take credit for building an account when you either A) Acquire it from someone else or B) Scrap the living hell out of half the uni to grow close to 100m+ a month
3) We're aware of all the cheating that goes on, on both sides RIO and Unity. The difference is the blatant cheating done weekly, the continuous denial of it despite it being obvious, the arrogance, the hypocritical accusations done on the boards while acting completely innocent yourselves, and the complete ban evasion while having half your ally as GO's or higher.
4) You go on and on about how you are different or better than RIO yet in many way you are worse. Since when does RIO fly 50K+ dessies for a loss or near 1k rips for 3-5kk profit? I've played in both Q and 35 for many years and never awoke to as much probe spam, rip raids, and flashing red triangles as I did in just the last month of Q.
At the end of the day, Best of luck in real life to all of you. Uni is dying but that doesn't matter if you are a miner
I never denied scrapping my old account into the Limecat account, I even said it in my post. But that was about it. Can you name another account I/Unity scrapped?
Your post is just a prime example of what I was talking about in my post. "OOOMMMMGGG UNITY CHEATING BASTERDS!!!!1111" just because of 2 deep space hits and 1 account scrapped.
2) It's very easy to take credit for building an account when literally everyone can build mines, like you, but it's way harder to keep fleets alive
3) Blatant cheating done weekly through metal merching & ripraids, also ignoring that SGO's and GO's do NOT and will NEVER have access in the uni's they play in (Also casually ignoring all the bans Unity has gotten past few months for trades that weren't past 72hours or account trades(The account switched from the UK to the USA! Must be account sharing!)
4) It's been long since known that profit is overrated and trying to crash and farm whoever supplies your 'enemy' with deut and metal is way more efficient than trying to catch a VModer
not a quantum player...but the moment account changes hand its for the new owner to decide what he wants to do..
You remember when I asked you why you scrapped your account? What did you answer? I'm quitting, after 2 or 3 days I was made aware that you merched all the resources to 65G deut... at least RIO don't lie.
Kaldor got his account with 100G+ resources on it, plus made a few deep space hits & maybe merched as well... and the fleet is still similar to what Solidarity had, so yea... it's Solidarity's hard work.
As for you, you put on 65G deut on your account, and the Limecat had resources as well on it, so i'm not sure where do you get your fairy tales... just by building a little fleet on it by scrapping your old fleet in to it and doing some deep space hit doesn't make the account yours.
You like to compare yourself with RIO members, right? and you being the saint ofcourse. Well, if I go and ask unclesam if he scrapped or bought an account, he'll just say yes or just ignore the message... whereas Tirnoch here lies about it. most
The firestorm account had 3 accounts scrapped into it and many many top 10 hits to make his fleet that size. He just acquired the account, nothing more nothing less, it's still considered as Lucifer's account.
The rest of your post contains so much wrong information, I won't even reply to that. Basic trolling like we're used to from you, Mike.
would love to have seen the chat within NBT the moment they realized they are now the only fleeting ally worth hunting for RLO, with no Unity to keep them at bay, but hey, WM! you can idle now without risking your fleet again =D as you have acquired any and all accounts strong enough to make a dent on you. GG
After over 10 years of playing Ocrack, you really are going to be happy with "real life", yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah, don't think so..
Personally, I've always preferred RIO (i'm not in quantum) as i've been a WM fan since U35, but it will be sad if the rivalry is over. Rivalry is what spurs us to become inventive in our approach and makes the game more interesting.
So, you all suicided fleets that you aquired? yes well done!! Don't think anyone cares that you're all leaving but yourselves. You ruined Quantum, WM isn't totally innocent but hell, at least he built that account. Solidarity and Limecat spent years on those accounts, okay they weren't whiter than white but they literally put so much effort into building those accounts, they will never be classed as yours.

I've been take Omega 3 for quite a while now. Just recently my eye doctor recommended finding an Omega 3 with at least this amount of 800mg EPA and 600mg DHA. I'm taking this for my dry eyes. So far, along with the eye drops and this product my eyes don't feel like I have sand in them. They don't have a fishy taste or an after taste. I would recommend them.
Fatty predatory fish like sharks, swordfish, tilefish, and albacore tuna may be high in omega-3 fatty acids, but due to their position at the top of the food chain, these species may also accumulate toxic substances through biomagnification. For this reason, the United States Environmental Protection Agency recommends limiting consumption (especially for women of childbearing age) of certain (predatory) fish species (e.g. albacore tuna, shark, king mackerel, tilefish and swordfish) due to high levels of the toxic contaminant mercury. Dioxin, PCBs and chlordane are also present.[13] Fish oil is used as a component in aquaculture feed. More than 50 percent of the world's fish oil used in aquaculture feed is fed to farmed salmon.[14]
For several years now, the fish oil and Alzheimer’s disease connection has been studied with consistent results. The essential fatty acids vital for brain function that are found in fish oil can not only slow cognitive decline, but can help prevent brain atrophy in older adults. A study published in the FASEB Journal looked at the health effects of four- to 17-month dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants. The findings once again confirm the potential for fish oil to be used as a weapon to fend off the onset of cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. (8)
Weight loss. Some research shows that eating fish improves weight loss and decreases blood sugar in people who are overweight with high blood pressure. Early research also shows that taking a specific fish oil supplement (Hi-DHA, NuMega) lowers body fat when combined with exercise. But other evidence suggests that taking another specific fish oil supplement (Lovaza) does not lower body weight in overweight people.
Fish or seafood allergy: Some people who are allergic to seafood such as fish might also be allergic to fish oil supplements. There is no reliable information showing how likely people with seafood allergy are to have an allergic reaction to fish oil. Until more is known, advise patients allergic to seafood to avoid or use fish oil supplements cautiously.
My optometrist explained to me how important a good quality fish oil was to my eye health because I have dry eye due to inflammation. Little did I realize that it would be go for so many other things. Since I have been taking this product, not only have I had improvement with my dry eyes, but I have less joint pain from my osteoarthritis! I am so happy I found this and plan to continue it as part of my regular supplement routine! Thanks BioScience Nutrition!
A scientific review published in 2013 looked at omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostate cancer prevention. Researchers concluded that there’s a great deal of evidence suggesting that omega-3s have antiproliferative effects – which means they inhibit cancer cell growth – in cancer cell lines, animal models and humans. In addition, the “direct effects on cancer cells” and indirect anti-inflammatory effects on the immune system fighting the cancer likely contribute to the ability of omega-3 fatty acids to inhibit tumor growth. (14)
High blood pressure. Fish oil seems to slightly lower blood pressure in people with moderate to very high blood pressure. Some types of fish oil might also reduce blood pressure in people with slightly high blood pressure, but results are inconsistent. Fish oil seems to add to the effects of some, but not all, blood pressure-lowering medications. However, it doesn't seem to reduce blood pressure in people with uncontrolled blood pressure who are already taking blood pressure-lowering medications.
A new Cochrane systematic review, published today in the Cochrane Library, combines the results of seventy-nine randomised trials involving 112,059 people. These studies assessed effects of consuming additional omega 3 fat, compared to usual or lower omega 3, on diseases of the heart and circulation. Twenty-five studies were assessed as highly trustworthy because they were well designed and conducted.
Abnormal cholesterol or fat levels in the blood (dyslipidemia). There is conflicting evidence about the effects of fish oil on cholesterol and fat levels in the blood. Some research shows that taking fish oil can lower triglyceride levels, low density lipoprotein (LDL or "bad") cholesterol, and increase high density lipoprotein (HDL or "good") cholesterol in people with abnormal cholesterol levels. However, other research shows that taking fish oil daily does not have this effect.
Here is a brief on omega-3 fatty acids: There are three types of omega-3 fatty acids, namely alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). All three are important for the body. Vegetable sources, including flaxseed oil, soybean oil, hemp oil, canola oil, walnut oil, rapeseed, perilla, chia, and tofu are rich in ALA. The human body has the ability to convert ALA to DHA and EPA, though there are certain limitations to this conversion.
I bought the Nutrigold and they have almost identical EPA DHA fish oil, etc, etc, etc. The main difference is price and the NOW Ultra Omega 3 is a lot less expensive, with the nutrigold going for around $37.00 and NOW going for $ 23.06. I buy Nutrigold almost exclusively but after much investigation and product comparisons there is no discernible difference in the products except NOW is enteric coated. I will stay with NOW to see if the enteric coating makes a difference. ! month of NOW and so far so good. I don't think you will find better Omega 3 products on the market. I take 1 in the morning and 1 at night to get my 500mgs of DHA.
To date, no studies have assessed mortality or nonfatal MI in diabetic patients treated with fish oil.52–54 A recent comprehensive meta-analysis analyzed the effect of fish oil supplements on metabolic parameters when added to usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or impaired glucose tolerance.54 The meta-analysis included a total of 23 small, randomized trials with over 1000 patients that were assessed for lipid and insulin resistance parameters. At a mean follow-up of approximately 9 weeks, triglyceride reduction was accomplished but no significant changes were seen in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, HgA1c levels, fasting glucose levels, fasting insulin, or in body weight. The largest randomized trial to date assessed approximately 400 patients with impaired glucose tolerance or insulin-dependent diabetes mel-litus, and as reflected in the larger meta-analysis, found no effect of moderate to high doses of fish oil on diabetic parameters.55 There are insufficient randomized data to comment on the combination of fish oil and specific diabetes medications and related mortality and/or morbidity.
The omega-3 PUFA EPA and DHA are important throughout life and are a dietary necessity found predominantly in fish and fish-oil supplements. The omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA are essential for proper fetal development, and supplementation during pregnancy has also been linked to decreased immune responses in infants including decreased incidence of allergies in infants. Omega-3 fatty acid consumption has been associated with improved cardiovascular function in terms of antiinflammatory properties, PAD, reduced major coronary events, and improved antiplatelet effects in the face of aspirin resistance or clopidogrel hyporesponsiveness. Patients with AD have been shown to be deficient in DHA, and supplementing them with EPA+DHA not only reverses this deficiency, but may also improve cognitive functioning in patients with very mild AD. With increasing rates of pediatric allergies, cardiovascular disease, and AD in the United States, EPA and DHA may be a safe and inexpensive link to a healthier life. Further research should be conducted in humans to assess a variety of clinical outcomes including quality of life and mental status. In addition, because potent lipid mediator metabolites of EPA and DHA are of great interest currently, their influence on these important outcomes should be assessed because current evidence suggests that their antiinflammatory and tissue-protective effects are nearly 1000 times greater than those of EPA and DHA (7).
Omega-3s are important components of the membranes that surround each cell in your body. DHA levels are especially high in retina (eye), brain, and sperm cells. Omega-3s also provide calories to give your body energy and have many functions in your heart, blood vessels, lungs, immune system, and endocrine system (the network of hormone-producing glands).
If you want to take higher doses of omega-3 fish oil supplements, talk to your doctor first. Your doctor can guide you in supplementing your diet with omega-3 fish oil. Also, your doctor can monitor all aspects of your health if you take higher doses of fish oil.For people with very high triglyceride levels, prescription omega-3 preparations are also available.
The studies recruited men and women, some healthy and others with existing illnesses from North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. Participants were randomly assigned to increase their omega 3 fats or to maintain their usual intake of fat for at least a year. Most studies investigated the impact of giving a long-chain omega 3 supplement in a capsule form and compared it to a dummy pill. Only a few assessed whole fish intake. Most ALA trials added omega 3 fats to foods such as margarine and gave these enriched foods, or naturally ALA-rich foods such as walnuts, to people in the intervention groups, and usual (non-enriched) foods to other participants.
1. Omega-3 benefits your heart health. An Italian study (GISSI)5 of 11,324 heart attack survivors found that patients supplementing with fish oils markedly reduced their risk of another heart attack, stroke, or death. In a separate study, 6 American medical researchers reported that men who consumed fish once or more every week had a 50 percent lower risk of dying from a sudden cardiac event than do men who eat fish less than once a month.

A certain kidney disease called IgA nephropathy. Some research shows that long-term but not short-term use of fish oil can slow the loss of kidney function in high-risk patients with IgA nephropathy. Fish oil might have greater effects when taken at higher doses. Also, it might be most effective in people with IgA nephropathy who have higher levels of protein in the urine.
About the only exception are wild-caught Alaskan salmon and very small fish like sardines. The highest concentrations of mercury are found in large carnivorous fish like tuna, sea bass, and marlin. You may need to be especially cautious of canned tuna as well, as independent testing by the Mercury Policy Project found that the average mercury concentration in canned tuna is far over the "safe limits" of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
Children, in particular, seem to experience problems with sleep when they don’t get enough omega-3 fatty acids in their diets. In adults, low omega-3 levels are associated with obstructive sleep apnea. One reason for this may be that low omega-3s are linked to lower levels of melatonin, the hormone partly responsible for helping you to get to sleep in the first place.
For rheumatoid arthritis, one systematic review found consistent, but modest, evidence for the effect of marine n−3 PUFAs on symptoms such as "joint swelling and pain, duration of morning stiffness, global assessments of pain and disease activity" as well as the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.[35] The American College of Rheumatology has stated that there may be modest benefit from the use of fish oils, but that it may take months for effects to be seen, and cautions for possible gastrointestinal side effects and the possibility of the supplements containing mercury or vitamin A at toxic levels. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health has concluded that "[n]o dietary supplement has shown clear benefits for rheumatoid arthritis", but that there is preliminary evidence that fish oil may be beneficial, but needs further study.[36]
The results of several small studies had suggested that taking omega-3 supplements might help relieve symptoms of dry eye disease. However, a 2018 NIH-sponsored study that tested omega-3 supplements for a full year in a larger group (535 study participants) with moderate-to-severe dry eye disease found that the supplements were no more helpful than a placebo (an inactive substance).
You “beat me to the punch.” despite labels, cured meats , aged fats, as well as those heated to a high enough temperature all have trans bonds. Fish that offer high amounts of Omega-3 also often are high in mercury. I was fortunate to have a very good teacher for experimental design. One should be careful to assume that a study actually measures what it claims to and without “confounders” Confounders are parts of the study that complicate the the “logic” of the design. Also, were other fat contents measured or controlled? It would be reasonable to suspect that those with higher levels of Omega-3 could have higher levels of Omega-6, fats in general , High levels of protein, higher levels of testosterone, or lower levels of certain hormones. In addition, statistical studies do not and have never indicated a causal relationship. I have a fear of how much we have begun to rely on statistical correlational studies which are at the end of the day”soft” science.
Causing unsafe conditions. Fish oil may increase the risk of bleeding, which can lead to an unsafe condition. Excessive bleeding inside the body may also lead to conditions such as ulcers or liver disease which could be quite dangerous. Be aware of the signs and symptoms of this condition such as bruising easily or nosebleeds which could be a sign that you are developing this condition. If you begin to bleed more easily than usual then you should reduce the amount of fish oil you take regularly to reduce this condition.
Preventing re-blockage of blood vessels after angioplasty, a procedure to open a closed blood vessel. Research suggests that fish oil decreases the rate of blood vessel re-blockage by up to 45% when given for at least 3 weeks before an angioplasty and continued for one month thereafter. But, when given for 2 weeks or less before angioplasty, it doesn't seem to have any effect.
During pregnancy and breastfeeding, eating 8 to 12 ounces per week of fish and other seafood may improve your baby’s health. However, it is important to choose fish that are higher in EPA and DHA and lower in mercury. Examples are salmon, herring, sardines, and trout. It is not clear whether taking dietary supplements containing EPA and DHA during pregnancy or breastfeeding affects a baby’s health or development. However, some studies show that taking these supplements may slightly increase a baby’s weight at birth and the length of time the baby is in the womb, both of which may be beneficial. Breast milk contains DHA. Most commercial infant formulas also contain DHA.
I now suspect that those thousands of gel-covered capsules I’ve swallowed over the years may have done little more than enrich the pockets of supplement producers and sellers. A number of extensive analyses have been conducted, some supporting and others refuting the value of fish oils to the cardiovascular system, along with studies of other purported health benefits that also have had mixed results.
This systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials conducted on participants with clinical anxiety symptoms provides the first meta-analytic evidence, to our knowledge, that omega-3 PUFA treatment may be associated with anxiety reduction, which might not only be due to a potential placebo effect, but also from some associations of treatment with reduced anxiety symptoms. The beneficial anxiolytic effects of omega-3 PUFAs might be stronger in participants with specific clinical diagnoses than in those without specific clinical conditions. Larger and well-designed clinical trials should be performed with high-dose omega-3 PUFAs, provided as monotherapy and as adjunctive treatment to standard therapy.

In general, most health organizations agree 250–500 milligrams of EPA and DHA combined each day is a reasonable amount to support healthy individuals. However, people with heart problems (or those with a high risk of heart disease), depression, anxiety and cancer (and possibly more conditions) may benefit from higher doses — up to 4,000 milligrams per day for some heart-related conditions.

I have been a long time user of Fish Oils for their anti-inflammatory action, unfortunately I have not really obtained much benefit in that area, though the benefits of eye health have been very good. I have been thinking of dropping this supplement for a number of reasons, first, I read a while back the possibility of “sudden death” in those that supplement in larger quantities, I use 1-2 tablespoons since I have an autoimmune issue. Now that you have brought forth the information that Fish Oil suppresses CD8+ counts I will definitely do so, reason being CD8+ T cells are very much at the forefront of containing the Epstein Barr virus and this virus has been implicated in most autoimmune issues. I doubt it will make a difference with my AI, but perhaps it will help prevent other issues down the line. Keep up the great work, very informative!
Omega-3 fatty acids are found primarily in fish oil and certain marine algae. Because depression appears less common in nations where people eat large amounts of fish, scientists have investigated whether fish oils may prevent and/or treat depression and other mood disorders. Two omega-3 fatty acids — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — are thought to have the most potential to benefit people with mood disorders.
Many studies documenting the benefits of omega-3s have been conducted with supplemental daily dosages between 2 and 5 grams of EPA and DHA, more than you could get in 2 servings of fish a week. But that doesn't mean eating fish is an exercise in futility. Many studies document its benefits. For example, a 2003 National Eye Institute study showed that 60- to 80-year-olds eating fish more than twice a week were half as likely to develop macular degeneration as those who ate no fish at all.
Omega-3 fats may also impact the development of arthritis. As far back as 1959, studies were published about the effectiveness of cod liver oil on arthritic patients. In the 1959 study, 93 percent of participants “showed major clinical improvement.” (73) While there is no evidence that high omega-3 levels can prevent the development of arthritis, it seems clear that they can reduce inflammation that causes the typical bone and joint pain experienced in the disease. (74)
Warfarin (Coumadin) is used to slow blood clotting. Fish oil also might slow blood clotting. Taking fish oil with warfarin might slow blood clotting too much and increase the risk of bleeding. However, conflicting results suggests that fish oil does not increase the effects of warfarin. Until more is known, use cautiously in combination with warfarin. Have your blood checked regularly, as your dose of warfarin (Coumadin) might need to be changed.
Despite this one study, you should still consider eating fish and other seafood as a healthy strategy. If we could absolutely, positively say that the benefits of eating seafood comes entirely from omega-3 fats, then downing fish oil pills would be an alternative to eating fish. But it’s more than likely that you need the entire orchestra of fish fats, vitamins, minerals, and supporting molecules, rather than the lone notes of EPA and DHA.
The effect of fish oil on incident atrial fibrillation has not been studied in large randomized trials, and observational population-based trials show mixed results. The Danish Diet, Cancer and Health Study, and the Rotterdam Study followed 47,000 and 5100 middle-aged adults, respectively.45,46 Neither study found that the consumption of fish oil affected the incidence of atrial fibrillation. Similar findings were seen in the Women’s Health Initiative where there was no association between fish and omega-3 FA intake regarding incident atrial fibrillation.47 However, in a 12-year prospective, observational study of 4815 adults over the age of 65, daily fish consumption was associated with a 31% risk reduction in incident atrial fibrillation.48
Dry eye. Some clinical research shows that eating more fish oil is linked to a lower risk of getting dry eye syndrome in women. Other research shows that taking a specific fish oil product (PRN Dry Eye Omega Benefits softgels) daily modestly improves symptoms of dry eye such as pain, blurred vision, and sensitivity. Other research using other forms of fish oil products suggests that taking these supplements for 4-12 weeks modest improves some dry eye symptoms. However, the sensation of eye dryness is not always improved. Other research also shows that taking a specific combination products containing fish oil and other ingredients might improve some dry eye symptoms; however, this research is conflicted and poor quality.
Due to the presence of Omega-3 fatty acids, fish oil has been promoted for relieving depression, sadness, anxiety, restlessness, mental fatigue, stress, decreased sexual desire, suicidal tendencies, and other nervous disorders. Researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, in their research publication titled “Fish Oils and Bipolar Disorder: A Promising but Untested Treatment”, state that fish oil can be useful in mood stabilization and the treatment of bipolar disorders. It is unsurprising, therefore, that countries where fish is frequently eaten, have a low incidence of depression. Similarly, research conducted on prisoners has shown that when prisoners were given seafood containing a higher amount of omega-3 fatty acids, there was a significant drop in the homicide rate and the frequency of violence. Intake of fish is also a good remedy for depression. Findings of a research study suggest that fish consumption may be beneficial for women’s mental health and reduces the risk of developing depression in women.
Fish oil is effective in reducing inflammation in the blood and tissues. Regular consumption of fish oil supplements, tablets, pills, and capsules is helpful to those who suffer from chronic inflammatory diseases. Fish oil is effective in treating gastrointestinal disorders, Celiac disease, short bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn’s Disease and ulcerative colitis, which are both typical disorders of the intestine. Patients suffering from Crohn’s disease often find it difficult to absorb vitamins, fats, and essential supplements. Fish oil supplements are an effective diet for such patients.
Fish oils seem to help reduce some fat levels in the blood. These fats are called triglycerides. Birth control pills might decrease the effectiveness of fish oils by reducing these fat levels in the blood.Some birth control pills include ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel (Triphasil), ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone (Ortho-Novum 1/35, Ortho-Novum 7/7/7), and others.
Studies have also found that omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil are associated with improved survival rates for heart attack victims. A study published in the medical journal Circulation found that people who took a high dose of fish oil each for six months following the occurrence of a heart attack actually improved their hearts’ overall functioning and also reduced biomarkers of systemic inflammation. (20)
Human diet has changed rapidly in recent centuries resulting in a reported increased diet of omega−6 in comparison to omega−3.[83] The rapid evolution of human diet away from a 1:1 omega−3 and omega−6 ratio, such as during the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution, has presumably been too fast for humans to have adapted to biological profiles adept at balancing omega−3 and omega−6 ratios of 1:1.[84] This is commonly believed to be the reason why modern diets are correlated with many inflammatory disorders.[83] While omega−3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may be beneficial in preventing heart disease in humans, the level of omega−6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (and, therefore, the ratio) does not matter.[78][85]
The European Journal of Neuroscience published a study in 2013 showing that fish oil reversed all anxiety-like and depression-like behavior changes induced in rats. This is an interesting study because it stresses the importance of supplementing with fish oil at “critical periods of brain development.” (10) This is exactly why I recommend giving fish oil to our kids from early on to help them so they won’t develop anxiety or depression later in life.
Consumers of oily fish should be aware of the potential presence of heavy metals and fat-soluble pollutants like PCBs and dioxins, which are known to accumulate up the food chain. After extensive review, researchers from Harvard's School of Public Health in the Journal of the American Medical Association (2006) reported that the benefits of fish intake generally far outweigh the potential risks.
Pay attention to the quality of fish oil when purchasing it. It is obtained from almost all fishes – fresh water, farm, ocean, deep sea and shallow sea fish. All these fishes can be contaminated with toxic compounds such as mercury, arsenic, lead, forms of calcium, furans, dioxins, PCBs, and methylmercury, and can negatively affect the human body. Therefore, the fish oil used must be pure. Many companies sell ultra refined or distilled fish oil, but you should always check if the standards have been followed and research on the company or the product before adding it to your diet.
Keep in mind that APA found in plant-based foods takes a lot of energy for your body to convert to EPA and DHA. I understand that many people following a vegan diet struggle with the concept of fish oil or eating fish, but animal products contain the necessary omega-3 fatty acids to allow your body to absorb and synthesize what you take in. However, there are plant-based options — you’ll just need more APA because of the way your body processes the medium-chain fatty acid.
A Cochrane meta-analysis published in June 2012 found no significant protective effect for cognitive decline for those aged 60 and over and who started taking fatty acids after this age. A co-author of the study said to Time, "Our analysis suggests that there is currently no evidence that omega-3 fatty acid supplements provide a benefit for memory or concentration in later life".[43]
Meta‐analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all‐cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03, 92,653 participants; 8189 deaths in 39 trials, high‐quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03, 67,772 participants; 4544 CVD deaths in 25 RCTs), cardiovascular events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04, 90,378 participants; 14,737 people experienced events in 38 trials, high‐quality evidence), coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09, 73,491 participants; 1596 CHD deaths in 21 RCTs), stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16, 89,358 participants; 1822 strokes in 28 trials) or arrhythmia (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05, 53,796 participants; 3788 people experienced arrhythmia in 28 RCTs). There was a suggestion that LCn3 reduced CHD events (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97, 84,301 participants; 5469 people experienced CHD events in 28 RCTs); however, this was not maintained in sensitivity analyses – LCn3 probably makes little or no difference to CHD event risk. All evidence was of moderate GRADE quality, except as noted.
Since EPA and DHA are both essential for health and appear together in nature, many studies have attempted to treat clinical conditions with combined EPA and DHA oils, but the outcomes have been varied, contradictory and disappointing. Consequently, researchers have started to investigate the individual actions of EPA and DHA in isolation, in numerous health conditions where an omega-3 deficiency is related to symptoms or known to play a causative role. The emerging evidence shows marked differences between how these two fatty acids affect us – not just at the cellular level but also the body as a whole.
After just seven days, those supplementing with krill had their CRP levels reduced by 19.3%, while in the placebo group, CRP levels rose by 15.7%. Even more impressive, the krill benefit was long-lasting. The krill group’s CRP levels continued to fall by 29.7% at 14 days, and 30.9% at 30 days. More importantly from the patients’ points of view, the krill oil supplement reduced pain scores by 28.9%, reduced stiffness by 20.3%, and reduced functional impairment by 22.8%.

The omega-3 index is also important because it is inversely related to one’s omega-6 to omega-3 ratio — another important measurement (3). A lower omega-6/omega-3 ratio (meaning, you consume a balanced amount of these two fatty acid families) is associated with a reduced risk of many chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune disease, to name a few (4). Of course, most people get far too much omega-6 and too little omega-3, thanks to the plethora of highly processed foods in the Western diet.
Secondary prevention fish oil studies demonstrate a significant reduction in MI. But unfortunately, both the observational and randomized trials were conducted in an era before the widespread use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and therefore, the incremental benefit is still unknown. Nevertheless, in patients receiving antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy in addition to fish oil supplementation (even at doses as high as 4 g per day), no serious adverse complications have been reported.
To reap all the omega-3 benefits, it may be difficult for some people to eat the required amounts of oily fish, particularly with the well-known dangers of farmed fish, which are more readily available to most Americans. That’s why some people consider a high-quality omega-3 supplement in addition to a well-rounded diet. I’ll discuss supplements in a moment, though.
Fish and omega-3 fatty acids. If you keep up with the latest nutrition news, you may have a pretty good sense of what they offer. But, if you're like many people, you still can't tell your omega-3s from your omega-6s -- and you sure as heck can't pronounce eicosapentaenoic acid. That's OK. Our fishing expedition turned up some interesting facts to share about omega-3 fatty acids and fish.

With diesel fuel costs skyrocketing from $4 to $10, transportation companies are looking into the concept of road trains. A road train consists of several trailers hauled by a single truck. This strategy of road transport has been used in Australia, the western United States and Canada for years. This is not a safe practice within cities, heavy traffic or on windy roads and mountain passes. In North America road trains cannot be longer than 100 feet in length and can only travel on roads with at least two lanes on each side of the highway. To create a road train of four or more trailers they would need to travel in lanes specifically dedicated to these trucks.
Many trucking companies have gathered together to express their willingness to help fund such an undertaking in exchange for special taxes or tolls. Many of us are familiar with the new hybrid buses that are taking over many roadways around the world. The idea behind these buses is the ability to utilize both diesel and electric fuel sources for this transportation method. This technology has made it into the automotive industry in the way of gas/electric hybrids and now heavy weights in the diesel automotive world are working on diesel/electric hybrids. International Harvester has already debuted a mid-size diesel-electric truck. It's a short matter of time for semi-tractor trailers to follow suit. For a road train to work safely and effectively, they would need to arrive at their destination at a switching yard, much like a convention train would, and the trailers would need to be separated to contine on their journey. These trailers would be picked up by the local trucks for the merchandise to be delivered properly.
This system would need to be rolled out over a series of steps to ensure the safety and efficiency of the strategies success. As with many major transportation undertakings, this idea was actually utilized when the first railroads were build over a century ago by New Haven, Pennsylvania and New York Central Railroads. The companies spearheading this road train concept are merely referring to those technologies of the first railroads, only without the rails.
Once these trailers are able to make it toward running on electric power current and future drivers will want to utilize the EV and PHEV highway catenaries much more often.

Dr. Michael and JoAnn Fishbein hosted young refugees Agut (left) and Mapach Odolla at their Falmouth home this summer. The siblings immigrated to the US in 2010 after escaping tribal genocide in Ethiopia.
Refugees Agut O. Odolla, 21, and Mapach O. Odolla, 16, spent this summer analyzing dirt samples and serving pie in Woods Hole, but the quiet lives that the siblings led over the past few months stand in stark contrast to the history of violence, struggle and displacement that they have survived.
Dr. Michael J. and JoAnn N. Fishbein hosted the siblings and have hosted members of the Odolla family at their home on Punch Bowl Drive for the past several summers. The couple met the family through their daughter, Emily H. Fishbein, who works for the refugee service that helped the family resettle in Baltimore from a Kenyan refugee camp.
Dr. and Ms. Fishbein said they did not know much about the siblings’ story when they first visited Cape Cod. “Little by little we learn these pieces, just by being with them a lot,” Ms. Fishbein said. “I think as we build a relationship and trust, we hear more.”
In an interview earlier this month, Agut and Mapach sat side by side on a large couch in the Fishbein’s television room to share their story in full.
Agut and Mapach grew up in Western Ethiopia outside of the city of Gambella, which is situated on the Sudanese border.
The Odolla family is part of the Anuak tribe, an ethnic group that considers itself indigenous to the Gambella region but which is now a minority in the area.
Their father was a farmer, and Mapach said that the ground in the tropical region, fed by the Boro River, was so fertile that their father never even had to water their crops.
“That was the day they killed everybody,” Agut said. “In Gambella, it was Saturday around twelve o’clock, and that’s when the killing started.”
That December, under clear blue skies, the Anuak people were massacred in a genocide that killed about 424 people over the course of three days, according to the Human Rights Watch. Agut and Mapach said that the Ethiopian government and military, largely controlled by the powerful Nuer Tribe, carried out the attacks on their tribe.
Some were killed in their homes. “If you would hide your husband, they would beat you until you told,” Agut said. “If they find the person they would just kill him in front of you, and leave you with the kids, or someone there would just rape you.”
The Odolla family was spared from the initial violence of that day because their farm was located outside of the city. First word of the massacre came from friends and family members who had fled to take refuge at the family farm. The children’s father, who had been shopping in the city that day, did not return, and the family had no way of knowing whether he had escaped or been killed.
It wasn’t more than a few days before the Odolla children had to flee into the jungle as well, hoping their father was alive somewhere else.
Since then, thousands of Anuak people have fled Ethiopia, and ethnic tensions and violence continue.
“I guess it’s still happening today but no one will really talk about it,” Agut said. “One reason would be we are the minority. And, um, a lot of people are not really educated about it. And I think we don’t really have voice.”
Two years later, Agut, Mapach, their mother and five siblings were reunited with their father in a Kenyan refugee camp in Dadaab, where he had prepared a home for them.
Dadaab is a complex of five refugee camps, the largest in the world; according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Dadaab currently holds more than 338,000 registered refugees, which is more refugees than currently live in the United States. If Dadaab were considered a city, it would be the fourth largest in Kenya.
In fact, the camp functions like an independent city in many ways. The UN gives building materials to refugees upon arrival at the camp, but the families are left to create their own shelter. Every 15 days the UN would provide their family with food, water, and firewood to cook with, but Agut said the rations were barely enough to keep them alive. As a result, the camp is a ramshackle of small businesses, as families try to supplement their limited resources; Agut and Mapach’s family made and sold a popular Ethiopian flatbread called injera.
Mapach was about six years old when his family first reached the refugee camp, and he remembers the lifestyle fondly.“Living there was fun,” Mapach said. He is an avid soccer player, and he developed most of his skills during his stay in Dadaab.
“Almost every boy plays soccer because if you don’t play, what do you do?” Mapach said. “There’s nothing else to do, except go to school and then go to soccer afterwards.”
Although the children were able to attend school while living in the refugee camp, Agut said the quality of their English lessons was poor.
“The problem was that the teachers were not really qualified to be teaching because they were just high school students who had just graduated” from the Dadaab schools, Agut said. The extent of their English learning was memorization of the ABC’s, their names, and a few other key words.
Although some refugees in Dadaab will spend their entire lives in the camp, the Odolla family was selected to leave after just a four-year stay. But even after being identified as candidates for resettlement, the interview process with the UN took two full years.
The UN selects and approves only those families who have the highest need for resettlement, evaluating how dangerous it would be for a family to return to their home country and the quality of life for them in Kenya. Less than one percent of the 14.4 million refugees across the globe are submitted to be resettled.
UN officials conduct a series of interviews with all of the family members, even the young children, to verify that their stories match up. Even the slightest deviation could mean rejection of the family’s application.
Dr. Fishbein said many people do not understand the in-depth nature of the refugee resettlement process when they talk about refugees, especially in current political debates about immigration.
“It’s really unfair because it’s probably the most vetted group that comes here,” Dr. Fishbein said.
After two years of interviews and waiting, in 2010 the Odolla family received notice that they would be relocated in the United States.
The International Refugee Committee (IRC), a nonprofit organization founded by Albert Einstein during World War II, provided a home and food for the family upon their arrival in Baltimore and helped them settle into their new home.
Ms. Emily Fishbein works for the IRC, and she was integral in helping the Odolla children integrate into local public schools through the Refugee Youth Project.
Despite not being able to speak English, the children began taking classes as soon as they arrived in the city. Agut and Mapach took full-immersion English as a Second Language (ESL) courses with other refugees and immigrants, and although they picked up English quickly, Agut and Mapach said their first year was a difficult adjustment.
The children were bullied because of their skin color, a concept that Agut said was completely foreign to them. She remembers boys following her to class, taunting her for being “too black” and “ugly.”
“I cried most of the time when people talked about my skin color because it hurts so much,” she said in a written speech. During those early years, Agut spent hours in her room crying after school.
“They come here after enduring a lot obviously, and they had this hope that things will be better, and it is in a lot of ways,” Dr. Fishbein said. However, he said that isolation was a major issue for the children and their parents, who were the only Anuak family in the city.
The transition was particularly difficult for Agut, who had been educated to a 5th grade level while in the Kenyan refugee camp, but was forced to skip middle school in the US because of her age at 16 years old.
“When I got here they told me I was old enough to go to high school and I was like, ‘But I don’t speak English so how is this going to work?’” Agut said. Twice a week Agut attended an optional after school tutoring program with nearby college students, where she learned to read and write.
Despite the fact that she did not speak English when she first enrolled at the school as a freshman, Agut graduated as valedictorian of her graduating class in 2014, and her explanation of her success reads as a bit of an understatement.
“I realized that people talk about others in order to make themselves feel better…They are the ones who are unaware about the vast world out there, the differences other people embody and the many cultures of this world. Once you learn to respect other cultures and embrace difference, you can truly work well with others and create change.”
After graduating as valedictorian, Agut received a full-ride scholarship to McDaniel College in Maryland, where she will be a junior this fall. Agut studies political science and international relations. She hopes to go to law school and eventually work with the UN or for an NGO that protects human rights.
Mapach will enter into his sophomore year in high school this fall, and he hopes to play soccer for a Division 1 university after he graduates. Practiced from his days in the refugee camp, Mapach has played on his school’s varsity soccer team since freshman year.
Mapach and Agut have been working full time in Falmouth this summer, Mapach at Pie in the Sky and Agut at the US Geological Survey in Woods Hole. When asked how people in Falmouth have reacted to hearing their story, Agut and Mapach said most people do not know it very well.
“I don’t really tell people my story if they don’t ask,” Agut said. “If you don’t ask, then maybe you don’t wanna know.”
On weekends, the siblings spend time exploring Cape Cod with Dr. and Ms. Fishbein, sailing, fishing, and taking bike rides.”People in Falmouth are really nice,” Mapach said.
Agut and Mapach left Cape Cod on Monday, August 15, to return to Baltimore, and Dr. and Ms. Fishbein said they will miss their young energy and helpful spirit.
“It’s given me a better appreciation about how comfortable my life is and how fragile life is for so many people around the world,” Ms. Fishbein said.
Dr. and Ms. Fishbein have lived in Falmouth on and off since 1983. Ms. Fishbein is a social worker for Hope Hospice on Martha’s Vineyard, and Dr. Fishbein is a radiologist with Cape Cod Health Care.

The Atari scene has always been rather mysterious to the scenes on other computer systems. Most PC sceners nowadays, unless they have directly started with PC, come from Amiga or the C64. The number of ex-Atarians in the PC scene is minute. Wide connections exist between the Amiga and the PC scene; most of the best graphicians and musicians are or were active on both systems. Amiga and PC sceners regularly meet at scene parties like The Party or Mekka & Symposium, which are dedicated to both systems. The Atari scene, by contrast, seems to be pretty isolated. Atari compos are not held at the large parties of the PC/Amiga scene; instead, the Atari sceners have their own parties. Through this isolation, the Atari scene has kept some special habits: For instance, demo makers are often also game makers. Also the cracking scene, led by the groups Vectronix and Elite, seems to be still active and connected with the demo scene, unlike the PC, where the warez and the demo scenes are completely unrelated nowadays.
Lately it has become a lot easier for PC sceners to explore the Atari scene. Emulators allow to run Atari programs on MS-DOS based systems, and it works pretty well. In this way we can dive into the secrets and mysteries of the Atari scene by watching its productions and reading diskmags, and can re-establish contact between the two scenes.
Actually what we call the Atari scene is mainly split to two computer systems: the old Atari ST and the modern Atari Falcon. Still the Atarians regard themselves as one scene, although individual groups may focus on individual systems.
Unfortunately, at the moment we can only emulate ST computers on the PC using the free emulator PaCifiST by Frederic Gidouin, but that does not matter so much because the diskmags work on both computer systems. The latest version is 0.49beta, and it's available at http://www.pacifist.fatal-design.com. You also need a TOS image, which can be downloaded at http://ldg.fatal-design.com. You will find a guide how to install it there as well.
The most recent scene productions, including diskmags, are available at the excellent homepage of the Dead Hackers Society, which is located at http://dhs.atari.org. All issues of Maggie, one of the oldest disk magazines that is still active, can be also found at the Reservoir Gods' homepage at http://rg.atari.org; the current issue is #26 (August 1998).
Apart from Maggie, the only international diskmag of significance is Undercover Magascene (UCM). It was originally a German magazine, but it switched its language to English some issues ago and quickly found worldwide supporters. The latest issue is #14 from January 1999. Most other diskmags, such as the French Toxic Magazine and several Polish diskmags, are of local range.
If you are interested in learning more about the history of the Atari Scene, read N.r.t.h.'s article The old Atari (Demo)Scene in this Hugi issue. Here, I want to introduce you to the latest issues of Maggie and UCM so that you get a little picture of the Atari diskmags.
This magazine is distributed in two versions, an ST version and a Falcon version. The Falcon version is said to have a very innovative and sophisticated interface. I could not prove that, of course. The ST interface, by contrast, has basically stayed the same for a couple of years. It was lately redesigned by Tat/Avena, one of the leading coders in the Atari scene, though.
You can see a screenshot of the main screen on the right. Using the mouse, you can click on the individual buttons, which causes a window with the article list to pop up in the center of the screen. Often more than one section 'hides' behind a button, so you have to try out all buttons if you search for a certain section unless its name is equal with a button. Hence it does not allow such a clear view as the Undercover main menu.
Having selected an article, you get to the text viewer, which, albeit looking simple and sterile, is useful. The main part of the screen is occupied by the text window, which also features bold, italic, underlined and dark fonts, which however are not so well readable because of the low resolution. Nice feature: A window in the top left screen corner indicates the number of pages and the length of an article in bytes. Besides, there are buttons for scrolling, saving the texts to files and displaying a related graphic (one per article), if existant. You can also change the colours of the text viewer, which does not make it look nicer though. Music is missing in this ST interface, too, except a tiny sound effect after starting the mag.
In this issue, the Maggie staff has slightly changed: MrPink of the Reservoir Gods has become the new deputy editor. Despite that, CiH (Chris Holland) is still in charge of the mag. MrPink starts his main-editing career with a long editorial about the current development of the Atari scene and future predictions. It is written in a clear, humourous, good English, just like the whole mag. No wonder - its makers come from Great Britain.
In general, Maggie has, compared to other Atari disk magazines, a slightly 'upperground' feeling. That mainly comes from the fact that parts of the articles are devoted to non-demoscene topics, such as computer games, stories, music, and satire. The bright, joyful graphics with the big-headed persons contributes to this impression, too. We also find many realnames in the mag - obviously non-sceners. Therefore we can assume that unlike UCM, Maggie is not only a scene mag, but made for all people who are still true to their Ataris.
While being humorous most of the time, the magazine seldomly trespasses the borders to childishness. In my opinion this is an indication of a high journalistic level.
In total this issue contains slightly less than 100 articles, making up 1.1 mbyte of text. After "The Usual" (stuff) - editorial, contact info etc. -, the section "Newsdesk" follows. It starts with miscellaneous scene news, called "Rumours and Lies". Unlike other mags this newssection is not sorted by groups, but mainly by the relevance of the news. Neither are the news written in the common brief style of news sections, but they are written in the style of articles, including the hidden jokes that are typical of Maggie. Hence it is no wonder that the news column has a size of 30 kbyte. Besides, "Newsdesk" contains some party results, information about Atari.ORG and a column by CiH called "Dirk", containing miscellaneous news about topics like the soccer world-cup. Next come a few letters by readers; then the content of the button "Editorial" in the main menu is finished.
Clicking on the button "Demos" reveals some in-depth reviews of party releases, mainly written by MrPink and CiH, and two articles dealing with non-party releases, namely a GEM Demo and several 128-bytetros. Funny fact: with two exceptions, all 128-bytetros are from Reservoir Gods, the group which is on closest terms with Maggie. Yet they are judged fair.
"Various" leads us first to the "Maggie Mega Charts", heavily commented charts with many different, sometimes weird sections ("best diskmag shells", "biggest IRC addicts"). This charts section is a real bomb; all entries that have been voted for are listed, with no exception, and at the end a "Super League" Table comes, in which all points all mentioned groups got have been added together. When the reader has finished making his way to this huge charts section, which makes up almost 100 kbyte, he will be a little disappointed, though: There were only 45 voters. But I guess that is very much in this small scene.
Miscellaneous articles follow, about topics like Arcade emulation, Five years of Falcon scene, and the story of how Toodeloo/DHS was bitten by a snake and cured. Finally there are some "Programming" articles about MIDI programming, the DSP M-registers, splines, and a tracking tutorial (how is that related to programming?!).
"Utilities" contains reviews of utilities, such as alternative desktops, as well as some "Adverts". The "Games" button is not much of a surprise either: It leads to game reviews, both native Atari ST/Falcon games as well as console games, i.e. Gameboy/NES games that can be played on the Falcon using Reservoir Gods' emulators and games for the Atari game-console Jaguar.
A 'highlight' of the magazine is the large Humour part. There are 15 joke articles in total, among them very entertaining, caustic satires of the Dead Hacker Society's news-page and the Undercover Magascene ("UCM job offer"). The latter one is especially amusing when being read after the other definate highlight of Maggie #26: a review of Undercover #12 with a lenght of 80 kbyte. MrPink describes every detail of the zine and presents his opinion of every single article in the mag. He even concludes the mag review by reviewing and rating the individual authors of UCM #12. Wow! That is a masterpiece of a review. However, after reading it, you actually get quite a negative impression of Undercover #12. MrPink critizises many points, such as the bad graphics and the editors' lack of enthusiasm for the scene and writing, which can be seen in reviews with a long header and an actual text length of 3-5 lines and the heavy usage of many four-letter words and phrases like "can't be bothered" or "don't know".
That is why this review has not got down well with all readers. Some people, like new UCM co-editor pAranoid, accuse Maggie of taking advantage of its quality and position in the Atari scene in order to butcher its main opponent UCM, and therefore they think it would have been better not to publish this article. Indeed a kind of war between the two mags has preceeded the writing of that review. But as Undercover #12 already contained lots of attacks against Maggie, I think the review in Maggie is justified, especially as it is reasonably-based in contrast to UCM's emotional attacks. From a journalistic view, this is the hardly attainable prototype of what a diskmag review should look like.
Furthermore, Maggie #26 contains some other (way shorter) diskmag reviews, a film review, some music reviews, the story of Reservoir Gods' upcoming game Republic, interviews with Kevin Callahan and Draco, articles about the Internet, and a last highlight - the Alternative Party Report, again with a length of more than 100 kbyte! It was written by CiH, partly live, partly after the party. Phew!
Indeed it seems as if the Maggie editors love writing long texts. Well, what editor does not love it? However, in Maggie the articles get sometimes even too long. The news section, for instance, would make more sense if it were written in a briefer style. Sometimes the texts are also too funny for my taste, and funny articles are mixed with serious ones in one section. I would separate them more. Some details here and there do not correspond to my notions either. For instance I do not like CiH's extensive use of ending sentences with ".."; it gives a slightly sad touch to the atmosphere, which simply does not fit Maggie's general style. If I were an editor of Maggie, I would also concentrate more on miscellaneous articles instead of reviews. The discussion forum articles which dominate PC diskmags like Imphobia hardly exist in Maggie at all. But objectively judged, Maggie is a good magazine; it's certainly not only one of the leading Atari diskmags but also one of the best active scene mags globally.
This zine is Maggie's direct opponent as it claims to be the leading magazine of the Atari scene. While Maggie has the already mentioned upperground feeling to it, UCM is truely underground; it entirely deals with the demo scene, apart from a few game reviews, a music and a 'hardcore' corner (erotic stories).
The mag is shaped by its main editor Moondog, who advocates a kind of Atari 'patriotism'. He is strongly opposed to people who leave the scene or move to other computer systems, such as the PC. Slogans like "UCM - the voice of Ataririsistance" and "No retreat and no surrender" underline his attitude.
He also shows a very critical, pessimistic attitude towards today's Atari scene and its new trends, like the increasing number of fakedemos, and keeps comparing it with the "good old days", when the German scene was still bigger and dominated the Atari platform. These views were especially expressed in Undercover #12 (the issue that was reviewed in Maggie #26); due to a large number of negative feedback, Moondog slightly retrained himself in UCM #13, trying to show that he still has some enthusiasm, but fell back to flaming and destructive criticism in his reviews in Undercover #14.
Interestingly, he has given up some of his old prejudices at the same time: As Moondog writes in his editorial, he has lately bought a PC in order to surf on the Internet and play games. In this way he really discovered how important the Internet is for the Atari scene, by checking hundreds of group-webpages during a few days. But when he logged on IRC the first time, his euphoria even increased: "With the time I checked that the real interesting stuff is going on in the IRC... yep! That's the so called scene life! I met a lot of people in this time and this is much more addictive than just surfing around!"
It seems as if Moondog has finally realized the advantages of the Internet. A little late for the editor of the 'best' Atari diskmag, eh?
But let's start from the beginning... In contrast to Maggie, only one version of UCM exists, namely the ST version. While older issues partly had nasty bugs, the interface works almost perfectly on PaCifiST since UCM #12. The only little obstacle is that the intro of UCM #13 does not run, but renaming SHELL.BIN in DOS to SHELL.PRG and starting it helps. UCM only crashes sometimes when you move the mouse too fast. Therefore it's better mainly to navigate by keyboard and use the mouse only when needed.
The quality of graphic, especially the main menu background, has also vastly improved since the previous issues. You can see a screenshot of the title screen on the top left. After pressing the space key, you get to the main menu (right). It resembles traditional Amiga and PC magazines very much; you can smoothly scroll upwards and dowards by using the buttons or the cursor keys. Clicking on a headline takes you to the article. In contrast to Maggie, graphics are directly embedded in the articles, the text is in various colours, and there are several fully-working background music tunes.
A peculiarity of Undercover's writing style is the extensive use of poems or song-lyrics in front of the actual articles. Apparently they are supposed to help create the right atmosphere. Usually articles also end with short English or German slogans, such as Moondog's infamous "no retreat and no surrender", "forward ever - backward never", or "affen sind die, die davon tr�umen, ein mensch zu sein" ("monkeys are those who dream of being human"). As the makers of UCM are not native English speakers, the level of English grammar is not as high as in Maggie. In spite of that, the articles are well readable, although Moondog's steadily repeating basic mistakes such as "don't had" instead of "didn't have" is quite embarrassing.
But Moondog is not the only editor of UCM; the mag also has some good writers, such as 505/Checkpoint or the pAranoid/Paranoia. Other members of the regular writers posse are the newsmaster MC Laser, Earx/FUN (the coder of the interface), and UCM's Polish correspondent Grey of Mystic Bytes. Besides, Mad Butscher and Requiem contributed to this issue with articles. In former days also m.O.d/.tSCc. belonged to the staff. Not only is he the best Atari graphician at the moment, but he also was a good writer. However, because of unknown reasons he decided to stop writing for UCM after issue 12.
This Undercover issue is overshadowed by a very sad event: Tommy/Avena, one of the best Atari musicians, has committed suicide. Moondog comments in his editorial, after a song-text that is related to that topic ("Eternity" by Syntec): "I think it's time to look forward, we have lost TOMMY, but we still have his musix, and besides the thoughts to the dead, we shouldn't forget the living ones! [...] Ok, it's another thing if a young guy loses his life, but anyway, we shouldn't fall into deepest mourning because it doesn't help us." I find this a little callous, because it awakens the impression that Moondog just cares about Tommy's music and not him as a person. For me, it is the most depressing thing in the world if a young human being, especially if I know him or her personally, loses his life. A little bright spot: MC Laser has also dedicated an article to Tommy, in which he writes down his thoughts about the tragic suicide and some short interviews with Tommy's group-mates from Avena.
In total, this issue of Undercover Magascene contains about 630 kbyte of articles, which is slightly less than in the previous issues. An interesting text named "The internal UCM writers charts" shows how many articles and kbyte each of the writers has actually written. That is a very nice feature, although it would be hard to count in mags which have more contributors than UCM.
Besides editorial and writers charts, the "Regular" section contains the usual stuff, such as credits, greetings, contacting info, feedback and a preview of the next issue. Next follows the "Scene" section. The "News and Rumours" have a size of 28 kbyte in total, but as they are in a rather brief style, they contain more information than the Maggie "Rumours and Lies" corner. The actual scene section starts with party stuff, to be precise party invitations of Error in Line 99 (German and English versions) and IMParty 8000, furthermore party reports of Unity'98 and Milliways II plus a "realtime article" written at the Milliways II party. Those realtime articles are typical of UCM. If a UCM staff member visits a party, he usually installs a computer somewhere at the party place in which a text editing program is constantly running. Everyone who happens to bump into that machine can write something in the file. These realtime articles usually turn out to be very long but do not have very reasonable contents: in addition to that, people often write in other languages than English. This particular realtime article is a little exception because it is only 12 kbyte.
The next two articles are reports about the Polish and the German scene. Medium size. We learn what happened within the individual groups in the year 1998. The conclusions are quite pessimistic: The Polish scene does not seem to be growing any more, and the core of the German scene consists of no more than 20 people. These articles are followed by Atari Scene Email and Homepage Lists plus new information about Atari.Org.
Furthermore, there are several interviews, based on standard questions such as "Tell us about your life" and "What is your current equipment?" with a little number of personal questions. UCM's scene section also contains Vectronix Newsletter #21 (published by the cracking group with the same name), the FUN News (another newsletter, but about the group FUN), an extensive overhaul of 505's Atari Tracker Scene Report, the first edition of which was published in UCM #12, plus some reviews of tracked music by the same author, an announcement about the ST+ Fanzine, and a review of the highs and lows of 1998.
In "Is there a reason to quit the scene?!", which has the meaningful internal filename "LAMERTAT.TXT" (as you can see after pressing the save button in the main menu and viewing the file in a text editor), Moondog rambles about TAT/Avena, one of the top coders on Atari, who has recently left the scene. This article fully corresponds to his attitude: Moondog is very upset because he think TAT's leaving will also cause other people to leave the scene, such as m.O.d, one of Moondog's best friends, and that will be an even bigger loss for him. The angry main editor calls "TittenTAT" a lamer. He cannot understand at all why one should ever leave the scene, because even the fact that his own father died did not disturb him emotionally so much that he would have left the scene. In this tone, the article goes on for 8 kbyte.
I have some serious fears that Moondog himself might end in a catastrophe. Sooner or later the Atari scene will vanish or at least become so small that you will not be able to speak of it as a scene any more. What will Moondog, who has always sworn to stay in the scene till the very end, do then?
Finally, pAranoid writes almost 16 kbyte about his personal history of computing with Ataris and why he likes Atari computers more than PCs in "10 Years having an Atari". This is a very nicely written article, typical of pAranoid's texts; it stands out against Moondog's articles in a positive way. Probably this is the best essay in UCM #14.
Now after the "Scene" section, we get to the "Demo" corner. This one contains reviews of the latest Falcon and ST demos, intros, chip-tune packs, diskmags, etc. - in total 21 articles. Fortunately the length has improved since UCM #12; the reviews do not just consist of a few lines but usually at least two pages. The reviewed diskmags are the French Toxic Magazine #16 and the Czech Narsil #28.
Next come reviews of Falcon, ST and emulated games, 10 texts in total, followed by the "Mixer" section, including the review of a hardware accelerator for Falcon, world news about computers and "Mad Butscher's Mixer", which contains two game reviews and a report of an Atari user meeting.
All in all Undercover is also quite a nice magazine with a special underground feeling to it. Compared to Maggie, the style is totally different. This shows that the Atari scene, though being small, is not homogenous at all.
What Maggie and UCM have in common is for one thing the large number of demo, diskmag, game, and music reviews, and for another the low presence of discussion articles like we are accustomed to them in PC magazines. It is always interesting to see diskmags on other computer platforms and compare them with the ones we are used to. Sometimes they may contain interesting ideas that are useful for our diskmags, too. And it can be fun to explore a new, unknown scene, with an unoverseeable affinity with ours, but breathing and developing mostly independent of us.

As judging for the 2014 competition nears completion, we want to give a thank-you to one of Filmfest’s long-standing and extraordinarily talented judges, Neil Curry of South Africa.
Neil had been busy making a documentary about a new Biosphere Reserve established in the Klein Karoo area of South Africa, where he lives. The Reserve was set up primarily to promote the conservation of the unique vegetation and the animals of the area while, at the same time, protecting and restoring the water catchments that have been damaged. Neil donated the film to the Reserve to help promote its message to farmers and landowners, as well as to municipalities and school groups, to encourage them to participate in the initiative. Check out another popular work by Neil Curry: http://documentarystorm.com/the-elephant-the-emperor-and-the-butterfly-tree/

Let's talk about magic. Because music, at its best, is a kind of magic that lifts you up and take you somewhere else. "I want my music to sound like throwing yourself out of a tree, or off a tall building, or as if you're being sucked down into the ocean and you can't breathe," says Florence Welch. "It's something overwhelming and all-encompassing that fills you up, and you're either going to explode with it, or you're just going to disappear."
Her debut album Lungs was released in 2009 and was at the number 2 position for its first five weeks in the UK chart. The debut single was "Kiss with a Fist". The song was used in the soundtrack of the film Jennifer's Body.
The next single was "Dog Days are Over" followed by "Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)" and "Drumming Song". Recently Florence and the Machine filmed a video for her cover of Candi Staton's "You Got The Love" on release in Ireland on November 20th.

Saquon Barkley, the All-America running back from Penn State selected second overall in the draft by the Giants, is the leader according to DICK’S Sporting Goods Jersey Report .
Barkley is one of two rookies in the top 10; top overall pick Baker Mayfield, Cleveland’s quarterback, is ranked ninth.
Along with Barkley and Mayfield, popular rookie jerseys belong to Buffalo QB Josh Allen, followed by Denver DE Bradley Chubb and Cleveland DB Denzel Ward.
Joining Miller on the defensive list are Carolina LB Luke Kuechly, Houston DE J.J. Watt, Cleveland DE Myles Garrett, and Chubb.
The NFC East dominates sales on the Jersey Report with the top three teams: the Giants, Eagles and Cowboys Germain Ifedi Jersey , New England is fourth, Denver fifth.
San Francisco is the least-popular club, though if Jimmy Garoppolo and remain unbeaten as a starting quarterback, who knows if that will last.
The story of the Philadelphia Eagles‘ first NFL championship since 1960 has been told in many ways and with many angles.
None has been as refreshing or unique as the theme taken by AP Football Writer Rob Maaddi in his new book, “Birds of Pray.”
With a foreword by Carson Wentz , Maaddi examines how the strong faith and religious devotion in the Eagles’ locker room helped drive them to the highest achievement in pro football. Maaddi, who has covered Philadelphia sports since 2000, not only interviews dozens of players and their families, he chronicles the ups and downs of the team’s title season with a pinpoint focus on the power that belief — whether it be in God or each other — can bring.
“The real story of the Super Bowl champions can’t be told without talking about the strong faith and the unique bond many of the players shared,” Maaddi says. “I’ve never seen a team that was more united than the 2017 Philadelphia Eagles, and their faith is what created that special brotherhood, and their faith is what allowed them to persevere and overcome so much adversity and ultimately become champions.”
The Dallas Cowboys are the NFL’s No. 1 team, while the Jacksonville Jaguars and San Francisco 49ers are coming on strong?
For the fifth straight year Vernon Hargreaves III Jersey , demand for Cowboys tickets is the highest in the league. StubHub sees an increase of nearly 300 percent in sales over the average when the Cowboys are the visiting team.
“The Cowboys are an iconic franchise with a reputation that continues to draw a crowd season after season,” says Scott Jablonski, StubHub’s general manager of NFL, NBA & NHL.
But a Cowboys contest is not the most-sought ticket heading into the season. That game actually is in London, where the Jaguars host the Eagles on Oct. 28. It’s the first time an international series game has appeared in StubHub’s top 10 most in-demand games.
“Eagles fans have always been passionate, but their Super Bowl win has truly ignited the fan base to unprecedented levels,” says Jablonski. “We’re seeing Eagles fans willing to travel long distances to watch their team play, including internationally for their game in London.”
The Jaguars and 49ers have seen large demand growth compared to last season; San Francisco has moved up from 19th to sixth, while sales for Jacksonville games are up 318 percent following the team’s run to the AFC title game last January.
Like many — probably most — athletes, Josh Rosen is impressed by the career and stature of LeBron James. The rookie quarterback of the Arizona Cardinals, who has drawn criticism from some for being arrogant because of his frankness and willingness to take a stand, has strong praise for the latest venture of the NBA’s biggest star.
Asked by Adam Schein on his SiriusXM satellite radio program how Rosen sometimes has been perceived, the 10th overall selection in this year’s draft noted: “I think it is always about crafting the message. There is always a good intention at heart; anything I do or say in putting myself out there is for the sake of helping others and trying to give people a voice who don’t actually have one.
“And on that topic, LeBron’s new show John Hannah Jersey , ‘The Shop,’ it is exactly what this country means when they talk about ‘We need to have a conversation.’ And people are like, ‘What does that even mean, it’s conceptualist.’
“This show and that concept of athletes taking a lead and taking a role of sort of progress is really admirable, and that is exactly what we all should be rooting for, not criticizing.”
The initial, albeit technically erroneous, reports regarding Odell Beckham‘s new contract pegged the deal at $95 million over five years, giving the deal an average value of $19 million. But that’s not what the deal is worth.
Yes, the new-money average of the base deal sits at $18 million per year (five years, $90-not-95 million). And that puts him north of Steelers receiver Antonio Brown‘s new-money average of $17 million annually.
But Camp Beckham eschewed the new-money analysis when arguing that the Giants had offered Beckham less than the $16 million per year obtained on the open market by Chiefs receiver Sammy Watkins, the highest paid player at the position for deals analyzed from the moment of signing. As to Beckham, who already was due to make $8.459 million in 2018, he didn’t sign a five-year Michael Crabtree Jersey , $90 million deal that gets stapled onto the back of his current contract but a new deal that covers six years and has a base value of $98.459 million.
That’s an average from the moment signing of $16.4 million per year. And it makes him the highest paid receiver, by $400,000 per year. And that’s hardly the kind of bump over the prior high-water mark that a supposedly “transcendent” player should have gotten.
So why did Beckham take that instead of $20 million per year or more at signing? Because Beckham wisely realized that the bird in the hand had grown more than fat enough to justify not waiting for the proverbial two in the bush. With the Giants reportedly guaranteeing $41 million at signing and providing an injury guarantee of $65 million, it would have been foolish for Beckham to say no.
Ultimately, that’s how to get these deals done, from the team’s perspective. What the player wants is roughly as relevant as Spaulding’s laundry list of desire foodstuffs before starting the back nine at Bushwood. What the player will or won’t refuse is what really matters. Beckham wouldn’t, and couldn’t, refuse the offer that the Giants made, even if it only (only?) pays him $16.4 million per year over six years, committing him to the team until he’s on the brink of 32.

I am a Southern boy, born and bred in the land of sweet tea, grits, and high humidity. My drawl may be slow and drawn out, but I too speak the King’s English just like they do in Boston, but without the extra “r” in words that have no “r’s,” or in sunny California, but choosing “y’all” over “you guys” every time. My “i’s” are long, and sometimes, depending on what part of the country I’m visiting, I have to spell the word “ice” instead of asking for it so the waitress knows I’m talking about frozen water instead of a posterior body part. I refer to all soft drinks as Coke’s instead of pop, but I prefer a Diet Dew.
I am proud of where I come from. I have never once in my life been ashamed of my birthplace. As my wife’s grandfather used to say, “It’s the best place in the world.” I know there are folks who think I should be, but I’m not! On the other hand, from time to time, I have found myself ashamed of some of the things my neighbors have said or done down through history. But, let’s be honest, stupid people are spread thick like peanut butter across every nook and cranny of this whole wide world. Every generation, nation, culture, or people group has its own share of stupid people. As Forrest Gump says, “Stupid is as stupid does.” But stupid is an individual trait that is sometimes catching, like a bad case of diarrhea. Perhaps I shouldn’t use the word “stupid,” (or for that matter diarrhea). My granddaughter tells me it’s a bad word according to her mother, who stares at me every time I say it with an icy glare that could freeze antifreeze, but it does communicate my point.
My ancestors were immigrants just like yours were if you live in this country. They came from somewhere else—looking for an opportunity to make a living, build a family, follow a dream and worship God freely. My people were soldiers, sharecroppers, peddlers, and coal miners who worked long days for little or no money. They were honorable men and women, doing what it took to survive and thrive in a land filled with opportunity. They were not perfect. They did not do everything right. But—they were just people—so where yours.
I am an American. I still get a lump in my throat when I see the flag or hear the swell of the notes as the national anthem is played. I don’t determine my value based on my ethnicity, color, or country of ancestral origin. And neither do I determine the value of anyone else that way. I don’t refer to myself as Scottish-American, African-American, Arab-American, Italian-American, Jewish-American, or any other of the million and one places you can leave and make your destination America. The “where” my ancestors came from does not determine who I am or who I will be. Take away my skin and my blood is red just like yours. Cut me and I bleed just like you do. Call me a name or shoot me the finger and I want to punch you just like you would if you were on the receiving end.
Regardless of where you come from, what you call yourself, or what you believe, we are all connected—by origin and by destiny. All of us are the descendants of one single couple. God didn’t create a community on a cul-de-sac with all the colors of the rainbow. He simply created one couple and conveniently left out the explanation of their color, ethnicity, and national origin. In other words, your guess is as good as mine. It is after all, a guess. So why waste any more time postulating and prognosticating about it. We are, after all kin—brothers of different mothers and sisters of different misters.
You may not like our president or the congress, but I’ve lived long enough to realize that is the case with most presidents and most congresses. You may not like my politics and I may not like yours. But we—not you alone or me alone—are Americans. Our destiny—not yours alone or mine alone—is bound up in to our unity of purpose and our mutual respect for one another. I may not agree with you and you may not agree with me, but we desperately need each other—if for no other reason than to maintain the unique diversity of this great country. This nation was founded by a coalition of folks who came from different places and different beliefs with little in common and countless things they disagreed on except they were tired of being told what to do by an absentee king whose only interest was their tax money. In fact, the only thing they had in common was an insatiable desire to be free.
Freedom necessitates diversity. It requires all the cultures of the North, the West, the East, and yes, a whiff of the South thrown in for spice and good measure. It demands a multiplicity of races, beliefs, and politics who disagree, but find a compromise that works for all of the people most of the time rather than a few of the people all of the time. Freedom that works for only a handful is not really freedom at all. It is slavery dressed up in a cheap Halloween costume.
I celebrate my Southern culture and upbringing. I revel in the beauty and the majesty of the state in which I was born. I take joy and pride from where my people originally hail from. I feel comfortable speaking the King’s English in my own regional dialect. And I could live off grits, gravy, fried chicken, collards, and buttermilk biscuits. But I can’t be an American without you. You see, I don’t make America—America. And neither do you! It is only together—in you and me with all our differences on display—that America exists and freedom can reign.
A requiem is a lament—the wailing of a heart broken—a song of sadness that emanates from deep within the soul. Throughout human history these songs have accompanied the death of a warrior. Russ Calvin was such a warrior—a man who battled and wrestled in spiritual realms so that we might enjoy God’s blessings in the physical one. He was my friend, Worship Pastor, and brother-in-the-faith. And today I choose to put my sadness in words to encourage others on their own journey. Perhaps it will push you farther, higher, or deeper in your own excursion through life.
Russ was a gentle giant, whose passionate pursuit of God leaves deep footprints to follow for those of us still chasing after God. Russ finally caught the Savior whom he had run after throughout his short lifetime. Thirty-seven years seems so young—so brief, yet Russ accomplished more in that limited span than most of us will in a long lifetime. He made time count, knowing that none of us is promised tomorrow.
Russ was soft-spoken, not loud and boisterous. But when he spoke, the volume, tenor, and depth of what he said often rang like a clap of thunder. When he spoke of Jesus, it was not the platitudes of a preacher or the clichés of a theologian, but rather the experience of a lover who had experienced the heart-to-heart connection of genuine intimacy with God. Russ knew God, not facts and figures about God. They were on a first name basis—a beloved Father and his treasured son. You can fake a lot of things, but you can’t fake what it’s like to have been in the intimate presence of God. Russ knew—he’d spent long spans of precious time in that secret place.
Russ was also a man who knew and understood God’s Word. His grasp of God’s promises was not a shallow one. No, he staked his life, his marriage, and his ministry on the fact that God cannot lie. In the midst of the suffering he endured as he battled heart and kidney issues, Russ refused to let go of or give up on any of the promises God had whispered into his spirit. He tenaciously hung onto those promises like a bulldog. He stood faithful when many who were treating him gave him no hope. Russ believed God, and he acted on that faith. He spoke it. He prayed it. He shared it with doctors, nurses, technicians, strangers, and friends. He obeyed the words God had given him—he acted on the revelation whispered to him by the Holy Spirit. Obedience is the outward sign of an inward belief. Russ heard the Word—then he acted by obeying the Word—the promises given to him by the God who cannot lie!
Russ was a spiritual warrior. He understood the battlefield and his ancient foe. His calling was a simple, yet profound one. He had been commissioned to enforce the victory of Calvary, to destroy the works of the devil, and to be a vessel God could use to set the captives free. Spiritual warfare was not a theory to discuss for Russ. No! It was a daily life and death wrestling match to engage in. He knew what it took to snatch souls from the jaws of the hounds of hell and he was willing to engage those demonic mongrels if it meant freedom for another person. He was feared by hell and empowered by heaven.
Russ did what he could do with what he had to work with. His complaints were few—just a wish that he could do more, serve more, share more, or worship more. He was limited by the weakness of his heart—but not anymore! He fought through debilitating pain, weakness, discouragement, and frustration—but not anymore! He was limited, constrained, and unable to do many of the things he longed to do—but not anymore! Russ is now free—free to worship without restraint or limit. He is free to dance. He is free to lift his hands like an eagle spreading its wings to heaven. He is free to run, to jump, and to spin in utter unbounded joy. And best of all, Russ is free to sing with an unrestrained voice that cannot be silenced by disease, death, or even the devil.
I could sing a sad lament, a wretched requiem, but if I did it would have to be about someone other than Russ. Yes, we are separated from Russ for a time, but Russ is not dead. No he is more alive than he has ever been. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living according to Jesus. You see—God cannot lie! Russ is alive and he is enjoying the literal presence of the One whom he chased after so hard.
In the meantime, all of us need to get after it while we still can. Pursue God with all your strength. Russ did! Love people with all your heart. Russ did! Don’t worry about those things you can’t do—do the things you can. Russ did! Worship the Lord with total abandonment. Russ did! Trust God’s promises, walk them out, and enjoy every one of them. Russ is!
Stunned describes the way I feel today. A phone call early today knocked the breath out of me and it seems almost impossible to catch it now. Late night or early morning phone calls are never bearers of good news. This one wasn’t either.
As a pastor, most people expect you to say the “right” things at the “right” moment so that those who are suffering might feel “right” once again. But there are no words to say that can make anyone feel “right” once their life has been marred by death.
Today, I am not the pastor with the “right” words (I never have been because those guys really don’t exist)—I am just another human being struggling with my own emotions at the loss of a dear, dear friend. I’m processing the reality of the moment and not getting very far. Shocked is another word that expresses my state of mind. All those questions we are afraid to ask, like why? and how? are relentlessly pursuing me, clamoring for an appointment in my mind, intent on way-laying my faith in Jesus Christ.
Therefore I choose to write the words I can’t seem to formulate with my tongue or lips. Words come hard at times like these. They seem cheap if they come too fast. This morning I just hugged my friend’s mate and cried…there are no words that will make the moment better. But perhaps these words will remind others who knew Johnny well of the sort of stuff he was made of.
The memory of his smile has illumined my day today. Every time I thought of him—I could see his pearly whites. He was not a somber, gruff man as so many are. His smile disarmed you—made you willing to take another look. It was not phony smile of someone hiding something or the bogus beauty queen smile we all know so well. That million dollar grin mirrored the state of his soul. His smile emanated from the inside; it was not just window-dressing on the outside. It was genuine—real—one hundred percent sincere. Johnny’s smile was capable of knocking walls down and reaching into the hearts and souls of those who needed a touch of compassionate attention.
That smile was often followed by a laugh. If you knew Johnny you know what I’m talking about. If you didn’t—well it was laced with a certain kind of joy and echoed a grace that is sort of indescribable. Let me put it this way—if Santa ever needed a day off, Johnny could have slid right it, taken the old guys job, and none of us would have known the difference. That laugh put you at ease. It took the edge off tough situations with its disarming tenor. It made you feel comfortable and confident. It lifted you up and made you realize that he was a real guy in a real world doing the best that he could. Perhaps that’s the best word to describe his laugh—real.
In fact, real describes Johnny the best. There was far more to him than what meets the eye. He was far more than a pretty face. Johnny had a servant’s heart. He had trouble telling others “No.” It was a word I don’t ever remember him using. If you needed something and he knew it, he made himself available to do whatever needed to be done and more. If you asked him for help, you could count on him.
Johnny loved people, kids, and animals—and not necessarily in that exact order. He treated all of them with love and respect, and in most cases the kids and the animals responded. I can still see him riding his horse Colonel in the local Christmas parades—blue jeans, big gold buckle, boots, Stetson, and having the time of his life or training his Blue Healers with their bandannas tied smartly around their necks.
My mind is alive with memories of driving through Tennessee Amish country looking for good deals on syrup and horse tack, loading trailers on a Sunday morning at the birth of a new church or chuckling together in the aftermath of rabid raccoon bite and its subsequent pain-filled treatments. I will especially treasure my memories of Johnny willingness to do whatever was needed on Sunday morning as we struggled to put together a credible worship service that would not embarrass God.
Perhaps what I’m trying to say with these inept words that keep filling my mind, but failing mightily, is Johnny was far more than a friend…he was family. And family matters!

A Statue of Alan Sheppard, the First American in Space, Welcomes Visitors into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame at the Kennedy Space Center, Fla.
“One of my heroes was John Glenn. My mother let me play hooky from school to watch his mission. And the drama and the class with which he performed that mission was really neat,“ rocket man Jerry L. Ross told me when I asked the hero who his hero was.
Last November, my space geekiness led me Florida’s Space Coast and the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex for a media event celebrating the opening of Heroes and Legends and U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame presented by Boeing. It also gave me an opportunity to speak with Jerry L. Ross, an astronaut who was the first (and only) person to launch into space SEVEN times, making him a true rocket man. He was with the space shuttle program from beginning to end and was inducted into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame in 2014.
“I wrote three books in the first three years after retired and my wife and I are really enjoying traveling around the world, around the country. One of my goals was to visit every major league baseball park in the country and I have one left to go,” he told me when I asked what he is enjoying during his retirement.
In his Indiana hometown of Crown Point, the elementary school is named for him. At least once every three years he visits the school to speak with every student. Interestingly, he told me his autobiography (Spacewalker: My Journey in Space and Faith as NASA’s Record-Setting Frequent Flyer) and the children’s version (Becoming a Spacewalker: My Journey to the Stars) are geared toward kids.
What’s very interesting and a testament to Becoming a Spacewalker is that it has been given to every fourth grade teacher in Indiana and lesson plans for teachers are available on his website www.jerrylross.com.
When meeting with children, he says he tries “to encourage them to figure out what their God-given talents are, what their likes and dislikes are and how they might use those in their adult life and career. And then to encourage them to set goals for themselves, to study hard, work hard and not to give up too easily in the pursuit of those goals.”
“I certainly had my share of…frustrations,” he told me when I asked if he had obstacles in achieving his goals and what he tells kids, “I didn’t get selected for test pilot school the first time I applied. I didn’t get selected to astronaut office the first time I applied.
“You just have to work harder the next time, rededicate yourself to it and maybe try a slightly different approach and not give up. Because if things have been so important for you so long, they should remain such and you should not get so frustrated that you quit.”
The Exterior of the Heroes and Legends and U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame has a Sculpture of the Mercury 7 Astronauts Who Were NASA’s First Astronauts.
Ross was at KSCVC with fellow U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame member Karol “Bo” Bobko celebrating the opening of Legends and Heroes and the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame Presented by Boeing. Now, you may think every astronaut is included but I learned while speaking with hall of famers, there is an actual process which includes astronauts nominating someone then voting on inductees. As of May 2017, there are 95 astronauts in the hall of fame.
Technically, the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame is not new. It was previously located down the road from the primary attractions at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex but a gorgeous new building was erected and the hall of fame has been relocated and paired with the new Legends & Heroes exhibit. The hall of fame’s new location just inside the entrance gates of KSCVC makes it more accessible for people to celebrate America’s space explorers easier.
This new attraction adds an emotional background and context for space exploration. It complements other features at KSCVC and adds the human element with the What is a Hero? brief film in the 360-degree discovery bay. (Keep a tissue handy.) Next is the 3-D Through the Eyes of a Hero film in which you journey through the mind and eyes of NASA’s first heroes and legends. This humanizes the space exploration industry by giving you the perspective of what some astronauts gone through.
The A Hero Is… exhibit highlights nine attributes astronauts have with each having its own module where you can see artifacts tied to the space program and hear stories from these space explorers. Some of the attributes include, courageous, tenacious, passionate and selfless. Also included is the Mercury Mission Control room with original consoles. Watch astronaut Eugene Cernan perform a spacewalk and John Glenn’s landing of Friendship 7 on the moon.
Walking into the final exhibit, a grand sculpture called “The Spirit of Space” welcomes visitors and features a patriotic rocket man, Alan B. Shepard Jr., the first American in space. This is the entry into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame where glass plaques each with an etched portrait of hall of fame members line the walls and an interactive console allows visitors to look up each inductee and view their accomplishments. There’s also a selfie option to pull up your favorite astronaut and snap a photo with them.
The Heroes and Legends and U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame presented by Boeing is a reminder that while there are heroes who have done extraordinary things and earned national and international accolades, there are heroes around us in our everyday life. If you haven’t, take time to let those heroes know how much you appreciate them.

I’ll keep the football analogies to a minimum but the end of the month in which France won the World Cup seems an appropriate moment to reflect on the pluses and minuses of the season so far. For wine growers, or viticulteurs, the business end of the season will soon be upon us.
Following on from a wet winter and a thoroughly damp spring, the start of the summer has been dry and hot. In fact, of the last 44 days, 22 have seen temperatures over 30°C around Bordeaux, with another 14 days over 28°C. July itself has been the third hottest in France since 1947, still behind 2006 and 1983 but knocking 2015 into fourth spot.
In that six weeks or so since a largely successful flowering, we had some useful rain at the end of June and start of July, and after that it’s been dry, although some areas had a mid-month downpour. This glorious, sunny patch has been great for the vines, as hydric stress has a way of convincing the vines to concentrate on fruit production rather than on further vegetative growth. Cool nights (around 16°C) have been good for bunches of young grapes and holidaymakers alike.
The dial will be turned up several notches later this week, however, with daytime temperatures in the mid to high thirties as a heat-wave moves up from the south, and we will no doubt see some vines suffer in the burning sun. Younger vines on drier ground are most at risk, and the forecast is for no rain through mid-August. (Perhaps we’ll see limited irrigation being permitted, as in the Rhône valley this summer.) We have a long way to go as the grapes have only just started changing colour, and there’s a while before the ripening period proper in the run up to harvest, yet too much heat and stress now and the vines can effectively switch off, so we have to hope that the torrid heat will ease off swiftly.
Looking further back to understand the water levels, and for a more complete picture than that provided by my local weather station, I’ve taken the figures from the same six stations I normally use as these are dotted around the main vineyard regions of Bordeaux.
Last Autumn was quite dry with October and November 2017 registering 18mm and 70mm of rain against a 30-year average of 93mm and 110mm respectively. Then it fairly poured down in the winter. In December 2017, 156mm v 106mm average, and 155mm in January 2018, almost double the average of 87mm. February rainfall was about average, with 66mm v 72mm average.
March rain was well above average, so, on top of the winter rain, we might have had plenty of water in reserve but we also had soggy vineyards that were hard to access by tractor for maintenance work and for spraying when the time came. The vines kick into life with bud break in April, and April, May and June saw rainfall at slightly higher levels than the average, but nothing untoward once summer kicked in post mid-June. Just look at the comparable months of 2016, and most of us in Bordeaux would be happy if we ended up with a season and the resulting wine like that. That year, I recall, we had a drought from 23 June to 13 September. (Here at Bauduc we’ve had 360mm of rain from March to July in 2018, with almost a third of that handily back in March, compared to the combined Bordeaux 2016 figure in the grid of 342mm.)
This has been the fourth dry July on the trot, though the difference with 2018 is that it’s been much hotter than the last two years as we’ve seen – over 2°C warmer than the average in Bordeaux and indeed 2°C above 2017. June too was warmer at 20.5°C compared to the average of 19.3°C, May was on a par with the average and April much warmer. These elements were good for vine growth and for the flowering in June, but also for the increased threat of mildew in the humid conditions.
Every week, our suppliers would send us a mildew risk assessment as ‘favorable’, meaning, somewhat conversely, that conditions were favourable for the mildew but not for the grower. We’ve had the toughest test against mildew since the dodgy 2013 season and some vineyards have really struggled to keep this fungal ‘maladie’ at bay – it can impact bunches as well as leaves. Our team have done a great job and we’ve had only minimal impact on the red and no mildew at all on the white, but I have been fairly surprised to see some pretty well-managed properties really struggle, with mildew clearly evident in the vineyards. The vast majority of top châteaux though have coped well in this regard and the vines look verdant and healthy, but mildew has indeed been an issue.
Yields meanwhile look very promising, despite some rain in the first half of June during the floraison.
Others have not been so lucky, because in 2018 there have been several storms, often accompanied by hail warnings. Whereas in 2017 a widespread frost at the end of April resulted in a substantial loss for the region as a whole, hailstorms have wreaked havoc on vineyards in a number of really unlucky appellations this year. Following a localised hailstorm in the Médoc on 21 May, the most devastating storm on 26 May took out thousands of hectares in Bourg and Blaye and in the southern end of the Haut-Médoc. It had begun in the northern Graves and ripped through parts of the city of Bordeaux on its journey north towards Cognac. (I covered this in a post at the end of May.)
This month, on Sunday 15th July – the very day that France won the football World Cup – hailstorms battered vineyards in Sauternes, the Haut-Médoc (again), the Côtes de Bourg (again) and to a lesser extent near Fronsac. The vines at châteaux like de Fargues in Sauternes and La Lagune in the Haut-Médoc took a hell of a beating. For some, it was the second season in a row that disaster struck, after being hit by the late spring frost in 2017.
Losing your crop to hail, above, is the stuff of nightmares and the recent sight of rows upon rows of damaged vines, once again, never fails to fill me with a sense of shock and, of course, pity for the grower.
We make wine at Chateau Bauduc for Rick Stein, Gordon Ramsay, Hotel du Vin and hundreds of private customers in the UK. Distribution elsewhere is via a few deranged wine merchants.

Abby is an 18 year old amateur teen that works at a sub sandwich restaurant. I went inside to purchase a sub sandwich and this sexy teen
was the person to take my order! I instantly took the opportunity to speak with her about my amateur nude modeling website while she
continued to prepare my sandwich. Since business was so slow that night, I was actually able to speak with her for about 30 minutes with
nobody else even around! She had a lot of questions about the modeling, and was even a little hesitant at first about getting naked on the
internet for everyone in the world to see, but as we continued to speak with each other, this amateur teen finally told me that she would be
willing to try the amateur nude modeling! Watch this 18 year old amateur teen strip down and model nude for you!

You look A LOT better like this. No makeup shows off your true natural beauty. You look so carefree and happy here. You are far more approachable like this. My guess is this is how you are most of the time in life - no makeup on. I'd much rather see pix of you like this than all made up. Put makeup on a pig - it is still a pig. Makeup can turn ugly women into beautiful ones. It is the rare few - like you - who can go makeup free and look better than all made up. Pleaase - MUCH MORE like this
Take a look at that hot and amateur "girl next door" brunette teen! Her name is JC and these pictures (along with many others) were

Hey Cam50! Oh gosh. It's probably been around 5 or 6 years years since I did this particular shoot, but she has 850 pictures that range from amateur modeling (which is the vast majority of them) to handjob pictures, blowjob pictures and sex pictures showing her getting fucked twice, with one of them being a creampie. As far as what she has done, she has not really done a lot, but she did shoot for a couple of other producers after shooting with me.
But yes, all of the content on my website is (and always has been) shot exclusively by myself. Glad you like her look. :)

I just rediscovered bombshell Meet Audrey AKA Stunning Misty, tall chick – sometimes brunette, sometimes blonde, sadly retired these days -- with exotic erotic face, striking body and all the right parts, including very sexy hands sporting dramatic ultra bold blue veins that stand out quite prominently on her sexy hands – very fit & hot!
Claire is such a natural looking girl and I also think that she's pretty darn hot too! I've seen Claire with makeup on, and I much prefer her to go
without it, as she usually does just about all of the time. If you saw Claire today in a public establishment located in your local area, she would
look exactly as she does on the site! No fake looking and perfect 10 makeup covered supermodels here! Hope you all enjoy these amateur

Check out this big breasted and hot brunette babe smiling at that camera! Her name is Dulce and I established contact with her over at the shopping mall in the
Electronics store. She was looking though the music CD's and we started talking to each other about the various bands that were on the top shelf display. We
both found out that we were into the same type of music and really just basically hit it off ...and headed back to the house to shoot her modeling nude! I also
fucked her and blew my load inside of her pussy too. However, in this particular set of photos, you will see this hot brunette babe stripping down nude and
getting into all sorts of poses and positions! Doesn't she have some nice amateur breasts? Hope you all enjoy these high resolution modeling pictures of Dulce!

I apologize for the long delay in updating this blog, I’ve just been suffering from writers block while dealing with my frustration at the current Indian government. I told myself I would stay away from comparing 9/11 to the Mumbai Massacre but it’s just not possible. This massacre was a combination of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina all rolled into one. Granted this attack was on a scale never seen before but the government’s inaction is like a page from the Hurricane Katrina playbook – do nothing. And yes, we’ve already had our “Brownie, you’re doing a heck of a job” moment, RR Patil the Maharashtra Home Minister has been quoted as saying “such small incidents happen.”
The attacks on South Bombay have hit home for me. Friends would visit Bombay and see the lack of infrastructure, the poverty and the overall craziness of Bombay and would ask why I love Bombay and my answer was simple “I live like a king.” Well, in an instant I’m starting to rethink if it’s worth it. I can’t even count how many times I have visited the Taj Palace this year, it’s like a 2nd home for many of my friends and family. During the attacks I was receiving emails from people that had visited Bombay and they all said the same basic thing – “I heard about the attacks, hope you are safe. Oh my god I stayed at the Taj Palace, I can’t believe it.”
I’ve put together a timeline of the events as they occurred from a personal point of view, which includes a story of a very, very close friend – SJ. Her story is nothing short of heart-breaking.
9:15pm – Picked up my sister and nieces from the Airport, they were in India for a wedding. We were driving to the JW Marriot in Juhu to check-in.
9:40pm – Get a call from my wife’s business partner – SJ, she was at Golden Dragon celebrating her husband’s birthday with family. She told us to be safe because there was gunfire at the Taj Palace and the rumor was they were targeting other 5 star hotels – JW Marriott included.
10pm – We rollup to the JW Marriott, the plan was for my sister to check-in and then we would leave. However, we end up ordering food and start to watch the news…it becomes apparent the situation was spiraling out of control and decide to stay at the hotel with my sister.
Midnight – On TV they report gun fire outside the JW Marriott, I call my driver who was outside and ask him what’s the situation. He said it was quiet and the cops were patrolling the streets.
1:30am – Get a call from SJ saying they are in the Taj Chambers and locked in by the staff. She was afraid but everyone felt comfortable with the Taj staff.
7:30am – We call SJ and she explains how she had escaped with her parents around 3:30am, but still waiting for her husband and father/mother/sister-in-law.
5pm – Local TV is saying the seige at the Taj is over and all hostages have been freed (inaccurate).
7:30pm – I leave the JW Marriott with my wife to be with SJ for several hours, we head to Pedder Road. Leaving the JW where my sister and nieces were was one of the toughest decisions I had to make, however seeing the security detail I felt relieved and assured. We get stuck at Worli for about 30 minutes as the Prime Minister’s 42 car entourage passes through (they had AK-47’s).
8:30pm – We reach SJ’s in-law’s house and it’s just a scene you don’t ever want to witness. We get word that SJ’s sister-in-law is alive but in critical condition.
11pm – We head back to the JW Marriott so I can be with my sister and nieces. It was eerie that there were no cops on the road as we head back, the only place we saw cops was back at the JW Marriott. I was thinking back to 9/11 where the 405 highway in Los Angeles had cops everywhere for weeks and that was 2800 miles from ground zero.
10am – We check out of the hotel and drop my sister and nieces off at the airport so they can fly to Goa for a wedding, I was relieved at this point. Then we proceed to Pedder Road.
2pm – We head for the last rites that were given to SJ’s husband, father-in-law and mother-in-law. Rumors of gunshots at CST and Napeansea Road make the rounds. For 2 hours the local cable system was cut to fight the rumors and inaccurate reporting.
9am – The Taj Palace is finally in control of the NSG, it took almost 60 hours to secure a single hotel.
10:30a – Ratan Tata, CEO of Tata Sons and owner of Taj Palace is on the grounds to survey the damage.
During this massacre there were players that showed leadership and others that should be taken behind a tool shed and violated with a rusted knife (don’t ask).
NSG personnel – the elite force that brought the massacre to an end at 3 locations – Taj, Oberoi/Trident and Nariman House.
Shobha De, socialite turned activist – very outspoken against the government’s inaction and calling for resignations.
Taj and Oberoi/Trident staff – I’ve heard nothing but praise from people within the Taj Palace during the massacre.
Ratan Tata – He was on the grounds of the Taj Palace within 90 minutes of the NSG taking control. The Prime Minister and other government officials were nowhere to be found.
Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh – his speech within hours of the massacre was unintelligible and uninspiring, he makes George Bush look like a Rhodes Scholar.
President of India, Pratibha Patil – No comment from her, of course this post is more of a ceremonial post which is all the more reason for her to speak since her calender is free
Indian Home Minister, Shivraj Patil – speechless, I meant him not me (he just announced his resignation).
Maharashtra Chief Minister, V. Deshmukh – complained he didn’t get specific information on the attack, was he expecting a call from them?
Maharashtra Home Minister, RR Patil said the incident was small, he heard the terrorists wanted to kill 5,000 people, so anything under that number shows how effective the government was.
Mayor of Bombay, Dr. Shubha Raul – Yet another ceremonial post. The one big benefit of this position is you get to live in a massive mayoral compound, not bad for doing nothing.
Bombay police management team – not much can be expected from them since most carry nothing more then a lathi – yes only a wood stick.
But the award for the biggest loser goes to Raj Thakery and his MNS supporters. For the past 8 months we’ve had to listen to his nonsense about how Bombay is for his people (Maharashtrians) and his retarded slogan “Amchi Mumbai” which means Our Bombay. According to him only Maharashtrians should live here and everyone should speak the local language – Marathi. Yet, when the city was attacked the MNS must have been at home drinking tea and eating vada pav’s.
Since Obama doesn’t technically start his term till January 20th, I wish India could hire him till then
I did my bit of defiance today when running on Marine Drive near the Oberoi, I flipped off a government entourage of 15 vehicles.

Who doesn’t love a little lace dress? It’s elegant, classy and flattering for all shapes and sizes. This gorgeous number by CeCe by Cynthia Steffe is a great transitional dress that can be worn from spring to summer or from summer to fall with just the right accessories.
Wear it with a crisp ivory blazer and pumps for a summer polished look or with a jean jackt and booties for a casual outdoor summer concert. To transition the dress into fall, style with a black blazer and pumps for a formal event.

The Royal Adelaide Wine Show (or RAWS, for the sake of sanity) wrapped up at the beginning of October.
After the best part of a week of solid tasting and general hard work on the part of the judges, the Showground doors were flung open to a small group of media.
Nick Ryan, Matthew Jukes and Michael Brajkovich MW talked us through the wine show process and then let us loose on a bracket of Chardonnay and a bracket of Shiraz.
Wine shows (and, indeed, scoring in general) can be a little controversial – because obviously how a wine looks at any moment in time is highly subjective. At a show, in an attempt to even this out, wines are judged by panels and gold medal winning wines are looked at more than once.
If you spend enough time around wine geeks, you’ll realise that it doesn’t take long for everyone’s preferences to more or less fall in line. Wines that can be a tough sell in the retail market are often beloved of professionals and hardened enthusiasts. Yep – there’s a reason why Riesling is so cheap (thank goodness) – it’s not the darling of consumers.
We tasted two flights of six wines (Chardonnay and Shiraz) – and in advance we were told that there were three gold medal winning wines (including the trophy), one silver, one bronze and an also-ran.
While wines (at the Adelaide Show) are scored on a 20 point scale, in reality only 10 of those points are used. Wines scoring 18.5 and above are gold, 17 – 18.5 results in silver and 15.5 – 17 a bronze. Below 15, no medal is awarded. About 5% of wines are awarded a gold medal and approximately 50% get a medal of some type.
Your average, drinkable, clean, but otherwise unremarkable wine will score around 15 – so in order to be awarded any kind of medal a wine does have to be a bit special.
We started with the 2013 Chardonnays – a class of originally around 50 wines before moving on to the 2014 Shiraz – originally around 180 wines! Shiraz REALLY dominates at the Adelaide show … I can’t imagine why!
What I found most fascinating about this exercise was where the ‘amateurs’ and the ‘professionals’ diverged. This was most evident in the Shiraz class where, for me, the ‘also ran’ stuck out like a sore thumb. And I mean REALLY stuck out. However, while I picked it I also knew that it was representative of a style of wine that is also very popular and I wasn’t surprised at all that the room was split.
Many of us did score it down but just as many people loved it and scored it highly. I’d scored it a 15 – out of medal contention – but after a chat with Matthew Jukes revised that score down to a 13. He said that with a wine such as this, he would always score it down because there could well be someone on the panel who, for whatever reason, scores it surprisingly highly. When the average of the panel’s scores is taken, your 15 might be just enough to bump it up into bronze medal territory. There you go – strategic scoring is not just for reality tv!
This was a great morning – it is always interesting to learn about wine and taste something new. And of course, meeting Matthew Jukes and Michael Brajkovich MW and talking wine with them was a real treat*. I loved that this was a small group – it meant that it was intimate and friendly and everyone got a chance to have some input without feeling any more intimidated than you might do with an MW in the room!
It was especially interesting because the next day I attended the RAWS lunch and got to taste a whole lot more medal winning wine – not all of which was my cup of tea! I think it’s so important to remember that wine is about so much more than a score or a medal. As this session showed, everyone’s taste is different.
* Not saying that seeing Nick wasn’t a treat – it’s just that he’s based in Adelaide and not hard to find at wine events! 😀

So, you’ve just arrived at your new university. You’ve unpacked, organized your stuff – now it’s time to get out there and meet your flatmates. Moving to a new country or city can be scary, especially when you don’t know anyone. However, even if you’re shy it’s easier than you think to make friends at university.
It all starts with this one simple word. Simply saying ‘hello’ to one of your new flatmates or the person you sit next to in lectures can be the start of a brilliant friendship. Be brave – the worst that could happen is that they don’t reply.
Still feel like you don’t know what to say? Use these handy conversation tips from the Huffington post and you’ll be chatting away in no time.
With today’s technology, it’s easier than ever to meet new people. Search for groups for your university and halls and residence. Before moving to Manchester to study I had already joined a dozen university Facebook groups. On my first night in halls, I went to an event organized on social media.
Speaking to members of the group online beforehand meant there was no awkwardness when we finally met in person – we were like old friends!
All work and no play makes for a dull student experience. Societies and clubs are a great way to relax and meet like-minded people. So get yourself down to the Fresher’s Fair and sign up for some societies and activities.
Each university has literally hundreds of societies so you’re bound to find something that interests you. There is something for everyone from gaming to dancing, film to mountain climbing, knitting and much, much more.
Most student halls are a melting pot of cultures, backgrounds, religions, and beliefs. Just because someone isn’t the type of person you would usually hang out with doesn’t mean you won’t become good friends.
Taking the initiative and throwing a party is a great way to make new friends at university. Most people will want to meet their fellow students so they’ll be grateful to you for making it happen.
It doesn’t have to be anything fancy – just sharing a few drinks and some snacks is a great start. Just don’t break the rules of your accommodation and be prepared for your new friends asking for help every time they need something organized!
Moreover, if you want to ask more questions about studying abroad, do not hesitate and join Hellouni community! Register on our website and get in contact with ambassadors from various universities around the world.
University: they say it’s the best time of your life. You’ll meet new friends and learn new skills. Most importantly it’s a chance to spread your wings and gain some independence. Perhaps that’s why so many students are traveling from their home country to study in the UK.
A degree from a top university can set you apart from the pack when looking for jobs. The UK has four of the top ten ranked universities in the world. British universities are also respected for research – producing around 15% of the world’s most frequently cited papers.
Studying in the UK is an amazing opportunity to improve your English language skills. A quarter of the world’s population speak English so improving language skills is key for careers in business, finance and a whole range of other subjects.
Not only that, but learning English will be a great help when traveling in other countries – the odds are that someone there will speak it too!
International students are usually allowed up to 20 hours paid work a week during term time. Just enough to fund that well-deserved night out!
Let’s face it; even the most dedicated student won’t work 24/7. Luckily the UK has a rich cultural heritage for students to explore. London is a must-do, the home of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II and Sherlock Holmes.
If we’re honest, we think this is a major reason you need to come to study in the UK. No British student experience is complete without a Sunday roast with your housemates or a trip to the beach for some fish and chips. Mmmm.
Travel is all about embracing the weird and wonderful traditions of the country you’re in. Luckily the UK has a range of odd customs like dancing around the maypole, burning a pretend man on a bonfire on November 5th and rolling cheese down a hill (honestly, this is true).
Yes, we’re a nation of oddballs, and we love it. We know we mentioned food before, but the number one British tradition you must try is Afternoon Tea. Anyone for a scone?
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland each have their own unique culture and customs. Traveling between the four is simple to check out the beauty of Northern Ireland, play the bagpipes in Scotland and experience a rugby match in Wales.
UK university courses are generally shorter than those in other countries. You’ll get your degree from a high-ranking university in less time, meaning less money spent on rent, tuition and living costs. What’s not to like?
The UK has always been welcoming of students from abroad. In London over a quarter of the student population are international. This means support is in place: meaning help with accommodation or simply suggestions on things to do. So don’t stress – we’ve got this.
On the blog post for this month I am going to write about software frameworks in general, and web application frameworks in particular. Frameworks are not a new concept. In fact, they have been around for about 30-35 years now, and they are constantly used in software projects of all kinds and sizes.
Software developers not only create new software, but what they do for most of their time is to maintain software created by other people. Therefore it is important to rely on a series of shared principles and some sort of rational structure, which is at the same time both open and general enough.
Usually this is achieved using software frameworks. Regardless the stack or the technology employed, frameworks allow developers to concentrate their efforts in the actual functional requirements while abstracting other tasks that deal with non-functional requirements (usually low-level parts like those related to the networking or database connections). Due to this, software projects can scale their development times down while their mainteninability improves. However, software frameworks also have some drawbacks. In particular, they produce a great deal of codebloat, wasting resources and making the code not as efficient as an equivalent specific-made solution. They also have a learning curve that slows the development at early adoption stages. Hence, although it is true that they reduce developing times in the long-term, it is actually the opposite in the short-term.
Extensibility: developers can modify the framework to fit the requirements, improve the performance or override some functionality.
Architecture-wise, and irrespective of the problem they try to solve, frameworks are basically inter-related components made of two types of code:
Frozen spots: these are the portions of code that are not part of the business logic of the application and that barely change.
Hot spots: these are the portions of code that contain the business logic of the application. These are where the developers inject their code, and hence vary from one application to another.
A particular type of software frameworks is the web application frameworks. These are designed to provide a general solution to the problem of building web applications, no matter whether it is for banking, e-commerce, customer service or a news service. Usually web application frameworks are implementations of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern where:
The way this pattern works (at high level) is very simple: the Controller corresponds to the API. This Controller (the API) receives the input from the users (the View), makes changes to the Model (the data) and pushes the results back to the View (or the web pages rendered in the browser).
As I mentioned earlier, frameworks abstract all the connections amongst the different application components. In the particular case of the web application frameworks they provide an interface to some kind of database management system (DBMS), and they provide a server to handle the clients requests. In addition they also provide (or may provide) user authentication/security, session management, AJAX sub-framework, or a templating system. And since all this is provided for free, what developers only have to do is to define the model(s) (i.e., the data structure(s) required by the system), the computations required to fulfill the requirements (i.e., the controller(s)) and the interface rendered to the users (the view(s)).
From all the previous, it might seem that the use of this type of frameworks force the adoption of a thin-client architecture (where most of the computations are done at server-side). Traditionally this has been the case (for example with Django, ASP.Net, or more recently –and to some extent– with Sails). Yet in more recent times frameworks like ReactJS or AngularJS have favoured the thick-client architectures (where most of the computations are done at client-side). At the end of the day, this architecture choice relies more on design and business decisions than the frameworks themselves.
And this is the end of this gentle introduction to the concept of software frameworks. At ICAN Future Star we use different frameworks for developing our solutions. For example, AngularJS and ExpressJS have been used from the beginning. And currently we are transitioning to SailsJS. The experience so far has been positive and we hope they keep on helping us building robust products for our customers.

Barrow County Sheriff's Deputy Chris Hulett, right, kisses his bride Keni Carter during their wedding reception at Athens Regional Medical Center on Fri., Jan 29, 2010 in Athens, Ga.

Andrew Wickham does a trick on a BMX bicycle in front of the Chapel at University of Georgia on Tues., Jan 26, 2010 in Athens, Ga.
I was walking across campus to an otherwise unphotogenic assignment through the blustery wind and out of the corner of my eye, i saw this guy doing tricks on a BMX bike in front of the Chapel.
I knew that one story had already fallen through visually and what i was off to photograph was something that was photographed two or three times last week. So if i could pull off a dominant visual, it could lead the front page. Such is the way of life in community journalism.
I worked it for about 10 minutes, made a few nice frames and the one above ended up the front page image.
Georgia forward Trey Thompkins (33) goes for a slam dunk as Tennessee faces Georgia in the first half of an NCAA men's basketball game at Stegeman Coliseum on Sat. Jan. 23, 2010 in Athens, Ga. (AP Photo/David Manning)
Generally at basketball I will set up a few remote cameras. Sometimes you get positive results and sometimes you pull it off and then some.
It was an interesting shoot. I had two white lightnings grid'ed from the rear corners with warming gels on them and two speedlights with 1/4 grids on them coming from the sides. As for a fill I was using my orbis ringflash with a CTO gel on it.
I'm still trying to master using this ringflash. I like it for a fill and I'm sure it will look great for fashion. However the third time out of the gate, it fell apart. So I'm not 100% sure about durability but I'm in contact with Orbis and I'm sure that there will be a good resolution.
Patterson Hood, lead singer for the Drive By Truckers, joins kids from the Camp Amped band from Nuci's Space on stage as they play the 40 Watt Club in Athens, Ga on Thurs. Jan 14, 2010. Playing with the Camp Amped band were Hunter Hulsey on keyboard, left, Nick Brown, drums, Phil Carpenter, guitar, singer Shelby Moss and Gabriella Mejias playing bass.
It has been a LONG TIME since I've listened to anything that could even remotely be considered Goth/Industrial/Darkwave. Probably about 10 years.
I criticized my work from the first time i saw this show. I wasn't happy. It wasn't how this band SHOULD look or how I wanted my photos to look.
The fun part of learning & following the Athens scene is learning about new bands. Playing with Thieves Market at Tastey World were Gerinomo and Peaches. Or thats what they perfomred as.
Amber and the gang with Thieves Market played Monday night at Tastey World. Always a good venue to see a show in.

Brooke George of Clemson dives during 3-meter springboard competition during the Georgia Diving Invitational and Shootout on Monday at Gabrielsen Natatorium at the University of Georgia on Monday, Jan. 4, 2010 in Athens, Ga.
Despite working around top-flight sports programs at UGA, I don't get to many of the tertiary or non-revenue sports that truly deserve the attention.
Swimming & Diving is one of them. Despite being ranked #1, having Olympians on their squad, and being coached by Jack Bauerle (who has Olympic Credentials), I've never gotten to any of their competitions. Until now. I've never shot diving before at the NCAA level and haven't at the HS level since Florida.
Now the Gabrielsen Natatorium here at UGA is a top flight facility. Light wasn't too bad thanks to the new cameras in the world, 2.8/1000th/3200 ISO And i got access - pool deck, and the 10m platform to shoot from as it was 3m and 1m going off at the same time. I could get more overhead of the 1m diving but the 3m dives were much more interesting. Getting on the 5m platform with a wide made a very interesting photo. Alas this would be better suited with a remote in the future although the divers i shot wide were out of contention and during the prelims.

Tennessee diver Jill Pierce dives during 3-meter springboard competition during the Georgia Diving Invitational and Shootout on Monday at Gabrielsen Natatorium at the University of Georgia on Monday, Jan. 4, 2010 in Athens, Ga.
Tonight is going to be the most clear and dark sky that we've got for a long time because of how brutally cold its going to be. So i decided to try and photograph this old stone chimney i found at Lake Herrick on the Campus of the University of Georgia. Naturally, i wanted to try to do a night/star trail shot. I like that stuff. (ISO 100, f/4, 15 minutes)
Alas..... there's a bit of FAIL here. The sky glow from the Athens & the college just washes out the sky and totally kills the effect. Same with every church and landmark around here - someone always puts up a streetlight. Makes me jealous of those who live in the desert southwest.

“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel. ” - Maya Angelou
This is so very true. Maya Angelou was truly a remarkable poet. However I think we better not take this quote in an absolute sense, because if we were all concerned too much about how others react to what we said, we would hardly get chance to speak what we truly feel or think. So, speakers need to be considerate, listeners also need not to take everything personal. Everything takes efforts from both sides.
This is one of my favorite quote by Maya. I agree with your point of view on this quote. May be we should only think about people only in case we are doing wrong to them or making them feel worse about themselves.

The Foundation for Rural & Regional Renewal (FRRR) is a not-for-profit organisation that harnesses the power of collective investment between government, business and philanthropy to improve the lives of those living in rural, regional and remote Australia.
The Farina Restoration Group Inc. have been actively working with the FRRR for some considerable time, and now have a very positive relationship with them.
As the only Australian organisation offering small, discretionary grants, we are an important conduit for philanthropy to rural and regional communities. The collaborative approach we take is also quite unique, allowing groups with a common interest to leverage their investment.
Our work has both a national reach and local focus and is informed by place-based approaches to community development.
We strongly believe that community members are best-placed to understand community needs, wants and aspirations and we advocate community based solutions for community issues. Strong community leadership enables communities to be self-sustaining, resilient and adaptable to economic, social, cultural and environmental changes.
Our tax status also makes us unique: as an Item 1 DGR entity (see ATO endorsement), FRRR is able to receive funds from Item 2 DGR entities as it is covered by Subdivision 30-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and we are specifically listed as a recipient for deductible gifts under section 30-105.
Due to these broad powers, there is no need for the organisation receiving a grant to be a deductible gift recipient under tax law, however their project must be charitable and promote rural and regional renewal, regeneration and development.
FRRR can also receive donations from non-charitable organisations and provide tax deductible receipts; these funds are received into the FRRR Public Fund.

Then, I don't know how to manage my namelists (.input and .wps), if I have to change something about the nests. I also don't know what to do since I don't have wrfbdy d03.
Actually, these 2 files refer to my domain 03. At this step, I already changed my namelist.input from 4 domains to 2 domains, moving all corresponding columns: domain 3 becomes domain 1 and domain 4 becomes domain 2. Then, DX and DY should match with the new wrfinput files.
I did it as well in the namelist.wps because I needed to rerun real.exe so I can get a new wrfinput for domain 2 (actually domain 4).
When I run wrf.exe, I got mismatch between dx,dy file and namelist. It happens when I use wrfinput file from ndown. I also tried with the old wrfinputs from my 4 domains run (wrfinput_d03 as wrfinput_d01 and wrfinput_d04 as wrfinput_d02), but I have the same error.
When I use wrfinput_d01 (actually domain 03) and wrfinput_d02 (actually domain 04) got from real.exe I ran after ndown, it seems to work.
I'm trying to run a real WRF-LES, my case is 3 coarser domains with WRF and 2 finer domains with LES.
Tried to run real.exe with 5 domains but only simulate 3 coarser nested domains with WRF, then use ndown.exe with wrfout_d03* as a wrfout_d01* (from WRF simulations) and wrfinput_d04 as wrfndi_d02 (from real.exe), then rename the wrfbdy_d02 and wrfinput_d02, from ndown.exe, to wrfbdy_d01 and wrfinput_d01 then copy wrfinput_d05 from WRF simulation and rename to wrfinput_d02 then run WRF-LES. But it only simulates the new d01 previous d04 and not the new d02 previous d05.
ndown works for one nest level only. If you want to run multiple nests, you would have to repeat the ndown procedure.
I am using voiphopper on my linux system and I found some cdp packet. the program determined the ID of the VLAN.

I first became aware of Gollon’s work as I drifted through the art-dealing labyrinth of streets around Christie’s in St. James’ with my son Austin and friend, broadcaster and journalist Michael Murphy. One of Chris’ eye-catching paintings called out to me from a gallery window. Descending the art deco steps into the small space we were soon chatting with David Tregunna- Chris’s agent and close friend.
I was captivated by Chris’s paintings as I was of David’s sheer enthusiasm and genuine love. Its true to say that like the very best biographers, art-agents must love their subject and David has this affection for Chris in vast amounts. Both David and I jabbered for ages over our mutual love of Chris’s work on show and it was here that we hatched our plan to show Chris’s work in his home town. What strikes me about these paintings are their urgent vibrancy not just in the handling of paint but in the choice of subject – so full of narrative that you swear you can hear them speak.
I recall Francis Bacon telling me that a canvas needs to speak and I remember thinking “you’re barking Francis” but, later ,as my own journey in art continued, I learnt to see how a canvas gains its voice from the artist, if the artist has what it takes to impart the divine spark. Both Austin and Michael were entranced and became caught up in the moment with discussions of technique, style and meaning. Names such as Bacon, Stanley Spencer, Yeats were mentioned.
Works both in St James’ and the exhibition here at Visage gallery and in his previous exhibitions and commissions. The energy we see is the only similar thing that connects his work as I think each of Gollon’s paintings is unique. I’m thrilled and excited to be able to bring to you Chris Gollon’s latest work, not just for their investment value, but for the sheer, unadulterated beauty and vividness that Chris brings to every painting and my special thanks to David Tregunna for his commitment to this exhibition.

The Ellicott City Partnership (ECP) was heartbroken by the devastating flood our town experienced on Sunday, May 27, 2018.
The ECP reinstated our disaster relief fund and is grateful for the donations from fundraising events and individual donations. ECP was the only organization whose funds exclusively benefit affected business owners, property owners, and residents within the historic Ellicott City area, including Main Street and the West End (See ECP Charter Boundary map).
The grant application process for flood-affected residents, business owners, and property owners opened on Monday, July 30, 2018 through the Community Foundation of Howard County. The application process has closed and financial support requests are being reviewed.
Funds raised by the ECP after October 22, 2018 will be restricted to be used for longer-term recovery initiatives directly benefiting the ECP’s charter area.
In 2016, ECP collected and distributed over $1.85 million, all of which was used to assist the Historic District with disaster relief and recovery.
Our organization continues to work with all agencies to advocate and fund raise with the intention of restoring our beloved historic town and its community. Up to date information and relief resources are available at the links and pages below.

Access to resources has always been a challenge for women’s rights organizations throughout South Asia. The concept of human rights philanthropy, however, has grown more prominent in the past two decades, especially with the formation of many indigenous human rights funds. The creation of such funds challenged the “welfarist approach” of many traditional grantmakers and NGOs and helped to bring focus to the human rights framework.
SAWF believes that mobilization of women is essential for ensuring recognition and exercise of human rights. As women’s rights activists and organizations are crucial to this mobilization, the Fund is committed to supporting these change-makers by working with them to build their leadership and capacity, and to provide critical fiscal and technical support to them.
SAWF is committed to strengthening the women’s movement in Bangladesh, Nepal, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, by ensuring access to resources for women’s groups and individual women working for women’s rights and empowerment.
The strategy of the Fund has two key components: grantmaking to women and women’s groups working toward the advancement of women’s rights; and resource mobilization, to ensure that the women’s movements in the region have sustainable access to resources to undertake their work and address their priorities. Presently, SAWF’s grantmaking is divided into two main programs: the small grants program, to enable women’s groups and women’s activists, especially those working at the grassroots level, to access critical support required for an intervention; and the thematic grants program, which focuses on undertaking work on certain critical themes that require urgent action and support in the region.
The need of the hour for indigenous women’s human rights funds is to support movement-building and mobilization initiatives, especially at the grassroots level. This is essential for ensuring recognition and the exercise of human rights. Hence, the only way to bring about positive change is to ensure that the voices of the historically oppressed are the ones making the demands, leading the movement, and bringing about the change.

“Interdependence is and care to be as abundant the ideal of man as self-sufficiency. Man is a amusing being.”
My Integrative Intuitive Counseling plan with audience over the accomplished fifteen-plus years has accustomed me the bird’s-eye appearance of relationships and the dynamics circuitous in them from an active point of view.
One of the areas in which I had aboriginal glimpses of these realizations and acquaint in activity is that of relationships, abnormally adventurous relationships. It goes after adage that relationships are actual important to a lot of of us and represent an acutely important aspect of our animal experience, as Trine and Gandhi aloft so articulately bidding it. So of advance a lot of audience will wish advice on this breadth of their lives.
I’ve looked at many, abounding relationships over the accomplished several years, including those a applicant was circuitous in at the time of a session, those from a client’s past, and approaching relationships. I’ve aswell looked at nonromantic relationships, including those with friends, parents, children, added ancestors members, plan colleagues, etc. I accept added acquired acumen into how relationships plan (and why they do plan at times and generally do not work) and what the adroit or accidental factors to the dynamics accessible in this aspect of our lives may be. Over time, I gradually saw several factors that I feel access the dynamics and activity of relationships.
“The affair of two personalities is like the acquaintance of two actinic substances: if there is any reaction, both are transformed.”
“Relationships are like a dance, with arresting activity antagonism aback and alternating amid partners.”
Early on in searching at adventurous relationships I was primarily analysis how people’s energies resonated – or didn’t bell able-bodied – and how that active resonance amid the two of them afflicted both the dynamics of the accord and the absolute or abrogating aspects of what the humans in the accord were experiencing. Some people’s energies resonated absolutely well. Added people’s energies absolutely artlessly abraded.
For example, I’ve apparent relationships in which one person’s activity was cutting the other’s energy. This generally leads to the closing accepting activity afflicted and blank or constrained, absolutely not a affable way to feel in a relationship. I’ve aswell apparent relationships in which one person’s activity is balmy and all-embracing and the added person’s activity is acknowledgment or aloof and/or apprenticed or narrow. This is aswell not a acceptable alternation of energies. As cogent as these dynamics of activity resonances were, I came to apprentice in time, however, that there were factors circuitous added than just the resonance of energies that contributed to whether relationships were good, workable, or accurate ally or “soul mates.”
“How aboriginal is adulation that plants a annual and uproots a field; that revives us for a day and stuns us for an age!”
I anon came to see how people’s inauthentic accepting – their issues – afflicted the dynamics in a relationship. Because the inauthentic bury contributes to and affects one’s accepted energy, this inauthentic accepting will generally be allotment of what is resonating (or abrading) amid two people’s energies.
Often the cull amid two humans will be their “stuff” resonating, rather than who they absolutely are. For example, one of the added accepted manifestations of this blazon of resonance occurs if a abased accepting who may aswell be acute emotionally and/or arise from some array of calumniating accomplishments is romantically circuitous with anyone with able and authoritative energy; or if one accepting who is accessible emotionally and needs to affix and acquaint aboveboard with his/her accomplice is circuitous with anyone who is bankrupt down or aloof emotionally and appropriately neither accessible emotionally nor aggressive arise absolutely aboveboard abutting with someone. I accept apparent instances in which two people’s “stuff” is so circuitous and mutually resonating that they arise to fit calm like a circuitous arrangement of alternate keys applicable into anniversary other’s locks. Generally a action of button-pushing and/or alternate alternation in an ailing address after-effects from this blazon of resonance. (Hence, the appellation codependence.) Relationships of this blazon generally body a admixture of adverse energies; they may be love/hate relationships or be abounding of animation – and are rarely “clear sailing.” They are aswell frequently absolutely aching and can be emotionally draining.
This blazon of relationship, that is based on the inauthentic accepting resonating is often, as you may suspect, bedevilled to failure. I accept apparent abounding audience who were in this blazon of accord and who may accept ashore it out for years because they accept both attrition to and apathy over accepting out of the situation. Added audience may extricate themselves in a beneath aeon of time. If, how, and if these relationships are bound is usually a action of the individual’s action and advance and his/her address for or attrition to change.
Usually if the accommodation is fabricated to leave the relationship, it is because the accepting initiating that change has developed alone to the point area the claimed acquaint from the accord are abstruse and the accord no best serves a purpose or feels the same. In added words, the resonance is no best there. (This closing instance is adumbrative of the accepted abnormality that, as we apprentice and grow, we may abound accomplished the humans we’ve been abutting to, if they are not aswell evolving and growing. Kristen Zambucka declared this abnormality if she declared that, “We outgrow people, places, and things as we unfold. We may be afflicted if old accompany say their section and leave our lives…but let them go. They were at a altered date and searching in a altered direction.” This can be annoying to us, abnormally if we don’t apprehend that, if our energies are no best resonating, any above activity of accurateness usually evaporates – and if we added don’t apprehend that this “changing of partners” is apocalyptic of something absolute in us, i.e., our claimed growth.)
Over time and through again seeing a amount of this blazon of relationship, I came to apprehend that these relationships that are based on the partners’ inauthentic accepting resonating are what I now alarm acquirements relationships. In added words, we generally access into some relationships primarily to apprentice and abound by alive on our inauthentic stuff, and this purpose of acquirements tends to be the primary raison d’être for this blazon of relationship. This is acclaimed from the body acquaintance or accomplice accord in which we may be aesthetic anniversary other’s growth, but it’s not the sole purpose for the relationship.
The absolute aspect of acquirements relationships is that they are generally a admirable agitator for our growth. Anniversary acquirements accord tends to be centered about healing or adjustment one or added aspects of our stuff. Put addition way, “Each accord nurtures a backbone or weakness aural you” (Mike Murdock). And, usually, until we plan on whatever the accord is aggravating to advise us and we “get” it, we are bedevilled to accumulate repeating the lesson; that is, we can accept a arrangement of serially entering into agnate relationships. Recognizing that we accept a arrangement in relationships can accord us the key to acumen that there is something in ourselves to plan on. “To accept is to apperceive patterns,” Isaiah Berlin wrote – including our own patterns.
If, instead, we don’t admit that there is something to plan on in ourselves we may break ashore in the arrangement for a added abiding aeon of time. Generally we will again activity our dejection and accusation evidently and abuse all men or all women as accepting “worthless,” “unavailable,” etc. – until we apprentice to figuratively point that feel aback arise ourselves and attending aural to see what we charge to plan on or change in ourselves. “Everything that irritates us about others can advance us to an compassionate of ourselves” (Jung). Or, as Molière wrote, “One should appraise oneself for a continued time afore cerebration of accusatory others.”
A aberration on this affair of bump and accusation centers about those humans who are “rescuers.” Rescuers (not an aspect type) are generally benevolent humans who are perpetually aggravating to advice and accomplishment others, sometimes to the admeasurement that they in fact accept that that is one of their purposes in life. As with those who activity their own accepting evidently and accusation others and things alfresco of themselves, rescuers generally charge to figuratively point their fingers aback at themselves and attending aural for what they charge to accomplishment in themselves. A arrangement of defective to accomplishment others generally serves to avert one’s absorption from his/her own accepting and what he/she needs to plan on aural him/herself. As Aldous Huxley wrote, “There is alone one bend of the cosmos you can be assertive of convalescent and that’s your own self.”
Learning relationships, abnormally those that appoint us emotionally in an acute manner, are a able apparatus by which we can evolve, as we are angry added – through the ability of affect – by these generally difficult and/or aching accord experiences. I myself acquired a above assignment in self-esteem through a accord that was abortive and absolutely difficult. However, the assignment was acutely admired and was assuredly acquired – and, indeed, may accept been all the added assuredly categorical in me due to the admeasurement of the adversity and affecting attempt I went through.
What we angle to accretion from relationships such as these will alter from one accepting to the next and can run the area from acquirements self-esteem, to acceptable beneath acquiescent and dependent, to acquirements to be added emotionally available, to accepting added caring, to accepting beneath egoistic – or even to acceptable added acute about relationships. The acquaint can be absolutely diverse. However, one affair active through these acquirements relationships is that the cosmos is cartoon absorption to our inauthentic “stuff” that keeps us from accepting who we absolutely are and is allurement us to plan on it. Not everyone, of course, will plan on all, or even any, of his/her accepting in a lifetime because that may absolutely be, as ahead mentioned, what we are to acquaintance in that lifetime – never accepting aback to our authentic aspect (and, aswell as ahead mentioned, not anybody will accept abundant inauthentic accepting to plan on or clear).
Interestingly, I’ve apparent addition apparatus by which these acquirements relationships accomplish and that has to do with addition agency that induces the two humans to be calm in a relationship, added than just the resonance of the inauthentic stuff. This agency will generally apparent itself as a “pull” amid the two people. This cull is generally accomplished as a animal attraction, but may aswell be accomplished as a brainy or analytic pull: they are just fatigued to the added accepting for some acumen and can’t get that accepting out of his/her mind; or they are always aggravating to amount the added accepting out. (And, yes, this can advance to obsession.)
What I accept frequently apparent that I acquisition alluring is that generally if the assignment that was a above raison d’être for the accord is assuredly learned, the cull amid the two of them – animal attraction, brainy conundrum, obsession, or whatever – just disappears as if by magic. I attention this “pull,” about it is bidding and experienced, as a accessory acclimated by the cosmos to get us to apprentice a assignment (by accepting us into the accord that will advise us the lesson). Such an absorbing and artistic device!

How does the fastest, most powerful Ferrari V-8 in history sound? Better than the soft-spoken 488 GTB, that's for sure.

The supercar universe is beginning to resemble Marvel’s, with so many awesome, avenging members that the road—or the big screen—can hardly contain them. With its signature green skin and bellowing V-10, Low Ox Top Women’s chili Blue Sneakers 549611f Red Converse Dainty Paste gU6xw5tt is surely the automotive version of the Incredible Hulk. With apologies to the Audi R8 and its movie tie-ins, there's no way Tony Stark—a.k.a. Iron Man—couldn't resist upgrading to a McLaren 720S; that super-suit of a car bristles with so much weapons-grade technology that the mortal inside can’t help but feel arrogantly superior. The Chevy Corvette ZR1 is Captain America, obviously—the humble-roots underdog who can still kick your ass with patriotic spirit and ingenuity.
And the Ferrari 488 Pista? I’ll go with Spider-Man, as like Peter Parker after the arachnid bite, the high-performance version of the 488 GTB seems both a freak of nature and a creature of destiny. It’s super-powered, sure, but also fearlessly gymnastic, graceful, and oh-so-sticky. And it looks great in red and blue.
The Ferrari spun me into its seductive web in Italy, where I lapped the Pista at the company’s legendary Fiorano test circuit then pushed it nearly as hard in the Emilia-Romagna countryside, where this hopped-up 488 delivered as much pure, soulful entertainment as any car I’ve recently driven. As the successor to a long line of mid-engine “Special Series” Ferraris—including the most-recent one, the 458 Speciale—the 488 Pista has big shoes to fill. To fill those loafers to bursting, the Pista brings the biggest power gains, and the most intensive transfer of Ferrari racing technology, of any Special Series model yet.
First, this is the strongest eight-cylinder Ferrari to ever rocket out of a showroom, with 710 horsepower and 568 pound-feet of torque from just 3.9 liters of twin-turbo V-8. That’s a 49-horsepower jump from the standard 488, with seven additional pound-feet to boot. Coincidentally or not, the Pista precisely matches the horsepower and torque of the McLaren 720S, with its barely-larger, 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8. Curb weights also seem a toss-up: The Pista shaves 200 pounds from the already-svelte 488 GTB, resulting in a claimed dry weight of just 2,816 pounds. If that number is accurate, that’s 13 fewer pounds than McLaren’s carbon-fiber-intensive 720S. In fluid-filled form, the Ferrari weighs 3,047 pounds at the curb: 106 fewer pounds than a Porsche 911 GT3 RS, about 250 fewer than Lambo’s Performante—which admittedly has AWD, versus the Ferrari’s rear drive—and about 550 less than a Corvette ZR1.
The resulting supercar is a track-day showboat and a license-shredder on the street: Ferrari claims 0-62 miles per hour (100 kph) in a seemingly-conservative 2.85 seconds. I suspect enterprising testers will achieve the shorter 0-60 mph run in 2.7 seconds, maybe less. The 0-124 mph sprint (200 kph) takes a ridiculous 7.6 seconds. That’s 0.7 seconds quicker than the old 458 Speciale—the latter one of the best, most-beloved sports cars I’ve ever driven. Top speed rises to 211 mph, up from about 206 in the standard 488.
The private road course of Fiorano offers firsthand evidence as to what this latest berlinetta can do. I’m quickly reacquainted with Ferrari head test driver and engineer Raffaela De Simone, who takes me out for a few smoking laps before turning me loose on my own. The old 458 Speciale circled Fiorano in as little as 1 minute and 23.5 seconds; in pro hands, the 488 Pista is two seconds faster, at 1:21.5, a time which also makes it 1.5 seconds quicker than a standard 488.
Only two production Ferraris have lapped Fiorano in less time than the Pista. One is the hardcore, 770-hp F12 tdf, with a half-second edge over the Pista. The other, in a lap record set by De Simone himself, is the LaFerrari, in 1:19.7. That bears repeating: This Pista, starting from $345,300, gives up just 1.8 seconds per lap to Ferrari’s $1.4-million, 949-hp hypercar.
So, yeah, it’s fast. From its aerodynamic snout to its engine-breathing stern, the Pista takes copious lessons from Ferrari Challenge race cars and the 488 GT3s that have dominated the FIA World Endurance Championships, including two consecutive GT Manufacturer’s titles. Those bona fides are on lavish display at Fiorano, right down to red four-point seat belts that are optional for European buyers, but don’t conform to U.S. regulations. No loss there, unless you enjoy wriggling into and out of racing harnesses every time you stop for fuel or a snack. (Naturally, track-going Americans can still outfit the car with full five-point aftermarket racing belts).
Style Loafer Driving Women's Rose Taryn Kristine Suede Cobalt Silky But once I strapped in, the Pista’s point was clear: This supercar drives like a street-legal Challenge racer—minus the racing slicks and massive rear wing, and with a livable ride and sharper steering feel.
Engineers trimmed 40 pounds from the engine alone, and 50 percent of its parts are new. Turbocharger speed sensors on each cylinder bank, mated to the standard 488’s TIAL (titanium/aluminum alloy) turbine wheels, measure boost in real time to maximize power regardless of altitude or ambient temperature. Intake plenums are carbon fiber; compared with the 488, the engine gulps air that’s nearly 15 degrees Celsius cooler. An increased “tumble level” inside the cylinders allows that big, 49-horsepower jump with no engine knock. Connecting rods are pricey titanium, as in Ferrari's F1 cars, while the new exhaust manifold is formed from Inconel alloy. Its ultra-thin design—about 1 mm wide at its slimmest points, versus 3-4 mm for the standard 488—saves nearly 20 pounds, reduces engine back pressure and pumping losses, and contributes to a Pista priority: Improved engine and exhaust sound versus the tepid, strangled-goose mating call of the standard 488. Engineers say the Pista allows up to eight decibels more Italian-tuned glory into the cabin.
“That was a big challenge. We wanted to dramatically change and increase the sound,” one engineer tells me. It worked. This turbocharged Ferrari may not shriek to 9,000 rpm like its predecessors, but the trip to 8,000 rpm is now a ripping, sonorous delight. There’s more “color” to that roar as well, as measured by test graphs that show a visual increase in richer, more-pleasing frequencies. That level of sound is higher and better in every gear, at any engine speed, aided by new exhaust-bypass logic.
A subtle reworking of the glamorous cockpit includes a slathering of Alcantara and carbon-fiber and the elimination of the glovebox from a 488 that was already shy on storage space. A carbon-fiber console places the 488’s three transmission buttons—one of which is launch control—on a striking, curved arm that recalls Batman's batarang. (Hey, DC fans deserve a shout-out too).
Aerodynamics and attendant cooling deserve their own dissertation. “Virtual fairing” of the exposed front tires trims drag by 7 percent, and the car enjoys a 20-percent gain in aero efficiency overall, including 500 pounds of downforce at 124 mph. The Pista’s center stripes—which create the striking two-tone livery, and come in subtle variations of color and pattern—pour down the hood into the race-bred “S-Duct,” another Ferrari showroom first. The striking duct channels air through the front fascia and over the hood to generate front-axle downforce. Indeed, the Pista’s front end is entirely new, including a larger-volume fascia, splitter flicks, and a carbon-fiber hood. Front diffusers vent and accelerate air into the wheel arches, creating suction and downforce.
Among the many tech carryovers from Challenge racing, the front radiators are inverted and canted rearward to direct hot air along the underbody, but well away from side intercooler intakes. In another Challenge-inspired move, the engine intakes move to the car’s rear, to take advantage of that higher-pressure area; the 488’s signature swoopy cleavages aft of the doors are now strictly tasked with feeding the turbo intercoolers and cooling the engine bay. Bordeaux Loafer Erica Women's Slip FRYE Venetian On nPzwZYnxq7, the rear diffuser incorporates three active flaps that can rotate up to 14 degrees to stall the diffuser and minimize drag, up to that 211-mph top speed. The Pista’s dolphin-tail spoiler grows 30 mm higher and 40 mm longer, and now angles slightly upward for added downforce.
The result is a new definition of insanity for a mid-engine V-8 Ferrari. On fantasy ascents and descents in Emilia-Romagna, the Ferrari accelerates so blindingly and connects corners so quickly that I'm forced to recalibrate my sense of relative distance and time. The Pista becomes a deus ex machina version of Mikaele Shiffrin, blowing through slalom gates at downhill speed.
But there's more to this F-car than just its forward pace. Modern Ferraris have become so fast that people tend to overlook how brilliantly they steer, even as hydraulic steering has given way to electric assist. For the Pista’s electrified unit, every fraction of steering input translates to immediate, thrilling action. And while the car’s magnetic-damper suspension is fairly stiff, including spring rates about eight percent firmer than the 488 GTB, the car never feels lumpy or hectic. It's just perfectly dialed-in.
After benchmarking competitors in full-throttle acceleration tests from 2,000 rpm in third gear, Ferrari cites data—and underlines it with real pride—showing that its turbocharged engine produces measurably less lag than any forced-induction rival. (That goes for its application in the Ferrari Portofino convertible, as well). By design, the sound, torque, and acceleration build in concert to the peak of the rev range, mimicking the sensation of naturally aspirated power. And maximum horsepower is on tap everywhere from 6,750 rpm to 8,000 rpm, encouraging regular climbs to those Italian summits.
I definitely achieve my share of maximum horsepower in the Pista, aided by, yes, another new tech bit: The Ferrari Dynamic Enhancer builds on such F1-developed traction strategies as Side Slip Control (now on version 6.0), but with a twist—the system provides high-level oversteer management only when traction control is shut down completely in “CT Off” mode. Yippie-ki-yay, indeed. Software and a new actuation system estimate lateral handling variables throughout each corner, and can trigger individual brake pressure to control the “evolution” of side slip. The idea is to eliminate traction oversight (meaning power reductions) for drivers who can handle it, and help them to push the car’s limits—or enjoy lengthy bouts of oversteer—with fewer steering-wheel or throttle adjustments. We assembled journalists like to pounce on the brake-intervention philosophy, but Ferrari insists this isn’t a traditional stability control system. On a few lonely curves and roundabouts, I find it’s a breeze to keep my foot down, light the Ferrari’s 20-inch tires, and drift smoothly toward the exit with just a souçon of countersteer. Should I credit the Dynamic Enhancer? Who knows? But it feels good.
Loafer Silky Rose Suede Kristine Taryn Driving Style Cobalt Women's So good, in fact, that I end up driving the Ferrari for a solid hour in that CT Off mode. I tease out wheelspin from standing starts and upshifts, enjoy some wrenching semi-automated launches, and marvel at how quickly I can drive this Ferrari without my personal danger-radar going off. (Back in America, police radar will be a bigger worry).
Naturally, Michelin developed a unique version of its Pilot Sport Cup 2 tire designated “K2” for the Pista, a tire that boosts dry- and wet-weather grip even as rolling resistance drops by eight percent to save fuel. This 488's diet culminates with spectacular carbon-fiber wheels that weigh 40 percent less than standard 488 rims. Those optional wheels will add about €15,000 to Euro-market models, or $17,700 at current exchange rates, though U.S. pricing for the wheels isn’t set. Considering what supercar buyers shell out for thin, purely-cosmetic carbon-fiber trim bits, a set of highly-engineered, aerospace-coated carbon wheels for around 18 grand actually sounds like a fair deal.
The heightened aggression continues with the Pista’s seven-speed, dual-clutch automated gearbox. Its revised shift cuts gear-change times by 30 milliseconds when the steering wheel manettino switch is in the “Race” position. And the Ferrari racing hand-me-downs peak with the new “wall effect” rev limiter. Traditional electronic limiters, Ferrari says, must predict redline’s arrival and begin to cut fuel well before the engine actually gets there. In the Pista, there’s no such drop in power and loss of momentum. Instead of banging into the rev limiter with that familiar bap-bap-bapMarianne Women's Naturalizer Silver Marianne Women's Naturalizer Sneaker zw1qwdg sound—a dispiriting thrustus interruptus—the Ferrari continues to supply fuel and accelerate as it broaches the engine’s peak. The propulsive effect proves addictive: On long sweepers in these sun-kissed hillsides, I keep my foot pinned, delay the paddle upshift for a few thrilling beats, and feel the Pista surge and snarl at the literal height of its powers. And because this engine revs so quickly, I’m grateful for Ferrari’s signature cascade of shift lights on the steering wheel.
On public roads, some owners may find shift quality in Race mode to be too brutal, a repeated back slap from an Italian strongman. So when you feel like taking things down a notch, the Ferrari shifts just fine in its Sport setting, or even in full automatic mode. Still, the Pista’s fully-tensed personality and performance is the real reason to buy one, or to upgrade from a civilian-issue 488. Ferrari expects a remarkable 90 percent of U.S. buyers to be current Ferrari owners, more than in any other country.
Supercars and superhero movies are alike in another way: Neither would exist without big budgets and cost overruns. The 488 Pista's $345,300 base price represents a hulking $92,000 premium over a standard 488 GTB. Two track specials down, one to go: With Ferrari and Lamborghini having served up their respective Pista and Performante, the ball blazes into McLaren’s court. Will the upcoming Long Tail version of the 720S one-up Ferrari, Lamborghini, or both? Does it matter? That LT will surely deliver its share of British bragging points—including a superior power-to-weight ratio—over its Italian rivals. (Here’s hoping that ride quality is improved over the previous 675LT, whose body-taxing manners made it a dubious proposition as a daily driver).
But the real takeaway is that supercar fans, like superhero geeks, are living in a Golden Age of options and over-stimulation. Whatever cut of cape you prefer, your supercar will blow mortals’ minds, save the universe, and still leave time for a clever quip before it belts into the stratosphere.

I made a mistake of having sex with a call girl. She put condom on my penis and gave me oral and then we had 3-4 min vaginal sex. Then I started feeling guilty and said no more. she had fingered herself a bit to make me enter her easily. then she asked me that she will me a handjob without condom. she then gave me a handjob without condom. I am super tensed of the whole situation. For the alst week, I have been having diarrohea, very itchy skin, lost my appetite and some rashes. also i feel a bit of higher than normal temperature. i completed 2 weeks today and I am dying here with tension. i can't even do my office work.. i have been asked to wait for a week or 2 to get tested. Please help me.
Since you have described multiple activities, I am going to break them down one by one in terms of risk level:
1) Receiving oral sex is considered a negligible risk activity. This means that while it is theoretically possible to acquire HIV in this scenario, there has never been a confirmed report.
2) Protected vaginal sex is considered a low risk activity. This means that there have been a few reports of infection attributed to this activity, but usually under certain identifiable conditions (i.e. the condom breaking).
3) Receiving a hand job, which is known as "non-insertive masturbation", is considered a no risk activity.
Thus, out of the three things that you described, your activities vary from no risk to low risk. That being said, the correct use of a condom greatly reduces this risk as it acts as a barrier against the transmission of bodily fluids, which is how HIV is transmitted from person to person.
In terms of your symptoms: there are no specific symptoms of HIV. In fact, certain individuals may never develop symptoms, and for those who do, most symptoms will go away after a few days, or at most, a couple of weeks. This is why the only way to diagnose HIV is to get tested. Because HIV symptoms mirror so many other viral infections or can be explained by other things, we do not go by symptoms here at AIDS Vancouver.
Whether or not you want to get tested is your decision, and there are a variety of HIV tests available worldwide. The 4th Generation HIV test, also known as the "Combo" test or the "Duo" test, is an effective and reliable option. It is known as the "Duo" test because not only does it test for the presence of HIV antigens in your body, but it also tests for your body's production of HIV antibodies; hence its effectiveness. It would be a good idea to consult with your local health care practitioner if you want to consider HIV testing. However, keep in mind that your risk level is low, and that the correct use of an unbroken condom greatly lowers that risk.
Avert and CATIE are two fantastic and reliable website concerning HIV transmission and testing, and I highly encourage you to take a read through if you have any further questions.
Yesterday I interrupted a fight and got in contact with a man whose nose started bleeding. I handed him a tissue and tried not to get in contact with the blood but a few minutes later I realised I had a blood stain on my shirt as well as a few splatters on my arm, hand and face. (the splatters on my face were very small like two millimetres). I washed my face and hands, but I'm a little bit hypochondriac and now I'm scared there might have been a risk of transmission.

I am posting here because I have lost my peace of mind since last week and am facing contradictory opinions in various forums. Please help me out. So a few days ago I went for a shave in a nearby salon. I am from India, the salons here not very clean but this one was okay. Now every time I go for a shave I check if the barber if using news blades, I forgot that day. He started shaving and felt slight pain on my partially popped pimple. He then opened the drawer and brought out a new blade (He was using a straight razor). I asked him if he had been shaving me so far with an old blade. He said NO. But I am not convinced. After I went home I noticed that there was a red scratch around my neck and the partially popped pimples. There was no visible blood but still I felt sick to my stomach thinking about this. Now assuming the person who shaved before me was HIV+ and his infected blood came in contact with the blade with which I was later shaved I have the following questions -
1) I was given a shave approximately 40/50 seconds after the earlier guy. Does HIV survive for 1 minute in open air? I didn't notice if the earlier blade was in open air, kept in a jar of water (Which I think was not), or washed. In that case does HIV virus go away after a wash and does it survive if kept in a small jar of water.
2) There was no visible blood on my face except for some red scratches around my neck and partially popped pimples. The thing that I am worried about is the fact that may be the cut was so small that i didn't notice/see. I washed my face and re examined it after 1 hour but found to traces of blood/cut except for those red scratches I mentioned earlier. I am worried that may be the cut disappeared within this 1 hour because I thoroughly washed my face.
3) The next day I popped open my partially popped pimple to see if there was blood and found some puss and some red material, which looks like blood. Will this action of mine pose a problem?
Please help me out. I am student and have mane entrance exams in the next month. I am loosing sleep over this issue and can't study. I am constantly thinking that my life has been cut short due to my stupidity. I am in extreme mental anguish. Please answer my queries ASAP. Thank You.
Recently I was needing to shave my beard and I pulled a razor out from my drawer in my bathroom. During shaving, I accidentally nicked myself a few times, and I didn't think about it much at first. However, I had my brother over a few days ago and I found out he may have used one of the razors from the same drawer to shave. I don't personally know his HIV status, but say if he were to have HIV, used this blade, accidentally cut himself, stupidly put the blade back, and I had used it and nicked myself, what would be the chance of me contracting HIV (or any STDs in general, for that matter)? I know I sound paranoid, but I'm losing sleep over it and would like to know what my risk is. If I'm not at risk, then what makes this a different and lower risk than "sharing needles"? Any help is appreciated. Thank you.
I had an encounter with a gentleman with whom we discussed his status and mine (both negative) and I pick at my thumbs, but had a band aid over it. During lunch, the band aid came off, and after, we made out in the car and I touched his penis and may have gotten precum on my thumb, then he did do filatio to me, but did not for long. I got test tested with the 4th generation test 8 weeks and 1 day after to which it came back negative. What is the likelihood of HIV transmitting, and should I get tested again?
Hello I am a transgender who has not been sexually active. Well I met someone one craigslist late at night and acted a little dumb. Now I am just wanting reassurance if I should be worried or not. I don't know the man just met him once he was nice. We met in my car and talked for awhile and I ended up giving him a hand job, while I was doing that to him he played with my anus a little fingered it some but really didn't really stick it in very much if he did he stuck it in pretty shallow but played with it enough to that it hurt for a few days. Before he was able to cum I got scared and stopped but I did have a lot of precum on my hands. He was cool with me stopping and he left and that was all. I also do test my sugar with my hands but that was more than 12 hours before. Should I be worried about any std especially HIV giving him that hand jog or him fingering my anus a little? We did not kiss on the mouths at all or do anything else. No sex was involved in anyway just a handjob and my anus being fingered a little. Please help this transgender calm down.
I was fingered by a guy who had some pre-cum on his fingers. What are the risks of getting hiv from this kind of activity? Thank you.
I'm looking for some advice about an encounter I had with another male. It's the only sexual experience I've had with another male. The other guy claims he has only ever had oral with another male and advised me he was free from any form of std. Apart from what they said I don't know their sexual health history.
During our meet the other guy had his foreskin over the head of my penis, I played with his penis until he ejaculated while his foreskin was still over my penis, so the head of my penis (possibly inside it too) was covered in the guys ejaculate. I removed my penis for a minute then we 'docked' again until I ejaculated.
I have to admit I enjoyed the experience but do wish it was with someone I knew rather than a random guy I know nothing about.
Would it be possible to find out what the possibilities of hiv transmission if the other male was infected? Or other std's that may have been present?
i didnt insert into her , i only recieved blowjob , i fingered her in he back bottom , there was alot of surface contacts without condum and without insertion ( vagainal surface contacts without insertion ) .. alot of kisses and hugs and i recieved oral sex for more than 20 minutes ...
yesterday i tested hiv i&ii Ag&Ab and teh result came negative ( this was after 63 days from the exposure and i dont know if it is 4th generation or not )
I need your help and guidance. I am a gay guy and last week, I met a guy where we had some fun. It was mainly deep kissing, genital rubbing, body play and he sucked me for maximum 5-7 sec because I am not into it. After that I asked him not to do it and we kissed and made body love (there was no anal sex). I don't know his HIV status though he said he is clean. I met him today again(only met) where he said that he is clean and i should not be worried about it. I am feeling itchy skin though with a few pimples. Is there any concern for me and should I get tested for this? I am very much freaking out now. Need your guidance.
I was playing with a women, I touched and fingered her vagina. I did not have any wounds on my hands. after a couple of minutes i touched my penis.

London, Mar. 29 (ANI): Brushing aside the Scotland Yard probe into his inflammatory speeches, the controversial Muslim cleric Anjem Choudary has warned that Britain would become a Sharia state soon.
Let me tell you something the Sharia will be implemented in Pakistan, it will be implemented in India and Bangladesh and even down the road in Downing Street. There is nothing to stop me calling for a Sharia state, the Sunday Express quoted Choudary, as telling his followers in London.
The London-born lawyer, who in his youth was a cider-drinking ladies man, further said that Muslims around the world would rise and eventually conquer the White House.
People said look at that man building that boat in the mountain. Now they say look at that lunatic calling for the Sharia in Britain they say the same thing, he said in a voice rising with passion and vigor.
President Nixon once said if the Muslims in the Asian continent gathered together they would be a superpower. There are more than one billion in the Indian sub-continent … if they woke up, he said.
Scotland Yard reportedly is investigating him for allegedly saying homosexuals should be stoned to death.
That allegation about stoning is not true and I am complaining to the Press Complaints Commission. It is all fabrication. If I was supporting terrorists, do you think I would be here, and I would have a beard, he said.
Tory MP and homeland security expert Patrick Mercer called for Scotland Yard to look at Choudarys latest speech too.
His comments sound like sedition to me. The police should look very carefully at his words to see if he has broken the law. Victims of the 7/7 bombing will, I am sure, be hugely upset by what sounds like sedition, he said. (ANI)
Once again superb work by Pat Condell-the man who should be in the media rather than the highly PC ones we have now.
One of Condell's points was that Choudary was making comments that a non-Muslim would have been arrested for. Judging by some of the threads that are posted about Britain -- it would seem to be a true statement.
“The truth, of course, is that a billion falsehoods told a billion times by a billion people are still false.”
" I fail to understand a God whose main job has been to pimp for a man....." WTF I bet there is a lot of other stuff about life and the world that you don't understand Richard Cranium.
People who are stupid enough to vote for the muslim brotherhood do not deserve freedom. America is a Dhimmi nation. He is definitely right on those two points. My goodness, America has elected a muslim president.
To give Obama the benefit of the doubt about being Christian is just plain silly. Condell is wrong there. Obama is muslim.
This persecution is going on for quite a long time. I am not going back as far as time of Omar the idiot.I am specifically talking about post colonial, post cold war and later period.
No American president whether he was Republican or Democrat ever raised the issue. No one ever even used the word "christian' when talking about this persecution. American presidents were busy kissing Arab rears for barrel of oil, whether they were Dhimmis, Muslim or cold war warriors like Reagan. With US establishment its considred uncouth to even mention word "Christian" when they talk about opressed christians of Egypt or Sudan or for that matter anywhere in the world.
All perfectly true, but it does not excuse the amateur that is in the White House now, and will not excuse any future American president. It does not excuse the gutless European powers that be either.
Once again this guy gets the mood of many. We have had enough of the screaming and killing. We will never respect Islam. We have read the books and see the behavior.
If by now you have not known about this remarkable Englishman, who tells Muslims the naked truth about their religion. then you are missing a great deal of fun.

Southwest LRT will help ease the mismatch between urban job seekers and metro jobs: Growth and Justice
Look closely at the orange and green splotches on new mapping of the Twin Cities metropolitan area, and you’ll begin to understand why building the Southwest Light Rail Transit line (SWLRT) has become so important in special session negotiations, for both Minnesota business leaders and advocates for economic and racial justice.
Orange blobs on these maps represent the largest concentrations of metro job vacancies, while the green blobs mark the greatest densities of underemployed job seekers. Connecting those needy blobs — workers in need and employers in need — should be a driving force in transportation policy. And the dotted line to the southwest, representing the proposed SWLRT, comes close to connecting two of the largest orange and green blobs.
Those maps and an abundance of other current data and advice for transit and workforce development are part of an impressive report that was released toward the end of the regular session by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Transportation Studies. A distinguished U of M associate professor in transportation policy, Yingling Fan, is the lead author.
The report — Linking the Unemployed to Jobs: Integrated Transit Planning and Workforce Development — provides a strong foundation of support for two fairly straightforward propositions.
One, we do need aggressive investment and a build-out of both commuter rail and other transit options, to help alleviate both an emerging labor shortage and to address mounting concerns about racial equity and widening disparities in workforce and economic outcomes.
Two, transit development really must be more closely coordinated with workforce training and workforce development policies. Underskilled and underemployed young adults of color living on the north side, for instance, should be nudged more specifically into fast-track Career Pathway training for the specific kinds of jobs opening up in the suburbs, to which a transit build-out will provide quicker access.
A summary article about the report in a recent edition of Catalyst, the CTS newsletter, puts it this way: “Unemployed transit-dependent workers are often caught between a rock and a hard place: they may be qualified for suburban jobs they have no way to get to, but unqualified for downtown jobs they could easily reach by transit.”
The mismatch has worsened in the Twin Cities over the last 15 years, according to the maps in the report, and Fan nails the problem with this statement in the newsletter: “The biggest concentrations of unemployed workers lack frequent transit service to some of the richest concentrations of job vacancies, particularly jobs in the south and southwest metro.’’
The CTS report offers new and detailed data and analysis about the exact kinds and quantity of job vacancies by location, and it should serve as a valuable resource for economic development planners and workforce experts throughout the Twin Cities.
Consider the entire gamut of factors linking workers with jobs: individuals’ skills and interests, available training, jobs reachable by transit, and interested employers.
Collect data on job seekers’ skills to help determine focus for training programs, and tailor those programs to participants’ capabilities and needs.
Identify employers who stand to benefit from engaging with workforce development and transit planning efforts. The employers may include those facing labor supply problems in inaccessible suburban locations.
Redefine flexible transportation to take into account disadvantaged workers’ often complex lives and nontraditional schedules. Serving disadvantaged workers well with transit will mean fast, frequent, regular regional service and local connections tailored to demand.
Pursue diverse first-mile/last-mile solutions to connect workplaces with transit lines. Engage transportation management organizations and also consider employer or district shuttles and car or bicycle sharing.
Minnesota’s top business leaders generally embrace these findings. And so it’s difficult to understand why the House Republican majority isn’t more impressed by an unequivocal statement of support by leading corporate CEOs for SWLRT, in an op-ed that ran in the Star Tribune toward the end of the regular session. Business owners and managers traditionally constitute perhaps the most important base of support for conservative and Republican policies and candidates.
In that op-ed, written by three CEOs and co-signed by nine others, this futuristic statement and warning leaps out:
Estimates show that our region will add around 750,000 people over the next 25 years. Many will be the younger workers all businesses are looking to attract. And they are driving less and choosing transit more frequently. A Rockefeller survey showed that young workers consider transit to be a quality-of-life factor that draws them to a region to live or work. Gone are the days of moving to a city or region because of work; today’s young workers choose first where they want to live, and then seek a job in that location.
And more to the point of immediate equity and connecting suburban jobs with urban job seekers, the CEOs said:
These (SWLRT and other planned rail and rapid bus routes) are transit lines that travel through some of the densest areas of the region, rich with current and future jobs. The planned lines would put 500,000 more people within a 30-minute commute from work. They would provide a faster, more reliable option for workers who don’t want to sit in traffic on a snowy day or don’t want to buy a car to live and work here.
Meanwhile, despite some dissent from some progressives in recent years, equity advocates in the Twin Cities and statewide also generally align in strong support for full-speed ahead on SWLRT and other transit projects. Among the more assertive champions of an equitable light-rail buildout is the Alliance for Metropolitan Stability, a coalition of grass-roots organizations that advances racial, economic and environmental justice in growth and development patterns in the Twin Cities region.
The AMS is working closely with an alliance of neighborhood groups to ensure that the SWLRT and other transit projects live up to their promise and do the many little things that help truly connect disadvantaged populations to better jobs and to serve other needs related to equity.
Numerous and voluminous national reports show how transit and light-rail development serve the cause of equity, from minority hiring in construction and operation of the projects to their obvious value in affordability and connectivity for low-income riders.
The National Center for Social Inclusion (NCSI), on a webpage headlined Access to Public Transit Is a Matter of Racial Equity, offers statistics that reflect findings in the U of M study. The NCSI estimates that “Black people are six times more likely and Latinos three times more likely than White people to rely on public transit. And to compound matters, in the last decade, the proximity of job centers to high-poverty communities has declined by 61 percent, which means that people of color are increasingly disconnected from their jobs.’’
The disconnect and the mismatch are among Minnesota’s most important problems and they represent a clear and present threat to our continued prosperity and equity. If our communities of color, top business leaders, and our leading academic experts are all on the same train, it might just be advisable to climb aboard.

Imam Ali (as) said: “He is from the Hashemites; the top of the mountain of the Arabs (the best of the Arabs), the sea, to which everyone comes ladling, the safe resort and the pure spring when others become turbid. He is from the people, who do not cower when death hastens, do not weaken when the end approaches and do not recede when the heroes clash. He is always a winner like a lion. He will do away with the oppressors and the arrogants. He is a sword of Allah’s. He arises from loftiness. His glory emits from a great glorious family. Let none of those, who hasten towards seditions and who when saying, the evilest of sayers and when keeping silent, fishing in the troubled water, prevents you from paying homage to him.”

So you’ve decided to attend Lollapalooza 2018. Congratulations! You have made a smart investment in your musical future. At four days and 170+ artists however, there’s a whole lot to digest. You can’t see and do everything no matter how hard you try, so choices need to be made. Some choices are easier than others, but if you’re looking for a bit of guidance, allow me to play Pied Piper and point you in the direction of some bands and artists to see over the course of the weekend. Part of the goal here is to point out some lesser known or up-and-coming artists you might not be familiar with yet, but who are worth the effort to try and see (even if they perform early in the day). There are a few veterans sprinkled in for good measure as well, but no headliners because you can presumably figure those out on your own. Five recommendations per day with minimal time conflicts between them, so if you hustle around Grant Park here are 20 performances that will turn your festival experience from good to great. Join me after the jump and we’ll get started!

The weather was top of mind heading into this Pitchfork Music Festival weekend, primarily because the forecast predicted scattered thunderstorms all three days. Prepared to go with the flow whatever that might wind up being, I arrived at Union Park on Friday armed with a poncho, umbrella, and plastic bags for my cell phone, wallet, and camera if needed. It began to rain as I approached the entrance gate, so the poncho became a fashion accessory immediately. Undeterred by the showers, I wandered a short distance to the Red stage, where the ferocity of Melkbelly‘s guitars made for a rather appropriate weather soundtrack. They’re Chicagoans, so they fully understand how everything from temperature to precipitation can turn on a dime in this city. And turn it did, because not only did the rain stop after about 15 minutes, but the sun was shining by the end of Melkbelly’s set. It almost felt like a weird bit of coordination, as the band’s performance only got stronger, louder, and heavier as the weather got better. Did they scare the clouds away? When your show has such a high level of intensity, anything seems possible. They set the bar high right at the start of the day, and woe to whatever artist had to follow them.
The artist that followed them was Lucy Dacus. Even though she was coming in hot off her magnificent new record Historian, pretty much anything she did would be viewed as a slight letdown compared to what Melkbelly had just done. The good news is that Dacus didn’t attempt to be anything other than her truest self on stage. As such, there wasn’t anything particularly flashy or gimmicky in her performance, just some rock-solid songs and some good interplay with her band members. After spotting a few ominous-looking clouds in the distance after her first couple of songs, she quickly called an audible and changed the set list on the fly “out of fear” the weather might force them to end early. “I’m also a little worried about the possibility of getting electrocuted,” Dacus confessed. She needn’t be concerned however, as the rain never came and she finished the set without any problems. It was my first Lucy Dacus live experience, and if I’m being honest it was perfectly lovely.

One of the best things about Friday at Pitchfork Music Festival every year is how relaxed the overall vibe is compared to the rest of the weekend. It’s less a product of the artists on the lineup and more the result of lower attendance (because many people are working), later arrivals (some show up after work), and people wanting to conserve their energy for the days ahead. You spend the day getting your bearings, learning where everything is located, and trying not to over-extend yourself. Yet it’s still a blast and the lineup is certainly nothing to sneeze at either. This year one of the biggest features of Pitchfork Fest is just how LOCAL it is. Yes, it’s very local every year, but that’s mostly reflected in the vendors and fun side attractions rather than the music itself. There are always a handful of Chicago artists and bands on the lineup, which has been nice but felt more like an afterthought than an actual intention. With 13 Chicago acts (out of 42 total) on the 2018 lineup, that’s no longer the case. Not only that, but the artists that were booked are all highly respected and critically acclaimed. If this is something Pitchfork hopes to continue in the future I worry they may run out of good choices, even though the local music scene is pretty massive. But we’ll take what we can get, and this year promises to be one of the best yet. There are five Chicago artists performing on Friday, including two bands that kick off the festival proper. Learn a bit more about all of them, and check out my personal picks for who to see hour-by-hour below.

Originally a drummer, Andres Loo is a musician, who does shows with his exclusive wave-edit based music, prototypically rhythm-focused, spiced up with heart ache vocals for cherries on the cake. Coming from Tallinn, Estonia, Loo has recently been warming up bands like Black Dice and writing film music for Estonian feature films. His upcoming collaborations include a musical, to be written alongside Kevin Blechdom. "Skeletons on Rock" (Laton 048) is the debut release by Andres Loo. Loo's sonic edge seems to be hijacked from the experimental, but don't let it deceive you... It is music. Poppy, occassionally extremist sounding powertunes, and a tease for music lovers of many kinds.

Two federal agencies are planning to collaborate in the next fiscal year to address long-term care workforce issues in nursing home settings, according to a report released Thursday.
The report, published by the Government Accountability Office, identified gaps and limitations in data about direct care workers, such as nursing assistants and home health aides, that hinder workforce planning efforts.
Among those gaps is a lack of data from the Department of Health and Human Services’ Health Resources and Services Administration on the supply and demand of the direct care workforce, the GAO said. HRSA has not produced an assessment of direct care worker data in more than 10 years, despite the creation of new data sources.

I’m so happy to say that I forgot yesterday was Cyber Monday. Thank you Glamis Sand Dunes. That’s pretty easy to do when instead of giving in to the commercialism of Christmas you are spending days and days outside completely unhooked from technology. And also completely covered in sand. Seriously a weekend spent in Glamis, California means you will more than likely end up with sand in your hair, in your eyes not to mention most of your other orifices.
Or maybe I forgot it was Cyber Monday because I was just distracted because I spent my Cyber Monday off-roading through sand dunes with Erik Estrada. I had learnt a little more about off-roading from reading reviews and tips on https://ravenoffroad.com and it sounds great fun! So, I decided to give it a go myself. But,
I have a confession to make. I’m a 37-year-old Californian who had never been to Glamis. Until Thanksgiving weekend 2017. This off-road destination out in the Imperial Desert might be familiar to all my friends , family and neighbors but in all my 37 years I had never ended up out past Ocotillo Wells at this off-roading mecca. Maybe that’s because I don’t own a sand rail bro!
But luckily our good friends Tom and Angie have lots of fun sand toys and don’t mind sharing them with their two crazy friends from Big Bear Lake. And that’s how we ended up driving four hours to camp amongst some big ass sand dunes, losing track of time, technology and spending a long weekend playing in the dunes, with our dogs and bar b qing good food, plus having way to many cocktails in the desert fifty miles to the north of the Mexican border and Mexicali.
Many adventures were had, many cocktails were consumed and we came away from our long weekend in Glamis with sand everywhere and tons of stories of the good times we had in the desert. We decided last minute to take our pups with us which is not exactly advisable in the Glamis as bros will just rip through your camp on their quads and dogs do get hit, but when we set us camp we set up all the RV’s and fifth wheels in a tight circle and the dogs had a great time in the sand.
Well, except maybe Mocha the Husky, who was trying to dig through the cool sand to make a den for herself and escape the 92 degree heat. Yes, that is 92 degrees in almost December. Yea for southern California. It would have been super pleasant if there had been a pool or any water to swim in anywhere near by (I mean besides the super stinky Salton Sea we drove by it on the drive in to Glamis) 92 degree heat in the middle of the day with no pool to swim in meant we had to hydrate with a few cocktails.
A weekend spent out in Glamis means a lot of time playing out in the sand in the Yamaha side by side or on the dirt bikes. It meant half day group rides enjoying that Glamis sunset from Oldsmobile Hill. It also meant as the newbie of the group sometimes being the ones left behind on the ride and being really great flu we had talkie talkies so we could call for back up.
And then our dog broke out of the RV and went walk-about in camp one night when we were on a very long group ride. As big of a pain in the ass as Carly is I didn’t really want to lose her in the desert. As we looked all over the RV, pondering, how the hell did she get out? A little girl came over with Carly on a leash. Hours later we made the discovery that when the fireworks started terrified Carly had jumped out of the RV window, yes like 8 feet to the sand below. Like I said, we are newbies at Glamis and we had no idea there would be fireworks and our little dog would have the crap scared out of her.
When Carly is not going walk-about she is driving around in the side by side with her BFF Mocha. And yes, Mocha is sporting the latest in Husky fashion, Doggoles. Even with the heat our dogs had a fantastic time out in the Glamis sands. Even our old bitch who is almost complexly deaf at this point (But still relatively fast and sneaky) and would try to wander of like an old man escaping the home any chance she could. Which was pretty much the only exercise I got for four days (Besides working out my liver) chasing Old Candy around our Glamis wagon wheel camp ground.
My boyfriend and I both agree that Glamis is not exactly our thing. Not enough pretty for us. We prefer taking the toys out on mountain trails where there are alpine meadows and sparkling lakes, but our weekend in Glamis was a fun adventure and something new, outside the box for us to try.
In the UK boxing day is the big sales day, we went for a walk, much better than hitting the shops 🙂 not quite as glam as hitting the dunes, but still much better than rampant commercialism

X-Nudism is the biggest Web portal containing materials intended for the surfers keen on nudist photos & nudist videos niche. X-Nudism project was started in 2001 and turned into one of most frequently visited resources dedicated to nude beach lifestyle almost at once. We've united many enthusiasts keen on shooting nudist pics and just having fun at nude beaches all over the world.
This time we took our model to an ordinary beach where people sunbath solely in their shorts and bikinis. That’s why her arrival was a real shock! This model’s name is Anna, she is 19 years old and she studies in one of the local universities. Anna took off her bikini with absolutely no shame and got settled to sunbathe naked. She was lying on the sand, swimming in the sea, walking by the water letting the sun caress the tenderest corners of her body... During the shoot a passer-by of about 25-28 years of age tried to get acquainted with Anna. She agreed to give him her phone number in case he got naked too. The guy said no. The reason why he did it was obvious - one could see the boner even underneath his baggy pants! So, get ready for the next shoot right off the nudist beach by X-Nudism!
Passers-by couldn’t stop looking at them even when we were still on our way to the beach! Can you imagine what happened to the sunbathers when our cuties got stripped in front of them? The girls were fully aware of the fact that all the attention was now turned to them - and they did their best to use it! There was a beach ball in our ride so the girls decided to play some nude volleyball. Hope you understand what stunning poses they were taking during the game… Is it worth mentioning that most of the men on the beach had to turn over and keep on watching lying on their bellies… :)
Deadlines do this to me, especially life-course-determining ones. Anxiety used to be my roommate. I kicked her out a while ago and changed the locks, but once in a while she slips in through an unlocked back door. That girl knows no boundaries, I tell ya!
In the middle of one of those days, I took my son and husband to the airport for college visits (landing in rush hour traffic both to and from Boston) and made it home in time to get my daughter to dance, throw a nicer shirt on, and attempt to manage back-to-school night at the high school jumping between the schedules of a freshman and a senior on a massive campus. It felt like an episode of a teen sitcom as I rushed around trying to slide into each class before the bell rang.
So it was in my great hurry to arrive at the last class that I cut a corner down a hallway, and, to my great surprise, there was a low-to-the-ground, black end table next to a couch in the loft area between halls. I imagine high school students gather and are aware of the furniture there—but not me. I was not aware. It simply was not in my line of vision. I had Algebra I, Part 2 (whatever that is) to get to, where my friend teaches the class. What a nice way to end the long day, except for this: Read the rest of this entry »

Then he talked again about the aspects of al-Mahdi (aj) by saying: “He is the most generous, the most aware and the kindest of you to his kin. O Allah, make his advent as deliverance from distresses and make the umma unite by him! O you man, if Allah chooses (that) to you, be determined and do not deviate from him (al-Mahdi) when you are guided to him.” He sighed and pointed at his chest with his hand showing his eagerness to see him.”1

Things really heat up in the summer with everything from large festivals, grassroots concerts and intimate performances in downtown establishments. This is your guide to Huntsville’s summer music scene…check it out and choose your next musical adventure!
The Huntsville Festival of the Arts is in its 26th season of bringing great music, art and culture to the community. What began in 1993 as a celebration of classical music has grown into a year-round festival featuring a jam-packed summer line-up. With an eclectic roster of performers representing a range of musical styles, there’s something for everyone to enjoy.
The Festival’s home base is the highly acclaimed Algonquin Theatre stage, but concerts are also hosted in several other local venues including Deerhurst Resort and the beautiful Huntsville Town Docks. The 2018 season features the amazing talents of the Jim Cuddy Band and Matt Anderson, returning favourites Whitehorse and a special appearance by Choir! Choir! Choir!
Want more jazz? Mark your calendar for August 2-4 when the Festival of the Arts presents the 9th annual Huntsville Jazz Festival. All weekend long the town will be swinging and jiving to live jazz performances at the Algonquin Theatre. On Thursday Micah Barnes transports audiences to the early 60s era of jazz. Friday night stars boogie-woogie piano whiz Michael Kaeshammer and Saturday serves up an homage to jazz legend Oscar Peterson.
For a truly unique outdoor concert venue, take in a show at the Etwell Concert Series. The series features live blues performances by top Canadian and international artists in a secluded and private setting just minutes outside the town centre. The Spring Family hosts the annual series on their rural property, where you can revel in the natural surroundings with a pavilion for shelter from the elements. Enjoy the warm summer night as the sounds of the blues echo through the surrounding trees. Chairs and benches are provided, and shows run rain or shine.

Get up close and personal with local musicians, catch your favourite artist on the Algonquin Theatre stage or head outdoors and experience a great concert surrounded by nature.

That, and the fact that I generally don't get involved ingameplay balancing topics since I don't know much about it.
Besides, that topic, i've read trough quite a number of pages now, and I find 90% irrelevant or outdated. So that topic isn't really worth much if you ask me.
Even if we add D5 without a whole lot of changes in comparison to D4 besides the rank, I'd still like it to have more to it, which is difficult ofcourse.
Anyway, they are irrelevant because their oppinions are too wide... few are the players that agree to each other.
2. New d5 items, add items, even if u do paint edition still better then nothing... get the noob armor for each class, replace with new bmps and make new look for d5s, let the noob wear the 2nd armor to change the first look, lol
3. HARD! must be hard get d5, theres a few unability items arround, such as dkhelmet or orc hearts, etc... i like what SS said, but i dont think 1k df is enough, maybe 24quest also but each quest ask u like 250 + a random item or xxx ppl kill in local war or castle or 50honor per quest + ...... so this could motivate also all join wars...
5. try help noobs reach higher faster, i do think this server is easy enough but for new ppl who join aint that easy seeing every is d2, d3+ or those who d1 they got lvl 130 180tt... keep the XO for under lvl 100, make some improvements n stuff... help them...
6. For once, u got all registered mails of accounts, make something n spam every1 mail with mails that DR is improving n such, dunno...
By putting this in the "Completed" category, does this entail that D5 will be added to the next server maintence or that D5 will continue to wait until more content is made?
It'll do as the title describes; not adding dual class 5 until further content is developed. There's other topics on the actual content/balancing of D5.
This discussion/exploration I've been engaged in elsewhere so I thought I would share it and see what you think.
Egyptologists do not have a commonly agreed upon theory about the origins of the ankh. Over the years several theories have been put forth. Below is a list of some of the proposed origins of the ankh:
The belt buckle of the mother goddess Isis. Similar to the Tyet symbol (also known as the Isis Knot). (Sir Wallis Budge, and later Westendorf)
A combination of the male and female symbols of Osiris (the cross) and Isis (the oval) respectively, and therefore signifies the union of heaven and Earth.
Winfred Blackman observed the following in the rural areas of Upper-Egypte in ca 1925. In her book ‘The Fellahin of Upper Egypt’ she writes p. 64: ‘Others [mothers of newborns] – and this is a very common traditions – take a piece of the umbilical cord and sow it into a piece of cotton; this is then hung around the neck of the child with a piece of cord.” On p. 79 there's a picture of such an umbilical cord wrapped in cotton, both ends tied together so that a circle is formed and so that this could even be worn around the neck of the child.
Considering the meaning of the word ankh, life, and this afore mentioned tradition that may reach back to Pharaonic times, it would not surprise me if the ankh represented the umbilical cord that would have originally been hung around the child's neck or waist to protect it and give it further life. (Idea originally communicated by Phillipe G., owner of the Dutch forum pr kmt and translated here.)
And Nick suggested - based on visual interpretation - that the loop represents the trace the sun makes as it travels through the sky, the horizontal bars represent the horizon and the vertical bar represents the reflection of the sun in the water. Thereby having the ankh combine some of the very basic components of egyptian beliefs: water, the sun, and the land itself.
The path of the sun from east to west (with the loop representing the delta) Life needs sun and water.
I'm not sure why the sandal strap would be a case of Occam's Razor here. The idea from linguistics that there has to be a connection between the sandal and life because their words sound similar is a rather outdated one. That line of reasoning is no longer accepted by linguists.
I'm not sure why a sandal would represent life? I guess that off all the theories listed I personally find that one the least likely.
The stylized person or the umbilical cord theory makes much more sense to me. Or even the sun rising over the horizon for that matter.
There's also a theory, which was presented at the ICE in 2000, that the /anx/ symbol presented a detailed symbol of female genitalia as presented at birth, symbolised by the /sA/ sign and the girdle knot (Gardiner sign S24), which represented the vagina and uterus conjoined.
I have no specific allegiance to these (or any other) theories about the /anx/, but wished to note additional theories.
Thanks for adding those neseret. I had not heard of any of those, but I can see why people would pose these theories.
The association of the Ankh with Life or Lifeforce on numerous levels (think Osiris as the 'green' vegitation/regenerative 'energy') may indicate the Ankh as being a physical representation of an actual SEED PLANTER
Given the great value placed on grain, crop and land-use individual grains planted at specified depths, specific distances apart might be seen as a 'life-giving' efficiency - this ancient key (agricultural tool) could then have passed through the ages to become a representation of the lifeforce itself
Of course, this 'tool' could then have been seen as a representation (due to shape etc.,) of the sun and its course through the heavens, ie; multiple levels of understanding
I have also heard that it had to do with water, and it was literally the balance of water. This makes sense to me because there is a hieroglyph of Horus and Thoth pouring out ankhs onto the pharaoh. Something associated with water makes sense in this usage. The term described by Mark Lehner is asgat nefer, balance of water, this heiroglyph is found in the temple of Maya.
Actually that was my broken understanding of what I remembered to have read. It says actually that the ankh was life, and that water was important to life. Asgat Nefer was a key principle. The hieroglpyh for asgat nefer were three combined... A bowl above, and a calf with a knee water spout beneath and to the left, and beneath and to the right was the sign for goodness, a sort of standing oval with a cross coming up. That was asgat nefer.
... Originally, Mark Lehner traveled to Egypt as a tourist in 1972. However, he was at that time a devotee of the ideas of Edgar Cayce (the Sleeping Profit) who is will known by ancient Egypt enthusiasts. Edgar Cayce was a mystic who believed that the civilization of Disney Land had entrusted their knowledge and technology to the ancient Egyptians. ...
... Mark Lehner traveled to Egypt in order to further that claim, as well as other visions of Edgar Cayce. He even published at least one book in support of Edgar Cayce's claims (The Egyptian Heritage, 1974). It is perhaps interesting that fringe elements continue today to reference this early work of Dr. Lehner, because long ago he became a convert to more traditional Egyptology. ...
, what I meant to say was that Stephen S Mehler describes the hieroglyph and concept asgat nefer. I got the names confused.

Because when we give too many fucks, when we choose to give a fuck about everything, then we feel as though we are perpetually entitled to feel comfortable and happy at all times, that’s when life fucks us.

A Newark charter high school faced a storm of online outrage this week after it forced dozens of students onto the street on the first day of class due to minor uniform infractions, such as lacking belts or wearing shoes with white soles instead of black.
After the students were sent out of Marion P. Thomas Charter School on Monday, a community activist found them idling at a nearby park. He then confronted school staffers about the incident; videos of the confrontation that were posted online have been viewed more than 560,000 times and generated hundreds of angry comments.
“Why would you kick a child 13 or 14 years old out into the streets?” said Thomas “Afrika” Ibiang, the activist who confronted the officials, in an interview Friday. “It makes no sense unless you see those people as less than.”
Founded in 1999 by Newark’s historic New Hope Baptist Church, Marion P. Thomas now enrolls about 1,600 students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. With a student population that is 94 percent black and 6 percent Hispanic, the school describes itself as “the largest minority led, independently operated free public charter school in New Jersey.”
About a third of Newark students attend charter schools, which are publicly funded but independently operated. While widespread and popular with many Newark families, charter schools remain controversial. Critics have attacked their strict discipline policies, and officials — including Mayor Ras Baraka — have called for a halt to the charter sector’s rapid expansion.
According to Marion P. Thomas officials, parents were informed about the dress code through fliers, automated phone calls, and a family orientation meeting before classes began on Aug. 27. (The school was only in session from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. the first week.) When some of the network’s high school students arrived that morning without the proper uniform — khaki pants, blue shirts with the school logo, belts, and black shoes — they were told to leave until their uniforms met all the requirements.
After they were turned away, many of the students ventured to a park across the street from the school’s Central Ward campus. Ibiang, who runs a nonprofit called Ma’at Youth Services with his wife, was leading a youth basketball camp at the park. He said he soon saw roughly 50 students congregating at the park, sitting on benches or playing basketball to pass the time.
“Chalkbeat gives you an authoritative, at-a-glance overview of major education news and topics, both local and national.” — Megan M.
He then asked a boy in a blue Marion P. Thomas polo shirt what happened, according to a video Ibiang recorded on his phone. The video, which was posted on Facebook, has been viewed over 560,000 times.
A screenshot of a video taken by Thomas “Afrika” Ibiang showing a Marion P. Thomas Charter School student who was turned away from school because his shoes were not completely black.
“Because I got white on my sneakers,” he replies. The video shows the boy’s black sneakers have partially white soles.
“And they say because you have white on your shoes you can’t get into school?” Ibiang says, which the boy confirms.
Other videos show Ibiang asking employees in the school’s main office why the students were sent away. As Ibiang raises his voice in frustration, the employees ask whether he has a “scholar” who attends the school and why he is recording the interaction.
“To keep track, to have evidence,” he replies. “I don’t trust people who kick our kids into the street.”
The widely viewed videos have generated hundreds of comments. Some of the commenters sided with the school, saying parents are responsible for making sure their children adhere to the uniform policy. But others said they were horrified that the school would deny students a day of learning simply because they were out of uniform.
“Education don’t matter to them,” one woman wrote on the school’s Facebook page. “Only the control of the students do.”
Malika Berry said her son, Sahir Minatee, a former 10th-grader at Marion P. Thomas, was one of the students turned away Monday because his shoes were not completely black. She said she only learned that Sahir had been kept out of school through online messages, and was never notified by the school.
When Sahir returned to school Tuesday, she said school employees informed him that his family had not submitted the necessary paperwork to verify they live in the city. (Charter schools must show that their students live within the district in order to receive state funds.)
Berry says she tried to present residency documents to the school this week, but they said the deadline had passed and she would have to re-enroll through the district, which handles both charter and traditional school admissions. After visiting the district enrollment office, her son was assigned to West Side High School, she said.
“I haven’t eaten, I haven’t slept,” Berry said. “My son is stressed out; he has to go to a new school.”
Misha Simmonds, Marion P. Thomas’ interim chief school administrator, declined to discuss Sahir’s situation specifically.
He said the school began notifying families in the spring that they had to re-verify their residency in order to remain enrolled. The school continued to call and write families over the summer until the enrollment deadline in mid-July, Simmonds said. After that, about 75 students were “dis-enrolled,” and their families were informed by phone or letter, he said.
Regarding Monday’s incident, he said the school told parents about the dress code before classes began. Still, officials soon recognized that they made a mistake by forcing students onto the streets if they were not fully in uniform, Simmonds said.
“We acknowledge there could have been safety issues with students turned away from school and ending up in the park, and that’s not what our intent was,” he said. “Safety is our ultimate priority.”
On Tuesday, the school did not force out any students who were not in uniform. Instead, the school helped the students correct any dress code violations by giving them belts or black socks or using black tape to cover any non-black parts of their shoes, Simmonds said.
He also sent families a letter on Tuesday explaining that the uniform policy is meant to foster unity, “bridge socioeconomic differences between students,” and prepare them for the workplace, but that the school would no longer turn away students who are out of uniform.
“It’s important that we hold students to a high standard across all areas,” he told Chalkbeat, including in their dress, behavior, and academics. “But we acknowledge that turning away students was not appropriate.”
Newark families could have a harder time applying to certain schools this year if changes sought by the district’s new superintendent spur some charter schools to pull out of the city’s common enrollment system, charter advocates say.
Superintendent Roger León is pushing for the system to no longer assign schools extra students to offset attrition over the summer, according to people briefed on negotiations over the enrollment system. The practice, known as “overmatching,” helps both district and charter schools plan for the coming year, but it also ensures that charter schools fill their seats — something León appears less willing to help with than his charter-friendly predecessors.
The dispute means that district and charter leaders are still hashing out rules for the five-year-old common enrollment system just weeks before applications are due to open. Now, some charter schools are considering withdrawing entirely — potentially triggering a return to the fragmented application process families faced before universal enrollment launched in 2013, charter proponents say.
“Realistically, it’s possible that could happen,” said one of the people briefed on the talks who, like the others, asked to remain anonymous while negotiations continue. “We’re really late in the game right now.”
The dustup marks another instance where León appears eager to roll back his predecessors’ policies — even if it means moving quickly, before all the potential consequences are known.
On the first day of classes, he told principals he was eliminating extra hours for struggling schools, forcing them to scramble to reset their schedules. And before even taking office on July 1, he pushed out dozens of top officials — a move the school board, which was not consulted in advance, partially blocked.
One of those officials was the district’s head of enrollment, Gabrielle Ramos-Solomon. She oversaw the universal enrollment system, called “Newark Enrolls,” which lets families apply to most of the city’s traditional, magnet, and charter schools using a single application. After a chaotic launch that outraged many parents, the system today gets high marks on user surveys. Yet it remains controversial among critics of charter schools who view it little more than a ploy to funnel students into the privately managed schools.
One feature of the system is that it assigns schools — both charter and district — more students than they have space for. This “overmatching” is done to account for the attrition that occurs each year as some students leave the city or decamp to private or county schools. A former district official estimated that most schools lose between 5 to 20 percent of their assigned students that way.
Now, overmatching has become a sticking point in the negotiations, according to those with knowledge of the talks, as León has proposed ending the practice.
It is unclear why, and the district did not make León available for an interview. One possibility is that doing so might appease critics without dismantling common enrollment, which León has said he wants to keep.
But some people in the charter sector believe the superintendent, wanting to retain as many students as possible in the district, is loath to send charters extra students. That prospect has alarmed some charter school operators who fear they could end up with unfilled seats and reduced budgets, as school funding is based on enrollment.
To illustrate how overmatching works, a person connected to the charter-school sector gave an example of a high school with 100 available ninth-grade seats. In the past, the enrollment system might assign the school 115 students based on the assumption that roughly 15 students would not end up attending. If the system only matched 100 students to the school, then it could be left with 15 open seats.
“At an independent charter school, when those 15 students don’t show up, there’s no money coming from anywhere else to adjust their budget,” the person said. “That could put them out of business.”
If the district stops sending charter schools extra students, those schools are likely to start admitting more students from their waitlists. If that happens, district schools may suddenly lose students who were on their rosters. They would then have openings that are likely to be filled by students who arrive midyear, who are often some of the most challenging students to serve.
“District principals hate losing kids to charter waitlists,” the former district official said. “It creates a lot of instability.”
León met with charter-school representatives Thursday, but no final agreement was reached. Even if the two sides work out a compromise, the district’s board of education and each of the boards overseeing the participating charter schools must still vote on the plan.
They have limited time to do that without disrupting the normal admissions cycle. Typically, families can start applying to schools for the following year in the first week of December.
Newark Public Schools spokeswoman Tracy Munford said enrollment would start at the same time this year even though the district-charter enrollment agreement has not been finalized.
Meanwhile, some charter school leaders have discussed the possibility of forming a separate charter-only enrollment system if they decide to withdraw from Newark Enrolls. The heads of smaller charter-school organizations are most concerned about the proposed changes, according to a person familiar with their thinking.
Last school year, 13 of the city’s 19 charter school operators participated in the joint enrollment system. (The others each handled their own admissions.) Most families who used Newark Enrolls were matched with one of the top three choices on their applications — 94 percent who applied to kindergarten got a top pick, as did 70 percent who applied to ninth-grade.
Assigning schools more students than they have space for allows additional students to be matched with high-demand schools, said Jesse Margolis, an education researcher who has studied Newark’s enrollment system. The schools end up with roughly the right number of students because some of those on their rosters never show up. And students who would have been assigned to a less popular school if the system hadn’t overmatched instead get to attend one at the top of their list.
“Overmatching is a way of helping kids get their preferences,” said Margolis, who co-wrote a favorable report about Newark Enrolls commissioned by the district’s previous superintendent, Christopher Cerf. “And it helps schools have stable, predictable enrollments.”
Correction: This story has been updated to remove an inaccurate explanation for why some charter schools are more wary of a change to enrollment rules than others.
Election results: Newark voters stick with an elected school board, NJ voters approve $500 million for schools
Newark voters decided Tuesday that the power to choose school board members should remain in their hands, not the mayor’s.
In a referendum held during Tuesday’s midterm elections, voters overwhelmingly opted for an elected school board over one appointed by the mayor. Their decision comes less than a year after the state ended its decades-long takeover of the district, putting the nine-member board back in charge of New Jersey’s largest school system and its nearly $1 billion budget.
Statewide, voters narrowly authorized the state to borrow $500 million to pay for the expansion of vocational programs, school security upgrades, and improvements to schools’ water infrastructure. The money for career training will only go to county-run schools and colleges — a boon to those schools, but a potential threat to the district if it leads more students to opt for vocational-technical schools over traditional high schools.
As a result of Newark’s school-board referendum, which was required by state law, voters will continue to elect board members and approve the district’s budget. That outcome was widely expected. The Newark Teachers Union and prominent politicians — including Mayor Ras Baraka, who championed the district’s return to local control — had all urged voters to stick with an elected board.
In a pre-election message posted on the city’s website, Baraka said that allowing the mayor to handpick board members would give him “enormous direct power over education in Newark.”
Also on Tuesday, New Jersey voters re-elected U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat, over his Republican rival, Bob Hugin. The high-profile race, which flooded the airwaves with bitter attack ads, drew a large number of voters to the polls despite heavy rain throughout the day.
However, some Newark voters said they were surprised to find questions about school funding and board elections on the ballot when they arrived at their polling sites. Debora Walker, a poll worker at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Newark’s Central Ward, said she had not seen any ads or information about the two education-focused questions before Nov. 6.
In February, the state put Newark’s school board back in charge of the district, ending 22 years of state control when the board had only advisory powers. Now, the board is once again responsible for selecting the superintendent and overseeing district spending, hiring, and policymaking.
When districts return to local control, state law mandates that voters be given the choice between an elected or mayor-appointed board. Proponents say that granting mayors control of schools forces them to prioritize education because it hitches their political fortunes to the fate of the school system.
But the vast majority of boards nationally and in New Jersey are elected, which most voters are reluctant to change. Newark’s board has been elected since 1982 — and many observers doubted that voters would trade it for an appointed board just as the city regained control of its schools.
“At this particular time, people have a heightened sense of, ‘No, we’re not letting anyone else be in charge,’” said Mary Bennet, a former Newark principal who led a group that advised the district on its return to local control. With an elected board, voters will know that “what they say counts — and people they elected, they can hold them accountable for how they sit up there and vote.”
Of that amount, $100 million will go to districts to improve the quality of their schools’ drinking water. In 2016, Newark was forced to replace pipes and water fountains in dozens of schools after their water was found to contain high levels of lead. Because most of that remediation has already been completed, it’s unclear how much of the $100 million Newark would be eligible to receive.
Another $350 million is allocated for county vocational programs and school security upgrades, such as new alarm systems. The bond act does not say how that amount will be divided.
The county vocational-technical schools will use their share of the money to expand programs that let students study trades, such as manufacturing and medical technology, while also earning high-school diplomas. In 2017, about 10 percent of Newark students chose to attend one of Essex County’s four “vo-tech” schools over one of the city’s district or charter high schools.
While the bond act was being crafted, some critics noted that it does not set aside any money for the vocational programs that some district high schools offer. Vocational programs at traditional high schools are open to all students, whereas vo-tech schools screen applicants based on their grades, test scores, and other factors.
Judy Savage, executive director of the New Jersey Council of County Vocational-Technical Schools, said the county schools desperately need more funding to meet the demand from students. Last year, the schools had nearly 17,000 more applicants than available seats.
“Enrollment has been growing,” she said, “and the vocational schools are turning away more students than they can admit.”

Theme: ‘Public policies for financing the social and solidarity economy to strengthen its values and competitiveness’
APD 2018 is the 4th edition of the Asia Policy Dialogue (APD), the regional platform for promoting social economy public policies by brining local authorities, practitioners, researchers and policymakers in the region. APD 2018 will focus on different strategies of financing the social economy across 10 different countries in Asia.
To interpret the theme of the GSEF2018, “Social Economy and Cities: Values and Competitiveness for an Inclusive and Sustainable Local Development” in the context of Asia, especially focused on the financial system for supporting SSE organizations as a pre-discussion of the GSEF2018.
To discuss what kind of policy measures to be adopted in order to expand the SSE organizations’ social impacts and competitiveness in the market and how the process of policy making and implementation should be done.
To offer opportunities for participating GSEF members and partners to brainstorm and search for a more specific and viable collaborative project through the network.
To develop the Asia Policy Dialogue as a regular forum on social economy policies in Asia and a networking platform for policymakers, advocators, and practitioners of SSE, based on the evaluation and outcome of the last four policy dialogues of GSEF.
What are the characteristics of the social economy in Asia to be recognized in its social values and competitiveness for and inclusive and sustainable local development?
How the funding and financial system to promote social economy could be established and strengthened?
What are the suitable social finance schemes according to the stage of growth among Asian social economy enterprises in their local economic and social contexts?
What kind of legal consideration and policy initiatives are required for the finance for social economy to be properly managed in order to maximize social impacts of SSE enterprises?
How can the cooperation between cities through international network could strengthen each region’s social finance ecosystem?
Since 2014, the APD has played a key role in promoting knowledge exchanges between policymakers in searching for the best ways of co-constructing public policies, establishing eco-systems for promoting the Social & Solidarity Economy (SSE) and social innovation to tackle various societal and urban challenges in Asia wherein social enterprises are playing an increasingly pivotal role in the provision of social services as well as serving as a catalyst for industrial innovations.

Just picked up QV hand cream fri. Priceline after being impressed by the tester. I wash my hands a lot for work and it felt like it created a nice barrier. It's unscented and suitable for sensitive skin, eczema, etc. Cheap too!
For L'Occitane / shea butter cream lovers: I bought some unrefined shea butter and jojoba oil off eBay and made my own whipped shea butter cream. It takes a while to sink in but much is more potent and far cheaper than any of the commercially available ones I've seen.
Not sure but indirectly, if you join their mailing list, they occasionally have % off sales throughout the year (the last one I remember was before last Xmas).
L'Occitane & Clarins for me. They just do. I don't even use them regulary.. don't know why I fork out on these items I rarely even use.
Other then moisturising skin, I don't think handcreams can treat wrinkled hands. You might have to look specially into that, visit a derm if it really bothers.
As a nurse my hands take a beating, but even when I'm at home I don't have the time or the patience for overly greasy and slow to absorb formulas unless they're going to deliver remarkable results. The L'Occitane Scrub and Creams are little wonders
L'Occitane is also on StrawberryNet, only maybe 10% cheaper than retail but if you have loyalty etc discounts as well it might be worthwhile.
my friend bought me this pack of hand creams from DJs called le couvent des minimes and they are so creamy, smells good and awesome in general. I find it really moisturizes& after a month or so i feel that my hands are becoming softer. not sure if it'll help with the wrinkles tho
In the past few months I've noticed my hands getting more and more like, what I call, granny hands - arrrgghh!
I've been searching for years and have not been able to find one that actually works, ever since Rosken changed their Skin Repair formula several years ago.
Just wanted to ask if you ever found a good antidote to granny hands? I've been trying unsuccessfully to find one for years - used to find Rosken Skin Repair very good, until they altered their formula several years ago.
which hand cream for dry, chapped hands? laeticia521 Beauty: Skincare and Fragrance 29 17-10-2005 09:05 AM

- Tustan is an old military complex, a customs and a city-fortress. Its remains are in the Carpathian Mountains (Eastern Beskydy). During four centuries, from the second half of the IX to the middle of the XIII century, on the rocks existed a mighty wooden castle Tustan which was built by nobles White Croats.
Tustan was an important strategic point and was a part of the Carpathian (Hungarian) defense line of the south - western borders of Kievan Rus, and later Galicia - Volyn principality.

Geological monument "Dovbush Rocks" is a natural fortress of X century period. A unique rock complex, named in the honour of the legendary opryshok (the outlaw in Carpathians) Oleksa Dovbush, located at an altitude of 668 m above sea level. Because of shape and location this is a unique accumulation of giant rocks, stones, reminiscent of the amazing creatures, with deep and always dark ravines, pits, secret passages and paths.
Parashka mountain is one of the highest and most beautiful mountains of "Skole Beskydy". The height is 1268 meters above sea level. This is the first mountain range, which stretches along the main flat part of the Carpathians. Rising to a height, you can admire the views of neighboring ridges on one side and 30 km of plain on the other. The route is about 10 km.
This route is of average complexity that enchants with its paths and beech forest. You can feel here the greatness and beauty of "Skole Beskydy". Mountain Lopata is known for the ten-year battle in 1944 between the UPA (Ukrainian Insurgent Army) and the combined German-Hungarian troops.
It’s a Memorial and Military Cemetery of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen (USS). It was rebuilt in 1998-99 in the honour of the USS region heroes who died in April and May 1915 during the First World War in a battle with russian tsarists troops.

In australia and USA, because GSM has stopped to be used or will be stopped very soon. So have to use the GSM-AUTO 4G version. Our 4G version is totally compatible with the GSM-AUTO or GSM-AUTO-AC. that PC software and APP are all totally compatible
The GSM-AUTO is a GSM remote control switch, it connects to the cell phone network and like a cell phone has its own cell phone number. The GSM-AUTO is activated by calling its cell phone number, it will recognise an authorised telephone number calling it, reject the call without answering and switch on or off the device connected to it, because it rejects the call without answering there are no call costs incurred.
It has 2 independent relay switches with normally open and normally closed switch contacts, these can be programmed to switch on for a pre-determined length of time whenever the GSM-AUTO controller is called.
The relay switches can also be temporarily or permanently switched on or off by sending the GSM-AUTO a sms text message command. It can report the relay status by sending back a text message.
Below is a file showing how the GSM-AUTO is being used to control an aircrafts engine pre-heaters, thanks to Ken Sutton for producing this video and supplying us with his project details.
If you have completed a project using the GSM-AUTO and would like to share the deails please contact us.
Applications are endless and include the remote control of heating and air conditioning in holiday homes, lighting, engine pre-heaters, aviation engine heaters, irrigation systems, water well pumps, pumping stations, cabin heaters, power cycle and reboot of remote servers, routers and computers.
Additional MODE command,then you can use the dial to switch the relay output, not only toggle the relay to work a GOT timer delay.
More freely when select to work at Open access mode ( ACM=OFF). any number can dial to control the device,any phone number can send the SMS to control the device. then our device would be very easy for customer to use on the side. not complicated programming.
Additional fast teach button, would save a lot time to read the manual command carefully. easy to press the button to teach the deive and then can control the device very easily.
Automatically work from time to time in the preset days in a week. it can work on every week day and also can be preset only work one day
Quad band GSM-850, GSM-900, GSM-1800, GSM-1900 MHz so will work anywhere in the world where there is a GSM cell phone network
Two independent relays that can be programmed to switch on for a period of time between 1 second and 18 hours when the unit is called. Two access modes are available, open access where the GSM-AUTO will respond to any incoming call, and secure access where it will only respond to programmed authorized telephone numbers.
Up to 500 authorized user telephone numbers can be added to the white list, when the secure access mode is activated only the numbers in the white list are able to activate the GSM-AUTO. Authorized numbers can be added and deleted as required by sending the unit sms text commands.
The relays can be permanently switched on or off by sending the GSM-AUTO a text message command, a confirmation text can be returned if required.
The relays can be temporarily switched on for a period of time between 1 second and 18 hours by sending the GSM-AUTO a text message command, a confirmation text can be returned when the relays turn on and off if required.
Two relay's with normally open (N.O) and normally closed (N.C) contacts, maximum switching capacity is 10 amps @ 230V ac per relay.
NOTE: You will need a SIM card, the GSM-AUTO is not locked to any cell phone network so it can be used with any GSM network provider. You can purchase SIM cards here SIM cards
Some US network providers are now locking sim cards to the phone they were purchased with, this means the sim card will not work with any other device. Call your network provider and ask them to unlock the sim card, they will ask for the IMEI number of the device you wish to use the sim card with, this can be found on a white label just above the antenna connection. From the feedback we have received it seems that AT&T are helpful whereas simple mobile, trak-phone and Verizon are not.
You will also need a 12 volt DC power supply with a current rating of 500mA (0.5 Amp), a suitable US power supply can be found above.
Very Easy,Fast and Safety to visit out online store to order the samples directly of GSM remote controller,automatic door sensor and coin acceptors.

Posted on June 23rd, by gspf in 2016 Festival Program, 2016 Street. Comments Off on Zoe Scoglio – Land Forms II
Land Forms is inspired by the scientific concept of abiogenesis, the idea that living matter originates from non-living matter. Considering these origins of the human race, the work draws connections between human and geological scale, timeframes and materiality.
Zoe’s practice explores how the narratives we create about our idea of humanness, impact the way we commodify, consume and value the natural world and its resources in this era of the Anthropocene.
Land Forms II is one in a series of video collages contemplating the interrelated nature of the human and geological worlds.
Zoe Scoglio unites performance, video, sound and installation often creating interdisciplinary, site-responsive and participatory work. Her live and participatory projects explore possibilities for collective engagement, ceremonial encounters and enlivened installations, combining both animate and inanimate bodies in a relational choreography.
Graduating with a Bachelor of Media Arts (Hons) at RMIT University in 2008, Zoe has since worked nationally and internationally on solo and collaborative projects, and as a video designer and videographer for dance, theatre and opera. Self-devised works include Green Room Award Winning ‘MASS’, made for Calder Park Raceway (Field Theory, Site is Set 2015) and Green Room Award Winning ‘Shifting Ground’ (Arts House, 2012). Shifting Ground toured to Tramway-Glasgow and Apiary Studios-London (2014), Operadagen Rotterdam and to Music Theatre NOW – Netherlands (2016).
Zoe has presented work in Bangkok, Berlin, Istanbul and Iceland; and Nationally through such organisations as Next Wave Festival, FOLA, PYT and MCA C3West (upcoming), Melbourne Festival, Liquid Architecture, Dance House, Channels Video Art Festival, Tape Projects, West Space, Blindside, Underbelly Festival, ReelDance, Lucy Guerin Inc, Anna Pappas Gallery, Footscray Community Arts Centre, Dianne Tanzer Gallery and Brenda May Gallery.
Spawned from some projects at work, I have been reading and studying several of the cyrptocurrencies (for about the last year or so) and over the last 2 weeks I’ve constructed a basic experimental rig.
My current mining rig has 9 Nvidia cards spread between 1060/1070/1080. I’ve been characterizing each of them for power and hash performance to see if the things I had been reading online actually match up in reality and they appear to.
My idea is to begin mining several of the alt coins starting solely with Feathercoin with the idea of generating 20-30k coins over the period of 3 months or so and the holding the coins. Rotating through several coins to build up positions in them through mining across 2018.
I am currently hashing at about 5.6Mh/s on Feathercoin and I believe I can boost my current performance about 10-15% with these 9 cards. Currently I’ve invested about $4k or so in the 9 card system.
I want to review the results and coin counts over the next 2 weeks during my “Experiment” phase. If the coin counts look correct (based on hash and difficulty rate) I will then try Phase-2.
Phase-2 would be to add 10 additional 1080 or 1080TI cards (or a mix of AMD and Nvidia) cards. My estimates on adding 10 more 1080TI cards would raise my hash rate to around 47MH/s on Feathercoin. This would require another $8k investment in my mining hardware bringing my total investment to around $12k.
Now, Assuming a three month window with increasing difficulty of 80, 160, and 320 , I calculate the coin count to be as follows. 13k month1, 7k month2, and 3k month3. Total of about 20k coins. Now, if the USD value of the coins stays around 30cents, that would be worth about $6k US or close to the amount of the Phase-2 costs.
If the value of FTC drops 50% while the difficultly still raises to 320, then my value in US is somewhere around $3k. In theory I’m sure I could see 10 NVidia 1080TI cards in a batch for $3k-$4k as well. So liquidating hardware and FTC would get me close to my $7k phase-2 investment.
Now, if the difficulty rises to around 200 or so and the value of the coin raises to around $0.75, my math claims I may have closer to 30k coins valued at around $22k USD.
If after three months, any of these scenarios play out (meaning I have around 20k coins valued in the range of $3k to $22k USD) I would be highly inclined to add even more mining power and continue to mine for the rest of 2018 on both FTC and some other coins as well.
I am willing to invest maybe $20k to $30k USD in graphics cards for mining over the next several months.
I am looking at “investment time” in the 1-2 year range with a few “Experiments” to sanity check the results in 3 month moving windows.
I’d like to hear form others on this. What am I missing? What am I overlooking that could make my “investment” worth even less than $3k (aside from a complete market collapse).
Is the “current level” you were using about 80? That seems to be true so far, but if FTC stays on its current trend, that might not be the case. On the other hand, it seems to be jumping around a lot right now, varying between < 50 to over 200. As I’m typing it’s at 216, and just a half hour ago it was less than 50!
Right now that seems reasonable. It was interesting to watch the price action over the past week or so where its BTC price went down to keep the USD price the same, then the USD price went up to get the BTC price back to where it was! If BTC fluctuates more it’s hard to know what will happen. It seems there are market participants who are interested in the USD price and those interested in the BTC price. It seems there is a correlation between BTC, though, which is certainly interesting. It’s possible that your assumption is fair, given the ones who were looking to maintain the USD price where it was. On the other hand, they were the ones pushing it down. But against that, the market seems to have blown through their selling pressure. A very interesting market for sure!
Crypto currency is still super volatile. The question of risk is only what you can handle. I don’t think you should put in any more than you are willing to lose, but then that goes for any investment.
I think the sanity checks are a good idea, especially because the landscape can change pretty quick. I really like the FTC community, and they’ve dealt with problems in the past for sure.
A lot less regulatory risk than there used to be, but it still exists, also need to consider tax consequences, which can be tricky.
Welcome to the new world of crypto currency, this is not history repeating it’self. No one can predict what will happen.
I don’t give advice as, one day, someone might take it, but my friends and I, Invest or support coins we think deserve to succeed …
I’m 50% to my goal of ~40MH/s or so. Its proven hard to order so many graphics cards, I have to get a volume account setup for my business - so I have been ordering them in small groups.
I currently have three Windows 10 PCs running. This took some effort to get it all running and stable, but it appears like its running well now.
Currently this puts me right around 20MH/s which is starting to make a good number of coins per day. I am experimenting with some of the profit switching algorithms and direct mining as well as some custom software/scripts that I am developing for mining as well.

Square Enix has released the 4.25 update for their MMORPG, Final Fantasy XIV, which unveils the forbidden land of Eureka and introduces new combat elements.
The mysterious new region is unexplored and wild, while the forces of nature are in constant flux. As a player, you’ll have to face and master new challenging combat elements to gain powerful new weapons. The content update also features the latest chapter in the adventure of master criminologist Hildibrand and opens the seventh season of the PvP tournament “The Feast”.
The Prohibited Land of Eureka is a vast, untouched stretch of land that has undergone a number of changes to the game system’s principles to date:
Huge playing field: Up to 144 players can fight together in one instance. Players are encouraged to team up with other adventurers to hunt infamous monsters and pursue common goals.
Player Development: Players will receive special experience points to better take advantage of the elements. But caution is required! Anyone who runs head over heels in Eureka loses Element experience points or even experience levels.
Modified Combat Mechanics: The element-based combat requires additional strategies. Players must use the Magia tablet to adjust the elemental value of their attacks and counteract the element of their opponents. The Magia board can be customized, depending on the goal, the adjustments should be carefully thought out by the player.
Rewards: When exploring Eureka, players occasionally receive protean crystals that can be used by master smith Gerolt to enhance Eureka weapons and equipment.

(3) Abu Sulayman Ahmad bin Hawtha narrated from Ibraheem bin Iss’haq an-Nahawandi from Abdullah bin Hammad al-Ansari from Abdullah bin Bukayr that Hamran bin A’yun had said:
Many people find it very difficult getting the most appropriate designer lighting from the store. This is on the grounds that there are a lot of items in the market that can make one confounded on the most proper one to settle on. When you are at the store and are not learned toward the best path, you can get quite confounded on the item to purchase. A home’s inside vibe is enormously managed by the lighting that you introduce; once you don’t hit the nail on the head, you won’t feel that good. Even if you purchase the most expensive furniture, you’ll only be halfway through, you need to install the best lighting framework so that everything can look amazing.
Original lighting fixtures are among the best; they are very rare and cost much money. Just a couple of us can bear the cost of owning one of them. For those that have much cash, purchasing this accumulation will be one of the best choices that they have ever constructed. If you are searching for a reasonable thing, you can decide on approved reproductions. Here, you are not going to spend much money. They are going to bring your closer to the original model. From fresh out of the plastic new ones to closeout lights, you can be guaranteed of the quality and in addition guarantees and after deals benefit as trustworthy organizations are fabricating them. You can also opt for imitations. There are occasions that you may be low on money yet at the same time require a decent looking lighting installation at your home, well, you can go for this model. Most of them are created from China and distributed all over the globe. Very amazing, however, you are not guaranteed of the nature of the item you are purchasing. They likewise have item guarantees; yet restricted guarantees. If you get this product, once you go home, it is now upon you to make sure that it doesn’t get damaged whatsoever as you are going to incur all the repair costs.
Collectibles are stunning purchases for those individuals with an eye for nostalgia. These are still exceptionally uncommon and to a great degree exorbitant things. They are very beautiful items, but you cannot expose them to high voltage power since they may cause a fire. Collectibles made before 1920’s can just suit a 15-watt knob. Collectibles made in the mid-1920’s up to the 50’s can convey a load of up to 40 watts max. When you need something that can go past this wattage sum, pick collectibles that were made past the sixties. These antiques make a home look very great. Talk with a home architect before you settle on designer bulbs. They are knowledgeable about the endeavor and would offer you extraordinary guidance.

We will be playing Ricochet, which most of you already own thanks to your half-life collection, on Friday, January 26, at 8pm EST. Some how there are several community servers still up and running, so we'll just take over one of those.
Please consider joining us in Mumble while we play! While we have a discord server for announcements, we use Mumble for voice chatting.
I feel like I'm going to be paying $5 for the experience of being hopelessly confused, but I'll do it.
Don't forget, if you don't have Ricochet, you can buy it now, play it with us tonight, and then refund it later as long as you don't play for 2 hours!
I am currently doing a teaching fellowship, teaching summer school at a Charter School in my hometown. All of my groups are great except for my math group which is mostly middle schoolers, plus a few really smart 4th graders.
Theres one really intelligent, manipulative student who somehow always manages to confound me. He is super smart but can be a bully to his fellow students and never stops talking.
A nickname for a boy named Carter I have is coach Carter. At one point I accidentally called a girl who was sitting in his spot "Coach Carter" because I wasnt looking. This boy I mentioned above I guess thought that was hilarious and used that as a springboard to bully the girl super bad and he would undercut every attempt I made to correct him with basically gaslighting me and stating I started the bullying. Anyhow I tried to be punitive because I hate bullying, but the administrators only let me give him a lunch detention. Anyhow he bullied the girl out of summer school over the course of the few weeks of school.
In general him and 2 other girls have nothing but contempt for me. I have to do so much just ot get them to do their work and they constantly just chat. Im moving their seats tomorrow to prevent that, but ultimately the kids just dont respect me. In some part this is due to my demeanor and voice. I come off very gay (and I am gay) and this is a constant source of mockery. Ive beefed up my tone and presentation a bit but the kids still continue on that track. I really dont know what to do to get them to knock it off. My administrators are super against the idea of "giving up on anybody" but its frankly such that a few of my students are holding everybody back out of sheer spite and nastiness
Maybe im not fit at all to be a teacher, maybe its administration. IDK. Maybe I ought to quit. What were your first few weeks teaching like?
Hi Zane! Welcome! So I'm a gay man in the teaching bizz as well, so I feel your pain. In a word, my first year or so: hell.
Firstly I would steer away from nicknames and the like. In my limited experience it's just a bad idea all around. It tends to lead to trouble like you're experiencing.
Secondly, unfortunately bullies are a part of life and sometimes it can be hard to figure out how you can intervene without making it worse. Try separating the students, on other ends of the room or so and see if you can isolate who starts it. Sometimes you can figure out okay this one starts it the other two go along with it.
But, my biggest question is why do you think you're a failure already? You've really just gotten started, right? How can success or failure possibly be determined so quickly? It doesn't matter how many times you fall, only how many times you get back up.
Im probably being a bit over dramatic. I just have no idea how to handle these kids and feel like im ruining everything by not being able to totally control my class and I feel like theres something really wrong with me that my students seem particularly troublesome.
I taught in a summer program and had a very difficult time with a group of students. It was mainly four girls but they were very disrespectful to me. I would not let them see you get mad or flustered. That will cause the behavior to get worse. Can you be more specific about one situation that you are facing in the classroom?
I don't think this means that you are not fit to be a teacher. Some groups of kids are difficult and you will grow from this!
I agree with the previous poster and I wouldn't use nicknames for students. It could cause them to think that it is ok to call each other names, which it is not.
Either the kid is making stuff up or maybe I was un-wedgying my pants or something like that, but this one kid has made that into "Mr. Marshall digs in his bootyhole". Anyhow I dont know what to do with something that ridiculous and it winds up making me angry/embarrassed for some reason. I know im too sensitive and all but it sucks!
You have to have a thick skin to be a teacher and kids can be rude. I wouldn't let a comment like that slide because it's disrespectful. Can you ask the student to step out into the hallway? Then you can have a private conversation with him/her. With a difficult class, it's best to address discipline privately so they do not have an audience.
The other thing Zane is that you're really new overall so your nerves and inexperience are working against you. But you definitely have to have a thick skin to be a teacher. That and classroom management skills come with time.
Kids are like sharks, and you're bleeding like a geyser. You need to learn to pick your battles. Remember that this is summer school; I'm guessing there's not a single kid in your class there because they want to be there.
Which... isn't that sad when you think about it? The idea that children are allowed to bully and harass teachers (adults) with no REAL consequences? What has happened to this society?
I remember growing up, in the 90's, we were afraid to speak up or speak out against our teacher. Even if we didn't like him or her or the way s/he taught or the work we had to do...w e kept our mouths shut and plowed on. Students today are so embolden to say exactly how they feel, which is fine to a point, but the harassment crosses the line!
Sadly you thinking about quitting isn't shocking or surprising as you'll find many of the next ¨generation´´ of teachers in the same exact boat. And they wonder why there´s a ¨teaching shortage?" It´s not all about the MONEY folks!
And then people have the audacity to say that you "knew what the kids were like when you signed up for the job..." umm no! Kids are just getting worse so it´s really hard to predict.
You WILL fail, but that doesn't make you a failure. Learn from those mistakes and grow as a teacher. I have had tons of fails over the year, but I am definitely not the teacher I was when I was student teaching, or even my first year teaching. I learned A LOT throughout the years.
Middle School is tough. Maybe the grade just isn't right for you. I remember when I was student teaching I was put into a kindergarten classroom to observe for a couple days. I'm still scarred. Later I did a semester in 2nd grade. I remember telling my cooperating teacher that I didn't think I was cut out for it... and she told me it probably wasn't the right age level for me. She was right! I'll take my high-schoolers any day.
Also, a lot of middle schoolers are insecure and unstable wrecks. Perhaps some are closeted themselves and it's easier to make fun of the teacher and deflect attention off of themselves?
I am in my 4th year of teaching, and guess what? I teach ELA and Social Studies to 5th graders in a public school and I have learned that kids can be cruel. I have worked at a charter school and to be honest they were rough on me the first year. They did not respect me, they called me gay and other names. I was supported by the administration, but not so much they helped all of this go away.
I guess what I am saying is please don't give up. You sound like a really nice guy and someone who cares about the field and the kids. Why would you have taken the time to write on this board if you didn't? I think you don't want to quit, or you are looking for advice. Well-- I will give you some.
1.) Don't give them nick names you don't have that rapport with them yet. I would start building it with them immediately. Start talking to them and even having lunch with them.
2.) Have you ever used class dojo? It's great. My parents are constantly in contact with me because I hound them down and really get them involved. I whip my phone out and have them sign up when I see them and I make sure the student sees that I am doing this. BELIEVE ME!!! It works.
3.) Give them a lot of structure. I would have them line up in a line order and give them a number they must line up in. Model for them how to walk in a line, how to enter and leave the rest room. How to sharpen a pencil, get your attention, how to switch between classes. There's a million routines and they need to be taught and explained and to practice. This comes down to your preference.
4.) Consequences... for those students that do not follow through and break them even if it is so minor... Give them the consequence or they will walk all over you. I would start out with a warning, then message parents on dojo as the second option as well as going to a desk alone and having them reflect on what they did.
5.) BE PATIENT. You might not see a change for a few weeks, but if you stay consistent they will learn you care, and that you mean business and your class will run so smoothly.
Hope that helps Zane! I would love to keep in contact with you to see how you are doing because it's rough... but please do not give up the kids need people like you!
I do have Class DOjo! The point system works great with younger kids, the one problem I have is that alot of parents still havent signed up but im hoping that changes, I plan on making naother flyer for it.

New records of the River Shark Glyphis (Carcharhinidae) reported from Cape York Peninsula, northern Australia
Full text not currently attached. Access may be available via the Publisher's website or OpenAccess link.
The distribution of the river shark Glyphis in northern Australia is extended with new records of occurrence in the Gulf of Carpentaria and a reassessment of historical survey data from Cape York Peninsula. Nine new specimens of Glyphis sp. A were collected in 2005 from the Weipa region on the Queensland coast of the Gulf of Carpentaria. A re-examination of archival records from 1978-86 marine and estuarine fish surveys in the Gulf of Carpentaria and along the northern Queensland East Coast allowed a further nineteen Glyphis specimens to be identified. Combined this gives twenty-eight new records of Glyphis specimens from the coasts of Cape York Peninsula, Queensland. Common habitat characteristics for all captures were turbid, shallow, fast running tidal water in the upper reaches of coastal rivers. The substrate was generally muddy and the rivers lined with mangrove. In all surveys the representation of Glyphis was low, being less than 1% of the total shark captures historically and 0.002 sharks 50 m net hour-1 in Weipa 2005. The size range captured was 1000-1800 mm total length historically and 705-1200 mm total length from Weipa 2005, with none recorded as sexually mature. Diagnostic characteristics of the Weipa specimens, identified as Glyphis sp. A, were: lower jaw teeth protruding and "spear-like"; second dorsal fin greater than half the height of the first dorsal fin; the snout relatively short and fleshy in the lateral view; pectoral fin ventral surface black in colouration; the precaudal vertebral count between 118 and 123; and the total vertebral count between 204 and 209.

Let’s agree: Jerry Brown deserves real praise for his role as a first-generation climate leader. As California’s governor, he helped shepherd the state to a place near the top of the green league standings, by reducing the demand for energy and producing more of that energy with renewables.
But let’s add: Global warming is a timed test, one that now demands stronger responses. And the governor is flunking that test. Rare are the politicians who manage to stay ahead of an issue—usually they stick with the strategies and talking points that served them well initially. Yes, it seems unfair to rag on Brown for losing track of the plot—but boy, would it be nice if he proved the exception to the rule and used the final months of his governorship to help the world move to the next stage of the climate fight.
Brown worked hard to cut energy use and to increase the use of solar panels. But at least since the start of the battle over the Keystone XL pipeline about a decade ago, environmentalists have added a new key strategy: To have any hope of meeting global targets, we also need to keep coal, oil, and gas in the ground. That’s why every new mine, well, pipeline, and terminal gets fought. Since California is a major oil-producing state, activists asked Brown to play a part, by beginning to phase out the routine granting of permits for new wells. (Thus far in his tenure, Brown’s administration has approved about 20,000 of them. Offshore, where he has refused to close down existing leases, Sacramento has permitted four times more wells than the federal government has allowed in the deeper waters it controls.)
This is not a particularly radical idea anymore. Barack Obama, when he vetoed the Keystone project in 2015, noted: “If we’re gonna prevent large parts of this Earth from becoming not only inhospitable but uninhabitable in our lifetimes, we’re gonna have to keep some fossil fuels in the ground.” French President Emmanuel Macron announced in 2017 that there would be no new oil or gas exploration in his country’s territories. Earlier this year, Jacinda Ardern, the bold new prime minister of New Zealand, banned all off- shore oil and gas exploration around the island nation: “Transitions have to start somewhere,” she said.
But not, apparently, in California, where the governor is roughly one generation older than Obama, and two ahead of Macron and Arden. In fact, every time the subject has come up, Brown has sounded testy, off his game—not even able to keep up with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who banned fracking across the Empire State. A year ago, when an activist dared interrupt his speech to shout “Keep it in the ground!,” Brown’s reply was caught on video: “Let’s put you in the ground,” he said.
Now, in an interview with The Nation (see Mark Hertsgaard’s article in this issue), Brown relies on a combination of sophistry and slur. He somehow transforms the request for a gradual, managed phase-out of new oil-drilling permits into a demand that he “snap my fingers and eliminate all gasoline in all California gasoline stations.” And if he did that, he continues, “what would happen? Revolution? Killings? Shootings?” The absurdity of this straw-man scenario only proves his unwillingness to lift a finger against the oil companies that have poured millions into his campaigns.
Brown also adopts a favorite talking point of the Canadian tar-sands industry: Stop the flow of our filthy oil and we’ll just end up buying it elsewhere. But the most thorough study of phasing out California’s oil fields found that, even if it slightly raised the demand for foreign oil, the net result would be to cut total world emissions—in fact, at a rate on par with all of California’s other energy innovations.
Economic modeling aside, it’s pretty clear who the greatest beneficiary of halting new oil production in California would be: Californians of color, who overwhelmingly inhabit the neighborhoods where Brown permits oil wells. That’s why so many environmental-justice groups have come together to demand action: more than 800 signed on to a letter this summer asking him to take action, and they’ll be leading a massive march through San Francisco on September 8 to demand he take action.
Those horrors add up to a compelling truth: The steps that first-generation leaders like Brown have taken are too small to meet the demands of the moment. Yes, Brown is standing up to President Trump, and yes, he’s done more than other governors have. But when it comes to climate change, it’s physics that we must measure ourselves against—and by that standard, we’re losing.
Brown insists that he can’t do more: “We’ve got a lot of elements in the political landscape that in a free society we have to deal with.” But in this case, that’s not true: He could simply stop issuing new permits. If he did, the fossil-fuel industry would kick and fuss, but it does that all the time anyway—at the moment, for instance, they’re trying to cut the state’s gas tax. They need to be fought, not feared.
And if he chooses, Brown could fight them with more power than any other politician on the planet. He’s got a state filled with engineers who are pointing the way toward the future, and with citizens who support real action. (Hispanic Americans show up in every poll as caring more about climate change than anyone else. Leaders like the state senate president emeritus Kevin de Leon, currently fighting for a 100 percent renewable-energy bill without any help from Brown, make that statistic very real.) And Brown is 80 years old, never running for office again, and in no further need of oil money.
One would hope this would free him to act—even a limited announcement that he would phase out drilling within 2,500 feet of schools, hospitals, and homes would be a real start, one that would win him deserved acclaim. But given the defensiveness that his interview reveals, perhaps we should be prepared to honor him as a pioneer in the early stages of this fight—not as a leader in its current and future battles.

Palmist is excited to present 12PALM07, the 7th in our series of limited split 12”s, which features New York’s Dustin Wong and London’s Gentle Friendly, both dedicated to pulling together a diverse range of influences whilst simultaneously committed to creating cohesive statements with their releases.
Dustin Wong, like many of us, dove into the world of music and art as an unhappy youth looking to rebel against certain ideals and “absolute truths” that contrasted his own beliefs. A twisting path of punk discovery and a growing respect for sonic visionaries like Jimi Hendrix, Brian Wilson, John Fahey, and Brian Eno led Dustin to further pursue his muse. He eventually wound up at the Maryland Institute College of Art, where he met and co-founded the critically acclaimed band Ponytail. In addition to his film studies, Dustin was also a founding member of Ecstatic Sunshine, whose music hinted more at the direction he would eventually take in this his solo debut.
On August 18th 2009 the proposition of playing a solo show was set before him by a friend. Dustin didn’t have any material to perform, and had never before performed solo. Excited by the proposition, he sat down and started writing what would become the first 15 minutes of Infinite Love. Taking inspiration from something John Fahey once said, “I was playing guitar but I heard an orchestra in my head. So I was really composing for a full orchestra”, Dustin was deeply moved and inspired by this way of thinking about the creative process. It had a profound effect on his working with one instrument on many melodic and literal layers as well as emotional ones. Working with a simple assembly of pedals: an octave, distortion, loop, envelope filter, and a couple of delays, Dustin began to take this idea and make it his own.
In most cases his compositions start with a simple repeating melody. Dustin slowly fills the space between each note with layered and looped guitar phrases, and continues to build on this pattern until his “orchestra” fully blooms. While the textures vary greatly, the sound never becomes a cacophony, but rather a delicate web-like base to suspend his various melodic lines from. The looped layers are then further manipulated via the pedals to have an evolving set of meter and timbres for the aural narrative. The only instrument apart from guitar is a sparingly used drum machine.
For Infinite Love (a reference to a psychedelic experience of Dustin’s), he wanted to focus on the potential of an actual album and the journey from beginning to end. This journey or musical process is increasingly being lost in the digital era, where often the focus is on tracks or collections of tracks. To highlight that journey, Infinite Love is presented as a double album, each with the same opening and different paths to the final codas. It is the listener’s choice which path to take. Dustin puts it thus, “In Infinite Love the listener gets two choices. I think of them as twins, a brother and a sister, living their lives, then reuniting.”
For his split with Gentle Friendly, Dustin once again explored this idea of a musical journey and used his side of the 12” to house a concept that corresponds with parts of the human body, as he explains.
“Ten fingers, two hands, two feet and one head. I imagined these four parts as kinds of gestures that one can express through the vehicles of our body. The gestures of 10 fingers could be a flirtatious, fluttering wave, two hands could be a construction of a sand castle with a rich imaginative history, two feet in a pair of tap shoes and the head that dreams.”
Gentle Friendly are a duo from London, comprised of David Morris and Richard Manber, who have a penchant for circular melodies, tidal fuzz and rapid junked rhythms. With an austere setup of Casio keyboard, vocals and drums (sometimes electronic) the band push against the pop boundary, trapping their songs on record like a continuous sun-warped field recording.
2009 saw Gentle Friendly release their debut album ‘Ride Slow’ to critical acclaim – Uncut considered “No Age, Ponytail and Health as spiritual kin”, whilst Pitchfork even cited Clipse and Lil Wayne as influences on the band. Since then Gentle Friendly have remodelled and rebuilt their sound into a stronger beast at their home studio called Deep House, a house they share with other leftfield lo-fi artists, Echo Lake, Munch Munch and others, all of whom Gentle Friendly credit with helping to shape and influence their sound. The incredible EP ‘Rrrrrrr’, released by Upset The Rhythm was the first fruit to fall from the tree, with its seven tracks washing the band’s insistent prism punk alongside more tender, filmic textures.
For their most recent release, Gentle Friendly have developed and honed this sound, whilst still demonstrating their strong commitment to pushing their capabilities almost to breaking point. Lead song from their side ‘The Shake Up’ demonstrates this – its taut rhythms and syncopated bass hook pushing the song in a relentless manner as Morris occasionally struggles to fit the syllables of his lyrics into one line, whilst all the time demonstrating a remarkable pop sensibility. It is also clear from listening to this side that Gentle Friendly have achieved the rare feat of making a sound that is instantly recognizable as their own, forged from a rich tapestry of influences and a particular brand of ‘Future Englishness’. Evidence of the band’s continued search for inspiration in unusual areas is found on their side of the split with the integration of ‘Number Stations’, radio stations that just broadcast these repeating sequences, as David Morris explains. “You tune in and get a looped series of tones, or a phrase, or just a voice counting to ten over and over again, which is how they got the name.

“During All Souls Day, Catholics are encouraged to visit cemeteries to gain plenary indulgences for our loved ones who are no longer with us. Catholics cemeteries are also consecrated grounds. Yes, we have our memento mori thoughts in cemeteries and we mourn our losses, but there is also hope. (1 Thess 4:13-18)
We pray for the Poor Souls, hoping that our prayers, Masses, and indulgences get them out of Purgatory quicker. That means that we provide hope to get them to Heaven sooner, so they can finally spend eternity with God. Not only this, but we can also hope that someday they will be in Heaven, praying for us. Furthermore, we hope that future generations will be doing the same for our souls when we’ve passed on.
Are you interested in receiving an indulgence – either plenary or partial – for the soul of a loved one while visiting their grave? Here is what you can do.
5. Prayers for the Supreme Pontiff (prayed either 20 days before or go 20 days after the indulgence act) or/and his intentions.
1. Visit a cemetery between November 1st and 8th and say a mental prayer for the poor souls; you can do this once a day, every day during the 8 days.
2. On November 2nd, you can visit a church or an oratory where they’re praying an Our Father and the Creed.
If you can’t get a plenary indulgence, a partial indulgence can be obtained at any time by simply visiting a cemetery and praying for the poor souls in Purgatory with this prayer:
Eternal rest grant to them, O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them. May the rest in peace. Amen.
If you don’t have anyone to pray for, you can always pray and ask God to apply the indulgence for a poor soul who has no one praying for them. As Venerable Fulton Sheen once said, when we die, those souls we’ve prayed for—even people who we never met on earth—will be “coming toward us and thanking us. We will ask who they are and they will say: ‘A poor soul you prayed for in purgatory.’”

Chesterton, "I want a laity, not arrogant, not rash in speech, not disputatious, but men and women who know their religion, who enter into it, who know just where they stand, who know what they hold and what they do not, and who know their creed so well that they can give an account of it."- Bl John Henry Newman, Cong.

And this I believe is heard.” -GM Hopkins, SJ, "Only God knows the good that can come about by reading one good Catholic book." — St. John Bosco, "Why don't you try explaining it to them?" – cf St Peter Canisius, SJ, Doctor of the Church, Doctor of the Catechism, "Already I was coming to appreciate that often apologetics consists of offering theological eye glasses of varying prescriptions to an inquirer. Only one prescription will give him clear sight; all the others will give him at best indistinct sight. What you want him to see—some particular truth of the Faith—will remain fuzzy to him until you come across theological eye glasses that precisely compensate for his particular defect of vision." -Karl Keating, "The more perfectly we know God, the more perfectly we love Him." -St Thomas Aquinas, OP, ST, I-II,67,6 ad 3, “But always when I was without a book, my soul would at once become disturbed, and my thoughts wandered." —St. Teresa of Avila, "Let those who think I have said too little and those who think I have said too much, forgive me; and let those who think I have said just enough thank God with me." –St. Augustine

I lost a lot of weight in the beginning, all my pregnancy weight and then a little more, but not enough to put me out of a healthy BMI - just to take the chunk off that I had accumulated before pregnancy. Now I am maintainng juts fine. She is growing hearty and healthy, so I know my milk's working! We have no plans on stopping nursing anytime soon - probably we will just let her wean when she's ready, but I am going to give her a banana tonight and see what she does with it.
Anyway, I thought I'd share this here, since you all are the most likley ones to be interested in breastfeeding. I wasn't a successful nurser with my son, so this is really importnant to me!
here she is with her dad - who would kill me if he knew I put his pic on here, so don't tell - but aren't they cute?? <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-smile.gif" border="0">
Yes, they are! <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0"> Congrats! I went 6 months, but I was pumping, so between me beginning to have a hard time keeping up, and a round of pancreatitis, she had to go on formula for the next 6 months. I'm so happy for you!
Good for you! I am glad you have an enjoyable experience this time around. I also wont whisper to your guy that the pic is up, but I have to agree that they are BOTH adorable!
Congratulations I am very happy to hear someone else as happy abotu BF as me! I dont plan on introducing food until 6 months either, some at my daycare are eating food at 3 months! YIKES. I just love BF and I think it is such a wonderful bond. DD is 3.5 months and even retuirnig to work BF still going well adn I have about 4 weeks worth of milk stocked in freezer should somethign happen so I am happy about that.
Alexa and I had a really hard time breastfeeding but once we got the hang of it, we had a wonderful breastfeeding experience until she weaned at 12 months.
yup. I really like it, not just for the breastfeeding part, but it was nice to meet like-minded mommas in my area.
cute cute cute (both of them) and congratulations on successful breastfeeding. I nursed with my children for a long time: 18 months, 26 months and 35 months .....
35 months, holy cow! can I ask why? Is there a benefit or was it hard to wean, sorry I just never heard anyone go past 18, well in US I guess it is different in other countries. My friend lives in Kuwait and egypt and says that there they dont believ ein birth control so they breastfeed for 2 years, no longer per Koran, so all their kids are about 3 years apart! <img src="i/expressions/face-icon-small-wink.gif" border="0">

my sister nursed her youngest for 3 years, and a woman in my LLL group nursed her TWINS for 4 years! I don't know what the nutritional value is after 2 years, though I am sure it doesn't hurt, but I think emotionally kids get attached and it's hard to take that away - think of a blankie or loved stuffed animal. There is a lot of info on child led weaning. If you click on the "cool wool baby" link in my siggy and then scroll down a few days, in the post "Mom's Breastraunt" is a lot of info about extended nursing, including a video of a mom still nursing her eight year old! I dont think I'll nurse that long, but I am hoping to nurse as long as the baby and I both still enjoy it (I can't imagine I'd enjoy it when she was 8!)
She received a lot of heat from family/friends about it, but my niece was one of the healthiest kids around.
Nicole, we nursed that long because we liked it. Breastfeeding was a wonderful gift to give to my children and myself. I got some comments from people, but it was so long ago (Cara is now 20) that the comments are insignificant compared to the fond memories. When I was nursing my kids we thought my health problems were from allergies (ha!) so I took special precuations when introducing solid food. I was a grad student when Cara was a baby, and very busy, so couldn't focus on gradual and intentional introduction of foods - she really didn't eat solid foods until she was 9 months old (I got lots of comments about that - aren't you EVER going to feed that baby real food?!) ;she was the healthiest of our three children.

How do I determine that this time a signal is a true one and won't be gone/cancelled as the time moves on?
that's what filtering the signals is all about. In case you are using MACD or EMA cross or Stochastic - you must be familiar with their TRICKS, when one hour you can see lines crossing and then another hour they uncross...
2. Add indicator that does not use lines cross or signals that may change itself over the time, for example, Parabolic SAR (it can still change its dot, but it is rather an exception than a rule).
Then also I draw trend lines and if, for example I want to enter on the trend change, I wait for my trend line to be crossed.
In the meantime I also monitor my indicators, like Stochastic and EMAs. Then when I've got my trend line breached and my indicators tell me to enter, I'm confident my chances to win are high.
To avoid false signals on the trend change never trade a single top or a single bottom. Patience and cool head should be your friends while you wait for a retest and appearance of the second top or bottom.
Once you've got double top or double bottom pattern - go for it as it is the best filtered entry ever. Plus your stops will be maximum tight - just slightly away from the tops or bottoms.
Lastly, Patience! Patience!! Patience!!! Most of us newbies are guilty of backing out too early because of fear later to see our strategy eventually coming to win. Always give your system a little of patience that will be in harmony with your money management before you conclude it's a false signal.
beleive its that simple though. There has to be some negative as to why the developers didnt want this capacity out of the box unless its a marketing ploy.They are going to release Notepad as one
of the editing tools and promote how you can "mod" the game to add more than 5 players. More like they will tell you you can &qu
ot;mod" the game with notepad, but require you to use a notpad plug-in that only the development team is licensed to use.

Q) hello,child support of Florida says i owe over 6,000 in child support but that’s incorrect i have my paystubs to prove that but they want to suspend my license,i cant get in touch with anyone from child support to have them correct this mistake which happens every year around tax time like someone isnt doing there job.It’s a shame you have to suffer when your paying the child support because someone on that end is not getting the right information please anyone from child support please help.
A) If you disagree with the amount of child support payments you owe, you should ask for a hearing. Bring all pay-stub, receipt and information with you to prove child support payments you have made and how much you should owe.

The structure carved into the rock has been worked by a 1000 year old community that has left few historical traces.
Guyaju ruins are a group of houses carved out of rock. The ruins are known as the largest site of Northern China showing ancient cave dwellings.
They are located in the village Dongmenying, near the city of Zhangshanying, in Yanqing County, north of Beijing municipality. The structure carved into the rock has been worked by a 1000 year old community that has left few historical traces. Archaeologists believe that the site dates back to the last period of the Tang Dynasty and the beginning of the Liao Dinasty. The work is attributed to a Mongolic steppe tribe called Kumo Xi.
When the Tang dynasty collapsed the Xi rose in rebellion in 847, and were subsequently and disastrously defeated by Zhang Zhongwu. The Xi disbanded and they were betrayed and absorbed by the Khitan people and they eventually established the Liao Dynasty in 907. However, it is believed that when this tribe was on the run, they built here their home and they lived here for 30 years. The ruins look like a fortress in a canyon.
The site is composed by 117 caves and more than 350 rooms and halls, scattered along the northern, southern and eastern slopes. Most of the caves has three rooms, with a small living room and a warehouse. Some homes are two-storey and they are connected by carved stairs, stone bridges and steps. Every room has its defined purpose: communal events, royal quarters, religious rituals, cooking, storage, livestock, living, etc. It has its own drainage and water storage system.
Rooms are of different shapes and size: rectangular, round or square, the largest is 20 meters long, while the smaller 3 meters. Average room height is 1.6/1.7 meters, the tallest 1.8 m. For this reason scholars assume the community that resided there could not exceed 1.4/1.5 meters in height. Archaeologists have speculated that the proportions of the space may indicate that the houses had been built for a community of people of small stature. In the literature there are no documents of this curious place. However there is a reference to a family named Xi living in the northeast of China; the family was later betrayed and for this reason the clan moved to the area, which is now known as the County of Yanqing.
They lived in the mountains, but we don’t know the exact location. Some speculate the reason for their run forced them to secrecy and to build their own fortified settlement in a hidden mountain. The story of this family reminds the later history of the Kumo Xi, for this reason it’s possible the Xi family was the Kumo Xi people on the run. There are other speculations about the origin of this site: some says it was built during Tang Dynasty and it was a large granary built and funded by the government. Others think it was a garrison built during the Han Dyansty.
This site is still an enigma as we don’t have enough historical evidence to tell the origins of this archeological site.

Considering the popular saying by Chairman Mao “If you don’t get to the Great Wall you’re not a good man.” (不到长城非好汉。) we take you on a tour to the magnificent eighth wonder of the world.
Divided into sections, the most preserved and best to cover the beauty of the wall is the Great Wall at Mutianyu.
Getting engulfed into the least crowded, richly architected and with the most watchtower section of the Great Wall.
An easy visit with the option of taking a cable car or a toboggan. Avoiding the tiring 800 steps hike.
A well informed and experienced guide will be waiting in the lobby with a placard with your name. A 1 ½ hour drive to Mutianyu section of the Great Wall, a short rest there and a delicious lunch to munch on from the Xinshuangquan restaurant.
Before the tour date: Research well regarding the tour details (guide, driver, pick-up time). The site is https://www.trippest.com/track-your-trip.html, the information is updated 24 hours prior to the tour. In case of any query contact the trip advisor.
A private airport transfer cane be provided at a cost of USD $18 p/p. Click here to book the transfer.
Done with the lunch, we arrive at the Great Wall, the China Highlights Kiosk will provide the hiking pole and drinking water. The shuttle shall then take you to the Mutianyu tourist area.
On reaching the tourist area, you have two options to travel up or down the wall, either a toboggan/chairlift or a cable car (both are round way). The choice is yours as the chairlift and cable car takes 7 minutes while the climbing the steps takes 45 minutes.
The cable car descends and ascends from the 14th watchtower. The walk east from here to the 23rd tower takes you to the most beautiful part of the Great Wall’s Mutianyu section. The chairlift goes up to the 6th tower, with a challenging hike from there to the 23rd tower. Depending on the physical condition, many customers return from the 14th tower back to the 6th. A fun filled toboggan ride down the mountain is also option. For single way trip, an extra CNY80 is to be paid by you personally.
From the foot of the Great Wall a shuttle will transport you to the parking lot. A back to hotel transfer shall be by about 6:00 pm.
In case you want to leave Beijing after the day tour, remember to checkout from the hotel before departing. The estimated time to complete the checkout is 10 to 20 minutes. For a quick transfer to the airport it is better to leave the luggage in the tour car. An approximate 1 hour is required to reach the airport. The airport check-in time is 1.5 hours before a domestic flight and 2.5 hours in case of an international one. Arrangement scan be made to your ease if you inform us of the departure time and update the guide as well. The price is USD $18 per person as we provide private airport / train station to transfer.

I thoroughly enjoy a good cup of coffee in the morning. This sounds like a great outfit to buy from.
NFL... Dang, I love football, but haven't watched a game since this silly protest stuff started this season. My wife is nuts about the NFL, something she inherited from her father. We used to really enjoy watching the games together and sometimes I'd buy her NFL "stuff" like a jersey, ear-rings or something.
I heard today that only three players in the entire NFL "took a knee" this past weekend. That's good. That's real good.
I have not watched a single NFL game since this started. The idiot Commissioner should never have allowed it to get started in the first place. If you can't drop to a knee in prayer, you certainly should not be allowed to kneel for our National Anthem.
I only watched the very last World Series game this year as well. I just have lost interest in most of the major league sports and with baseball, it started with their strike years ago. Millions of dollar contracts and they have to whine and whimper about nothing.
Pro sports all suck seaweed, all of them have been off my list since they were all striking back in I think, the 90s. Every player and every owner fighting for their next 4 or 5th and in some cases 40th or 50th million dollars, all the while locking out the parking lot attendant, the hot dog and beer man, security, janitors, etc, most of whom don't have a real pot to wiz in and need the job to support their families. Nope have not watched a game since.
Besides if you to watch a great game, go to see your Local HS team play! They play with a 1000 times more heart than any pro does now. All pros do now is whine and act like idiots.
Lord, please let it be a 1 shot, 1 kill day 10 yds uphill from a spot that my tailgate fits under. Thank you!

Depends on the nature of the claim, if you strained your back while 'servicing' a customer in the changing room but no one believes you you might have to stage a reenactment.
I re-read a pair of short stories I wrote about two weeks ago. I knew they needed work because my gag reflex activated at some point of both stories. A total of ~10,000 words and after I was done deleting the awful portions, there was left than ~4,000 words remaining between the two of them. I've also begun to notice most of my stories read exactly the same, which is probably an artifact of reading and re-reading my own stuff at the expense of other people's stories. The Fabulous Futa contest was good for forcing me to engage with a variety of pieces, including stuff I flat didn't like, but that came too late for this last pair.
I suppose this post is off-topic, since I didn't discover anything except that I'm not as good as I wish I was when it comes to wordsmithing.
Reading other peoples stuff is the absolute best way to teach yourself things that work and don't work. I wrote on my own for years, and really struggled to make progress at the craft of it. It wasn't until I started posting my first story and looking around that my style started to evolve.
I attempted to work on my personal project for an hour and got nowhere. So I tried forging ahead in Captain Coxwells next adventure. Got nowhere. Played Destiny with no pants on for the rest of the day. Does that count?

I'd call that a discovery; you can't fix what you don't know is broken. Being an editor, I wish all writers were that self-aware.
Up late trying to work on a commission. I think I burned myself out this past week, but getting back into the swing of things now.
Decided to splurge and installed a new default theme, too much work to create something decent. In theory it's also mobile ready. Gonna try it out for the next few days see if it works. Some minor details pending like the logo.
Then in accepting Z, you affirm to yourself that the rest of them must also be true because Z is true.
In this text there is also the desiderata "Qualitative Correspondence with common sense". This is often what is lacking. To quote yet another great movie quote "Is stupid. Is stupidest theory I ever heard." At the end of the day the theory has to not sound ridiculous when compared with common sense.
Scientists are avoiding "common sense" since quantum mechanics emerged around 80 years ago as experimental observations proved them wrong.
When I teach to undergraduates I usually tell these phrases quickly to show that common sense should not be followed:
"Every electron in your atoms in your body has a non-zero probability to be found in any corner of the universe" (Schrödinger equation and molecular orbitals)
In the end, I wouldn't be using my laptop today to write this post if some people just stopped at declaring the Heisenberg principle stupid. And trust me, in common sense, it is darn stupid.
All we do is design experiments that would make the theory collapse, just one little tiny detail that will make the Jenga tower go down.
80 years later, it's still there and kicking, so we use it. We will use it to describe the world around us until a new theory will come out that will describe the world even better. This is science.

In the case of probability theory as extended logic it was your use of absolutist statements like "proof", "fact" and "speculation" in an area where they don't apply (epistemology/science as opposed to the public categorization of scientific findings). Hell, even "exist" becomes too vague when the topic is virtual particles (there are a number of possible meanings of "exist" at that level corresponding to separate intuitions).
In this instance if you take terms A, B, C, D, E, F, G etc until Z and you build each one on the next what you get is a tower of acceptance as true due to perceived extreme plausibility. Then in accepting Z, you affirm to yourself that the rest of them must also be true because Z is true.
Probing at the bottom bits of the tower is what undergrads are encouraged to do (I often challenged my professors after class with possible alternatives to the theory being built and every time they both recognized the theory I proposed and gave a summary of why it ended up discredited and where I could find out more details).

If scientists are trying to disprove what they think then why do people still believe in time dilation?
The classic example of how this works (moving parallel lines with the a signal bouncing between them) does not show time dilating but rather shows that the medium through which the signal moves is not moving along with the instrument used to measure the dilation. This does show that the speed of light didn't change since the light took longer to catch up with the instrument. Or do you think air is the medium of light?
What people keep confusing is that the signal is not time. It's only a signal being used to try to measure time.
I'm not trying to say that all these wonderful inventions don't exist that people have come up with but I just don't believe they fully understand why they work. I don't have to understand how a shovel is put together for it to be useful.
Oh and the cat isn't alive and dead, he's alive OR dead. The first is rediculous where the second is uncertianty.
Vachtra wrote: If scientists are trying to disprove what they think then why do people still believe in time dilation?
Time dilation is nothing exotic, it is just a result of how things work. You do realise that GPS satellites make corrections for time dilation in order to keep themselves synchronized with the surface of our planet? But than again, maybe this is one of the 'common sense is not helping you' cases.
They aren't making corrections for time dilation. They are making corrections for variations in the signals they are receiving which people have called time dilation. The same thing is happening on the satellites as happens in the experiment. The outcome of the experiment is correct and useful in application, just the interpretation is incorrect.
It has been stated that you can't go faster than the speed of light. If time dilation exists then you could in fact not go faster than approximately 70% the speed of light since at this point you would feel you were going, due to time dilation, almost at the speed of light.
Another point being the claim of what time dilation affects. Consistently it is applied to a moving object saying that relative movement makes the dilation. Since everything is moving, all movement must be accounted for. This is clear when we look at not only two but multiple objects.
If a plane takes off then it should have time dilation affecting it relative to the earth. If a passenger then jumps out of said plane he would have time dilation relative to the plane which is relative to the earth. This would only increase dilations by compounding them. Even after the person landed on the ground his dilation would be from the point he accelerated from the plane. Do this enough times and the man would be dilated so much he would be out of sync with society. This sounds ridiculous I know but that's because it is. This is the model we're presented with though, they just haven't drawn it out to it's logical conclusion.
If on the other hand time dilation is due to differing vectors of objects, which is what would fix this problem, then another problem comes up. the leaving and returning vectors would cancel each other out and there would be no perceived time dilation. This is because earth's vector would be taken into account and when earth's vector had a greater magnitude the object would be experiencing time faster rather than slower.

Then how do you explain the results of two atomic clocks, being confirmed to run at the exact same speed, where one was taken on a fast flying air plane. When the plane returned, the clock that took to the skies was slower by exactly the amount Einstein's equations predicted?
This is because his predictions were good calculations but not about time. They are applicable to the movement of electromagnetic signals.
These clocks were tested on the ground and on the ground they work exactly the same. When one was sped up it was being flown through earth's magnetic field and thus altered it's reliability.
Vachtra wrote: This is because his predictions were good calculations but not about time. They are applicable to the movement of electromagnetic signals.
Then how do you explain the results of two atomic clocks, being confirmed to run at the exact same speed, where one was placed 33 cm above the other. Where the clock placed further away from the ground runs faster than the one placed closer to the ground? (Again, by exactly the amount Einstein's equations predicted) as measured by NIST and described in the Sept. 24, 2010 issue of Science?
Again it isn't time that is changing, merely the instrument. The calculations are still valid but in reference to the signals being observed.
A second is not really defined by a clock. A clock measures it's own movement and time can then be estimated by the observation.
I am so glad I started this thread. *Jay2Jay grabs a handful of popcorn and eats it, then drinks from his coke*
I hope that's mexican coke. The real sugar tastes so much better. Someone should really give the guy who decided to use corn syrup a good talking to.
Time dilation is simply the name (do you have a better one?) given to the observation that an object accelerated up to a fast speed (relative to observer) then decelerated will have it's clocks (and everything else!) slowed by a constant now. Special Relativity provides a nice and simple model for this and other phenomena.
To be honest physics cares very little for interpretations, who cares whether you ascribe to Copenhagen or Many Worlds? Theories are all about the hard math and predictions, what particular metaphors you use to understand these concepts are quite simply irrelevant. Calling one metaphor correct and another incorrect is Not Even Wrong!
I didn't take any relativity course at university, but did you know the dependency list for Mathematics for General Relativity at MIT is: Differential Equations, Single Variable Calculus, Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, Electromagnetism II, Physics III
Even MIT's Special (not General) Relativity lecture notes say "Many of you may think you know it all from books, other courses, ect. Don't get lulled into a false sense of security! This may be your first real departure from intuitive physics."
Saying the state is either a|0> or b|1> gives different results mathematically to saying the state is a|0>+b|1>. Experiments have determined that the former is wrong and the latter is the case.
The best metaphor for this in terms understandable to the layman is NOT "the cat is either alive or dead", it's "the cat is alive and dead".
Our common sense is excellent (unsurpassed even by our best AIs and algorithms) in the domain it was built for (whether by evolution or deity), which is at the metre, second-to-decade and second per metre scale. The further we got from this domain the more likely it was that we'd encounter something unintuitive and eventually we did (several such things in fact).
In fact, we eventually encountered things that our imagination simply couldn't model, every attempt to visualize or use metaphors just failed to encapsulate the entirety of the model (and thus failed to anticipate the observed results) and in the end what was actually used was purely mathematical constructs.
Vachtra wrote: It has been stated that you can't go faster than the speed of light. If time dilation exists then you could in fact not go faster than approximately 70% the speed of light since at this point you would feel you were going, due to time dilation, almost at the speed of light.
If a passenger then jumps out of said plane he would have time dilation relative to the plane which is relative to the earth. This would only increase dilations by compounding them. Even after the person landed on the ground his dilation would be from the point he accelerated from the plane.
Until this point I still considered it possible you did, in fact, understand the subject matter and there had just been a repeated series of miscommunications...
These quotes are just wrong and show a complete lack of understanding of what Special Relativity actually says. You seem to have no understanding of what a reference frame actually is. Acceleration matters and changes reference frames. Reference frames do not necessarily agree about other reference frames.
You're attacking a strawman because you don't understand relativity. This can be corrected fairly easily, there are textbooks on Special Relativity and MIT's Open Courseware has lecture notes and handouts available for free (you can go through them in less than a day, though it wouldn't be enough to let you take the exam).
"Brilliant people have tried and failed to disprove these theories for generations. No matter how brilliant I think myself, it would be unlikely for me to have found a simple proof where everyone else had failed."
The term "time dilation" asserts that time is not constant and is relative between objects. "Signal dilation" would be appropriate.
Um, what's a Discord. The site says voice and text chat thingy, so another IRC with voice as well? I don't want to download apps on other people's computers without a bit more info. TIA.
Its web or client based. You sign up and can join. It does both text, video, and audio. Its for games and games.
It's like IRC, but more modern. Some people like the design and extra features, while others prefer IRC for being simpler and lighter weight.
On September 7, 1968, John Bonham, John Paul Jones, Jimmy Page, and Robert Plant first took the stage together in Gladsaxe, Denmark. Then billed as “The New Yardbirds,” the band would assemble in the studio for the first time later that month to start recording their debut album as Led Zeppelin, and rock ‘n’ roll would never be the same again. Before the band’s 50th Anniversary celebration officially begins in September, Led Zeppelin will continue their reissue campaign with a new edition of their celebrated live album HOW THE WEST WAS WON, originally released in 2003, featuring newly remastered audio, which was done under the supervision of Jimmy Page. Details of additional Led Zeppelin 50th Anniversary releases and events will be announced later this year.
HOW THE WEST WAS WON will be released on March 23 in multiple formats from Atlantic/Swan Song, including the first ever vinyl and Blu-ray Audio editions (with the Blu-ray containing hi-res 5.1 surround sound).
o A book filled with rare and previously unpublished photos of the band at each of the concert locations, plus memorabilia and ephemera.
o High-quality print of the original album cover, the first 30,000 of which will be individually numbered.
Originally released in 2003, HOW THE WEST WAS WON highlights the best performances from Led Zeppelin’s legendary concerts at the Los Angeles Forum and Long Beach Arena on June 25 and 27, 1972. Melded together and sequenced to replicate a single concert from beginning to end, the three-CD and four-LP collections capture the band at the height of its formidable powers. Standouts include a 25-plus minute version of “Dazed And Confused” and a 21-minute medley based around “Whole Lotta Love.” The performances also capture the band introducing songs from its then-unreleased album Houses Of The Holy, which would be released nine months later.
So yeah, not the most exciting news but the real 50th Anniversary goods will be coming later in the year.
Seriously though, why is this even being released if there are no missing tracks added and WLL is actually reduced?? What is the point? $$? (Rhetorical question, I know)
I'm happy to get this on vinyl and hopefully an upgraded 5.1 on the Blu-ray. The 5.1 on the dvd was underwhelming.
Not surprised about this release but won't be getting it as no extra tracks and there are a few JP could include without having to pay residual fees for cover songs. Those include TY, CB and Tangerine. Who knows things could change but probably not. Looking forward to the Fall when hoping some great stuff will be released!
This actually has me angered. I want to give the lads my money, but not for something that is musically inferior than what we already have.
Ridiculous! I'm not buying any more of this repackaging! I bought every album on record, I bought the CD releases, the "box set", and the "deluxe" remasters!
I thought the 2 minute cut in WLL was because the album will be appearing on vinyl for the first time and they didn't want a 23+ minute-long side (along with that, I'd assumed Dazed would be split between two sides, as it is on the 2007 reissue of The Song Remains the Same).
But based on an LP-version tracklisting that's shown up at Bull Moose - http://www.bullmoose.com/p/26761137/led-zeppelin-how-the-west-was-won-4-180-gram-vinyl-lps - it looks like I was wrong. The cut in WLL must be for royalty reasons; Dazed is on one side; and Page has reordered the setlist for the vinyl version to make it all work, moving What Is and What Should Never Be and Dancing Days earlier.
I don't know what changed between 2003 and now, but apparently something must have changed with the rights holder to "Mary Lou" (if that is indeed the bit that is cut).
I'd say maybe let's hold our breath to 2022 and just maybe there might be a 50th Anniversary for the 1972 shows...but we'd all be dead holding our breath that long.
Who knows..maybe by 2022 we'll have Amazon drone delivery and people can also buy Stem-Cell human recovery kits.
To not include CB, Tangerine and TY on this release is completely fatuous, unless the tapes are damaged.
I'm really torn on this. My missus got me my first ever vinyl for Christmas - Physical Graffiti (Not even the deluxe one, just the standard double LP) as I mentioned to her it would be nice to get into vinyl but alas, an incredibly expensive hobby. She must not have heard that last bit. LOL.
So I have an LP, but no record player. But now it's begun, and I do plan on getting more. I plan on eventually getting all the Super Deluxe reissues of the studio albums over time. (I assume they will be available somewhere) So here is my chance to get my first super deluxe. Which will remain unopened (I'll also get the deluxe CD so I have something to throw on) until I also invest in some decent quality audio gear.
But really not sure. I am by no means a rich man. But I do dream of having a killer Zep collection...
I suppose I might pick it up eventually if the remastering is clearly superior to the existing sound.
Hi - The links are auto-generated based on your IP address location. Some of the countries took longer to setup on Amazon etc. Let me know if it's still not working on your end.
I think something like this is a double edged sword. On the surface, it appears to be the same (minus two minutes) thing repackaged. But for the die hards, Page may bring a more authentic sound to the mix, which I would enjoy immensely. I don't even bother with HTWWW because the mix is so, I don't know, fake and overproduced.
Then again, Page's agent might have said "Hey Jimmy, the royalties we're paying on "Hello Mary Lou" is killing us. You think we should put out a "remaster" and cut it?"
This is like the greatest live album of all time. I, for one, welcome the new remaster, and can't wait to hear it on vinyl. Can't believe all these negative comments, but I guess I'm not surprised. Some people just love to nitpick, and focus on what isn't there instead of what is there.
This isn't a fair assessment. The 2003 release was brick-walled and the drums clipped--maybe that's been attenuated on this release. I'd hope so. But that is not enough of an incentive for me (and others) to buy something that is musically inferior to what came before.
I agree with your general point here. But at the same time, for a $20 bill it's more than worth it to me to get 148 out of the 150 minutes (about 99%) remastered with what I am betting will be better sound than the original 2003 mastering.
I'm of course going to hold on to my DVD-A set from 2003, but it will be nice to have the new version too.
Absolutely! I suspect the new mastering will easily beat the original - but how will it stack up against Winston's? That will be the more interesting (and fun) comparison.
I’ve heard from a source close to the band that there will also be a How the North was won - full DVD version of Iceland concert and How the South was Won - a complete DVD set of their Australian tour.
he also told me that after these albums go on sale, Page will announce his solo world tour and new album.

Marvel Comics has officially announced their new series All New Guardians of the Galaxy. The comic comes from writer Gerry Duggan (Deadpool, Nova), artist Aaron Kuder (Death of X), and colorist Ive Svorcina (Secret Wars).
The original character roster of Star-Lord, Rocket, Groot, Gamora and Drax are all set to return. There are a few interesting changes with some of the characters, such as Groot apparently being stuck in his tiny form with no one able to explain why he isn’t regenerating, Then there’s Drax the Destroyer, who is now Drax the Pacifist. According to CB:
The series will pick up some time after ‘Grounded,’ the final arc of the current Guardians of the Galaxy series. All-New Guardians of the Galaxy #1 kicks off with the Guardians on a job and embroiled in a war between two of the Elders of the Universe, the Collector and the Grandmaster.
“We want to put these guys into new cosmic situations. We’re right in the middle of a heist in the first issue. I think, even though they’re functioning well as a team, they’re each looking forward to handling their own business, so they might be feeling gravity’s pull apart. They have a lot going on individually and I’m really excited to explore that.
“Aaron and I have a really fun introduction to this team in the first issue cooked up, and we’ll see that they are handling this heist as best they can, that it’s complicated, and it gets very cosmic.”
“We have some mysteries brewing out in space. When our story picks up, Groot is small and doesn’t seem to be growing large. We don’t quite know why. The Guardians don’t know why. The readers won’t have very long to find that will be a problem moving forward, in a fun way, I hope.
“Drax is done destroying. Something has happened to him to that has made him leave his swords down. Drax is still Drax. He wants to destroy, he’s just holding back for now. It’s a fun turn for him as he struggles with pacifism like an alcoholic might struggle in a bar.
“For many years now we’ve heard about the Collector’s collection and how that’s the best collection of the galaxy, and it has the most valuable and unique and wondrous things. That’s true to a point, but the Grandmaster also has another collection. By giving the Collector a rival, we now have an opportunity to really make trouble for the Guardians. And so, this first arc is very much a war between the Collector and the Grandmaster over artifacts that they both want for their collection, and there can only be one winner. It feels right to open up in a big way with those amazing Marvel Universe cosmic entities. It’s going to be a lot of fun.
“The story begins as the team is mid-job. They’re initially hired by one side and then compromised. They each have their own reason for wanting a big score.
“The Guardians’ escape from that arc, too, is going to be something I don’t think anyone will see coming. It’s very Guardians.”
Make sure to click here to read the full interview, because this is just the tip of the iceberg. It sounds like it could be a fun and entertaining series to read! The comic will be released this May.

(4) Abdul Wahid bin Abdullah narrated from Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Rabah az-Zuhri from Ahmad bin Ali al-Himyari from al-Hasan bin Ayyoob from Abdul Kareem bin Amr al-Khath’ami from Iss’haq bin Jareer from Hijr bin Za’ida that Hamran bin A’yun had said:
He said: “The messenger of Allah has begotten me. I am the one, who avenge the blood. Allah does whatever He wills.”
He said: “You have known where to go. Your man is the one with the big abdomen and with dandruff in his head. He is the son of the imams. May Allah have mercy upon so-and-so!”4
The aim of the indigenous peoples and this project is development on a cultural basis, integrating technologies that are both modern and environmentally-friendly into their ways of life. Most important of all is conservation of the rainforest and its biological diversity as a living space for the next generation. Significant in this is the introduction of renewable energies for personal use and for productions to market. The model was prepared and developed in so-called sample communities of different indigenous peoples in Ecuador to later also make the results available to other indigenous communities in the Amazon region.
The project was divided into two phases whereby the first of these involved research and development (2002-2005) and the second training and production (2005-2009).
At the start of the project, three indigenous peoples, namely the Shuar, Achuar and Kichwa who dwell in the south-east of Ecuador, selected communities in which the project should be implemented and enhanced. These so-called sample communities comprise 8,000 Shuar, 5,000 Achuar and 15,000 Kichwa (a total of around 28,000 indigenous people) whose territories include approx. 20,000 square kilometres of untouched rainforest. After four years, the project was then extended to 120,000 inhabitants of the Ecuadorian Oriente, as well as made accessible to an unlimited number of forest communities in the Amazon Basin.
With the present brochure we wish to take a critical look at development of the REDD+ instrument and to present the alternative approaches of indigenous peoples dwelling in Amazonia.
The footballers of the Ecuadorian “Club Deportivo Sarayaku” have been raising awareness for the sustainable management of their forests through football. Now in the region’s professional championship league, the team is currently seeking financing for both the team and especially its message of preserving the Kawsak Sacha, the concept of “Living forest”, via crowdfunding
Friday, 12th of June in Bonn: Different interests of protection competing for forests as a resource and alternatives by indigenous peoples
Since many years Climate Alliance supports the Waiãpi who live in voluntary isolation in Brazil, Acre. Their culture and ways of life are under threat.
SAD detected 95 square kilometers of deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon in December 2014. That represented a 70% increase in relation to December 2013 when deforestation totaled 56 square kilometers.
New study says 55% of carbon in Amazonian indigenous territories and protected lands may be at risk.
Previous studies commissioned by the EU have shown that the EU has been leading the world in imports of ‘embodied deforestation’ in the form of agricultural and timber products. This study goes a step further, by showing that the EU is also one of the largest importers of products resulting from illegal deforestation.
Bradford, Roper, and Wong perform on a loom of interpersonal rituals and dialogic relationships at San Francisco State University in March of 2016. This band, Purple Gums, is a marked territory. The brassy trio (cornet, tuba, and saxophone, respectively) performed for a master class in the Creative Arts building for about 25folks in a medium-sized band room. For this performance, percussionist Vijay Anderson played with the usually drummerless trio. Minutes into the in-class performance, [William] Roper authoritatively erupts a spoken phrase through his mini-tuba: “Assume the position!” A bolt shivers our bones. He continues, invoking an aspect of life in this country. Purple Gums knows what this means. It’s imprinted upon the psyche of generations. Purple Gums refers to themselves as representative of a circular history: a story that’s not yet past. [Cornetist Bobby] Bradford tells us the excess of melanin in the skin causes relative coloration in the gums, and of the racial slurs attributed to it within and outside of the black community. He gives a sermon on the usage and appropriate inflection of the term motherfucker.
Purple Gums expresses an oppositional consciousness. Direct transmission of strategic methodology of pissedness and resistance technologies volley across the bandstand; seeing signs in culture (semiotics), analyzing these signs (deconstruction), synthesizing related forms (meta-ideologizing), erecting new principles of action (differential movement), and deploying egalitarian practices (democratics). Chela Sandoval’s seminal work Methodologies of the Oppressed exists for the purpose of generating dissidence and “revealing the rhetorical structure by which the languages of supremacy are uttered, rationalized—and ruptured.”
Purple Gums views music as narrative. A tune starts, by the time it ends, territory has been crossed, a story has been told. Most of the time the band lays down a backdrop for the audience to spin out their own creations within their heads. But on occasion, any one of the band's members will step to the mic and spin a yarn for you. Like the music, these stories are created extemporaneously—knowing the carnival ride you've stepped onto doesn't guarantee that you'll recognize the ride you step off of.
The nature of the signified totality of the presence of this group is that of their agency to produce musical sounds reflective of location/dislocation, dialogic inferences, traditions in/out of music, cultural signifiers, arbitrariness, and any, every part of their engagement.
This and related events were part of ImprovisAsians!, an annual performing arts and community-building event sponsored by Asian Improv aRts (AIR). The goals since 1987:
1) To make it possible for artists to create innovative works rooted in the diasporic experiences of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage.
3) To enable sustainability for artists and arts organizations in a challenging economic environment.
4) To facilitate creative collaborations that bring together major institutions, artists, and multigenerational audiences and participants.
The introduction—this introduction—into the subject matter of messages or propaganda or poetics of politics in art/music production is a reflexive process.
When I came to San Francisco 25 years ago as a student/street activist, I literally tripped over people like [saxophonist] Francis Wong, whose worldview and political consciousness shifted in response to the beating death of Vincent Chin near Detroit, Michigan, in June of 1982. Chrysler autoworkers—incensed about recent layoffs attributed to the boom in the Japanese car market—beat Chin to death with baseball bats outside of a bar at his bachelor party. The murderers received lenient fines and three years’ probation, and the state was satisfied. Asian Improv aRts was founded five years later by Wong and others. A bell can’t be unrung.
On the ride home from the class and performance, Vijay Anderson, an AIM devotee, shakes his head remembering how melodic Francis and Bobby are together. I think that overall harmony of difficult material is a binding substance for examination here.
La Paz Middle School is located in Salinas, California, a historic town in Monterey County near the Central Coast of California named for its salty marshes and fertile agriculture. Reflective of the population of the town, La Paz has a high Latino concentration, presumably descendants of generations of farm laborers. Just weeks before I delivered a two-day arts practicum on the visual culture of the Underground Railroad, a 16=year-old was murdered by the police fairly close to the school. The history curriculum is a complement to instructor Jason Flores’s constructivist education framework (ultimately based on the work of Jean Piaget). The classroom centers on meaning-making by exposing the tenets, on which the social construction of everything in the classroom is based. As a facilitator, Flores serves to remove obstacles to learning by cultivating cognitive development through a series of observable, didactic activities. Students, as makers-of-meaning themselves, engage in the democratic learning environment as they construct representations of history individually and collectively.
I taught four classes of La Paz Panthers waist-high in the stories of Frederick Douglass, Civil War battles, and coded Black Spirituals. I engaged these young investigators to synthesize their own expertise and acquired knowledge through a socio-historical, tactical arts practicum centered on the intervention of the Underground Railroad quilt codes. “Re-Imagining UGRR Quilt Codes” illustrates connections and dynamics between the Civil War–era Underground Railroad to currently existing underground railroad dynamics and the relevance in their lives today. A conductor is clearly more understood as a coyote in the parlance of La Paz students; a station is a safe house.
Using the tools of perception, production, and reflection, these students demonstrated they had shared an interpersonal relationship with history beyond that of a solely fact-based curriculum.
1) Perception: students study works of tactical media in historic relevance to emancipatory practices
2) Production: students use basic skills and principles of the art form and put their ideas into visual form
3) Reflection: students assess their work according to personal goals and standards of excellence in the field
In art, Constructivism has origins in the 1917 Russian Revolution, where artists built meaningful objects reflective of the resources used for construction. It was an art form rich with materials for producing a new culture through assigning art to a practical, socially useful role in everyday life. For good or bad, they rejected “autonomous art” and the idea of the individual artist in favor of collective movements, like Bauhaus or De Stijl. As a theory of knowledge in education, Constructivism demonstrates an interaction between experiences and idea development. In classrooms, the convergence of social and practical elements in learning advances discourse and an interpersonal, cultural connection to the learning experience.
The improvisational nature of the Underground Railroad is aligned with the collective and individual experiences of slaves and fugitives. “The struggles waged against domination and enslavement in everyday life took a varied of forms,” according to Saidiya V. Hartman. She continues:
Exploiting the limits of the permissible, creating transient zones of freedom, and re-elaborating innocent amusements were central features of everyday practice. Practice is, to use Michel de Certeau’s phrase, ‘a way of operating’ defined by the ‘the non-autonomy of its field of action, internal manipulation of the established order, and ephemeral victories.’
The dual invocation of the slave as property and person was an effort [that] wed reciprocity and submission, intimacy and domination, and the legitimacy of violence and the necessity of protection. By the same token, the law’s selective recognition of slave humanity nullified the captive’s ability to give consent or act as agent, and, at the same time, acknowledge the intentionality and agency of the slave but only as it assumes the form of criminality.
These nuances did not go unnoticed at La Paz. The young Panthers constructed reimagined coded quilt blocks, both mimicking the old ones and simultaneously inventing new ones. The students demonstrated their understanding of the need for safe houses, for a code, for a conductor, or coyote, to weave a network of mutual aid synthesizing technologies of the methodologies of oppressed persons. They taught me codes for safety in their everyday lives. Students exhibited a strong motivation to learn and a confidence in their potential for completing the project. We created nearly 100 new quilt blocks reflecting on both history and personal experiences and knowledge. These reflections of competence and belief in one’s potential to solve new problems are derived from first-hand experience of mastering problems in the past, and are much more powerful than any external acknowledgment and motivation.
Simultaneously inspired by [Gilles] Deleuze’s analyses of Leibniz and the Baroque, the map fails to address the Improviser’s choice to approach their instruments, not as jazz machines or rock ’n’ roll machines, but as improvising-machines. An appropriate correction might be to adjust #13 to read simply: Performance. However, I still find comfort in my bold appropriation. The waveform is code emblematic of the persistence of cognition. It represents a translation across media and lineage. It represents a path of identity formation as a significant, recognizable, and navigable event.
Referring to Kantian aesthetics of beauty in his book Economimesis, [Jacques] Derrida writes, "One must not imitate nature; but nature, assigning its rules to genius, folds itself, returns to itself, reflects itself through art.” “Kant,” he continues, “specifies that the only thing one ought to call art is the production of freedom by means of freedom [Hervorbringung durch Freiheit].” Pretty righteous words; to be clear, neither author is speaking of freedom from chains. They speak of an absolute freedom of expression: an art signifying pure ideas. Mimesis can roughly be defined as a representation of reality transmitted through empathetic means; economimesis is regarded, quite simply, as a process that exemplifies that appropriation.
It was Jacques Lacan who taught us that humans acquire identity through the acquisition of language process. Ideologies ingrained in that exchange are likewise absorbed. And it is his student, Slavoj Zižek who emphasizes that the effects of ideology are pervasive, powerful, and a nearly inescapable aspect of our world. Zižek further emphasizes a “creative refusal” of ideology sparked by a profound political change in the S/self, such as the 1917 Russian revolt against capitalism. We can say that oppositional consciousness, a term from Third World feminist praxis, was acquired through discursive processes.
"His was an historical music. He began himself before he played with Fletcher Henderson, playing alternate piano in the orchestra when Fletcher conducted. In recent years he even brought Fletcher and Duke back with a sweetness and contemporary restatement that was thrilling.
Ra was so far out because he had the true self-consciousness of the Afro American intellectual artist revolutionary. He knows our historic ideology and socio-political consciousness was freedom. It is an aesthetic and social dynamic. We think it is good and beautiful!"
In 1999, the “Improvising Across Borders” symposium at the University of California at San Diego introduced me to the subject. Pianist Dana Reason had organized the conference at which George Lewis, Pauline Oliveros, Douglas Ewart, Eddie Prévost, LaDonna Smith, JD Parran, Hafez Modirzadeh, and many more were present. I recently found a quote from LaDonna Smith on her experience:
One purpose of the Symposium was to explore one of the most previously slighted, but critically important fundamentals in music creativity and its true role in the shaping of musical traditions, styles, and current direction.
Quantum computing is a revolutionary method of computing based on quantum physics that uses the abilities of particles such as electrons to exist in more than one state at the same time. Quantum computation can operate simultaneously on a combination of seemingly incompatible inputs. By analogy or metaphor quantum Improvisation could mean a leap into new and ambiguous consciousness opening a new variety of choices.
At the same symposium, pianist and composer Vijay Iyer gave a memorable presentation on “African American Improvised Music and Embodied Cognition,” in which he analyzed Thelonious Monk’s music with the help of a multimedia display complete with transcriptions and minute details that delight me to this day. This moment greatly informed my thinking on analyzing music, as well as elucidated a process that I had unwittingly undertaken. Iyer’s presentation described and analyzed the way Monk’s fingers moved upon the keyboard with precision: the matrix of complexities pouring through expressive nodes in the body. As citizen-subjects, we often find ourselves to be subject to dominant ideological elements similarly quilted into our identities and woven into our imaginations. Robin D.G. Kelly’s book on Monk gives us a wealth of insight into the total social fact (Mauss) of the man, entreating us, as fans of his magic, to peer into this “bond between giver and gift.” We cannot ignore the conditions of cruelty and subjugation to admire the diamonds that such pressure creates. Iyer’s analysis of Monk’s embodied expression demands that Monk’s emulators reach beyond the sounds that come through one’s home speakers.
George Lewis’s essay “Improvised Music after 1950: Afrological and Eurological Perspectives” was weighed on my mind during this period in my development. I remember that John Cage’s body of work is known and accepted for his innovations and privilege, and Charlie Parker’s body of work is known and accepted for his innovations and remarkable lack of, and struggle for, privilege. Generations emulated Parker’s research and sound, along with other black musicians of that era; compelled by the representation of those artists’ lives in their music. I’ve wondered if their interest is in the actual conditions of their lives, or so it seems to me, the forces-in-motion that perpetuate those conditions. The oft quoted social theorist bell hooks writes, “Throughout African American history, performance has been crucial in the struggle for liberation.” She refers, of course, to minstrelsy. Moreover, Saidiya V. Hartman talks explicitly in her book about the auction block as a site of forced enjoyment, where slaves were made to dance and whoop it up at the crack of the whip
I still see/practice “free music” and “creative music” as resistance music. I trace my interest in participating in music back to an exposure to Bob Marley, Parliament, and Earth, Wind & Fire as a youth. However, I am an Improviser. “Improvising Across Borders” addressed borders real and imagined, and made them all permeable. I was certainly in the right place at the right time! I had involved myself with this music as an extension of my political education, practices, and deep curiosity about how this form of resistance would change my sense of self, self-consciousness, and actions. I remember daring to raise my hand at that symposium saying that I thought there was going to be some kind discussion about the actual border: you know, the one between us and Mexico. There wasn’t meant to be one, although there is room enough for that to be my work.
Eleven years ago, the Clandestine Revolutionary Indigenous Committee-General Command of the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) launched La Sexta from Laconcondon Jungle. This was the Sixth Declaration from the Zapatistas deep in the jungles of their autonomous zones surrounded by Southern Mexico, and the largest listening party the world has ever seen. Masked Zapatistas collected stories, complaints, recollections, evidence, and other data from the machinations of capitalism and status quo politics throughout the length and breadth of the country. The kick off in San Cristobal began with a peaceful occupation of the zocalo, or town square, by thousands of Zapatista and hundreds of press. Three musical acts took the stage, setting the tone. They played songs people knew. I imagined a performance by the World Saxophone Quartet in the zocalo in San Cristobal de las Casas in the State of Chiapas that New Year's Eve in 2005. What a gig?!? That stage was built with much more that wood and nails. I imagined WSQ, with all its members over time, ascending to the stage miraculously playing “The Hard Blues” together as the system of music to jump off such a project in the States, and I knew I had to be in a band worthy of that stage.
Marshall Trammell is an African American percussionist born July 21, 1972 in Oceanside, CA and raised in Kaneohe, Oahu, Hawaii. Upon exposure to the Glenn Spearman Double Trio and ROVA's conduction systems, he has been a contributing member of the Bay Area Creative Music scene his arrival in San Francisco in 1993. Influences include Donald Robinson, Eddie Blackwell, Louis Moholo, Milford Graves & Papa Joe Jones are present in his performance on the drum set, while a deep exposure to Cuban, Haitian and West African linear drum systems shift his focus away from conventions in Jazz and Free Jazz.
Mr Trammell is a Soloist, Curator and Chief Investigator at Music Research Strategies. He curates "Decolonizing the Imagination: Arts Practicum & Democratics" and conducts "Black Fighting Formations," a conduction system based visual culture and cooperative economics of the Underground Railroad. Mr. Trammell has performed with such luminaries as Roscoe Mitchell, India Cooke, John Tchicai, Dylan Carlson & Saul Williams. He is a recoding artist as a member of the electro-acoustic duo Black Spirituals (SIGE Records) which performs internationally with Zachary James Watkins.
Gregory Hoeppfner, who produces under the name Almeeva, has a varied musical past. We could traverse all of those paths, but let’s look at the here and now. “Some Revelation” starts off dazzling and fluttering, and by the end, you’re left with an ephemeral feeling.
Hoeppfner notches up the rhythm in a way that lulls you towards the beat. Machine gun timpani lights your way. The production has snaps, is sprinkled with claps unexpectedly, and only occasionally lets some air into the room for a transitory break.
Lyrically, you’re expected to understand yourself and what’s in your head before seeking a deeper understanding from the outside world. His voice is one that doesn’t necessarily spar with the production, but it does battle for dominance as passively as possible.
The energetic pace doesn’t really let up, and the light of it all only becomes that much more blinding as the climax of the track is reached. We’ll see where the energy takes us as he releases Unset on April 19th. You can pre-order it now from his bandcamp.

Posted on July 28, 2016 by chogministries | Comments Off on Movement to Unite in Prayer on September 11
On Sunday, September 11, congregations across the Church of God and beyond will set aside their Sunday schedules for a focused time of prayer. Like the solemn, sacred assemblies held during the time of the Prophet Joel, we will humbly seek God’s forgiveness and restoration as we commit to re-engage in his divine purposes (Joel l:13–14). Recent escalating tensions around the globe and in our own backyard have only served as a wake-up call to the imminent need for a united plea to our God for hope, for answers, and for healing.
Charles Wright, Kansas Ministries regional pastor, experienced a similar solemn assembly earlier this year. He stresses the overwhelming need for the Church of God to renew the prominence of prayer in personal and congregational life. “I pray the church recovers the emphasis the Bible gives to prayer,” he explains. “For example, Matthew 12:13 states, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer…’ It seems much of the evangelical world has made our gatherings a house of singing and preaching/teaching, rather than prayer. Not that prayer isn’t offered, but in most cases time allotted to it is much less that singing and preaching. If we really desire to put first things first, we need to heed Paul’s admonition—‘First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, for kings and all who are in high positions, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and dignity. This is right and is acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires everyone to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth’” (1 Timothy 2:1–4 NRSV; emphasis added).
With an emphasis on the practical, Charles offers some clues to help the local church reignite a passion for prayer. “Anytime we begin to focus more on prayer, it’s a good thing. However, I find people need structure that teaches them better how to pray. In recent discussions with pastors, we have agreed most attempts to form prayer groups have fizzled with time. I think one of the reasons is that we have lost the early church practice of praying the Scriptures, particularly the Psalms. I, another pastor, and his church have been practicing for several months the Daily Prayer from the Church of England website. It has been transformative for the two of us and this congregation. Rather than a fizzling prayer group, it has grown and remains steady. The comments we’ve heard say the structure helps them to know better how to pray. Therefore, I sense God is leading us to create communities of prayer in our congregations.”
Charles Wright also recommends the following resources to help their Cry Out to the Lord experience be more than a one-time prayer rally, but also a launch pad to reclaim the prominence of prayer in personal and church life: The Case for the Psalms: Why They Are Essential, by N.T. Wright; Answering God: The Psalms as Tools for Prayer, by Eugene Peterson; and Psalms: The Prayer Book of the Bible by Dietrich Bonhoeffer.
May the Lord incline his ear to us as we approach the throne of grace together on Sunday, September 11. Let us know you’ll be participating with us by signing up at www.jesusisthesubject.org/cryout, where you’ll also find downloadable resources available for free.

I recently needed a dish for a holiday potluck and came across an olive salad. It basically had one kind of olive, some vinegar, parsley and olive oil which sounded kinda boring. Below is what I ended up making and it seemed to go over pretty well. This is a great alternative to those mayo heavy pasta salads that folks usually bring to the office potluck. I don’t have to mention that you should use pitted olives right? Unless you don’t really care for your co-workers that much, or you need to see who paid attention in safety class.
give the olives a rough chop so they are different shapes and sizes being careful not to chop them to small, they are the main attraction. Dump in all the other stuff and mix well or dump in everything but the feta and sprinkle the feta on top for those that want some. serve room temperature or cold

I know a lot of people who cross nurse. I never did it because I didn't need to. And I was with my son non stop for the 1st 10 months of his life. But I would have done it for any of my friends and I have plenty of people I would have been OK with doing it for me. I am glad she had the support she needed when she needed it.
Wow thank you for sharing that amazing article! Really isn't it about so much more then cross nursing? I understand why they used that headline but that article is worthy of a read for so many reasons. Lots of food for thought. I loved for example how she contrasted the hours and days after her child's birth with her friend's experience.
The loss of this superior piece of software is, from my perspective, not just reason to be sad, but cause to start looking at the failures of "free" software and packaged browsers.
Much as was predicted so many years past, Internet Explorer made it impossible for alternate browsers to compete for space on a Windows desktop. Safari now seems to be doing the same in our world.
Sadly, only a few would pay a price for Camino if a price tag had been affixed -- we've been taught since Andreesen gave us Mosaic that we should expect someone else to pay for our web browser; Gates and Jobs both told us we should get it with our OS, which only gave them more control over us.
Yes, there are alternatives -- for now. But I fear this end of an era is a harbinger of a bleak future we all face when it comes to personal choice and quality software. The movement of more and more of our lives to "the cloud" only makes me see a dark storm on the horizon.
To all who touched the code of Chimera and Camino -- you made lives better. The loss of the product will make lives worse. We will miss you.

I am talking Sunday Morning about blogging and the contests on blogs and would like some input - Page 2 - Online-Sweepstakes.com
The main difference is that the draw pool is smaller and it is not regukated by any laws other then the FTC disclosure law.
Best way to track that I know of is to create a google re-occuring search to send you an email when your name, email address, or screen name appears anywhere on the net!
Yes google searches are not perfect but other then trying to keep track yourself that is the only way really. I will add that most bloggers ( myself included) who do giveaways contact the winners which is why we need email addresses in the first place. We really do want to give the item away and so do the sponsors. The easiest thing to do is nOT enter contests where you have to check back.
I love doing blog giveaways but I'm still pretty new at it so maybe you can answer some of my questions. A lot of what I can get confused by is blogger stuff, I have a little blog for a few months but still get lost on what to do.
1.) A lot of mandatory or extra ask you to be a GFC follower, and sometimes I can't find that little box to join site, so I simply follow them on blogger. What is the big difference between GFC and being just a blogger follower? If I'm just a blogger follower does that still count?
2.) Another popular extra is to add their button, and I am having the hardest time figuring out how to do that. If you know a good website or link on how to do it that'd be great.
4.) What is your advice on entering blog contests in which you already won from a sister/same corporation of the sponsor, for example I had no clue one t-shirt company was related to the other until a blogger mentioned it, meaning I was entering many contests I was not even eligible for. Is it different for big companies though like Wal-mart/Sam's club? How long are until you are eligible to win again from a sponsor? A good estimate would be great like a year?
5.) Do you recommend doing the daily tweets for extras because I rarely do this because I find it to be very overwhelming, but notice many people doing it endlessly.
Yes i think it does make a difference. If I am going to check to see if you did indeed follow me I am only going to check my GFC feed. If the box is not working email the blog owner or leave that in a comment so they can be aware of it
You can only add the button if you yourself have a blog. It is normally a small piece of code that you copy and paste into the side of your own blog using an HTML gadget. Again, if you are having a problem alert the blog owner so that they can help you
If a package is lost in the mail, it is usually the fault of either the sponsor or the PR company handling fufilment. Most bloggers dont send out the prizes themselves. You can ask the blogger in a private email to assist you and most are happy to do so. I recently was able to get another package sent to the winner myself
Unless it specifically states on the blog post you can win multiple times from the same sponsor and even the same blog. Some companies however specifically state you can only win so often or so many times so watch for that. Also sometimes multiple blogs will host the same contest and sometimes you can win from only one of the participating blogs.
The daily tweet is by far the easiest way to rack up extra entries. If you want to increase your overall odds, that is the way to do it. Just make sure you go back to the blog to let them know it in a comment.
Soooooo...I would love some feedback for those of you that were still there. Both positive and negative feedback is welcome!
Enjoyed your presentation very much. Made me want to try blogging sites. I finally had a chance to go to your blog and try to follow the directions for the Alight give away. I hope I did it right!
I still find it confusing to go to blog sites, so hopefully I will get used to them and understand how to enter their sweeps as I get more experienced!
thanks for the feedback! If you tell me what name you used I will check for you to make sure you did it right. If you have any questions, just ask!
"...and then Jack chopped down the beanstock, adding murder and ecological vandalism to the theft, enticement and vandalism charges already mentioned, but he got away with it and lived happily ever after without so much as a guilty twinge about what he had done. Which proves that you can be excused just about anything if you're a hero, because no one asks the inconvenient questions." Terry Pratchett's The Hogfather
Relay ladder logic -- with real relays! What cracks me up are the same squeaky sound effects added for all the tools: drills, borers, milling cutters, etc.
I recently read about punch card based CNC machines that existed before the advent of digital computers. So I'm glad I got to see this video.
Add one more thing that existed before digital technology: ICBMs, electrical ignition, antibiotics, television and radio, air conditioning, etc.
Despite 60 years of slight gains in technological advancement, most people are actually now less materially wealthy.
That's what is called dedicated tooling because it's only designed to do one specific thing but it does it very efficiently.
I think I might be right in saying that those gearboxes will still being used in Land Rovers until about fifteen years ago.
What cracks me up are the same squeaky sound effects added for all the tools: drills, borers, milling cutters, etc.
As far as I recall, that squeaky sound effect could as well be a recording of the sound the BMC cars made as you drove them.
Punch card type programming was used in textile manufacturing long before CNC machines, tabulators & computers.
Hmm... 60 years of slight gains in technology? Not sure about that. Lots of technological innovation between 1958 & 2018, in almost every aspect of our lives (from what we eat, how we work, how we go to war, how we heal the sick, even how we procreate!). Less material wealth? Not sure how you lived in the 50's, but my experience is a vastly different one than that of my parents. Not saying everything is better (in fact, there are many aspects of the "good old days" that would be welcome, today), but we live cleaner, more healthy and longer lives than ever before thanks to technology. It's a shame that we're now living long enough for a whole new cast of degenerative diseases to affect us, but technology is at work on those problems as well.

I made a 4-code punch-card type command to execute different maneuvers(two QTIs and 4 pieces of cardstock with sharpie:P). The idea was to set it to do line-following, sumo-bot, etc.
Another great vintage video about Henry Ford pushing his best engineers to mass market a V-8 engine. In particular, I like the serious off-road plunge at 3:40 and that he isolated his top engineers in Thomas Edison's lab (on his property) to develop the engine in secret. Also forced them to use only Edison's old belt-driven machine shop! Henry was quirky, also the richest man in America. Elon has a long way to go to catch up.
As I recall the punched card was first created for looms, for making complicated weaves such as tweed. They are still used for custom orders of broadloom such as carpeting. Then Herman Hollerith came up with the idea to use them for his tabulator which was used to speed up the census.
And speaking of Edison and Ford, let's just say one thing, Florida. I won't mention in public their thoughts which would make Wagner feel good.
There are a couple of reasons why I asked . The first is to do with the challenge and in a way realism.

Breaking on TV today (May 9th) with the first of five executions, the campaign will also include online and social elements as well as retail presence, with call-to-action based creative introduced across Betfred.com’s 1,400 shops nationwide.
Focussing on Betfred.com’s fun and friendly brand positioning, our creating team came up with the idea of using finger characters to play out comedy real slice-of-life moments. As well as being a reference to the way fingers play with touchscreen devices, ‘Have more fun with your fingers’ supports Betfred.com’s focus on entertainment value when it comes to engaging with their products.
Our Creative Director, Tom Richards, said of the campaign: 'Challenged with bringing Betfred.com's fun and friendly positioning to life for the mobile casino and slots products, we wanted to come up with something that brought a human element to mobile gaming, contrasting with the genre of hyper-slick CG films while reminding people that smartphones would be nothing without fingers. Our ‘fun fingers’ approach does just that, tapping into relatable, real-life situations at times when we could all do with some Betfred.com fun.'

Recently I read this quote: "The secret of success is to go from mistake to mistake without losing your enthusiasm!" In reality life is a series of mistakes. The trick is to keep going till you find what makes you happy.
A big house, nice car, large screen TVs and money in the bank may be all that you need to make you feel satisfied in life; and that is perfectly fine. Or you may be one of those who feels restless regardless of how successful you are and how much money you have accumulated. If you are part of the latter group you may feel something is definitely missing in your life. So, one sleepless night you get out of bed and book a trip to a far land. When you get there you feel at home. When you are back you cannot wait to go on to the next trip. Basic living quarters are all you need to rest at night. You save your money so you can travel more and get away from the hectic pace of your city. You can live on less money. New adventures surely beat the weekend getaways or the expensive restaurants. You are an adventurer!
It does not matter which group you belong to. If you have lived long enough you have already experienced the calm and the turbulence of daily living. Life has a funny way of making us humble. Just when you think you have it all figured out and have Plan B and Plan C in place something unexpected happens and new challenges present themselves. As you navigate through these ups and downs your outlook towards life changes.
Over the years and after conducting thousands of hours of sessions and seminars I have realized that most adventurers just want to explore. They know what they want in life and feel their best when they are traveling to new places. At times they are frustrated with negativity that family and friends bring upon them.
I always ask my clients this simple question: "Are you tortured enough and want nothing else at this point in your life but to feel comfort again and make a change?". The question is simple enough. But the answer may not be. Sometimes, misery is very familiar to us and hard to let go, specially when it has been with us for a while.
The good news is that you are capable of letting go of destructive relationships and negative people. And it is much easier to change your life than you may imagine it to be.
Start by exercising and letting go of clutter. Travel. Make a plan that you know you can stick to. If it is hard to do so, it is OK too. There are many capable hypnotherapists, life coaches, neurolinguistic practitioners, homeopaths, psychologists and psychiatrists that can help you with your first step. Just remember that you are the one that should want to do this and no one can push you into it. Going back to my question again, are you ready for change? If the answer is yes, take the first step. Get help. And go on an adventure!

You are taking a probiotic and you think you understand what that does. Now people are talking about prebiotics and you’re not sure whether you should be taking that as well ?
A prebiotic is a food that feeds the gut bacteria whereas a probiotic is a combination of strains of various gut bacteria. Different types of prebiotics can feed different strains of bacteria so the prebiotic can be used therapeutically to promote beneficial strains at the expense of more problematic strains.
Lots of different foods are prebiotics as well as various supplements. For an appropriate list of foods look at my most recent blog Feed your Good Gut Bacteria . In terms of prebiotic supplements there are a number of interesting options to consider.
Hydrolysed Guar Gum is a partially broken down soluble fiber which is extracted from the Indian Cluster bean.
Galacto-oligodisaccharidases (GOS) are made from either a milk product source or from chicory roots. It is helpful if someone is also constipated and may increase bifidobacteria as well.
Larch is the bark of a tree. It supports the production of a key fuel to support the integrity of the gut lining known as butyrate. It also has been shown to support the growth of good gut bacteria such as Bifidobacteria and Lactobacillus which reducing the growth of E Coli and Clostridia. It is thought that the larch stimulates the immune system and therefore keeps opportunistic bugs in check.
Lactulose is made of up of two sugars galactose and fructose and is used to treat constipation. It is not digested like other sugars and therefore when it moves through to the colon the bacteria can feed on it and it draws water into the stool making it easier to pass.
Once you know the composition of your gut flora you can really assist in building better diversity by supporting the growth of beneficial strains or by crowding out problem bacteria. Ideally using testing such as a Comprehensive Digestive Stool Analysis or directly through a group like Ubiome you can improve your knowledge of your gut bacteria.
Research shows that on average probiotics last 13 to 17 days in the gastrointestinal tract which means that, whilst it is a good strategy in the short term to crowd out problematic bacteria, the reality is that diet is the best way to improve your gut flora.
At least 6 serves of veggies and 2-3 pieces of fruit daily! Why? The resistant starch as well as pectins found in these foods provides a good source of food for gut bacteria so you need to make sure that your diet includes sufficient to feed them well.
Take probioitic strains that you may be low in – many people use a Comprehensive Digestive Stool analysis (CDSA) to see if they are low in specific strains.
Know your yoghurts – Whilst most claim that they contain beneficial strains only Vaalia and Activa have been tested and have verifiable claims. Vaalia yoghurt contains three beneficial strains which seems to generate good results at approximately half a cup a day. Most people who are lactose intolerant can cope with approximately half a cup.
Spirulina, green tea and almonds have been shown to increase the levels of Lactobacilli – green tea also may increase fat burning and almonds are a good source of essential fatty acids.
Bifidobacteria can be assisted by eating raw carrots and brown rice – which also provide a source of good fibre for the gut.
Fermented Foods like sauerkraut, kim-chi and cabbage are another proven method to improve gut health and flora as well as added benefits such as – reducing pesticide residue, helping metabolise hormones and reducing anti-nutrients while increasing the concentration of key nutrients such as niacin by up to 175%!
Christine Pope is a nutritionist and homeopath based at Elemental Health at St Ives. Her focus in clinical practice is on improving gut health as it is critical to improving overall wellbeing.
Most people think that a baby gets its gut flora during delivery and that C section means they don’t acquire the same beneficial flora. Actually a baby can develop gut flora up to about age four and there are a number of factors that can affect it.
First up it seems that the uterus is not sterile and there is already some gut flora distributed in utero. So if you already have a child with allergies, or you have them, make sure during your pregnancy that you supplement with a good range of probiotics or consume fermented foods regularly but at a minimum for at least two months prior to the delivery.
Breast feeding also passes useful flora to the baby and you don’t really need to breastfeed for that long to see a significant benefit. Solely breast feeding to 4 months was shown by a large scale South Australia study to reduce allergies by at least 25%. I know its often challenging breast feeding and if you have difficulties its really worth speaking with either the nurses at the Early Childhood Centres or the Nursing Mother’s Association, both sources of invaluable support.
If you end up having intervention like a C section or you can’t breastfeed , it may be useful to add a specific probiotic for children, as well.
Minimising antibiotic use during the first few years is also an important way to ensure a stable and resilient gut flora. Homeopathic medicines can make a great alternative treatment for children during the early stages of illness. I often use a combination called ABC mix for parents to assist with fevers and ear infections. ABC mix is three homeopathic medicines known as Aconite, Belladonna and Chamomila and can be a good combination to use with mild fevers or ear pain.

It was nothing less than “a spark, a flash” in the theatergoers’ lexicon. The combustion emanated from the Broadway classic “West Side Story,” as played out in Illinois by a part-deaf, part-hearing young company.
It was a joint venture between MacMurray College and the Illinois School for the Deaf in 2000. And it nearly didn’t happen.
The play’s plot, as author Mark Rigney reminds us, “is a barely altered adaptation of William Shakespeare’s ‘Romeo and Juliet,’ with street gangs standing in for the Bard’s Capulets and Montagues.” The show first opened on Broadway in 1957. Thanks to Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim, and Arthur Laurents, it’s brilliant but difficult music and dance, even without the deafness factor. But author Rigney’s wife, Diane Brewer, who in 1999 was the newly named drama head at MacMurray, decided to take on the deaf/hearing mix. And once her decision was made, the aforementioned sparks and flashes flew indeed.
For starters, those responsible for the Illinois project were worried that the deaf/hearing divide could be a self-fulfilling prophecy, leading to the sort of divide that “West Side Story” condemns. Rigney writes: They “are concerned that the students will be enticed into acting out the violence in the script, internalizing it, romanticizing it,” and perhaps being drawn to such behavior. (That proves a baseless fear.) There are practical matters of stage placement, not to mention costumes for characters who are signing alongside various main actors.
Early on, the cast can be found huddling in a basement, waiting out a tornado alert. (Again, ultimately, there’s no cause for alarm.) There are the flares of temperament that often coincide with creativity. And, not least, it turns out that Brewer is pregnant.
Rigney’s account of this small tale of an unusual production is intelligent and humane. For example, he demonstrates both sensitivity and humor in the encounters that occur among the deaf. Discussing the interplay among the cast and crew, he records: “Embarrassed by her poor signing, Terri tells Christopher through [a third character], ‘If I sign something dumb, like “Your mother is a cow,” you can assume that isn’t what I meant.’
“Christopher nods and smiles, ‘O-Kay,’ choosing one of his favorite words. Under his guidance, the two syllables twist and stretch into something far greater than the word was ever meant to be; when Christopher says ‘O-Kay,’ it becomes a sort of a blessing.”
Rigney suggests at one point that Laurents’s ’50s-style slang, much of which he invented, causes everyone fits. In some cases, where idioms or jive find no American Sign Language equivalent, Carrie and the students resort to signing ‘silly, very silly.’”
Rigney gives the humor added context. “Comedy,” Laurents is quoted as saying, “is exactly what’s needed in the face of tragedy -- it’s the tension between the two that holds the audience.”
In a more serious light, there are Rigney’s artfully portrayed players. Pearlene, for instance, plays the young, deaf Maria. As Rigney relates, she “shakes her head in frustration and her hair flies across her face. ‘Why,’ she asks, ‘should I connect with the music when I can’t hear the music?’”
Then there’s the political dimension of deafness. Rigney discusses this in depth, suggesting at one point: “Lawmakers, like most Americans, don’t think about deafness any more than they think about Mars.
“In any event, the deaf community is hardly cohesive enough to form an ongoing voting block. Rough estimates suggest that some two million Americans are unable to hear spoken languages, and approximately sixteen million Americans have some degree of hearing loss.”
And, he says, in the charged sphere of deaf communications, the choice of methods “remains a controversial topic even today, and the use of speech by a deaf or hard-of-hearing person can become either unwitting or a willful political act.”
This reflection and analysis are surely germane, but Rigney is strongest when he’s closest to Brewer and the singular rendition of the show. (Ultimately, their production is a shining success.)
As Rigney says, “Maria teaches [Tony] the sign for ‘I love you,’ and they press their fingers together in a matching, mirrored tableau. . . . This is the single most important moment in the play.”
Mark Rigney is a writer whose stories have appeared in THEMA and The Bellevue Review, and whose plays have been staged at the Foothill Theatre Company, the Utah Shakespeare Festival, and the Alleyway Theatre. He lives in Evansville, IN.

A group of Polish activists successfully sued to get rid of the ban in the European Court of Human Rights. But winning in court doesn't mean winning hearts and minds of the vast majority of Poles, who cling to their conservative social and religious views.
Daniel Nardicio, who has made a name for himself in New York promoting underground parties where clothes are as scarce as inhibitions, has more recently expanded his mini-empire of sleaze into other ventures -- including Playgirl magazine, which he revamped. His championing of Levi Johnston, the baby daddy of Sarah Palin's granddaughter, put him in the front lines of the political and gossip columns.
Nothing, however, prepared Nardicio for what he would encounter on that hot summer weekend in Warsaw. In an exclusive interview with EDGE, Daniel tells of the pride, the passion -- and the persecution -- he encountered.
Daniel came to Warsaw at the invitation of some of the organizers of events surrounding the Europride march. He brought some New York City nightlife luminaries, such as Amanda Lapore, Sherry Vine, gogo boys, Lady Bunny and some bulesque queens.
What happened was unexpected and unfortunate. "All these people didn’t get paid," he says. "We were booked into a room at a Polish club. The organizers had no intention of paying the entertainers. It was absolute chaos."
A club owner asked Daniel to sign a paper that he would pay for the club. "I explained that in no way was I taking on the financial responsibility," he says. "I was curating, not producing."
Also on hand were gay luminaries, such as Dustin Lance Black, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of the film Milk.
"We kept meeting all these gay guys who told us, ’We’re not going to the parade,’" Daniel says. "Polish gays are afraid to come out. But we put ourselves on the front line -- which turned out to be dangerous."
There were 11 floats in the parade, which, according to the New York Times, attracted only 8,000 people. That contrasts with 50,000 at the Europride celebration in Zurich, Switzerland, the year before.
Black had asked if the police were holding back the protesters. In Daniel’s opinion, they were only doing so because of the presence of the international press and photographers and bloggers covering the event on the Internet.
The police were (barely) holding back protesters from well-organized right-wing group opposed to liberalization and to homosexuality in particular.
The head of an ultra-conservative group, All-Polish Youth, which drew several hundred, told the New York Times he represented the majority of Poles.
"Polish society is much more conservative than the establishment," Robert Winnicki said. "Polish society is more passive. People do not take part in the public debate. We are the voice of the majority."
Daniel personally experienced eggs being thrown at him and those around him. There were also firecrackers and other tiny incendiary devices.
More than those, however, were the nasty stares coming from the housewives and others in the windows along the route. Throughout the route, people were "flipping the bird" at the marchers.
"My personal heroes were these straight women who stayed the whole day," Daniel says. "They had eggs, firecrackers thrown at them. I was flipped off at least 200 times. After a while, it gets to you."
There were people from all over Europe who had come to show solidarity, which also impressed Daniel. One of the members of a gay choir from London was hit with a rock.
"My boyfriend thought was something uplifting," Daniel opines. "He was proud to be part of the beginning of something here. I look at the money I lost as a donation to the Polish Gay Pride movement. I do know -- I hope -- I never experience anything like that again."

So sad that my country folk are so backward. I love Poland but stories like this make me glad to live in the USA. When I visit Poland, what strikes me the most is that gays are underground and afraid to come out for those reasons. With small steps, we will move forward. I came out to my old neighbors, all were very supportive in my small town of Zakopane. Didn’t get a rock in the head.
much too exaggerated, maybe because Mr. Nardicio has never had experiences like this one before. yes, there were plenty aggresive objectors at the beginning, as usual, but after getting out of the first square, it got quite nice and easy (as usual). the policemen got also more friendly, they even didn’t wear their uniforms. on the way there were also people standing around on the street, and others in the windows, which have greeted the march with joy and rainbow flags. or should we compare this one with the march in Cracow just few years ago, which has ended as a bloodstained battle and some houndreds of wounded people on both sides? it’s also not what it seems, that there were no parades in Warsaw since the banned one back there in 2005. they are going every year since, only this time Warsaw has hosted EuroPride, which eventually was the first time in Eastern Europe. and I can assure you, it was the obvious choice - you wouldn’t like to see it in Sofia, Bucarest or even Budapest, where the things are going much more nasty. Poland is really changing right now. the other problem is the organizers and the money-thing. the way they have lead the parades year after year results in very little support from gay people, even organizations and activists. they can really discourage people and damage the image of Poland and polish gay movement. I’m very sorry for what happened to Mr. Nardicio and his crew, unfortunatelly I have to say, it was also typical. EP2010 was so dissapointing, that it seems, they won’t do it next year again. I really hope so.
Mr Nardicio didnt exaggerate anything. I was involved in the parade as well, and was pelted with eggs, and fire bombs onto our float. This is NOT usual. Not usual or typical in anyway. This is hate, and it is violent and ugly. Hopefully all involved helped make atleast a little bit of a change to the small minded people and gave hope to the others.
Ladies and Gentlemen. As the organizer of EuroPride 2010 in Warsaw, I owe a few words of explanation on Daniel Nordicio and events organized by him, After Dark. First of all, EuroPride organizers did not come to Daniel but Daniel came to the organizers. Agreement was drawn up which clearly regulates the financial affairs between the parties. Mr. Daniel Nordicio was not only the organizer of the After Dark events, and not only a promoter as claimed. The contract clearly states that he should cover all costs associated with their organization. Just as he had to cover all costs, just as all proceeds were to go into the account of Daniel Nordicio. EuroPride organizers had the slightest influence on the events and most importantly, had no economic benefits of the organized events. Mr. Daniel Nordicio forgot to add that on the main event, when he realized that not everything goes to his thoughts, just escaped. Even at night, packed their belongings and fled from the Polish, with no cover liabilities to which he was obliged. He left without payment of remuneration of artists, who were invited by him and with who he had daily contact. As the organizers of EuroPride, we did not negotiate any contracts and we have not had the slightest contact with the artists. In our humble opinion, Daniel Nordicio should be ashamed of his behavior and how he has treated us and artists. Please also note that on the basis of a contract signed between us, the organizers EuroPride gets to court, assert their rights, both financial (EuroPride organizer covers some costs of Daniel Nordicio) and about libel, which takes place in the commented article.
In what sort of world this guys lives? What was he expecting happy faces all over the place? Beside it is exaggeration. I was marching there as well. If he looks like he looks i’m not suprised he got stares. But than again i’ve seen planty of people on their balconies waving to us, police was ok. Didn’t have any sort of problems with them. Hopefully we will not see him again cuz his little weird face might get destroyed by all this nasty people around. Get a life men.

The sumptuous BOTTLETOP leather collection, designed by Vincent Du Sartel, sees scuba blue set against dove grey. Seasonal scallop pink, ambrosia green and opal blue add a softer dimension in both Enamel and Canvas organic cotton styles. Pretty detailing adds a playful twist, referencing the BOTTLETOP signature materials and linings featuring the BOTTLETOP signature jaquard print.
Working with multi talented photographer and film Director Jerome Duran, we set out to tell the story of the Amazon collection by shooting the collection in a Rainforest in Brazil, but we chose an urban Rainforest in Sao Paulo (in a celebrated park designed by Robert Burle Marx, one of Brazil’s most important landscape architects, in the 1950’s) to reflect the ‘city cool’ aesthetic of the collection.
The Burle Marx Park is a haven for birds and other important, protected animal species as one of the last remaining places with Atlantic RainForest within the bustling city of Sao Paulo

J’ai enfin trouvé le temps de lire l’ouvrage de Sylvain Laurens, Les courtiers du capitalisme. Milieux d’affaires et bureaucrates à Bruxelles (Marseille: Agone, 2015). Je l’ai vraiment trouvé excellent, et, pour une fois, j’ai découvert quelqu’un que ses recherches rendaient encore plus pessimiste que moi sur l’avenir de l’Union européenne, ou tout du moins sur son avenir de gauche. La dernière phrase de la conclusion (voir plus bas) parait sans appel.

IIRC LVO has some really long lead times for getting events scheduled. This will be a Nationals event aiming at 30+ just like all the rest
I feel like what I’d love for Alchemists is a central midfielder, someone who is a bruiser to compliment Katalyst. Kami sounds dope but I just want someone to take the heat off the more fragile players and reliably generate momentum
I believe in this context that a scramble implies that it's just an 8 player event that fires when full as opposed to having a specific start time.
Longshanks event here: https://www.longshanks.org/events/?event=1251 Still getting it in sync with ticket sales, but if you're thinking of coming it would be great it people could start signing up
The goal line is infinitely thin; if you are within 6” of the back edge of the pitch with the ball then you generate no momentum.
Air BNB basically. The Montreal Metro is pretty good, and the store is nearby a Metro station. There are lots of good, reasonably priced places. There are several people coming from out of town, so we can start asking if people don't have accommodation yet if you're looking for a roommate.
For Minerva's Easy Pickings When this model makes an Attack against a model with lower current HP than its Recovery Level, this model gains [+1] DMG to Playbook Damage Results The "its" is a bit ambiguous, but I think the intention is that if Minerva attacks say, Hearne, who is on 9 HP, which is less than his recovery level of 10, that Minerva would gain +1 DMG? As opposed to if Minerva makes an attack when her own HP is 5, which is lower than her recovery level, that she games [+1] DMG?
If this model starts its activation within [6"] of the named friendly model, choose one of the following benefits. This model gains the chosen benefit for the remainder of the turn: Let’s say the Alloy player forgets the ability at the start of activation. Since this ability uses if instead of when, can this ability be used later in the turn, assuming both players agree that Alloy started his activation in range. Further, could a player knowingly wait to make the choice until later in the activation?
And lest people are concerned: the performance prizes are all trophies and certificates. All other prizes will be awarded as door prizes that everyone will qualify for!
- Shields are an obvious choice, you get the equip stats of the shield as well as a % chance to block incoming damage a certain number of times per turn, a la Dual Weapon Mastery's parry. Frenzied Focus lets it block more things per turn, raises the block chance to 100%, and applies Riposte.
- I dunno what could happen for tools beyond being able to wear/use two at once. Frenzied Focus can maybe make you activate the tool without putting it on cooldown? Could be pretty OP for some certain artifacts, and hilariously awesome for others. Really though, the ability to wear and use two tools at once is enough to make me seriously consider doing so if I didn't already have something great in the TK slot.
- I also think that having something special for having NOTHING in the TK slot would be thematically appropriate as well. Either make Beyond the Flesh passively attack things around you for low damage while there's nothing in the slot, maybe even inflicting grapples ("Your telekinetic forces lash out unconsciously for something to seize!") or have your telekinetic forces focus inside instead of outside, giving passive character buffs while there is no item in the TK slot.

Because of continuity and timeline errors, I've given up writing fanfiction based on the 1987-1996 animated television series. Instead, I'm trying to reboot the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles story, something many other fanfiction writers alredy do:
Some junkie in Ausgaylia died on the street because an angry mob of 80 something bogans started attacking the paramedics. No reason as to why they would do that is given.
The article then explains that in the state of Victoria this happens often enough that they had to make a law that makes attacking paramedics a felony on par with murder and rape to try to prevent it from happening.
My first instinct was that they just wanted another junkie to die, but apparently after the paramedics barricaded themselves in the ambulance the bogan crowd was demanding a defibrillator so they could revive the guy themselves, so apparently, that wasn't it.
I just woke up to this chit and havent had enough time to look too deeply into the situation, most reports have been pretty vague, but an ex of mine worked for the ambulance services and paramedics get assaulted all the time, sometimes its drugs, mental illness, sometimes its just kunts. There are enclaves where certain groups of people may make treating people too dangerous. Im sure more info will come out about it today and it will probably be as ****ing stupid as it sounds
I hope an angry mob forms on paramedics if anybody ever calls them for me. I'd rather die than pay that bill.
Depends on what they have to do inside of the ambulance itself when you're on the way to the hospital. But you're looking at some grands. Probably about five.
Catch a helicopter ride sometime, my Dad's Lifeflight lift was 64k to the closest hospital,,,,his end was 3k after insurance, if I remember correctly.
OK I read the article and there’s just no making sense of it. Gotta be druggies or something. It’s incredibly stupid.
8am indicates they had been up for at least 3 hours slamming some morning stubbies before they saw their mate being electrocuted by these uniformed terrorists with defibs and charged in to save the day
I can verify this as I absorbed the bill for a close relative, the helicopter paramedic said and I quote "it's a life & death situation, sign this" -
LOL, the state took my state income tax return for like 3 years to force me to pay off an ambulance bill. I'll catch my ride from now on, thank you very much
How else do you explain this BS. I noticed they specifically avoided stating what nationality the culprits were. A quick google search and riverwood is less then 40% australian born. Considering Sidney's gang problems etc here I'm finding it hard not to point my finger...
literally nothing on mainstream news about this, I happened to run into friend of mine today who is a journo for The Australian which is the left leaning business minded broadsheet. She said that apparently it was in a Lebanese / Arab community and the patient was in anifeleptic shock followed by cardiac arrest. The two paramedics that arrived were both female and the parent and male guardians around them flipped tf out and didn't want their son worked on by female paramedics / doctors. The street is majority of this background and as it was school run time a lot of the attackers were already outside. Also important is the numbers reported in this article were vastly overexagerrated and it was more like 30 people yelling at the ambo's and 12 police called. No riot gear - just patrol cars. Two of the men there were doctors begging for the equipment to use themselves.
Wasn't junkies. Some muslim bloke who was allergic to something came into contact with it and couldnt get his epipen. Whoever saw him freaked and called 000 - wimmen ambos came and Muslim community said GTFO im a doctoer gimme the paddles, ambos freaked at all the yelling and called the cops. Bloke died. Media blackout because of the extreme right already hating on Muslims in this country.
Really? Man that is **** ridiculous, don't agree with hating on a community but that's just dumb prejudices they've carried over from there own countries.
Not meaning to sound like a **** but I would only send female ambulances till they get the point. Bet all that petty **** goes out the window once they've helped save a few lives and delivered a few babies.
Newsweek literally copied the Austrialians article word for word, I originally read their article on my phone at work.
you read the australians article online? its paid subscription only. How'd you get your hands on that? Also, well it is Newscorp, you know Rupert Murdoch? the guy that owns the majority of the world mainstream media? to say it wouldn't be the first time misinformation has been reported by them would be kind of an understatement.
edit - my bad they do have headlines on for free. Its been a while since i worked for NewsLTD. They werent the first to report this, it was a leak from a small independant rag with 450 facebook supporters. It seems to have gained traction over here now. Shes a senior writer over there and I trust her to not bs me
It was available for free on my iphone news app. I was able to read the entire article, and then when I got home and was going to post it here the website was all ****ed up so I went with the newsweek article that was copy and pasted from them.
My mom had to use one about 6 ish months back. We were having dinner and she went into either some allergic reaction, or asthma attack. Got to a point she could barely breath.
That ride cost her I believe around 150. Then her insurance covered that so she was not out of pocket for anything.
Idiots and their old school cultures. So the guy they wanted to live died because they are to stupid to let some broads save him, makes sense.
I read about some nurse, or paramedics, or possibly even female doctors at a Sumo competition in Japan going to help someone on the mat that was in distress, the referee wouldnt allow them to help because the rules state no females allowed on the mat.
The Sumo association came out later and apologized saying the rules are the rules, but these women should have been allowed to help considering. So at least they recognized that they were wrong.
theres plenty of religious minorities that have stupid chit like refuding treatment bc god will save them, they're equally rediculous.
Not sure if srs because he does kinda have that low brow sense of humor and strikes me as rugged i.e. competent & self reliant but not too worldly or proper. He seems much classier than a redneck & he's definitely not an ignorant idiot. So if he really is Bogan it's only the good parts.
Theres plenty of great religious people, but they would be great people without the religion as well.
So that would mean its a corpse thats been poisoned by a level 99 spider, kicked apart into pieces by somebodies pet kangaroo, and then chewed up by a crocodile and left to rot only for a kookaburra to eat up the my remains and build a nest out of the hair under his old gum tree?
the land where everything will kill or eat you. the spiders are so big that they have health bars. and its the only place where you can get drunk off Fosters and box a kangaroo.
theres great pride in being a bogan. Most tradies for instance would be considered by the "upper class" (lel) to be bogans. It's effectively the white collars attempt at an insulting nickname for the blue collar worker.
I understand TC is an Aussie, and that he seems like a good guy. But I worked with a LOT of Australians and 100% of the time got the impression that the term bogan had no positive connotations. Was always used in a negative sense.
A buddy and I are looking to build a slider this fall. We have a dock that is an l shape at the end with about a 20' section at the end. What would be the best way to attach a slider to this with screwing PVC directly into the top of the dock? We are thinking a 2x8 or 2x10 then using some type of clamp deign (screwing another board under to 2x8-10 through gaps in the top of the dock). What other ideas would work?

Lower Peirce Reservoir, officially opened on 26 March 1912, is the second-oldest impounding reservoir in Singapore. Built at the lower portion of Kallang River in 1910, the reservoir was originally known as Kalang (Kallang) River Reservoir. It was renamed Peirce Reservoir in 1922 to commemorate the service of Robert Peirce, municipal engineer of Singapore from 1901 to 1916.1 The Upper Peirce Reservoir was created upstream of the existing one in 1975, following which the older reservoir was renamed Lower Peirce Reservoir.2
By the 1850s, Singapore was facing an increasing demand for freshwater due to population growth and greater sanitary concerns. Singapore’s first reservoir, Impounding Reservoir (known today as MacRitchie Reservoir), was built in 1868 to address the issue; however, it soon proved inadequate by the turn of the century with the rapid development of the town and port, coupled with a burgeoning population.3
As early as 1889, then Municipal Engineer James MacRitchie had planned to increase the water supply in Singapore by constructing a tunnel to divert water from Kallang River to Impounding Reservoir. However, this idea was aborted when MacRitchie diverted his attention to works at Impounding Reservoir.4 By 1897, some 1,400 ac (566 ha) of land at Kallang River had been set aside and approved by the municipality for the implementation of MacRitchie’s plan, which was then carried out by his successor, Samuel Tomlinson.5 By December 1902, the Kallang tunnel project had begun, following Peirce’s appointment as the new municipal engineer.6 After resolving a series of issues plaguing the project,7 which came to be referred to as the Kallang Tunnel Works, it was eventually completed in 1907. Following its completion, Singapore’s daily water supply was increased to 5.5 million gallons (25,000 cu m) from around 4 million gallons (18,184 cu m) in 1899.8
In February 1902, while construction of the Kallang Tunnel Works was still underway, Peirce proposed a scheme to construct a second reservoir at Kallang by building an embankment across the valley of Kallang River. The plan was motivated by the forecast of continued water shortage even after the tunnel was completed.9 It was estimated then that Singapore would need at least 6.5 million gallons (29,549 cu m) of water daily by 1910.10
In 1904, the municipality granted approval for the project; two years later, construction commenced. The reservoir, with a total catchment area of 3,007 ac (1,216 ha; including the upper-stream portion of the Kallang Tunnel Works),11 was completed in 1910. The tender for the projected was awarded to London’s Westminster Construction Company for 967,641 Straits dollars.12
The new reservoir had a storage capacity of at least 750 million gallons (3.4 million cu m) and supplied 3.5 million gallons (15,911 cu m) per day, increasing the total daily water supply to some 9 million gallons (40,914 cu m).13
The Kalang (old spelling of “Kallang”) River Reservoir was officially opened on 26 March 1912 by then Governor John Anderson. For the event, a commemorative stone was specially imported from Aswan, Egypt, and laid at the reservoir. The stone can still be found at the reservoir today.14
A decade later, in 1922, the reservoir was renamed Peirce Reservoir in honour of the municipal engineer who served in the position from 1901 to 1916.15
In 1970, the Public Utilities Board engaged Binnie & Partners (Singapore) to conduct feasibility studies for the construction of a new reservoir in the vicinity of Peirce Reservoir as well as to implement the project.16 The site was found to be suitable and construction started in May 1972. The works included the building of a 30-metre-high, 350-metre-long earth dam upstream of the existing dam, hence creating a new reservoir upstream of the existing one. This new reservoir was named Upper Peirce Reservoir, while the older reservoir was accordingly renamed Lower Peirce Reservoir.17
The Upper Peirce Reservoir project consisted of the main dam, four secondary dams around it to prevent water spillage into the surrounding grounds, a water-treatment plant and two conveyance towers.18 The entire project was completed in 1975 at a cost of at least S$55 million, of which S$17 million was financed by a loan from the Commonwealth Development Corporation.19 At the time of its completion, Upper Peirce Reservoir was the largest reservoir in Singapore: It had a water storage capacity of around 6.1 billion gallons (27.8 million cu m), more than seven times that of Lower Peirce Reservoir.20 It was officially opened by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 27 February 1977.21
Water currently circulates between the Marina Reservoir and Upper Peirce Reservoir via tunnels to ensure the water’s freshness.22
Together, MacRitchie, Upper Seletar (the third impounding reservoir constructed in Singapore), Upper Peirce and Lower Peirce reservoirs form the Central Catchment Nature Reserve. All of these reservoirs are designated as protected catchments, which means that development is prohibited there so as to preserve the ecological balance in these areas and minimise the risk of pollution. Hence, water from protected catchments is generally of a higher quality compared with other sources.23
In 1950, the Municipal Council announced that power stations, reservoirs and sewage works were classified as protected places and no longer accessible to the public unless passes were obtained from the council.24 This decision was reversed in 1979 with the opening of the five-hectare Upper Peirce Reservoir Park next to the reservoir.25
The forest surrounding the Lower and Upper Peirce reservoirs is a mature secondary rainforest, with some trees estimated to be over a hundred years old. Rubber trees and oil palms, remnants of former plantations, are found near the reservoir.26 The nature reserve surrounding the reservoirs has been recommended for bird watching and nature strolls.27 Fishing, swimming and poaching at the reservoirs are, however, prohibited due to their protected status.28 There are some 900 flowering plants, 100 ferns and 250 animal species found in the Lower Peirce Reservoir area. These include the jambu laut (Malay for “sea apple”) tree, nibong palm and pitcher plants. Wildlife such as the water monitor lizard, oriental whip snake and the long-tailed macaque also inhabit the area.29 In 1999, a 900-metre boardwalk, the Lower Peirce Trail, was opened for public use.30
In 1992, the Nature Society (Singapore) carried out a conservation study on the impact of building a golf course at the forested area next to the Lower Peirce Reservoir. In the report, the society accorded the nature reserve at Lower Peirce the highest rating of five stars.31 The proposed 120-hectare (296 ac) golf course did not materialise.32
In 2008, the Urban Redevelopment Authority announced the extension of its conservation efforts to include towers, bridges and structures other than buildings. Following the policy change, the water intake tower and bridge at Lower Peirce Reservoir were gazetted for conservation on 3 December 2009.33

Millions of Nerves travel throughout the human frame to control the function and physiology of your body. Spinal joints that are out of alignment or not moving properly can affect your health by irritating delicate spinal nerves. When irritated, these nerves alert your brain that something is wrong. Symptoms, including pain, are usually the result. Nerve signals are also sent to your muscles to stabilize and protect the area. You may feel stiff, sore, and tired. As opposed to taking pain masking drugs, which can be dangerous to your health, Chiropractic care seeks to locate the source of your symptoms and address the underlying cause, so the problem doesnt keep recurring.
Your chiropractic doctor will consult with you about your health and perform a complete examination to identify your problem areas. Youll be given a report of the doctors findings and an opportunity to have all of your questions answered. Chiropractic adjusting with the Impulse Adjusting Instrument® aims to restore your bodys balance and function to correct the underlying cause of your symptoms with treatments that are as painless as possible. Getting you back to feeling yourself again quickly and effectively are our primary goals.
What does it feel like? Chiropractic adjustments with the Impulse Adjusting Instrument® feel like a light tapping sensation on the area that is being treated. In most cases the treatment is painless and after the adjustment many patients feel relief of pain and improved mobility. Others report a sense of well-being or a soothing calm feeling. Of course, results vary from case to case and chronic conditions, inflammation or muscle spasms may delay these positive effects.

A business is after making profits and growing to serve large number of customers than it initially started with. For this to be realized however , it means that business owners need to invest in marketing. Marketing takes the business to the consumer and that way the consumer gets to know what they can be offered. Through marketing , a customer will not only learn about a business but also why it’s better than the competition. The dawn of the internet has made a lot of things easier one of them being marketing which is more effective and easier for those who are in charge. There are domains where you will be required to pay for services of marketing your heating business but others come free and all you have to do is express your business in good light.
For those that require you to pay, they will have good traffic and fresh content regularly. Free of charge means of marketing your business has a way of spreading your content over a lot of platforms also. Online marketing strategies have different result rates and using all of them together is assured to give you much needed results. Heating companies are not after one time success, they want to make an impact for as long as they can and become the most preferred option by their clients. Blogs are such platforms, they should be very informative on anything the clients will require such as under floor heating which is becoming a subject of interest.
Blogs need to be updated on a regular basis, that shows the client that you are thinking about them. Social media has become the next big thing to turn to when it comes to marketing , marketers need to get on it and roll with how it goes as they could change the whole game from that position. The dawn of social media has turned the world into a community literally and the avenues are characterized with huge client base and good interactive forums ,any service heating contractor will be missing out if business has not adapted to the platform already. Video marketing is very captivating for clients who want to understand the procedures of the service that you are going to offer them.
Mock demonstration are very efficient especially for customers who are reserved to buy a heating service until they work as required. E mail marketing works by sending the customer important information of services and new information that may prompt the client to do business with the heat service contractor. Reviews by customers ensure that a business knows where to improve on and hence make strategies for bettering themselves.

The Large-blotched Ensatina is found in pine-oak woodlands from the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California to the Sierra San Pedro Mártir in Baja California. In the Atlas region, this species is found in isolated mountain top populations in Riverside County (including the San Jacinto Mountains, Santa Rosa Mountains, and Cahuilla Mountain), San Diego County (Palomar Mountain, Laguna Mountains, Cuyamaca Mountains), and isolated populations in Baja California (Sierra Juárez, Sierra San Pedro Mártir). An additional isolated population in Baja California is located on near the coast on Volcán Riveroll at 70 meters in elevation; a location uncharacteristic for the species.
As part of our Eco Journey policy, we have started an initiative supporting the planting of trees at Paga located at the northern top most part of Ghana through an NGO called SYTO Ghana. Tree planting activity provides local employment and protects the environment. These trees subsequently become a source of income for the community. If you wish to offset the carbon from your flight we can plant trees for you at a cost of $3.00 a tree. This will pay for the planting, manure, watering and protection for the first 2 years of the trees life until it is established .Because much of our activities on this trip are spent along the beach, and we have the responsibility for conserving the beaches. We therefore do not encourage driving along the beach in order to avoid sand compaction. As a measure of conserving the environment, we do inform our clients not to take away any natural materials like fossil.
Our community support efforts come in various forms. We create contractual jobs for the local people by the tour guides we engage on this trip. All the tour guides are from the communities who have in-depth knowledge of the local communities and their cultures. We help sustain the local economy by the entrance fees we pay to the site managers. These fees are their source of income which also keeps them on their job. We do rent vehicles from our local transport suppliers who hails from the local area to pick our clients from Accra and drive them during the entire trip . The payment of the vehicle rental to local transporter ensures that income is maintained at the local community we send the travelers
All our accommodations on this trip are locally owned and run. We engage the local people in business by patronizing their local eco lodges/ accommodation facilities which give earns them a living. Although we allow our clients the choice to some continental dishes, most of the meals on the trip are delicious locally prepared food. By interacting with the local people, we encourage relationships building thereby enabling the travelers to have ever lasting memories about the trip.
We loved all of it but highlights would include seeing how different life in Ghana is from ours; chatting to the people, especially the children; trekking along the beautiful coastline; watching the baby turtles make their way to the sea; seeing the beautiful old ruins of the former days; and seeing the cocoa farms...

(6) Muhammad bin Ya'qoob narrated from Abul Qassim bin al-Ala’ al-Hamadani that Abdul Aziz bin Muslim had said: We were with Imam ar-Redha (as) in Marw. We met with our companions in the mosque on Friday. They discussed the matter of the imamate. They mentioned how much disagreement there was about this subject. I came to my master Imam ar-Redha (as) and told him of what people had discussed. He smiled and said:
churumuri.com records with profound regret the passing away of K. Pattabhi Jois, the legendary yoga guru, in Mysore on Monday afternoon. He was 94 years old, and had been ailing for some time.
Jois, born in tiny Kowshika in Hassan district, put Ashtanga yoga on the map of the world and was singularly responsible for restoring Mysore’s rightful place as the yoga capital in the country.
Starting out from a tiny nook in Lakshmipuram, Jois taught the way to achieve the union between the jeevatma and the paramatma. And on any given day, Gokulam, where he resided, resembled an Olympics Games village, with hundreds of foreigners practising the craft at the hands of Jois and his grandson, Sharath Rangaswamy.
“Ashtanga was introduced to the west from India by Pattabhi Jois—or Guruji. At the age of 12, Jois started studying with the guru Krishnamacharya who, in the early 20th century, revived the millennia-old practice of yoga. Jois visited California in 1975, and America was hooked. Jois’s six series of poses are the ashtanga practised today. He believes you must master each pose before you can proceed to the next (the only person certified to practise the sixth series, apart from himself, is his grandson).”
SUNAAD RAGHURAM writes: Like all of us, he too is playing host to age. But age, in his case, seems to be a casual cousin who just dropped by. Not a long staying relative who bears upon you the burden of his visit’s upkeep.
He’s more like a sun kissed flower. Vibrant, colourful, joyous and bright. Age alights upon him like a bee and buzzes off in an instant.
K. Pattabhi Jois has seen 91 summers. Or winters, if you like. But… But the eyes still flash bright hues. The smile is friendly and full. It doesn’t matter that it is denture assisted. The skin is taut and blemishless.
So much like his resolve to do what he has been doing in stages almost every waking moment for 77 of his 91 years. Learning, lecturing and teaching yoga. His has been a journey. Long, timeless, poignant, exciting, frustrating, fulfilling and in a sense, eternal.
Perhaps the greatest living guru of ashtanga yoga in the world, Jois lives in Gokulam, Mysore. If he is not teaching in London or Paris or Melbourne or New York or San Francisco, that is. His is the life of a man whose soul has been satiated by the sheer attainment of a life’s ambition; the fulfilling of a karmic yearning; the continuing of a tradition that is steeped in his very being.
To him life is yoga. And yoga is life. There is nothing beyond it. Not anything that he has tried seeking. He ran away from his home in the village of Kowshika near Hassan as a 14-year-old boy. Getting into the train to Mysore from the station at Ambuga, a neighbouring village, four miles away, because he didn’t want any one to notice him or even recognize him.
Watching guru S.T. Krishnamacharya demonstrate yoga at the Jubilee Hall in Hassan one 1928 evening, stirring in him some irresistible awakening. “It’s the shaping of the soul over many lives,” he says. His answer to why he got so irrevocably drawn to the pursuit of yoga. Long years of ‘tapas’. At the Sanskrit College in Mysore.
In the early days, the meals were frugal but the insults to the heart were substantial. Poverty snapped at his heels like a persistent dog. He could only glare back and keep going. His resolve was cast in solid iron and his mind wavered only as much as a mountain would against a mild breezy waft.
The numbing sacrifices in life. The honing of his very internal rhythms to suit the lifestyle of a yogi. From an unearthly young age. Waking up at 4 in the morning. When the rest of the world remained snugly curled up in the folds of a hazy dream. Pushing his limbs to do the mind’s bidding. Yoga practice. And more of it until the sun was high up in the sky. Day after day. Week after week. Years went by.
There is to him the visage of a yogi. The mellow glow of knowledge and achievement. But there is not even a hint of the ego. Quite surrealistically humble. He doesn’t speak the English language beyond the customary ‘hello’ and ‘thank you’.
Yet there’s some unbelievable communion happening all the time between him and his tens of hundreds of western students. They call him guruji. And in return they get a soulful of benediction. Or so it seems going by the way they fawn over his presence.
I have seen him walk the long cavernous halls of airports in the west amidst the gloss, the glitter, the lights and the shrill crescendo of revved up jet engines taxiing for take off. But he is his own self. In his white dhoti and shirt and pump shoes.
He neither understands the thousand reasons his co-passengers have to be on the same plane nor does he want to know why else the world moves. To him he is on his way to Los Angeles or Encinitas or Hawaii because a student has invited him to be there.

He was a legend and popularized his own style of Vinyasa. This is a more dynamic and movement based yoga sequence as compared to static poses of traditional yoga. He was an innovator with a firm foundation in traditional yoga. Now there are several blends of western yoga forms derived from Pattabhi Jois’s ashtanga yoga.
Krishnamacharya and his two disciples Pattabhi Jois and BKS Iyengar can be considered as the trimurthi of modern Yoga rennaissence. These three gems of the ‘Mysore Yoga Shala’ have made Yoga global and a household word all over the world. It is also important to understand that all these three Gurus were householders who led a normal married family life with children and grandchildren. They removed the sterotype of the yogis who live in Himalayas renouncing all cares.
Incidentally all of them lived for long years – Iyengar is still fit as a fiddle at 91. Krishnamacharya lived to be 103 and now Pattabhi is no more at 94. Another of Krishnamachrya’s disciple Indira Devi lived for 102 years. J Krishnamurthi also a yoga practitioner from this tradition lived upto 91. There is really something about this tradition.
His style was called ‘Mysore Yoga’. In fact world over it was common among Yoga practioners to use the word ‘Mysore’ as a Yogic noun, verb and a way of life. Singularly what he did for Yoga and Mysore is phenomenal. Like Edison, his famous quote is:’Yoga is 1% theory and 99% Practice’!
I have seen him often when I was a small boy. Joisru would come to the Stadium (Maharaja’s college ground) in the morning and sit there and do some asanas and we as small boys would watch in wonder He must have been 40+ those days. Once I was there with my brother and when Joisru was doing Shirasasana he lost balance and fell flat and I laughed and got beaten up as we went home. I will never forget this and I learnt Srisasana and did it well for decades later!
At least his brother-disciple was honoured with a Padma Sri, when I see men like him not being recognised, and immature, loudmouth brass-collars getting all the recognition and accolades, I wonder what sort of creatures these politicians must be. :(
Is asking for the road that leads up to Doctors’ Corner from Vontikoppal Police Station as Pattabhi Jois Road, too much?
I know that the road also houses of the legendary Mysore Engineers’ families but the contribution of Jois’ enterprise(no offense meant!) to that locality and specifically that road is HUGE.
I am not suggesting to name any road in the venerable Lakshmipuram and AFAIK, this road has no memorable name too.
Who is the corporator in Gokulam? Vontikoppal(this part of the road’s)’s corporator is that rowdy who supposedly(and thankfully) is not showing his face to the people.
His style was called ‘Mysore Yoga’. In fact world over it was common among Yoga practioners to use the word ‘Mysore’ as a Yogic noun, verb and a way of life. Singularly what he did for Yoga and Mysore is phenomenal. Like Edison, his famous quote is:’Yoga is 9% theory and 91% Practice’!
I have been slowly working through my collection of games that I have that I have not yet played. Granted, some of those games have not actually been played, but I have played other people’s copies of them (and that counts for something).
And, with International TableTop Day just around the corner, it seems like a great time to look at that collection and pick out a few from the pile that I have not yet played, especially since I am planning on making TableTop Day a 24 hour event.
One of the oldest games in my collection (at least, one that I have had the longest), Zombies!!! is a game that just has not ever made it to the table.
The game itself is pretty simple. Players try to escape a zombie infested city that grows with each tile the players draw on their turn until they find the helipad (and rescue), or kill 25 zombies.
It is not the best zombie game out there, having been surpassed by the likes of Last Night on Earth, Dead of Winter, and Zombicide. But, it still sits in my collection waiting to be played at least once. And TableTop Day seems like a good time to pull out this lighter, yet sprawly board game.
Pandemic has become well known, spawning many expansions and a few spin-off games. Since Pandemic is cooperative, I have been able to solo my way through that game. And I have managed to play Pandemic The Cure a couple of times.
Which leaves Pandemic Contagion, the game where the players become the diseases they have fought to wipe out in the other games. I’m hoping that TableTop Day will finally be the day I can get this one to the table.
Then I’ll start worrying about the expansions to the original game, and Pandemic Legacy when it comes out.
I have managed to play Mister Jack Pocket and Le Fantome de l’Opera, which some people have described as Mister Jack in Paris. But I have yet to actually play Mister Jack itself.
The game itself is a deduction game pitting two players against each other in a race against time. One player is the notorious Mister Jack, trying to escape detection, while the other tries to discover who is Mister Jack really is before he (or she) escapes.
Mister Jack is strictly a two player game, which has not worked all that well for larger groups. I am hoping that TableTop Day will allow for some time where I can break out this two player game for a couple of plays before diving back into the big group games that will tend to dominate the day.
Zooloretto is a bit different than some of the other games previously on this list. There is no killing zombies, no infecting the world, or even trying to find an infamous murderer. Zooloretto has the players building and populating zoos.
Each round, “trucks” are loaded with animals and concession stands. Players will take one of these trucks and place the objects in their zoo. If they do not have room, then they go to the barn. Points are scored by filling areas and lost by having animals in the barn.
Another of Fantasy Flight Games’ many Cthulhu based board games. Mansions of Madness looked really cool when I picked it up. But, it has since sat on my shelf unplayed, mostly due to the extremely difficult set up and the need for at least two players. But, with the plan for TableTop Day to be an all-day event (literally), there is a good chance that a longer game with a long set up could hit the table.
As many of you know, I have been quite the Star Wars X-Wing player for a while now. I have a number of squads created and prepared to bring to the table. But, lately, I just have not been all that into playing it.
Part of it is just burn out. For probably a year or so, I have been playing X-wing on Sundays, which is convenient for me because that and Monday are the days I have off during the week. Even not playing a few Sundays for holidays or because I was called into work, that’s quite a few Sundays. And while I have played many different squads, the battles are usually the same: straight on dogfights to the last ship. Even varying what squad I play, or even what faction, it is the same thing over and over.
It did not help that store tournaments got moved to a day I can’t participate in either. Not that I really competed in them. Usually, I would lose those, mostly because it was a straight up dog fight and I would end up out flown and out gunned.
The big reason why I have not been getting into the X-Wing games lately is that I’ve started up with the Dungeons and Dragons Attack Wing games. The two games have their similarities, but lately I have been liking the DnD Attack Wing stuff so much more. There is a mix of ground and flying creatures that adds in an aspect that X-Wing just does not have. And, while the price point for the Attack Wing minis is roughly about the same as the X-Wing minis, I do not feel the need to buy six Sun Elf Wizards to make a good squad, where I had to buy multiple TIE Fighters just to make a competitive squad.
Even the tournaments are different, and better. X-wing has you build a 100 point squad that is either Imperial or Rebel (or Scum, now that that faction is out). Attack Wing has you build a 90 point squad, with an additional 30 points coming from a blind booster. So, even when you don’t win a DnD tournament, you are still getting a figure that is not out on the market yet, along with the various spell cards that come with that figure. The DnD tournaments are also set up around scenarios. You are not just destroying your opponent, but trying to complete a mission that is different for each tournament.
Even the prizes are different… and better. First place for the last X-Wing tournament I played in was a plaque. Nice, sure, but it’s just a plaque. First place for the DnD tournament was a dragon, one that can be used in future games and tournaments. Even second place was better than the “medal” that they have for the X-Wing tournaments: it’s another dragon.
So, I see myself potentially drifting away from X-Wing and more towards Attack Wing unless something really cool comes out. At this point, I really am not sure what that really would be.
As I have been picking away (slowly) at the number of games I have yet to play in my collection, I have noticed that there are a few of them that, frankly, I have a lesser desire to play. Some of the games I have played, and some I have not. Many of these games are not really have I hate. They are just games that I just really don’t want to play. At least, they are not games that I want to play a lot.
And, for the record, there are 102 games in my collection that I have not played in some way or another.

The sounds of sewage trickling through the sewer system and Fry's own slow, steady footsteps filled his ears as he walked cautiously into a dark alley between two dilapidated buildings. Hermes followed several feet behind him, moving equally as stealthily despite his weight.
Looking ahead, Fry could see that the alley turned left. Nearing the turn, he put his back against the wall to his left and pulled his 9mm pistol out of its holster. Sucking in a deep breath of foul sewer air, he spun around and moved into the corner, aiming the gun down the dim alley ahead of him.
A sharp "shh" from behind him almost made him jump. He turned around to see Hermes holding a finger over his lips, glaring at him in frustration. This was the second time so far that Fry had nearly given away their presence.
Fry turned away from Hermes so he couldn't see the annoyed look on his face. Sneaking around New New York in black combat fatigues and trying to avoid discovery was not how he wanted to spend the rainiest night of 3008.
This whole mess began about six months ago in March, when Fry first started to hear about civilian disappearances on Channel √2 News. Since the reports started out few and far between, Fry gave them no thought. But about a month later, the reports started to become more and more frequent, with several humans announced missing every day.
It was then that even Fry began to notice that something was seriously wrong within New New York. With every passing day, the streets looked increasingly deserted, with fewer people walking around and using the transport tubes.
Fry started to wonder what was going on. So far, only adult humans, male and female, had been reported missing; no robots or aliens had disappeared.
As two months passed, Fry's unease about the situation worsened as people he knew or was familiar with began to vanish. Amy stopped showing up for work, and none of the Planet Express crew had seen her since. Linda van Schoonhoven became permanently absent from Channel √2 News, leaving Morbo as the show's only anchor. With every new report of a missing human, Morbo's tone sounded more aggressively ecstatic.
Finally, the remaining crew members showed up at Planet Express one morning to find the Professor missing. With no one to take orders from and no one to replace the Professor, the crew had no choice but to leave Planet Express and seek employment elsewhere.
Fry, Leela, Bender and Hermes didn't have to job hunt for long. Several days after the Professor's disappearance, they were contacted by the EIB (Earthican Information Bureau), which was searching for new recruits. Fry initially refused to join due to the name of the organization alone, expecting to have to undertake a dull and mundane bureaucratic job like Hermes had.
As it turned out, paperwork was only a fraction of what the EIB dealt with. The organization was designed to gather and examine data about domestic and interplanetary terrorist threats, and was commonly referred to as "the eyes and ears of Earth's government" by the public. But what the public didn't know was that the EIB was involved with numerous other organizations, including Earth's army, the ODC (Office of Disease Control), prestigious scientists, and major businesses.
The EIB's intent was to enlist Fry and his coworkers in a special covert action team to counter the threat facing New New York's human population. Excluding Hermes, they already had some experience in military combat when they served under Earth's army eight years earlier.
For the next three months, Fry and his coworkers underwent further combat training and learned that the mass civilian disappearances were being caused by vampire-like creatures that the EIB referred to as "nightwalkers".
Based on the holographic images that they were shown in training, nightwalkers appeared as humanoids with deathly pale skin, animalistic eyes, and elongated, razor-sharp canine teeth and claws. They multiplied by feeding on human blood and transforming their victims into one of their own. Fry's superiors also noted that just one or two slash attacks from a nightwalker's claws would result in death for a human. Given that nightwalkers could also easily outrun the most athletic humans and leap over buildings several stories high, it was no wonder that so much of New New York's population had fallen prey to these creatures.
In addition to learning about the nightwalkers, Fry and his comrades were also taught how to utilize various types of military-issued equipment and weapons, which included pistols, assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, anti-materiel rifles, and technologically advanced knives called UV knives. The knives were battery-powered, and stabbing a target with one of their blades would release deadly ultraviolet rays into its body and cause it to incinerate due to the rays' extreme intensity.
Throughout his training, Fry felt as though he was being worked harder as a soldier than he could remember. This was due to the fact that he and his allies had only three months to train before the night they would have to undertake their mission, which they could not afford to fail. Monthly weather forecasts predicted lengthy periods of rainfall in early September. Since the nightwalkers' acute senses were dulled by rain, the precipitation would give Fry and his team the fighting chance that they needed. According to the ODC's calculations, if they didn't react to the threat soon, the nightwalker population would exceed that of humans worldwide by 3011.
Their chance to fight back came on the second night of September, a dreary night if there ever was one; rain poured like bullets from thick gray clouds that blanketed a starless black sky illuminated occasionally by jagged white streaks of lightning. Fry, Leela, Bender and Hermes were deployed to the streets of New New York that night at 9:00 PM sharp at a location that the EIB had designated as Point E32. The command vehicle they rode in looked like an ordinary hover van on the outside, but was loaded with detection devices and equipment for communication and analysis on the inside. The equipment would allow them to view information from UAVs and EIB headquarters so they could devise tactics and always stay one step ahead of the nightwalkers.
To help them blend in with their dark surroundings, Fry, Leela and Hermes were each decked out in completely black night combat uniforms which included snug-fitting long-sleeved shirts, protective vests, gloves, fatigue pants, combat boots, and holders for their weapons, ammunition, and transmitters. They also wore headsets with small microphones for communication and displays that could be lowered over the user's left eye (Leela's display was custom-built for her single eye). The display's functions included the ability to see uploaded images as well as a radar, telescopic view, night vision, and necrovision. Necrovision was a special view that displayed different colored auras on targets depending on their species; it would be especially useful against nightwalkers since they had the ability to take on human forms.
Unlike his other teammates, Bender didn't wear a uniform; his body was dyed black and he had all of his equipment strapped on where necessary. He also had no need for a head-mounted display, as he had all of its functions programmed into his eyes.
The team's ultimate goal was to track down and destroy the prime walker who ruled over New New York. Upon a prime walker's death, all other nightwalkers that it spawned would be reduced to ashes, effectively purging the city of the nightwalker threat. Unfortunately, the prime's identity and whereabouts were currently unknown to the EIB. The advance team that had been sent prior to Fry's squad had supposedly obtained intelligence on the prime walker, but the EIB had failed to make any contact with them despite their efforts.
As Fry, Leela and Hermes stepped out of the warm, dry command vehicle into the dark, rain-soaked city for their first objective, Fry felt a chill run down his spine as the cold, falling drops hit his face and seeped through his carrot-colored hair for the first time that night. Despite all the equipment he had and the extensive training he and his teammates had underwent, he still felt afraid and unprepared for the long, danger-filled night ahead of him.
Now, Fry and Hermes were carefully working their way through Sewer City in an effort to avoid detection, as traveling at ground level had proven to be too risky.
As Fry stepped timidly through the alley, he found it to be too dark for his liking. He reached a hand up to his headset and groped around for the button that would activate night vision. The first button he pressed displayed his view in a hazy monochrome and showed Hermes and himself as glowing green figures; that was necrovision. The second button, thankfully, provided Fry with a fully lit view of the alley bathed in an emerald green luminescence.
Advancing further into the alley, Fry heard distant footsteps coming from around the corner he was headed toward. They were quick, frantic footsteps headed in his direction.
Both Fry and Hermes were armed with pistols and a few sixteen-round clips. Even though it wasn't the most powerful firearm in the universe, Fry would rather have a pistol than no weapon at all.
As the footsteps drew nearer, Fry froze in his tracks and looked back at Hermes. About one quarter of his face was covered by his display, but Fry could still see that he looked just about as nervous as he felt. Still, Hermes silently urged him to keep going forward.
Fry continued to creep ahead, inhaling and exhaling as quietly as he could. He wished Bender and Leela were with them so they'd have a better fighting chance if they had an enemy encounter. But Hermes, being ranked as their team leader, had ordered Bender to stay back in the command vehicle and try to establish contact with the advance recon team. Bender had grudgingly tried to call the advance team, but after about two minutes of getting no responses, he gave up and sat back with his feet on the desk, downing one of the six Olde Fortrans he had stashed in his compartment. Leela herself had stayed behind in the sewer by Hermes's request.
In the ten or so minutes he'd spent sneaking through the city with Hermes, Fry hadn't encountered any of the nightwalkers yet. But the disturbing sights he'd seen so far that night were enough to make him wish he was sound asleep in Bender's spacious closet back in Robot Arms Apartments.
For now, all Fry, Leela and Hermes had to do was head for the roof of a building where they'd meet up with some members of the advance team that were supposed to be there to provide them with better weaponry. To decrease their chances of being caught, Hermes sent Leela on her own and took Fry with him to keep an eye on him. But on their way to the rendezvous point, the two men ran into a problem.
Earlier on the city surface, Fry and Hermes were making their way through an alley that led out onto the street. Jogging past a dumpster with trash scattered around it, Fry accidentally kicked an empty Slurm can out onto the street. The can clattered into an area near some civilians. Fortunately, none of them bothered to investigate how the aluminum can had sailed out onto the street, as they were far more interested in the grisly scene that lay in front of them.
Peering around the corner, Fry and Hermes both saw that the civilians were gathered in front of a Fishy Joe's restaurant, staring and exchanging murmurs of shock and horror. Local cops Smitty and URL were busy hanging yellow and black POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS tape in front of the joint. In the center of the tape lay the lifeless body of Joseph Gilman, the restaurant chain's owner. Gilman rested belly-up on the ground, blood flowing out from deep lacerations in his stomach and puddling around his pudgy frame. His face was frozen in a permanent wide-eyed, open-mouthed expression of pure terror. His left arm had been torn clean out of its socket and lay sticking out from underneath a hover car parked nearby, the flabby appendage separated from its owner by a trail of gore spanning several feet.
Fry had to fight to keep his dinner from spewing forth from his mouth at the sight of the man who had literally been torn apart.
At that point, Hermes was unsure of where to go, since their pre-planned route was now blocked off by cops and civilians who wouldn't take kindly to them running around the city with loaded guns. He called up Leela to ask if she knew an alternate route to their destination.
Fortunately, she knew of a route they could take through Sewer City that would minimize their chances of being detected. She also knew of a manhole that led out right under the building they had to ascend. Hermes told Leela to hold her position and wait while he and Fry made their way over to her.
On their way to Leela, Fry and Hermes found a strange image on the side of a building that neither of them had seen there before. It looked like it had been drawn on the wall with what appeared to be human blood, apparently mixed with a hardener of sorts that prevented the rain from washing it away. The picture consisted of a vertical line that curved twice with a crescent shape drawn on its left and a circle with a dot in its center drawn on its right. To Fry, the image looked like crudely drawn male genitalia. Hermes, however, thought that the markings represented the astronomical symbols for the sun and moon, but he was unsure of their significance.
In the time that Fry and his two teammates had spent sneaking through the dimly lit, stench-filled city, the only sewer mutant they'd come across was Dwayne, whom they'd found lying facedown in a pool of his own blood, his bulbous forehead preventing his dual-nosed face from touching the wooden dock that served as a sidewalk over the sewage. Judging by the deep slashes that had been dug into his back, it was obvious to the three soldiers that he'd been killed by a nightwalker. This was a surprise to them, as they originally thought that nightwalkers only attacked humans.
As much as Leela hated to admit it, the fact that nightwalkers went after mutants as well as humans made her unsettled. Knowing that she could become a victim if one of the creatures got the drop on her, she couldn't help but feel a little on edge.
Hermes ordered Leela to stay behind and examine Dwayne's corpse while he and Fry went ahead, a task she was understandably not thrilled about. Leela was to catch up to them when she was finished.
As she knelt down to study the body, worried thoughts began to cloud Leela's head. It wasn't her own safety she feared for; she knew she could handle the nightwalkers. It was the lives of the other defenseless mutants she was concerned about, especially those of her parents. She wondered if her mother and father knew about the nightwalker threat and hoped that they were all right.
Listening to the nearing footsteps minutes after he'd left Leela behind, Fry wished that Hermes had brought her along with them. That way, he'd have had two able bodies to cower behind instead of just one if things got ugly.
As Fry neared the end of the alley, he found that it was bright enough to see without his night vision, so he shut it off. He then turned with his back against the wall to his left and slid along it until he reached the edge. Peering around the corner, he saw that the alley led back out to the dock that ran around the sewer block that he and Hermes were on.
Fry took a step past the corner — and froze suddenly. The hair on the back of his neck stood up on end. Through the thick sewer stench, his nostrils could faintly detect a subtle odor that pervaded the area around him. It was a sickeningly sweet, saccharine smell that reminded him of cheap body sprays.
Fry swallowed quietly. One of the few things he was able to remember from his combat training was that nightwalkers had a fine, cloying body odor that permeated any area they went. Remembering his superiors' descriptions of the scent, he shuddered as he realized that it was the same smell he sensed now. Knowing that there was a deadly, evil creature in close proximity to him, he hesitated to go any further.
Stealing a glance at Hermes coming up behind him, Fry could tell from his apprehensive expression that he was even tenser than when he last looked at him. Hermes paused uncertainly for a moment, then lightly bobbed his head forward at Fry, urging him to go on.
Fry and Hermes both crouched down and moved furtively with their backs pressed against the wall, heading out to the edge of the sewer block. Fry's heart started to race as he heard the footsteps coming closer and closer.
As he moved toward the end of the path, he heard a second set of footsteps approaching. Fry's heart rate increased exponentially. The new footsteps were even quicker and more urgent than the first, pounding against the dock as if whoever — or whatever — was making them wanted something desperately.
Continuing on his path, Fry breathed as quietly as he could. Beads of sweat rolled down his face as the footsteps grew louder, pounding in his ears. He fought to keep from gagging as the overly sweet odor grew stronger, filling his nostrils with its unpleasantness.
Fry realized at this point that he was intensely frightened now, since he was making every effort to be silent. The last thing he wanted to do was make any hostile aware of his presence. Besides, Hermes had already chewed him out for kicking the Slurm can out onto the street near civilians, and he didn't want to go through something like that again.
Wiping the perspiration from his face, Fry looked back and cast one more brief glance at Hermes. The team captain's face retained its agitated countenance, but was now accompanied by tears of sweat that made his nose and cheeks glisten.
I'm going forward, forward into possible death, Hermes's expression read. Not because I want to, but because I have to. And there's no telling if I'll survive or not.
Fry knew that feeling all too well; he had worked with Planet Express as an interplanetary delivery boy for over eight years.
When he was a few feet away from the end of the alley, Fry stopped and sat against the wall. He listened hard. The two pairs of footsteps were coming from around the corner on his left and were closing in on him.
Fry swallowed some saliva that had built up in his mouth and looked toward the dock. He lowered a hand to his chest and felt his heart beating furiously against his palm as his fear intensified.
A horrified shriek suddenly rang out mere feet from Fry's position and reverberated along the sewer walls, followed by a guttural, inhuman cry of attack. Fry winced as he heard a sharp, disgusting ripping sound that resembled Velcro being torn apart.
He saw a wave of blood splatter across the wooden dock. A pair of arm-length tentacles slapped against the dock, followed closely by a head topped with graying purple hair tied back in a neat bun.
Fry pieced together what had just happened. The first set of footsteps he'd heard wasn't a hostile at all; it was Turanga Munda running for her life. The second set of footsteps was a nightwalker chasing after her that had now succeeded in hunting the poor mutated woman down.
Upon seeing what the creature had done to Munda in just one strike, Fry wanted to turn tail and duck behind the 250-pound Jamaican barricade he had with him. But even he knew that that was a bad idea since his panicked, thumping footsteps would alert the walker to his presence, and he'd be dead as well.
For now, Fry was a sitting duck as he looked down at Munda, his face twisted in fear and sadness. She lay facedown on the dock, her pooled blood soaking her face and the front of her dress. She didn't move.
Staring at her for several seconds, Fry felt his stomach churn. He thought for sure that Munda was dead. To his amazement, her body twitched ever so slightly.
With what little life she had left, Munda tilted her head up and gazed pleadingly at Fry, her sole eye bulging in absolute terror and despair. Her mouth stood agape in a wide circle of fear, as if screaming, but no sound came out.
Fry could only stare back at her with utter remorse. He wanted with all of his heart to help her. But given the fact that it took almost a full clip of ammo to kill one of the creatures, it only meant he'd be feeding the thing three meals instead of one if they tried to fight it.
As Fry struggled to figure out what to do, Munda squeezed her eye shut and clenched her teeth, clinging to the dock as tightly as she could with her suction cups. But the walker yanked her back with such tremendous force, it ripped her tentacles free from the dock with a series of loud, rapid pops and violently extracted her from Fry's view.
In those brief seconds, Fry had formulated a plan. He would give the creature some distance, then leave cover and open fire on it, figuring it would ditch Munda to fight off the bigger threat — him. But he knew he didn't have enough firepower to kill the walker by himself.
Fry looked back nervously at Hermes. He held his gun out toward the danger zone and eyed his team leader questioningly in a silent request to engage the enemy.
Hermes hesitated for a few moments. Although it was their sworn duty to defend Earth's population from the nightwalker threat, they were instructed to fire on the creatures only when necessary due to how difficult they were to kill. But he didn't want to waste any opportunity to save a life.
Hermes gave Fry a nod and sat crouched against the wall with his pistol raised. Fry adopted the same position.
Trembling in fear, Fry quietly let air in and out of his nostrils and thought of his plan once more to calm down. He was going to wait for the walker to move to a safe distance, then begin shooting at it. Once he fired off his first shot, Hermes would come out of hiding and provide him with support fire. If they could each get at least eight rounds into the creature before it reached them, they'd be okay.
Fry forced the thought from his mind. As terrified as he was of engaging the walker, it was the only way he could save Munda from the horrible fate she was heading toward. He couldn't let her die, and it wasn't just because it might make Leela admire him if she knew he was responsible for saving her mother's life.
Fry listened to the walker's thudding footsteps as they started to fade into the distance and tensed his muscles. His heart hammering against his chest, he mentally counted down the seconds until he'd spring from cover.
Glancing down, he noticed a sizeable pool of blood at his feet. He could feel bile rising to his throat as he saw it trailing in the direction that Munda had been pulled. The dark red track extended several yards ahead of Fry and ran across a small wooden bridge that connected the two sewer blocks. His queasiness mounting, he saw her blood running up the front of a ramshackle building on the other side of the sewage.
The wet, gory trail ended just underneath a long pipe that extended up to the city's surface. There, he saw the last he'd ever see of Leela's mother as she ascended into the pipe — her tail swishing, her legs thrashing wildly as she futilely tried to fight off the creature that was about to end her life.
Even though he knew Munda was done for, Fry started to frantically make his way toward the pipe anyway, common sense taking a backseat to desperation.
Hermes raised a gloved hand over Fry's protective vest to prevent him from going any further. "Forget it, mon," he said glumly. "It's too late. We can't save her."
Fry's heart sank as he helplessly watched Munda disappear into the pipe. He hated to think how Leela would react if she knew he and Hermes had failed to save her mother, even if they did have almost no chance of succeeding against the nightwalker.
Hermes's voice interrupted Fry's gloomy thoughts. He tore his eyes away from the pipe and saw his leader run around a nearby corner ahead of him.
Fry took off after Hermes. Twenty seconds later, he saw Hermes stop in front of a very long iron ladder that hung from the sewer ceiling and ended just above their heads. The ladder led all the way up to a manhole cover situated next to the building they'd need to scale in order to rendezvous with the advance team.
Hermes stood underneath the ladder and jumped up, grabbing the lowest rung with both hands. Straining a bit to pull up his dangling heavyset body, he reached up and gripped the second lowest rung with his right hand and the third lowest with his left. It became much easier for him to climb when he got ahold of the lowest rung with one foot.
When Hermes was far enough above him, Fry jumped up and began to climb the ladder in the same manner that his leader had.
As he followed Hermes up to the surface, Fry felt his stomach clench up in knots. He knew he'd have to face dozens more of these creatures before the night was over. A titanic wave of dread washed over him as he realized the true extent of the danger that he and the rest of the human (and mutant) population were in because of the nightwalkers.
Since zazi has to attend meeting in seremban, I purposely follow him so that I could do full check up in my mother in law's clinic. I went there with arifah, she was kindly enough to spend her precious time with me *thanks angah*
at first, i have to register myself at the counter. it was a relief as the nurses were really helpful and friendly (maybe because my mom already told them that we will be there for check up, so please treat us right! hehe). after they took note on my height, weight and blood pressure, I have to do something that I hate the most, blood test!!! urrghhh I was so damn stressful! Then, urine test. we waited for the result for quite sometimes. later on, we got the result, the nurse explained to me every details. I also did breast check up (one way to prevent breast cancer). finally, I went to see the doctor. she checked the result and consult me on health during pregnancy. well, overall, my result was normal except for my weight, >45kg.
so I guess this is the "must do" for mom to be to do during their early pregnancy. we need someone to monitor our health, which is extremely important for the baby.
looks like these two have become a good friends of mine nowadays. it is pretty annoying and distressful but i'll live. anything for my loved ones. both of my mom and mother-in-law are really helpful, in terms of telling me what should I eat, do and so many more. zazi is also super duper supportive. he helps me to ease the pain *love u honey!!*
5th of September 2009.. i will never forget this date forever. it was the day that i found out that there is a tiny cute baby living inside of me.
i noticed that i missed my period last month. it was a good thing tho! last two weeks, my breast started to feel a bit sore, my appetite is unbelievably high and at times i am experiencing a pretty bad mood swing until now. pity zazi, my sayangness (^.^)
so yesterday evening, i decided to perform the pregnancy test as zazi was out to the gym. i didnt want him to see my disappointed face if the result is negative. turned out it was positive!!! i was jumping around like crazy woman! alhamdulillah, tersangat-sangat bersyukur kepada Allah kerana memberi aku peluang untuk menjadi seorang ibu. then, i waited for zazi to come home. i put the result on top of his laptop because i knew he will continue with work while i was cooking. once he looked at the result, he said, "b, ni ape maksudnye ni?". i was like buat bodoh, "maksud ape?" he stared at the result smiling. i never saw him smiling like that before. both of us were really happy and still couldn't believe the result in front of us.
after dinner, we went to the doctor, reconfirm the result. again, positive! we went back and told both of our parents. i asked my mom, "ibu happy tak?" and my mom said, "of coz la, ibu nak pegi bgtau ayah sambil melompat pasni!"
well, our new life has begun. from now on, i need to take a good care of myself. i really hope everything goes smoothly, insya Allah.....
It’s heartbreaking and exciting at the same time. Your baby is growing and developing at a rapid pace. It’s like you blinked and your mat leave was over. Are you returning to work soon? Here are a few tips for a smooth daycare transition.
Shop around and get on daycare lists early. If you live in a densely populated Canadian city, good daycare spots can be tough to come by. It’s not uncommon for parents to register their kids on top daycare wait lists before they give birth. We registered for three daycares when our daughter was a month old and only got into one by the time my mat leave had ended. Can you say stressful?
Be open to daycare locations close to home, en route to work, or near your office. Schedule a tour before committing to a waitlist so you can get a feel for the facility, daily routine and staff. Ensure the daycare has proper licensing, including all daycare staff. There are plenty of online resources and ratings available depending on where you live.
Attend playgroups to get your youngster used to the environment (and germs). When my daughter was about a month old, I started taking her to playgroups like story time classes at the local library and circle time at Ontario Early Years Centres. In the beginning, I felt like it benefitted my partially existent social life rather than her early development. By the time she was 10-11 months old, she would park herself in front of the facilitator to participate in activities instead of sitting with me. It made me feel like she would be more comfortable in a daycare environment. Some drop-in centres even offer daycare transition services, where they will care for your child for a couple hours.
Think of daycare as a chilly swimming pool. Most people like to dip their toe in to test the waters, then ease the rest of their bodies in. Once you get used to the feeling, you usually have a fun time. Daycare is new, unfamiliar and often frightening for babies. Ease them into the idea in a similar way. Most daycare facilities offer a transition program where you can take them for a visit on day one, leave them for an hour on day two, try out a half day on day three, then by day four they should be more comfortable with the idea.
Stock your medicine cabinet because your mini will get sick. Every parent I’ve talked to has the same experience. My daughter was sick with a cold or fever for a whole month after starting daycare. That lead to the whole family getting sick as well. Daycare staff will send your child home if they have a fever. Be proactive and check your boss’ temperature on working from home in case you have to stay home to care for a sick baby. Your sick days will run out.
There will be tears (I cried more than my daughter did). It will cost a lot at first (around the cost of rent in some cities). Eventually, most kids love it and they will learn a ton which will prepare them well for school. Good luck!
Hi, I'm Erica. After my children left home and I went through a divorce at the same time, embracing the new phase in my life was essential. I hope to share some of the inspiration I found with you if you are also in the process of letting go and moving on. Here's to living an abundant life no matter what phase we are in! Read more here

No problem. If it's easier for you, you can aswell write in English, I suppose everyone around here is able to answer in English. So, what are you planing?
Hey there, a couple of doubts that other user may like to share answers to. I am imaging a 750Gb WD disk, with one very weak head. I used the option to only image discoverable partitions, to save time. (This is a great feature and has worked perfectly in the past). But this was a little weird, it DID find a partition, spanning about 90Gb in one continuous block at the start of the data. I have normally seen them all over the disk.
I am about 3 days into the imaging session, and the client tells me the disk in reality had one one partition, spanning the entire 750Gb! There was also no recent format, or re-install.
- how can I open up the sectors to scan to take in to account the whole disk, without re-staring and loosing the last 3 days of imaging?
AISI, Atola did not make a mistake. The partitioning information is correct, if you assume a sector size of 4096 bytes.
Not sure what you mean by that, but if you are referring to the spaces in the numbers, then that's how Google's calculator returns its results.
BTW, I suspect that the OP's drive may have been inside an enclosure that was configured with 4KB LBAs.
Hi Franc, after the 63 x there is a "cool" smiley.. you may not have emoticons turned on and not see what I do..
I think Frank is correct about the 4K USB bridge. Can you provide the contents of sector 504 to confirm that it is an NTFS boot sector?
It would appear that Atola isn't able to handle this, yet. You will need to get a full clone of the drive and then connect the clone to the bridge or use R-Studio to interpret the 4k sectors. DDI with DRE or R-Studio over the network can target the data to be cloned.
I ran into a case recently where DDI was having an issue with an odd sector size, Yarek connected remotely to confirm that it wasn't just me and he supplied me with a fix the next day. Perhaps you can get a quick fix from Atola, as well.
Assuming you are running v3.x software, you could simply create a new imaging session with all parameters set to defaults. It will copy only those sectors that weren't copied with any previous session(s).
If you are running an older release (v2.x), then you could stop the imaging process, and then change the parameters of the existing session to image all sectors (then hit Resume). Once again, Insight will never re-image what has already been imaged, unless you explicitly delete all imaging history.
This was standard laptop drive, no external enclosure, windows 7 pro. Looking at build date I would say the machine was on its original install. Doubt 4K sectors are factor.
I agree that I should simply run the whole disk, but this has me wondering. Poking around past the last sector with data as informed by atola, I don't see much worth imaging........ BTW disk as a WD7500BPVT
Windows 7 defaults to sector 2048 as the boot sector of the first partition. Sector 63 is the default for Windows XP and earlier. Moreover, Windows 7 would have created an NTFS partition (type 07), whereas Atola is reporting "System ID: 6". I'm assuming "system ID" is Atola-speak for "partition ID", in which case type 06 would be a FAT partition.
According to WD's specs, the WD7500BPVT has 1,465,149,168 user sectors per drive. Assuming this drive were installed in a 4KB sectored enclosure, it would then report 183,143,646 LBAs.
If you could show us the MBR code and boot sector code, then that will tell us which OS was responsible for each sector.
As for the "NTFS boot sector at: 63", that appears to be a FAT boot sector. The sector count of 61448562 corresponds to about 31GB at 512 bytes per sector. That's about what you would expect if you tried to create a FAT32 partition in Windows XP and later.
Sector 2048 does appear to be a standard NTFS boot sector, but its size amounts to about 104MB (= 204799 x 512). That's the size of the reserved partition in a Windows 7 system. There must be a second NTFS boot sector at about the 104MB mark. You should also be able to locate its backup by reverse searching the drive.
Dmitry, in 2.2.x the only way I can change the imaging range is by starting a new imaging session. I would guess this ignores the copied block list from the previous session?
It sounds like a dating technique, but it's actually a free tool that locates and works with partitions in readonly mode, much as one would in Windows Explorer.
mediaman, I don't have that version on hand, but I can help you via Teamviewer. PM me your Teamviewer details and I will have a look.
I and my cousin are signed up with the same email address (abigail.sophie.granger@gmail.com), but we are two different people and my cousin is 12 and she wanted so much to sign up to HOL, so I used my email.
My boyfriend signed up a couple of hours ago from my computer, so we might share the same IP address.
Could you please delete Diana Ravenclaw's account? I was just playing around lol I won't get punishment, will I?
My brother just signed up for HOL, and when we're both at home, we both use the same internet, although I doubt that would become a problem unless he came on IRC and the internet location showed up as the same, which I don't think he will (he's a bookworm).
His name is Alexander Bowne, al1457, and we use different computers, e-mails, and passwords for our HOL activities. I just wanted to give the HO a heads up.
This is the first time I have ever spotted something this weird with a student signing up for my Potions For Beginners class.
She sent in her homework but used a name Allana Anail which came up as someone who was here years ago - al1493 Allana Anail Gryffindor First Year
Would you please check this out before I go through the trouble of correcting her homework only to find out something is not right.

My two siblings also use HOL, we are all on the same IP until I move out in a few days. We just wanted to make sure we weren't deleted.
My younger brothers are plannning on joining HOL next term. One is planning on being named Ryan Raspberry. The other wants to be something ending in Jones.
I got a friend to sign up to HOL, with the name Harun Phantom, ID is ha1150. He used my laptop to sign up, and had to use my last name 'cause it wouldn't let him use his own one, but it's definitely not a double sign up.
Hi! I joined HOL in its very first year (like... 2001?) and quit after a year and a half. Since the website moved to a new server in those years, I thought my old account didn't exist anymore, but I tried to join using my old name and it says it's not available. And I can't log in with my old ID and password. Also the e-mail I used back then is not active anymore.
Would it be possible to get back my old account? (if so, feel free to delete my current account ei828)

You should now be able to create a new password here based on your old HOL ID. I have also set the e-mail address associated with your old forum account to your new address, so you can use the reset password functionality on the forum to get a new password.
Welcome to May! May Day and all kinds of celebrations, from the flowering of favorite shrubs (Northern Hemisphere) to the closing down of gardens (Southern Hemisphere) happen all around the world.
For any who are interested, HOL House Cup standings at the moment show Gryffindor has 17,484 points, Hufflepuff has 28,795 points, Ravenclaw has 32,480 points and Slytherin has 29,354 points. Since we're in the middle of the Term and there is so much happening, and those House points and standings can easily change, I didn't bold or colour them!
Starting with HOLLERS, we will be having our regular Monthly Challenges! I get to post an Evil Jigsaw after posting this Newsletter, Kim is going to give us a great Crossword Puzzle and the new resident HOLLERS slave assistant, Maxim, is continuing on with his innovative Creative Outlet opportunities to earn bunches of HOOTS. He has Star Wars Day, Internet Day and National Limerick Day already posted. Remember, too, that you are welcome to participate in the Inspirational Categories and even get Awards for doing stuff!
Sky and Kim say they don't have anything planned as such. Mostly there is a huge celebration that Gryffindor has finally ousted all the doxies, nifflers and boggarts from the Common Room so it's safe to come play with the Lions again. There also appeared to be an influx of fine feathered flamingos so watch out for pink feathers when you go visit?
Maxim says the Spiffies will be playing back to back games in the middle of May! On Saturday, HQT plays GQT and on Sunday, HQT plays SQT. Also, come visit the Games Tent (aka Department of Huffle Games and Sports) where someone will probably be having a Challenge or three where you can earn some lovely, shiny Diamonds.
Arianna reports there are a bunch of games in their Silly Snakes Forum and they welcome more folks to come play! Also, remember that submissions for the next issue of Serpentimes will be accepted. Get your name in print and earn House points!
Close to the end of May, Slytherin will be running another Emerald Cup. Remember last year that the theme was Wizard of Oz/Wicked/The Whiz? This year the theme is FRANCE! So be ready to have fun with Beauxbatons, Beauty and the Beast, Les Miz and more.
Polaris says that Ravenclaw’s fun Icebreakers activity, run by Arielle and Polaris, and open to all Houses during April, is winding down with results to be announced shortly. In May, a travel themed game called Where in the World is scheduled for Eagles only.
Quidditch activities in May include the Quidditch Pickups. What is that? Go here and find out! Remember that there are a couple of Quidditch games scheduled for the middle of May - check here for the dates!
Amy writes that The Book Club has an exciting month ahead. May is HOL Writing Month. Sharpen those quills and get writing. We encourage writers of all ability to participate. We'll also be continuing with our monthly book discussions -- The Princess Bride is up next!

The bores vary in size during machining at the factory (from any manufacturer) in this case from class A 84.00mm bore (Class A smallest piston) in 0.01mm steps per grade up to Class E 84.05mm bore (Class E biggest piston) and they used (still do to this day) differing size pistons to match the piston skirt - bore fit, which in this case is 0.05mm - 2 thou" or 0.002". On the skirt of the crankcase where the sump bolts on the bore size classes will be letter stamped, A thru E.
OE factory TC supplied pistons for all 84mm bore models were size classed to suit these bores according to the 'across-skirt' measurement at the gauge height (see below):
No3 83.965mm - Not right even for the original Class B bore - should be 83.94 -83.95mm. Too big, Fiat don't make mistakes, most likely been swapped from another engine by the seller.
If you want a proper evaluation of 'fit for duty' you cannot guess the history of a used block, you have the right measuring equipment. Otherwise you run the risk of high ring gaps and loose skirt-bore which can crack the skirts. There is no significant wear-ridge at the tops of the bores so some wise-guy in the 'trade', I know who it is, has been up and down the bores with a hone and 'passed it off' as a rebuild, which is the kind of cheating thing I see often.
The piston ring end gaps were so big I did not bother measuring, see below, nearly 1.5mm, should be about 0.45mm. This is a combination of very badly worn rings (see photos) and bores too big. NOT FIT FOR DUTY! If you like to run engines like this never phone me!
The rings are worn both radially and vertically - huge ridge in upper face where the ring bangs against the top land at tdc, not easy to see in the photo because it is so highly polished, usually typical of very high mileage/poorly maintained oil. But - add in the scoring and scuffing and impact damage around the top land and on the skirts in a vertical pattern and the razor sharp ring edge condition and we have all the sure signs of bore washing from over-fuelling from, yes you guessed it - ECU fuelling chipped and generally messed with.
So we have a block with massively oversized bores, pistons not matched for size, rings worn out all over and way over size on end gap and the whole thing basically a pile of junk.
(To add insult to injury, the crank had been badly reground and was already tearing the new bearing to bits, a replacement rod had been fitted where it had run a bearing, there was no attempt to match rod weights, one balance shaft and the oil pump were seized, the crank had not even been unplugged and cleaned. Madness. And that's just the BLOCK!)
Measuring the piston skirt at the gauge-height distance, about 1/2&quot; -1&quot; skirt tip, you have to swing the micrometer to find the true width, piston skirts are elliptical (top view) and barrel shaped (side view).
Bore gauge is calibrated against a micrometer and set at a nominal, say, 85mm size. With the gauge in the bore, smallest reading is true diameter, hence the +/- arrows on the dial to tell me the deviance over/under set size.
Piston in bore where it would see max cylinder pressure, about 16 deg ATDC, huge ring end gap. I build to 14-16 thou&quot;...This engine would be a 'pumper' with no power at all. If the gaps are too big the rings won't 'choke' and seal, ever.
New engine and well maintained one you're going to get 1.5 - 2 thou&quot; side clearance, we have 6 here and it's NOT the worst. The ring and groove are battered to bits.
The Archipelago Sea as a boating destination has been in our list for long. Finally there was a good chance to have a trip there. We launched from Paraisten portti slipway and headed south, towards The Archipelago Sea National Park, where the forecast predicted 7 knot breeze which would build up by the evening.
As we were about to get out of the shadow of Sorpo island the wind started intensify. I have to say I had butterflies in my stomach because it wasn’t evident what was waiting for us on the open water ahead. However, the journey started in comfortable 7 knot wind which was so smooth compared to all the choppiness of the lakeland.
We sailed past Högland, Rundharun and some lesser rocky islands on our journey to Sandön island. Its name is Swedish and means The Sand Island. Speed over ground was between 4.5 and 5.5 knots most of the time and it took us less than two hours to make 7.4 nautical miles. Landing to Sandön was easy.
We had picnic, explored the island and chatted with other boaters. Even if the water was warm none of us was interested in swimming in the salty water.
Sandön was an impressive destination for all of us. A sandy island in the Archipelago Sea is a rare finding. At its northeastern top there is a very long sandbank which was completely visible in this summer. It extended around three hundred meters from the island.
Even if there are sand and pine forest on the island its appearance differs from the similar scenery of South Carelian area where we live. In our eyes the vegetation had slight exotic look that made it special.
We began our journey back around four O’clock in the afternoon because there was a warning to the Archipelago Sea about modrate gale. Naturally we didn’t want to try sailing in such conditions. We ran smoothly in breeze which was bit stronger than in the morning, around 13 knots. I have to say that for someone, who sails in lakes mostly, the unobscured horizon looks very nice, and for sure there were many occasions to admire it. Also, compared to Lake Saimaa we saw far more sailboats and most of them had sails raised. That’s how it should be!
When we arrived at Paraisen portti strait the pier next to the slipway was full of motor boats. Also, because we were quite cautious about trying to recover the boat using the slipway which wasn’t even sheltered anymore we decided to paddle around the pier and to try to recovere the boat on the small sandy patch there. Some planning and effort was needed but finally the boat was on the trailer and we were able to start driving back.

FearOne LLC offers its 2017 Hyundai Tucson SEMA build for H.M.A.-the third stright year the builder was awarded such a project. See it featured in the Covercraft booth #23531Center hall at 2016 SEMA Show.
The Shop Magazine getting their sights set on FEARONE's tantalizingly slick 2016 Chevrolet Colorado voted one of the Top Ten Trucks 2015 SEMA show and 2016 Hyundai Tucson masterpiece, it was no wonder that they dedicated two full pages in its honor. They extole its virtues beginning with its eye-popping show presence to its inner sound system engineering. FearOne is humble, honored and blessed by all our sponsors support.
The meaning behind our SEMA project, 2015 Ultimate Genesis Coupe 3.8 is close to my heart. The main reason for this build is cancer awareness. I lost my dad and brother due to cancer. Fearone LLC collaborated with Hyundai Motor America, American Cancer Society and SimonMed Imaging in hopes that the car would have a big impact on cancer awareness.
Both in business and in life, there are certain people who seem to have been placed on this Earth for a singular, nearly predestined purpose. From an early age, these individuals exhibit a relentless aptitude and interest in their field, and their talent outshines most anything around them. For Ariz.-based Fearone LLC, an up-and-coming SEMA project vehicle builder, this singular talent was apparent by about the 4th grade.
2008 turned out to be a banner year for FEARONE. With so much attention being riveted upon their PT Cruiser, HHR and Solstice, it wasn't long before video and TV offers began rolling in for their custom show cars. It was DOMESTIC DRIVER MAGAZINE that stepped up and furthered the media blitz by doing a seven page spread on their three gems.
The FEARONE HHR was not just a show stopper in the states. TUNING MAGAZINE, a hot rod feature publication, out of Budapest, Hungary, simply couldn't help their delirious fascination when they spotted the FEARONE HHR show car. They dedicated their magazine cover and seven front pages to the HHR's incredible show styling.
Let's say that in spite of the intoxicating ladies gracing almost every other page, FEARONE's HHR was simply a must read. Yeah...right.
With world renowned PERFORMANCE AUTO & SOUND MAGAZINE getting their sights set on FEARONE's tantalizingly slick HHR masterpiece, it was no wonder that they dedicated three full pages in its honor. They extole its virtues beginning with its eye-popping show presence to its inner sound system engineering.
Far too often, show cars are dismissed as company display vehicles—D-boy’s stunters or rich men’s play toys. Contrary to these beliefs, show-stopping rides are being built by hard-working, genuine car buffs. South Los Angeles resident automotive repair shop manager Chito Pacheco and designer Fearone LLC AZ. are the personification of a true custom car trailblazer, and their marvelous ‘Maro is a testament to that.
Prescott AZ. Eye-catching cars that appear in a movie, television shows and music videos originated on the home computer screen of Fearone LLC. A former rock 'n' roll drummer who move to AZ. in 2005 renders customized, or after market designs for cars i.e. GM, Ford, Dodge, Fiat and Honda on his computer screen.
They found the vehicle an absolute show stopper and placed the FEARONE PT Cruiser on the cover and on a record number of 9 pages! Geez guys, so much for fair journalism.
FEARONE's first custom effort was the PT Cruiser, which FEARONE christened as its first show car entry into the custom vehicle show circuit back in the mid 2000's, caught the undivided attention of CRUISER QUARTERLY MAGAZINE.
Like to thank Dean again at Dean Designs for the super job on the posters we did to pass out to our sponsors in the Quad-City area of N. AZ. and of course all the work Dean Designs has done for Fearone LLC since basically day one. Also a huge thanks to Blindside Photography for the excellent pictures that made poster possible. On another note, Fearone already working on a possible SEMA project build for Tim's Auto Group Prescott AZ. Nothing definite to date on either a Toyota Tundra or a Scion FRS, were proposing on. Dealing with a dealership is allot more different then dealing with the OEM manufacture, but flattering to have the interest from Tim's on a Fearone SEMA build.

Three separate buildings make up this family home and deer farm in Northamptonshire. The main house building is predominantly framed in Cross-Laminated-Timber (CLT) floor, wall and roof panels with Glulam portal frames forming the pitched roof. The timber beam and column connections have been extensively detailed to ensure the desired aesthetic can be achieved, prior to being taken on by a specialist timber contractor. A separate guest wing and stables will be constructed in more traditional blockwork and timber, while the working barn building will be framed in lightweight steel portal frames.
A fishing lake is also being created on the site at the junction of three existing streams. The below ground drainage will be fed through a packaged sewage processing plant before being discharged into the watercourse.
Dan Evans helps students understand the importance of loving and respecting themselves in order to break free from self-defeating behaviors like smoking, drinking and drugs. He also makes it clear that behaviors like drama, victimhood, anger and most importantly self-bullying all stem from a lack of self-worth.
Dan grew up captivated by a love of music and a dream of sharing it with any available audience. He spent his teenage years honing his skills on the guitar and piano, and later, welcomed the challenge of writing and performing his own songs. But even as his popularity increased with young audiences in the Chicago area, a single shadow loomed over his aspirations — his constant battle with obesity and self-esteem.
At age 21, his lifelong battle with the scale and his own insecurities came to a screeching halt in 2008 when Dan and his mother, Jackie, were chosen to become contestants on season five of NBC’s hit reality television show, The Biggest Loser. Dan Evans quickly became a household name amongst the show’s 18 million viewers. He lost 136 pounds and, subsequently, found the doors to his childhood dreams flung wide open.
He shares this story along with his inspiring songs in our interactive assembly presentation. His song LETTER TO MY ADDICTION is a powerful anthem to the joys of overcoming obstacles. The title song from his GOIN’ ALL OUT CD tells the story of never giving up on your dream no matter who is telling you that you’ll never make it.
“Hey U.G.L.Y. Presenter Dan Evans was engaging to all ages of our student elementary school population. Marrying his current music with powerfully inspiring lyrics, along with personal testimony, his words spoke directly to our students and the experiences they too are facing. His energy created an environment of self reflection for the bullied as well as the bully, while feathering the delivery with genuine affection and understanding. Our students were able to leave the presentation with real life tools to assist them in combating bullying.” Melissa Kuczmanski / School Guidance Counselor
“I learned to not self-bully and to not let people bully me. I liked the music and guitar.” 4th Grade Student
“Dan helped me ‘ squish out’ my self-bullying. When a negative thought comes into my mind I just think of Dan and his presentation, then I push out the negative thought and put in a positive thought.” 5th Grade Student
“He helped me realize that sometimes when my friends call me a bully they’re telling the truth. I realize now that I have got to stop bullying. I am trying to change me.” 5th Grade Student
“This program made me more self-confident and made me watch my temper when people make me mad.” 5th Grade Student

In this course, you'll learn how to make the data work for you so that you can aggregate, analyze and visualize your data.
The course is aimed to be as complete as possible. It will include a lot of practice so that nothing stays theoretical, and the quality is in full HD, so that you can see everything on-screen.
“Don’t aim at success-the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue….as the unintended side-effect of one’s personal dedication to a course greater than ones”.
Thus was born the Fertility Research Center…as a side effect of Dr.Kamala’s unstinted, dedicated hard work. Her basic need to fulfill the dreams of the unfulfilled, coupled with a thirst to acquire the latest knowledge in her chosen field, enabled her to start the ART Laboratory at G.G.Hospital in 1986. An account of her memoirs has been published which serves as an invaluable guide providing encouragement to beginners in the field of ART.
The initial struggle involved a number of overseas visits to other pioneering institutes, observation of their standards of work, quality control, results and last but not the least the two most important determinants of outcome-culture medium and maintenance and running of equipment. As commercial media was not freely available at the time and proved to be very expensive to procure, Dr. Kamala had to learn the technique of preparation from Monash University, Melbourne. It also required a whole array of life sustaining salts and the Milli-Q water purification systems in order to be able to prepare it back home. Now the lab still prepares culture medium besides using commercial media for specialized procedures like ICSI /IMSI, PICSI, blastocyst cultures and PGS / PGD. When first started, the Laboratory was equipped to do only Intra uterine inseminations and thereafter progressed to incorporate the latest techniques in advanced infertility management. The staffs are constantly updated on newer techniques and follow a rigid protocol in Laboratory maintenance as well as storage of records. A separate theatre complex is housed within the Lab for performing ovum pick-ups as well as for performing ART related surgical procedures. Documentation of all procedures with printout of the treatment following transferred embryos and blastocysts are given to the couples.
Our areas of interest include oocyte and ovarian tissue cryopreservation, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) endometrial regarding studies, cytoplasmic transfer, mitochondrial studies and more.
At our center we perform the following procedures to help us arrive at a conclusive diagnosis to ensure the best possible chances for conception
The hospital is also attached to an Advanced Ultrasound Imaging center and Genetic Lab for their referral services and genetic workup.

For 26 weeks I will take you on a family history journey through the alphabet, one letter at a time. I have decided that each post will be educational in nature, focusing on topics related to resources, methodology, tools, etc. Although the challenge is complete, there are still some people who are finishing up and Alona, the host, is encouraging others to participate anyway. Additional information on the challenge, can be found at Take the ‘Family History Through the Alphabet’ Challenge.
Timelines are such a wonderful tool in genealogy research. You can learn so much by looking at a visual depiction of your ancestors over time. From research gaps to research analysis, timelines should always to a go-to method for working through tough research problems.
I’ve written about timelines before in the following two posts from 2010, which I encourage you to check out:
Most genealogy software has some sort of timeline feature. In addition, you can create your own using charting software (such as Edraw and Visio), desktop publishing software, or by using the drawing tools in Word (some people even use Excel). Sometimes, I just take pencil and paper and sketch out a timeline.
There are also a few websites out there that let you create and share timelines, including OurTimeLines and TimeRime. I actually used TimeRime to generate a timeline for my second great-grandmother (see my post Fearless Females – Timeline).
Whenever you find yourself stuck on a research problem, try using a timeline. Whatever method you choose, be it software or by hand, it may be just the thing to help you bust down that wall!

Adults can reach body lengths of 3-5 mm. Their elongated, domed, dark bodies have a strong metallic sheen, which is bronze, copper, blue, dark green and (more rarely) black in colour. The metallic blue-green to blue or black forewings (elytra ) have clearly visible dots, which run in multiple rows lengthwise. The head, scutellum and legs are a similar colour to the body but diffusely spotted have a scattering of dots. At the rear end of the body is a defensive gland, whose secretions determ both macrophages and enemies as also have disinfecting effects.
The brassy willow beetle is active from May to September. It mainly feeds on the leaves of poplars and willow trees. The females lay their eggs on the food plants of the larvae, which are the same as those of the adult beetles.
In the late larval stage, their bodies appear elongated and tapered in shape. They are beige in colour and darker than previously. Their heads are shiny dark brown and black and their back plates, reddish brown or dark brown in colour.
Each segment of the abdomen has dark brown bumps and dark brown bristles at the edges and in the middle. Their glands are dark brown and without hair. Their legs (3 pairs) are glossy dark brown to black. A few weeks after hatching, the larvae pupate on their food plants. One to two weeks later, the new generation of beetles hatch. Brassy willow beetles overwinter in the soil as adults.
Investigation of environmental conditions and pollution of soil, surficial deposits, groundwater and surface water in three areas in India
This is a geo-environmental project focusing on water and soil quality of the Behedi basin, Kalwan Taluka, Nashik district and two other tribal areas in India. Anthropogenic activities, use of pesticides, lack of sewerage facilities, cattle breeding practices, and lack of education on clean environment are quite similar in India and Nicaragua. These were the main focus areas of the research conducted in Nicaragua by Dr. Ulpu V�is�nen and other researchers of the Geological survey of Finland (GTK). Hence, we plan to replicate the study in India concentrating mainly on the areas which are farming areas with cattle breeding and possibly some mining areas, exploiting the experience of the Finnish experts in Nicaragua.
Financial support: The pilot study in part is supported by contribution from INSEED, Jaydeep Nikam, YCMOU, Nashik and Ulpu V�is�nen, Geological Survey of Finland, Finland. An external funding is being sought for field work and laboratory analysis.
Aims: The main aim of the study is to assess the contamination of surface and groundwater by pesticides and toxic elements. The study also aims to educate the local community about hygiene and sanitation, and to build eco-friendly toilets.
Pilot study: To follow-up the area of the study conducted during 1992-1995 in the Behedi basin and to extend the 1992-1995 study to analyse the residue of pesticides in groundwater as well as in soil samples.
Expansion of the study to include analysis of pesticides and other biochemical analysis of the samples from the study sites and two other study areas.
Status and outcome: Sample collection was completed in January 2008, and the analysis reports are awaited.

Walking can fuel creative thought. It can provide bonding time with your spouse, child or friend. It can introduce exercise into your life at no cost. It can help you wind down for a better night's sleep. It can be a much needed relief from stress.
Today is National Walking Day, and many cities are participating. The American Heart Association introduced the annual event about 10 years ago because it felt people spend too much time sitting in front of screens at work and home.
Walking briskly for 30 minutes a day can offset inactivity and reduce the risk of heart disease. And, here is some really good news: The New York Times points out that research show walkers are most likely burning more calories than they think.
It doesn't matter if you're walking outside or on a treadmill, a study by the American Psychological Association found walking improves the generation of novel ideas. The brain boost from walking even extends to when people sit down to do their creative work shortly after they finish walking. So, during the workday, if you hit a creative block or simple can't figure out how to resolve a problem you're facing, take a walk out to your car and around the building. The answer just may come to you.
Even the most time-pressed among us can squeeze a short walk into his or her day. Walk around the block before you head to work or get out and walk through your lunch break. At your next business meeting,instead of sitting in a stuffy meeting room, suggest walking around the office instead. Chances are it will probably be a more productive meeting.
A few nights a week, my husband and I take a walk around the neighborhood with our dog. We leave our phones at home. It's become our alone time to plan our weekends, discuss our daily challenges and share our life goals. I really think it's been a big boost to our marriage.
Lots of my friends love their fitbits or other activity trackers. But I am resisting getting caught up in counting my steps or making walking a chore. To me, it's all about decompressing or bonding.
So, I'm suggesting you walk your way to a better work life balance. It's possible and today is a great day to start!

Definitely the matter of the imamate is from the religion and that religion is not perfected without it. The Prophet (S), before leaving to the better world, has declared to his umma the principles of their religion and has showed them the straight path and the clear truth. He has appointed to them Ali as the imam. He has not left anything that the umma need unless he has declared it to them. Then whoever claims that Allah has not perfected His religion denies the Book of Allah and so he becomes unbeliever. Do they know the importance of the imamate and its position to the umma so that they determine as they like? The imamate is much more important, greater in position, higher in rank, more impervious and profounder than to be perceived by their own minds or to be refuted by their own opinions or that they themselves appoint the imam according to their fancies.

Long-time readers of FMDY may be looking at this post title and wonder (perhaps even aloud), “Hey, haven’t you used that title before? Are you so unimaginative that you’re just recycling material now?” To which I would respond, “It’s entirely likely that I have given that it’s from a song by my favorite musical artist. Also, I believe in recycling. It’s good for the environment. Do you hate the environment?” Let’s move on, shall we?

KMQuake2 is a great source port for Quake 2 game. Originally it has been started to extend the engine limits for in-game map sizes, entities count, sounds, drawing distance and so on.
Later, improved particle system, clipped decals, stencil shadows and lightning effects have been added, making this port one of the most visually advanced ports produced for the Quake 2.
All these features actually mean, that there are really cool effects, such as water splashes, smoke trails, reailistic blood decals, bloom and waves on the water added into original game process.
Download and unpack the "kmquake2_019.zip" archive to the directory with Quake 2 game files (this was 'E:\games\Quake II' in my case)
Ensure that 'model shading' is set to 'high' and select 'Dynamic planar' setting for 'entity shadows'. You can also try the 'projective' settings, which is more realistic but can give some shadow rendering issues.
I think this is the best engine for Quake 2 there is. Not only does it supports all advanced features you may find in other Q2 ports, but it also extends the limits of Quake 2 to its maximum. Try Single Player maps with hundreds of monsters fighting each other to compare Knightmare engine with (for instance) Quake 2 Evolved. You'll see what I mean. For all future Single Player projects I would advise using Knightmare.

Some of Munich's museums are among the most famous ones in the world. They can easily compete with world-class museums like the Louvre, British Museum, MET, ...
On a rainy day during your stay in Munich (and it can rain in any month of the year!), a museum visit is one of the best things you can do.
It's a fantastic experience, even for small kids. My father, a retired physics and mathematics teacher, has visited the Deutsches Museum at least 20 times with school classes or on his own and still thinks it's a great place to go.
My Spanish friend who studied history of art, used to come here at least once a year just to visit the Glyptothek. Now she lives in Munich and visits the museum at least once a month!
I like the Glyptothek, but honestly, I don't understand, how someone can spend more than an hour observing and studying one single statue :-) You'll frequently see art students sketching pictures of the statues.
Off course, if you like art and paintings, there's more than enough choice for you. Visit either one or all three of the Pinakotheken:
The Alte Pinakothek (alt = old) shows masterpieces of European paintings from the 14th to 18th century, whereas the Neue Pinakothek (neu = new) features paintings from the 19th century.

The imamate is a divine position that Allah has favored Abraham (as) with after prophethood then He has honored him with companionship thirdly. Allah has said,
So this verse has annulled every imamate of every unjust one until the Day of Resurrection and it limited the imamate to the choice that Allah has chosen.
The choice is the progeny of Abraham (as) that Allah has honored and preferred to all of the human beings. Allah has said,
and We made them Imams who guided (people) by Our command, and We revealed to them the doing of good and the keeping up of prayer and the giving of the alms, and Us (alone) did they serve.”11
It has been still in Abraham’s progeny inherited by one after the other and age after age until it has been inherited by Prophet Muhammad (as). Allah has said,
“Most surely the nearest of people to Ibrahim are those who followed him and this Prophet and those who believe and Allah is the guardian of the believers.”12
