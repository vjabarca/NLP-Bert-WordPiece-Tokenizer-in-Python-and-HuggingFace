The DVV is an Institute of the German Adult Education Association. This was set up in 1953 as an umbrella organization for the Land (provincial) associations of Volkshochschulen (adult education centres) in the Federal Republic of Germany, there now being 16 such associations. The historical roots of the Volkshochschulen (VHS) go back to the beginnings of the workers' movement and to the popular education of the late 19th century. Today, the VHS are public continuing education canters offering a wide range of provision, from vocational skills and further training, and a second chance to acquire school-leaving and other qualifications, to courses with political and cultural themes, and leisure courses. The DVV represents the organizational and educational interests of the VHS and their Land associations. It is a partner in or member of the following bodies:
Center of Contemporary Art –Tbilisi is a partner organization of DVV International from 2012. From this period DVV International is a general sponsor of CCA-Tbilisi.

Stopping shootings and killings is a beginning place. Our goal is to eliminate shootings and killings, make the Save Our Streets program unnecessary in its current form, and ultimately create neighborhoods that go beyond surviving to truly thriving. While we are touched when young people tell us they want to be Violence Interrupters when they grow up, we want them to imagine a future without gun violence. It is our duty and responsibility to our participants to hold onto this vision no matter what. We will not shrink our dreams or expectations.
Every day and every month, we work to achieve what was once impossible. Young people who have been failed by every system and kicked out of program after program find a home with S.O.S.

We strive to make sure that the voices, experiences, and ideas of people who have been failed by systems are amplified and acted upon. We know that our neighborhoods are more than what they are often painted to be; they are, in fact, filled with powerful leaders, with even more in the making.

Three themes - Everyday life in Ancient Hawai`i, the Hawaiian Kingdom and Contemporary Hawai'i-- are prevalent in the Kumu Cultural Center (Kumu is Hawaiian for source of learning). In addition, the center will have three separate meeting rooms - the Princess Bernice Pauahi Bishop Room, the Princess Ke`elikolani Room and the Queen Emma Naea Room - and a business center.
The Pride of Aloha design team worked closely with Mary Philpotts, a well-respected designer from Hawai`i whose vision was instrumental in the recent remodeling of the ship, to create the center. Philpotts enlisted the efforts of a team of local historians, photographers, artisans and resource people to present this multi-faceted view of life in Hawai'i. More than 40 Hawaiian artists and artisans provided the art, crafts, carvings, quilts, memorabilia and reproductions of artifacts that the center displays.
"The Kumu Cultural Center represents a major undertaking by Mary and her colleagues who have created a truly unique place of history and culture," said Colin Veitch, president and CEO of NCL America. "A place that we hope not only our guests will enjoy but that will be meaningful to the Hawai`i community as well."
According to Philpotts, many of the pieces displayed are associated with individuals, many of whom are Native Hawaiian, who have a willingness to share Hawaiian cultural knowledge and history with Pride of Aloha passengers.
"We want to bring a viable experience to Hawai`i's visitors by utilizing and embracing the artistry and legacy of the Hawaiian people," Philpotts said. "Our artists and artisans have used their expertise to make this center a source of knowledge, a tool for an exchange of learning.
In The 'Everyday Life in Ancient Hawai`i' area, guests will learn about the first Polynesians who settled Hawai'i 1,500 years before Captain Cook came to the Islands. A reproduction of daily life includes kapa beaters, poi pounders, games, food vessels, fishing hooks and hula implements. Extraordinary canoe models, as well as historic photographs and informative text, describe the experience of ka po'e kahiko, the people of old.
In the Hawaiian Kingdom segment, guests will learn about the Islands' rich history through text and images of the reigning Hawaiian monarchs, or ali'i. Also included, are reproductions of hand kahili--a feather decorated staff that acknowledged the presence of royalty, and a lei niho palaua- hair necklace worn only by ali'i giving them authority to speak for their people. Four ki'i-wooden carvings representing the four principal Hawaiian gods, are also on display.
The 30s and 40s, the time period that created the worldview of an exotic and romantic Hawai'i, is represented in Contemporary Hawai`i. This area describes the Waikiki culture and the steamship era when visitors came by sea from the mainland.
Waikiki, previously the playground for royalty, became everyone's home, including visitors who would sometimes spend a month with the "locals." Display cases showcase the romance of the period with original "hapa-haole" sheet music (a mixing of musical cultures with Hawaiian music and English words); etched glass; jewelry; hula dolls; post cards; and photographs.
"With the Kumu Cultural Center we took a fresh, real approach," Philpotts said. "We produced exhibits that represent the history and culture of Hawai`i, and involved Hawaiians and local people in the telling of their story. The Hawaiian culture is alive and well today-we have so much to learn from each other, this center helps make this kind of exchange possible."
NCL America's Pride of Aloha is the first modern U.S.-flag cruise ship in almost 50 years.

Okay, so my life has been in a total chaotic mess for about two week now …and that started as soon as my son got home from university. He hasn’t been here long but wow, did he ever pick up some bad habits while he was away. Um, I’ve been teaching you to put the toilet seat down since you were old enough to use it, and what’s with all the dishes on the counter every morning. I haven’t been too hard on him though, since he’s leaving for Vietnam on Friday. Yes, he’s going to Vietnam! Half way around the world from where we are! I’m still having a hard time wrapping my brain around that one.
He accepted a three month internship at the Canadian Consulate in Vietnam, and while he’s beyond excited, I have eight new ulcers. So in the two weeks he’s been home, work has pretty much gone to the way side for me. I’ve been helping him arrange needles, doctor’s appointments, dentist appointments, travel Visa, bank visa, housing in Vietnam, plane tickets (30 hour flight, kill me now!) etc…
I really am enjoy these few short weeks we have together, but I have to tell you, I’m missing Pride, Stone and Logan. I feel like those three are my kids too and I’m so anxious to get back to telling their story.
So in the meantime, before I rush my son off to his next appointment, I’m going to leave you with this excerpt from book three! Unedited, of course!
At the mention of Logan’s name, Stone’s eyes darken to a deadly shade of black and his nostrils flare. He rakes his hair from his face, only for it to fall forward again.
His jaw tightens and I brace myself because I know what’s coming next. “You don’t have to go back you know,” he says.
I look away from him, anger erupting inside me. “Yes, I do.” I say the words out loud as I cut the mental connection between us.
“Haven’t we lost enough, already?” I ask, trying to keep my voice from rising to the point of hysteria as the others begin to stir around us. “Our childhood, our parents, our freedom?”
I glance back at him in time to see silver shards bleed into his black pupils. “We could end up losing more,” he warns.
My stomach rebels when I see the raw, tortured look on his face, his worry hitting like a fist to my gut. I suck in a hurried breath and it’s all I can do to inflate my lungs.
“And we could end up winning,” I counter, sounding more breathless than I would have liked. “Either way, you know we have to try, and I’m not about to walk away from Logan’s family. They’re missing because of me, Stone.” I wave my finger back and forth between the thin column of space between our bodies. “Because of us.”
The air between us charges, a volatile eruption of emotion that neither of us can keep in check. I’m sure anyone within a fifty mile radius can feel it, and if we don’t get it under control it will surely trigger a reaction from the wolves around us. Stone fists his hands, his predatory glance going from me, to Logan, back to me again.
“Logan never should have let you go back to the compound. You were finally safe and he should have ensured you stayed that way. It only proves he can’t take care of you the way I can, Pride.”
When I sense his mounting fury, I work to keep my own anger in check and try to reason with him, but as I do it simply reminds me that he’s been imprisoned his whole life and is reacting the only way he knows how.
“First,” I say in a calm voice that belies my emotions, “it wasn’t Logan’s choice to go back it was mine. And I wasn’t safe, Stone, inside the compound or out. What happened here proves that.” I wave my hands around. “I could have been a part of all this. None of us will ever be safe until we stop the PTF.” I lower my voice, and add, “Besides, did you really think I’d leave you there, to suffer at the hands of the master while I basked in my freedom?” I give a slow shake of my head. “Maybe you don’t know me so well, after all.”
“You’re wrong, Pride. I know you better than anyone knows you, maybe even better than you know yourself.” He goes quiet for a long time, then his voice is dark, grief-stricken, and completely possessive when he finally says, “I let you walk away from me once. But you came back and now that we’re together again, I won’t be able to let you do it a second time.” He exhales slowly and adds, “I can’t.”
When I hear the need in his voice, a storm rolls through me and my gut clenches. “Stone, please. Don’t.”
“I can’t, Pride.” He gives a slow shake of his head. His hair falls forward to mask his eyes, but it does nothing to hide his emotions when he says, “I won’t be able to make it through it. Not again.”

Enjoy the boy while you can and simply put up a sign in the bathroom, “If you can’t shoot straight, sit.” Or if the issue is leaving the seat up, “Put the seat down, or there will be a padlock placed on the refrigerator.” That usually gets them! Who says the punishment has to fit the crime? Boys need extreme measures, and you have to hit them where it hurts…chow…just sayin’.
Cat have no idea how you do it. I’d be more than a mess. He’s such a great kid and you’re an amazing mom. By the way is that the new cover – so love it. Love this series!!! 😆
Wow! You really know how to deliver with a bang and keep us on the edge of our seat. Thank you for the sneak peek into the new book, it was great.
I’m sure you’re enjoying every moment you spend with your son, in spite of the nervous break down…… 😉

Ukraine's technically impressive but neglected space industry is attracting fresh American commercial spaceflight interest
From a 15th-floor balcony overlooking Dnipro’s Yuri Gagarin Park, 61-year-old American John Isella looks east beyond the city skyline toward the Dnieper River. A forested expanse stretches to the horizon in the direction of the war, which is about four hours away by car if you wanted to drive there.
A former NASA engineer, Isella lives in Ukraine full time as the director of international business development for Firefly Aerospace, an American commercial spaceflight company.
Headquartered in Cedar Park, Texas, Firefly Aerospace is owned by a visionary, a 41-year-old Ukrainian entrepreneur named Max Polyakov whose vision is to leverage the legacy of Ukraine’s Soviet space program to usher in a new era of more affordable commercial spaceflight ventures.
The company shares the top floors of a modern office building with a nonprofit organization called Noosphere—also owned by Polyakov—which supports high-tech innovators and enterprises in 17 countries.
Bespectacled and soft-spoken, Isella’s emotionally moderated demeanor is what you’d expect from a systems engineer who, over the course of an eclectic career, has worked on projects spanning the gamut from the Hubble Space Telescope to classified Department of Defense programs.
“It’s fascinating to be in a position in this industry to watch things really take off—so to speak,” Isella says, cracking a grin.
Standing beside Isella on the panoramic balcony is Michael Ryabokon, the chief operating officer for Noosphere Ventures—Noosphere’s venture capital branch.
With short-cropped blond hair and a solid build, Ryabokon is outspoken and effusively enthusiastic about the future of Ukraine’s high-tech industries like space flight and robotics. A former Ukrainian army artillery officer, he has a penchant for whisky and cigars and all things military. He’s also deeply patriotic.
“Ukraine has a lot of reasons to be proud,” Ryabokon says. “We’re building a better future for ourselves.”
Ryabokon points to an array of massive metal towers, which interrupt Dnipro’s industrial skyline. During the Cold War, Ryabokon explains, the towers were used to jam electromagnetic signals.
“America was the enemy, then,” Ryabokon says. “Now, Russia is the enemy and America is our friend. Times have changed, huh?”
“This was the heart of the evil empire,” Isella adds with a wry grin, referencing former U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s famous characterization of the Soviet Union.
For Firefly’s Soviet space program veterans, who form the backbone of its burgeoning operations in Ukraine, working for an American commercial spaceflight company would have been unimaginable during the Soviet era, when Ukraine’s space program was a state secret of the highest order.
For their part, Ukraine’s up-and-coming millennial generation of spaceflight innovators sees the commercial spaceflight industry as a potential economic boon to their country. But, more importantly, they want to inspire the Ukrainian people, who’ve lived amid the backdrop of revolution and war for more than four years.
Spread across the west bank of the Dnieper River in central Ukraine, Dnipro is an industrial city of about 1 million people. Roughly 40 percent of the Soviet Union’s space program industry was located in Dnipro during the Cold War. It’s where Soviet engineers designed and built rockets such as the Satan intercontinental ballistic missile, which was designed to strike the United States with nuclear weapons.
During the Soviet era, the spaceflight secrets locked away in Dnipro were important enough that the Kremlin designated it a “closed city.” No foreigners were allowed in, and Soviet citizens needed a special permit to visit.
Today, Dnipro’s role in the Soviet space program remains a rare piece of Soviet history Ukrainians choose to embrace and celebrate, rather than forget.
In April 1961, Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin was the first man in space, beating the American Alan Shepard by three weeks. Along with other historic spaceflight achievements like the Sputnik satellite launch in 1957, the Soviet space program was an indelible source of pride for Soviet citizens in the decades following the apocalyptic toll of the World War II.
(Official estimates vary, but roughly 8 million Ukrainians died in the war from 1941 to 1945. That number represents roughly 20 percent of Ukraine’s pre-war population of 41.7 million people.)
After more than four years of nonstop combat, Ukrainian troops remain hunkered down in trenches and ad hoc forts along a 250-mile-long front line in the country’s embattled, southeastern Donbas region. There, Ukraine’s military continues to fight a grinding, static war against a combined force of pro-Russian separatists and Russian regulars.
Every day in Ukraine’s embattled Donbas region, artillery still thunders in a trench war that has, so far, killed more than 10,300 Ukrainians and continues to claim the life of one Ukrainian soldier every three days.
The conflict has spurred a Ukrainian cultural divorce from Russia. To that end, in 2015, Ukraine outlawed all symbols and relics of the Soviet Union. Since then, all the remaining statues of Vladimir Lenin have come down. It’s now illegal to display the hammer and sickle flag or to play the Soviet national anthem. All Soviet names were also replaced. For its part, the city once known as Dnipropetrovsk was renamed to today’s “Dnipro”—the excised “petrovsk” referred to Communist leader Grigory Petrovsky.
Despite the cultural purge of all things Soviet, Ukrainians see their country’s Soviet space program heritage through a more positive lens than other artifacts of their Soviet past. Today, with all the statues of Lenin reduced to empty pedestals, Dnipro’s Gagarin Avenue and Yuri Gagarin Park still retain their Soviet-era names.
Similarly, when it comes to Ukraine’s future, its burgeoning commercial space flight industry is a uniquely powerful symbol of progress.
For his part, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko was on hand to celebrate the opening of Firefly’s Dnipro facility in May. At the site, Firefly’s researchers—many of whom are veterans of the Soviet space program—are now testing ways of mass-producing rocket components with 3D printers.
That innovative manufacturing process is part of what sets Firefly’s business plan apart from those of other commercial spaceflight ventures, such as SpaceX.
Rather than focusing on grandiose projects like colonizing Mars or building rockets to rival NASA’s Saturn V moonshot behemoths, Firefly’s mission is to “provide economical, high-performance space launch capability for the underserved small satellite market, where secondary-payload launches are often the only option.”
A secondary payload refers to a small satellite that piggybacks on a larger orbital delivery to get to space with its own dedicated launch vehicle.
In short, Firefly is focused on building and launching smaller rockets that will launch smaller satellites. And it wants to build them cheaper than the competition. Part of Firefly’s price advantage comes from building its manufacturing base in Ukraine.
“In terms of rocketry, nothing we’re doing is revolutionary,” Isella says. “The advancements that we’re making, more evolutionary than revolutionary, are in manufacturing—making the rocket production more financially sound, more profitable.”
The Firefly Alpha is a liquid oxygen-fueled rocket, which will deliver a payload of up to 2,205 pounds to low-earth orbit, or about 1,320 pounds to a sun-synchronous orbit.
The Firefly Beta, which is at the prototype stage, is intended to link several Firefly Alpha boosters into one rocket stack. Altogether, the Firefly Beta should be able to deliver an 8,818-pound payload to low-earth orbit, or about 6,600 pounds to sun-synchronous orbit.
As a point of comparison, SpaceX’s workhorse Falcon 9 rocket can put up a payload of 50,265 pounds to low-earth orbit. And, according to SpaceX’s website, it can propel an 8,860-pound payload to Mars.
“Small to medium rockets are a market segment that’s currently underserved,” Isella says. “We’re not pushing the limits of technology. We’re a business.”
“Now, the real drivers in the space industry are the constellation concepts,” Isella continues. “That means smaller spacecraft, and more of them. Many small satellites can provide full coverage of the earth from specific orbits.”
With that in mind, a geo-analysis software project called EOS—another Noosphere venture—will be melded with the launch operations of Firefly. It will be a synergistic effort between the orbital software and the launch hardware, personnel say.
At Firefly they call it “full integration”—fusing the data-analytics arm of the company with the launch technology end. The concept is a bellwether for the future of the commercial space industry business model, Isella says.
“It will be a really aggressive offering in the marketplace as far as affordability goes,” Isella says. “We’re not just building rockets, we’re not just building spacecraft. It’s about fully integrating the data analytics piece, too. That’s what the consumer wants.”
In the short term, Firefly’s goal is to begin launching its Alpha and Beta rockets at a rate of twice a month by 2021. Further down the line, it has plans for a reusable rocket called Gamma.
The U.S. Air Force granted Firefly preliminary approval to use the former Delta launch facilities at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California—saving the company two years and $150 million by foregoing the need to build its own launch site.
“All we have to do is adapt the existing infrastructure to our rockets. It will just take months,” Isella says.
To date, Firefly has secured 10 letters of intent to purchase its rockets. The first launch of the Alpha rocket is tentatively scheduled for 2019.
The Firefly manufacturing facility in Dnipro isn’t much to look at on the outside. It matches the weathered look of many buildings in Dnipro’s industrial environs.
The factory floor is a noisy frenzy of nonstop activity as the workers, all 120 of them, purposefully execute their myriad tasks. Most of the 3D printers they operate are about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle—some are as large as a Winnebago. On this day, all the printers seem to be up and running.
“We’re combining American rocket skills and Soviet rocket skills, and no one has done that before,” says Yuriy Zabiyaka, CEO for Firefly Ukraine.
Among the older engineers and factory workers who used to work for the Soviet space program, you see echoes of both the pride and the paranoia of the Soviet era.
They tend to hunch a little closer to their computer screens, concealing what’s on them, as this American correspondent walks past. For the most part, they don’t overtly acknowledge an outsider’s presence, yet you get the sense that they’re always aware of your location, and what you’re looking at.
Technically, Firefly Ukraine is a separate company from its American counterpart. Therefore, Firefly Ukraine is subject to restrictive U.S. trade laws when it comes to rocket technology.
Firefly’s rockets fall under the U.S. government’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR—meaning the technology is classified by the U.S. State Department as militarily sensitive and its dissemination to foreign countries is limited.
The ITAR laws are meant to prevent U.S. military technology from ending up in the wrong hands. For that reason, under U.S. law, Firefly’s American arm is prohibited from sharing any technical information with Firefly Ukraine until a Technical Assistance Agreement, or TAA, is approved by the State Department.
The TAA is basically a rulebook for sharing information, which the State Department has to approve before Firefly’s U.S. operation can share any information with its Ukrainian outpost.
According to company personnel, Firefly Ukraine is the first non-U.S. company to ever apply for a TAA.
In order to get the TAA approved, Firefly has to build its entire Ukrainian infrastructure, including a fully functional manufacturing facility.
“We have to have the company set up and running here before the U.S. will give us approval,” Isella says. “So, the facilities are built, and we’re ready to kick-start the production lines when, hopefully, the TAA is approved.”
“If we get the TAA then by the end of the year we can deliver our first big components to the U.S.,” says Zabiyaka, Firefly Ukraine’s CEO.
Firefly’s engineers in Texas aren’t allowed to tell their Ukrainian counterparts what parts they’ll need, leaving Firefly Ukraine’s Soviet space veterans to rely on their professional experience to anticipate what parts the rockets will need.
At this point, the Ukrainians are experimenting with the 3D printing technology and working out the kinks in the manufacturing process so that when the TAA is finally approved, they can immediately kick-start the mass production of rocket components.
But until the TAA is approved, Firefly Ukraine operates independently. The U.S. side can’t send us materials for testing, and we can’t collaborate with them at all. We can send information to the U.S., but the U.S. side can’t respond. It’s a one-way street. But we need feedback to make the proper components for the rockets.
Meanwhile, the pending decision looms over the factory floor in Dnipro like a background static charge about to arc.
“If we don’t get the TAA, then what we’re doing here is useless,” Zabiyaka says. “Everyone is waiting for the next step. We’re all nervous. We try to believe there’s a future here.”
Amid the backdrop of the activity on the factory floor, Zabiyaka pauses to study a mockup of Firefly’s Beta rocket.
“I think a lot of people still think this is all too good to be true,” Zabiyaka says. “But, if the Ukrainian people see a Ukrainian flag and a U.S. flag on the side of a rocket lifting off into space, it would be very inspiring.”
In Dnipro, Firefly isn’t the only commercial spaceflight startup in town. A 2-year-old company called Space Electric Thruster Systems, or SETS, is designing cutting-edge electro-propulsion space thrusters for satellites.
“We’re trying to find new ways to build thrusters at a low cost,” says Viktor Serbin, the founder and CEO of SETS. “We’re taking students from university and rebuilding the electro-propulsion community here in Ukraine.”
Fair-haired and with a smile permanently affixed to his face, Serbin worked at Ukraine’s state-run Yuzhmash rocket construction company for five years before joining SETS. He says leftover Soviet bureaucratic malaise has stifled Ukraine’s modern state-run space program.
“It’s difficult to work there, if you’re talking about their mentality,” Serbin says, describing the Yuzhmash bureaucracy. “Maybe, sometimes, people want to change something,” he adds, “but it’s difficult to change things. It’s like a big whale trying to turn.”
Like Firefly, SETS belongs to the Noosphere organization.The company’s Dnipro workshop has the feel of a Silicon Valley startup. The desks don’t have dividers. The team is an eclectic mix of fresh university graduates and veterans of the Soviet space program. They’re all dressed casually and their demeanor is relaxed. Some younger personnel have earbuds in as they work, their heads bobbing to the music.
The laid back work environment reflects Serbin’s leadership vision. His idea is to use Soviet-era spaceflight know-how—but to ditch the Soviet-era mentality.
“I believe in the future we can do something different, we can change the way things are done in our country,” Serbin says. “But it’s tough sometimes to remove people from this Soviet mentality, so it’s very important to have the right climate in here. We’re trying to think differently.”
“We broke with the Soviet mode of thinking,” says Olexandr Petrenko, a professor of astronautical engineering and a veteran of the Soviet space program who is chief technology officer for SETS.
Electro-propulsion is a means of thrust that can operate in the vacuum of space, where there is no available oxygen to fuel combustion. Electro-propulsion thrusters are smaller and use less fuel than other orbital thrusters. Therefore, Serbin says, the technology can extend the current orbital lifespan of geostationary satellites to 21 years, up from the current number of about 12 to 17 years.
NASA expects the number of satellites with electric thrust will increase by 30 percent within 10 years, Serbin explains.
Serbin and Petrenko stand back to proudly observe as they demonstrate one of their electro-propulsion thrusters for this correspondent. Inside a vacuum tube, the thruster silently emits a purple plasma cone. Admittedly, it’s beautiful and impressive.
SETS’ thrusters are still in the design phase, but Serbin anticipates they’ll be ready for spaceflight around spring of 2019. And his team is working tirelessly to that end.
“If you come here on a Saturday, 80 percent of my guys will be here,” Serbin says. “I tell them to go on vacation, but they won’t listen.”
“They like the work, and the mission,” Serbin says. Then, as is his habit, he smiles broadly and adds, “And they love the dream.”

Ensure full liability for individuals and corporations; private property rights as a protector of the environment
Pollution of other people’s property is wrong. Strict liability, not government agencies and arbitrary standards, should regulate pollution. We advocate repeal of the laws that prevent full ownership of the air and water above and below land, thus denying individuals protection under the law against polluters. Private property rights must replace public property. We further advocate repeal of corporate limited liability laws protecting the individuals who own or manage corporations from the personal liability of pollution. We further advocate the repeal of sovereign immunity laws, which protect those in charge of government property, utilities and military installations from the personal liability of pollution.
One reason a person becomes a Libertarian is that they recognize how government has enabled the destruction of the environment through cronyism. Governments are the biggest polluters of the environment worldwide. From war, their militaries and the creation of the corporation. The invention of the corporation was to politically protect individuals from legal action for their neglectful decisions towards the environment along with other issues. This creates a moral hazard when individuals are not held accountable but a mythical creature called the corporation. In the end, the fine is paid for by the employees through less or lowered compensation. The executives are not hurt and the corporation will do all it can not to pass these costs onto the customer. Projected fines and penalties associated with the pollution are actually apart of the cost analysis for many companies. Thus companies are not incentivized to be stewards of the environment but instead are able to stagnate as long as the profits are protected by limited liability laws.
Free the market. Example – End government protections such as caps on liability if a disaster happens. If an oil rig cannot get insured to drill then that activity does not happen. If a pipeline cannot be laid by the company negotiating with private property owners then it does not get laid. Governments using eminent domain for financial gains is a coercive behavior to enrich the politically favored groups at the expense of private property owners and potentially putting the environment at risk.
Reform the patent system. The patent system has become a system of corporate protection against competition as patents are bought by the rich and locked away. As patents can be worded so vaguely that years of lawsuits and or threat of lawsuit from patent trolls stifles new businesses, new innovations and the economy.
There will be times when externalities come into the equation and property rights alone cannot solve the issue. It is in these cases government intervention may be appropriate.
The Libertarian Party is the only party that can be relied upon to defend all your freedoms, all the time. Join us today!
Roger Misbach is the Libertarian Party of Connecticut's Nominee for the 83 General Assembly District.
"I live in Meriden with My wife Ellen and my three kids. My oldest Briana is a graduate of Southern, Allison is attending Southern, and my youngest Alex will be at Uconn this fall. I grew up in North Haven and at twelve years old started working on a farm. I was a flooring installer out of High School and worked locally in Wallingford and Meriden. My wife and I settled in South Meriden 17 years ago. Our kids attended Meriden Schools. We love it here; it's where we call home. We're getting older, and it's time to start thinking about our next chapter in life. Like many of us we worry about retiring here, can we afford it? How much worse is it going to get? We also worry about our kids, Can they find a good job? Start their own family? We are Like many families being close to one another is important. No one wants to leave their home; it's worse when your government is forcing you from your home
What a mess the duopoly has made of Connecticut. Our license plates should not say the Constitution state; our representatives have legislated liberty and personal freedom away. I blame both parties because one party was in control and the other failed to be the balance. This state is a mess, No growth, no jobs, declining population, crumbling roads and our legislature spends their time debating bills we can't afford and laws that infringe even further on the rights of the people of Connecticut.
I'm often asked why do you bother trying to fight the two-party system? It's hard one party wants to provide everything and spend like drunken sailors, and the other says we need to cut cut cut with no actual plan. There is no parent in the room. Cronyism runs rampant and they kick the can down the road time and time again.
There is a better way. There is a chance to put some checks and balances on the system. New innovative ideas to transform Connecticut from a State heading towards ruin and a beacon for the country of liberty and justice. My voice, as well as the whole Libertarian ticket, have a way forward for Connecticut. Jobs, Growth, Opportunity, life liberty, and justice for all. Join us, vote for us, take the leap from the lesser of two evils and choose the one actual party of freedom. The rest of the country is full of optimism and growing the Libertarian party can get Connecticut on that train.
2) Eliminate unnecessary taxes that make up less than 2 percent of the state's revenue. They cost more to collect than they take in.
3) Give local schools the freedom to innovate and choose whats best for their school system. Eliminate the unwanted burdens Hartford puts on cities and towns.
I vow to do my part to restore Connecticut and put her back on top where she belongs. I will take a pay cut; I will not receive a pension. I will serve my State; my state will not serve me."
I just can’t let my recent interaction with a company go unwritten about! That company is Equal Exchange and if you don’t already drink their coffee, you should. I drink lots and lots of it and mostly because they offer fair trade and organic coffee, but also many other products as well, such as cocoa and chocolate!! So recently I bought my usual bag and got about half through it and something just didn’t smell or taste right about it. I took a few minutes and wrote an email to the company on a Tuesday morning and within only two hours I had a response from Sharyn in Customer Service. She requested specifics about the bag of coffee that I bought and apologized. She also said she would send me a replacement bag at no charge. Wow! I was so pleased at this outcome and so happy to be expecting a package in the mail! Okay, here is the crazy and amazing part…..the very following day the big brown delivery truck pulled up to the front of my house and the driver handed me a box. I was puzzled and looked at the address. It was from Equal Exchange! What amazing customer service! I practically sprinted into the house and started a pot of coffee. Within less than 48 hours from my initial email I was sipping my favorite coffee! Equal Exchange is truly a wonderful company and I recommend to everyone to try. Not only do they care about the farmers they work with and the environment that we live in, but obviously customer service is of the highest priority!

Hello everyone! I hope that you have enjoyed Christmas with your families and friends. It's hard to believe that the year is nearly over. Today I am sharing a layout that I have created following the Prima BAP sketch for December. I had a chance to use my Prima oil pastels and I can say that they are wonderful to use. I used clear gesso on my paper to prime before applying them and then I used a waterbrush and blended away! They also work well with the color bloom sprays.

The vast majority of people who take the CAT-ASVAB test finish it as the time constraints are not very aggressive. However, if a respondent isn’t able to finish in time, the remaining unanswered questions are scored as if the respondent had answered them randomly. This is obviously not an ideal way to finish up the test and most often results in even poorer scores.

We offer flowers at places of worship symbolizing our love and belief. Showering flowers is a religious ritual in India. Flowers are a symbol of devotion and reverence, and it is believed that the flowers should be discarded into water bodies to respect their sanctity. But no one think of the aftermath? Every year approximately 80, 00,000 tons of waste flowers are dumped in the rivers choking them to death Sadly, these sacred flowers rot in rivers – killing fishes and creating havoc in the fragile ecosphere of the water body and cause enormous pollution. The pesticides and chemical fertilizers used to grow flowers mixes with the river water making it highly toxic. We always tend to blame the industrial waste but never give a think to flower pollution. Ankit and Karan were shocked and sad with the magnitude of the problem. They developed several ways to utilize these disposed flowers to ensure that devotion doesn’t turn into pollution, and hence the company helpusgreen was born.
At helpusgreen they collect these flowers and recycle them into awesome – bio fertilizer, Incense, bathing bars etc. Helpusgreen products not just reduce the flower waste but bring a bit of divine your home. Their work is based on our love for Nature and chemical free life. Helpusgreen is a step towards pollution free rivers!!

The highly anticipated debut EP from rising artist King Princess, Make My Bed, came out in June on Mark Ronson’s Zelig Records, which marks the label’s first release. The EP features breakout singles, “1950” and “Talia” that have been streamed more than 100 million times to date—along with three previously unheard tracks written and produced by King Princess. The product of a musical family, King Princess is the stage name for Mikaela Straus, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY and spent much of her childhood tinkering on the vintage Neve board in her father’s Brooklyn studio Mission Sound, learning instrumentation along the way. A vocalist, multi-instrumentalist, songwriter and producer, King Princess turned down a record deal at age 11, in favor of finishing school, which eventually led her to USC’s Thornton School of Music for college. She studied there for a year with legendary pianist and singer Patrice Rushen before leaving USC to pursue music full time. The aforementioned “1950” has been in heavy rotation on mainstream alternative music radio and garnered millions of streams online. The summer of 18 marks her first ever shows in only a handful of cities that have sold out instantly, including headline dates at The Troubadour in Los Angeles, New York’s The Hall at Elsewhere, two nights in San Francisco and beyond. Check out the photos of King Princess performing at her sold-out show the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco!

From the moment I heard about it, I’d always been interested in the so called ‘sport’ of Crossfit – perhaps more a morbid curiosity than anything. People always seem highly polarised and either love it or hate it, to the point of outright rage or cult-like support.
And on the other hand, everyone knows ‘THAT’ person who posts an instagram filtered photo of a barbell at 6am as though all their friends care. Don’t forget the followup photo of chicken and avocado, also carefully filtered. #paleo #cleaneating #crossfit. The law says that any workout is null and void without a photo, right?
I’ve worked out in gyms, on and off, for several years. Initially with friends, none of us with much idea what we were doing, still managing to put on a bit of muscle here and there. We gradually learned a bit more over time, but staying motivated and thus making consistent progress was the hard part.
After I moved to Melbourne from Adelaide, it was time to try it out due to the high frequency of crossfit ‘boxes’ (this is what they call their gyms, which are usually an old warehouse or one of those suites in an industrial park with a roller door). There seems to be one in every suburb without fail, all for the extraordinarily expensive price of about $180 per month.
“Our program delivers a fitness that is, by design, broad, general, and inclusive. Our specialty is not specializing. Combat, survival, many sports, and life reward this kind of fitness and, on average, punish the specialist.”
It uses barbells with olympic lifts, bodyweight exercises like pushups, cardio such as rowing and running, kettlebell movements, and gymnasium style exercises like pullups and muscle-ups.
The thing about Crossfit is it uses a whole lot of fairly advanced movements, so this is where the (very real) danger lies. Coupled with the very short weekend course that qualifies one to be a trainer, it can’t be guaranteed that any trainee under them is going to be doing things properly, or more importantly, knows when to stop. There is also a mentality amongst the more hardcore crossfitters that you have to push yourself extremely hard – sometimes to the point of injury or damage – to get the most out of it.
Still, the movements and exercises in crossfit are the kind of thing that anyone might do in some form or another while trying to get fit or gain muscle. None of it is really mystical or different, it’s just a bit of everything thrown together.
I’ve been to 4 crossfit ‘boxes’ in the Melbourne suburbs, in the next post I’ll talk about the overall experience of Crossfit in various suburbs of Melbourne, and some specifics about each ‘box’.

In Turkey, secularism, democracy, and the moderate Hanafi Sunni Islam coexist. In the November 2015 general election, 16 political parties competed for the 550-seat parliament. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s party, the Islamic Justice and Development Party (AKP), won 49.4% of the votes cast with 316 seats.[1]AKP was formed by Mr. Erdogan in 2001. It has been in power since the 2002 election.[2]
Turkish secularism, democracy, and moderate Hanafi Sunni Islam represent an existential threat to the Saudi regime. It provides a less austere, less harsh, less obtrusive way of life than the Wahhabi way of life. The Islam of Turkey appeals to the educated internet generation, especially women. Turkish women enjoy rights their sisters in Wahhabi Saudi Arabia are denied, like participation in public life, freedom from male guardianship, and a modern personal status laws and courts.
The Ottoman Empire ruled over most of the Arab world for four centuries (1517-1918). The Turkish Sultans belonged to the moderate Hanafi Sunni rite. In the Balkans, for example, they did not force their Christian subjects to convert to Islam in the sixteenth century. Had they done so, the savage sectarian wars in the former Yugoslavia four centuries later (1991-1999), would most probably not have happened. In 1492, the Ottoman Sultan, Bayezid-II (1481-1512) allowed Jews driven out from Spain and Portugal to settle in the Ottoman territories.[3]
The firm hand of the Sultans had kept religious extremism and hatred-of the–other culture in check.[4] This control was lost when the Ottoman Empire was dismembered in 1918 and separate states with different religious agendas were formed, especially the extreme Wahhabi doctrine of Saudi Arabia in 1932.
Turkey was the first independent Muslim country to separate religion from the state, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empirein the First World War. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk (1881-1938) blamed Islam’s rigidity during the previous four centuries for the decline and calamitous fall of the empire. While Europe was undergoing Christian reformation and progressing towards the industrial revolution, Ottoman modernization was impeded by the ulama’s resistance to innovation.
Although Turkey’s reforms evolved cautiously since the early 1800s under the reign of Sultan Mahmut II (1808-1839) and his son, Sultan Abdulmecit (1839-1861), their speed and depth became revolutionary under Ataturk. Between 1924 and 1935, Ataturk implemented a rapid and extensive program of fundamental change in Turkish society the likes of which the Islamic world had never seen. In addition to abolishing the Islamic caliphate (March 3, 1924), the Kemalist secular revolution included abolishing Shari’a laws and courts (1926), which was replaced by the Swiss civil code and the Italian penal code. It also replaced the fez by the Western-style hat or cap (1925), the Islamic calendar by Western calendar (1926), Latin alphabet instead of Arabic alphabet (1928), Western weights and measures (1931), and Sunday as the day of rest (1935) instead of Friday.
Arabs, on the other hand, believed that the abandonment of Islam by the sultans was to blame for the Ottoman defeat. From such thinking, the Wahhabi State in Saudi Arabia was born in 1932 and the Muslim Brotherhood organization was formed in Egypt in 1928.
While it is true that Erdogan has been taking tough measures against his critics, especially the media, he has not repealed Ataturk’s secular laws. Cosmetics aside, Erdogan has not altered any of Ataturk’s basic reforms. The Swiss civil code and the Italian penal code, which replaced Shari’a laws and courts in 1926 are sacrosanct. Civil marriage,gender equality in divorce, custody, and inheritance continue to be the laws of the land. Polygamy is illegal. The changes Erdogan effected since AKP came to power in 2002 have been rather modest: construction of mosques, lifting the ban on wearing the hijab (scarf over a woman’s hair), encouraging enrolment in Islamic schools, restricting the sale of alcohol, and the introduction of Islamic banking.
On the other hand, Erdogan added to the Ataturk reforms. He has adopted a series of fundamental judicial reforms to harmonize Turkey’s legal system with that of the European Union as part of Turkey’s interest in joining the EU. In January 2004, Turkey abolished the death penalty.[5] In 2009, the judicial provisions that allowed civilians to be tried in military courts were removed from the Turkish Constitution.[6] Judicial reforms were also adopted to restructure domestic judicial institutions in terms of their power and functions. The 2010 constitutional referendum expanded the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors from 7 members to 22.[7] Also, it granted Turkish citizens the right to individually apply to the Constitutional Court if government decisions, laws or the implementation of laws violate their basic rights and fundamental freedoms.[8]
Ankara’s contribution to a democratic Islam in the Arab world can be a sharp ideological weapon to counter the Wahhabi ideology that grips Islamist terror organizations. Turkey’s democratic Islam is the cure to Arab rulers' absolute dictatorship, which they impose in the name of Islam, whether kings or military presidents. For this alone, the US and its allies should give Turkey high marks. The US and its allies owe Turkey a debt of gratitude.
Turkey helped spread democracy in the Arab world through the Muslim Brotherhood. The Brotherhood embraced democratic elections and coalition governments during the brief period of the Arab Spring in Egypt (June 2012, until General al-Sisi's coup a year later), Tunisia (October 2011), Morocco (November 2011), Jordan (September 2016), and Kuwait (November 2016). As far back as 1961, in Syria, the Brotherhood was a part of the a democratically elected Parliament and coalition cabinet. No other organization could be as effective as the Brotherhood in convincing the millions of Arab Sunni masses that democracy is compatible with Islam. The Brotherhood possesses the religious credibility to be an agent of change.
The demonization of Mr. Erdogan and the Muslim Brotherhood by the US and Western politicians and media has wrecked the Arab Spring. In the confrontation between democrats and autocrats in the Arab world, the democratic West sides with the oil autocrats: A hypocritical and Machiavellian stance which brings into question whether the democratic West is truly interested in spreading democracy in Arab countries.

Most of us are aware of the recent protocol flaw vulnerability in SSLv3. Officially designated CVE-2014-3566, it is more commonly referred to as the “POODLE” (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) vulnerability.
The vulnerability is a result of a flaw in the way that the (now old) SSLv3 protocol behaves and operates. There is a Ubuntu-specific question on the POODLE vulnerability on Ask Ubuntu (link) which answers common questions on it. There is also a more general question on the POODLE vulnerability on the Information Security Stack Exchange site (link) with more general details on the POODLE vulnerability. If you would like more details, you should refer to those sites, or read the OpenSSL Whitepaper on the POODLE vulnerability (link).
As this is a protocol flaw in SSLv3, ALL implementations of SSLv3 are affected, so the only way to truly protect against POODLE is to disable SSLv3 protocol support in your web application, whether it be software you write, or hosted by a web server.
Since the recommendation is to no longer use SSLv3, the simplest thing to do is disable SSLv3 for your site. In nginx, this is very simple to achieve.
Typically, one would have SSL enabled on their site with the following protocols line or similar if using the example in the default-shipped configuration files (in latest Debian or the NGINX PPAs, prior to the latest updates that happened in the past week or so):
To resolve this issue and disable SSLv3 support, we merely need to use the following instead to use only TLS:
Note that on really old implementations of OpenSSL, you won’t be able to get TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2, so at the very least you can just have TLSv1 on the ssl_protocols line. You should probably consider updating to a more recent version of OpenSSL, though, because of other risks/issues in OpenSSL.
More importantly than just disabling SSLv3, you should definitely update your OpenSSL, or whatever SSL implementation you use, to receive support for TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV. There is an attack vector that would make you vulnerable to POODLE by starting a TLS session, but then falling back to SSLv3, and then open you to the POODLE vulnerability. By updating, and then having the use of TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV, you will be protecting yourself from protocol downgrading attacks which would also make you vulnerable to POODLE.
Fortunately for all users of Ubuntu, the OpenSSL packages were updated to protect against SSL downgrade attacks. This is detailed in “USN-2385-1: OpenSSL vulnerabilities” (link). Simply running sudo apt-get update with the security repositories enabled should get you the OpenSSL update to address this.
Due to the vulnerability, and Debian already having these changes done, I was able to get in a last-minute update (courtesy of the Ubuntu Security Team and the Ubuntu Release Team), into the nginx package for the Utopic (14.10) release, which happened officially yesterday (October 23, 2014). In Utopic, the nginx package’s default config does NOT have SSLv3 on the ssl_protocols line. All other supported versions of Ubuntu do not have this change (this means that Precise and Trusty are both affected).
Of course, many users of Ubuntu and nginx like the newer features of the latest nginx Stable or Mainline releases. This is why the nginx PPAs exist. Originally maintained by some of the Debian maintainers of the nginx package, I’ve taken primary responsibility of updating the nginx packages, and keeping them in sync (as close as I can) to the Debian nginx packaging.
As of today (October 24, 2014), both the Stable and Mainline PPAs have been updated to be in sync with the latest Debian packaging of the nginx package. This includes the removal of SSLv3 from the default ssl_protocols line.
Fortunately, like Ubuntu, Debian has also updated the OpenSSL packages to protect against SSL downgrade attacks. This is detailed in “DSA-3053-1 openssl — security update” (link). Like in Ubuntu, this can be fixed by running sudo apt-get update or similar to update your packages.
If you are on Debian Unstable, you are in luck. The Debian package in Unstable has this change in it already.
If you are on Debian Testing or Debian Stable or Debian Old Stable, you’re unfortunately out of luck, this change isn’t in those versions of the package yet. You can easily do the aforementioned changes, though, and fix your configs to disable SSLv3.
Ubuntu: Get notified of package changes during `apt-get upgrade` and `apt-get dist-upgrade` NGINX in Ubuntu, PPAs, and Debian: naxsi packages dropped as of September 26, 2014 (repost)

She been posting up a few articles about avatar proportion and height. A subject that interests me quite a bit. Given, I’m usually a bit short. XD
That don’t bug me none. I kinda want to be 5’0″, but, recent neck adjustments have offset that. (>_<)
Do you try and keep your avatar’s body proportionate and similar to the “average” proportions pictured above? – Yes. I simply want to look good and I think part of looking good is being some sort of believable and natural form. I’m not saying realistic. Just enough so that people can believe that I have some sense of reality. (^_^)
What do you dislike the most about the SL avatar mesh? – I don’t like how the tummy joins with the chest. It could have been made far more flexible. Instead what we get is tummy-block mates with chest-block and if they hit any offset from each other, they just shear, overlap, and split. This ain’t so bad when standing still, but when dancing, it’s really yucky! (>_<)
Does it bother you when you see other avatars that are not proportionate at all? – Yes, it do! I mean, to each their own. But I don’t have to like it. Like, when I see a 7′ tall amazonian thingamabob with legs twice as long as their torso, I totally go all judgmental on them in my head. Like, do they even realize how crooked and wonky they are? Or are they just trying to machismo up and be taller than everyone else because tall is power? (O.o)
Even though this is a virtual world and people can be anything they want to be, do you feel when they are in human form, they should try to keep their proportions close to average? – Naw. People should do what they like. It’s a matter of freedom gifted to us by our virtual reality. At the same time, people should realize the glass house they’re in when they’ve determined that another’s shape is “wrong” and do things like ban each other or make wild and potentially criminal accusations. (>_<)
This sim is to be constructed to-scale. Meaning the meter will be honored as-is and “short” avatars will be considered proper adult height. Avatars taller than 1.8 meters in real prim height will be considered creatures of fantasy and lore and will NOT be used as reference in order to falsely accuse properly scaled avatars of being depictions of children.

Omg YES to the tummy/chest join! I spend a LOT of time editing this region in photos. I will often forgo using an otherwise lovely pose if this becomes too much of an issue!
Nice! Thanks for sharing. My usual shape is still around 6 foot… which seems silly seeing as how the RL me isn’t even that tall. I’ve been meaning to do some retuning lately… mind if I steal with pride?

Saif Ali Khan And Amrita Singh daughter Sara Ali Khan is all set make her debut in movie Kedarnath Opposite Sushant Singh Rajput. The team has traveled to Dehradun where they have started shooting for the project since September 3. The said project has been helmed by Abhishek Kapoor and the movie is a love story set in the holy town of Kedarnath. The makers of the films are planning to release the movie by 2018.
Director Abhishek Kapoor, who has also co-producing the movie was quoted saying, “This coalition of producing partners has added tremendous value to our film, and we are grateful and excited to have their backing.” The movie is also special as it marks the reunion of actor and director Jodi who’s last worked in Kai Po Che and movie was appreciated by critics and masses alike. The movie schedule began last month in Kedarnath, as a result, the cast and crew had been shooting for the film. The director of the movie, Abhishek Kapoor, took to his social media account and informed that the first schedule of the movie has finished.
In the post, the director wrote, “With a lot of hope and excitement we left Mumbai for #kedarnath not sure if what we would come back with would do justice to our vision. It was nothing short of an expedition Given the terrain and weather we would face. Having wrapped and on our way back, thanks to a great crew, and supporting producers #kriarjentertainment #arjunkapoor @iprernaarora @pragyadav ..I’m glad our smiles are still intact #kedarnaththemovie @guyintheskypictures @sushantsinghrajput #saraalikhan #jaibholenath #uttarakhand #pilgrimage #yatra #movie #passion #artists #love #loveisapilgrimage”.

The movie is constant in the news as it marks the debut of star kid Sara Ali Khan. A while back we have heard the news the Sara Ali Khan was throwing tantrums on the set had been doing the rounds. The makers of the movie cleared the air and were quoted saying that, “Sara is a beautiful mix of innocence and talent. She is an intelligent girl, well-read and educated, she knows how the industry functions but she is not afraid to work hard and ask questions, which is just what we needed for Kedarnath. She has totally won over the crew of the film. Sara picked the vibe at the rehearsals itself so her first day was smooth going, to say the least. Everyone on the sets stopped to watch her perform. For someone who is doing her first film, she was very comfortable in front of the camera and a big outdoor unit.”
The fans are eagerly awaiting for the release of the movie and one of the reason being we will get to watch the chemistry of the two actors! Here are few pictures from the sets:-
I dont know why this handsome bloke with me is behind the camera. Maybe cause hes one of the brightest and most stable minds around in the business.. my partner #arjunnkapoor of @kriarj just before v kick off this sched @guyintheskypictures @iprernaarora @pragyadav #kedarnaththemovie #kedarnath #jaibholenath 🙏

Gali Galeiyan is the movie which stars Manoj Bajpayee,Neeraj Kabi, Shahana Goswami and Ranvir Shorey. We are really aware of this fact that Cinema allows us to be peep into the strangers life and to follow them and an actor has to get into the character of the star to be seen like him.
I have finally made my way out, but now it’s your time to #EnterTheMaze! Talking to you all from Laddakh@GaliGuleiyan is now in cinemas. Hope your journey will be as fantastic as it has been for me. Book your tickets here (Link in bio) @RanvirShorey @ShahanaGoswami @himanshu_A_M @dipeshjainfilm #NeerajKabi #OmSingh #ShuchiJain #GaliGuleiyan #InTheShadows Link to be updated in the bio: bit.ly/GaliGuleiyan_PayTM
This movie has got 3.5 out of total 5.Promoted as a psychological thriller, Gali Guleiyan is light on suspense and you can see the twist a mile off. However, as the psychological portrait of the character, it is perhaps one of the best films to come out in a long time.

“HAPPY Thais” is the latest solo exhibition of internationally-renown Thai artist, Sutee Kunavichayanont. The exhibition features two set of works. The first work under the same title, “HAPPY Thais” is a print series, aiming to explore the world that driven by the power of bureaucracy. It reveals repetitive facial expression of happiness of the Thais in the form of large-scaled wall paper and prints on canvas.
In different approach, “Gaze the Looking Glass”, the other work in the exhibition, adopts a rather solemn gesture towards the subject. Sutee persuasively invites viewers to ‘gaze’ and ‘read’ in reverse, provided words on cardboards, through the looking glass, as of ‘Hollywood mirror’ or ‘vanity desk’, in order to reveal the truth.
Apart from being shown extensively in Thailand, Sutee’s works have been featured in art venue throughout the world such as the Liverpool Biennial (1999) in UK, the Asia Pacific Triennial (2006) in Australia, the Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale (2002) in Japan, and the Asian Art Biennial (2015) in Taiwan. And the exhibition “Happy THAIs” will happen in the period where the international art exhibition like “Bangkok Art Biennale 2018” will be happened on. This considered to be a phenomenal world class exhibition that gathers all world class artist and celebrities from all over the world and Bangkok. Number 1 Gallery hereby inviting you to be the part of this remarkable time and also be the significant support that will drives Thailand’s art society to be even bigger!
"I urge you to pursue preserving your personal history to allow your children and grandchildren to know who you were as a child and what your hopes and dreams were."
"It's a great way to organize your family's memories into a keepsake album...it's got a place for you to write, and it's got some really provocative questions to ask your family members that get into everything. It's really cool!"
"We bought this for our 81 year old Father for Christmas. Besides being a Dad to us 8 kids, he is a well loved retired Pastor. Dad's mind is filled with many, many precious memories. He teared up when we gave him this gift, and has spent the winter filling in the pages. He plans to give it back to us as a gift someday. Beautiful present!"
"I purchased this last year and decided to make an identical one for me, my sister and my brother of my father's life for Christmas. Upon my brother's receipt of the gift, my brother was so overcome with emotion, it made my day. To have a part of your family that you never would have had, but that someone took the time to put a precious loved one's life on paper, is something that will be enjoyed by generations to come. How priceless!"
"I want to express my appreciation for the wonderful Cherished Memories. My mother and I live 3000 miles apart - she's in East Tennessee and I'm in Long Beach, California - and I've been capturing her life story when we talk on the telephone. Sometimes we'll do it every week, for 20-40 minutes... sometimes not... but it pleases my mother to be asked about her life. Then invariably she remembers something that opens my eyes to who she was as a little girl and a teenager... and how life occurred for her... and I feel my love and appreciation for her deepen in my heart. Often she recalls something that has us both belly laughing in shared delight. The result is that every time my mother and I talk, we're closer than ever and our love and appreciation continue to deepen. Honestly, we could be on opposite ends of the globe, and it wouldn't matter... Cherished Memories has eliminated the distance between my mother and me and made our relationship richer."
"Organization is one of the most effective stress reduction strategies for anyone - especially for caregivers. Keeping track all of your vital documents in this easy-to-access Senior Organizer system will provide you and your family with peace of mind. You'll have medical, legal and financial information at your finger tips and be prepared for any emergency. "
"Senior Organizer is a supremely valuable product that captures the vital information to which everyone needs immediate access."
"I've seen so many people incur needless expense and lose valuable time because they were not prepared when a family or medical crisis occurred. The Senior Organizer makes categorizing personal, financial, legal and medical information easy, and provides you and your loved ones with peace of mind."
"Well Designed Organizational Tool. I am a legal aid attorney who spends a lot of time helping seniors and am also the owner of an online medical supply and equipment business. So many of the seniors I talk to struggle to locate important information and documents. This can often add confusion and stress to many of the difficult issues seniors already have to face. This book can help enormously and is an excellent, well designed organizational tool. It will save time and offer peace of mind to seniors and those who help care for them."
Imagine this: You get an unexpected telephone call saying that your mother, or your grandfather, has fallen and broken a hip. Your loved one needs hospitalization, and the staff has some questions about Medicare, Social Security, medication, and who has legal authority to make medical decisions if they cannot? Where is the health care proxy? You have been caught unprepared and don't know the answers. You go through a jumble of papers and can't begin to make sense of them.
Time for a one-stop, file-and-find system - the kind of thing people say they'll do someday. ''The Senior Organizer'' is an option - and it looks like a good one.
This new guide was designed to help families set up basic information for a variety of crises or predicaments - from an illness, such as a stroke or diabetes, to plumbing emergencies, tax filing deadlines and personal, legal or financial decisions.
Paula Beaulieu, director of emergency services at South Shore Hospital in Weymouth, said that having some sort of guide ''sounds like a great idea. I have a 90-year-old mother in western Massachusetts and I'm going to look into it.''
When anyone arrives at a hospital emergency room, Beaulieu said, it is critical to know quickly all the medications they take, any allergies, and who their emergency contacts are, with cell phone numbers.
As our population ages it has created a whole new market for items related to care of the elderly. The Senior Organizer was written for just this target audience- the elderly and the family members who care for them.
At first glance The Senior Organizer seems too basic for publication. It appears to be a book of fill in the blank forms. And, on closer examination, that is what the book really contains. But the beauty of the book, and what makes it a great investment, is its absolute comprehensiveness. The authors have thought of every possible aspect of life that needs to be tracked, organized and maintained. The sections are personal, medical and legal/financial. They include everything from forms to fill out on all medicines, eye glasses and doctors to where in a house the emergency shut off items are. It is impossible to think any information that is not covered. If a family takes the time to thoroughly fill out each form, they will be ready for any situation. Ideally, every family should have a copy of this book and its forms completed in case of an emergency. While it was created for the elderly it is a great organizational tool for every adult, regardless of age.
My husband is a nurse and I am an accountant. We have been concerned about my independent 82 year old mother who still lives on her own. The SENIOR ORGANIZER was the answer to our prayers. These easy to follow binders helped us organize her medical care as well as knowing where all her financial information was. By filling out these great binders, we also found out what still needed to be addressed. Wonderful concept! Every family should get the set.
My wife bought this set a while ago. We live in Oak Park, CA and last month we got evacuated from our house because of the fires. It was so easy for us to grab our Senior Organizer binders, knowing that we had all our important documents and records inside, in one place. They make it easy to be organized!
The Senior Organizer is an all encompassing A to Z guide of all the information anyone would ever need to collect regarding the ins and outs of any senior's life. Everything is covered. This guide will help you gather life-saving and personal info with regards to your senior. Bravo to the authors for providing us with all the essential questions to ask - I wouldn't have known where to start! I achieved great peace of mind knowing all there is to know about my Mother from her health care needs and her daily life, right the way through to her last wishes. My mother is also comforted by the fact that I know all there is to know about what is going on in her life. Every household needs this incredible book - we owe it to our loved ones.
'The Senior Organizer" is a vault of information that will help in times of crisis. This book should be completed while "you are healthy and strong so you can get peace of mind, knowing that you're organized and equipped to handle all situations." None of us knows what lies ahead. Accidents and illnesses come when least expected. Once filled out this book will contain essential information that will assist you or someone you love when need arises.
There are two parts to "The Senior Organizer." Part one contains personal and medical information. There is a place to list prescription, pharmacy, and herbal medicines. There is a place to record doctor visits. How many times have you gone to the doctor and they want a medical history? There are specific pages to keep a record of this. There are pages to record insurance information. We each have a daily routine but does anyone else know our routine? There is a place to record your routine.
Part two contains legal and financial information. There are certain pages that should be kept confidential. Those pages should be removed from the book or copied before filling them out and copies kept in a secure location.
"This is an all-in-one-source of personal, medical, religious, legal and financial information that can save you time and money and maybe your life."
"The Senior Organizer"by Debby S. Bitticks, Lynn Benson, and Dorothy K. Breininger is a must for everyone, not just seniors. I think filling out this is the most important thing you can do for a loved one. I was impressed that the authors even included a section for the names, address and phone numbers of friends. I intend to use this book and to purchase at least three more - one for my husband and one for each of my parents. I highly recommend this book to everyone; you never know when the need for this information may arise.
It's 3 AM in the morning. You're in the Emergency Room of some hospital, and you have a medical crisis on your hands. The admissions people and the doctors need some vital and official information. Your mind is in a panic and you struggle to find things for the inquiring people like medical insurance policy numbers, medical histories, the esoteric names and dosages of required medications, what was the normal routine of the person, the physicians, where the medical power of attorney is, etc., but your mind is a blur. What would be your lifesaver?
It's 2 PM in the afternoon. Your mind is heavy with grief. Your aging parent has died and you are sitting down with a lawyer and are trying to put together an accurate picture of your parent's estate, so that the will can be worked out. All you know is that the financial records and property information of your parent are probably scattered out in some files in some cardboard boxes somewhere. What would be your lifesaver?
It's 7 AM in the morning. Last night at the crowded restaurant someone stole your wallet with all your credit and debit cards and everything else. You want to call the credit card companies and notify them, but you have nothing written down and you can't find those old bill stubs that would have all the numbers. Your stomach is tied in knots. What would be your lifesaver?
There is such a lifesaver available, and every person with some degree of complexity to their lives should have it, or something like it. One of the very best ones that I have found is a paperback book titled 'The Senior Organizer- Personal, Medical, Legal, Financial', by Debby S. Bitticks, Lynn Benson and Dorothy K. Breininger.
At the front of this handy workbook, we're told that The Senior Organizer is 'one-stop shopping for all your vital information. No more digging through files!' There are two parts to this volume - one for personal and medical data, and the other for legal and financial information. Additional forms can be downloaded from the book's website.
Part One begins with pages for emergency contact details, insurance coverage, physicians, medications, medical history, and what to pack in an emergency overnight bag. Personal information includes contacts, memberships, health care providers, hospital stays, what to ask in medical appointments, daily routines, personal grooming, diet & nutrition, home safety, location of key items, pet care, repair and maintenance, religious customs, interests, and key dates.
Part Two has places to note legal and financial consultants, info on a financial power of attorney, family legal documents and any pending issues, bank accounts, credit cards, investments, assets, liabilities, tax information and receipts, property deeds, vehicles, valuables, insurance information, retirement benefits, a living will, and a last will and testament. There's also space for notes at the very back of the workbook.
The authors, self-styled intergenerational organizers, suggest that their workbook 'belongs in the home of every older adult' and that it 'will eliminate hours of searching for important documents'. The Senior Organizer also comes in a Deluxe 3 Volume Binder Set, which includes a CD of all the forms. I plan to use my copy to help my mother organize her affairs and recommend it to anyone in the same situation.

FAIRHOPE, Ala. — When Debby Bitticks brought her aging father to live in the home she shared with her husband, Ken, and their children, she knew very little about the challenges they would face attending to his needs. She also didn’t realize that abusing and preying upon senior citizens had become a common occurrence in this country, so she set out to help change that.
“I got a phone call several years ago that my father was ill, and I became his caregiver,” Bitticks said. “My husband and I were very naive. It was a really good experience.”
It wasn’t long after Rabbi Meier Schimmel moved in that Ken’s father, Raymond Bitticks, lost his wife, and the family hired outside help to care for him in his home. She noted, however, “We began to see changes in my father-in-law. My own father noticed changes. So we hired a private investigator, and learned he was being abused by his caregiver. We found out it’s an epidemic.”
The elder Bitticks, a devout Christian, was then brought home to live with Debby’s family, where both he and Schimmel urged their son and daughter to get involved in educating people about the dangers faced by an aging population.
According to the National Center for Victims of Crime, a senior citizen is abused every 2.7 minutes. For Debby Bitticks, whose father joined the U.S. Army after arriving from Germany, where he had escaped the Holocaust, that was unacceptable.
“These two men begged us to go out and tell people what is going on,” Bitticks said. The couple did so by producing an informative DVD, “Saving Our Parents,” hosted by award-winning actor Ed Asner, with commentary by Art Linkletter, Michael Reagan, Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton, Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen and a host of others.
Among the topics covered are knowing how to spot crooked conservators, choosing a nurturing nursing home for your aging loved ones, the potential pitfalls of nursing home care, multiple generations living together harmoniously, hired caregiver crimes and how to prevent them, information about the role of a geriatric care manager, signs of abuse, neglect or illness that your parents might not mention and telemarketing and other scams.
Bitticks said, “One of the segments is about nursing homes, and one of the most important things ever is to go in unannounced on a regular basis.”
She noted not all nursing homes are bad, but those that are simply trying to turn an easy profit often reduce labor costs by attending to residents less than they should, including failing to turn them until bedsores have created infections that pass into their bones.
“They die a terrible death,” Bitticks said. “Often when they’re ill, they will not take them to the hospital. Even if you have to pay someone to go in for you, it’s so worth it to check on a loved one.”
Although Debby and Ken were able to care for their parents at home, they hired help to look after them while they worked. Even though under their roof, the couple guarded them ferociously.
“You do not know who you’re letting into your house,” she said. “There are (bad) people that advertise and call looking for work.”
Bitticks continued, saying, “There are well-organized crime groups who do nothing but go after elderly people,” Bitticks said. “They begin treating them like a friend on the phone, and they don’t realize they’re being taken.” Such criminals are often trained to enter the eldercare field and know how to spot dementia.
Others even approach seniors in shopping center parking lots and offer to help load groceries, then follow them home and ease into their lives.
Bitticks advises children of aging parents to watch their incoming and outgoing mail, as well as their caller I.D. in order to prevent scams. She said, “The more we can get the Baby Boomers to be aware of this, the more they can set up a system to remind their parents and grandparents.”
Sid Kirchheimer, an AARP advisor, writes, “People over age 60 make up only one-eighth of the U.S. population, yet they constitute one of every three scam victims.” Telephone ploys, identity theft, get-rich-quick schemes, sweepstakes prizes — today’s hucksters have a wide-ranging repertoire of tricks in their bag.
Asner stated, “Everyone needs to be more aware of elder abuse and take steps to protect themselves and their loved ones. ‘Saving Our Parents’ is a must-see documentary.”
The DVD was produced and directed by Emmy winner Jeff MacIntyre. Its mission is to protect the aging population of the country and help adult children care for their parents. Interviewees tell shocking stories of families deceived by predators and offer lifesaving information from the country’s most trusted experts on the topic.
World Elder Abuse Awareness Day coincided with Father’s Day on Sunday. The advocate couple’s fathers didn’t live to see their dream fully become a reality with the April release of the DVD. Schimmel died in 2005. Bitticks passed away the following year.
"We have to take a deep breath and think about what we want when we’re old," Bitticks said. "Even if you don’t have a great relationship with your parents, look at it as the moral or right thing to do."
A new DVD called “Saving Our Parents” provides important information regarding the pitfalls and predators facing our aging American population and their families. While this presentation is in no way “preachy,” it astutely and fairly addresses the reality that, left unattended by family members and friends, today’s elderly population is ripe for exploitation and victimization by a host of predators.
To get a sense of the magnitude and dollars involved, think about these “Saving Our Parents” concepts and statistics:
At Estate of Denial (www.EstateofDenial.com) we focus on Involuntary Redistribution of Assets (IRA) cases that revolve around looting assets of the dead and disabled through probate actions and/or instruments such as wills, trusts and guardianships. Our concentration is to address IRA as a property rights issue affecting a cross-section of Americans while recognizing the elder abuse components of the issue. Having said that, “Saving Our Parents” does a great job describing common lead-ups to IRA looting scenarios. The DVD aptly explains that there is no shortage of predators who view the elderly as a license to steal.
Chayo Reyes, an LAPD Specialist in Elder Fraud (ret.), describes today’s older population as “the Greatest Generation - the Greatest Generation to exploit.” This DVD puts forth a message that Americans of all ages need to hear - from detailing how elders can be duped into signing over assets to financial predators disguised as caregivers or even love interests - after all, nothing warms a heart like cold cash in the bank! - to more nefarious “walker stalkers” who may gain control of an elderly person’s life and property by physical/psychological manipulation or even more stringent means such as poison.
We don’t want to give away the entire DVD as we want people to watch it! “Saving Our Parents” does a great job warning of potential nursing home neglect, hoarding disorders and other situations that can occur as an individual ages. The actions offered to hopefully avoid some of these scenarios are sensible as well as practical.
The true strength of this effort, however, lies in its presentation of the predatory dangers that surround America’s aging population. And to add our own editorial note: don’t think that older Americans aren’t quite capable of abusing each other. While it is easy to suppose that asset looting or property poaching is exclusively an action of younger people taking advantage of their elders — think again. “Hell may have no fury as a woman scorned,” but we maintain that a penniless aging woman (or man) can be as dangerous a beast as there is when faced with the prospect of old age and no money.
The “silent epidemic of the 21st century” is becoming a common characterization for elder abuse and it was put well in context with Elder Abuse Attorney Marc Hankin stating his belief that “half of all Americans will have suffered some form of elder abuse before they are dead.” But don’t take our word for any of this. More information on this important DVD is available at www.SavingOurParents.com.
My sisters, brother and I are all Baby Boomers and found "Saving Our Parents" one of the most useful tools to ensure the safety and happiness of our elderly mother. We were are stunned to see the realities of today's criminals and their ways of harming the elderly to gain money and valuables. We now check in on our parent at least a few times a day to ensure that no strangers are asking for donations or that a service person doesn't not show up to fix something that does not need repair. And in case we are suspicious, we now know clues to look for when something doesn't seem quite "right." Bravo to "Saving Our Parents!"
Thank goodness someone has produced this timely and incredibly enlightening documentary. It highlights what I think we all are turning a `blind-eye' to - the exploitation and victimization of our elderly citizens. I recently learned that one elderly person is victimized every 2.7 minutes! Very sad and shocking! This DVD teaches us to take an active role in the lives of our older family members. We are their first line of defense against scam-artists and crooks who prey on our elderly in their golden years. Our parents protected and watched out for us when we were young and vulnerable, and this documentary teaches us how to return the favor! Bravo to Bitticks, Breininger, Asner and other celebs. Buy this DVD, you'll be so very glad you did!
This is the best and only documentary I have ever seen that addresses all the problems you might encounter as you begin to care for an aging relative or just to educate yourself. It shares solutions to guard against senior scams and has interviews with actual victims that both touch your heart and inspire. It also has interesting footage of a family who created an intergenerational home as well as other inspirational tips from Ed Asner and the other experts and celebs.
"She's our life coach. She is about organizing. She is about an action plansetting up the interval steps to get where you're going. Setting realistic goals, doing all those things and she is good at it! "
"...encourages you to focus in on what you really wantand what's preventing you from getting there. Time Efficiency Makeover provides valuable tools for change that will result in massive action."
"I have found that a few hours of Dorothy Breininger's training is saving me hundreds of hours of my own time, while bringing me greatly increased efficiency and peace of mind."
I got this for my son, and he found the exercises and tips to be very useful. There was a noticeable improvement.
Time Efficiency Makeover is one of the most useful books I have used to conquer my own procrastination. Once you find the area that you need to work on, the book gives useful exercises on how to identify the problem area, then start working on it right away! A very practical book AND would make a very practical gift.

Celebrities & Experts Join Forces to Help Prevent Elder Abuse by Giving Tips on Finding the Best Elder Care: World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, June 15, 2008
LOS ANGELES, June 12 /PRNewswire/ -- Ed Asner, Art Linkletter, Michael Reagan, LAPD Police Chief William Bratton, L.A. Public Health Director Jonathan Fielding, Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen and a host of others join intergenerational experts Debby Bitticks and Dorothy Breininger of Delphi Health Products, Inc. in a new documentary, "Saving Our Parents" (http://www.savingourparents.com), which was released in April 2008.
Nothing could be more horrifying than learning that one of your parents or grandparents is being victimized by a predatory caregiver, crooked conservator, or neglectful nursing home. When Debby and Ken Bitticks were charged with the responsibility, like many in the "sandwich generation" today, of providing elder care for their parents, they moved both of their aging fathers into their home and hired help to care for them while they worked. Ken soon discovered that the caregiver he had hired to help his dad was abusive, dishonest and had been scamming the elderly for the last few years. They were horrified when they realized that elder abuse is a growing epidemic and were frustrated at how difficult it is to find good elder care. Unfortunately, stories of elder abuse are becoming more and more prevalent across the country, inside and outside of nursing homes.
"People over age 60 make up only one-eighth of the U.S. population, yet they constitute one of every three scam victims," says Sid Kirchheimer, an advisor to AARP. Telephone ploys, identity theft, get-rich-quick schemes, sweepstakes prizes -- today's hucksters have a wide-ranging repertoire of tricks in their bag and seniors are especially vulnerable. Being put in elder care or in a nursing home no longer guarantees a lessening of this trend and can actually increase an unscrupulous person's ability to scam the elderly.
Hosted and narrated by Emmy & Golden Globe winner Ed Asner, and produced and directed by Emmy winner Jeff MacIntyre, the mission of the Saving Our Parents DVD is to protect the aging population of the country and help adult children care for their aging parents as well as find the right type of elder care for their needs. Interviewees tell shocking stories of families deceived by predators who scammed their elderly family members and offer life-saving information from the country's most trusted experts on the intricate world of elder care. Segments include:

William Bratton, chief of the Los Angeles Police Department advises people to stay involved with the seniors in their lives and ask specific questions. “Engage them in the details of how they’re feeling,” he says. “Ask, ‘Who did you hear from today?’ and ‘What's going on?’"
Bratton says that crooks often try to elicit credit card or bank information over the phone. So he advises people to be on alert if a caller says, “You must act now or the offer won't be any good,” or claims you've won something but have to pay for postage, handling or other charges. Use these self-defense strategies:
Watch the mail pile: Monitor how many catalogs, sweepstakes mailings, vacation home offers and investment solicitations come in. Be prepared to act if you see that number increasing. (Better yet, get your relative’s name and contact information off of the marketing lists. To learn how, go to dmachoice.org.)
Keep an eye on the Caller ID log: Is there an increase in telephone calls from unfamiliar numbers? As folks age and spend more time alone, they tend to welcome a friendly voice on the phone. Crooks take advantage of that.
Monitor purchases: Is your relative’s home filling up with new purchases, particularly expensive ones? If so, someone could be hitting him with a scam in which he must make purchases for the opportunity to “win big.”
Take stock: Before you bring in any outside caregivers, inventory your loved one’s possessions and financial accounts. You both need to be aware of what valuables are in the house so they don’t disappear. You’ll also need to help your relative keep track of her money.
Be wary of isolation tactics. Forced isolation is typical predatory behavior. Be wary of a caregiver who tries to separate your loved one from the rest of the family, or restrict your contact. If you live far away and telephone conversations with your relative are difficult, consider sending someone you trust to visit regularly and inform you about the situation.
It’s illegal for companies to operate contests or sweepstakes that require payment for entry or to claim a prize. In fact, these companies are prohibited from even suggesting that your chances of winning will improve if you buy something.
It’s illegal for telemarketers to ask for an upfront fee to help a person get a loan, even if they guarantee or strongly imply that the loan will be made.
There is no reason to give your credit card number, bank account information or Social Security number to a telemarketer, even to claim an actual prize.

Tigerlily Foundation Founder (www.tigerlilyfoundation.org) Maimah Karmo says, "Not until I was diagnosed with breast cancer did I fully understand the true importance of documenting one's health history. After my diagnosis, I researched my family's health history and found no evidence of a family disposition towards breast cancer; however, I wondered whether that lack of knowledge was due to lack of documentation or was it in fact true that there was no family history. I also wondered how many women had lost their lives to this disease and others because of lack of health history documentation.
Today, as a breast cancer survivor and health advocate, who is the mother of a young daughter, I see tremendous value in creating a legacy of good health...and that starts with encouraging the recording of genetic/hereditary predispositions towards certain illnesses and diseases. We can benefit future generations by empowering them to be their best health advocate and equipping them with knowledge that can prolong and save lives".

The News Herald, NC, reports that two Morganton Girl Scouts teamed up over the last few months to bring a gift of style and warmth to local foster children. Anna Sheppard and Savannah Webb utilized their Girl Scout promise of helping others and began collecting clothing last fall to donate to Lifegains, Inc. - a private, not-for-profit child placement organization with offices across North Carolina. Sheppard and Webb collected garments suitable for kids, aged birth to 18, consisting of everything imaginable to clothe them from head to toe. The donations came from local churches, businesses and friends and family members of both girls.
As Girl Scouts in Troop 10463, Sheppard and Webb took on the project to earn the Girl Scout Silver Award, the highest award for girls 11-14 years old. The Girl Scout Silver Award represents a girl's accomplishments in scouting and her community and helps girls explore careers, gain leadership skills and make a commitment to self-improvement.

Weekly Happenings: The first half of last week was pretty normal. On Monday we went to the library and then out for frozen yogurt afterwards. We got a treat on Thursday and Friday in that Paul had the time off work. On Thursday we headed up to Austin to go to IKEA in order to get a storage unit for my music. It’s basically a long, skinny bookcase that we set on its side and then slid boxes into for storage. Paul has plans to buy some wood to attach to the top to make it more like a window seat. We’ll probably also put a removeable cushion on top (so that when Christmas time comes we can remove it and put the Christmas tree on top) to make it more comfy. We also stopped and ate at a restaurant called Green Mesquite (it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives). It was pretty good BBQ. Friday, we mainly hung around the house because we knew Saturday would be a crazy day (with it being 4th of July). Saturday we went to Market Day in Old Town Helotes, went out for lunch, came home to relax a bit, and then headed to the ward Independence Day party. The Sunday School Presidency was partly in charge of organizing it, so Paul was pretty busy during the party making sure things were running smoothly. It was a really fun party. There were a ton of water games (we knew it would be like that, so we put Joseph in his swim clothes ahead of time), a yummy dinner and dessert, and to top it all off, all the kids got to bring home something (Joseph chose a long water “launcher”). On the way home from the party we stopped by a fireworks stand and picked up some firecrackers to light off once it got darker. It was quite the sight in our neighborhood last night. I’ll post a video that I got of the “show” (there’s seriously no reason to pay to go to a fireworks show when you live outside of city limits). We all got to bed pretty late which made for a sleepy morning at church this morning, but that’s nothing a good night’s sleep won’t cure (unless our neighbors decide to continue the celebration tonight). 😉
The Weekly Weather: It was rather unstable this past week. There were several times that Joseph and I were caught unaware by surprise thunderstorms (luckily the storms were warm ones). This next week looks to be a bit more stable (there is actually no rain in the immediate forecast), but we know that can always change. 🙂
What Paul’s Been Up To: One fun thing that Paul got to do was go target shooting at one of the local ranges. He doesn’t get to go often, so it’s always a treat when he does get to go. Other than that, I think he enjoyed having a four-day weekend. We sure enjoyed having him home!
What Sarah’s Been Up To: Not too much out of the ordinary. I’m working on finalizing my visiting teaching report so that we can put it into the computer. Other than that, it’s just been the normal stuff.
What Joseph’s Been Up To: He was rather excited to get some new clothes this past week (due to the holiday weekend, several stores were having really good sales, so I went to get some stuff that is the next size up so that I can gradually build up my supply). Other than that, he really enjoyed having four days of having Daddy home…tomorrow may be a bit rough.
This Week in Pictures (we neglected to get any pictures at the ward party; mainly because Joseph was never in the same place for long):
Playing with the puppets in the children’s section of the library. They must have a time where they do puppet shows, but I haven’t looked up the information.
I walked upstairs and found this: apparently the T-Rex was a bit hungry and felt the need to take a bite out of the garage. 🙂
In case anyone is wondering what summer in South Texas is like, here you go…isn’t that humidity just divine?!
Here’s the beginnings of my music storage. Joseph somehow got it into his mind as Paul was putting it together that it was going to be a place to put shoes. I have no idea why…I also have no idea why he was incredibly disappointed when we told him it wasn’t going to be (to the point of almost being in tears). He perked up when we told him that we were going to make it into another “cozy corner” (which is what he calls the nook by the stairs and under the bookshelves where we have some of his books as well as a pillow and a soft rug and blanket…it is a rather cozy corner).
He had to try on his new sweatshirt (since it is designed like one of his current favorite shows: LEGO Ninjago). It’s a little big for him (and he for sure doesn’t need a sweatshirt right now with the current weather), but he wore it around for a good part of the afternoon after we got it, pretending to be a ninja. 🙂
Joseph had Paul build him a fort out of Lincoln Logs so that he had a place for his Army guys to hang out.
Waiting for the fireworks to start. Before anyone thinks that we’re being overprotective about proper hearing protection, just stop and think about how loud mortar-based fireworks can be…going off just a few houses down. Yeah…
Playing with sparklers. He was moving it a bit, which is why the sparkling part looks so big. Paul had him holding it with a pair of pliers just to put a bit more distance between his hand and the sparks. 🙂
As you can see, it was pretty awesome…and that was only roughly two minutes worth. It went on for quite some time.
Essentially, it spares their self-esteem. As I said at the with of the article, the feedback with make you with your advertisement for yourself If how you talk, look, rejection ask for a date is just an "advertisement", then dating is an easy and impersonal fix. If, however, it is dating a single father tips core aspect of you as a person, then it is dealing "personal" and hard to change.
So, overall, I suggest the dating as a bit of "cognitive restructuring" because it rejection people see rejection as less personal and leaves them better able to incorporate feedback. With a more "personal" view with rejection, many people end up feeling hurt, bitter, angry, or resentful and not changing for the better. So, Rejection provide a possible point of view that alleviates those negative feelings dealing issues: Having said that, there are others dating choose to take rejection more personally and endure the hard feelings, with good reason you may be one.
Particularly, the rejection responsibility you take for an outcome, the more motivated and able you can be to adapt to reach that desired outcome. In dating words, if dealing believe others reactions are entirely under your control, then you will eventually have more control over them than someone who dealing take such personal responsibility.
But, with a perspective with only possible and functional for individuals who have a certain set of personality characteristics - the kind of people dating "thrive on a challenge".
Otherwise, such a view of extreme personal rejection leads to hurt feelings, frustration, inaction, and bitterness noted dealing. I hope that with to rejection the thought behind my advice. Given that, it still might not work for your personal worldview That is one of the challenges of providing "general" dating advice, there are always exceptions. Dealing any event, please stay reading and I'll get to something that fits for your approach!
Until then, thanks for the feedback and please dating doing what dating for you. I'm really glad I found your article. I've been experiencing exactly what you describe: It's a common dating for me dating things don't work rejection. In my dealing case, someone I dated 5x recently "disappeared" after he visited the site of his called-off wedding--he went there to join his parents who'd bought non-refundable matchmaking china with the destination.
I suspected it top married hookup sites be difficult and he'd with making noises that he wasn't really so available as we got more into dating, and that he needed time dealing himself. So the reason seems clear.
But I still feel rejected largely because dating sites for kenya simply dealing get in dating despite our plans to get dealing for my dating This neglect has left me feeling un-worthwhile for weeks now.
I'm working on my self-esteem to build myself up and feel better but it's with difficult and requires frequent self-talk. I feel like I need to read your article and anything else I can find over and over again. Weekly therapist and nice friends don't help all the way. Thanks for dating websites for wealthy helpful article.
I know intellectually that it's the key with if I only introduce yourself dating profile experience it as a truth emotionally. Thanks reading this article has truly been a helping hand I completely understand it now. Personalizing the rejection made the heartache ten times harder. Rejection, I had a great 24 hour online life coach dealing taught me the mac hookup to projector of not taking it personally I really can recommend Your24hCoach.
I was withholding my own self-love from myself by being consistently hard on myself. Dating, I totally understood how hard it was for my ex to be around a person who was not happy with herself. In my opinion talking about the problem and an adequate life assistance through experts has a great impact on your confidence.
Through does tips you dating got the confidence you need to transmit the theory explained in this article into real action and proof in daily life! Good luck to everyone! Dealing analogy you use of "advertisement" and "product" puts the notion of rejection into dating very well.
Understanding this and thinking this way will allow rejection to improve and better their with once the individual sees that the "product", aka your personality, is not with on the "advertising", you'll roll with the punches, laugh and enjoy your time with others more.
Greetings, I have dealing this article and many more on this site. Can you rejection post a link to part 2 of this with I still feel bad for rejecting a boy who asked me out when I was 14 - I'm now 44 and I often think of him because dealing was my first kiss.
I was so shy and nervous that when rejection phoned me to arrange a date I dealing and said I had to visit my rejection. He wasn't my first love and I only met him at a dance. We danced, he dealing me and I gave him my phone number. He called the next day to rejection me out and I made up an excuse.
Dating always felt bad making up an excuse. Strange how all these years later I still think of that and how it must of hurt him at the time.
Dealing article tries to be very tender-hearted and optimistic with people who have been rejected, but a romantic rejection is often an 'informed', personal rejection -- most of the times I've ever turned down an offer, it was definitely because I didn't want to have that experience with that specific person but would have been quite open to the same offer from many other peopleand when offers I dealing made rejection been turned down, it has been obvious that it was mainly personal about me and specifically due to whatever it was that they dating interested in about me.
I went out on a long date with someone and it dating great, then at the end of the evening he asked me for a second date rejection following weekend, I accepted, he said he would call me rejection arrange it, and then I never heard from him again. He had my phone number and email address, plus we had acquaintances in common, so it's not that he didn't have a way of contacting with.
He just did not seem with the kind of flaky person who would do that, so after the second weekend of not hearing from him came and went, I sent him a polite message asking him if he could explain what had happened, because it had seemed like he was so enthusiastic for a second date.
He actually telephoned me at work, so it was tricky having the with because I was working in an open-plan setting and said that the day after our date, he had been rejection with friends and dating met a woman he simply with a lot better than he liked me, and she was single, and she liked him too, so he decided he didn't want to go on a second date with me, and he had figured that it was less unkind to simply disappear, rather than contact me specifically to dealing the upcoming date.
I said, "How did you rejection you liked her dating better than you liked me rejection you barely knew me, and you had just met her? Rejection, they just weren't interested enough in you.
But it's unlikely that you will change their mind, so be polite, good-humored, and dealing if with are turned down, and move on to try to get to know other people.

As a result, many newcomers to the field of coin collecting rely solely on the grade to direct their buying decisions, never realizing there are so many other aspects to a coin’s value and appeal until they try to sell.
Truth be told, the best way to build a truly exceptional collection, one that immediately distinguishes itself to any viewer that it has been painstakingly selected rather than simply accumulated, is to understand these matters of esoterica and apply them to your collecting habits. One of the most misunderstood and greatly overlooked aspects of a coin’s eye appeal is the strike.
Now if you are a collector of the classical designs of the early 20th century, i.e. Buffalo nickels, Mercury dimes, Standing Liberty quarters and Walking Liberty halves, then you probably have a grasp on this concept already. These coin series are noted for their artistry in the presentation of their subject matter, but are also notorious for the inconsistency of the design strike. The high relief of the designs, the hardness of the metal (in the case of nickel), and the economic considerations of the Depression era mints all contributed to this high variability in strike. Thus, many of the coins of this era look “mushy” and worn though they may still be in uncirculated condition with no real wear from handling.
However, when you wean yourself from chasing just the number on the coin holder and understand that every MS63 isn’t just like every other MS63, with a little perseverance you can find coins in these series that truly stand out! In the case of Buffalo nickels you may be familiar with the Full Horn designation, referring to the fact that this feature is not always present and so differentiates a typical Buffalo nickel from one with an exceptional strike. Mercury dimes have the Full Bands designation, Standing Liberty quarters use Full Head, etc.
But why stop there? These aren’t the only details on these particular designs that didn’t strike up well. Regarding the quarter, what about the rivets on Liberty’s shield or the line of drapery on her right leg? Shouldn’t the Buffalo nickel display the Indian’s braid and hair to its fullest extent, or the line of fur on the buffalo’s left shoulder? These are points that separate the collector from the accumulator. These are things that make the hunt so much more enjoyable. And not all dealers take these matters into consideration. They’re just chasing the numbers. Take advantage of this and see the difference for yourself!
Strike is definitely one of the variables in coin selection. I collect Walking Liberty halves. Their strike varies greatly from one year to the next and even from one mint to the next. Finding well struck coins for the collection can be really challenging sometimes. Great article.
I have been building a collection of mint state Liberty Nickels and pursuing only coins with fully struck details. Even though it is challenging to find the coins, I usually pay about the same as coins with weak strikes and incomplete details. I enjoy the pursuit and feel that I will have a superior collection in the end.

One of the biggest features missing from Taveo was advanced redirects. This term can be a bit confusing, so internally we like to call them rule-based destinations. Others call them dynamic destinations. Basically it means that the URL you click on has a different destination page based on some criteria. For example, you can use dynamic destination links to send Android and Iphone users to different sites. Using Taveo’s dynamic destinations you could now tweet out a single URL. Taveo automatically sends iOS users to your Apple App store page and Android users to your google play store page. This is just scratching the surface of all the fun stuff you can do with these links. Furthermore, they are incredibly useful to bloggers, marketers, developers, etc.
We are happy to announce that as of today Taveo’s link tracking platform supports advanced redirects!
We have setup a demo link to showcase this technology. When you click on the button below you will be sent to your Operating Systems home page. Try clicking this link on different devices and watch what happens!
Finally, this update required quite a bit of effort to accomplish and mandated a major overhaul of our back-end systems. It was a large effort, but it we are really exciting to see them available to all of our users (even the Free accounts!) To get started with our advanced redirects, sign up for Taveo.
Recently I have been struggling with how to easily and accurately describe what Taveo is and what it does. Initially, I was very focused on explaining to people what link analytics and click tracking were and how we fit within that space. Some understood right away, others kind of gave me a blank stare..(link what!?). I hesitated to say “Taveo is a url shortener” or “Taveo is a click tracking service”, because to be honest we’re much more than those two things. Besides, the world doesn’t exactly need another url shortening service (bit.ly and goo.gl have that covered pretty well). The answer to the question is we are both (and more!).
Once we are actually up and running (Public beta coming in Jan 2015!) Taveo will function as perfectly capable url shortening service. We have a registered a few nice, short domains (including tav.so and zo.gd) for our users to use if they wish. After logging in to our service you will be 3-4 clicks away from your very own short url (ex. http://tav.so/ZQrTy). You can never log in again and your short url will continue on functioning forever.
The interesting part come if you decided to come back and login again. You will be greeted with detailed information about who actually clicked on your link. You can view real-time statistics (aka live view) that give you time, ip address, geo location, type (robot, mobile, desktop) and referrer. On the statistics page you can get a more aggregate view of your data, including charts of clicks over time and a breakdown of clicks by type. If you’re using Taveo to track your Google Adsense or Bing Ads advertisements, you will also see the query that the user performed to find your site!
During development, I’ve been using Taveo to track a few Ad Sense advertisements I have for another project (Beta Tester #1 right here). The live view has been extremely helpful in tuning my campaign. After just 24 hours and ~200 clicks I’ve learned the following very useful tidbits of information:
I found out that google was serving my ads for a phrase that was nowhere near what I was advertising (the order of the words was backwards and meant 2 completely different things)
StumbleUpon advertising seems to generate 4 clicks on a link for each user (no idea why, was consistently happening)
Ad Sense doesn’t trust me very much; There are lots of random clicks from all over the world with the exact same super outdated browser. My theory is that this is google safe browsing or something similar.
Don’t forget that Taveo Beta starts soon! Add your e-mail to the form on the right side and we will notify you when Beta has started.
The inspiration for this post came from many areas. But after finding out that Tim Sykes was working with some third world school building charities, I thought I’d highlight these projects. My interest comes from many areas considering these projects touch on so many of my core passions. Trading, construction, charity, youth and education.
Before going into the coverage of these projects and my involvement, keep in mind I did a full very detailed review of the trading education product that was used to fund both of these projects. Tim Sykes came out with “How to Make Millions” trading course and if you are interested click this link for tons of info. With this introduction to stock trading course Sykes has raised over $1,500,000 to date, all of being allocated to charity.
First off Sykes has a long involvement in charity projects going back to his college days at Tulane, considering he was funding scholarships from his dorm room I was not that surprised when I saw on my social feed that he had decided to allocate some of the proceeds from his charity DVD towards constructing third world schools. I have long been a follower of Pencils of Promise and Adam Braun, though I have never pulled the trigger on getting involved I have great respect for what these charities are accomplishing.
Great thing is now through my relationship with Tim Sykes I will be able to help in a REAL way with these projects vs just sending a check. After complimenting Tim on his large donations to these charities I almost jokingly asked if I could go on a site visit with him and potentially actually swing a hammer or help in some other actual boots on the ground way. Tim quickly replied and said “Sure come along this fall and spring to visit Laos and Cambodia and we will see what you can do.” While I am unsure how much help I will be allowed to give, just having the opportunity to help out on a project like this in a physical way is very exciting to me. Not to mention just having the opportunity to visit and see the children and communities is greatly inspiring to me!
There is no doubt Tim Sykes is an “aggressive internet marketer” but it is 2016 and my social feed is full of guys selling products online, and I purchase many of them. But I have not seen any of these others create a product where 100% of the proceeds go to charity. And if they have I’m confident none of them have contributed close to $200,000 to make some of the poorest and neglected areas of the world better.
Its cliche but children are our future, and thanks to the internet, children anywhere in the world have a legitimate chance to the the next Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. IF and only IF they are given an education. Everybody likes to bitch on social media about what a fucked up world we live in, but $200,000 spent in a third world country to help 100’s or maybe 1000’s of children is a very real and substantial way to change the future.
Altering your profile picture or pissing and moaning on social media won’t do a damn bit of good in the end. While in the grand scheme of things its a small project Tim Sykes is making real change in the world. And something like building schools is a force multiplier. The potential for good to come out of these and future products is beyond exciting to me. And I thank Tim for the opportunity to help and can’t wait to visit and work on these projects!
Electronic cigarette smoking has not completely replaced traditional smoking but it surely is on its way to do so.
An electronic cigarette also known as a PV (Personal Vaporizer) is an electronic inhaler that vaporizes a liquid solution. The device does not involve any smoke and it therefore brings up the debate of second hand smoke.
E-cigarettes are rapidly becoming one of the most demanding products on the market in the U.S. More and more companies are investing in this industry as many people are opting for E-cigarettes. One of the major benefits that companies are claiming is that you can smoke almost anywhere as e-cigarettes do not emit smoke, they produce a vapor.
Electronic cigarette companies are booming and the business has been able to capture ten percent to fourteen percent of the smoking industry.
E-cigarettes come in many different and attractive designs making them more compelling to the end user. Also many celebrities today are opting for e-cigarettes bringing even more attention to the product. After seeing the popularity of e-cigarettes many well-renowned tobacco companies are planning to enter the business and their advantage over other e-cig companies is yet to be determined.
So it seems that the business as well as the competition is going to increase in this industry. However staying at the forefront of the market is the The eCiggy, providing their customers with some of the best service and quality e-cigs on the market.

Experiencing times of stress and worry is all part of being a business owner. Sometimes, it's caused by having low cash flow, finding yourself short staffed or other unexpected changes ...
Luckily, in times where you do find yourself with more work than staff, or a team member is in need of a fair amount of time off, we now have the luxury of hiring temporary employees to bridge the gap while you get back on your feet.
This means you can increase the help available for particular projects or bringing in a specialised set of skills. However, these come at a cost, one much higher than a permanent and contracted employee.
On top of the high agency fees, the temporary employee often charges a very high hourly rate to compensate for the lack of benefits and security they receive whilst in short-term work.
Another (and often cheaper) option that you have when looking for short-term cover, is to outsource certain tasks or business operations. Outsourcing work boasts the luxury of not having to fill a seat in the office (and pay for numerous cups of tea and biscuits) and also means that you're only paying for the hours that are worked.
Often with temporary employees, you end up with them occupying your office for a full day, when they may only have a few hours worth of tasks to get done!
Whilst you don't need to pay temporary staff for sick days or holiday days, it can still be an inconvenience when they need time off. Using an outsourcing service immediately eliminates this worry as outsourcing to a team of experts ensures that there will always be someone there to get the work done.
Another benefit of outsourcing temporary work as opposed to bringing staff in-house is that you immediately eliminate the process of settling a new worker into your team and avoid any conflicts that may potentially arise. Also, once you find an outsourcing service that you are happy with, you are able to use them again and again. It would be rare to find a temporary employee that would be available each time you require their help.

This song is a gem of a reminder that Ian is still writing and playing fantastically good rock 'n' roll. The entire album (and for that matter, his later solo catalog starting with Rant in 2001) is incredible. And a crazy-good band! The 2012 release, When I'm President, is just as timely, fun and powerful as anything he's done before. I love this guy!.....Thanks, Sal.
Unfortunately, to my shame, it is the latter. What a great song and totally relatable to any one in a relationship.
It's good, but after two minutes I was wondering how I was going to make the whole five. After the solo I got tired of hearing about his big mouth. "Marionette" it ain't.
One of my favorite Ian songs. His solo career is worth taking a week, and listening to every album. Some albums are spotty, but there are gems on each one. I`m particularly fond of "The Artful Dodger", although Don Valentine and I disagree amiably about a couple of tunes. The man is still going strong well into his `70`s, still got the goods.

Here in San Francisco it's rainy for the first time in months which is really great! Everybody was waiting for that! We need water in California! :)
For me a rainy Sunday means: late breakfast, homemade chocolate cake, hot chocolate, blankets, cozy between pillows, magazine, nap, family time, walk to the beach with my perfect rain boots...
Have you heard about the French Rain boots Aigle?? I absolutely love them and it reminds me always my family and my childhood.
This brand is super old, they produced their first boots in 1853! They are based in Chatellerault in France which is not too far from Tours where I spent my childhood, that's why we went sometimes directly to the firm to buy some of their boots. Anyways... this brand is super famous in France, like the Hunter in USA, but they have "ce je ne sais quoi" that make them really special. :)
My mother bring us a pair for each of us! But you can order them online on Amazon or other online shops.
I love the basic design in the collection of the Malouine. So Leon has two pairs of yellow (one is for sale see below), I have the red and the Marine Blue and my husband has the blue too!
My mom bought for my son a pair of yellow boots like above but they are too small for him. I sell them new $40 with label. Size 26 EU, Size 9 US. Email me if interested sandra @ happymorningblog.com

Many of my readers may wish to know how I use my foldable kayak. Well, I don't cross the oceans with it... rather I use it as a platform for water bird photography, for day trips on lakes, and on rivers. I usually have the boat with me when I do my extensive summer trips. To give you an idea of how the boat is used, here is an example of a trip down a small stream that feeds the Malleco lake, followed by a crossing of the lake, and a hike to the lake's surprising end.
This is the rather untidy interior of my car. The big wooden box is my secret weapon to transform the car into a highly versatile 4WD camping vehicle. The box, custom-made for this car and tailored to make best use of its inner shape, has three compartments: The left side one is loaded from above, and employed to store food and cooking utensils. The front compartment, right behind the driver's seat, is front-loaded and holds all sorts of technical equipment: From mud chains to photo gear, from an air compressor destined to inflate tires to a rechargeable fluorescent lamp and its 12V charger. The top of the box is a flat table, on which I can cook and eat; the table has a 2cm high border, which will contain any liquids eventually spilled. And the bigger of the three compartments, shown open in this photo, stores the boat.
The right side of the car is held free, so that it serves as a bed. With an air mattress and a geese dawn sleeping bag, it is very comfortable. The car is equipped with HF and VHF radio transceivers, GPS, and even a hot shower! But that's material for another story...
The untidy look comes from several dozen empty plastic bags. They serve to hold food, trash, to separate items of clothing from technical stuff, and also as cushions to hold everything in place inside the box during travel, avoiding any rattling sounds. Plastic bags are truly a great invention! :-)
I drove as close to the river as I could get. There I unpacked the boat, carried it in its bag to a place in the shadow near the river, and assembled it. As many people have asked me how the assembly process is done, this time I made a sequence of photos, that will show it.
The disassembled boat is a compact package measuring 120cm length, 35cm width and 25cm height. It stores in a simple blue fabric bag, shown open here. The shiny blue bag on top holds the boat skin and the two safety floats. The green plastic sheet is not a part of the boat, but simply used as a clean surface to assemble the boat on, in order to avoid getting abrasive sand and dirt between the skin and the structure.
While driving to the river, I picked up a Korean traveler who was sweatily walking up the mountain, carrying a very heavy backpack. He camped next to the place I picked, and served as good company during the ground-based parts of this trip. Here he poses with the disassembled boat, wondering how it will look once assembled. The green plastic has been taken away, and the bag with the boat skin put on the side, so that you can see the compact arrangement of the wooden parts in the package. The inverted boat's floor serves as base for the stack; the two groups of eight runners, tied together by covernyl strips, fill the space between the floor's carriers. This forms an almost perfectly compact assembly. The two stevens with the front and aft sections of the runners attached go on top of that, not as neatly packaged but still compact enough. The ribs go on top of that, the disassembled paddle crowns the stack, with the seat cushion and the back rest leveling the package. The remaining long parts, which are the three keel sections, the cockpit liners and the paddle center section, are used to fill voids in the sides of the stack, and then everything is bound together with two ropes. The bag with the wing nuts is loosely thrown between the ribs.
By the way, the paddle center section is now of aluminum. I made this change after breaking the fully wooden paddle for the second time!
These are the two halves of the structure. They are assembled to this extent before inserting them into the skin. The blue bags are the two safety floats, which should keep the boat and any contents at the surface in the event of an accident. Fortunately, so far no such accident has ever happened, and I trust my boat so much that I cross lakes carrying my full reflex photography equipment! Still, the floats may some day safe my life, or at least some of the things I carry in the boat. And they weren't expensive: I used scraps of the same material I made the boat skin from, glued them into properly sized bags, and installed bicycle tire valves. The valve inserts are removed to inflate the bags by lung power. The bags are airtight enough to hold pressure for weeks. I normally inflate them just to a very moderate filling, so that they won't build up too much pressure when hot.
This view was arranged just for the photo. It shows how the two halves will mate. The keel center section, middle rib, the floor, cockpit sides and back rest are installed after putting these halves into the skin. The floats were removed to allow full view of the structure.
The different pieces of the boat are numbered, so that it's easy and quick to find out which piece goes where. Furthermore, the runner sections cannot get mixed up, because the front and aft pieces stay attached to the stevens at all times, while the two groups of center sections are bound together by strips of boat skin material, which also is the only thing correctly spacing the runners - just the uppermost ones, and the keel, are joined to the ribs. In this photo, the rear half of the boat allows you to see one of these strips, 2cm in front of the rib. It is tightly stretched. The strength of the material allows to screw it down onto the wood without danger of ripping it open. The front section strip is hidden by the rib.
The structure has been inserted into the skin. The runners still overlap each other by about 10cm, so that the boat skin is loose and wrinkly. It's important to properly align the skin with the structure; if this is not done carefully, the skin will be overstretched in some areas while remaining loose in others.
The second half of the structure barely fits through the opening in the skin, but with proper care it can be inserted without submitting anything to any significant force. On the other hand, bending the longer runners a little bit makes insertion easier, and is perfectly tolerated by the wood.
This is the big trick in most foldable boats: The stretching lever. This piece is engaged to the front and aft keel sections and then pushed down. By gently putting a part of one's weight on the lever, it will separate the structure halves and apply a huge stretching force to the skin. Despite the strength of the skin, the lower part of it (the one in contact with the water) is stretched by 2%, making it feel as hard as an inflated tire. In fact, people often ask me if this boat has inflatable walls! Thanks to the good stretching, which causes flat, hard surfaces, the boat glides very well through the water and can be paddled fast, with little effort. Such kayaks are among the most efficient boats in existence.
Once the keel is pushed down, it's locked in place with small aluminum flaps secured by wing nuts. Then the runners are joined; when necessary, I use a simple stretching tool, built much like the keel center section, to stretch the upper section of the boat in order to be able to effortlessly join the runners.
Then the middle rib is installed, the side pieces of the cockpit are inserted into their skin flaps, and bolted to the ribs #2, 3 and 4. These pieces do not have any stretching mechanism, so that the boat skin on the top of the sides remains loose and wrinkly. It may not look ideal, but does absolutely no damage
The last parts to be fitted are the floor, partly visible in this picture, the seat cushion and the back rest. After joining the three parts of the paddle, and attaching a small rope which is useful to guide the boat while wading in shallow water before getting in, the boat is ready for use.
Depending on the kind of trip, more or less cargo is stowed below the front and rear decks. This can include food, clothing, tent, sleeping bag, photo gear, radio gear (XQ2FOD maritime mobile!), and other odd things. Usually I use the back cargo area for those things I will need only when stopping, such as the sleeping bag, while the front area is used for things that may be needed during travel, above all the photo gear, but also the radio, some food and drink, and so on. I also always bring along a towel. When getting into the boat, I usually have to do it from the water, so that my legs are dripping, and I hate having any water in the boat! So I place the towel over the boat floor before getting in. Later, the towel can be a useful sun shade over my legs, which otherwise tend to change color into alarmingly red tones...
One of the nice things of a boat like this is that it can go where few others can. With me and some cargo inside, the boat needs little more than 10cm of water depth to stay free. It was mid summer, and the river was very low, so much so that in some places it was not even 10cm deep, and I had to get out and wade while letting the boat float free. Without me, 3cm of water are enough to make the boat float, and even water jumping over some rocks can carry the boat over them!
The paddle was very carefully impregnated and varnished, so that it holds up even after hitting the ground many times. In fact, often I use the paddle more like a pushrod than a paddle, when traveling waters as shallow!
This idyllic view was photographed during the first rest along the river. I had just carried the boat over a place where the river went underground... But from here on, I could stay in the boat until reaching open waters.
In the marshes, where the river opens into the lake, I found my Korean friend, who had hiked and waded there and was enjoying the sunshine. I also rested a while on this firmer ground, after being surprised by quicksand a little before. Quicksand is nasty stuff: It's firm enough to hold a boat captive if it runs aground, but not firm enough to allow the traveler to step out of the boat and pull it off! So one has to stay inside, and rock the boat until the sand gives way and the boat floats again.
For the next three days I explored the lake. A few times I went into deep waters, but most of the time I stayed close to the shore, as there is more to see in such places.
The reeds are an ecosystem with many small wonders to discover. For example, this abandoned dragonfly skin. Insects have rigid skins instead of an internal skeleton, and their skin cannot really grow. So when the insects grow, they form a new skin inside the old one, and one day they crack open the old skin, slip out of it, and quickly expand before the new skin hardens in contact with the air. The old skin was left parked on this reed, when its owner flew away, clad in a new outfit. And days later came this crazy kayak-based photographer and shot a picture...
Reeds are a good parking place for a kayak. It's easy to slip in and out, and while one is in them, they will keep the boat reasonably anchored. When I get hungry during a trip, and there is no landable shore nearby, I often park the boat in the reeds while eating.
By the way, staying at a fixed place in the reeds for longer than a few minutes is almost a guarantee to see some more wildlife. The reeds are full of all kinds of insects, birds, and other animals. I can stay there for hours and just watch.
This kind of duck is very common on Chilean lakes. Along with other ducks, assorted wild geese, several kinds of cormorants, black-necked swans and a few other birds, they are the crowd of the lake's feathered population.
The boat allows to silently and smoothly come close to them. Unfortunately these birds already had learned that some humans are dangerous, and didn't let me come closer than this, as soon as I moved to make a photo. On other lakes, harder to reach, I have found birds to be more trusting.
Towards the end of the lake, the terrain is lower and the forest is a little less dense. The forest at the shore is typical Chilean evergreen temperate rain forest, while further up on the rocky mountain the conditions are suitable only for specialist trees, like the characteristic Araucaria trees growing far up on the crest, defending their foothold against storm, snow and time.
Evening is a good time for photography, and so I spent several evenings out there, looking for lightings like this one. Noontime, with its bluish light and burning sun, was mostly spent lying under some tree and reading.
At the end of the lake there was this place. Like usual, the draft was noticeable even outside this bay, but in here it got quite strong. Very soon it developed into a fast flowing river. Note how the trees in the background seem to be below the water! Obviously the terrain there takes a sharp drop.
It's always a good precaution not to get too close to such a place. I stored the camera and very slowly went closer, until the noise told me that there was either a rapid, or something more. So I went back, parked the boat and went ashore, to explore the area.
You can lure children with sweets, and you can lure photographers with light! The setting sun gave a great illumination through the slightly misty air, so I ended up climbing the forested hill rather than checking out the outflow of the lake. After shooting some evening photos, I had to return in what soon became almost complete darkness. I found back to the boat, but just barely, and crossed the lake, again, but this time in the faint light provided by the stars.
The next day, I did my exploratory trip to the "rapids". And this is what I found! It's the little-known Malleco waterfall. I think it was a good idea to stop the boat before being sucked over the ridge and down into this hole! When boating down a river, such care does pay, specially when the river is unknown!
I spent three days boating the Malleco. Then I went up the shallow river, the same way I came, and folded down the boat for the drive to another body of water. I used the boat on several other lakes that summer.
I made a little top. Long time readers (hugs all round!) have heard me complain incessantly about the travails of looking stylish and feeling comfortable in temperatures above 90F. Follow this link to my second post ever on exactly this topic. Living on the border between the San Francisco Bay Area and the Great Valley, temperatures this hot may show up a good six months of the year.
Around the time I started The Dashing Eccentric I started to make a few little 'cami tops'. Sleeveless, cotton or linen, with styling bringing to mind the corset covers of the Victorian and Edwardian era, my cami tops made up using little fabric and time whilst broadcasting my own personal style no matter how high the mercury climbed.
I've never been without these style essentials since. However, this spring I had to admit that this part of my wardrobe needed a serious overhaul. My remaining cami-tops were threadbare in places where an artful applique or embroidered fillip would only be appropriate in certain Vegas venues. What's more, I hankered for a more modern, sophisticated take on this garment.
Designing a wardrobe workhorse garment which one hopes to become a TNT can be a long process. First, I had to determine my criteria - what functional and stylistic characteristics would I prioritize?
I settled on sleeveless, moderate neckline/armscye, style lines/decorative possibilities hearkening back to the corset-cover inspiration, seamlines offering exacting fit around the bust and shoulders, and clean finish of interior and edges. Based on this list I decided to go with princess seams and a yoke.
I liked the idea of a yoke for three reasons. It allowed seaming which mocked the top of a corset and allowed for closer fitting through the high bust and shoulders. This seaming could be done traditionally, seam allowances turned to the inside and very subtle, or could be accented with tone-on-tone or contrasting trims. In this instance i used self made bias binding in a low-contrast print.
The third reason I chose to go with a yoke was so I could encase all of the yoke's edges and seam allowances. Above you can see that i sewed the necklines and armscyes of the yoke to a facing, then turned it inside. On the inside of the garment, I pressed up the facing's seam allowances along the bottom edge of the yoke and hand stitched it to the interior seam allowances to finish. You can see it makes for a very clean interior - comfortable as well.
Given this decision, I looked at the commercial patterns available to see if I could find one from a well-reviewed designer with similar lines. I chose Lisette's 6183 design for Butterick. The fit was nice and the pieces went together well, and the pattern includes separate pieces for A-D cup sizes - a very nice feature in any bodice. The design lines weren't so far away from my vision so as to make drafting onerous, though I did make substantial changes. I developed completely different construction methods.
For this garment I chose to use silk organza for the yoke facing. This linen is a bit sheer, so two layers of the linen would have made the yoke appear more opaque than the 'corset' area of the top. This seemed opposite of the effect I wanted of a more substantial 'corset' with flimsier 'yoke'. Since the organza didn't add any visual weight I went with that instead of the linen.
As much as I love silk organza, it is a pest to work with! Long, strong threads grabbing everything, everywhere! Fortunately my choice worked very well for the visual effect and it is nice on the skin as well. The end product was worth the effort. If I'd done all that fussing and it hadn't turned out well, I am sure you would have heard my cussing around the world!
Using bias bindings along the seamlines had more than a decorative purpose. I stitched the vertical seams wrong sides together, pressed and trimmed the seam allowances to about 1/4". I then applied the bias strips on the right side of the garment, topstitching on both edges of the bias strips, thus encasing the raw edges.
Figuring out the order of construction on this garment, and then working with the silk organza facing was certainly fiddly! However, the end effect is wonderful. I will be looking for more opportunities to use the technique for seam finishes in future. I am scheming another make of this top in black with a white with black cotton ribbon instead of the bias binding (the curves are gentle enough that it should work without the flexibility of the bias). Using the same color but with a different texture - say, satin bias on linen - would yield a subtle, luxe result.
In order to break up the neckline a bit and allow increased ventilation, I put a split in the yoke at the top center front instead of continuing buttons all the way up. I used a combination of dark grey and clear buttons from the stash. Inside, I used one at the center back of the yoke instead of a label, with a bit of the bias binding underneath clipped like a ribbon.
I put a lot of thinking, scheming, testing, and flat out futzing into developing this top - and it was worth it! I look forward to making up more of these tops in neutrals as well as one floral which is drawing my attention in this direction...and I am excited to lengthen this top into a dress as well. Making this design in a dark, clear blue with ivory polka dots in a swingy silk crepe de chine, hitting a bit below mid calf would create a dress embodying easy French chic.
How did you come to your own TNTs? Did it involve lots of planning and experimenting or did it fall into your lap? Let us know!
mrs. e--i like your camisole top very much--and i'll bet it's divine to wear! what could be better for a summer's day than cotton? your changes to lisette's design make good sense and add a unique look to the garment.--anne
Very Nice! - it's cute and the fit is Perfect! I appreciate how you describe your criteria/process for coming up with your TNT for this kind of top.
I came up with (a much simpler, lazy-sewing) TNT that I sew over and over and wear daily. It's basically a dolman-type sleeve top - except the armscye area doesn't hang way down low. It's just ONE pattern piece with a boatneck collar, all comfortably fitted to my measurements. The back and the front are the same. Super easy to knock out on my serger.
Who knows, maybe when the winter (el Nino) rains come, I'l attempt some slightly more detailed projects. Yours are certainly inspiring...!
SewTypical how wonderful to hear i've done some inspiring! You TNT sounds great - and you are encouraging me to keep thinking about something similar for myself. A top which took less fussing would be super useful, especially as i sew slowly anyways...maybe a Tina Givens style tunic?
You're giving me food for thought! Here's hoping the El Nino brings water - we need it! And great sewing weather, too!
Another meaty post with lots to chew on! Thank you for so many thought provoking ideas and directions.
You look so fresh and cool in your lovely labor-intensive top!! We are midway through a week of rain and wind. And it is perfect sewing weather, you're right!!! Plus it sounds nice when rain hits the roof.
I love your summery look with the mixture of denim, lace, and lightweight cotton! When I read what you are doing, it fills me with the desire to get back to my sewing room. Your careful and lovely finishing details on the camisole top are sort of what I try and do when it all works out right in my metalworking, to have the hidden sides be just as lovely as the visible parts. I think you get a blue ribbon on this one, with all the subtle details, particularly the buttons and the bindings (p.s. if I was your size, I would so want to steal this top... )
I have a select group of TNT patterns, and they all involved lots of effort to get to that point, multiple fittings and adjustments. I often think that had I a me-shaped dress form, at least some of the effort would be somewhat simpler, as I could probably change more than one area at a time... (Am getting together with a local friend to try making duct tape doubles of ourselves, we'll see how well that turns out...)
Gayle i am glad to hear that! And thank you for the kind comments on my person...actually i'm growing my hair out and putting it up - easier than keeping it short ;)
"lovely labor-intensive top'! Claire you have the best way with words, and you sew so well on top of it! thank you for commenting and let's do our best to encourage the rain.
Alison, hearing i'm inspiring someone to get in the studio is the best! Yes, your metalwork always looks so beautiful and complete from every angle - something about that way of doing things is so satisfying.
You know i was thinking about your TNT patterns and the process by which you developed them while coming up with this one. You've really shown me how a few designs can truly express so much when they are well thought out and speak to the style of the wearer. Thank you (big hug).
oh - so thrilling about the dress forms! i'm keeping my fingers crossed and very curious to see how it goes!
Hope you are doing well my blogging friend. You have not posted in a while. I know you are still sewing. We miss you.

i am interested in finding out what is enough. The '30 in 30 Challenge' isn't a challenge for me, it's pretty much my approach to dressing. i am interested in how ideas, people, places, animals and things that have nothing to do with fashion influence our style. i'm interested in how we express our style in ways that have nothing to do with clothes.

X-Perience is a pop band from Berlin, Germany. Their music style varies between synthpop, trance and ethnopop. The band members are Matthias Uhle (composition, keyboards), his sister Claudia Uhle (vocals until 2007) and Alexander Kaiser (lyrics, keyboards). X-Perience was founded in 1995. Their first single CD was called Circles Of Love, released on their own label. Axel Henninger, who had worked with Camouflage before, produced the track. Circles Of Love became a regional hit in Berlin, mainly through the radio station Fritz. This caught the attention of the major record label WEA, who offered the band a contract. WEA re-released Circles Of Love in 1996 on a larger scale, and this single managed to enter the German Top 100. They released a second single, A Neverending Dream. Along with the song, a video was shot, which went into heavy rotation on MTV and VIVA. A Neverending Dream became a huge hit in the end of 1996, peaked at #4 in the German charts and reached Gold status (sold over 250.000 copies). The song has been covered several times since, lately quite successfully by Dance act Cascada. The debut album Magic Fields was released in 1997. It peaked at chart position #22 in Germany. In Finland, X-Perience became especially popular, with the album reaching Platinum. The title track Magic Fields was released as a third single, along with a video that was shot in South Africa. Although the song didn't reach the heights of A Neverending Dream, it also was a hit on TV, radio and in the charts. The second album, Take me Home, was released in the fall of 1997. Like the debut album, it reached #22 in the German charts. Its most successful single became the dance track I Don't Care. In 1998, X-Perience won the radio award R.SH Gold. After a break of three years, X-Perience came back in 2000. Journey Of Life, released by Polydor/Universal, featured a song called The Meaning Of Life, a duet with Neue Deutsche Welle and Gothic icon Joachim Witt. The single Island Of Dreams was used as a title track for the adventure show Expedition Robinson (Survivor). In 2006, X-Perience got a new contract, this time with Major Records in Hamburg. They released their comeback single Return to Paradise and the fourth album Lost in Paradise, including new versions of the first three X-Perience hits, mixed by José Alvarez-Brill. The album also included a duet with Midge Ure (Ultravox, Visage) called Personal Heaven, which was released as another single. With the 2007 single release I Feel Like You Claudia decided to leave the band.

The business community has a vital role in promoting sustainable development: 'development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' (Brundtland Report 1987).
This Case Study examines how BT has developed an approach to sustainability that goes beyond a traditional 'business case' for sustainability to one equally based on moral principles. This is illustrated by BT's approach to connectivity as a means of promoting social inclusion within the UK.
the wider community is not impressed by business's inflated claims about social responsibility and ethical practices where they lack a moral underpinning
by undertaking business activities with integrity and behaving in a social responsible manner, an organisation's brand is enhanced - thereby increasing profitability.
As more and more households and businesses in this country become regular Internet users it is no longer just optional for a leading business brand to have a top quality Internet site. Travelodge was one of the first companies to realise this and its Internet presence has become increasingly sophisticated since 1996.
Travelodge quickly appreciated the importance of developing customer relationships with a global rather than a national audience from the outset and has embraced the Global Distribution System and the worldwide web. Since 1997 all Travelodge properties are listed on the Global Distribution system. These include Galileo, Sabre, Worldspan and Amadeus. These channels offer the opportunity to access the business travel sector worldwide.
In 1996, Travelodge simply used the Internet as a means of promoting its brand image. The site included an online brochure, downloadable maps and a location finder. By 1998 it had developed a new-look site based on printed brochure material. An important breakthrough was the development of online ordering through email request to the reservation sales centre staff. Today the site offers seamless online availability and booking facilities with dedicated business and leisure sections.
Travelodge is a leading edge player in the e-commerce market, offering inclusive packages nationwide. Travelodge’s Internet service enables the company to develop personalised relationships with customers. A database built up by the interactions of customers with the booking site enables it to provide personalised information and to make promotional offers to corporate and family clients. Users can quickly click on to sections of the map that are relevant to their search for accommodation. Users can then narrow down the search to the locality where they want to arrange a business meeting or a short family stay.
Alternatively the user can select from a drop-down list which area and town is required; the lodges available in that area are shown. The site shows clear illustrations of room layout and the facilities offered. Having selected the most suitable Travelodge, the potential customer can then find out about the number of beds available and make an online reservation. Nothing could be simpler. Once the customer has selected a Travelodge they are then provided with the phone number of the lodge, should they need further information.

Vasya's telephone contains n photos. Photo number 1 is currently opened on the phone. It is allowed to move left and right to the adjacent photo by swiping finger over the screen. If you swipe left from the first photo, you reach photo n. Similarly, by swiping right from the last photo you reach photo 1. It takes a seconds to swipe from photo to adjacent.
For each photo it is known which orientation is intended for it — horizontal or vertical. Phone is in the vertical orientation and can't be rotated. It takes b second to change orientation of the photo.
Vasya has T seconds to watch photos. He want to watch as many photos as possible. If Vasya opens the photo for the first time, he spends 1 second to notice all details in it. If photo is in the wrong orientation, he spends b seconds on rotating it before watching it. If Vasya has already opened the photo, he just skips it (so he doesn't spend any time for watching it or for changing its orientation). It is not allowed to skip unseen photos.
Output the only integer, the maximum number of photos Vasya is able to watch during those T seconds.
In the first sample test you can rotate the first photo (3 seconds), watch the first photo (1 seconds), move left (2 second), rotate fourth photo (3 seconds), watch fourth photo (1 second). The whole process takes exactly 10 seconds.
Note that in the last sample test the time is not enough even to watch the first photo, also you can't skip it.

Once you have configured the IP address of an iX Panel, you can attempt to download a new program to the terminal using iX Developer. You have two choices of Ethernet cables that can be used. One is your normal straight through Ethernet cable and the other is a cross-over cable.
A cross-over cable is only used when going point to point, meaning there is not an Ethernet switch or hub used. An example would be connecting a PC directly to an HMI.
A normal Ethernet cable is used when connecting through a switch or hub. An example would be connection a PC to a port on a switch and two HMI’s to ports on the same switch.
Terminals on the network will periodically send a broadcast packet that iX Developer will receive. Any terminals that iX Developer sees on the network will be displayed in the download dialog.
Select a terminal and press download to transfer a project to a terminal. This will erase the existing project on the terminal and replace it. Downloads can take anywhere from 3 to 10 minutes.
If you do not see your terminal listed in the dialog, you can also attempt to download to it by typing in the IP Address of the terminal in “Target” and pressing download. Some networks require this type of downloading because of the broadcast packets not being able to make it to the PC.
If a terminal is displayed in the download dialog, it does not always mean that it can receive a download. Some terminals can be seen on the network, even if there IP addresses are not compatible for communication to your PC.
If you are having trouble downloading to a terminal, then you need to verify it is on the same network as your PC and can be communicated with. Start by sending a ping the terminal. Open a command prompt using “Start”->”Run”->”cmd” or by searching for cmd if using Windows 7.
Once you’ve opened a command prompt, type “ping x.x.x.x” where x.x.x.x is the IP address of the terminal and press “Enter”. If your ping is successful, you will see results such as this.
If the ping is not successful, then your PC cannot communicate with the panel; the IP addresses and subnets of the PC and panel need to be verified. Here is an unsuccessful ping.
To verify the IP addresses and subnets configured in your PC, type “ipconfig” in the command prompt and press enter. To verify the IP address and subnet of your panel go to the service menu. You may want to work with IT personnel for help on assigning an IP address for your device.
Here are some examples if IP address and subnet settings that are incompatible preventing the devices from communicating.
Here are some examples of IP address and subnet settings of two devices that can communicate with each other
Do not use IP addresses ending with .0, .1 or .255 (i.e. 192.168.2.255). Those can have special uses on the network and may not work.

Description Maria Callas was an American-born Greek soprano and one of the most renowned and influential opera singers of the 20th century. She was known for her bel canto technique, wide-ranging voice and dramatic gifts. (1923-1977). This is a portion of a lecture given by John Fisher about Maria Callas. It was given at the Winter Park Public Library on March 9, 1998.
Statistics show that increasing numbers of South Africans are overweight or obese, with the problem at its worst among adult women and preschool children. Many South Africans are eating too much and they’re eating the wrong foods. National Nutrition Week 2014 aims to continue to educate South Africans about portion size and food choices, to change attitudes and habits so that people ‘downsize’ and reduce their health risk. ‘Choose your portion with caution!’ is the central message for National Nutrition Week 2014, building on the 2013 theme in order to strengthen awareness and give information to South Africans about the importance of portion control, in other words: eating healthily by choosing a variety of foods in the right amounts.
The increase in obesity over the past few decades in the world has been accompanied by an increase in food portion sizes, which includes an increase in energy intake. This is called portion distortion or super sizing because people are eating more than they should without even realizing it. South Africa too is following this worldwide trend of an increase in overweight and obesity in all age groups.
In addition to portion distortion, many South Africans also eat too little of certain food groups, such as vegetables, fruit and legumes. In other words, people oversize their portion of starchy foods, fat, meat or chicken or fish and undersize their portion of vegetables, fruit and legumes. Awareness of portion size for each of the different food groups is important to show how much should be eaten.
Frequently eating out at restaurants and buying fast foods and beverages that have bigger than normal portion sizes, especially the ‘value for money meals’;
Serving food at the table, instead of serving the right amounts on the plates before carrying it to the table.
Bigger portions can lead to a higher energy intake, which in turn leads to overweight and obesity. Obesity increases one’s risk of developing high blood pressure, strokes, diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. Furthermore, bigger portions also lead to a higher salt/sodium intake, which further increases the risk of developing high blood pressure, heart disease and strokes.
Consuming bigger portions of certain types of food such as energy dense and nutrient poor take-away foods can take the place of healthier foods, which can lead to inadequate intake of essential nutrients for growth and health. This type of eating plan contains too much energy and too little micronutrients. Essential micronutrients can be obtained from a diet that includes wholegrains, lean meats, legumes, fruits, vegetables and dairy products. Whilst controlling portion size is an effective, simple, reliable and sustainable tool for weight management, eating large amounts of food is just one of the reasons why people become overweight or obese. Eating high-energy foods that are high in sugar, fat and salt, not eating a variety of foods from the different food groups and not doing sufficient physical activity all lead to weight gain and increased health risks.
As more and more South Africans become overweight or obese, their risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers increases.
National Nutrition Week 2014 combined with practical tools, such as the South African Guidelines for Healthy Eating and the Food Guide, will send a strong public message and give people essential information in accessible and user-friendly formats to help them make long-lasting diet and lifestyle changes.

Global Positioning Satellite (GPS) units have been around for many years, now, and many RVers "won't leave home without one." As the years have gone by, the GPS units have gotten smarter and smarter, and pack more and more features into smaller and smaller packages.
Many RVers have a GPS unit that connects to their laptop computer to provide navigation and directions as they travel down the road—with maps showing the general area in which they are traveling.
More recently, several companies have marketed small hand-held GPS units that have almost all of the features of the larger (and more expensive) units.
We were holdouts, and thought that we wouldn't really use a GPS unit while we were traveling, since we always are well stocked with maps and brochures of the areas where we are planning on traveling.
Our minds started to change, however, when we went out to dinner (late in the evening) with one of Linda's cousins and her husband. Their car had a built-in GPS unit, and Mike asked how the unit worked. After the unit was turned on and working, the first good use of a GPS (at night) became very clear. Even though we were out in the boonies of southern Arizona with no moonlight, it was easy to see the GPS screen and know exactly which street we were about to cross (whereas the street signs were completely unreadable in the dark).
Another RV friend commented that he liked his GPS unit because it showed him (before he got there) the twists and turns of an unfamiliar road, as well as showing him where the nearest gas stations were located.
Then, after seeing a small hand-held GPS unit that Linda's younger son and wife had purchased, we found that we had more and more of an urge to get one for ourselves. We decided to "share" a Tom-Tom One hand-held GPS unit with each other for a Valentine's Day present.
Since we have obtained our Tom-Tom GPS unit, we have found yet another use for it that we hadn't thought of before we bought it. We discovered that the Tom-Tom was programmed with most of the businesses in a particular area, especially restaurants and gas stations —as well as hospitals. Most of the time, we no longer have to search for that more and more rare commodity (a local telephone book).
We have used our GPS unit more and more to find a Subway restaurant as we travel down the road, and we find comfort in knowing that, if something happens to either one of us while we are on the road, our GPS unit is capable of directing us to the nearest hosptial.
We very much prefer the portable GPS unit, since we use it far more often in our toad as we are traveling around in unfamiliar cities and towns. It has its own power cord for a 12-volt lighter socket, and it also charges while it is plugged into our laptop via a USB port (although we have not used it that way, except to download the latest maps and data).
But alas, after several good years of guiding us around the USA on our travels of the backroads, age and senility seemed to be affecting our Tom-Tom GPS more and more ...
We were making an around-the United states trip of a lifetime in 2010, when we decided that our old GPS unit was just too tired and senile to continue to serve us reliably. It seemed to be constantly getting confused and routing our travels in weird ways that did not seem correct to us—and we were becoming frustrated with our Tom-Tom GPS.
We were traveling through Louisiana at the time and were visiting RV friends who we had first met in Quartzsite, Arizona, a few years before. We were lamenting the fact that our old GPS unit was giving us fits. As we were being shown around the Lake Charles area, we were impressed with the Garmin GPS unit that Mark Didelot was using to guide us around.
Being the very talented computer savy person that he is, Mark was soon showing us all of the different things that the Garmin Nuvi 1350 could do—as well as showing us the very nifty add-ins that he had downloaded from the Internet.
Needless to say, seeing a first-person demo of the Garmin convinced us that it was the "new" GPS unit that we needed to have.
We visited a local Sam's Club and found the Garmin Nuvi 1350T at a good price, so we dragged out our credit card and purchased it.
Our good friend went right to work and downloaded onto our new Garmin GPS unit the latest maps and the many extra goodies that he had found—and then gave us a tutorial on how to use many of the features. Yes, we were very much impressed!
One of the things that opened our eyes to the possibilities with a new GPS, was being told about a web site on the Internet where we could download all sorts of different "locations" onto our GPS— from different types of restaurants, to roadside attractions, rest stops, fuel stops, and a whole host of other interesting places to visit. We were shown how to select the different POIs (points of interest) for our GPS, and then how to download them from the POI Factory and get them functioning on our new Garmin GPS. Wow! What a bunch of fun stuff.
There are three aspects of the Garmin Nuvi that we especially appreciate, being RVers traveling in unfamiliar areas.
The ability to immediate begin recalculating our route if we miss a turn or choose to go a different direction (instead of screaming at us to "make a U-turn whenever possible").
The wonderful feature of telling us in which of several lanes to be for the next upcoming turn (especially in metropolitan areas with many lanes of traffic in a busy city).
We have no idea of how long our Garmin GPS might last before it, too, develops an inability to accurately guide us to our next destination. (Yes, sometimes it needs a kick in the pants by reattaching it to our computer and letting it get a dose of medicine from the Garmin web site—but, so far, those instances have been very few.)
GPS units are much like computers—they get smarter and smarter, smaller and smaller, and less expensive than previous ones. Our waiting to get our own GPS unit was both a plus and a minus. We realize, now, just how much we like having one, but we also realize that a small hand-held unit with all of the current built-in capabilities was not available even a few years ago. Just like deciding whether to wait for a newer, better computer or just splurge and get one now, getting a GPS unit is similar—at some point you need to just take the plunge (since waiting for something newer, faster, or smaller is going to be a way of life).

U.S. District Court Judge Catherine Eagles has declared North Carolina's new Republican restriction on abortion, passed last year, an unconstitutional infringement of rights. The North Carolina law required women to undergo an ultrasound, and it required doctors to describe what the ultrasound revealed.
Judge Eagles ruled that states don’t have the power to force a health care provider to be the bearer of what she called an “ideological message in favor of carrying a pregnancy to term.” In other words, the new law violates the free speech rights of doctors.
“If these unconstitutional measures had gone into effect, doctors would have been prevented from using their best medical judgment to provide patients with care based on their specific individual needs,” said Jennifer Rudinger, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of North Carolina.

For many, Twitterfeed means you have to use bitly. See, it is very easy to set up Twitterfeed to use your own YOURLS install and effortlessly publish tweets from a custom RSS feed using your own URL shortener. For instance, I do this on the @yourls account, where every source commit on the project gets tweeted.
To do so, create a new feed on Twitterfeed, and in the Advanced Settings, check “Post Link” and pick “Custom” as “Shorten link through” option. You’ll be given an input field to define your “Custom endpoint”. In this field, enter the URL of your YOURLS API, like so:
​I understand that if you have been a loyal customer to some of these brands, you may be hesitant to change. By making the switch, not only will you be fighting for animal rights, you'll also find that it doesn't have to cost you any more money than you spend now. Take a look at my personal Top 3 budget-friendly, cruelty-free beauty brands.
You may have seen promotions for Lush Cosmetics all over your newsfeed. They are most famous for those luxurious bath bombs that everyone is obsessed with. Along with the bath bombs, they have a wide variety of other products to pamper yourself with. Homemade, 100% vegetarian, and their fight against animal testing makes them one of my absolute favorite brands.
The company Crown Brush has been in business for over 30 years so they know everything about producing professional quality makeup brushes. Their products are make with Taklon, a 100% synthetic fiber so they promise that no animals are harmed for the purpose of making their brushes. The brush set that I swear by is the 12pc Deluxe Pink Vegan Brush set. I paid $30 for mine but this brush set can be purchased at www.crownbrush.com on sale for $22.49! Seriously, that's a steal for quality brushes.
You can't beat Wet n Wild nail polish prices. You can pick them up at any grocery or drug store in a variety of colors andthis brand is completely vegan. I don't think most people know that inmost nail polish, fish scales are used in the shimmery colors, and shellac is usedfrom parts ofthe Lac bug. I don't know about you, but I don't want to walk around with fish scales or bug parts on my fingernails.
​These are only a few of the thousands of amazing brands that are out there. Try my suggestions or do some research on your own about cruelty-free products and pick some up the next time you're out. Help us in the fight against animal testing.

From the time the bicycle first appeared in the United States in 1865, until 1893, when the economy of the country went into a depression and the safety bicycle gained a footing in America, the bicycle underwent enormous changes and had profound effects on society. The history of the bicycle in America from 1865 until 1893 has not been written about in any book. During the 28-year period covered in this book, the bicycle affected many aspects of American life. A perusal of the bibliography and the 254 articles gleaned from the research of 27 magazines in this study, provides discernible patterns of thought about the bicycle in U.S. society. Almost no part of American life was untouched by the bicycle. This period in bicycle history preceded its first heyday in the 1890s. Even today, nearly 120 years later, bicycling remains one of the most popular pastimes in the United States.

Ion exchange processes : advances and applications / ed. by A. Dyer, M. J. Hudson, P. A. Williams, 1993
Remember after Jenga’s horrible death the kids decided that we should welcome some love birds into the empty cage. After a rather disastrous search for these love birds on an island three islands away that involved Amory’s front tooth joining all the other treasure at the bottom of our ocean we found love birds.
I reassured him that the fisherman who sold me the birds said 5 was fine. I assumed he would have tried to sell me 6 if 5 was not fine. But as time went by I fear David was right (David is always right.) The little blue bird sat by himself.
After a few months Wesley came back from school having made a Love Shack in carpentry for the birds.
Low and behold it worked. Yellow and Green did naughty things together in the shack and teeny tiny eggs appeared.
After an exhausting few weeks of Mama sitting on her eggs one of them hatched. It actually hatched. And out crept the smallest ball of grey fluff.
But now the trouble started. Papa bird would not let any one near the shack, with Mama and baby inside. He even tried to stop the other birds getting near the food, he was so intent on plumping up his baby. The blue bird and the others got thinner and thinner. Papa, Mama and baby bird got fatter and fatter.
Baby bird’s grey fur coat is now changing to green, like his father, and each day he gets bolder, coming to the front of the shack peering out into the world. Each day the Blue bird watches, alone from his perch, across the cage. Any day now I reckon fat baby will be out of the shack and who do you think he is going to pair up with?
We breed birds. You really should take the breeding pair and their babies out of the main cage and put them alone in another cage, preferably in another room. The stress of being with the other birds could adversely affect the babies as well as their parents.
We will certainly look into that. Thank you. Of course we never thought we would really ever breed the birds!
You are the greatest, India! Love reading your adventures! Good for you to raise lovebirds with the family. Hope you get it right, like the breeder said, and all the little birds will live happily ever after!!
Do tell us if the little blue bird has a friend now. . . BTW, we are an Expat family of 4 living in the Abacos on Elbow Cay (Hope Town)!

WHEW, it's been quiet here for quite a while ... But, not to worry, I'm obviously still alive. I just generally am super busy during November/December – job in retail combined with the annual holiday season insanity. But, I've slowly started to regenerate from this, and to ease myself back into blogging, I decided to sign up for Sari's Pojekt 52, which requires for you to take a picture each week to a different topic.
Theoretically, the best way for me to "come down" after an exhausting day at work would be some candles, relaxing music, and a nice hot bubble bath ... I wish! Alas, it's not possible, due to the lack of a bathtub. So instead I just ploink the tray with the candles and the fairy lights onto the toilet seat, and take a shower while listening to relaxing music – that works too. :D
If you're interested at looking what everyone else posted this week for Projekt 52, you can find the link list here.
It's been a while since we've had the pleasure of doing a style-specific show. In this episode, we check out the reincarnation of an old, lost German sour wheat style. But, we'll let the Beer Jargon Guy fill you in on the specifics.
For our Fermentation Conversation and YouTube beer, all three of us try the Festina Pêche from Dogfish Head. Toby cleanses his palate with the Hottenroth from The Bruery while Mike tries a new beer from a new brewery, Night Shift Somer Weisse. And finally, Dave also tries a new brewery, Strand Brewing and their Cherry Blosum. Pröst!
This fabulous pub is operated by the Marble Brewery and was built in 1888. It has a high glazed ceiling, ceramic walls and a mosaic floor. As well as serving 10+ ales, many brewed on-site, they also sell excellent cheese plates.
It poured an almost clear golden liquid with a small white head. Fruity smell with yeast and pale malts. Similar taste with a herbal bitterness and a peppery finish.
1.) Try to open your thumb, the thumb represent parents, it can be open cause all human does go thru sick and dead. Which is our parents will leave us one day
2.) Please close up your thumb, then open your second finger, the finger represent brothers and sisters, they do have their own family which is too they will leave us too
3.) Now close up your Second Finger, open up your little finer, this represent your children. Sooner or later they too will leave us for they got their own living to live.
4.) Nevertheless, close up your little finer, try to open your fourth finger which we put our wedding ring, you will be surprise to find that it cannot be open at all. Because it represent husband and wife, this whole life you will be attach to each other
I’ve already been canning this season. A lot of people hear this claim and wonder just what it is that I’m canning. The first food I started canning is soup. I get the ingredients from my freezers. Anything that’s starting to get a bit old is fair game. I also save the larger bones from various meats, especially when I have the meat processed by someone else. The meat and vegetables made into soup can quite well and last a lot longer than they would in the freezer. Nothing is quite so nice on a cold winter’s day than hot soup. I usually get two or three servings out of each quart that I can (sometimes four if I add enough additional items). Given the cold winters here in Wisconsin, I can go through a lot of soup.
Once I can the soup, the freezers are less full, so it’s time to defrost them. It’s essential to defrost, clean, and reorganize your freezers every year. Doing so lets you create an inventory of what you have in stock so that you have a better idea of what you need to grow. In addition, you don’t want to keep items so long that they become unpalatable and visually unappealing. Freezer burned food is completely safe to eat, but you may not want to eat it. Some of the ways in which you can prevent freezer burn is to vacuum pack your food and to ensure you rotate it out before it sits in the freezer too long. In some cases, when food is mildly freezer burned, I’ll make it up into pet food (my animals don’t seem to mind as long as the food is prepared to their liking). However, it’s better to use the food up before anything actually does happen to it.
So far I’ve made 14 quarts of chicken soup and another 14 quarts of venison stew. Canning soup means using a pressure canner. Make sure you follow the instructions in a resource such as the Ball Blue Book and the book that comes with your pressure canner. Read Considering the Dangers of Outdated Canning Information for details on keeping yourself safe when using the Ball Blue Book.
It’s also time to can early garden items. For example, when canned properly, rhubarb makes a highly nutritious fruit dish that I eat directly from the jar. You can also make it into pie filling. So far, I’ve made up 7 quarts of plain rhubarb and 7 quarts of spiced rhubarb, both of which will be quite tasty this upcoming winter. Fortunately, you can use hot water bath canning techniques with rhubarb and other high acid foods.
In some cases, you need to mix and match items. The frozen green and wax beans in my freezer weren’t getting any younger, so I used them to make up four bean salad. Actually, it’s supposed to be three bean salad, but some of my recipes called for Lima beans, while others called for kidney beans. I decided to use both, hence four bean soup. I used up all the remaining beans and garnered 16 pints of four bean salad on my larger shelf. Doing so also used up the cans of kidney and Lima beans in my cabinets.
Finally, pickled asparagus can be quite a treat in the middle of winter. So far, I’ve only made up 8 pints of pickled asparagus, but I’ll make up more. I’ll also be freezing some asparagus for fresh use later in the year. In short, canning season has started—time to get going! Let me know about your current canning project at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

Harvest Festival is one of my favorite holidays of the year. What, you haven’t heard of Harvest Festival? Well, it happens each year sometime during September. The date isn’t precise because you just can’t hold Mother Nature to a specific time to make the majority of the fruits and vegetables ripe. That said, the harvest does happen every year and it’s a time to celebrate, even though it also means hard work. I’ve presented Harvest Festival in the past:
What made this Harvest Festival different is that I did the majority of the work on my own. There was lots to do, of course, and I plan to talk about some of the things I did in future posts. This year the Harvest Festival included getting some of my wood for the winter into the basement. My friend Braden helped me get the wood down there—it’s a big job even for two people. I now have five cords down there and two cords outside. Seven cords will take me through most winters, but I’ll cut another cord just in case things get extra cold. The wood you see in the picture is mostly slab wood, with about a cord of logs underneath.
This year the apples ended up as chips for the most part. I also saved some for eating. The larder already has all applesauce, juice, pie filling, and odd assorted other apple products I could use. The remaining apples ended up with friends. I did make up pickled crab apples this year and did they ever turn out nice. I also made a crab apple vinaigrette salad dressing and canned it. The result is quite nice. For once, my pears let me down. The weather just wasn’t conducive to having a good pear crop. I did get enough pears for eating and a few for sharing as well.
Every year is good for something though and it was a banner squash year. The squash vines grew everywhere. At one point, the squash was chest high on me—I’ve never seen it grow like that.
The picture shows the squash about mid-summer. By the end of the summer they had grown into the garden (overwhelming the tomatoes) and into the grass. The squash also grew larger than normal. I ended up with a total of 700 pounds worth of squash (much of which has been preserved or distributed to friends). Here is some of the squash I harvested this year.
The largish looking round green squash (one of which has a yellow patch on it) are a Japanese variety, the kabocha squash. So far, I’m finding that they’re a bit drier and sweeter than any of my other squash. I think I could make a really good pie with one and they’ll definitely work for cookies. Unlike most winter squash, you can eat the skin of a kabocha squash, making it a lot easier to prepare and it produces less waste. Given that I received these squash by accident, I plan to save some of the seeds for next year. The squash I was supposed to get was a buttercup squash. The two look similar, but are most definitely different (especially when it comes to the longer shelf life of the kabocha).
Canning season was busy this year. I’ve started filling in all the holes in the larder. For one thing, I was completely out of spaghetti sauce. Even though making homemade spaghetti sauce is time consuming, it’s definitely worth the effort because the result tastes so much better than what you get from the store. I also made a truly decadent toka plum and grape preserve and grape and pear juice. I’ve done hot water bath canning by myself before, but this was the first year I did pressure canning on my own. Let me just say that it all comes down to following the directions and not getting distracted. My two larder shelves are looking quite nice now (with Shelby on guard duty).
The right shelving unit contains mostly fruit products of various sorts and condiments. Yes, I even make my own ketchup and mustard. Of course, some of the squash also appear on the shelves, along with my cooking equipment and supplies. Let’s just say there isn’t a lot of room to spare.
The left shelving unit contains mostly vegetables and meats. In years past I’ve canned venison, pork, and chicken. This year I thought I might try canning some rabbit as well. Canning the meat means that it’s already cooked and ready to eat whenever I need it. The meat isn’t susceptible to power outages and it lasts a lot longer than meat stored in the freezer. Even though canning meat can be time consuming and potentially dangerous when done incorrectly, I’ve never had any problem doing so.
Harvest Festival 2015 has been a huge success. The point is that I have a large variety of different foods to eat this winter, which will make it easier to maintain my weight and keep myself healthy. I had a great deal of fun getting everything ready. There was the usual music, special drinks, and reminiscing about times past. What makes your harvest preparations joyful? Let me know at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.

The first thing that needs to be done is assess the area where the greenhouse will be. If there is not that much space in putting a free standing version, then perhaps attaching the greenhouse to the home is a good idea.
First things first, you have to make sure that you have the land to plant on. If you have concrete or tile floors all over your pool, then there is a lot to be done. Get a friend or better yet, a tile contractor to help you remove the surface from the ground. This may take a day or two. If you really want a garden despite of this then you have to be patient. Work hard and you will surely arrive at the things that you want.
Why is this one of our vacation safety tips? Because these little critters can be a nasty safety issue when you vacation here and get bitten by one of them.
Water your land prior to planting. This will prepare your land for your seeds. Give it a little love honey. It will give love back to your plants. Do this a day before you plant.
The seminars are a big draw, of course. This year features lectures on koi ponds, native pollinators, chicken keeping, wildlife friendly backyards, bats, garden insects, birds, plantings for birds, and finally, local gardening celebrity Phyllis Stephens presents “All Creatures Great and Small, Gardens for All”.
Many people advise turning watermelons as they grow so that the bottom of the watermelon doesn’t rot. That works in some cases, but more often than not, the turning of the watermelon causes the end of the vine to snap in two. After that, of course, the watermelon is history. Instead of attempting to turn the melons again and again set them up on a small, wooden pallet. A large, flat rock is also sufficient to keep the watermelon off the ground as it grows.
Try to grow only as much as you can use in your garden. After eating fresh vegetables, storing, freezing, and giving away to friends and family there is only so much that a person can use. Do not plant fifty tomato plants unless a vegetable stand is in your future because all those tomatoes will rot on the vines and will not be used.

Fairly hectic. Friday night I was going to put up our Christmas tree since we didn’t get to it on December 1st like we usually do, but we both went to bed early. Friday afternoon I stopped at the cell phone place to renew Damien’s contract and get his new phone, but they didn’t have stock of the one he wanted. They said they’d have it for us by 6pm- but with no money I didn’t want to hang around the mall all evening. I told Damien we’d go back in the morning. Saturday morning I was awake at 7am- I no longer sleep late because if I’m not up- Damien gets up to mischief! I did dishes and a load of washing, and then we went to the mall- they had not had the phone delivered! I was miffed at wasting a trip and Damien was disappointed at not getting his new toy. After that we made our way to Damien’s doctor for our monthly appointment (which is about a 40 minute drive as is) and we got stuck in traffic! I phoned the doc and said we were coming but would be late- and the receptionist said it was cool and not to worry. All in all we arrived 5 minutes late, which I didn’t think was too bad- but he only called us in an hour later! An hour people! Which meant- of course- that we only left there at nearly noon! My mom had made plans to have the four older grandsons from 11 to 5 for a Christmas party but poor Damien arrived quite late. I dropped him off at my mom so he could party with his cousins, and then I went to sister B to watch “Madagascar” with her and her hubby. It’s a very funny movie- the lemur king is hysterical. After that I went home and took my time getting ready for my year end function. Bathed, shaved, washed and blow dried my hair, did my face, got dressed. It was nice and relaxing. Then I grabbed Damien’s (luckily) already packed (and nearly forgotten) bags and dropped them of at my mom’s so he could spend the night, collected B’s boys and took them to her place to pick her up for my year end function. We drove for quite a while to get there- it’s a long way out and very, very larny (read- expensive, like 13 bux for a beer!). Here’s what I ate. For my starter I had the ostrich carpaccio topped with pickled ginger and wasabi paste- surprisingly easy on the tongue. For my main course I had a whole fillet of beef grilled and served with a creamy mushroom and truffle sauce, I could cut my beef with a butter knife! My dessert was panna cotta served with granadilla and berry coulis -divine. Sister B chose for a starter, vine ripened tomato, buffalo mozzarella and crisp potato salad with a basil pesto and balsamic dressing- she said she couldn’t find any potato salad though. For her main course, she had a fillet of kingklip wrapped in streaky bacon topped with a tiger prawn on a warm nicoise salad with a champagne soy sauce- I managed to taste the prawn by stealing a miniscule tit bit off her plate- butter couldn’t be smoother. Sister B’s dessert was amarula tiramisu with berry sorbet- which she assured me was better than my panna cotta. Our bosses very generously paid our bar tab for the first part of the evening and B got herself a bottle of wine which lasted her plenty long enough, in fact I don’t think she finished it. Unfortunately for B and I, one of our company’s little traditions is tequila- one shot- at meetings and events. B and I used to practically live on the stuff but I think we’re getting old! Am I allowed to say that B? We were home by about midnight. Oh, one of my colleagues came to me while we were all standing outside chatting and informed me that they had decided to call me “Crystal” from now on… nope- no idea! Sunday morning I slept late. Yup, I missed church again. Since there’s no Sunday school in the school holidays mom had already told me the previous afternoon that she wasn’t going and I didn’t set my alarm for it. Either that or I slept through it! When I eventually awoke I got up and did another load of washing and then my mom invited me to join her and Damien for coffee in the little mall across the street. That woke me up. Then Damien and I went home, put away the clean washing, hung up the newest load as it came out of the machine, and then went to the mall to fetch his new cell phone (they had finally had it delivered)! Damien was very excited. Then on the way home we got “Charlie And The Chocolate Factory” on DVD, watched it on my laptop, and then went to go and see my brother’s new place. They were still unpacking boxes so we made ourselves useful for a bit. It’s a really nice place- a two bedroom cottage with a laundry, massive living area, nice open plan kitchen and covered patio on a property inside a gated suburb and right around the corner from sister B! Afterwards I stopped at my folks for coffee quickly and then came home. Damien’s new phone had been charging for a while and he got to playing with that until bedtime. We still haven’t put up our Christmas tree and I haven’t started packing for Damien’s bus trip yet!!
We need rescue organisations like Wetnose, Barking Mad, Kitty & Puppy Haven and Labrador & Golden Retriever Rescue because people continue to buy animals from breeders!
I know I’m going to be treading on more than a few toes here, but I really feel strongly about this, today in particular.
Last week I found a dog on the side of the road, and I took him to my vet to stay over for a few days while we tried to make a plan for him. I feel like this makes me more than a little responsible for him.
Tomorrow it will be a week, and my vet can no longer keep him. No one has been looking for him, no one who has been to the vet in the last week is willing to take him on – even as a foster – and I can’t afford to bring him home with me.
He’s now going to the Animal Anti Cruelty League in JHB – THANK GOODNESS – who will be fetching him from my vet tomorrow morning. I am beyond thrilled that he won’t be going to the SPCA, but of all the no-kill rescue organisations in Gauteng, the AACL is the only one with space! I called all of them!
Someone cared about this dog. Even if it was just a little bit. He had a collar, and he had been tied up somewhere. He wasn’t underfed even though he was filthy dirty and he has a few scars. He looks like a small Lab but he has a thick neck like a Staffie. He’s a really sweet, placid boy and the staff at the vet have become quite fond of him. I had no trouble leashing him and leading him to the car.
It makes me sad that he no longer has a home, and I do hope he will be adopted while at the AACL, but what are the chances? He’s not a cute little puppy and he’s not a recognised breed.
And before you bring it to my attention – I’m not referring here to dogs that are bred for a specific purpose, like SAGA’s Labs and Goldens.
Whilst breeders may sell their puppies “to approved homes only” thats the extent of their responsibility, whilst SAGA monitors the health and welfare of every dog they breed for as long as they are alive.
And with that I add another rescue organisation to my donation list (Wetnose and Lab Rescue are the other two).
Rather donate those thousands to a worthy organisation and adopt a dog already in dire need of a home and love and attention.
For a year or so you have a 5:30am wake-up call; digging; chewing; that divine puppy smell; puppy cuddles; tail wagging; 2am toilet runs- even in the rain; and a bundle of lovable fluff that is deceptively smart.
Many years ago, there was a woman with a guide dog living in the block of flats my son and I lived in. Chatting to her briefly one day when she was out with her dog, she mentioned how the pups are raised by volunteer families, and it piqued my interest- but I was working full time and puppy raising wasn’t an option.
When I started working from home in 2010, I asked my husband if he would be open to raising a puppy for SAGA, and he said yes.
The following year we applied to SAGA, and a couple of months later they sent a Puppy Development Supervisor to visit us at home and meet us and our dogs and check out the house.
Once we were approved we went onto the waiting list for our puppy, and on December 22nd 2011 I went to fetch Volt, our first guide dog puppy.
I signed our contract at SAGA’s Puppy Block- after we battled for weeks to come up with a name that started with a U or a V (the letter allocated to his litter)- and after an instructional briefing I left with an adorable puppy, an ID tag, two bags of food, and a 67 page manual.
If you have any idea how cool it is to have an obedient dog, you’ll know how much work goes into training your dog to ‘sit’ or ‘shake’. Now triple that workload and add to it that you will be supervised to make sure your dog is trained properly, with positive reinforcement! And puppies are a handful, no matter the breed.
When your puppy is awake, it is learning. Not only is there a set of verbal commands (sit, stay, down, off, leave it, come, wait, forward and stand), there’s all kinds of behavioural conditioning they need to learn as well, and this doesn’t always have a command.
As a guide-dog-in-training, your puppy is not allowed to chase balls, bark or whine. He has to wait till he’s told he may eat. He has to be comfortable travelling in a car and must be able to go ‘potty’ on command. He has to be comfortable in any setting – from shopping malls to nursery schools. He has to learn to walk calmly and quietly on a lead, on your left hand side. He has to be taught to WALK (not run) up and down all kinds of staircases. He has to learn not to jump up on people, he may not beg, and he must be taught that noises like thunder and fireworks are nothing to fear. They are with you all the time, they go everywhere with you as much as possible.
And the SAGA PDSs are always on hand to ensure the pups are progressing and you have help if you need it.
You have to remember that you are unofficially representing SAGA when you are out with your puppy. You have to get permission for your puppy to accompany you to places that dogs may not be allowed. Security guards can be a nightmare, and while some people will call out to your puppy when you’re out together, others scream and jump out of your way as if your puppy is foaming at the mouth!
And people will ask you questions. The same questions over and over again. The most common one being “…isn’t it hard to give them up?”
Hopefully you’ve done all you were supposed to do and your puppy can start its training as a guide dog with the proper basics already learned.
Your dog’s trainer will keep you up to date with your dog’s progress during its guide dog training, but except to meet your puppy’s new owner when they are ready to graduate and start working together, there is a likelihood you won’t see your puppy again.
Its a year or so of very mixed feelings… you want your puppy to do well and take on its life’s purpose with confidence- but at the same time you love your puppy and you devote a lot of time and attention to it, and you miss your puppy terribly when its gone.
Witnessing your “baby”, fully trained and walking in his harness with his new owner is a moment filled with so much pride and excitement you are almost fit to burst.
You have to hide behind trees and cars on the other side of the street so that your puppy- and he is still a puppy at that stage- doesn’t see you and get distracted from his new job!
Our second guide dog puppy, Lennox, is almost 11 months old so our time with him is almost up. Our first guide dog puppy, Volt, is working as a guide dog in the Cape, and the two weekend “boarders” we worked with have also qualified – Kenzo as a guide dog in the Cape and Rhody as a service dog in KZN.
We are immensely proud of our puppies, and we plan to raise guide dog puppies for many years to come.
If you think back on your school career- and your children’s school career, I’m sure your memories include countless concerts and speech festivals! Probably starting in nursery school!
I remember rehearsals during and after school, late nights performing, costumes made and/or rented, tickets sold, seats booked, sitting through seemingly endless song and dance routines to see your child on stage for maybe 5 minutes… or in my case – watching the teachers trying to catch my child as he ran behind the curtains at the back of the stage!
My precious knucklehead is not a performer. He didn’t like being on stage, he didn’t like performing, unfortunately for him he usually didn’t have a choice. When I was at school I loved the concerts and the speech festivals, I wish I’d been more confident and shown more of what I was able to do!
I was invited to attend the Tsogo Sun SunCares Arts Academy Showcase for seven Diepsloot primary and secondary schools.
These children spent a year auditioning, training, work shopping and rehearsing to perform on this stage, their first ever concert!
Their unbridled enthusiasm, their confidence, their eagerness to show their audience what they’ve been practising was absolutely infectious!
Dressed to the nines in fabulous, brightly coloured costumes and wigs they’d had their make up done and they took to the stage like old pros!
I was grinning and laughing and clapping throughout the show, and the one solo by Ndovhedzo Ndouvhada from Diepsloot West Secondary School gave me a lump in my throat and such goosebumps. Wow.
My favourite performance was definitely the “Superheroes” from Paradise Bend Primary School! They were so adorable I wanted to put them in my handbag and take them home with me!
The stage is all set for the Tsogo Sun SunCares Performing Arts Academy’s year-end concerts which will joyfully showcase what 480 youngsters from 12 underprivileged schools in Gauteng have learned through the integrated programme in the course of the year.
Vusi Dlamini, Group HR Director of Tsogo Sun explains, “The Academy aims to make a real difference in children’s lives by developing their artistic talent, providing life skills development, and supporting the educational framework by creating extra-curricular activities, as well as potentially providing tertiary opportunities to learners within the programme.
“It was piloted in one school in 2012 and then launched in 2013 as a carefully designed full-year curriculum using the arts as a catalyst to provide opportunities for change in the lives of young people in communities around Johannesburg.” The SunCares Arts Academy provides a foundation in the basics of drama, dance, vocal training and voice projection, together with a structured lifeskills course that covers a broad spectrum of topics to empower the youngsters to make sound choices throughout their lives.
The Academy is running in seven schools in Diepsloot near Montecasino and five schools in Mayfair near Gold Reef City, with 480 learners in total – 40 from each school. The learners go through a rigorous selection process to ensure that they have the potential and the dedication to do well in this Arts programme. Grade 4 to 7 learners are selected for the primary school programme and Grade 8 to 10 for the high school programme. Nine primary schools and three high schools are enrolled in the programme this year.
By the time the end of year concerts come around, the youngsters are bursting with excitement and anticipation – and extremely keen to show off their newfound skills to their communities as well as to a wider audience. “The concerts focus on the performing arts that have been learned through the year and incorporate items that display the different school groups’ dancing and performing skills as well as individuals who have shown particular talent in a specific area,” says Shanda Paine, Tsogo Sun’s Group CSI Manager. “The concerts are inspiring and are quite remarkable evidence of what can be achieved with a lot of enthusiasm, a desire to work hard and apply learnings, well-trained facilitators, and a fine-tuned curriculum.”
Renowned South African singer PJ Powers is the patron of the Tsogo Sun SunCares Arts Academy and is deriving immense pleasure from time spent with the children, coaching and encouraging – and instilling a sense of confidence in their ability to be the best they can be.
Tsogo Sun commissioned Minimax Performing Arts, which has been providing young South Africans with a platform to express themselves through the performing arts for more than 12 years, to develop and run the programme in the schools with four co-ordinating staff members and 12 facilitators who are given on-going weekly training.
As with all Tsogo Sun’s SunCares programmes, the Arts Academy is founded on strong partnerships with relevant bodies that include the Department of Education, with the schools, with leading learning and training institutions, and increasingly with the communities where the children who attend the academy live. The scepticism that was evident among parents of the selected children at the start of the programme has dissipated as the children’s academic standards have been maintained, their lifeskills have improved, and they have developed exciting new skills in the performing arts.
The first two concerts are held within the communities where the schools are based and are attended by adjudicators from the National Eisteddfod Association (NEA), who then select the top performers and the best schools to go through to the finals. These will be held at the Lyric Theatre at Gold Reef City on 23 October and will culminate in an awards ceremony for the winners in several categories, including the top high school, the top primary school, the best three individual performers, the most enthusiastic educator and the best performing facilitator.
“This successful initiative has given us the means to provide gifted youngsters from Diepsloot and Mayfair with the knowledge, confidence and lifeskills needed to reach their potential through the performing arts and it is a privilege and a pleasure to be able to give them the opportunity to develop skills and then showcase them on stage in front of an appreciative audience,” concludes Dlamini. “Tsogo Sun is committed to this investment in these young lives and looks forward to many future concerts and to seeing these young lives blossom into accomplished people as they move on in their lives.”

Yesterday I got to watch something truly remarkable. I got to watch a session where SA Guide-dogs Instructors Hayley and Permit trained their dogs for traffic work.
What this kind of training entails is two instructors, each with one dog at a time, and another instructor in a SAGA vehicle, yesterday it was Guide Dog Services Manager
They do practice this on their training walks with what is referred to as “natural traffic”, cars that happen to come along during their training, but traffic work is a step up from that.
They head for a quiet suburb, and then using driveways and intersections down the length of about four blocks – determined at the start of the session – the instructors will walk with their dogs and the instructor in the car will turn into driveways, cross-streets, and approach stop streets in front of the approaching instructor with the dog. Its done at different speeds, sometimes with sudden stops or with the driver of the vehicle backing away and approaching again.
This gives the instructor with the dog the opportunity – under controlled circumstances – to correctly instruct the guide-dog-in-training on how to react and what to do.
The instructors have two viewpoints to each interaction and should the dog be over-eager, or react with fear, they can correct the behaviour appropriately and gently, and end the interaction on a positive note.
This is essential to prevent the dog from associating approaching traffic with a negative experience.
It also gives the instructors, as a team, the opportunity to observe the dog’s reactions to cars and crossing streets as part of their eventual decision on who to partner the dog with.
Its phenomenal to see how well the instructors know the dogs, and how patient they are. Not only must they give the same instructions to each of their dogs, they must tailor how they praise and correct behaviour according to the situation AND the individual dog. This is certainly not a cookie-cutter-training process.
There are no assumptions made with regard to a dog’s progress and personality. An apparently bold dog may be a little nervous in traffic- and vice versa- and each dog is monitored throughout the walk to make sure it has a positive experience and responds properly. And this isn’t done once for each dog, the training is repeated in different areas and on different days so that the dogs know the “rules” apply no matter where they are, as well as to make sure the dogs are okay in any area.
And get this – they have to use different cars and different drivers for these sessions because the dogs are so smart they can actually get accustomed to the drivers and the cars, and they could start thinking that cars can’t or won’t actually hurt them since the SAGA staff are so careful during these sessions!
I want to say a big thank you to Guide Dog Mobility Instructor Hayley; her dogs Zaiden, Cayla, Chiva, Elliott and Bramble; Guide Dog Mobility Instructor Permit; his dogs Zama, Shaun, Abby, Ari and Dakota; and Guide Dog Services Manager Gail (who was behind the wheel today), for allowing me to come along and watch you work.

“It’s so easy for a special needs parent to become so wrapped up in advocating for the rights of this tiny community, that their own child fades into the background. I’m constantly aware of how fine that line is.”
Stacey is mom to three little boys, the eldest of whom has De Morsier syndrome, and she is an outspoken advocate for Autism (her blog is here).
Her status really hit home for me and it got me thinking about being a parent to a special needs child, and how I parent my knucklehead.
Many times in our lives, as he and I lived with ADHD and I became more and more determined to create awareness and educate people about the disorder, it became all about me.
How I had to take time off work to get to doctors’ appointments and occupational therapy and shrinks and speech therapy and parent teacher meetings and school conferences.
My son needed far more help to get through every day than I did, but sometimes I was crusading so hard and feeling so sorry for myself that he got left behind.
First of all, let me state very clearly – so there’s no doubt – if your child is diagnosed with ADHD, you are parenting a child with special needs.
ADHD is often called an invisible disorder, and I must be honest – sometimes I am glad for this. If you are a parent to a child with a visible disability or handicap, you are subjected to pitying looks and outright rudeness! Its as if being able to see that someone’s child is different entitles people to ask questions at point blank range.
Do people REALLY think that the parents of a child with a disability or handicap of any kind have not ALREADY done – and are doing – as much reading and research as they possibly can?
Look at it this way. If you tell someone your child is asthmatic or diabetic- also fairly invisible disorders- people seldom launch into a diatribe about how its a fake disorder created so drug companies can profit. They’re still quick to make suggestions about treatments and tell you of their own experiences, but mostly the show concern and empathy.
If you tell someone your child has been diagnosed with ADHD however, they don’t ask how you’re doing. There’s no empathy. They say things like, “Ooh is she on Ritalin?“, “Well I hope you’re not drugging him!“, and “Oh I was just like him as a child but my parents disciplined me properly.”
Do you know that children with an ADHD diagnosis have a worse quality of life than children with asthma or diabetes? They don’t do well at school, they don’t do well with interpersonal relationships, they’re always in trouble, and they blame themselves.
For me, raising a special needs child feels like I am always on the defensive. Even now, with a grown up son.
Every single time someone mentions ADHD, I brace myself for the slew of jokes and opinions that inevitably follow, tossed about by people who only ever read YOU and Huisgenoot, or watch Carte Blanche. Even if they’re not actually talking to me, I have to all but bite my tongue and I am not always successful.
If I’d worked harder perhaps my son would have finished school. Perhaps he would have gone on to some kind of tertiary education, perhaps he may even have become the Marine Biologist he always wanted to be.

CCT helped the Library of Congress build a national network of master teachers and librarians to create and publish exemplary curricula around its online collections. The Fellows Program combined online, face-to-face, and practicum teaching experiences, enabling educators to develop innovative Web-based humanities curricula and share results with colleagues. The archived project website remains accessible.
This report summarizes responses of Master Teachers to questions from a program application form and a survey administered at the conclusion of every Intel Teach to the Future Master Teacher training in the United States between March 2001 to July 2002. The data reported here demonstrate that Master Teachers' responses to this training have been highly positive throughout the life of the program. Findings reported here include the following:
Master Teachers give high ratings to the curriculum and to the trainers who provided this professional development experience.
Master Teachers report that the program focuses heavily on topics that are the core intended themes of the training.
The data summarized here are referred to in other reports discussing findings from the evaluation of Intel Teach to the Future. Education Development Center's Center for Children and Technology (CCT) has been conducting an independent evaluation of the U.S. implementation of Intel Teach to the Future since March 2000.
Subjects. All teachers who completed the Intel Teach to the Future Master Teacher training were expected to complete this survey. Participant Teachers from this program completed a slightly different version of this survey at the conclusion of their training, and those results are presented in a separate report. Variations between Master Teacher and Participant Teacher responses are noted in this report.
The total number of valid responses to this survey was 1,702. Paired t-tests were used to calculate change in Master Teachers' responses to some questions included both in the application to the program (prior to training) and in the survey administered at the conclusion of the training.
Instruments. The survey is presented in Appendix A. The survey was developed by CCT in consultation with the ICT and Intel staff involved in developing the curriculum. Minor revisions were made to the survey in Spring 2001.
Procedures. This survey was administered via the World Wide Web. Specifically, the survey was mounted within an extranet maintained by Intel for Intel Teach to the Future participants. Teachers were asked to complete the survey at the conclusion of their training. The data reported here were collected between March 2001 and July 2002, with 82% of submissions being made between May and August 2001. The largest number of submissions in a single month (June 2001) was 640.

Kauai’s North Shore is famous for breathtaking ocean views, shops, beaches and surfing. The North Shore is also where you and your Family can spend hours on the golf course and be amazed by the natural beauty all around you. Let us introduce you to the Prince Golf Course in Princeville.
This stunning golf course combines the backdrop of the Pacific Ocean with beautiful views of Kauai’s Mountains to the north. The multi-million dollar renovation was overseen by renowned architect Robert Trent Jones, Jr., who originally designed this course. The results put this course high on the list of “must-play” locations for avid golfers.
Named after Prince Albert, son of Hawaii’s King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma, the Prince Golf Course will help you feel like royalty. The award-winning par-72 course is ranked by Golf Digest as the “#1 Golf Course in Hawaii” and “one of America’s Top 100 Greatest Courses.” Golf Week also rates the course among “America’s “Best 100 Resort Courses” and Golf Magazine includes it in the “Top 100 Courses.”
From the first tee to the 18th green, you will know why this course is a golfer’s dream! Lucky for all of us, there are more great golf courses to explore on the North Shore!
The Makai Golf Club (above) offers one of Hawaii’s premier championship layouts with 27 holes, located at the Princeville Resort. Also designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr., the Makai opened in 1971 and is consistently ranked as one of Hawaii’s top golf experiences.
The Makai Golf Club was reopened in early 2010 after a wonderful renovation and now consists of two uniquely individual courses. The 18-hole Makai Course incorporates original Lake and Ocean nines, and plays to a par 72 with four sets of tees extending the course to more than 7,200 yards. The signature 7th hole on this course plays to 213 yards from the back tees. It opens with a difficult tee shot over scenic cliffs onto a green surrounded by sandy bunkers and a backdrop of the mountains and Pacific Ocean.
For casual golfers, the 9-hole Woods Course offers a leisurely game in a more relaxed layout. The course winds through the native woodlands of Kauai’s North Shore and provides a Fun, scenic afternoon for everyone.
In the mood to tighten up your game? The updated facility features 2 large new practice tees, a practice fairway bunker, a short game practice center, and seven target greens. Combined with its knowledgeable staff, the Makai Golf Club is a premier destination for all golfers!
Poipu Bay Golf Course was home to the PGA Championship from 1994-2006, and is the only course that provides a stunning view of “Mahaulepu,” an undeveloped part of Kauai’s coastline where you get a distant view of rock formations over 5 million years old. This amazing view helps fill your golf day with Fun and Amazement.
Designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr. (can you tell he knows his golf courses?) – Poipu Bay Golf Course features 210 oceanfront acres that meander and weave along Kauai’s coastline. Within this course sits 85 bunkers, 5 ‘water hazards,’ and winds that change daily – making each round a unique and individual experience! Combine this with 30 acres of tropical plants, flowers, and coastal views of humpback whales spouting in the distance (during winter months) and we have a golf course that is exceptionally Kauai! Also, the golf carts feature satellite navigation so you never will get lost looking for your ball!
Poipu Bay Golf Course also has historical and cultural significance. It is designed around ancient places of worship (heiau) and handmade stone walls estimated to be over 500 years old. Golfers may find peace of mind while playing their ball around these special areas.
Situated in Poipu, it is another amazing course designed by the one and only Robert Trent Jones, Jr. It too features remnants of an authentic Hawaiian village built into this unique course that also showcases beautiful scenery in a challenging golf environment.
One cool thing about The Kiahuna Golf Club’s website is that it offers tips from their golf pros on how to play each of their holes. Before your trip, visit the site and view the pictures and watch the videos so you’ll have a head start on conquering this challenging course.
After your game, grab your Friends and head to Joe’s on the Green where you can relax and have a nice tropical beverage and share stories about your day on the links.
The Kauai Lagoons Golf Club in Lihue offers 27 holes designed by golf legend Jack Nicklaus. “The Kiele Course” is an 18-hole course that weaves through mango trees and takes golfers through Kauai’s “Amen Corner.” (That’s an area that once you make it past, folks often say 'amen' and keep going!)
The outward nine boasts the longest continuous stretch of ocean holes on Hawaii. WOW! Look at the photo above. Can you smell the ocean air already? We can!
The Waikane Nine, also at Kauai Lagoons Golf Club, is a more ‘forgiving’ course that is especially suited for juniors and families. At 12 noon you can combine the Waikane Nine with the Kiele Mauka Nine for an affordable 18-hole round of golf. This is GREAT for Kauai travelers who want to golf and maintain a set budget. Either way, the views and experience of playing this unique course will stay with you long after your visit. : - )
Another great course on the East Side is the Puakea Golf Course with its majestic views of Mount Haupu and the Pacific!
Designed by one of Hawaii’s most renowned architects, Robin Nelson, this course utilizes deep ravines and mountain water-fed streams to challenge players and surround them in Kauai’s natural beauty splendor! Each round is different at Puakea as the position of the sun, direction of the wind, and course characteristics help you and your Friends have the best day ever. : )
Before you leave for Kauai, check your airline’s policy on golf clubs. Some airlines place limits on checked items and a hard golf case is recommended to protect your clubs. For more useful advice for flying with clubs, visit GolfLink here. Another idea is shipping your clubs to Kauai.
If you prefer to leave your clubs at home, the golf pro shop at Makai Golf Club in Princeville has knowledgeable staff who can assist you in finding a perfect set of clubs for your Golf adventure!
WOW! There is sooooo much for golfers to experience on Kauai. And the great news? There is still plenty more to do! While you are on the golf course and after your game, join the Family for splashing in the water, going on a hike, relaxing at the spa, and after the day is done… Enjoy a fun night on the town!
Taking time to create Fun, loving memories with Family and Friends is one of the best things we can do to reward ourselves for our year-long work – and golfing is just one of the many FUN activities to Enjoy on Kauai!

It’s September! Fall is here and there are so many things to be excited about. The leaves are changing colors, in many parts of the world and kids going back to school. Seems like it was only yesterday when we started our Spectacular Summer Vacation Countdown on Kauai and when we think about all our Friends who visited Kauai this year AND chose Kauai Vacation Rentals & Real Estate, Inc to help them create an amazing, fun-filled vacation… we grow great big smiles on our faces!
And what a summer of Fun! Water Adventures, Hiking the Great Outdoors, Relaxing and Unwinding on Kauai, Fun Kauai Nights, and Your Next Kauai Adventure! Days upon days upon nights were spent exploring, having Fun, and celebrating well deserved time off on one of the most beautiful islands in the world!
A great part of all the Fun for us is reading the comments our Friends post on our Facebook wall and the messages they share on Twitter! Like, when one Friend sends to another, “I want YOU to meet me on Kauai!” – and then we get to watch their Friends start assembling their vacation plans right in front of our eyes J And when they call us to book a home, cottage, condo or villa…it’s like we are already part of their vacation!
Today we are sharing a Fun story from one of our Facebook Friends who just got back home after vacationing on the South Shore! She talks about reading our posts and how they kept her and her family excited for their trip and how they look forward to staying with us on their next vacation!

Ahhhhh. Just thinking about my vacation makes me want to head back to the airport tomorrow morning! I spent 6 days on the South Shore in August and every day felt like I won a dream vacation right out of a magazine!
I am a single mom who works around the clock and rarely takes time for vacation. And every day this year I kept seeing these awesome photos posted by Kauai Vacation Rentals & Real Estate, Inc and sometimes I would just sit in front of my computer screen rubbing suntan lotion on my arms while drinking iced tea with a little umbrella poking out above the rim of my glass. Then I would close my eyes and imagine myself stand up paddle boarding while Poipu Beach glistens in the background.
Then it dawned on me. I CAN BE THAT PERSON in the photo! I WANT to go to the Hukilua! I AM the woman sitting on the boat gliding through paradise watching my kid’s hair blowing in the wind. So without hesitation I called my mom and said “how would you like to go to Kauai with me and my daughter?!?!”
She howled with excitement and set the phone down suddenly and, before I knew it, she was walking through my front door! (She lives close by!) She was already wearing her sun hat talking about the movie “South Pacific” and with that burst of excitement I became even more excited! The days flew by as we started planning all our adventures, and thanks to all the Fun things Kauai Vacation Rentals & Real Estate, Inc shares on Facebook, we knew a fantastic vacation was about to unfold!
And oh how fun it was! When my Friends at Kauai Vacation Rentals & Real Estate, Inc asked me to share my “Top 5 Highlights” from my Spectacular Summer Vacation on Kauai, I did not hesitate. Believe me, if you are looking for a great vacation destination to please a child under 10, a grandma/mom over 70, and a business woman over… eh… well let’s just say “forever 30”… Kauai should be at the top of everyone’s list!
Before getting to Kauai, I researched lots of Fun things to do and I made a list. Then when I got to Kauai, I just decided to “let each day happen.” That means on some days I got to rise with the sun and meditate and do yoga on the beach. Other days, my daughter woke me up with her own list of things she wanted to do.
Every day we had options, like Kauai Backcountry Tubing at the former Lihue Plantation, a day at sea with Captain Andy’s Na Pali Coast Tour, and spending time in the glorious sun at Poipu Beach. Yes, the “organizing” side of my brain wanted to plan every moment and every meal in advance – and somehow, letting it all go and “flowing” day-to-day made this Kauai vacation extra special. I know my family and I will remember it forever!
Seriously, I had never heard that word before nor did I know what it was until we got there. What a blast!
SNUBA® is a cross between “snorkeling” and shallow water “scuba” – without the need to get certified or having to be an expert underwater diver! For me, that means grandma could have an underwater swim with my daughter and me while being expertly watched by a SNUBA® instructor/guide.
The website says it is like swimming in a giant aquarium surrounded by tropical fish. It was more like exploring “under the sea” where we would expect to find Ariel (the Little Mermaid) and her underwater friends Flounder and Sebastian. It was so much Fun and the activity includes expert instruction with the convenience of always being 20 feet away from the “security” raft floating on the surface.
Captain Andy knows how to deliver a great time! Trip Advisor ranks it the #1 in tourist attractions on Kauai and getting to see parts of the island that are inaccessible by car made us feel like we were on an adventure, custom-made for us!
The activity’s official website says “This fifteen-mile stretch of rugged coastline on the northwest shore of Kauai literally means "the Cliffs." Much of Na Pali Coast is inaccessible due to its characteristic sheer cliffs that drop straight down, thousands of feet into the ocean. Sailing, rafting and hiking are the best ways to experience Na Pali's myriad of natural wonders.”
I am so glad we took this tour! We saw dolphins, Flying fish, and everywhere we looked there were amazing views!
On this trip we took the Sunset Cruise, which is great because we got to see Kauai lit up by the twilight sun. There is also a daytime cruise that can be paired with snorkeling, which is exactly what we will be doing for sure on our next trip!
I was determined to learn how to surf on this trip and my daughter was like, “you’re doing it – I am doing it!” So we were excited to book with Kauai Surf School.
The waves on the South Shore were perfect and the instructors are very friendly! This school is great for people of all ages and although my mom didn’t hang ten on the surf board, she had a great time taking lots of pictures!
After our day of surfing, we took time to “relax” and kick back on Poipu Beach. I did the research and the tips Kauai Vacation Rentals & Real Estate, Inc share on Twitter are true! It is a GREAT beach for families! Body surfing, snorkeling, and the shallow protected area is ideal for kids. We had turtle sightings every day and the Nukumoi Surf Shop across the street is convenient for water shoes or anything else you may need for a day at the beach!
My vote: The instructors at Kauai Surf School are awesome and Poipu Beach is also a perfect spot for sunrise yoga and morning runs!
I love that we rented a car on Kauai. It really gave us the ability to do whatever we wanted and Enjoy our vacation “family time.” Another highlight is the 2-mile hike we took at Shipwrecks Beach. It is part of the Mahaulepu Heritage Beach Trail.
According to the website: it is the last stretch of undeveloped coastline on the South Shore. The Mahaulepu Heritage Beach Trail is a great coastal hike that takes you from the southeast corner of Shipwrecks Beach / Keoiloa Bay along sand-dune cliffs, Kiawe trees, limestone formations and rocky inlets where you can see sea turtles and Hawaiian Monk Seals.
My photo on the right shows the terrain and I want to say… when you are standing here, you feel a majestic sense of peace and tranquility that makes you feel like you are really on vacation in a place far from the routines back home.
Another great spot we visited is Spouting Horn. Also on the South Shore, waves push water through a rock formation and water then sprays up into the air, like a Hawaiian Old Faithful. Nearby shops are totally cute and a great place to buy souvenirs and jewelry, which I am wearing now! : - )
Then there is Wailua Falls. The beautiful water flowing overhead made me feel like I was in the opening shot of “Fantasy Island!” The plane, the plane! The double waterfall is magical!
I have been home for about 2 weeks now and every morning when I wake up, I think about the smile on my face, my daughter’s face, and my mom’s face. Kauai is a wonderful vacation destination with hiking and activities we all Enjoyed. In the back of my mind, I pictured Kauai as a perfect place to chill, kick back on the ocean, and do nothing. Well…. There was certainly “chill” time, and there are also plenty of FUN activities for everyone – and being outdoors spending quality time with my family was a reward and a spectacular treat.
We did “chill” one day, and for the most part I started my day at 6 AM with yoga, then did a big activity at 9 AM or 1 PM or 3 PM (that's when the tour-type things leave). I probably spent at least 2 hours a day in the pool or at the beach. And yes, we definitely found time for shopping!
We love Poipu Shopping Village and The Shops at Kukui'ula Village, where we bought clothes, souvenirs, and ate some fabulous meals. I would say I was pretty active on this 6-day holiday and I still found time to read, take a nap, and keep my 10-year old moving and having Fun.
I now know where I want to vacation every chance I can! My daughter wants to move there and says it was the best trip ever. She basically lived in the water and even though our schedule was busy, it didn’t feel over programmed. In fact, it was exquisitely perfect. : -)
Now, the memories of making leis, taking hula lessons, feeding koi, surfing, snuba’ing, shopping, tubing, and hiking have me smiling and counting the days till our next visit.
Ready for a mouth-watering meal made of fresh, local ingredients? Then join us for a unique culinary romp through paradise, led by Marta Lane. This wonderful tour introduces you to some of Kauai’s food growers and makers. Stroll through an exotic fruit orchard, taste local seasonal fruit, and meet executive chef Guy Higa during a cooking demonstration.

I don’t even know where to begin when it comes to unemployment and young people without sounding like an old doucher (insert old man voice here: “I remember when I was a youngster and times were tough, we did whatever it took to make a dollar.”) but I just read a post by Herb Engert that put me over the edge. In it, he addresses the frightening statistics of joblessness among young people today. The entrepreneurs in the 30 and under group he researched suggested five key imperatives for action: expand funding alternatives, increase mentoring and broader support, change the culture to tolerate failure, target and speed up incentives, and reduce red tape and excessive taxation. Though compelling, these suggestions from this particular group make me want to blow my top, and here’s why.
I’ve been working with Gen Y and Millenials for close to a decade, and I have been stunned by the decline in personal responsibility, drive, and motivation each year has brought to each new population of young people I work with. I’ve witnessed a 23+ year old have a public tantrum because his instructor “didn’t respect” him (actually, I’ve lost count of how many students have publicly decried being “disrespected” by an instructor because the instructor didn’t let them off the hook). I’ve had to take countless telephone calls from parents of 20somethings and 30somethings complaining that their child isn’t learning anything and then, when confronted with the fact that their child has a 67% attendance rate, giving excuse after excuse as to why we should allow their (adult) child off the hook (“She’s having a really bad year,” “She just got her 2nd D.U.I. and she’s really depressed,” “He has insomnia and can’t be at school by 9:00. Can’t you make an exception?”) I’ve been saddened by the W.I.F.M. sense of entitlement that is so pervasive among this population, their cutthroat, back-stabbing, reality-TV-esque interactions. The “Even though you may be smarter, stronger, or better than me, I’m going to make sure you lose, or at least look bad, so that I look better; even though I’m not going to do anything to be better, smarter, or stronger. I just don’t want you to win because if you win, we’re not on the same level.” I guess I shouldn’t be shocked. After all, this is the generation where everyone won a trophy, whether they played by the rules or not. Maybe all this nonsense started there.
When I was growing up (again, insert old man voice here), if you played on a team there were winners and there were losers. If you won, you celebrated. If you lost, you licked your wounds for a minute but then you went out and practiced that much harder. No one wanted to suck or be a loser. Fast forward twenty years and at little league and t-ball fields across the nation, kids learned that it didn’t matter if they won or lost, they would still win a trophy anyway. I’m pretty sure that’s when the coaches stopped being allowed to teach kids to win because parents didn’t like it when their kid cried because they sucked – I mean, lost. So, coaches stopped coaching (or, bullying, as some psychotic parents suggested) and started telling the kids that “everyone is a winner,” which we all know is horse shit and the parents all patted their kids’ heads and nodded their own heads in agreement. Or, maybe this phenomenon occurred when parents, guilty because they both had to work long hours at the office to maintain their American Dream – Toll Brothers McMansions, mid-size luxury sedans and SUVs, golf, Abercrombie & Fitch, riding lessons, Uggs, and The Northface for the kids – decided to let their kids off the hook for everything. “I don’t feel like cleaning my room,” “I don’t want to go to practice,” “Amy has the new Uggs. I can’t believe you won’t get them for me,” “What do you mean we can’t go to Great Wolf Lodge for a week? You suck!” Exhausted and over-worked, parents started picking their battles, discipline, dedication, drive, and ass-kicking competitiveness obvious losers, lifeless on enemy soil. “I’m sorry, sweetheart. We’ll make it work,” they replied. “I was going to get you those Uggs for Christmas, honey,” they quickly recovered. “I know your team lost today but you will always be a winner,” they lied. And their kids, smug with a win, nodded in agreement, their Facebook likes, Twitter and Instagram followers, an obvious confirmation of their awesomeness (right?). The fascinating thing about this? These same parents are (gasp) shocked that their adult kids are a.) still living at home or, b.) moving back home after unsuccessful jaunts in the real world due to their unrealistic expectations of how the real world should operate (“What do you mean I’m not getting promoted to vice president of the company after being here for six months?” “They treated me like shit. Like who the fuck are they to ask me to make copies for them?” “I could run that shit a thousand times better than they do.”).
On the flip side, there are some things I admire about this generation (shocking, right?). I love the fact that they are more open to creating their own careers and that they have no fear when it comes to doing just that. I admire their confidence when it comes to self-promotion. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen so many people tout their awesomeness, whether true or not, and the fact that they can build a business off of the spin they generate about themselves is amazing. My generation had to have proof in their pudding before they spouted off about how excellent they were but, as a result, have built long-term success is their careers and the businesses they developed. For example, alongside my husband, I helped grow our business to several million dollars a year in business from the ground up. We had no choice of funding alternatives – we went to a family friend who loaned us money to use as collateral to get more money from the bank. We had no mentors or support – the company we franchised with was brand new to the franchising game so, we in essence, grew up along with them. We would NEVER expect culture to change to accept our failure – failure wasn’t an option, period. We had no government incentives – we had achievement and success and pride as incentives. And, taxation? It is what it is and we made sure our profit margin fit within our tax structure. So, with that said, the five key initiatives I would suggest to young entrepreneurs are this:
1. Stop whining about what you need and wondering who is going to hand it to you. We don’t need to expand funding alternatives so that you can start your business. Like most people that have built successful businesses before you, get up off your ass and go make it happen.
2. Stop expecting other people to create what you need. It’s hilarious to me that with allllllll the thousands of “friends and followers” you guys all have via social media, you’re crying that you need us to create business networking groups for you guys to more readily share information. Instead of telling your thousands of friends and followers what you drank last night at happy hour, or what you’re eating for lunch today, why don’t you ask them if they can recommend a mentor? Or, if you want to build a support network for your entrepreneurial aspirations, why don’t you use your social media skills to build one? Or, should we create an association to do that for you, too? I just read something in a John Maxwell book that said something like, “If you want a glass of milk, you don’t go out and sit in a field expecting the cow to walk up to you and put its nipples in your hands.” Sage advice, obviously paraphrased, but sage advice, nonetheless.
3. STOP ACCEPTING FAILURE AS AN OPTION AND STOP EXPECTING US TO ACCEPT YOUR FAILURE AS AN OPTION FOR YOUR FAILURE. It is nauseating to go back and reread the three bullet points: government needs to promote entrepreneurs as crucial job creators (no they don’t if you do what you say you’re going to do), society needs to be more tolerant of failure and recognize entrepreneurs as innovators (“Even if you lost today, you’ll always be a winner to me, sweetheart.” Is that what you need? Then you’re not cut out to be an entrepreneur.), schools and universities must help students make the right career choices (oh, that’s right, we need to parent you because your parents were so busy telling you how awesome you are and how you’ll be successful at anything as long as you believe you’re successful, that they forgot to tell you that if you want to be successful you have to work your fucking ass off.)
4. Stop looking to the government to create solutions to your inability to make shit happen. Sure, it would be great if there was a program that could help everyone become an entrepreneur but if you look at programs the government creates to help everyone, there are rarely any self-made success stories. Quite the opposite.
5. Taxation is what it is. If you think the government is going to lower taxes, or make special concessions because you want to start a business and it needs to be easier, then you’re not cut out to be an entrepreneur. Big businesses that have received special tax loopholes became so successful WITHOUT those loopholes that they can now hire people to go to Washington and create new loopholes for them. Soooooo, in other words, go get super successful and then you, too, can get special tax treatment.
In closing, I’m sure I’m going to receive tons of flack for this post (“You don’t know what it’s like to be young,” “You’re negative,” “You suck,” “You’re a dream killer,” “You’re already successful. Fuck you,” “You don’t understand what these kids are going through,” “Blah, blah, blah”) but I’m reminded of a quote when I think of this, as I, like Herb, do often. It’s from my husband’s grandfather who used to say: “Shit in one hand and wish in the other. See which one fills up faster.” Herb was right when he said that this is a generation that can be great, but it has to start with young folks not wishing but taking action; however, shitting in their hand isn’t necessarily an action I would suggest.
I was saddened to hear of the death of His Eminence Cardinal Józef Glemp, the former Primate of Poland and Archbishop of Warsaw, on Wednesday at the age of 83.
Cardinal Glemp was an eminent figure in the history of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, having guided the Polish Church through a very difficult period in its history.
As a close associate of Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński, and later Blessed John Paul II, he was entrusted with a key responsibility as Archbishop of Gniezno in 1981, which made him Primate of Poland.
As head of the Polish Bishops’ conference, he was to lead his flock through a time of severe Communist repression during the 19 month period of Martial Law. While he was often under pressure to take political positions, he steadfastly remained focused on the spiritual well-being of the faithful, knowing that this was the key to defeating the morally bankrupt Communist regime.
When the Jaruzelski regime finally fell in 1989, His Eminence Cardinal Glemp led the revival of the Polish Church in free Poland, leaving a proud legacy of accomplishments including the construction of the National Temple of Divine Providence in Warsaw. In 2009, His Eminence received a well-deserved Order of the White Eagle for his contributions to the Polish nation from the hands of President Lech Kaczynski, who later died tragically.
Cardinal Glemp belonged to that generation of Polish leaders who had to rebuild a Poland deeply scarred by the experience of two totalitarian empires, the legacy of brutal war, the execution of the Holocaust in their midst, and a public life built on lies. He made his own remarkable contribution to this difficult task of historical recovery, cultural restoration and reconciliation between peoples.
Today I join Canada’s Polish community and the people of Poland in mourning the passing of this remarkable religious leader, and in praying for the repose of his soul.

I am grateful that she's learning to be independent in some ways. She can dress and undress herself, go potty by herself, and get basic snacks from the pantry. But along with that new found independence comes this phrase "Grace do it!" I swear if I never heard that again, I'd be perfectly happy; but alas, I'm sure I will hear it within about 2 minutes of her waking up in the morning. I hear it constantly. Try to help her get her shoes on? "Grace do it!" Try to help her sit on the potty? "No mama, go away. Grace do it!"
Her new found independence has led to her desire to change her clothes literally at least 10 times a day. While I'm busy with Connor she will sneak into her room and 5 minutes later will come out in a completely different outfit. Sometime she announces it to me "look mama, new clothes!" Other times she will try to sneak it past me, hoping I won't notice after I have told her time and time again to leave the clothes on that we put on that morning. I guess she thinks that I don't enough laundry to do! Oh and each time she changes, she adds a new hair accessory and shoes. Her closet is constantly a wreck because of her digging through it to find her latest ensemble. She has now taken it upon herself to pick my clothes for me as well. This day she was being nice and giving me a choice between two shirts. When I told her I needed something long sleeved, she said with authority "No mama, this one or this one!"
Recently, she has decided that she is now Connor's caretaker and boss. Overall it's adorable and hilarious, but he's not always thrilled about her "instructions." While I was doing laundry today, I poked my head out to find her checking the back of his diaper. She pulled it back, made a face, and told me that he pooped. I'd never seen her check like that before but she obviously knew what to do! Later, she lined up their two chairs, told him to sit down and instructed him to hold her hands. He wasn't thrilled but did what he was told.
I don't know exactly what he intention was but she was content with this. It lasted for a few seconds before he pulled away screaming. She tried to convince him to do it again, but he wouldn't do it. After a couple minutes of this, I told them to pick up the train pieces that you can see thrown all over the living room. In true 3 year old form, I saw Grace go pick up the bin and say to Connor "pick up trains Onnor (her name for him.) In here, pick up!" She showed him how to put one piece in and proceeded to hold the bin while he picked the pieces up. I didn't let that fly and made her pick up as well, which she was not thrilled about.
She's so full of personality and I'm always amazed to see what she's going to do next. She's actually having a speech evaluation done next week because she's still not talking a ton so I'll update when I know more about that. Having a 3 year old is definitely challenging, I'm not looking forward to her teenage years!!

A blend of three different vintages, this super Champagne is a rich expression of ripe and dried fruit with a gentle, and persistent, freshness coming through. A subtle and beautifully crafted framework which is the signature of Gosset champagnes. This Champagne comes beautiful packaged with two excellent quality Gosset Champagne flutes and a Gosset champagne closer.
What a treat to receive! Two super French wines presented in a two bottle wooden gift box. The white is a classic Sancerre from Domaine des Brosses. It pours a bright and pale golden colour. The fresh, citrussy palate is richly textured but with crisp acidity and textbook minerality. The finish is elegant with typical purity and refreshment of excellent Sancerre. The red is an equally delicious bottle - an organic red Cahors, Chateau de Chambert which is a wine with powerful fruit intensity yet elegant structure and the long, classy finish of the very best Cahors.

Diploid: "a cell containing two sets of chromosomes, inheriting one from each parent." An example of this would be a cell in the human body. Often times a (2n) denotes when something is diploid.
Gamete: "A haploid reproductive cell, such as sperm or egg. Gametes unite during sexual reproduction to produce a diploid zygote."
Haploid:"a cell containing only one set of chromosomes." An example of this would be human sex cells; sperm and egg. Often times an (n) denotes that something is haploid.
Sporophyte: "In organisms that have an alternation of generations, the multicellular diploid form that results from the union of gametes. The sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis that develop into gametes."
2. This gamete and the gamete of another fern come together to form a diploid zygote. This is called fertilization.
All ferns, including Bracken ferns, need water to fertilize. Due to this adaptation if a Bracken fern lives in a habitat where seasons occur they emerge in the spring and die off in the autumn. The spores are usually dispersed in late summer or early autumn. Spores can be carried by the wind to new destinations where the spore will wait to be germinated.
The leafy part of the fern is called a frond. The small leaf-like structures that make up the frond are pinnae. Small clumps are patches are on the underside of the frond and this is where the spores are located. If a frond has spores on its underside than it is called a "fertile frond."
When Bracken ferns first emerge from the ground they have structures called, "fiddleheads." Some people eat these. These "fiddleheads" unfurl themselves and grow into fronds. A young Bracken fern will light green and soft. The older they get the darker green they become and the harder their pinnae get.

Aplysia dactylomela is a large, slug-like animal with a fleshy appearance quite similar to a Jellyfish, or the Portuguese Man of Water. It averages in length from 15-16 cm as an adult, but can grow as large as 40 cm long, and weight in at over 5 kg (EOL n.d.(b), Overly n.d., University of Miami 2009) . A Sea Hare, this organism’s rhinophores resemble the ears of a rabbit, hence the name 'Sea Hare' (Overly n.d.). It has a very subtle color theme, ranging from pale yellow to light brown, with many shades of olive green and cream. The shade and color varies with the food it eats. Red Algae, A. dactylomela’s preferred food, results in a rather orange color tone. In general, however, it is a beautifully patterned, soft-bodied animal. (Overly n.d., Emore 2002, EOL n.d.(b))
An apomorphy that separates this taxon from its sisters is the presence of irregular black rings both on the inside and outside of the parapodia. On the dorsal surface of the mantle and parapodia, these black rings appear merely as irregular blotches (Emore 2002). However, the rest of the body of the organism is covered in more complete circles, which are connected together in an intricate pattern of black lines, accentuated every now and then with cream spots. (Emore 2002, EOL n.d.(b)).
Aplysia dactylomela’s internal shell, enclosed in the mantle, is highly reduced, flat, and fragile (Emore 2002, Bolland 2001). The consistency of cardboard, it is not sturdy enough to provide support for the animal itself (Overly n.d., University of Miami 2009). Thus, A. dactylomela is quite slug-like in appearance (University of Miami 2009). The shell is hypothesized to be the vestigial remnant of a shelled gastropod ancestor (Overly n.d., Bolland 2001). It does, however, function to cover the visceral mass, and mainly the heart and other essential organs located there (University of Miami 2009).
The foot is broad and well-developed, covering nearly the entire underside of the animal (Emore 2002, University of Miami 2009). Near the anterior end of the organism, the foot is rounded, while at the posterior end it comes down to a blunt point (Emore 2002). In contrast to the smooth texture of the rest of the body, it is quite rough (Emore 2002).
Next are the parapodia. An important distinguishing characteristic of A. dactylomela, these two large dorsal, wing-like extensions of A. dactylomela’s foot are part of the mantle, resembling long ears, such as those of a rabbit (Overly n.d.). Possibly more importantly, they have black markings on both the inside and outside, contrary to other species in the genus Aplysia (Rudman 1999). They are tough and leathery (Rudman 1999). Their location high on the animal and their thin thickness actually allows this animal to swim in the water column (Emore 2002).
Normally as an adult, this organism is nocturnal, and only goes through its slow movements after dark has set in. A controvertial topic to discuss about the sea hares is swimming. Although it is quite easy to mistake a sea hare that is simply floating down the water column after being released into the water, flapping its parapodia, for swimming, the organism is not. Whether or not this organism swims or cannot swim (the literature is unclear as to which is correct), A. dactylomela can look like it's swimming by first folding the parapodia forward and down, which creates a funnel that pulls in water. Then, by pressing the anterior parts of its parapodia together and forcing out the water behind itself, Aplysia dactylomela is propelled forward (Emore 2002).
Much more common than this swimming motion, however, is merely crawling along on the substrate at the bottom of the water. Also known as contractive wave motion, crawling is done by simply raising the leading edge of the foot and stretching it forward in a long, slow arching pattern. Much like an inchworm, the rest of the body follows until the tail of the organism is at last caught up to the rest of the body. Then, the process is repeated over again (Emore 2002).
Opisthobranchia literally means ‘Gills behind,’ referring to their place behind the heart of the organism. Located on the right side of the mantle right between the shell and the right parapodia, the gills are covered by the parapodia themselves. Through the use of a siphon (tube) modified from the mantle, water is channeled through the parapodia flaps and thus through the gills, allowing the animal to breathe (University of Miami 2009).
Another characteristic of the Opisthobranchia is their ability to ink. Believed to be a defense mechanism against predators, a purple dye is released when the Aplysia dactylomela is disturbed (Overly n.d., Tobach et al. 1989). This dye is an irritant to both invertebrates and fish (Nusnbaum 2010). From its preferred red algal food, pigments are extracted that both create the purple dye and make the organism’s flesh quite distasteful to predators (University of Miami 2009). The purple color of the ink is caused by the chemical aplysioviolin, a deterrant against predatory crabs, which does not function as an aposematic signal (Nusnbaum 2010).
Common among the Sea Hares are their rhinophores. These two antenna-like structures are located at the top of A. dactylomela’s head, and make the gastropod appear much like a rabbit with its long ears. These rhinophores, along with a pair of large anterior tentacles, which meet at the mouth, located on the underside of the head, are utilized as sense organs, having purposes such as locating food, other Aplysia, and even sensing danger. Directly in front of these rhinophores are A. dactylomela’s small, pinpoint black eyes. They aren’t very powerful, and don’t help the organism very much. Moreover, it relies heavily on its rhinophores and anterior tentacles to detect objects and conditions in its surrounding environment (University of Miami 2009).
Aplysia dactylomela can respond to its environment, and can be conditioned to respond to a stimulus in a certain way. A great example is its siphon withdrawal. When disturbed, A. dactylomela will pull its siphon back into its mantle cavity to keep it safe. This reaction can be induced through experience (touching the siphon), or through electrical shock (University of Miami 2009).
The Spotted Sea Hare exhibits three learning levels. The first is habituation. This is occurs when the organism’s responses decrease as a stimulus is repeatedly introduced to it. Second is sensitization. Nearly the opposite of habituation, the response of the organism is actually enhanced (grows stronger) as a harmful stimulus is repeatedly presented to the organism. Thirdly, this organism exhibits classical conditioning. At first, the Sea Hare is stimulated by both a siphon touch and a tail shock. Eventually, the tail shock is removed and the only stimulus the organism receives is a siphon touch, yet the same reaction still results (University of Miami 2009).
In addition, Aplysia dactylomela form into aggregations through a complex pattern. For one, they move toward a source of conspecific stimulation, and food and current stimulations also have an effect on the approach of the organism (Lederhendler 1977). One the other hand, however, no substance is released during copulation that would either attract or repel another sea hare (Lederhendler 1977).
Another interesting behavior is Aplysia dactylomela's preference of red algal food. Although it has been suggested that A. dactylomela ingests red algal food to extract molecules that aid in preventing predation of itself (Tobach et al. 1989), another interesting point is that mycosporine-like amino acids (MAA's), found in red algae, helps to protect A. dactylomela and its eggs from UV radiation, thus acting as a sort of sunscreen (Carefoot et al. 2000).
Thus, Aplysia dactylomela is a fairly large, soft-bodied, slug-like creature beautifully patterned with many pleasant green and brown color shades. Covered in irregular black rings, this organism can swim in the water column and crawl on the substrate, as well as respond to stimuli and defend itself against predators through its purple dye. It is through its rhinophores, which present the animal as having ears, that Aplysia dactylomela receives its nick-name, the Spotted Sea Hare.
Crestor is used for lowering high cholesterol and triglycerides in certain patients. It also increases high-density lipoprotein (HDL, "good") cholesterol levels. It is also used to slow atherosclerosis (narrowing of the arteries) in patients with high blood cholesterol levels. It is used along with an appropriate diet. Crestor is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, also known as a "statin." It works by reducing the production of certain fatty substances in the body, including cholesterol.
If you also take an antacid that has aluminum or magnesium in it, take it at least 2 hours after taking Crestor. Check with your doctor if you have any questions.
If you miss a dose of Crestor, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.
Store Crestor at room temperature, between 68 and 77 degrees F (20 to 25 degrees C). Store away from heat, moisture, and light. Keep Crestor out of the reach of children and away from pets.
Some medical conditions may interact with Crestor. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have any medical conditions, especially if any of the following apply to you:
if you are dehydrated or have certain muscle problems (eg, pain, weakness); have increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) blood levels; or have metabolism, hormonal, or electrolyte problems
Some medicines may interact with Crestor. Tell your health care provider if you are taking any other medicines, especially any of the following:
This may not be a complete list of all interactions that may occur. Ask your health care provider if Crestor may interact with other medicines that you take. Check with your health care provider before you start, stop, or change the dose of any medicine.
Crestor may cause dizziness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Crestor with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
Drinking alcohol daily or in large amounts may increase the risk of liver problems with Crestor. Check with your doctor before drinking alcohol while you are taking Crestor.
Tell your doctor or dentist that you take Crestor before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or surgery.
Women who may become pregnant should use effective birth control while taking Crestor. Check with your doctor if you have questions about using birth control.
Report any unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness to your doctor right away, especially if you also have a fever or general body discomfort.
Lab tests, including blood cholesterol levels, liver function, kidney function, and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) blood levels, may be performed while you use Crestor. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.
Use Crestor with caution in Asian patients and elderly patients; they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially serious muscle problems (eg, muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness).
Crestor should be used with extreme caution in children; safety and effectiveness in children have not been confirmed.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Do not use Crestor if you are pregnant. It may cause harm to the fetus. Avoid becoming pregnant while you are taking it. If you think you may be pregnant, contact your doctor right away. It is not known if Crestor is found in breast milk. Do not breastfeed while taking Crestor.
Severe allergic reactions (rash; hives; itching; difficulty breathing; tightness in the chest; swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue); chest pain; dark urine; joint pain; muscle pain, tenderness, or weakness (with or without fever or fatigue); pale stools; severe or persistent headache; stomach pain; swelling of the hands, ankles, or feet; yellowing of the eyes or skin.

First step to write short story is to understand five basic elements of it. Ten Tips, by our Chief Editor, for How to Write Short Stories are vivid explanation of these elements with easily understandable examples.
Before we jump to “How to Write Short Stories”, let us first have common understanding of what is short story and look closely what does compose a short story.
A short story is work of “fiction or imagination” that is usually written in “easily understandable grammatical structure” with “natural flow of speech”. Short story is meant to be read at single sitting and therefore it should be as direct and brief as possible. Because of directness and brevity, a typical short story has very little action and hardly any character development. However it must provide a snapshot of life – typically a decisive moment that may lead result lethal to the character in one or other form.
Confused? Not finding is easy? Relax… It is all about having a simple plot with preferably very few (one, two or maximum three) characters that directly and briefly touches the momentous part of life (by whatever manner but with “significant” effect). The ultimate finesse is making reader to say “Oh My God”, “Oh no”, “Poor xyz”, “Wow”, “Superb”, “YES… This I would have ALSO done”, “NO… This I would have NEVER done”…
Typically short story has five key elements – Character (fewer is better), Setting (brief but poetic and vivid), Plot (as simple and interesting as possible), Conflict (intense but one), and Theme (relating to majority of readers). These elements would become clearer subsequently in 10 Tips (2 per element) for How to Write Short Stories.
Let us check out these key elements in bit details along with examples and 10 tips – How to Write Short Stories – by our Chief Editor.
A character is someone or something that takes part in actions depicted in the short story. It could be a living person, a dead person, a ghost, an imaginary character, a robot, a dog, a toy… unlimited list. A character that is most related (mostly directly) to all actions depicted in the story is called protagonist or lead role. Other characters that closely participate in main action of the story for bit longer and/or more intense are main characters. Typically main characters are used to create conflict and resolve it. Few characters that may stay very short in story called supporting or side characters. These characters are primarily used for developing main characters, creating animated setting or heightening conflict (We shall discuss about conflict and setting in little while).
There are only two characters: first Wife – the protagonist, and second Husband the narrator – other main character. (Why not other way, that is, Husband as protagonist and wife as other main character?)
The golden rule for selecting characters in short story is “Fewer are better”. A short story would more effectively convey its meaning if it has very few characters – one protagonist, one other main character and no supporting or side characters would be ideal.
Which story in the above examples did you found easier to understand? Is your answer “Both”? Let’s demystify it in next tips for How to Write Short Stories. But once again remember the golden rule “Fewer characters are better”.
Animating character with perfect adjectives and examples are a must for connecting readers with the character; however, typically while writing short stories, do not fall in love with your character and overdo the characterization. (But in case you fall in love… Congratulations!!! Now it is time for you to write novel or drama). You need to muster all but only required characteristics and decorate them poetically – use appropriate adjectives, interesting dialogues, colourful descriptions, or even short-lived (in story) side characters. But again, remember, you are writing short story and therefore you need to be choosy in painting your characters – must use needed paints (to match your theme), and must do it fast (as short as possible).
Example 3: Let’s examine how writer developed “wife” character in our example short story Love Note after Twelve Years. Try…
What is theme? Selfless love finally gets recognition. Does story talk how beautiful she is? Does writer depict her to be good mom? How good does she cook? Is she in job or house maker? No information at all. Answers to these questions have nothing to do with our theme. But does she love her hubby? Is her love selfless? Yes. Whole story is about portraying these characteristics of her.
Example 4: But, on lighter note, what if theme of story itself is characteristics? Read this hilarious short story Howrah Rajdhani.
Time frame and place constitute setting of short stories. The setting is often decorated with descriptions of scenes such as super market, bedroom, crowded metro train, or drizzling evening… again unlimited list. These descriptions are very important to make reader immerse in the plot.
Example 5: Let’s re-examine all the three examples again to find out setting in these short stories. Note the duration or time frame of settings.
CrasSSSSSHHHHH…: One very busy day in office (at end, during climax setting changes to 3 months and then to 12 months in future)
Love Note after Twelve Years: A trip of couple of days, check-in in hotel and then at airport while returning
Howrah Rajdhani: Three-four hours from leaving house in auto-rickshaw to catching a train on railway platform
Unit of time frame may vary from hours to days to weeks to years. The golden rule in selecting time frame for short stories is “keep it shorter” and “have it single”. Short story that has setting of few hours may typically be clearer and more effective than with setting of few months or years.
Be very careful. It may turn fatal attempt for short story writing. Re-look your plot because both the requirements need dynamic setting that is NOT recommended for short stories. But if you are still convinced for longer time frame then remember two points: firstly, advance events in your story faster, and secondly, place important events almost at equal distance. If you need multiple time frames for your plot, for example many scenes of fifteen minutes of online chatting, structure it in chronological or reverse chronological order. Avoid crisscross transitions among time frames (even expert writer would avoid it). Further you must use signposts (for example subheadings with dates) or any other creative method to provide clear idea of the time frames and of the transitions among them to readers.
Example 6: Read this very touchy love story One in a million – REWIND that uses multiple timeframes of same units in reverse chronological order.
As a writer of short stories you must vividly describe surroundings. Here vivid description should not be misunderstood by predictable events and actions. You may choose to save few descriptions for climax but whatever you decide to disclose must be absolutely clear and very importantly be appealing to five senses of your readers. Be poetic, use suitable adjectives, script dialogues, or even deploy side characters… do whatever you need to ensure that the reader lives your story while reading.
Example 8: Read this heart touching philosophical short story Cycle of Life. Did you find yourself in “hospital setup” while reading it? Now read below two paragraphs: [1] has no description of setting where as [2] taken from the story has description of surroundings.
[1] A nurse guided us to a room where my best friend, my grandpa, was lying on a bed. My father was sitting sadly beside grandpa’s bed.
[2] A nurse guided us to a room. After a long week gap I saw my grandpa — my best friend. Grandpa was sleeping peacefully on hospital bed. There were many small TV and radio alike boxes with tiny lights. Few boxes were making “beep-beep” sound in rhythm. I knew that the sound was fading heart beats of my best friend — my grandpa. Then I saw my father, with red and swollen eyes, sitting closure to grandpa’s bed.
Plot is flesh and muscles of short stories. It comprises events and characters’ actions. More creatively you describe and logically connect the events and actions, stronger the plot would be; and stronger the plot you create, better interest would it generate among readers. A plot has start, body and end that are linked sequentially by events and character actions.
You must so choose a start that your reader gets hooked to the story. Now you may have question – how to do this? Well, answer is not so straight forward. You must know your readers well: what they like, what they speak, what surprises them, what arouses their interest… but finally it is your creativity. Nonetheless you must create confusion or question in readers’ mind by first line of your story. Your reader must try to get answer from best of her ability and experience but she should finally end up digging into subsequent lines of your stories to quench her temporarily aroused inquisitiveness.
[1] Do Not Kill My Love: “Kill him now. NOW or NEVER!!! … the only reparation of your ruined life” with these continuously resonating words in her mind, innocent looking Maria picked up chopper from the kitchen platform and started creeping towards bedroom where Alex, the wild horse, was sleeping naked after having a violently exhaustive sex with her, just few minutes back.
[2] One in a million – REWIND: From FEB 24 2010 17:46 – the REST OF MY LIFE: There I was, lost forever, trapped and without a choice, holding my head in one hand and the ring on the other.
Do not worry if you feel you still miss the punch in your first line. It comes with practice. Keep reading short stories… at least first line. (If you can leave a story after reading its first line only, then I would not recommend such first line for your story).
You need a tailor who will sew events and actions together in a meaningful and fashionable way in your story. Typically it should be one of the characters you choose – The Narrator of your story. Remember the narrator puts point of view from her or his or its perspective. Whose perspective would be better? It is not always perspective of protagonist that would make the plot better.
Example 10: Remember the question in Example 2 why not is husband protagonist in Love Note after Twelve Years? Husband is narrator of this story. The selfless love of wife would be presented more strongly if the person she loves presents it.
One more consideration while selecting suitable point of view is that the narrator can either support theme of story, oppose it, or present it neutrally. Any of these three styles is okay but I would recommend to choose a narrator that in general either directly would oppose the theme or act more to do so. If you prove or present the theme against the narrator’s actions or belief or dialogue, the plot would have very interesting and heightened climax suddenly surprising your reader by letting the narrator itself embracing the big change or accepting the defeat, in a way.
Depending upon what role narrator is playing in story, the plot would be written in first (I or We), second (You) or third (he, she, they…) person perspective.
Hmmm… Do you like conflict? YES or NO? If no, start liking it because conflict gives life to short stories. It is struggle between two sides of the theme of the story. Conflict can be between characters, thoughts, emotions, beliefs or anything that exists in this world in contrast. You typically find protagonist at one side of the conflict and on the other side it could be other important characters, society, or even supernatural powers. Sometime protagonist would be conflicting with itself such as contradictory thoughts or, even worse, alter ego as you read in Do Not Kill My Love.
Have you ever tried resolving a conflict either professionally or personally? If yes, you know it takes time and unfortunately you do not have time in short stories. Choose only one conflict around the central idea of the theme. What does bother your readers? Do you see something that is still not resolved? Can you create confusion by revealing something surprising? I am sure you would get many ideas around any theme by answering these questions but choose one that you can personally relate (something you were touched recently or intensely). Why? More you relate to conflict, better you can animate the settings and develop characters.
As we discussed, conflict gives life to short story, you must heightened the tension in your plot. Overcoming easy obstructions would not make your lead characters memorable. But, do not overdo it. Very rarely a superman would be liked in a short story. Even if you present a superhero on one side of conflict, you must show few “weakness” to make your story real.
So how to do it? Take a stand in beginning, make the stand dicey by posing sequence of actions against this stand, and just when both sides are “equally” fighting for superiority bring a “surprising” element that clearly makes your stand a winner or loser. That’s it.
[2] Love Note after Twelve Years: Selfless love, wife always takes care of husband’s wish but all of sudden it seems she forgets a very important file, but she kept it there… how selfish husband is to blame her? Wait… he changed himself by started believing that gift does matter to express love
Central idea or main belief presented by a short story is called theme. It is skeleton or frame of your short story that is decorated by plot, setting, conflict and characters. You may find myriad themes around you such as triumph of true love, honesty is best policy, God is great, tomorrow never comes, determination finally brings success, true love does not exist…
Every word in short story must be written for the theme therefore it is very important that theme is clear to you when you write story. Other elements of short stories – characters, settings, plot and conflicts – must tightly but comprehensively be tied to the theme. Be very careful not to be tempted to digress even slightly from the theme while writing short stories. You must heartedly decorate the setting and develop the characters but within narrow subject line as specified by the theme. Sometime, it may so happen that you may not be very sure of the theme while starting your story. No worry, in such case you determine the theme after completing the story and then critically chisel away extra flab that is not really needed for the theme of your short story.
This is most important tip for becoming a successful short story writer – write for yourself. Unleash your creativity without impounding it by any rule. If you feel to break any rule, do it. However reading these “Ten Tips for How to Write Short Stories” periodically, would help to hone short story writing skill instinctively. You should also use these “Ten Tips for How to Write Short Stories” as checklist to review your short story before submit it for any competition or publishing.

I recently upgrading ASP.NET MVC 2 solution from Visual Studio 2008 to Visual Studio 2010 (Ultimate Edition). I found that debugging was very slow. Depending on project size, it took around 30 seconds to initialize and another 5 seconds on each page request in my experience.
Changing default browser used in debugging ASP.NET MVC 2 is a bit tricky in Visual Studio 2010. To use ScottGu’s steps, you will need to add new ASPX page first. But unfortunately if you delete the page then close the application, anytime you rerun the application then the change you did will lost (it backs to use the default browser set in OS).
In my case I have Firefox set as my default browser but I need to use Internet Explorer as default browser for debugging. The trick I do is by doing these:
Set the Start Action to use Start external program and then pass the Internet Explorer executable path and the url as Command line arguments.
In my previous blog post I wrote that the requirement to enable multi-targeting feature in Visual Studio 2010 is .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 installed in the machine. But why does it not enable the Target Framework dropdown in File -> New -> Project / Web Site dialog of Visual Studio 2010 Express edition? Is multi-targeting not supported in Visual Studio 2010 Express edition?

Then paste it into the report and repeat for each image. On this site hit "go advanced" (if you've not already) and there'll be an option of "preview post" hit that and if the images show up you've nailed it, saves on loads of dead link replies in the thread

The information you share online – that is to say, your digital footprint – can have significant and often permanent impact on your reputation. Just ask POTUS. Too few individuals pause to consider the potential ramifications of a casually posted Tweet or Facebook comment.
Employers, opposing legal counsel, business competitors, and countless others may have an interest in monitoring your online activities.
In many cases, a single “slip up” is all it takes to give these parties the edge they need to discredit your good name. It’s not all about employers catching their employees behaving badly. Indeed, these concepts are true even if you’re the one doing the employing. Business owners will find themselves in hot water if discovered posting or sharing potentially discriminatory information. Employees should never be insulted or otherwise disparaged online.
Legal issues with your digital footprint can potentially be avoided by keeping in mind this smart rule of thumb: when online, act as though you were in public – because, essentially, you are.
In many cases you may feel anonymous when posting online. For example, you may participate in a discussion forum or have a Twitter account where you don’t use your real name. However, the reality is that in almost all situations this information can (and often will) be traced back to you. Operate under the assumption that this is always the case.
Did you know that many – perhaps most – apps on your smart phone or computer are, in some fashion or another, tracking what you do? Now your TV is watching you. On February 6, it was announced that some TVs are in on the covert surveillance. Vizio has agreed to pay $2.2 million for collecting viewing habits and selling the information to third parties. In some cases, apps with GPS functionality may even be tracking where you are. The things you post and the apps you use could be actively used against you in a legal situation. Far too many uninformed technology users have turned to the internet “just to vent” about their legal proceedings (e.g., a divorce or custody battle), which later resulted in a loss.
As a whole, social media and the Internet are wonderful tools which have given us the opportunity to learn, share, and connect with one another on a scale never seen before by humanity. However, it’s best to think of these things as a double-edged sword and to proceed with caution, deliberation, and an understanding of how these new technologies can impact our real-world lives.

I know I shouldn't do this but here goes again. I'm making plans for a trip lasting about six weeks.
We are again doing the Grand Tour put on by the Rose City Motorcycle Club of Portland, OR. This tour requires that you go to specified checkpoints and get your passbook stamped by local merchant that they have listed in the passbook. This is usually a local cafe or restaurant. Each year there are 19 checkpoints. Fifteen are in, or near, the state of Oregon. The other four are far, far away. This year the extra four are: Point Arena, CA (on the coast north of San Francisco), El Portal, CA (at the entrance to Yosemite NP), Springdale, UT (at the entrance to Zion NP) and Moran, WY (at the entrance to Grand Tetons NP). An entrant has from April 1st to Sept. 30 to complete as many as they can, in any order they wish. At the end of the October there is a dinner at which a drawing is held for prizes. Getting ten checkpoints gets an entrant one ticket in the drawing, 11 = 2, 12 = 3, 13 = 4, 14 = 5, all Oregon checkpoints equals 6 tickets. Then each of the distant checkpoints equals two tickets. The maximum is 14 tickets. We have never gotten them all but are planning on doing so this year.
As part of this trip we will be going to some places we have not seen before, Like Cabo San Lucas, BC Sur, Pikes Peak in Colorado and the Black Hills of South Dakota. All told we are planning on going over seven thousand miles in a big loop that gets the four distant checkpoints and some other sights.
Another thing we did was to buy a new tent and sleeping bag. The ones from our European trips were worn out!! We had spent over 400 nights in that camping gear and it had been set up and torn down over 350 times. That much usage had brought the price per night down to about one dollar each but put a lot of wear on it. We needed new gear before any more trips were started. We had bought the European set with lightness and compactness as the highest priority because we started the trip without a trailer. Everything was packed onto the bike. Now at home where we have constant access to our trailer and can consider more space and comfort. So we bought a six person tent with garage. My philosophy on tents is that they will actually only hold half, or less, of their rated capacity. Yes, you may actually be able to crowd that many sleeping bags onto the floor, but lets talk reality. Everybody has gear, clothes, toiletries, etc. that must also come into the tent. Room is needed for them too. So we bought a REI Hobitat 6 tent and its detachable garage. No the bike does NOT fit into the garage, but it makes a great place to sit out of the rain or sun without going into the tent.
Now you know the plan, check back to see if it works out or we again follow the poet Robert Burns that said: The best-laid schemes o’ mice an’ men Gang aft agley,

5. Triple jumper Arpinder Singh created history by becoming the first Indian to win a medal in the IAAF Continental Cup.
I was listening to a man talk about what he calls “magic.” What he calls magic we might call spiritual gifts and natural law.
While listening to his conversation what struck a chord with me was when he said that some people will do what is suggested with “magic” to bring about something, it happens, and afterwards they begin to feel they are “special.” Special because they now can do something that many others can’t or don’t know how to do. He cautioned those who have such experiences, telling them to make sure they stay humble. These experiences really don’t make you “special.” He suggested caution because he has seen others who begin to feel they are special that turn dark and get into what he called “black magic.”
The chord it struck was how this same phenomenon also happens to some who experience a spiritual gift or have a spiritual event in their life. Said event might frighten them at first, but soon they become accustomed to having the gift and start feeling they are the gift. After that a little shard of ego might enter the equation and it can go south real quickly. We might call it using spiritual gifts for evil, self-aggrandizement, obtain a following, or to control others.
Years ago I had invited one of the two redeemed people I have talked about to come and speak at our restaurant. We’d have about 15 people come and eat dinner with a speaker and then listen to them share whatever they felt to share. He was an invited guest. After dinner we had a wonderful time with him and he did a question and answer session for those there.
Later, after the event was over, a real good friend who had wonderful spiritual gifts came up to me and said, “He’s intimidated by me.”
“I intimidate him. That’s why he didn’t answer some of my questions,” she answered back. My friend went on to tell me that she knew it was her spiritual gifts that had intimidated him.
I told her that he is a practicing attorney and has argued law in front of many courts, some at a very high level, so I don’t see how he would be intimidated by a “gifted person.” Even more wonderful, he had received the Lord Jesus Christ, the Second Comforter, and therefore had been in His physical presence, so I doubted her spiritual gifts and her presence had intimidated him.
Sometimes our egos explode and we really do think we are important, don’t we. As you well know from our past writings, I’ve been there, done that, and bought the t-shirt.
As I thought about this today, I was reminded of other individuals that seem to have done the same thing. One man I interacted with on many occasions whose veil had dropped while on his mission has started his own church where he is the head “guru.” Another man I interacted with on several occasions and was quite gifted also started his own church, where he declared himself to be the head Apostle. One of the most gifted women I have met, who has since passed on, saw how her gifts intimated those around her. She started a business with a group of people. If anyone disagreed with what she was doing she would loudly declare, “Thus sayeth the Lord,” and then declare the message God was giving her. Her followers cowered and obeyed her declarations. After all, she spoke with God!
I call what this woman did, “Using the God card.” It is when someone uses their gifts to intimidate in order to be obeyed. Many are so intimidated or “impressed” by the gifted they immediately believe and obey. That is what I have loved about one woman. In all our workshops she has always told the attendees to never believe her. They are asked to go home and ask God the Father about every concept taught, reminded that she is human and makes mistakes. If you try to follow or worship her, you will not be treated very nice, which is one way of getting rid of you and what you are doing. Her main desire is to do His will. Another woman I know used the “God card” on me once and I told her quite forcefully to never use that on me. From that moment she decided we are not friends. Her choice, not mine.
I’ve been around more than a few people that are self-declared “channelers”, meaning they go into a trance state and make contact with a being on the other side of the veil. That being then teaches you through them. I had one such person who channels tell me what Enoch wanted me to know about establishing Zion. The person gave me a paper with a list of ten or twelve “Business Principles of Zion” on it that had been channeled. I gave it to a gifted one and all she said was, “They don’t do business in Zion. Where did this come from?” Meaning, what source did it come from, light or dark? There is actually an evil being named “Source.” Well, if they don’t do business in the real Zion, where would it have come from? You tell me. Did the biblical Enoch really channel this through that person? Should I spend my time listening to such individuals? I have heard that some people that channel have large followings and exude quite a bit of influence over them. How sad. Maybe we should follow the Lord Jesus Christ instead, learn to “channel” (hear) Him, and let Him exude His influence over us. Just a thought.
How come some people when they receive spiritual gifts suddenly feel so special? Why do we make them gurus? I watched this phenomenon for years with people making my daughter a guru. They would come to the house and ask her to tell them what they should do with their life. Why do some gifted make themselves gurus? I believe therein lies the danger. When we begin to think we are someone special, then the ego kicks in. We can become prideful. Is that why some gifted seek others to work on? What is inside the person whose gift of sight comes in and now wants to walk up to others telling them what is on them, or wrong with them? “You don’t look so well, can I work on you?” I lived with a sighted person and she would never tell me much. If I asked, she would tell me to go ask Christ. You’ve read the stories in the books. She would let me live through my experiences and just observe, not stepping on my agency. Many times she laughed and laughed about the dumb things I did. “Denise, why didn’t you tell me I had demons on me? You’re my daughter! Why did you allow me to suffer?” I’d ask her. “I’m not supposed to tell you, that would go against your agency and ruin the lesson Christ wanted you to learn,” she’d answer back.
What I’m saying is we might want to be cautious. Cautious with ourselves when our gifts come in and extremely cautious with others that are gifted. Making them our personal guru, or following them only makes us a candidate for the Telestial kingdom. All praise and honor goes to our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, not to one of these mortals roaming this planet with us, no matter how gifted they are. We are here to learn about and become like our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, and no one else. What is amazing is that He has no ego. None. Yes, those with gifts are here to help others, but only when He so states and only in His way. If we step outside those bounds, we can then become “special” to another being, one of a very dark nature.
Though I did meet a “special” person once that was quite gifted and of much light. I was having lunch with my redeemed friend when a young man with Downs Syndrome came up to us. He gave my friend a hug and then looked at me. He smiled and came to my side of the table and gave me a hug. My friend told me the young man is in his ward and sees spiritually. He has watched this young man enter the chapel in their church, look at some individuals and walk around to the other side of the building to get back into the chapel. Those individuals were spiritually dark and this young man wouldn’t go near them. He wasn’t judging them, he just didn’t want to get near them. My friend laughed and said I must be okay because this young man hugged me.
Now that young man is what I’d call special. Spiritually sighted, no ego, seeks no following, with only love to share.

Embarking on a much anticipated leave from work, with the intention of reviving my creative life, I have instead been plunged into the reality of supporting my husband through surgery for cancer. Coincidentally I had promised to do some work for ‘The Great Apron Show’ planned by Carol Ruff at Gallery East, and had procured a new (old) sewing machine that I was keen to try out (an ancient Bernina!). Having not sewn anything from scratch for many years, this has been a therapeutic exercise, replete with dusting off old embroidery skills (ok, not that skilful!). For the aprons I used vintage tea towels and other old fabric scraps sourced in op shops, and added some pithy and flippant feminist quotes.
The idea of women’s domestic work as Art seems a dated feminist trope for those like me who went to art school in the seventies. The development of women’s voices was a distinct movement in the 70s and 80s in Australia, with Vivienne Binns as matriarch. I recall that in 1974, my first year at art school, I made patchwork clothes as an artwork on the theme of ‘the space where I live’. The patchwork fabric used pieces of curtains and other soft furnishings, made into items that I could wear (skirt and jacket). Goodness knows how my mother felt about me taking scissors to my bedroom furnishings, but at art school they felt that the work was terribly mundane and it was not approved. In retrospect my problem was that at 18 I did not have the words or the confidence to describe my intentions, but my feelings about the importance and invisibility of women’s work were central. I can’t help thinking that a few years later they may have seen the work differently.
Working on my aprons has been wonderfully therapeutic – keeping my hands and mind busy without the pressure of producing ‘serious’ art. Also reviving some erstwhile skills – in the 70s and 80s I made many of my own clothes, as girls did back before the days of cheap Bangladeshi labour. It is heartening to see ‘handmade’ touted as a key value for the young and hip, and I’m really looking forward to seeing the great apron show!

A number of problems on the inelastic stability of biaxially loaded columns were solved by utilizing an incremental approach. The matrix of influence coefficients, referred to herein as the tangent stiffness matrix, varies with the loading and depends upon the penetration of yielding across the section, the magnitude of external loads, and the displacements of the column. The matrix must therefore be revised with each increment of load, and during each cycle of iteration. Successive corrections are made until the condition of equilibrium between the internal and external forces is satisfied. The analysis covered two different types of loading, proportional and nonproportional. The influences of material yielding, residual stress, end warping restraint, end bending restraint, and initial imperfection were included. The problems of centrally loaded columns and lateral-torsional buckling of beam-columns were also examined by using the biaxial bending theory and the concept of initial imperfection.
Retailers from small to large in San Francisco are realizing how they can drive sales using retail mobile marketing tools including mobile apps for retailers, mobile websites for retailers and retail SMS marketing. Sears has invested tens of millions of dollars expanding their mobile marketing for retailers program to build what they have dubbed an “integrated retail experience.”
Sears’ mobile marketing program uses all elements of mobile and social marketing to “holistically go after the customer.” Before implementing the program, Sears researched their customer base, sought feedback and mined data using their rewards program.
While Sears has spent millions, your small business can launch a strategy for mobile marketing for retailers for just a few dollars. Continue Reading

SMS text marketing is being used by many businesses around the San Francisco, including retailers, restaurants and nightclubs. Church and text messages may not seem like they belong together, but churches are also getting in on the benefits of SMS text marketing.
Church can be big business. Churches collectively receive millions, even billions, of dollars annually from their members. Much of this money is fed back into the community through aid and donations to the poor, help for the homeless, and other worthy causes.
SMS text message marketing is one way to gather more donations and make church members aware of happenings in the church and community. Continue Reading

Lawyers for both Florida Democratic candidates Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson fought on Friday night to allow non-United States citizens' votes to be included in the 2018 midterm election results.
It is hard to see how arguments that President Trump cannot appoint Matthew Whitaker as acting attorney general, because even temporary top positions must be Senate-confirmed, could be correct. Otherwise the Constitution could deprive the nation of a functioning government every time a new party wins the presidency while the opposition party holds the Senate.

They don't use the term "Seamless Garment" much anymore. The invention of flamboyantly pro-gay and left-wing Cardinal Joseph Bernadin, that phrase lost its luster the fiftieth time some pro-choice Irish- or Italian-American politician used it to burnish his Catholic credentials during a campaign. To hide her support for killing children to suit our sexual convenience behind the promise of more cash for Medicaid, or extra food stamps.
Here’s how Wikipedia spins this leftist, pacificist Catholic movement, in its softball entry on the topic:
The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles that value the sacredness of human life.
In practice, this rhetoric serves people in high positions at rich Catholic organizations that claim pro-life credentials. They insist that you can't oppose intentionally killing children, unless you also sign on to a very long list of very specific policies. Which always somehow turn out to be leftist. To grow the federal government. To garner hundreds of millions of dollars for left-wing, nominally Catholic groups such as Catholic Charities or Catholic Relief Services. (Last year, forty percent of the U.S. Catholic bishops conference budget came from such taxpayer-funded contracts.) To cast Uncle Sam as a messiah who will dry every tear, and wipe each runny nose.
These people have cast about for a new, less tainted phrase to use to describe themselves. Some tried to steal "Whole Life" from my old friend Jason Jones. He coined the term to mean comprehensive respect for human rights and dignity. Not, you know, a laundry list of free stuff and services for bored government employees (or Catholic contractors) to dole out to future voters.
Others use the term "consistent life ethic." They strive to seem holistic, and to cast those of us who actually want to, you know, outlaw abortion, as single-issue cranks. We're not sophisticated, you see. We don't want to get to the root of the problems underlying abortion. We just want to treat the symptoms.
That was the message of self-styled "New Wave Feminist" Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa, when she jumped on the doomed campaign of Robert Francis "Beto" O'Rourke for Senate. She went so far as to endorse the 100 percent pro-choice candidate just a few days before a close election. Here was her logic:
This idea of eliminating abortion by simply making it illegal is far too low of a bar to set. Abortion must become unthinkable and unnecessary if we want to eradicate it from our culture. And the only way that will happen is by creating a post-Roe culture while Roe still stands.
Abortion becomes unnecessary when women have so much support from within their community that the one violent choice never even becomes an option in their minds. Abortion becomes unthinkable when women of color realize that having their children will not cost them their own lives because we have men like O’Rourke actually addressing the disproportionate number of minorities and children dying during childbirth.
You want women to stop feeling pressured into abortion? Then start by addressing the very things that lead so many of them to that desperate choice in the first place.
I've dismantled arguments like hers before. Rather than repeat myself, let me point you to just one piece. Okay, maybe just two.
I'll assume for the purpose of argument that De La Rosa is sincere. That unlike Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and R.F. "Beto" O'Rourke, she actually opposes abortion. Thinks that it's killing. And I'll pose some questions for people like her to try and answer for themselves.
Would you have tut-tutted at Abolitionists who wanted to outlaw slavery? Told them they were fixated on merely a surface problem? That we should leave slavery legally in place, while working for a world where it was not illegal but "unthinkable"? Would you have focused government efforts not on forcibly freeing slaves, but compensating slave-owners? Or importing new cheap, free labor -- to take away the "root cause" of slavery, as in the need to have someone cut the cotton cheaply? Would you have demanded we root out racism first, before passing the 13th Amendment?
The favorite argument of Seamless Garment workers is that there are many, many "life issues" of equal weight to abortion. The almost implausibly witless Cardinal Blaise Cupich of Chicago made such a claim. In fact, he greeted the news that Planned Parenthood sells baby parts for profit with the following gem of moral analysis.
[W]e should be no less appalled by the indifference toward the thousands of people who die daily for lack of decent medical care; who are denied rights by a broken immigration system and by racism; who suffer in hunger, joblessness and want; who pay the price of violence in gun-saturated neighborhoods; or who are executed by the state in the name of justice.
So we can't condemn human organ traffickers unless... we adopt the Cardinal's solutions to a very long list of other problems. We have to offer limitless free medical care, at taxpayer expense. Open the borders to all comers. Solve racism. Eliminate all economic inequality. Take every citizen's guns. And stop executing murderers. Only once we've met every demand on that ransom note will the Cardinal agree that we can't kill babies. Huh.
Would you have focused government efforts not on forcibly freeing slaves, but compensating slave-owners?
I don't think he goes far enough. Don't we have to solve climate change? Eliminate misogyny in the Muslim world? End human-trafficking? Cure cancer?
Those affect human life too. In fact, every single political issue does. That's why we argue about politics.
Is there any issue trivial enough that people like De La Rosa wouldn't consider it equal to killing babies? Wouldn't say that we need to embrace government coercion and redistribution to solve it first? If so, I wish she would name that issue.
De La Rosa seems pretty sure she knows what lies at the root of abortion. It's economic deprivation. But is that really true? Because I have another theory. Are you ready?
It seems to me that abortions happen because sexual intercourse is pleasant. But it sometimes results in pregnancy. And men are naturally (as feminists endlessly tell us) inclined to pressure women for sex without commitment. But they don't always want to man up. To support the women they impregnate, at least financially. Our culture blasts the rather obvious message "Sex is fun" into our heads almost 24/7. Groups that target children like Planned Parenthood encourage sexual experimentation (and ample perversions) at ever younger ages. Churches that discourage premarital sex get constantly ridiculed, and harassed by the government.
Maybe the root cause of abortion is ... men pressuring women for sex. And women saying "yes" when they should mean "no."
Do you want to dig down that far, and fix that problem at the root? Maybe by promoting chastity? Enforcing child support more ruthlessly? Banning porn? Promoting marriage?
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson joined Breitbart News Saturday to discuss his recent tour of the New England Center and Home for Veterans in Boston. “It’s been really fantastic being able to work for an agency that spends so much of its time and effort focused on veterans,” Secretary Carson told Breitbart News Deputy Political Editor Amanda House. “Less than one percent of our population protects the other 99 percent. It allows us to be able to live in peace and safety.” Carson spoke about his experience speaking with the veterans. “I had heard that the center in Boston was doing a particularly good job of getting the veterans who, in many cases, are chronically homeless, off the streets. I wanted to go for myself and see what they were doing, actually talk to some of the veterans,” Carson said. “It was so wonderful actually talking to some of them.” Secretary Carson then discussed the progress being made to assist homeless veterans. “Over the last year, we do a point-in-time assessment every January. We’ve gone down more than five percent in veteran homelessness across the country,” Secretary Carson stated. “So we’re making tremendous progress. It’s the kind of

In response to taunting by President Trump, Senator Elizabeth Warren reached for what might reasonably be considered objective proof for her claim of Native American ancestry: a DNA test. Warren is either a descendant of Native Americans, or she is not. The answer is written in her genetic material, and science allows us to discover it.
As it turned out, Senator Warren's DNA test did confirm her distant Native American ancestry. And while partisans may bicker over whether such a tiny trace of heritage is worth mentioning, no one appears to dispute the conclusiveness of DNA evidence to resolve the question.
Of course, DNA has long been used to reveal data about one's identity. We use it in paternity testing. We use it to identify criminals and to diagnose genetic diseases. So it's not surprising that we would use it to determine one's ethnic background.
And yet, a popular cultural trend would have us ignore or reject this heretofore unassailable source of objective data when it comes to sex and gender. They would have us understand sex (a word they rarely use) and gender not as facts that transcend human will and emotion, but rather as fluid aspects of an identity one can embrace or reject.
In the absence of some limiting principle, we should expect unfettered growth in the category of facts that we are asked to pretend are merely conventions. According to the new worldview, it is only by throwing off the hindrance of our reason and knowledge that we can enjoy absolute freedom to be whoever or whatever we want to be. This power to define one's self is the essential goal.
A couple of years ago, the Family Policy Institute of Washington sent Joseph Backholm, a white male, onto a college campus to observe students' responses to certain claims he made about his own identity. The video footage is jaw-dropping.
Asked how they would respond if Backholm told them he was actually a woman, there was a fairly consistent, "Fine. Nice to meet you!" Similarly, students didn't seem disturbed by the idea of Backholm calling himself Chinese. One young lady responded, "Good for you! Be who you are!"
There was a detectable shift in their responses -- both verbal and non-verbal -- as Backholm's claims became increasingly easy to disprove with objective data. Students were obviously more uncomfortable agreeing that Backholm could be 7 years old. And yet, we painfully witness their efforts to deny blatant realities in order to support Backholm in identifying himself however he likes. "If you feel 7 at heart, then so be it. Good for you!"
Some students appeared to hit the breaking point when five-foot, nine-inch Backholm declared that he was six feet, five inches tall. But the indoctrination of others into the truthless worldview has been so complete that they were willing to accept even that. "If you truly believe it, I think that's fine. I wouldn't tell you you're wrong. It's not my place."
What is to become of a society whose people lack the fortitude to tell each other they are wrong about a mathematical measurement -- let alone about issues of morality? And what of "speaking truth to power?"
Common among many of the college students' responses was the phrase, "I feel like:" "I feel like that should be an o.k. thing;" "I feel like that's not my place to say another human is wrong."
But notice that what is being described is not a feeling at all. The idea that one person shouldn't say another person is wrong is not an emotion. It is a belief. A conviction.
By couching statements like these in terms of our "feelings," we subtly shield them from analysis or evaluation. We can argue about whether it is right to challenge an unsubstantiated ancestry claim. But arguing about one's feelings serves little purpose.
Conservatives must reject these efforts to shroud the world of facts beneath feelings. Any girl can say that she "feels like" a boy. But male-ness is not a feeling. It is a fact that can be proven or disproven, just like ancestry, paternity or ethnicity, by DNA. And truth does not conform itself to human feelings or fantasies.
It is an audacious hypocrisy for "progressives" to run to DNA for proof of facts that suit them (ethnicity) while denying its relevance when its proofs are at odds with their own feelings or desires (sex/gender). But it is also an implicit acknowledgement that, try as we might, we cannot escape from objective reality; we will never succeed in escaping Truth.

Waiting for Celtic game to start, thought i'd watch first 30 mins of rangers v hearts game, first goal looked very, very offside to me.
Absolutely pish, we couldn't score in a brothel, this is going to be a very long campaign, for those of you who thought we'd stroll the league, think again!
I said the same and was told "away to bed" don't hear the same wallopers passing comment now on us strolling the league!
I watched the game with 7 neutral Aussie mates, at the end they asked, why is such a gulf in teams allowed?
They were the same old crap team with a different label. Gerrard reminds me of a politician with his useless soundbites. let's go lol.
I am sure he must have swatted up on several back issues of Roy of the Rovers and then had his dream shattered when the players HE had did not perform the way his imagination thought they would.
Very poor loser but, if nothing else, showed that he had the class to match the accepted and expected standards of being connected to sevco.
Been the longest build up to an orgasm ever, they've been saying they're coming for years but still nothing.
The guy is just there to conduct the choir and fire-up the gullibles playing the 'everyone's against us' card in the blame-game.
The gulf in class, ability, skill and confidence was there for all to see and the only thing that was misleading was the scoreline.
To highlight the Rogic 'foul', while ignoring the red card offence from his goalie, the impotency of his forwards, and the match stats in every aspect of the game, just proves he's a snake-oil peddlar.
All this may I add to deflect from one of poorest starts to a season by TRIFC 2012 - five points from four games, but the person Media will not want to address that or question their latest Messiah.
We made them look like a juniors side, the predicted high balls which our defence handled with ease, when they tried to play it out from the back they looked lost.
You too DUB; Collum, McGregor (who should have been sent off) and the bar and post saved Sevco from another hammering. 1-0 going on 7.
goals aside they were just as far behind as ever. let's get some positive energy going now and get back top spot.
Speaking as a bhoy who now lives in Australia, young Arzani will find our winters very hard to cope with, Aussies hate the cold, but Rogic has Aclimatised. I think he will be a good option for us.
I totally agree with you mate, I was hoping to see Ralston get a run of games, I know Lustig is a model pro but he wouldn't be human if he didn't have one eye on staying injury free for the World Cup.
Totally agree 4leaf, love lustig but father time is catching him, gets caught out of position too much these days.

On July 17 2010 I realized that clans should not be about looks alone, but about pure skill. I realized this when T$hit leader SniPE_U said he knew I had skills but he wanted my rank and kdr to get better before he would let me in the clan. If he knew I had skill why not let me in there and then. If someone is good they should not be judged on their stats but their ability. This is what Armed Rangers is going to do, we are looking for players good on any maps we do not care about rank or kdr, true skill will be found and posers will be stopped for we are Army Rangers.

Nice idea! I love how you are trying something new. Because sometimes KDR can get screwed up when you are a beginner and then, when you get good, you are judged to be not so great. That is why i made a new file when i got good.

We believe that there is one true and living God who exists eternally in three equally divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus), and God the Holy Spirit. We believe that God has revealed himself authoritatively in the bible.
We believe that the Bible, consisting of all sixty-six books of the old and new testaments, is the Holy Spirit inspired word of God, is without error in the original manuscripts, is what God has declared about himself and his eternal purposes, and is the supreme and final authority for testing and determining what is true and right.
We believe that all have sinned and are justly under the wrath of God by nature and choice. We believe that Jesus lived a perfectly righteous and sinless life, that he suffered and died in our place on the cross to fully absorb the wrath of God and pay the just penalty for our sins, that he was buried, and that he rose from the dead. We believe that all those who repent from their sin and put their faith in Christ receive grace to be forgiven, cleansed, and fully reconciled to God as his children. We believe that Jesus is the only way to the Father, the author and finisher of our faith, and that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone. We believe that the gospel is of first importance and is to be preached to believers and unbelievers.
We believe that those in Christ, have been saved from the penalty of sin (justification), are being saved from the power of sin (sanctification), and we will be saved from the presence of sin (glorification).
We believe that the church is God’s primary means of earthly activity and kingdom advancement. We believe that every believer in the entire world, both living and dead, became a part of the church universal as soon as they put their faith in Christ, and that every living believer is to express that reality thru commitment and submission to a specific, biblically based, local church.
We believe that churches are most commonly planted by apostles, built on the foundation of apostles and prophets, led by a plurality of biblically qualified male elders (shepherds, pastors), and equipped for the work of the ministry by apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers. We believe that church leaders are given authority by God for building people up and that the people of God are called to obey and submit to them so long as those leaders are leading in accordance with the bible. We believe that godly leadership is to be marked by Christ likeness and self-sacrificial service.
We believe that the church is God’s primary missions strategy to expand and advance his kingdom in the earth and to make disciples who make disciples of all people groups. We believe that missions should either be a new church plant by an apostle led team of people including some who possess the biblical qualifications of an elder that is sent by a local church, or a person or team of people sent by the church to strengthen, help, or encourage an already existing church.
We believe that every person who puts their faith in Christ should be baptized in water by immersion, not for salvation, but as an outward expression of an inward gospel transformation.
We believe that those who are in Christ should regularly remember the Lord and proclaim his death thru the Lord’s Supper, by eating the bread and drinking the cup together with other believers.
We believe that the baptism and continual filling of the Holy Spirit is available as a gift to all believers in Christ for service, gospel witness, boldness, power, and the spiritual gifts. We believe that all the spiritual gifts are necessary and should be eagerly desired by all believers for the building up of the church.
We believe that Jesus rules and reigns over everyone and everything, everywhere, for all time and eternity. We believe that his kingdom is unrivaled, uncontested, and is to be sought first. We believe his kingdom has come, is coming, and will come in fullness when he returns.
We believe that God alone is within Himself glorious, that He reveals His glory through His Son, and that the chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever.
We believe that God speaks to his people and that his sheep hear his voice. We also believe that God will never speak anything that is contrary to the word of God and that all hearing should be tested with the word of God.
We believe that God has sovereignly chosen to partner with his people to release his will on earth as it is in heaven through prayer, and that his people are to be devoted to prayer. We believe that prayer is a means of grace for communion with God, for warfare against Satan and sin, for the effectualness of gospel mission, and for the building up of the church.
We believe that human life begins at conception and should be honored and esteemed regardless of age, race, ethnicity, or gender.
We believe that God created all things by his will, and that all things were created through him and for him, that in everything He might be preeminent. We believe that God created all things, so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to rulers and authorities in the heavenly places. Therefore, the world was created by God to provide a context for the display of himself, that the nations may know that he is the Lord, that his glorious grace might be praised, and that all things might be summed up in Jesus Christ.
We believe that the devil is our enemy and that we are in a battle with him and his demons: the rulers, authorities, cosmic powers over this present darkness, and spiritual forces of evil in heavenly places. We believe that Jesus disarmed them by triumphing over them on the cross, but that a person can give the devil a foothold or a stronghold through unforgiveness, unrepented sin, believing lies, unbelief, rebellion, or occultic involvement. We believe that those who are in Christ have divine power to demolish such strongholds and to be free in Christ. We believe that it is often helpful and/or necessary for the direct, authoritative, prayers of other believers to obtain such deliverance and freedom.
We believe that men and women are created equal in the image of God, with different but complimentary roles. We believe that the value of a man or woman is not derived from or determined by his or her role. We believe that in the church the elders are to be men and that in the family the head of a wife is her husband.
We believe that marriage is a life-long covenant between one man and one woman where God joins the two together and makes them one. We believe that the exclusive place for sex is between a husband and a wife in the context of marriage.
We believe that God hates divorce and that what God has joined together, man should not separate. We also believe that some instances of remarriage are referred to in the bible as adultery, and that if a person cannot specifically determine what instances the bible is referring to when it speaks of remarriage as adultery, then it is also not possible for that person to determine what instances of remarriage are not adultery.
We believe that the practice of homosexuality is a sin and that those in Christ who are tempted to practice homosexuality have sufficient grace and power to resist temptation and in some cases to be delivered from same sex attraction all together.
We believe that the everlasting covenant which God made with Abraham has Christ at its center, but that it does not dissolve the plan of God for the people and land of Israel. There are not two peoples of God, but rather one body in Christ, made up of Jews and Gentiles. However, the promises made to Israel in the bible are still in force, and will one day be fulfilled when the whole house of Israel is grafted into the people of God again. The church has not replaced Israel, nor is it the “new Israel.” It has been grafted into the faith by the king of Israel. Hence, we have a calling, not only to the Gentiles, but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel to preach the gospel and pray for their salvation, and to look with faith to the day when all Israel shall be saved.
We believe that when those who are in Christ die, their spirits are made perfect and they are taken into paradise to be with Christ, there to await the resurrection of the righteous. Following the final tribulation, Jesus will physically and visibly return to this earth to execute judgment upon unbelievers, to raise imperishable those who are in him, and to establish his global kingdom reign upon the earth from Jerusalem. At the end of his millennial reign will come the final judgment of the wicked, Satan and his hosts, and of death itself. They will go into eternal punishment in the lake of fire. After this, the new heaven and the new earth will be revealed to the glory of God and the everlasting joy of His people, and all things will be summed up in Christ.
Just to give you an idea of how out of whack things were, the Thompson River was nearly 4000 cfs six days ago, and now is less than 1500 cfs as of today. The river is clearing, but is still not ready for the epic Salmon Fly hatch. The water temp was 43 degrees today. The word on the street is that the water temp needs to be between 48 to 58 degrees for the giant Salmon Flies to hatch. I am not sure about the water temps, but I do know that the Salmon Fly hatch is hard to predict across the state of Montana. many have called me in the past week to get the info on the Thompson River.
The Salmon Fly hatch is one of the best hatches in Montana. Anglers come from all over the world to have a chance to catch a trout on a two to three inch dry fly. The trout love them. Anglers have the chance to catch a 24 inch native non-stocked trout on this fly.
On the Thompson River, located in Thompson Falls, Montana; the Salmon Fly Nymphs have started moving to the banks and are ready for the hatch. Like all stone flies, the larger Salmon Fly crawls out of the the water and molts and spreads itʼs wings and flutters across the water laying its eggs. They are much more active than the Skwala Stone Fly. The term “TWITCH IT” is uttered by all the guides to the clients that have never fished with the Salmon Fly. The more action the better the results.
The Thompson River Clean Up is this weekend. It starts at 9:00 am and runs all day. If you want to try your luck with the Nymph pattern of the Salmon Fly this would be a good time to do it. When things slow down you can give back to the Thompson River by picking up some trash and packing it out. We all have to pitch in to keep America and Montana Beautiful. So Please come to Thompson Falls this weekend and fish the Thompson River. While your at it pick up a few empty beer cans and other trash.
If you are interested in a guided fly fishing trip on the Thompson River please contact me at 406-210-0971 or visit our website www.montanafishingcompany.com

There is no silver bullet when it comes to generating income in a business so that we can pay our employees and ourselves a living wage.
To build a business, there is no other way than working very hard for our goals whatever they may be. One “catch phrase” that has stuck with me through the many ups and downs of running our business is Passive Income.
It is cash flow that comes in whether we are working or not. One would hope that the retirement fund, if we have one, would represent a form of passive income. Though, with today’s economy along with the taxes we would pay on that income in the long run there really are questions about its viability as a retirement fund in the first place.
Now, obviously passive income does not grow on trees. Otherwise, the beaches in nice places like Fiji, Tahiti, and the like would be filled with umbrella drink sipping folks.
One thing to keep in mind is that once the garden is planted, that does not mean the work is over. It takes a lot of work to come through the growing season with a good yield of fruits and vegetables.
There is not a lot of difference between that garden and working a business in this industry or any other for that matter.
Many have jumped on the Managed Services delivery platform as a way to generate their passive income. The catch to MSP is to balance the value the client receives with the income we receive. That can be a tough balance to catch if we are not experienced enough in our business dealings, hardware support, software support, or have an experienced team around us to come up with some solid costs for the 12 month or longer MSP contract with the client.
So, once we came up with the magic number, the next step was to convince our clients that MSP was the best way to go. In our case, we focus our attentions on the professional accounting industry. It was not hard to see that calculator going in the partner’s heads when we first proposed the MSP model and fees to them.
Needless to say that in our case, we ended up doing a blended Managed Services model with a tiered structure that our accounting clients worked with us on to provide the best value for them and for us.
Now, we are slowly working our way through the various MSP and related products out there to augment our services offering to provide more value for that monthly fee.
We have a partnership with OWN as a Services Provider. We are slowly moving our clients over to ExchangeDefender and now are talking to key clients about Hosted Exchange and SharePoint.
One key feature to OWN is the true partnership relationship they have with us. We will never find OWN in our client’s inbox direct selling their services.
The other very important feature to reselling OWN services is that passive income. We do the leg work to bring our clients on board, we get to invoice them monthly as part of our managed services offering, and Vlad and his crew get to do all of the hard work for us. ;)
Establishing business partnerships with service providers like OWN will be the butter to our Hybrid MSP services hardware and software bread as we move forward.
Ultimately, we get to offer a nice suite of services without having to spend the hundreds of thousands of dollars to provide our clients with some sort of SLA. It is a win-win situation to be in!
I’ve assigned homework once this semester. That was Geometry. In Algebra, I’m not sure I’ve assigned any. I rarely talk about this particular paragraph of my personal Manifesto du Education, simply because, unlike assessment reform, for example, this has always felt a bit disgraceful.
So here it is, and don’t expect this one to surface Whack-A-Mole-style like this again for a long time:
The kids who need it most (D and F students), won’t, or else they’ll do it halfassedly, gaining as much credit with the least effort possible.
This goes double for high-poverty students, where I performed a Master’s thesis study that concluded as much.
In that study, incidence of cheating rose significantly in the experimental group. Assessment scores, meanwhile, demonstrated statistically insignificant improvement. My class’ disposition towards learning (and math, particularly) took a nosedive. When I surveyed my students, few of them connected homework to practice, only to the points.
There were students in the C-range whose comprehension improved with daily practice but this only raised a larger semantic issue for me: what are we calling “homework?”
If it’s just schoolwork done at home, then what makes it more valuable than schoolwork done at school? The issue is more complex than that pat answer and deals with what I perceive to be a common failing even of effective educators.
I should state for the record my assumption that students need a certain amount of practice for each new concept.
That certain amount certainly varies by the student, however. Some students don’t need more than a couple problems. Others may need thirty takes to get the concept right.
My point is this: if my kids evaluate and graph forty points over a class period, as they did yesterday, why would I send them home with any more?
The issue for most math teachers, I believe, is one of time management. If your class is slow to start the period and quick to finish, if your transitions are labored, or if you waste time disciplining your class, then you won’t have the time to get through forty problems. The only year I assigned homework with any regularity was during my student-teaching, when my class management plainly sucked, failing by every one of those metrics and more.
By assigning whatever practice we didn’t finish to homework (“… I’d like you guys to finish this for homework …”) or by using homework to compensate for underplanning (“… tell you what, I’ll let you guys start your homework early …”) I was transferring the cost of my poor teaching onto my students.
One more time: my time management was a bust so I helped myself to whatever time I wanted from my students’ personal store, whenever I wanted.
I’ve since taken a cane to my class management. I continuously examine and re-examine how I spend my instructional minutes. Between effective class management and my new hardware package, I am now confident that, in a two-hour block, my students are coming within a gnat’s eyelash of two hour’s worth of instruction and practice.
I know there is value in outside work. It falls to the teacher, though, to take that value seriously, to maximize it in creative ways, and to minimize its cost to the student. Are we there? Or are we somewhere else?
Jonathan takes exception in the comments and, to his credit, he’s got a wily homework scheme that does right by many of my caveats above:
I assign 3 pieces: practice, regular, and challenge. Everyone does regular, and one of the others. So the stronger kids get a couple of challenge problems, and the weaker kids get a fistful of easier exercises to build up some proficiency. And since it is easier, they are more likely to do it.
I find “likelihood of doing homework” to be a troubling measurement, though. If I can’t secure 100% buy-in (like I can in my classroom) and if I can’t verify that the work on the page matches the name at the top, I can’t assume that, okay, we’ve all hit thirty factoring problems, I can move on to evaluating.
Reminds me of a post by Borderland awhile back about an interview with Alfie Kohn, author of “The Myth of Homework” (2006):
I think you’ve nailed the less-than-honourable reasons for giving homework (poor planning and time management), but let me add one more: to allow parents to goof off (“Dad! Dad! Dad!! Let’s play!” “Aw, I’m, erm, busy. Don’t you have any homework to do?”)
There is 1 other reason for giving homework, and that is as prep for the next class. This is particularly true for subjects where background or prior reading are vital or extremely helpful, e.g. English Lit or Social Studies. Don’t know about Math, tho.
I completely agree. Why “punish” the kids that get it, and use their time wisely in class by making them do more skill & drill worksheets? The kids that need the extra practice are not going to do it. In my class we have about 15 problems a day (I only have 50 min classes). Students get 10 – 15 minutes to complete those problems in class and to get help on those problems during that time. Anything after that is homework. The kids that understand it get it done in those 15 minutes, or choose to take it home to work on it. The kids that don’t use their time wisely have homework. I also stay an hour after school each day as a type of study hall for students that need extra help, and I’m at school at least a half hour early for the same thing. The ones that need help will seek help, and everyone knows it’s available.
I did have one parent say to me at a conference “Could you please just give her homework everyday? I don’t care if you even grade it. She just spends to much time on the phone at home.” Sure, I’d love to make your child hate school by doing work that has no meaning. Phone time doesn’t sound like a problem your family should address at all.
I can not tell you how excited I was reading this post. After much soul searching, I have recently decided to return to school to become a math teacher. In preparation for that, I have been reading everything I can get my hands on concerning education. One book I read entitled “The End of Homework” said pretty much what you did, but when I suggested the “no homework” concept to some teacher friends of mine, they all but laughed me out of the room. The fact that you are successfully removing homework from your classroom gives me renewed hope.
This is a really important post for ALL teachers to read and I thank you for putting this out there. I appreciate your reasoning and the study you made to back up your reasoning, however there is a crucial point missing here… many parents are not able to or just don’t help their children with homework anymore. I am in no way blaming parents or saying they are not doing their job. I am saying this is a part of what Dan is talking about.
My mother was a teacher for thirty years and she did not assign homework for the last part of her career because of the lack of home support. This was a risky move for a third grade teacher in a very successful school district. I don’t know how she achieved this without a riot.
I do not assign homework, but I have it easier than majors teachers. I teach Art and Technology electives in a high school. I run my classes like workshops because we are a project based school, my students and I work on the projects together in class. I have told other teachers that I don’t assign homework and I have tried to have this discussion about not giving homework out and it never goes anywhere. I will now point them to this post to articulate the point better.
Do parents, the administration, your colleagues, or your students hassle you about not giving homework?
I like the time management tip, but if you answer yes to any of the above do you have some insight for other teachers that may be considering doing this for their class?
Not with you on this one. I limit homework (and ask students to report back to me how long they spend on assignments), but a little bit of practice on their own helps identify what kids know and what they don’t. Weaker kids come afterschool for extra help or a head start with homework. And I assign 3 pieces: practice, regular, and challenge. Everyone does regular, and one of the others. So the stronger kids get a couple of challenge problems, and the weaker kids get a fistful of easier exercises to build up some proficiency. And since it is easier, they are more likely to do it.
James Herndon’s conclusion on homework was that the point of giving it is simply to see who can do and who can’t, to separate the winners from the losers.
Tony, I’m glad you’re getting into the classroom with your eyes open and your arms full of books. No sense in being uninformed, is there? I haven’t read much hard copy since my student teaching years but, for whatever its worth, Michael Grinder’s Envoy system is the beginning and end of class management as far as I’m concerned. Especially if you’ll be teaching any low-ses or low-achieving populations.
Marcie, in my interview last fall at my current school, they asked and I (extreeeemely hesitantly) told, summarizing much of this post. They knew I would be teaching their lowest Algebra classes and both the math dept. head and the principal agreed with the philosophy. We all kind of put it out there, though, that higher level of mathematics, with a more committed clientèle can often derive some good from homework.
I taught the same low classes at low-ses schools and didn’t have a great deal of parent contact, period, much less any clamoring for increased homework levels. Now I’m mid-ses and the (larger) crowd at back to school night surprised me when I asked if they minded. “We’re raising high schoolers,” one said. “Of course we don’t mind.”
J.D.‘s experience notwithstanding, I have found parents eager to reclaim free time for their kids and grateful for a reason not to nag. And you bring a good point about their inability to help with homework in some instances.
All that said, any teachers thinking about reducing homework need to justify it. (Which probably goes without saying for most pedagogy.) I made sure the parents knew I didn’t assign homework because we practiced so much in class. If I hadn’t offered justification, I’m sure they would’ve been less supportive and more concerned about their kids’ education.
Jonathan, you’re there. Differentiating homework isn’t anything I’d considered until now and if I was pressed into the service of homework I’d tear pages out of your playbook. Good work.
Even when I have assigned homework, though, it’s value, particularly w/r/t planning lessons, seems low. Since I can’t verify that the work on the page matches the name at the top, I can’t assume that, okay, we’ve all hit thirty factoring problems, I can move on to evaluating. Do I simply lack your confidence or have you found a turnpike past that problem also?
If a child has copied some factoring problems (egads, why 30? Factoring is real work. 10 – 15 is a lot of repetition), anyway, if they’ve copied someone else’s (and I will post soon about how I teach factoring), then they have run through the steps 15 times, and have a better chance to be able to attempt it on their own, or at least to follow what is going on when watching it done. I would rather that they all get tons of practice, but it is sufficient that they all spend a few minutes (30 would be good) gaining familiarity with a topic, and running into a pitfall or two.
Learning mathematics (as I like to say) is more similar to learning to play a musical instrument than to studying history. Fluency comes with repetition. Do all kids reach the same level? No. But practice, even in differing quantities, helps all.
I agree with Jonathan. One hour a day (or two hours every other day) in class seems like hardly enough to master anything. Students must be reading at home for English or history, why would mathematics be different?
When reading a book (in English) or covering textbook pages (in history) there is no shortcutting the process. Short of buying Cliff’s Notes or checking online outlines, you have to put in the time reading in order to learn the material. With history and English you aren’t practicing for mastery; you’re practicing for baseline comprehension.
Math doesn’t suffer the same constraint, a fact I employ (along with liberal spiraling throughout a unit) to do away with homework.
This is a tough one. I give homework because I want students to work on math outside of school. I realize, of course, that many don’t do it or that they try to copy. But think of the logic here: We know people will ignore the speed limits. Do we, in turn, decide to do away with them? No, we post them and kinda enforce them. We know every speeder doesn’t get caught. But somewhere between the letter of the law and what people would do without structure, we come to a kind of social compromise on the general norms for driving.
This may be a totally invalid analogy. I haven’t done any research on it and I don’t have a master’s degree. The questions you raise about how homework is used (or misused) and how we value our time versus their time and how we are huge. But there are kids out there in, you know, the “good schools” who do homework every night in addition to getting a lot of good instruction and practice in class. How do students who aren’t getting homework stack up against that?
Man, it took me a trip to the gym and the shower afterwards to figure out what’s screwy about the analogy.
See, there’s very little that could go wrong by obeying speed laws. Morally, it’s an uncomplicated system.
Homework, I believe, is very different. Homework is a very complicated system, the complications of which haven’t been given due consideration.
There are issues of disposition. Are you assigning homework as punishment? Are you strengthening a negative association with learning?
There are issues of class management. Is homework (in part or in whole) a cheap amelioration for lousy time and class management? When you can’t work enough practice into the class period do you assign the rest for homework?
The point is that speed laws have only a fraction of the complications that homework policies do, making “to enforce or not to enforce?” an easy question. Not to kiss Jonathan’s ass any more than I already have, but I think his current policy stays on the right side of a lot of them. If my colleagues all had that kind of intentional, considered homework policy, this post would’ve stayed in the draft pile.
I get that there are issues and questions about homework you think it’s important to consider. But with this awareness, you also choose not to give any homework. I see those as two different things. Do you do what you do because getting to a workable version of a thoughtful system like Jonathan’s is really hard? Or are there other factors that haven’t come out yet in this discussion? I’m just confused — it seems like you have a very well-considered take on what’s good and what’s not good about homework. What’s the problem then with assigning it in a good way? Would it take away from what you do now to, without changing anything else, give 5-10 practice problems every night that reinforce or recombine what your students did during the day?
One deeper reason for me, underneath wanting students to think about math outside of school, is wanting students to learn that some personal responsibility and some self-direction in their learning is important. Now I know better than to leave huge, critical pieces of insight for them to find (or not find) on their own via homework. But if we teach our kids in high school that they don’t have to do homework as long as the teacher is good, what will happen when they get to college? Do we just say, well, that’s a different game and I hope that you will learn to do homework at some point during your first year of college?
I guess I just don’t buy the reasoning behind “strong math students and hard workers will do it and the struggling students or lazy ones won’t, so therefore don’t assign it”. To return to the speed limit analogy, there actually are a lot of things that could go wrong there too: racial profiling, falsifying radar readings to meet ticket quotas, or unnecessarily restrictive speed limits. We address those problems not by removing all speed limits, but instead by making sure the laws are set and enforced in ways that accord with our ultimate goal of safety. I will also at this point acknowledge the irony of this analogy given my own driving habits.
Even with inoffensive homework policies staring me in the face, I choose not to employ them simply because I find homework ineffectual on the whole. Esp. with my freshman Algebra students, the same kids who ace tests, ace them with or without homework. Those who bring a low work ethic into my class, fail tests with or without homework. (Which isn’t to say I’m not working my ass off trying to get their work ethics up to code.)
I took several months to investigate the effect of homework on achievement and comprehension and found it didn’t do much. (Though it wasn’t statistically significant, scores dropped during the experimental week.) Meanwhile, by tossing it, my classes are happier. They bring the heat during class time knowing that if they get enough practice in they don’t have to take it home. And then, on the occasions that I do need to send a project home, they bring the heat there too.
Thanks for the further explanation. I also think it’s really brave that you’re willing to just put out here what you do and let us talk about it, so thanks for that.
Doesn’t not giving them something to work on at home reinforce that work is only done at school and nowhere else?
I never thought of homework as a punishment. In my classes (not high school) I know I can’t possibly talk about everything I’d like them to see. So giving them those problems as homework I make them think more and about more topics than they would see in class.
I hate to appear dismissive, e, but I can’t stress enough that the not-high-school-ness of your situation matters. My kids didn’t enroll in my class. Moreover, my particular crowd is far from honors. This is a crowd that is just 9% Proficient and Advanced, many of which members have outright hated math in the past. Reforming their work ethic and reversing their negative association with mathematics has to be an extremely deliberate, targeted process. It begins in the classroom and extends gradually — very gradually — into the home.
With homework, students don’t learn anything. They practice what they should have already learned. They need practice, but in my opinion, I’d rather have them practice it with me there.
I get notes from parents all the time that say “I don’t know how to do this so I couldn’t help my child.” That’s from the students that even attempt to ask their parents for help. Friday I asked my students to define what a prism is and one said “Prison, thats where my dad and uncle are.”
Worksheets and problems out of a book are not going to make your students life-long learners. They need more of a buy-in than “This will help you with your grade/college/next grade level/state standardized test….” I’m moving more towards projects that are hopefully relevant in some way because then my students are doing “homework” because they want to, not just because it’s something I’ve assigned. But, we have the state standardized tests coming up next month, so we still get plenty of skill-and-drill.
I can assure you that just because they enroll in my classes does not mean that they want to be there. The high correlation between interest and enrollment happens in higher level classes. Calculus, and below (and even some ways above) are classes that are often required by student’s major and are in their eyes unnecessary.
Ok, why not this? Pick five questions, 1 that only the best can do, 1 that’s so easy everyone could do after the first five minutes of the previous lesson, and the other 3 somewhere in between. Number them or label them or rank them, doesn’t matter how, E, M1, M2, M3, H or whatever. And ask each kid to do the hardest 2 that they can do.
It doesn’t have to be like that, but there’s a point: you can make the homework so short and so easy that it’s embarassing not to do. And leave a little challenging enough to make the A students think.
I am so enjoying this site! I crave conversations like this. Conversations that make us reflect and have darn good reasons for what we do!!
Homework as teaching responsibility or about learning outside the classroom: I have found that the students who didn’t do homework in fifth grade are the same students who don’t do homework in eighth grade. Their fifth, sixth and seventh years of assigned homework did not teach them personal responsibility. I think it takes a parent at home to teach that. And if you assign homework, the kids who are not motivated intrinsically to do it, and who don’t have a parent at home to help them with the motivation, these are the kids who will be the high school seniors who still aren’t doing homework.
I really don’t see any evidence that assigning homework helps develop responsibility, unless the parents are involved and, if they are involved, they are helping their child develop responsibility with other methods anyway. They don’t need our homework assignments to help them do that.
Homework as practice: There is a quote (from who knows?) that says, “Practice does not make perfect. Practice makes PERMANENT.” So if struggling kids are going home and practicing something they don’t fully understand, there is the distinct possibility that they are making their errors even more entrenched. And that, in turn, means that valuable face-time in class has to be used to find their misconceptions, to “unteach” their errors and set them on the right track.
And on the other side, students who fully understand how to do it, don’t really need to practice it anyway.
By fully understand, I don’t mean they can repeat the method without looking it up. That they’ve memorized a formula. I mean CONCEPTUALLY understand. If they conceptually understand (and we spend our class time getting them to this point) why we invert fractions when we divide, then they don’t really need a lot of practice to make it perfect. That conceptual understanding is now a part of them and when they divide fractions, they know exactly what to do.
I rarely assign homework. I want to see what my students are doing. I want to be there when they ask questions. Only when I know what they know and where they are struggling, can I plan meaningful instruction for the next day.
If I do assign homework it’s after the kids have reached a conceptual understanding and I want them to process the idea, evaluate, and make connections and personal meaning. An example: I ask them to talk with their parents about the concept to see how it occurs in “real life”. Then we start the next day with a rich discussion of what they discovered.
At the beginning of the year, I explained all of these thoughts to the parents at Open House. I saw plenty of nods of agreement, and I have received positive feedback throughout the year. So no parents or administrators have questioned my practices.
Mindy: I rarely assign homework. I want to see what my students are doing. I want to be there when they ask questions. Only when I know what they know and where they are struggling, can I plan meaningful instruction for the next day.
This part resonates with me most. Perhaps it’s lingering guilt over this post but for whatever reason I’ve assigned homework both days this week and, both times, I’ve felt as if I blindly tossed 30 different bowling balls down 30 different lanes.
And I still don’t buy it. If kids have the answers in the back of the book, they will know that they don’t have it, and ask the next day. There’s no entrenching errors there.
Dan has one of my “homework calendars.” If it is typical (I think it was), then most of the exercises are odd numbers, with answers in the back.
The next day some kids put up homework exercises when they come in the room. They choose whether or not to do so, but they get “credit” for doing so. They can put up impressive work for us to admire, or a problem they were unsure of for constructive comments, or a problem that stumped them for complete review, and they get “credit” for any one of these.
Again, I think about learning an instrument. Kids practice between lessons. I think practicing math is analagous.
Dan, what you describe is that ol’ education catch-22 about services and attention not getting to the folks who need it the most. It’s not a fun place to hang out.
That said, I teach the lowest 7th graders in East San Jose, literally. That puts them in the running for some of the lowest in the state, and I homework the hell out of em, and they get it done. How? It’s always easy, short, predictable, and explicitely tied to what we do in class.
I give numerous small assignments. Five minutes vocab, five minutes spelling, 10 minutes grammar, 10 minutes writing response, and the big one, 30 minutes reading. Of these, the only thing we struggle with is the reading, and that improves as accountability (an extra period to accomplish the reading) is added.
I think homework, and the work ethic it develops, is too important to disregard, and too especially important to the kids who need it.
That said, if you bring your students to proficient without it, that’s impressive as hell. As always, results over process.
My Original Post: The kids who need it most (D and F students), won’t, or else they’ll do it halfassedly, gaining as much credit with the least effort possible.
The “it,” here does refer to “homework” so Darren‘s query is fair. But what I’m getting at throughout the post is that “it” really signifies “the conceptual practice our students would ideally derive from homework.”
These kids — 91% of them Basic and lower — need practice and far from writing them off as no-accounts I’m simply saying, why can’t we get exactly that amount of practice during our class hours. Occasionally, we don’t get enough breadth or depth so I send some problems home. Typically, though, I ask my students for a huge investment in class, they oblige, and in return their free time is theirs.
There’s a lot of meaty stuff in this discussion, and I’m only chewing on a small, somewhat-left-of-point, chunk of it here.
One thing this highlights for me is the need for much more varied, nuanced approaches to these big questions. It’s part of the problem of the “education” discourse as a whole (and most discourse of any importance, actually): namely, too much generalization.
When I hear things like “studies show homework is good / bad,” I think … in which grades? What kind of homework? How much of it? Always? etc.
Common sense tells us bad homework (i.e. busywork) is always bad. Most studies tell us homework in elementary grades does more harm than good. Most studies tell us homework in the middle grades can be effective if it’s intelligently designed and kept minimal. Most studies tell us that homework at the high school level is generally helpful (again, providing the assignments are worthwhile to begin with).
But those are grades, not levels of intellectual / social / emotional development, and not disciplines, and not specific goals within each discipline. These need to be considered, as well.
I guess I’m just calling out, perhaps unnecessarily, the need to think and talk in ways that show we are aware of the particularly and context that informs our discourse and our practice.
Case in point: TMAO says “results over process.” This may be true in math. It’s nearly anti-thetical to a composition class.
Reading, reflection, and writing of any value is going to require “work outside of school” (or a significantly smaller scope to the curriculum) because of the simple limitation of time and because of the importance of process in those tasks.
For me, that’s the crux of Dan’s post. We are using their time–in class and out–whether they can appreciate that fact or not. We should use it well.
Not to digress Eric’s good comment further, but I feel like we intensify the divide between Authority Figure and Those Under Authority — a divide that I find unfriendly to learning — when we treat our students’ time cavalierly. Their TV-watching / sleeping / friend-chatting / MySpacing / exercising time deserves respect, which isn’t to say, “Don’t assign homework.” Just that if you are going to encroach, have the decency to encroach thoughtfully. TMAO and Jonathan have both put forward strategies that are way more modest than my own, the sort of thoughtfulness our students deserve.
I didn’t read every word in these comments, but in my scan of them I didn’t see any mention of the value of having students learn to learn something on their own. I realize I am working with community college students–so therefore older than elementary school kids–but I believe in helping students become more independent learners. Nothing I know of does that better than homework, as long as it is coupled with in-class learning and work and out-of-class support.
I find it very interesting and incredibly encouraging to see so many educators on this blog, spending their “downtime” pondering how to to better their curriculum and classtime.
I was one of those “ones that needed it most” throughout my highschool math experience. Although I was always brighter than average in other subjects, I could never grasp the math. No matter how much homework was assigned, it really made no difference to me. No matter how clear the teacher was, I would not be able to solve the equations on my own beyond what I could memorize. My parents were supportive, yet, there came a time when they were at a loss in helping me succeed.
One teacher used the method that we’re discussing here; he required very little homework and demanded our greatest efforts in classtime. It was extremely effective with our class and myself included.
If nothing else, understand that the sheer fact that you are spending time online, communing with other teachers, and engaging in these rebellious, revolutionary math-teacher discussions means that you CARE. You CARE about your work, and if your students are gaining something from their experience with you. And that puts you far, far, far above the others.
I was an A math student in high school. Although I’m in the category Dan says will do the homework but don’t need to do it, I disagree. I needed to do it. Drill brings procedural fluency which leads to better understanding. For problems beyond drill, the more problems I did, the better I got at it.
I’m not saying that Dan’s techniques are bad, it’s just that not everyone fits in the boxes he has so carefully defined.
Certainly, I’ve generalized with my categorization. Even though my experience and studies have propped those boxes up, I’m always watching out for students like you were who need differentiated practice and instruction. (See also: the A student who needs one comprehensive problem rather than a fifteen question set.)
I was an A student in algebra in college. I could not have maintained that level of proficiency without massive homework. This was the only way to become surefooted. It was only through massive homework that things like factoring polynomials finally clicked. Without massive homework all those point-slopes, slope-intecepts and what have you would have been a jumble.
I’m a parent who’s really happy to see so many teachers so thoughtfully pondering what’s best for their students. In my public school district, teachers don’t have a lot of individual choice about homework. Even our kindergarteners (who all go to school for a full day) get homework M-Th, in spite of the research that shows it’s either useless or harmful. I despise it — I think my 6-year-old has given school enough of his time during the day. He’s gone 7.5 hours/day, including the bus ride. I think that’s more than enough school time.
In general, even for older kids, I’m a homework minimalist: it had better be infrequent and meaningful when it’s assigned. I would not be happy with an hour of homework for one 7th grade class. What if all teachers gave their 7th graders an hour of homework each night? That’s ridiculous, especially if they’re spending only 50 minutes in each class! If the homework time exceeds class time, we have a problem. (Not to mention that kids work at different paces — for some kids “one hour” of homework can take longer.)
Kids need more time to come home and do the things that are important to them. I honestly don’t think you teach responsibility by compelling kids to do things and then punishing them if they don’t. Carrots and sticks don’t teach responsibility. Kids learn to be responsible when they make real choices and commitments and then honor them.
Having said all that, I think the real issue here isn’t whether homework is good or bad. It is the one-size-fits-all nature of most public (and many private) schools. An entire class of students is covering the same material at the same time and pace, regardless of their ability to do so. The kids who can move faster wait for others to catch up. The kids who need more time — those who supposedly need the homework the most, but who really need more time with the teacher — have to try to keep up and often move to new topics without mastering the current one. The one-size-fits all model is the real problem, not homework itself.
Uf. Definitely felt the one-size-fits-all-edness of public ed, today. I can usually do the differentiation game serviceably well, but the Justins finished the entire practice regiment while other kids were struggling to find some traction. I’m realizing this one class carries FBB all the way to Advanced, which, though partly a scheduling whoopsie, is a symptom of the current system. But what’s the alternative for educating our heterogeneous population en masse? Apprenticeship? Trade school? Nah.
why even have math teachers? why not just have books? the good students will learn from them, the bad students won’t anyway. with good time management, they can practice in 2 hours.
Carrots and sticks DO teach behavior. A 14 yr old is not a perfectly formed adult. They need their behavior modeled, constrained, shaped, and reinforced. To think otherwise is to be unfair to the adolescent.
Assigning homework, rewarding positively those who do it, and negatively those who don’t, reinforces positive behavior.
Practicing what you learned in school also reinforces positive behavior, too. Because the ability to write a proof, or use the angle of cosines is a behavior as well as sitting still is.
Behaviors aren’t learned by deducing them. They are learned by practicing them. Knowing the appropriate time to use the law of cosines vs. deMoivre’s theorem is a learned behavior. you are depriving your students of the opportunity to learn those behaviors to mastery.
You don’t solve the mastery problem by throwing out homework. You solve it by homework AND more teacher time.
Worse, though, is that you’ve abdicated teaching to mastery. You have no way of knowing which of your students could learn–you’ve assumed you already know. You have no way of salvaging an incorrect assumption by thorough student evaluation, either. You expect them to do that themselves. If they could, they wouldn’t need you at all.
You seem to believe in the universal good of homework, that any outside practice is good practice, the good of which is impossible to replicate in class, and none of those is a priori true.
I admit the broadness and coldness of those archetypes up there, but in the case of students who lag by multiple grade levels, I have found them accurate with a margin of error of maybe 4% of a class. I’m not saying, “you, you, and you will never be able to do homework, so we’re done trying.” I’m saying, “you come into this class with a very specific set of needs and wants, each of which I will accommodate and, when necessary, help you exterminate.”
In the specific, it would be profoundly irresponsible of me to ignore their negative association of homework with math, particularly when I don’t find a lot of value in homework I can’t replicate in class. I’m not going to waive attendance simply because they’d rather be elsewhere. I can’t replicate the value of attendance elsewhere. Not so with homework.
The short, probably unsatisfying, answer to the question “If not homework then why math teachers, even,” is that I’m worth a lot more to my students’ learning outcomes than homework is. I mean, the idea you put forward that without homework students can’t build positive behaviors, a strong work ethic, or attain mastery — that without homework I can’t evaluate them — is preposterous.
My students practice. And when I italicize that, I’m talking lengthy problem sets often built from scratch that scaffold at a surgically precise rate, that allow advanced students to cruise through the easy and struggle with the hard, that allow me plenty of time to help those who need the help. We work from bell-start to bell-end, a merit badge that hasn’t come easily, and since you’re keen on behavior, it’s worth mentioning that I come down hard on laziness and publicly prop up the students who power through moments which they’ve predefined as I Can Do No More.
For whatever else it’s worth, if I thought for a second I was “depriving [my] students of the opportunity to learn those behaviors to mastery,” I’d bail instantly and assign some problem sets pronto. But I haven’t and your comment, which equates homework with (variously) mastery, behavior, assessment, and teaching itself, is unconvincing. I mean, is there anything homework can’t do?
My high school calculus teacher spent large portions of our math period going over LAST night’s assigned homework, for those of us (and I include myself) who struggled with it.
More direct instruction up front, and less reteaching later, would have helped immensely. I often got home to do homework in high school about a concept we’d only vaguely covered in class. As an A+ student it was assumed I could “figure it out”. If that were the case, I wouldn’t need a teacher.
Homework does have its purposes, but it isn’t going to teach kids something that they failed to learn through direct instruction, only reinforce what they already got from it. I think it’s very useful for kids with processing speed problems and memory issues (such as the group I now work with) who can’t get through enough practice problems during the class period because their learning disabilities slow them down. Then they get home, and it’s a struggle to remember what they did in class. If homework is not assigned, they return to class the next day barely remembering what we even covered, and very likely have lost much of the hard work that they put in the previous day.
The behavior they teach is compliance. They don’t teach responsibility, which is by no means irrelevant. Carrots and sticks manipulate student behavior — take the carrots and sticks away, and what do you have? Where’s the internal motivation to learn or to take responsibility for one’s own education?
What’s wrong with practicing in school, anyway? You can practice in school and determine mastery by giving a test.
Montessori schools do a good job of educating mixed age and ability classes of students. Each child learns at his or her own pace by using self-correcting materials. Montessori schools truly offer individualized education, particularly in reading, writing, and math.
—The short, probably unsatisfying, answer to the question “If not homework then why math teachers, even,” is that I’m worth a lot more to my students’ learning outcomes than homework is.
really? prove that. I mean, where’s your evidence? because you say you, with your in class two hours of practice are *it* to achieve mastery. put up some darn evidence that I can’t replace you with a well written schaum’s outline. and for the below-grade-level students? I see *zero* evidence that you are worth more.
I actually believe in direct instruction, but I see what you’re describing as undermining it, since you are already writing off large portions of your classes. Better upfront direct instruction coupled with well wriiten homework is a heck of a lot better than busy work. that you jump to busy work as a defn of homework is merely a straw man.
–I mean, the idea you put forward that without homework students can’t build positive behaviors, a strong work ethic, or attain mastery — that without homework I can’t evaluate them — is preposterous.
no, it isn’t perposterous. but let’s put it to the test, shall we? let’s see which students succeed. the KIPPers with homework or your kids without? i’m willing to admit I’m wrong if you show results. so how can we evaluate them? hm?
–My students practice. And when I italicize that, I’m talking lengthy problem sets often built from scratch that scaffold at a surgically precise rate, that allow advanced students to cruise through the easy and struggle with the hard, that allow me plenty of time to help those who need the help.
uh huh. that’s sure working for the kids you wrote off. not to mention that you could design such problem sets and assign them for homework TOO, and build the actual mastery of the A students, instead of stopping when your two hours is up.
Quick response to e who mentioned that students must be doing HW in English and History. My kids do now and then have HW in both English and history, but it’s project based and not particularly frequent. In math on the other hand, they both have 20-30 problems every single night. So I see thought going into the English and History homework assigned. In math I see tradition.
Greifer, if you are able to write problem sets scaffolded so well that 9th graders in low-income areas can progress through them without having anyone holding their hand, could you please publish some samples? I have been assigning a lot of homework, but have had to recognize that the homework I collect contains so much error and misunderstanding that I must revise the ratio of homework to in-class work heavily in favor of the former, and I can well imagine that doing away with homework altogether would be just as well. However, if you can write Algebra and Geometry assignments that work for students who struggle with place value, multiplication, placing decimal numbers on a number line, and plotting points – in such a way that the assignments are useful to all students – please do make them available; they would be much appreciated. I have put some work into writing assignment sets that allow students to check for consistency themselves, but the level of understanding and commitment required by students in order to use these features is often just not there.
Lori‘s comment is important, that homework in math is often assigned by tradition. It is also important to acknowledge that math homework is often given to ameliorate the effects of crappy time/class management.
Conversely, it’s important for me to acknowledge the work of teachers like Jonathan and TMAO (see further back in the comments), who are giving targeted, differentiated, and well-scaffolded assignments to their students.
Teachers have a universal mandate to think about why we do what we do. That goes for every element of our jobs. The only reason this post is riding the top of the Most Read tally is that homework rarely gets this meta-cognitive treatment. We should do better.
My meta-cognitive question has been this: what is it about homework that I can’t replicate in class?
So I’ve appreciated all the comments that have exemplified effective uses of homework, reasons homework oughtta stick around. I’m thinking about assigning one, maybe two problems a night, and revisiting my Masters thesis. In that regard, this has been a very useful conversation for me. Thanks.
GREIFER: put up some darn evidence that I can’t replace you with a well written schaum’s outline. and for the below-grade-level students? I see *zero* evidence that you are worth more.
Almost forgot about Greifer. Look, brah, we’re beyond yin-yang on this point. I’m urging moderation and meta-cognition on the homework issue and you’re some kind of cartoon.
I’m happy to post my CST results when we get them. I know I’m scoring gains without homework. It’s possible I could do even better with homework. I have my doubts. Regardless, I don’t think it’ll matter one whit to someone who thinks any teacher is replaceable by a robot with a lesson outline much less a teacher who puts in the hours that I do.
GREIFER: well wriiten [sic] homework is a heck of a lot better than busy work. that you jump to busy work as a defn of homework is merely a straw man.
I never defined homework as busy work. Never used the words. So I’m not sure whose comment you’re responding to.
Dan , you have a great conversation going here and it’s good to see multiple perspectives. Let me add my two cents.
Jonathan’s point on repetition makes sense on the surface but misses an important component of drill, and that is feedback. At home, there may be no appropriate feedback, so a student could do a drill incorrectly 15 times, thereby reinforcing the wrong skills. Hal says that students should “learn to learn for themselves”. I agree, but that motivation must be intrinsic not directed from outside. As John Taylor Gatto (author of the 7 Lesson Schoolteacher) said; “to do your homework is a fake responsibility”.
Another issue is that math homework competes with homework from all the other subjects, so students get a potpourri of unrelated assignments. Dan Pinker wrote in Slate Magazine, “Cognitive psychology has shown that the mind best understands facts when they are woven into a conceptual fabric, such as a narrative, mental map, or intuitive theory. Disconnected facts in the mind are like unlinked pages on the Web: They might as well not exist. Science has to be taught in a way that knowledge is organized, one hopes permanently, in the minds of students.” Your learning flow in the classroom probably accomplishes more than any homework assignment could possibly do.
You ask, “But what’s the alternative for educating our heterogeneous population en masse? Apprenticeship? Trade school? Nah”. One of the more interesting proposals is from Alvin Toffler. Here are some things he proposes for the school of the future:
What I find interesting in our school system (I only speak from knowledge of our local department of education) is how little the curriculum developers, administrators and teachers know about cognitive science. Too often, discussing education is like discussing religion – too many beliefs and not enough facts.
Thanks for your thoughts on the issues brought up, which have kinda multiplied over the comments. To anyone interested (like I was) in Dan Pink’s Slate article, which Harold references, it’s here. Love it when name-brand authors slum it on Slate.
I generally only assign exercises with answers in the book, so there is instant feedback. For questions where they cannot match the book answer, I have a relatively compulsive homework review routine (see this post) that gives (only slightly) delayed feedback.
There was one good thing about homework when I was in elementary school and high school. It gave me an idea of what the teacher wanted me to learn, but it was studying the matierial that was covered that was helpful. However, if I had too much homework one night, then I would neglect studying that subject later on. I would feel stressed that I had spent so much time on one thing so I woud move on to something else that I was not as sick of seeing. Having huge amounts of homework irritated me more than helped. If I was irritated enough, I would avoid it for as long as possible and then try to do it last minute if only so I could get partial credit. I am not saying that all homework is bad, but I think that if it is important enough to a student to do well, then they are probably going to study, ask questions, pay attention in class, etc. without a huge bunch of homework. Also, as DAN said, students who did not really care would not benefit from the homework anyway because they would not do it. If anything, teachers taking the assignments up for a grade hurt them.
When I was a boy they were called students from poor families (as opposed to poor students). I’m wondering if you are avoiding casting a similar aspiration on families, i.e., avoiding calling them dysfunctional?
1. Students _can_ learn from homework. I remember many times working through math assigned math problems unable to quite get it, often because I couldn’t remember what was explained or what I did in class. My solution? To figure it out on my own, usually be re-reading the instructional materials in the book, reviewing my (often poorly transcribed) notes, or–as a last resort–asking someone else for help. Sure, if my teacher had been the stellar, surgically precise, and uncompromising instructor that you describe yourself as I probably would have remembered every iota of information and instruction… Anyway, at the very least I learned how to learn on my own, and the self-directed discovery was quite valuable. If I had been in the classroom I probably would have just feigned along with the rest of the class, or else asked for help, simply because its so much easier that way. At home I had no choice but to figure it out (mmm, the stick). In my own teaching I’ve found that students who are forced to figure out some things on their own are better for the experience, as the impact of such discoveries are often stronger than the spoon-fed or even collectively/collaboratively constructed alternatives.
2. I think there’s pedagogical value it the repetitive pattern of schoolwork + homework _partitioned by time/distance_. My previous anecdote implies the value of distance, but time also can be useful in activating and reactivating memory. The farther your get from the original instance, the harder it will be to recall and apply, and so practice recalling and applying at multiple temporal distances seems appropriate for learning.
3. Someone complained about carrot-stick as being inducive of mere compliance. There’s a difference between compliance, discipline, and self-discipline. Compliance may produce discipline, but self-discipline? Can that ever be developed without loving womb of external disciplinary forces (mmm, the stick)? The positive value of self-discipline takes me back to other positive character traits that can be developed through homework, namely self-reliance and independence–both of which I find to be sorely neglected in public (and even private) schools.
I think those partially answers dan’s question, “What is it about homework that I can’t replicate in class?” I daresay the most significant answer to that question is “more time”.
BTW, I love the concept of omitting every instructional practice that does not show resulted, however my caveat would be, if you’ve absolutely proven that its consistently ineffective when conducted using reliable methods. At present I’m not convinced that homework is ineffective; so far any such evaluations of homework appear to be primarily anecdotal, not to mention limited in breadth.
It’s #2 that’s kind of shifted my perspective this year. Particularly on a block schedule where my kids put math out of sight and out of mind for two days, I’ve found retention is to be shamefully low. Even for the populations I’m teaching. Having them hit a classwork problem several hours after class would have an effect, as you cite, that I could not reproduce in class.
So next year: one homework problem. Maybe two, tiering them a lé Jonathan’s method above. But something. And only because I don’t see my kids every day. Otherwise, I remain unconvinced of homework’s efficacy in low-level math classrooms.
What do other studies on homework show? Well, reading assignments of 20 minutes seems to be the only type of homework shown to benefit learners.
Researchers have found that reading 20 minutes every night improves fluency, writing, concepts and vocabulary acquisition, and OVERALL school performance.
I never assigned a lot of homework, and what I did focused on an application of the math or science I taught in the home or elsewhere outside of school (e.g. perform a pH test on your pets’ saliva, then create a class graph of the results, discuss possible patterns, etc.).
I see some clear benefits, however. First and foremost is the opportunity to engage parents in their children’s learning. I realize not everyone receives equal assistance or attention from their folks, but life is not equal, is it? As for the concept that something is only worth doing if 100% get the benefit, that’s like saying you have a vaccine that will prevent cancer, but only in 10% of those receiving it, so why bother? 100% is great and something to shoot for as often as possible, but to pass up on the chance to impact even 1 out of 25 kids is a mistake. The opportunity to have a kid actually work WITH their mom or dad to solve a problem is priceless.
The problem, as I have witnessed it, is that many teachers’ concept of homework is to simply assign busy work or repetitive practice which they could do in class, and which the students would be better served doing with the teacher’s guidance. This is missing on a great opportunity to apply what is learned in a place schools don’t spend much time–the real world.
BTW, Greg Farr pointed me to your site as a great example for the possibilities of a teacher’s blog, and I’m grateful to him. Your site is tremendous–keep it coming!
We teach students, not parents. Homework is assigned to the student only, not parents. That’s never the intent of homework, is it? A parent working with a child on homework is a completely unintended side effect that should never be taken into consideration when deciding on homework assignments.
NEVER considered? If you work in a eutopia where parental involvement in their kids’ is a given, maybe not. Not all parents have the slightest clue how to be involved in their children’s education, and homework can be a very effective tool to help them do so.
*sigh* 69 comments in, I’ve got to mention I’m kind of embarrassed that this is my flagship post. It’s got this bluntly provocative title, the sort of thing that’d show up on digg if diggers had any interest in education.
Anyway, things I’ve learned since, and which Rebecca partially spoke to, is the benefit of a short assignment, completed some time after the instruction. Jonathan’s got his tiered system and TMAO has small, explicit tasks, and I dig that.
Basically, I worry that teachers (especially math teachers) don’t consider why they’re assigning problems one through thirty odd or what instructional outcome it brings about and whether that outcome is worth the cost to the class’ disposition.
Randy, I agree with Todd that homework oughtta be assigned for the student, though I should fully disclose that I don’t have kids. I dig the parent involvement angle but, more often than not, in math, I have parents telling me they’re grateful I don’t assign much homework because they have no idea how to help. Even if a parent were college educated and could help, it’s unclear to me how a teacher would a train (for lack of a better word) a parent to take part in the kid’s homework.
The inconsistency in the cancer vaccine metaphor: even if the vaccine only affects 1 person out of 25, it doesn’t hurt the other 24. If only 1 student out of 25 finds the assigned homework valuable the other 24 are, in some form or another, experiencing a negative outcome, one which I can’t ignore.
But, this shouldn’t make the topic “Homework or Not” and the questions that come from a discussion less salient.
It is certainly of concern to parents (who are tired of the stress and conflict caused by homework), students (who feel overwhelmed and underengaged by homework), and teachers (who hate assigning homework and grading it).
I give homework, but it is more like school work or extra work. You’re right, those kids who will do it don’t necessarily need it. The kids who may need ‘it’ actually don’t need homework, they need extra practice, guidance, and explanation – which they get from me during homework club.
Love homework club – it’s basically become an extra period for me to work with those kids who need an extra period to complete the work.
Sometimes I give true homework – but it’s usually in the form of a scavenger hunt or something when I want them to bring some material into the class for a lesson.
I have had teachers get angry with me for not giving homework, that the kids are getting away with something. hmph. Generally my kids work their butts off in class – they aren’t getting away with anything but learning, sorry.
It is such a simple concept. How can I help kids do their assignments if I can’t monitor what they are doing and help guide them through the processes and procedures? I think there is too much emphasis on “getting the right answer…by yourself…use only a pencil…keep your eyes on your own paper…”
I remember taking “geo-trig” in high school (many years ago..) I remember copying tonnes of homework off of the class “brain” so I could at least get marks for the “homework check”. I barely passed the class…but didn’t learn a darn thing. As a teacher, I have always taken that experience with me into every course I have taught.
I totally agree with your philosophy on homework. I remember being a student and hating homework that was given to me. I often copied it, rushed through with a minimal amount of effort, or sometimes did not do it. I can recall several lessons given by teachers in class that stuck with me to this day but cannot remember a single homework assignment. Real learning comes from a great teacher in a class, not from homework. A teacher can successfully teach a classroom of students with minimal homework, or possibly none at all, if the class operates with ruthless efficiency and the content is engaging.
Now that I am a teacher, my anti-homework philosophy has grown even stronger. I see students copying work or finishing assignments from other classes in my room multiple times a week. Sure, students should do their homework at home but it does not always work that way. Many students have responsibilities or living conditions that make it very difficult to work at home. In addition, some people have posted that students who do not complete homework will be “punished” with a bad grade, but it is these same students who do not do their homework that are unmotivated by poor grades.
The best way to motivate these students is to create a classroom environment that is safe, fun, and highly structured to maximize learning opportunities. I am happy to see other teachers questioning the true nature of homework and looking for the most efficient way to teach students.
Wow! Great post. I’ve got to admit to skipping the comments. Maybe I’ll read them some other time. I expect there is both agreement and disagreement. But I agree!!!
I’m not a k-12 teacher. I educate adults, but I am a parent of three elementary children. I hate homework. Teachers, I have better things to do with my children when I get home from work, than do your job for you. Yes I said better things to do. Things like playing in the yard. Things like teaching them to play guitar, since most music programs get secondary attention at best. Things like going for a walk, since P.E. programs also get second rate attention.
Did I mention that I hate homework. Teachers are constantly complaining that if parents did their job at home, then the teachers job would be easier. I agree that much parenting is ineffective, probably even some of mine. But… I could be a better parent if I had more time with my kids. Like the time they currently spend doing homework.
My final point: My first and second graders do NOT need a 10 hour work day. They need time to run and play, and learn things by doing them. Oops, that’s another pet peeve slipping in.
I don’t think this idea has been mentioned in the comments, so I’ll share, even though I’m late jumping in.
From years as a tutor, I knew that most of the kids who needed the practice only did homework to “get through it” not generally to practice or understand concepts.
I can’t emphasize enough, as someone who worked with these kids outside of the classroom: the HARDEST thing to do is to tell a student that they need to do more questions when they have “finished” what the teacher assigned. In their mind, they are DONE, even if they couldn’t get through a single one of those questions on their own. This has always been my biggest beef with assigning specific homework questions — it’s seen as the goal itself, not the means to the goal.
So, when I taught, I didn’t want any student to have an arbitrary checklist. I knew from private tutoring that each student would be “done” (as in, well-versed enough to go on) in a different amount of time, with a different number of practice questions. I needed them to understand when and why they were done.
Instead of assigning homework, at the beginning of each class there would be a quiz. Just a short quiz of 2 – 5 BASIC questions covering the bare minimum I’d expect them to have gotten out of the last lesson. Their “homework” was to prepare for the quiz.
For some kids, that would mean a couple of practice questions. For others, it would mean asking me for MORE questions from different sources because they’d done everything in the book but still needed assistance to get through them. I purposely only chose basic questions for the quiz because each kid learns at a different pace, too. And, sometimes it’s only after a few interconnected lessons that things really “click.” But, if they can at least keep up with the basic concepts on a daily level, then there’s time (and hope) for building up to the advanced questions they should expect on a test.
-we had huge blocks of time for each class, so I could still teach a new lesson, let them work on problems even though the beginning of each period was taken up with assessment
-our schedule was such that students had the same classes every OTHER day, so there was always adequate time to get extra help between classes, or spend 2 nights practicing. I didn’t have to expect “instant comprehension.”
What started to happen was kids would show up early EVERY class, often as much as an hour early, and they would all work on practice problems together (and I’d usually be there, and willing to help). Our schedule meant that math was either first thing in the morning, or right after lunch, so often kids just ate their lunch in the math room working on problems. I found that most students did MORE work than they would have had they just been assigned homework questions, and also that their focus was very different: they strove to be able to do the questions, not just get through them.
The other advantage is they had feedback every single class as to whether they had put enough time/effort in to understanding the last class’ material. Teacher and student both had a very clear picture of how ready each individual was to move on because of the constant assessment. And, with so many quizzes, each one was worth such a small portion of their grade that they could have a bad day and it wouldn’t significantly affect their over all mark.
I don’t buy the “homework is practice in responsibility” argument because it mischaracterizes the goal. The goal is to be able to do, not to check off which questions you have done. Kids need more help/practice/training with being self-assessors, and that’s what I was trying to do with my students. That’s what they would face in the next year or two at university, where self-knowledge is key to academic survival.
So, hats off to no homework, but for helping students to become academically independent so that they can make good, sound decisions for themselves about how to use their time outside of class!
I grew up with math homework, so like some posters, I’d expect to see teachers today assigning homework out of practice. For one, I did learn something from my math homework. But I’d go to my mom for help, and that time we spent together was indeed learning time. I had self-motivation. I was in advanced algebra and all the upper-level courses. I was college-bound.
I think since I graduated from high school (1992), the times have changed with attitudes. I agree with your premise… that kids that need extra practice won’t do the work; those that need it less, are the ones that might be motivated to go for the effort.
I’m glad you’ve found a solution that is working for you. I agree with others that the problem is not necessarily the pedagogical approach of homework, but a societal problem with learning, expectations, etc.
I’m not math teacher, but am a K-12 educator. My guess is… I’d be assigning homework, but not “problem sets.” I’d be asking kids on occasion to bring-in artifacts that could be used in real-world problem solving. Math homework of a different sort. Despite the popularity of your post, it was refreshing and insightful to read.
I teach high school math to seniors in a suburban Cincinnati school. The class is for students who plan on furthering their education after high school but are not great math students. I assign homework and post the solutions online for the students to use to check their work. I believe a great deal of learning goes on when students are given the opportunity to find their own mistakes and correct them or help others correct their mistakes. We all learn best by teaching others and so I have my students try to help each other as much as possible. They can look at their homework while taking the weekly quiz so the better they do on their homework and the more they show their work the better they do on the quiz which is worth more points. At the end of a unit I give them 2 assessments. One is a traditional test which, if they do poorly, they can retake after correcting their first test. The other is a project based assesment where they must demonstrate their knowledge of the concepts taught through some sort of performance task. There are still some students who don’t do their homework but the ones who truly buy into the system do very well in my class as well as in college after they graduate. I have had many students come back after a few years and tell me they never would have made it through college algebra without my class and that makes it all worthwhile.
I am just a parent who sees the light of curiosity dimming in her formerly enthusiastic 5th grader’s eyes because of unrealistic homework demands. It sickens me that educators can’t do their jobs in the 6 or 7 hours they have with our children every day. I’m sorry you folks have to teach to these ridiculous standardized tests. Is that what it’s all about after all?
I am a 5th grader with the every day homework of 2 hours and when I’m sick it has taken me 3 extra days to finsh missing work. I do not understand why the give us so much homework to have it done in so little tim!!!!!!!! we are punished if we don’t do our homework. the problem I have is Y have so much homework I lose trak of all my other homework! so I hope they will litten up on homework soon!
I always have trouble finishing inthe short time we are given to finish in class so I hope someday homework will be gone!
@Ann: most of the people who write on this website are teachers, and even though I am not one, I am a parent of four children. Let me offer you this advice:
Many times in your life, someone will require you to do something you have a hard time doing. Unfortunately, most of the time, you will still have to finish the task even if you don’t understand why or don’t agree that you should have to do it. You are not alone in finding this frustrating and difficult.
Still, you should do your best to complete the task anyway. There is a great lesson in finishing assignments not just when you want to but also when you are required to.
While you are doing the work, remember two things: 1) someday you will be older, and you will be the one making decisions about what other people should do, and 2) you will find lots of people in the world who are like the teachers on this website, people who are trying to do things differently because they think they can do those things better! The day you find those people will be the day you know all the hard work you are doing now was worth it.
I really enjoyed your post. I agree with it wholeheartedly. It was also very interesting about a teacher being well organized and one who manages the classroom effectively.
Apparently, there’s no need to assign homework if other teachers can use your blog as their homework assignment.
Dan, I really appreciate this blog. I am a high school English teacher who teaches a wide range of students in both grades (9th, 11th, 12th) and abilities (very low 9th to AP 11th). I really appreciate your thoughts on homework; I’ve seen some of the same conclusions in English studies regarding grammar. I also think it cuts down on cheating (I’d rather not mention all my parent-written or Internet-copied writing assignments).
I do think, however, that your ideas are easier to implement in math than other disciplines. For me, I greatly believe in the value of having kids read long books, not just short stories found in textbooks, so I often assign 20-30 minutes of READING (not grammar exercises or pointless writings) 4-5 nights a week.
Suppose that the amount of work that a student need to do to understand a math concept is a constant. Reducing the amount of homework means more work at school. Could you please tell me how to boost efficiency at class?
It is not necessary for practice to happen at home. In fact, not only could it happen at school, I think it should. But, we’d have to have a different structure to the school day. Practice (and while we’re at it… grading and evaluating) could become part of the daily in-school routine, freeing up everyone to go home to their other activities. If we had the time built into the day for that practice. Five uninterrupted 90 minute classes a week and I’d never give homework. But, that is not my world. So, I give homework.
Your argument for not giving homework is not persuasive to me, however. You suggest a couple of things that I have questions about. One… that those who do the work don’t need it. That seems to be about the work itself, not about whether to give assignments. My first thought is that maybe your practice needs to be more differentiated, so that your top workers can get benefit for their labors, as opposed to just routinely drilling one size fits all work designed for less able students.
But, the reason that really doesn’t reach me is the idea that you don’t give homework because the students who need it won’t do it. That is probably the worst reason I can think of not to give homework. I am not a big fan of avoidance. It is convenient and temporarily happy-making, but it denies students the daily opportunity to choose and choose yet again. By removing the reasonable requirement of practice, you create a certain level of ease. You relieveyourself of the frustration of observing your students making poor choices and you relieve them of direct contact with those choices. You choose for them. What have they learned other than that the world moves with their whine and that nothing much matters until they hit the hard, cold floor that no one told them was there?
If I were to use the no homework approach the reason would be that my theory is that it would improve learning for many students and not do any harm to those who would comply. In my mind, student choice is often confused with compliance to teacher direction. If the goal of school is compliance to authority then penalties for choosing not to practice make sense.
On the other hand, if the issue is “choice” then practice should be a choice without a penalty–if the benefit of practice is clear–for example, improved learning–the students would choose to practice without coercion. I don’t believe that not assigning homework restricts students from making a choice to practice at home–it just doesn’t penalize students for whatever reason are unable to do so.
Here’s an analogy: improved teaching benefits from professional development within the workplace. As professionals, teachers should choose–without any additional pay–to participate in regular improvement of practice (Since many teachers only work 7 hour days–1 hour extra daily sounds a reasonable requirement for professional development.) There’s little doubt that this sort of choice would improve the quality of teaching–after all practice makes perfect. To carry the analogy a little further into the ridiculous, let’s say that teachers who choose not to improve would be faced with failure (firing)–I’m sure we wouldn’t hear any whining.
(I may be guilty of exaggerating one side of an argument to make a point–apologies if it seems that way.)
I don’t agree that choice and compliance are confused. I think the responsibilities of teacher and student are confused, particularly in the United States of happy endings achieved by any means necessary.
The teacher’s job is to create opportunities, provide support and to be a mirror of student response to those opportunities and support. The student’s job is to accept or reject opportunities and to find themselves in the mirror of the teacher. There are always choices and consequences. The teacher who resists being a meaningful source of opportunity and consequences is merely being an inadequate teacher and a weak mirror.
As to the issue of professional development, teachers should always be in the mode of developing their craft, renewing themselves, etc. However, whether they do so or not has no bearing on their obligation to their students.
I totally agree with you in regards to assigning homework. I teach in a Title l school where the students are on their own at home most of the time. They rarely complete the homework if they need help while doing it there is no one there to help. Only my students that earn A’s and B’s consistently do their homework and like you say they don’t really need it.
Dan, I tend to agree with your philosophy for low achievers in your comments to Marcie “in my interview last fall at my current school, they asked and I (extreeeemely hesitantly) told, summarizing much of this post. They knew I would be teaching their lowest Algebra classes and both the math dept. head and the principal agreed with the philosophy. We all kind of put it out there, though, that higher level of mathematics, with a more committed clientèle can often derive some good from homework.” I do think homework has a place even for the lowest math students. It should help them not frustrate them. They can do a few problems where the correct answers can be checked in the back of the book or on a site like hotmath.com. The homework can be graded for effort and not for correctness.
For gifted / competitive students, there is value to homework. Class time should be spent not just on examples, it should include time for peer to peer collaboration and enrichment activities. Homework for these students reveals their level of understanding and, with the right assignment, how far they can take a concept. All homework is not bad. Homework must be geared to the audience – as with everything we teachers do every day. I hate for parents to read headlines like “Whi I don’t assign homework” … it makes those of us who do look like we are behind the times – and we are not!
As a parent and a teacher, I think homework is important–not so much that students should ever have to go to their parents.
I have taught college courses, high school courses, and middle school courses. Students who are hoping to advance to college will need to develop independent learning and time management skills. They will have to learn to learn outside the classroom.
Meanwhile, I discourage parental help–I know the parents can pass middle school, high school and often college courses; the question is, can the kids? Without homework, some kids cruise through the course discussions and exercises, believing that they understand the material and then BAM! the test hits them with surprising results/
Homework in skills/practice is a small way of preparing students for the tests–there should not be an overwhelming amount, but enough so that they can realistically assess their progress before there is anything significant on the gradebook.
Reading the literature can sometimes be done in class, but often needs to be done at home. Students read at different rates and it is an inefficient use of classtime to use all of it reading when some of it needs to be used on writing skills development and the discussion of literature.
While I agree homework should never be a substitute for teacher planning, I do believe it has its place.
I dont understand? Why would you give a student 40 problems if they dont get it. then they would just get in the habit of doing it wrong because they did it wrong 40 times.
Practice is important. You give homework so that students can practice the skill they’re learning. What skill doesn’t need to be practiced? Music? Art? Writing? Reading? Mathematics? Drama? Athletics? They all need practice. No matter how organized you are, students need the opportunity to build their own muscle in an area. A master class is a way to point practice, not in lieu of doing your own work.
My feeling is that if the student knows the material backwards and forwards and can gain nothing from practice, then you’re not teaching enough. If your classes are so hetereogeneous that you have students who are completely wasting their time in class then the problem isn’t homework, the problem is a flawed system that puts too great a range of ability and preparedness in one place. In that case, not giving work to those who are already not being challenged in class is just compounding the injustice.
Practice is important if they are practicing! I teach a very low level 6th grade intensive math class. To get them to do any type of homework is like pulling teeth. So, when I do assign homework, it consist of only 3 to 4 problems.
I really like what you have to say Dan. Like many edu articles I read, I think your ideas are sound. Now I want to see exactly how your class unfolds – a step by step lesson plan that shows how you make sure each moment is used most effectively – and then I want to see how you could do it in the 50 minute periods I have in my school. Would you be willing to share? Notes are great, but a veido would be amazing.
Ann, I’d like to record some lessons if for nothing else to put something on my hard drive for posterity. I need to figure out some release issues with my students and then I’ll start recording a few classes.
Why I don’t assign Homework- I found this blog very interesting. I am torn about this topic. How much is too much. Is it really helpful. I teach 5th grade. I do wish my 5th graders would read a little bit more than watch TV. I liked reading the opinions of other teachers. Thank you
I am a teacher with almost 30 years to my credit. I’ve changed my views about homework dramatically. Homework, given for the right reasons and in a fair amount, is justified. However, loading students down with enormous amounts of work outside of school is counterproductive and just plain wrong! Do we as adults come home from work and say to ourselves, “Oh, I can’t wait to think, think, think, work, work, work, some more!” The human as well as the human brain deserves some rest. Now, having said that, if we could somehow get our students in “ready to learn mode” when they walk in the door, this discussion would be moot. Unfortunately, we get our students, warts and all. Much time is wasted with discipline issues.
Thanks for this – I’m the Secondary Math Content Curator for Teach for America. I’m doing a blog post about homework for math teachers, and this will be a great addition. I’ll be sure to link to you so that the teachers can read what you have to say.
“Secondary Math Content Curator”? Are you sure that’s your job and not, say, a paid hobby? Sounds like an incredible way to spend your work week, regardless. Stop by again sometime and say hi.
For several years now I have assigned homework 3-4 nights a week for the students. I have developed a partern 3 questions about what we did that day and 3 questions about something in the past or something we will do in the future. I have found the previewing to be extremely helpfull in exposing simple skill sets that might be needed for new concepts. Example linear equations in standard form and calculating the intercepts from that form. I write instructions how to work each set of problems. Now for the challenging part getting them to complete the homework. My class is divided into teams they compete for rewards at the end of certain time periods. They never know when the homework will be for a grade or for team points. This motivates them.
This is obviously where Mr. Cox had come up with all his ideas about “homework being pointless”. I have a B in Algebra, and it will never go up because I can’t do homework, and Mr. Cox doesn’t collect anything.
I’m finishing my fourth year of teaching and am constantly toying with the idea of doing away with homework. One of the issues I run into is not having the instructional time to get everything done so somethings have to go home. In essence, I hope for the best on those things, knowing that many students won’t complete them or will cheat.
I also struggle with the question of preparing students for their future jobs. Many jobs require students to be self directed and to take work home. By excusing them from the ritual of homework, do we cripple them in the future?
You talked about poor classroom management as one of the reasons why teachers give homework. Then go on to explain that kids don’t do the work anyway (the ones that need the help the most do the least) so don’t give them homework. These seem like rationals to tell yourself that homework is useless so why assign it. I have never been one to assign tons of homework, maybe two times a week. But the quality of homework is extremely important, I feel. Sure doing pages out of the text might not be the most engaging or useful of time, it does serve a purpose to reinforce major concepts to get the students prepared for statewide test so that they can graduate. But homework in the form of projects that develop creativity, inventiveness, and ingenuity expands upon what I can do in class and gives the students the freedom to create fantastic results that build upon what was taught in class. I don’t see homework as a dinosaur in today’s world, but as a useful changing tool that is still important if you want the next generation to build upon the successes of this country.
Do what you have to do to teach/survive/feel you’re making a difference. No one “religion” fits all. Keep is simple simon.
I sometimes feel that homework is just work for the parents to do with their child/children. Sometimes, I don’t see the relevance in the work that is assigned to do at home. In our district, homework is suppose to be a practice not work to be learned at home. It is also not suppose to take too long to complete. The kids who do the homework are usually the ones who really don’t need the extra practice. The kids who don’t do the work are usually the ones in need of some practice. A lot of times, the students who don’t do the homework to get the extra practice, are the ones who don’t have family involved in their education. They are usually taking care of themseles.
No w.end HW- need time to play but all previous week work is due by Mon. so the one’s who didn’t do it have w.end HW.
C.Prep – outside class work: studying for quizzes/tests, the occasional research topic, and reading assignments related to class work.
I try to minimize cheating by not handing back assignments until after the due date and not giving assignments that are easily copied. If they do, I speak to the individuals, show them a copy of the state university policy on plagiarism, and explain to them they have to become independent workers, looking to friends for help but doing their own work.
I ask the athletes if they tell others they got the winning goal etc. if their teams wins and point out that cheating is the same as lying so if they wouldn’t lie about their performance, don’t cheat.
I agree with the no homework idea. Most of the parents are not at home to help the students with the homework if they have any questions. The student will not understand it and get mad and not do it.
Summer is a time for trips to the beach, barbecuing, and experiencing the most from the outdoors! There doesn't seem to be many downsides to summertime, however, it is so easy to get into the habit of throwing your hair up into a ponytail on especially warm days. At Kitsch, we want to give you some alternatives to the classic ponytail so we are going to show you how to do a french braid.
The french braid is a stylish braid that looks complex, but is actually quite easy to achieve. We like how french braids look great in a variety of occasions and Kitsch Hair Ties has a large assortment of colors for any type of event. We also recommend using one of our headbands along with a french braid for when you want the hair out of your face but still want to look stylish. Grab a friend and try these fool-proof directions or practice this beautiful french braid on your own hair!
1. Comb through the hair and make sure it is free of knots. (Kitsch tip: Freshly washed hair is not the best for
2. Towards the top of your hair, gather about a third of your hair as if you are doing a half-up ponytail.
3. After you have gathered this section, separate into 3 sections. Two sections should fall between your thumb and pointer finger, one for each hand, and the 3rd section can go to whichever hand you want. 4. Now, begin to do a regular braid, crossing the right piece over the middle piece, and then the left piece over the new middle piece.
5. After you have moved the left piece over the middle, pull a smaller section of hair from the right side of the head and add it to the right piece. You should then braid regularly until you are ready to cross the left piece over the middle. When this happens you should again, take a smaller section from the left side of the head and put it with the left piece. Continue this process.
We love incorporating multiple ties into all types of braids, including the french braid. You can achieve this unique look in a french braid by adding a Kitsch hair tie into one of three sections of the braid (we recommend doing this where the hairline stops on your neck). This look instantly spices up your French braid and is great because you can show off two colors. Using a glitter tie along with a pastel or one of our basic colors is a fun and chic look in your french braid. We guarantee you'll be receiving compliments left and right on your french braid with this uniquely Kitsch look!

Last week was Eat Cheap Week where a lot of restaurants offered great deals through BtownMenus so you can indulge in a lot of food, for cheap. On Friday, I chose to order from CHOMP, which I haven’t tried before. I had my friend come over that night and we were starved, so we completely scarfed down the food quickly but it was delicious.
CHOMP offered 2 burgers or chicken sandwiches, 2 drinks and an appetizer for about $15. What is great about CHOMP is that they use local farms for their meat, with their beef and pork coming from Fischer Farms and their poultry from Miller Farms. From that, they’ve crafted a menu with a wide variety of options. And if you’re getting together with friends, you could get other good carryout or delivery deals from BtownMenus like 4 burgers or chicken sandwiches for $24.
What I ordered from CHOMP was The Whole Farm burger complete with a fried egg, cheddar cheese and bacon and topped with a pretzel roll bun. My friend ordered the Cream and Crimson burger which includes garlic, parmesan, sautéed red pepper, chipotle mayonnaise and mozzarella underneath a hamburger bun. We split an order of hand-dipped fried pickles and each had Pepsis. With the burgers and sandwiches you can order different kinds of rolls or buns, and add on toppings as well. Even the fries have a variety of seasonings.
I thought CHOMP was a good mix of using their menu specialties and customizing your meal to your taste; the choices weren’t overwhelming.

Hilite have been operating for more than twenty years and are recognised as the UK's premier list broker in the gambling and health sectors. Testament to their quality of service is that they are appointed sole broker for more than 150 lists and have longstanding relationships with many of the data owners.
All 100+ lists were held separately which made 'top-ups' across lists slow and in most cases just not possible.
List updates would typically arrive within a short space of time with no uniformity of data content or format.
Turnaround times for updates needed to be reduced and more new records made available sooner for orders.
A cost effective solution was sought that would address all Hilite's needs without impacting on margins.
A single database designed and built that housed all lists and provided actionable information regarding dupe rates across lists.
Fully automated update processes developed that included screening out erroneous data, adding new records and updating existing records.
Comprehensive reports designed to provide varying levels of detail (from topline summary right down to full audit on each list).
'Top-up' orders were immediately actionable which, in turn, yielded revenue previously not achieved.
Update turnaround times were substantially reduced, by 75%, making more new data available for orders.
Consumer Net are a claims management company, specialising in winning back unfair PPI charges from banks and financial institutions. Every month they process up to ten thousand claim applications on behalf of their customers.
With hundreds of applications being received every day the amount of administrative work equated to three full-time personnel at the main UK office.
All applications received had to be matched back to the CRM system, relevant details recorded and then information fed out to relevant parties.
On very busy days, typically Monday's, a backlog of applications would occur meaning processing not completed until the next day.
Aim was to submit the applications to the relevant bank or financial institution same day they were received.
A high speed scanner installed at Consumer Net's offices that allowed applications received each day to be quickly scanned and images saved.
'Mirroring' system set-up that securely copied images from client site to our own servers that allowed required processing to be undertaken.
Process flow of the administrative processes was discussed and agreed with the client and training of our personnel undertaken.
5 personnel undertook the training, one supervisor and four processors to provide sufficient cover and uninterrupted service.
Personnel at client site, previously engaged in the administrative activities, were allocated to other revenue producing tasks.
Cohort Global is Australia's leading online lead generation company. With their clients' continued success, Cohort has enjoyed rapid expansion and recently opened a UK office in London. Using proprietary technology, combined with good old fashioned service, Cohort has been at the forefront of digital marketing and targets to be the benchmark for lead generation, and consent marketing.
Cohort wanted to partner with an outsourcing company to streamline and give full support to their email broadcast process. Doing so would give them leverage in terms of focused resources on their core strengths. The hurdles were:
Migration of the whole email broadcast campaign process and procedures to an offshore partner without disruption to current operations.
After several planning sessions in Sydney and Manila, with the Australian broadcast team, solutions below were proposed:
Creation and collaboration with a transition team dedicated to support all areas of current campaigns.
Creation of a Manila team to manage, support, administer and evaluate the loading and management of campaigns to their online email platform.
Remote email campaign administration with provision for responsive design and html and front end html creative work.
Increased campaign accuracy to 99.5% (errors reduced to just 0.50%). Employed operational solutions to prevent issues from reocurring.
100% on-time daily delivery of campaigns with corresponding reports and resulting audit trail for accountability.
FT.Com are the largest international publisher of financial on-line content, newsletters and country/market specific analysis. Through their network of financial journalists they have a reputation for having their finger on the pulse. They use their enquiry and subscription information, via an SCV, to promote vertically.
FT.com Faststats (FS) loads were not being completed on time, in excess of 40% failing to be available by 9 a.m. As a result their campaign strategy became a tactical entrenchment. Without reliable, up to date delivery of their core consumer data, sales opportunities were lost.
Critical data was being collected and needed to be added to the SCV and FS without missing the daily 9 a.m. publish.
Straight forward. Establish what exists and the set-up. Then apply the necessary changes. All ETL and FS work was done by remote access to FT.com host solution.

Set in the near future, humanity enters another energy revolution following the discovery of Photon Power. Derived from the ore discovered under the foothills of Mt. Fuji, its intended use was to solve the world's energy problems with its unimaginable power. Seeking this energy is Dr. Hell, a madman craving world domination who with his subordinates Baron Ashura, Count Brocken and Viscount Pygman, commands an army of mechanical beasts excavated from the ruins of ancient Greece to seize the Photon Power Lab for himself. Meeting the attack head on is the hot-blooded teenager Kabuto Kouji, who pilots the Photon Powered robot built by his grandfather, Mazinger Z. But in this battle between Dr. Hell and the Kabuto family, many legends surrounding the Mycenaean Civilization and Bardos Island, as well as the secrets of Mazinger Z remain shrouded in mystery.
A new series based on the mecha show that started it all, Mazinger Z. Shin Mazinger Shougeki! Z-Hen starts over from the beginning with a new cast, to tell a new story unrelated to the original show.

I got to meet this cute little guy this morning. He was a little serious, but oh-so-handsome! Big sister was super proud and quite the helper. Here’s a quick sneak peek for Mom!

Last weekend the entire Bella Bobbin Brigade took a trip away to West Wittering for a long weekend camping. We had a brilliant time, truly blessed with some lovely weather and 4 children who thoroughly enjoyed the freedom of running around like lunatics!
West Wittering beach is a glorious patch of sand (patch is abit of an understatement - it stretches for miles!) with 156 lovely beach-huts running along the back by the sand dunes. Parking charges were slightly eyebrow raising (Mr Bobbin, a bean counter by trade, spent most of the day mumbling about daylight robbery!).
Quite sad to be home now, though we do have lots of lovely new creations to show you inspired by our time away!
It's been a while - I know!! School holidays are keeping both myself and Sarah very busy (and not at all close to loosing the plot!?*!)
We are all off Camping together in Sussex tomorrow, I shall take my trusty camera with me and share the snaps when I return. I am hoping that I can sneak some bunting up onto the tent this time (Mr Bobbin put his foot down last time - but I'm not going to let a minor thing like that get in my way!!)
Crafting has had to take a bit of a back-seat the last few months for me, the girls are growing fast and I'm concious of making the most of the time they will be a home with me. My eldest is starting school in September - can't believe how quickly the time has flown! Any tips for keeping it together on the 1st day of school?!?
Sarah on the other hand has been super organised and has been busy crafting away, making some lovely items that I hope to be able to show to you soon.
Bella Bobbin is still ticking along, albeit in a slightly lower gear at the moment, we are even on the Folksy Featured Page today - it's all about 'Shrooms! (and subsequently I now want to purchase every featured item on the page!!):
Have you heard of WowThankYou? We have just recently started selling our wares on the fantastic newly revamped site. It promotes UK Crafts and Design and is a brilliant place to find unique and wonderful gifts. There are many talented people showcased on WowThankYou and we are really, really pleased to be amongst a such high standard of creations - why not pop over and take a look -
We have also been lucky enough to be featured in the latest WowThankYou Newsletter which we are over the moon about:
We have been very busy of late and the Bella Bobbin store is filling up very nicely. I thought I would share with you a few pictures of the items we have been working on over the last few months / weeks. We have been feeling quite Summery of late and inspired by the Great British Seaside -
Our shop is really starting to come together and we are both really pleased with it. We will be launching our products in a new online store tomorrow (more details to come, I'm desperately trying to get everything uploaded at the moment!) and another new store in July.
This Saturday we will be attending the Basingstoke Garden and Craft Fair, fingers crossed for nice weather, we are in a marquee but most of the event is outside so hopefully sunshine will bring visitors. Rumour has it that Alan Titchmarsh himself attended last year, so I shall be on the lookout for Gardening Celebrities with my camera at the ready!!
When I saw these lovely mini eggs in M&S I knew they deserved something far greater than being gobbled up straight away! So I set to work making them into Easter Egg Nest Cakes. Plain old fairy cake, some butter-cream icing, a grated up flake to make the twigs and a gorgeous egg on the top. Yummy!
Last year we bought the little Bobbins a playhouse for the back garden. I spent literally weeks shopping around, trying to get the perfect one for our budget and to suit the girls. I would have loved to have gone for a two storey mansion but safety (I didn't want to have to supervise them constantly) and Mr Bobbin putting his foot down put paid to that!
When it eventually arrived Mr Bobbin spent hours digging up the grass and soil and laying a patio for it to sit on and then a good few more hours putting it together and this was the finished article:
The idea was to paint it, I spent hour upon hour deciding upon the colours and we went out and bought the paint. And then, well then nothing! we didn't get round to painting it at all last year.
I wanted it to look a little bit like a beach hut, which I think it does! I have a few bits of painting to tidy up and some curtains and bunting to make.
I have almost convinced Mr Bobbin that we need little white picket fencing around it (we have lots of the white paint left over and he's a waste not want not kind of guy!) I also need to get to the garden centre and get some pretty flowers for it. Then it's on to the interior! Not sure what I can do with such a small space but I will certainly have a go!!
Firstly, thank you for all your lovely comments about our stall, I really value your opinions and I know we are going in the right direction when my bloggy friends approve!
Now, what's new? Well, we have lots of lovely new items in our shop and I will dedicate a post to that very, very soon. We have also opened a "Destash Shop" called Bobbins Destash, so all you fabric addicts out there, pop over and take a look (I always feel less guilty but just as joyful buying a scrap pack of fabric!). We have 6 variations listed at the moment, with more to follow, along with other crafty surplus that is threatening to take over our craft rooms!
We have had lots of lovely promotion in the last few weeks, and a few blog awards as well. I shall also be writing a separate post on these very, very soon!
I am one half of the Bella Bobbin crafting duo. Days are spent creating, dreaming, making....who am I kidding - the days are spent trying to keep the little Bobbins from destroying the homestead, crafting time is precious in this house!!

A few cold days and shivering kids were my wake up call to start thinking about warm winterplans. Hot water bottle covers had been on our wishlist for quite some time already. Nothing beats warming up in bed with a book and a warm water bottle after coming home cold and wet from school (Dutch kids cycle, you know...).
Kyle Riggs is snatched by an alien spacecraft sometime after midnight. The ship is testing everyone it catches and murdering the weak. The good news is that Kyle keeps passing tests and staying alive. The bad news is the aliens who sent this ship are the nicest ones out there....
A novel of military science fiction by bestselling author B. V. Larson, SWARM is the story of Earth’s annexation by an alien empire. Long considered a primitive people on a backwater planet, humanity finds itself in the middle of a war, and faced with extinction.
After centuries in stasis, a lost task force returns home. Arriving from the infinite void the surviving ships discover that the Imperium lies in ruin. The Homeworld itself is destroyed, and nothing lives in the Ancestral System except an infestation of unknown bipedal beings--creatures soft, red of blood and warm of flesh... When you colonize a planet, make sure the owners aren't coming back... MECH is the story of a new Earth colony built upon the ancient Homeworld of a civilization presumed (incorrectly) to be long dead.
In the twentieth century Earth sent probes, transmissions and welcoming messages to the stars. Unfortunately, someone noticed.
The Galactics arrived with their battle fleet in 2052. Rather than being exterminated under a barrage of hell-burners, Earth joined their vast Empire. Swearing allegiance to our distant alien overlords wasn't the only requirement for survival. We also had to have something of value to trade, something that neighboring planets would pay their hard-earned credits to buy. As most of the local worlds were too civilized to have a proper army, the only valuable service Earth could provide came in the form of soldiers...someone had to do their dirty work for them, their fighting and dying.
A century ago our star erupted, destroying Earth’s wormhole network and closing off trade with her colonized planets. After being out of contact with the younger worlds for so many years, Humanity is shocked when a huge ship appears at the edge of the Solar System. Our outdated navy investigates, both curious and fearful.
What they learn from the massive vessel shocks the planet. The lost colonies have survived—but the reunion isn’t going to be a happy one. Our descendants are vastly superior in the art of warfare. Worse, there are other beings undreamed of beyond the human frontier: strange, unfathomable…alien.
Battle Cruiser Defiant, the first capital ship to darken Earth’s skies, is tasked with exploring new passages to the younger planets. Old Earth must reunite with her children…but can humanity survive the inevitable conflicts? Captain William Sparhawk, determined to follow a path of honor and truthfulness, dares to rise to the challenge.
A star cluster in the constellation of Orion rotates once every thousand years. Those who rule there have an ancient tradition: When each cycle ends, they train their fleets by spilling the blood of lesser beings.
The enemy fleets are coming again. In response, the Rebel Worlds gather their starships to face the terrifying threat, and this time humanity is asked to stand with them.
One man is chosen to command Earth's single ship in the Rebel Fleet. When the war breaks out, Leo Blake must win it… or die trying.
The Hundred Worlds have withstood invasion by the relentless Hok for decades. The human worlds are strong, but the Hok have the resources of a thousand planets behind them, and their fleets attack in endless waves.
The long war has transformed the Hundred Worlds into heavily fortified star systems. Their economies are geared for military output, and they raise specialized soldiers to save our species. Assault Captain Derek Straker is one such man among many. Genetically sculpted to drive a mech-suit as if he wears a second skin, he must find a path to victory.
It's a battle in which he'll never admit defeat, but not even Straker knows the dark truth behind this titanic struggle. With Lieutenant Carla Engels piloting, Starship Liberator explores enemy territory in search of answers.

“I write first drafts with only the good angel on my shoulder, the voice that approves of everything I write. This voice doesnt ask questions like, Is this good? Is this a poem? Are you a poet? I keep this voice at a distance, letting only the good angel whisper to me: Trust yourself. You cant worry a poem into existence.”
“I feel like I'm stuck in a bad movie, with a little devil sitting on one shoulder and an angel on the other. But the goddamn devil is twice the size and my angel is a fucking mute. Great, I have a fucking mute angel.”
“They say that shoulder blades are where your wings were, when you were an angel," she said. "They say they're where your wings will grow again one day.”
“Long ago, I believed that, given a choice, peple would turn to good as they would turn to light. I believed that reporting-honest, unflinching pictutes of the truth-could be a becon to lead us to deamand that worongs be righted, injustices puniches, and the weak and inncoent cared for. I must have believed, when I started out, that the shoulder of public opinion could be put up against the door of public indifference and would, when given the proper direction, shove it wide with the power of wanting to stand on the side of angel. (Frances Bard)”
“When you drive down Cemetery Road, the angel appears to be looking directly at you. Yet once you pass the monument and look back over your shoulder, the angel is still looking at you. Thus the appellation: the Turning Angel.”
“Somewhere, the imaginary little shoulder angel and devil were having a conversation on their respective sides, the angel offering a gentle warning that this might not be a good idea, given all the drama, the complications. But the little devil, with its pudgy belly and pointy ears, was so comical that Holly almost laughed when he rolled his eyes at the angel and whispered, "Oh, whatever".”
“Something's different," Carlos continued. "Tonight you came in with no scowling or growling. Why the
Robby shrugged one shoulder. "I'm trying to convince you I'm no' crazy. If I kept doing the same thing when it
"Good point." Carlos rinsed the bowl and placed it in the dishwasher. "So you're trying a new strategy tonight."
He growled low in his throat, his forehead dropping another inch toward her shoulder, his hair tickling the side of her face. "Be my angel, Riley, not my siren. Don't tempt me."
Moistening her lips with a sweep of her tongue, Riley glided her fingers over his belt, tracing the strip of leather to the silver buckle in the center. She felt rather than heard his deep inhalation and the tremor that raked his powerful body. Driven by his surrender, she used two fingers to walk over the square carvings etched into his abdomen, biting her lip to stop the grin that pulled when he groaned.
"I want to be both for you, Octavian," she whispered, letting her lips brush the curve of his shoulder.”
“I want you to tell me why you have a pair of broken angel wings on your shoulder. I want you to tell me why you cut your wrists and I want to know why and how you play and sing the way you do, but most of all I want you to tell me what I need to do to be a good enough man for you.”
“In Paris the swaying lanterns are lit in the streets; lights shine through water, fuzzy, diffuse. Saint-Just sits by an insufficient fire, in a poor light. He is a Spartan after all, and Spartans don't need home comforts. He has begun his report, his list of accusations; if Robespierre saw it now, he would tear it up, but in a few days' time it will be the very thing he needs. Sometimes he stops, half-glances over his shoulder. He feels someone has come into the room behind him; but when he allows himself to look, there is nothing to see. It is my destiny, he feels, forming in the shadows of the room. It is the guardian angel I had, long ago when I was a child. It is Camille Desmoulins, looking over my shoulder, laughing at my grammar. He pauses for a moment. He thinks, there are no living ghosts. He takes hold of himself. Bends his head over his task. His pen scratches. His strange letterforms incise the paper. His handwriting is minute. He gets a lot of words to the page.”
“I've never had an angel on my right shoulder; I was born with a pointy-tailed devil, who crept back and forth across my neck to get his whispers into both my ears.”
“Jill told me that when you're really in love, you know right away. I'm not exactly sure how this happens. Is it like a flash of lightning? Like an angel tapping you on the shoulder? Or is it similar to choosing a puppy? You think you're picking the cutest one, but really you wind up going home with the one who keeps insisting on climbing into your lap.”
“I still don't like my freckles," I said desperately, trying to stop myself from falling completely under his spell. "Angel kisses." Corbin dropped a soft, open-mouthed kiss on my bare shoulder where there was a cluster of freckles. "That is what we used to call them. They're beautiful, just like the rest of you, Addison.”
“And yet, even as I made these plans, there was a small dismayed corner of my heart. Like those stupid cartoons when you're a kid: little red devil on one shoulder and the little angel in his nightie on the other. My good angel was hiding his eyes.”
But you see, I am in a similar situation. I do not control the little devil sitting on my left shoulder. The devil is saying, "PRINT THE PICTURE PRINT THE PICTURE TAPE IT UP ALL OVER SCHOOL DO IT DO IT DO IT." And then on my right shoulder, there is a little tiny white angel. And the angel is saying, "Man, I sure as shit hope all those freshmen get their money bright and early on Monday morning." So do I, little angel. So do I.
“But you see, I am in a similar situation. I do not control the little devil sitting on my left shoulder. The devil is saying, "PRINT THE PICTURE PRINT THE PICTURE TAPE IT UP ALL OVER SCHOOL DO IT DO IT DO IT." And then on my right shoulder, there is a little tiny white angel. And the angel is saying, "Man, I sure as **** hope all those freshmen get their money bright and early on Monday morning."
“Shuttered like a fan no-one suspects your shoulder blades of wings. While you lay on your belly I kneaded the hard edges of your flight. You are a fallen angel but still as the angels are; body light as a dragonfly, great gold wings cut across the sun.”
“She had fallen asleep with her head on his arm, the clockwork angel, still around her throat, resting against his shoulder just to the left of his collarbone. As she moved away, the clockwork angel slipped free and she saw to her surprise that where it had lain against his skin it had left a mark behind, no bigger than a shilling, in the shape of a pale white star.”
“The Archangel." I murmured. looking back over my shoulder at the ride, which had started its next ascent.
"It means high-ranking angel." There was a definite smugness to his voice. "The higher up, the harder the fall.”
“When you are lonely or frightened, talk to your guardian angel. You can do it out loud or inside your head, your angel can hear you. Ask your angel to be near you, to put his or her hand on your shoulder, to give you courage and protect you.”
“I write first drafts with only the good angel on my shoulder, the voice that approves of everything I write. This voice does'nt ask questions like, Is this good? Is this a poem? Are you a poet? I keep this voice at a distance, letting only the good angel whisper to me: Trust yourself. You can't worry a poem into existence.”
“Any other town you go to there's this little devil and a little angel on your shoulder. A little good advice, a little bad advice.You go to Las Vegas, there's like a devil and a devil and they're just battling it out the whole time. It's like, "Smoke some crack!" "Get a hooker!" And then I go, "YEA! Yea, this is a good town. Smoke some crack and get a hooker! Alright!”
“Heed not Mephistopheles, my children, lest you suffer eternal damnation. When he whispers in your ear, turn away your head and hearken instead to the angel on your shoulder.”
“My favorite track from the album Independent is Hold On. Everyone at some point fights battles or has struggles, and in moments of doubt or defeat, this is the song coming from a place of never giving up. It makes me think of the angel on the shoulder voicing understanding but guiding you in the right direction to take you out of that dark place.”
“But this is one of the things that makes rap at its best so human. It doesn't force you to pretend to be only one thing or another, to be a saint or a sinner. It recognizes that you can be true to yourself and still have unexpected dimensions and opposing ideas. Having a devil on one shoulder and an angel on the other is the most common thing in the world. The real bullshit is when you act like you don't have contradictions inside you, that you're so dull and unimaginative that your mind never changes or wanders into strange, unexpected places.”
“Throughout much of history, women writers have capitulated to male standards, and have paid too much heed to what Virginia Woolf calls "the angel in the house." She is that little ghost who sits on one's shoulder while one writes and whispers, "Be nice, don't say anything that will embarrass the family, don't say anything your man will disapprove of ... " [ellipsis in original] The "angel in the house" castrates one's creativity because it deprives one of essential honesty, and many women writers have yet to win the freedom to be honest with themselves.”
“Good luck, man." Wraith clapped him on the shoulder. "For an angel, you don't suck." "Ditto. For a demon ... well, you do suck." "Because I'm half vampire?" "Sure," Reaver said. "Let's go with that.”

“Halloween is an ancient druidic holiday, one the Celtic peoples have celebrated for millennia. It is the crack between the last golden rays of summer and the dark of winter; the delicately balanced tweak of the year before it is given over entirely to the dark; a time for the souls of the departed to squint, to peek and perhaps to travel through the gap. What could be more thrilling and worthy of celebration than that? It is a time to celebrate sweet bounty, as the harvest is brought in. It is a time of excitement and pleasure for children before the dark sets in. We should all celebrate that.”
“By planting rye I am creating carbon sinks in my backyard, expanding my role in the carbon cycle, launching my own backyard campaign to offset global warming. My emissions, after all, reflect a rural but very comfortable life in which I enjoy goods that travel great distances - clementines from Spain, wine from California - and on the occasional holiday I fly south, seeking warmer places. Will planting rye in the shoulder seasons be enough to make a difference? Certainly not, but it is a gesture, a way to frame the question and provide a benchmark to judge the extent of my complicity.”
“I don't keep a travel diary. I did keep a travel diary once and it was a big mistake. All I remember of that trip is what I bothered to write down. Everything else slipped away, as though my mind felt jilted by my reliance on pen and paper. For exactly the same reason I don't travel with a camera. My holiday becomes the snapshots and anything I forget to record is lost.”
“To live on a day-to-day basis is insufficient for human beings; we need to transcend, transport, escape; we need meaning, understanding, and explanation; we need to see over-all patterns in our lives. We need hope, the sense of a future. And we need freedom (or, at least, the illusion of freedom) to get beyond ourselves, whether with telescopes and microscopes and our ever-burgeoning technology, or in states of mind that allow us to travel to other worlds, to rise above our immediate surroundings.
We may seek, too, a relaxing of inhibitions that makes it easier to bond with each other, or transports that make our consciousness of time and mortality easier to bear. We seek a holiday from our inner and outer restrictions, a more intense sense of the here and now, the beauty and value of the world we live in.”
Halloween is not 'a yankee holiday' celebrated only by gigantic toddlers wearing baseball caps back to front and spraying 'automobiles' with eggs. This is ignorance.

“Think Indonesia and tourism, and the first thing that comes to mind is probably Bali. Think golf holiday, and most people would dream of Scotland or Ireland. But Indonesia harbors one of the best-kept secrets in the world of travel: it is a golfer's paradise.”
“What you do on travel holiday is what your memories are based on. People want to do cool stuff, and this is what will shape your entire experience.”
“For years, I had a top secret clearance and never left Russia. Just once did I go to Bulgaria with my wife for a holiday at the Golden Sands resort, but I could not mention my real name. I was allowed to travel abroad only in the early 1990s.”
“When I travel, I just take what I need and I run. I always have my briefcase stuffed with work, even when I go on a holiday.”
“Whenever I go on holiday, I like to time travel and imagine what it must have been like 500 years ago. I love the Tuscan landscape, which is reminiscent of a Claude Lorrain painting.”
“If I'm on holiday, I travel light, but if it is a work trip, I take everything but the kitchen sink.”
“Thanksgiving is an emotional holiday. People travel thousands of miles to be with people they only see once a year. And then discover once a year is way too often.”
“This is as good a time as any to comment on what I think has grown into an abuse. Congress makes holidays and every time there isa holiday it is the practice for one department to telephone over to another department and say we are going to have an extra holiday in this department and what is your department going to do about it ... If it comes on Saturday, they want a holiday on Friday, and of course they couldn't come back and travel on Sunday and so they want another holiday on Monday to get back on.”

Production Company – Panique/Radar/Savage Film/Versus/One-Eyed
Belgian director Fabrice du Welz made an extraordinary appearance a few years ago with The Ordeal (2004), which took the standard Backwoods Brutality film and threw a few twists on it to make one of the most demented screen viewing experiences that one had seen in some time. Fabrice du Welz’s follow-up to that, Vinyan (2008), concerning a couple on a journey into the jungle in search of their missing son and encountering something very strange, was made with recognisable name stars but failed to quite attain the same buzz. Alleluia was Fabrice du Welz’s third feature film. He subsequently went on to make the revenge film A Message from the King (2016).
With Alleluia, du Welz has turned to the story of Martha Beck and Raymond Fernandez. In 1947, Raymond Fernandez, a man born of Spanish parents, and Martha Beck, an overweight undertaker’s assistant, met up via the newspaper personals column. She became enamoured of him and discovered his confidence scheme where he would meet women via the personals ads and trick them out of money. She collaborated with him on these schemes and they would travel to meet the women. However, Martha was extremely jealous and began to murder the women. In 1949, they were arrested and charged with the murders of three of the women, although the number is believed to be much higher than that. Both were executed by electric chair in 1951. The story become a sensation and has fuelled a number of film treatments. The most famous of these was The Honeymoon Killers (1970) with Shirley Stohler as Martha Beck and Tony Lo Bianco as Raymond Fernandez. Other versions include Lonely Hearts (1991) starring Eric Roberts and Beverly D’Angelo as Fernandez and Beck; the Mexican-made Deep Crimson (1996), which relocates the story south of the border; and Lonely Hearts (2006) with Jared Leto and Salma Hayek filling the respective roles,
Fabrice du Welz has clearly fictionalised the Beck-Fernandez case. He moves the story from the American east coast of the late 1940s forward some fifty plus years to present-day Belgium. Despite this, many of the small details of the case are retained – Martha/Gloria’s working as an undertaker’s assistant, something that had been edited out by the other film versions; Raymond/Michel suffering from neurological damage (a result of a metal plate falling on his head) and conducting black magic rituals to enhance his power over women; the existence of Gloria’s child (children in the case of Martha) who she leaves with others when she heads off with Raymond/Michel; the third victim with her live-in daughter (who gets a nicer fate here than she did in real life).
On the other hand, there is also much that has changed. Here it becomes Martha/Gloria who is the Spanish immigrant rather than Raymond/Michel. The oddity that got me was the translation of Raymond Fernandez’s personals column seductions to modern internet dating. You keep wondering if someone like Fernandez would have the same success today on the internet that he would have had in the 1940s. On my ventures into internet dating and anecdotal evidence from various women I have spoken to, it seems to be the case of a limited pool of available women rapidly being inundated by guys sending pictures of their members, wanting instant hook-ups, or spamming everybody with poetry. In other words, it rapidly becomes an environment where most women get fed up, jaded and cynical with horny guys interested in nothing else or married men looking for extracurricular fun. Would a Raymond Fernandez be able to conduct his confidence scams in such an environment one wonders? Where there is such an available pool of men to choose would women readily fall for his scams – at least without doing some background checking?
The other major change is the fact that Martha Beck was an extremely large woman. At the time of her arrest, she weighed over 200 pounds and had clocked in at a reported 300 some years earlier. Both Lonely Hearts and Alleluia omit this fact and cast an actress of standard build; the only film version of the story to have given us an authentically BBW Martha Beck was The Honeymoon Killers and its unforgettable performance from Shirley Stohler. One is not sure the reasons for giving us a slimmed down Martha – maybe something to do with perceiving the negative box-office potential of a plus-size female lead, one suspects – however, the crucial thing it does do is change the dynamic between the two characters. Reading up on Beck, you get the impression of a rejected woman with a fiercely cold temper who was desperately clinging to the one man who had shown her proper affection in her life but was prone to psychopathic jealousy when anything threatened this. This is something that Shirley Stohler’s performance nailed to perfection. With Salma Hayek in Lonely Hearts, all you get is the impression of passion-crazed Latino firecracker. You get something very different with Lola Dueñas here. Her performance is emotionally muted, even when she is in throes of passion. So when she does abandon her comfortable but boring lifestyle or explodes out into in jealous rage, you keep wondering where this is coming from. It is not an uninteresting performance; it is just that in comparison to Stohler and Hayek, who let everything out and went for it, everything inside her seems contained and kept under cover.
The sensational nature of the material in the Beck-Hernandez case aside, Alleluia is the most controlled film that Fabrice du Welz has made to date. It is the largely mundane story of a disturbed and murderous relationship but there is none of the ventures into the strange that we had in The Ordeal and Vinyan. There are a couple of moments where the film does – one scene where Lola Dueñas has a body in the kitchen and abruptly bursts into a musical number before turning to carve the body up; another where the two engage in a frenzied primal nude dance before a bonfire. However, these scenes feel as though they have strayed in from another film altogether alongside the controlled rest of the film and you keep waiting for du Welz to return this, whereupon the puzzle becomes as to why he doesn’t and leaves two such random scenes in the film. The other oddity is the significance of the film’s title – alleluia is an alternate spelling of the more commonly used hallelujah, a Hebrew phrase that comes to us from The Bible and literally means ‘praise God’ – which seems to bear no relation to anything that happens throughout the film.

Joshua and Brittany are a dynamic duo and the perfect couple to be leading our youth into the “more” of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Together, they have been serving MorningStar Fellowship Wilmington for the last two years, both with kids ministry, as kids church teachers and youth Launch Leaders, as well as with our worship team (Joshua). Parents of two passionate and energetic young men, Noah and Braxton, they have recently added a beautiful little girl to the team, Micah Mae!
Brittany has called Wilmington her home for the last nine years. She’s originally from Orange County, NC where her family is still involved in the agricultural industry. As a kids church teacher and youth Launch Leader, she loves working with her husband at MFW and feels refreshed every time she is with the MFW community because it’s always new. Being in Wilmington gives her the opportunity to play beach volleyball, one of her favorites! But just being with family is what makes her heart come alive.
Joshua has been a Wilmington-ite for that last 28 years but is originally from Westminster, Maryland. He thoroughly enjoys being a youth Launch Leader, kids church teacher and a part of the worship ministry, but what he loves about MFW the most is, “the ability to be myself and who God created me to be with no pressure to be anything else”. For Joshua, the best parts about Wilmington are the opportunities he has to watch the moonrise at the beach and the sunset downtown. When he’s not doing that, he’s soaking in the Lord’s pleasure while surfing, playing tennis, or enjoying a cup of coffee while reading a good book.
Both Joshua and Brittany are an integral part of MorningStar Fellowship Wilmington. They love being a part of MFW because of the diversity of its congregation, it’s commitment to community, and that the people have an “ability to forsake all that’s comfortable to pursue the Lord.” No one is excluded, everyone is welcome!
Becoming a private landlord should not be seen as an easy way of making money. It can be riskier and more complicated. It can also be very time consuming, more than most forms of investment, and there is no guarantee that house prices will rise. That said, having a second property to let to tenants could reap considerable financial rewards over time.
Rent Potential - the decision as to whether or not a mortgage will be offered is usually based on the rent you will earn as well as your income. In some cases your income is not ever considered.
Larger Deposit - typically a minimum of 20% or 25% of the property's value is required as a deposit.
When buying a second property to let, you will need to decide whether your primary objective is income or capital growth. In other words, are you looking to make a profit month on month or are you looking to make a profit through increased equity from the second property if it increases in value over time? The decision may affect the type of property you purchase, and the location.
When you manage a property there are many costs involved in addition to the monthly mortgage repayments. As a guide, you should be aiming to achieve a gross rent of about 135% of the rental property's interest only mortgage repayments in order to cover your costs should anything go wrong.
Letting agent's fees - letting agents charge around 10% of the monthly rent for finding and vetting tenants with an additional cost of around 5% if you require a full management service.
Legal insurance - to cover costs from evicting tenants in the event of non-payment, very important, as this can be very expensive.
Insurance - building insurance and contents insurance for the items provided as part of the rental agreement.
Furnishings - the purchase of any furniture. If the property is to be let furnished, make sure you are covered for this by your home insurance.
Gas / electrical appliances - cost of maintaining appliances and ensuring they comply with any regulations such as safety tests.
Decorating costs - the property may require work ranging from painting, to a new bathroom suite before it is suitable for letting to tenants.
When choosing a property to let, it is wise to take advice from local letting agents to determine; what types of properties are in need and which parts of the town are best or most wanted. They can tell you if there is a University in the town, and if students are looking for somewhere to live.

A growing number of people in Obamacare are finding out their health insurance plans will disappear from the program next year, forcing them to find new coverage even as options shrink and prices rise.At least 1.4 million people in 32 states will lose the Obamacare plan they have now, according to state officials contacted by Bloomberg. That’s largely caused by Aetna Inc., UnitedHealth Group Inc. and some state or regional insurers quitting the law’s markets for individual coverage.Sign-ups for Obamacare coverage begin next month. Fallout from the quitting insurers has emerged as the latest threat to the law, which is also a major focal point in the U.S. presidential election. While it’s not clear what all the consequences of the departing insurers will be, interviews with regulators and insurance customers suggest that plans will be fewer and more expensive, and may not include the same doctors and hospitals.It may also mean that instead of growing in 2017, Obamacare could shrink. As of March 31, the law covered 11.1 million people; an Oct. 13 S&P Global Ratings report predicted that enrollment next year will range from an 8 percent decline to a 4 percent gain.

To the new year and Christmas holidays are turned into trouble for your Pets, be aware of some precautions.
If the house cat, it is not necessary to decorate the Christmas tree or tinsel rain. Cats love to play with Christmas decorations, and they can be swallowed – especially attracted by the rain. Such incidents are dangerous for the animal. Is that the cat itself gets rid of the whole lump of rain with vomiting. But most of the rain in the sky, in a long thread across the intestine and you can only get him surgically.
Fireworks – the whole ordeal for some dogs. Since the holidays we have delayed for a long time, particularly susceptible animals is carried out in tension for one week. To prepare for the New year your pet using homeopathic remedies. For example, the use of the drug phosphorus-Homaccord will reduce the excitability of the dog. But to start it should be about a month before the New year.
Other dogs rather like to hunt for firecrackers. Running up too close to them, the dog can get a concussion, injury, burns or even injuries. It is better to leave your dog at home when you go to launch fireworks.
In the winter, don’t forget to monitor your Pets ‘ paws – dog walking on city streets often suffer from dermatitis of the pads because of the special road chemicals and salt. To avoid this, wear dogs shoes or after each outing, rinse paws with soap and water and lubricate emollients. At the pet store you can buy a special balm for paws.
As part of our Graduate Residency Programme, supporting LCC graduates in the rapid development of innovative projects which have the potential for significant social change or economic impact, we’re catching up with the progress of the 4 projects.
Jessie is from London. They graduated from LCC’s MA Photography course in 2016. Jessie’s residency project explores social art practice, sport and intersectional identity, radical potential for supporting and empowering queer (non-normative) communities, helping queer and opening up the institution to a more diverse student base and challenging assumptions and practices.
We caught up with Jessie to find out more about their practice and what they’re working on as part of the Graduate Residency Programme…
I work part-time so I am able to pay my rent, my bills, support myself. I have a small studio close to my home in North London and have been involved in a number of exhibitions and projects since graduating including working with and/or presenting work at Tate, Live Art Development Agency, Whitechapel Gallery, University of Oxford, Goldsmiths University, Queens Museum New York, Norwich Arts Centre, RichMix, Space in Between Gallery, Five Years, SPACE.
I am an amateur artist and amateur footballer with no sporting ambition beyond doing excellent kick ups in the park. I work from a queer brown – sometimes sad – perspective, foregrounding emotional experiences and proposing these as valid methods of research. My work is often social in approach and crosses various mediums including performance, film, writing, websites and drawing.
I’d like to use my LCC Graduate Residency to think about queerness, and create opportunities for others to engage in acts of ‘queering’, without me dictating how this might look. I will use my time at LCC to stage opportunities to queer with the hope of learning from what people create and do. In other words, I hope to experience other people’s queering strategies, and create a conversation between these and my own queering strategies.
I will borrow from my favourite aesthetic, sport and sporting paraphernalia, to frame the conversation, because I see sport and art as having very similar possibilities, and I think merging the 2 creates interesting parallels and conversations around dominant narratives and queer possibility.
I love listening to music as I work, if I’m writing I listen to one song on repeat, or music without lyrics – usually classical although I don’t know much about classical music, I would like to know more. If I’m not writing, I might listen to any of the below, but it will tend to be songs and albums I already know, so it doesn’t pull my attention away entirely from what I’m doing. I save listening to new music for the washing up, cleaning, travelling on the bus etc.
In song lyrics, in poetry, in texts from friends, in the things people share on Facebook and Twitter, in my best friend who is a wonderful writer, artist, glitter butch stud.
The market and the shopping centre, the pubs we used to go to – one of which has since changed hands, it doesn’t feel the same now. Since graduating I don’t come back to Elephant that often but when I do these places bring back strong fond memories, I love returning to them.
Yes I do, it’s very little but I believe totally perfect. I built the desk, which flips down to give a bit more room. And there’s a sink, which I’ve turned into another higher desk, because before it was a studio, it used to be a tiny toilet in somebody’s flat. It has a great window, which floods the room with light. I love it and feel very lucky to have it.
As part of the project, Jessie is looking for students and staff to send short films on being queer and moving your body to be screened at LCC. Send in clips, shorts, or links to Luminita Molico (l.molico@lcc.arts.ac.uk) with the email subject title ‘QUEERING LCC PROJECT’ – deadline 6 May 2018.

Two low-level American crooks head to Australia, where they match wits with a kangaroo (who appears to have an intellectual edge on his pursuers) in this broad comedy. Charlie Carbone (Jerry O'Connell) is a hairdresser from Brooklyn whose best friend, Louis Booker (Anthony Anderson), scrapes together a living moving stolen merchandise. Charlie's stepfather, Sal Maggio (Christopher Walken), is a crime kingpin who has loaned Charlie a lot of money and wants to know when he'll get it back; Sal's not especially fond of Louis, especially after he and Charlie accidentally lead the police to a storehouse of burgled goods owned by Sal. Charlie owes Sal a big favor, and Sal wants Charlie and Louis out of his hair for a while, so Sal sends them to Australia, where they're to deliver a large amount of cash to a mysterious Mr. Smith (Marton Csokas). En route to their meeting in the outback, Charlie and Louis accidentally run over a kangaroo, and the half-bright tourists decide to dress the dead marsupial in sunglasses and Louis' favorite jacket for snapshots. However, the animal wasn't as dead as they imagined, and it soon hops away, shortly after Louis realizes the payment to Mr. Smith was in the pocket. Now Louis and Charlie are out to find the fast-moving critter, with the help of Jessie (Estella Warren), a wildlife expert; Mr. Jimmy (David Ngoombujarra), a wilderness guide; and Blue (Bill Hunter), a pilot familiar with the outback. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi

Jim Marshall (1936-2010) is reputed as one of the most celebrated and prolific photographers of the twentieth century. During the extraordinary rise of popular culture and counterculture in the 1960s, Marshall seemed to be everywhere that mattered. His images of Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Otis Redding, Brian Jones and Johnny Cash, among many more, are woven into the lore of the era. Because of his dedication to his subjects and loyalty, he was granted second-to-none access. Jim Marshall and Leica Camera are synonymous. Jim used his beloved Leica cameras up until his death in 2010. The exhibit includes photographs from the book “Jim Marshall: Jazz Festival” published by Reel Art Press, and will feature historic artifacts from his life.
Alain Laboile’s exhibition features an artist talk and an Akademie workshop that will entail the spontaneity, creativity and complicity in photography by using and optimizing the surrounding environment in visual storytelling. This self-taught photographer who only possesses one picture of his own childhood simply wished to record the passing of time with his family. Much of the inspiration behind Laboile’s collections stem from his desire to transform the transient moments of his children’s’ lives into everlasting memories that can be viewed years later.

Hi John, just ran across this blog and just wanted to let you know that you and all the kids are are high on my prayer and thought list. See u when you get home.
The latest chapter in the history of the Midland School District’s serial firing of high school boys’ basketball coaches has been nicely and concisely put into historical perspective by Bill Sondag, publisher of the Lacon Home Journal.
Sondag, whose family-owned weekly paper has been closely following local sports and other news for decades, reported on the recent firing of third-year coach Jeff Herkelman in the context of the district’s nearly two-decade pattern of disposing of the people who have held that position.
Recently fired Midland basketball coach met with students who stayed out of class Wednesday to protest his dismissal. Photo provided by Midland parent Bethany Kapechuk of Lacon.
“So Jeff Herkelman will go down as the fifth head basketball coach in the 19-year history of Midland High School (since a consolidation formed the district),” Sondag observed in his story in the April 10 edition. The paper also is circulated in some parts of Marshall County in a different format and under a Toluca Star Herald banner.
“Of the five head coaches at Midland, four of them were eventually fired,” and the other narrowly escaped that, Sondag noted.
The paper is not available online, though a scanned version of Sondag’s article is available below, with some summary comments to follow.
Sondag’s insights into this history are especially useful in light of the district’s formal response to a demonstration in which some 90 high school students stayed out of class April 9 in an outdoor “sit-in” to protest Herkelman’s dismissal. When Superintendent Rolf Sivertsen was asked whether students would face disciplinary action, he e-mailed a brief statement from Jenelle Colvin as “board president/spokesperson.”
The statement ignored the discipline question, focused on defending the district’s refusal to explain why Herkelman had been fired, and blamed someone else unspecified for “much misinformation distributed throughout the community” on an issue that the district refused to discuss at all.
“This incident does not involve athletics or district funding,” Colvin said, in a statement that conspicuously omitted any explanation of what it did involve.
“Does not involve athletics?” Sondag’s historical documentation might lead a person to wonder what’s going on to prompt that kind of denial.
Midland was formed through the consolidation of districts in Sparland and Mid-County, which consisted of the Lacon and Varna areas. The first basketball coach was Ralph Hallam, who had compiled a record of 367-141 at Mid-County, Sondag pointed out in an interview tapping his memory and research materials.
Three years into Midland territory, Hallam was fired, though he remained a teacher until 2004. He was later inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches’ Hall of Fame, and died just over three years ago.
“He was followed by Chris Gibson, who spent four years at Midland, compiling a 55-55 record,” Sondag reported. “He was the only coach not to be fired.”
Some distinction, and a hard-earned one at that, Sondag said in the interview. After surviving “a lot of controversy” and a close board vote on whether to fire him, Gibson resigned and moved on, Sondag said.
The next in line, Justin Cox, was dumped after two years. Like Herkelman, he was a non-tenured teacher who got the treatment that teachers call being “NTR’ed,” or given a notice that the board had chosen not to re-employ him.
And then came Joe Mintus, who led Midland to a 103-87 record over seven years before being fired in a heavily debated episode in 2011. He remains a tenured elementary teacher, and has since separately become head coach at Illinois Valley Central High School in Chillicothe.
Mintus’ later career moves are emblematic of what has happened with other coaches fired by Midland, Sondag suggested. Gibson now coaches in Dwight, and Cox at Tri-Point High School in Livingston County.
“With the exception of Hallam, obviously, all of these guys have gone on to other jobs” after being fired by Midland, he said.
Does that mean there’s a bright future for Herkelman? He didn’t sound too optimistic when he addressed the school board after learning that he would be fired on his 53rd birthday.
On March 6, superintendent Sivertsen had told him that “he was impressed with what I was doing, and everything looked good for the next year,” Herkelman said.
On April 4, just moments before notices were sent out to inform news media that Herkelman would probably be fired at a special meeting three days later, the coach himself got the news. Sivertsen’s only explanation was that, “Life’s tough,” Herkelman said.
“No reason, sorry,” Sivertsen told Herkelman’s wife, Lisa, when she confronted him after the meeting.
“There will be no further comment on this matter,” Sivertsen told the Journal Star in an e-mail on April 9.
So what happened during that month that “does not involve athletics” in a district with a history of firing its coaches? That’s one of the questions that Midland officials have pointedly chosen to leave unanswered.
Gary L. Smith is a free-lance writer who has contributed regularly to the Journal Star since 1993. He reports primarily on events in Marshall, Putnam, and Stark Counties, and the name of this blog is derived from the way that judges in the Peoria-based 10th Judicial District refer to that area.

Is this a decision based on something that could of endangered our students somehow? If so, I think parents need to know.
Is this a decision to cut the man before reaching tenure to save a few bucks? If so, I think taxpayers need to know.
Should he not of been hired after being fired from his previously position? If so, please explain why you chose to hire him despite what may (or may not be) be a questionable record.
Seems to me, that most of the problems I read about are accompanied by Sivertsen’s name. Is the problem everything else or is it Siversten? Can this reporter include a brief story or synopsis on him?
I would like to add, that if I was a parent of a current or future athlete I would be extremely concerned. I certainly wouldn’t want to accept a position as a coach with Midland. That is the worst track record of all.

There was a time when Gold was revered as the epitome of tradition. Shining, pretty and absolutely awesome, this yellow metal had it all until other options arrived. Don’t get us wrong, we are not against gold. After all, it’s a precious metal and looks pretty.
White Gold Engagement Rings are the next stage of evolution. Made of platinum, these rings look stylish and sophisticated, of course conveying the sentiment of love through their exclusive design. In terms of malleability and ductility, white gold possesses a nature similar to the real gold. However, in terms of beauty, it is truly for those who have an elevated taste.
The plain band: Nothing is more beautiful than the simple band like design. Yes! The concept of wedding bands has existed since eternity and there is no denying that it continues to be very enchanting even today.
The complementing design: There was a time when wedding bands had to be identical. In fact, originally, wedding bands never had to be in pairs. Having one was enough because tradition claimed that the guy had to give the wedding ring to the girl. The girl need not reciprocate the favor with equal velour. Now since the tradition has evolved keeping it a couple mix, a new and interesting idea would be to go for different wedding rings. We mean, why not choose complementing designs.
Blend it with diamonds: White gold shines and when you choose an exquisite design with diamonds in it, the beauty simply amplifies. Yes! Diamond studded designs in white gold are trending and if you are fond of some jazz, this could be a great choice.
Choosing a white gold engagement ring is not tough. There are experts who will do the metal identification and authentication for you. But if you want to understand more detail, it is advisable to do a little research proactively. When you choose white gold rings, they have to shine but in addition to the shine, you have to ensure that you are buying quality stuff. So, ensure that you buy a ring with the required certification.
A Computer screen is usually very sensitive to treat once something goes wrong. It consists of very delicate parts and complex. But if the damage is not so severe then treatment at home is possible. But some risks are still present e.g. exposure to shocks in a computer screen repair. But tips are important i.e having a warranty. Other aspects one can check the monitor lights on the edge of the screen. Flashing light to check the back light of screen is also a way to diagnose what you want to repair. Sometimes complications demand repairing of pixels only that may be stuck. Mostly people run into such complications that can only b corrected in a computer repair shop. This is due to certain professional techniques that only a practitioner on ground can check. This may include testing PC or Mac. Everything starts with diagnosis and testing. This may be important for both hardware and softwares. There may be other problems to identify like malwares, freeze-ups and blue screens etc. the benefit of shops is that they can repair almost any brand .once your computer is down on repairing data recovery is a big challenge. Only an expert can help with that.
It is not just that an expert would correct the softwares or malwares. But the aspects are a lot on computer repairs to work over. These may include certainly home services as well when it comes to installations. Set-up may be having in home setups. Protection of your machine and functions that support your system make a part of whole study. Any thing missing within the list then asks for repair which also counts on a very knowledgeable agent. This is where a customer knows the importance of a computer doctor. Related Experts and technicians must be having an experience of years. The stakeholders of such tag offer especially for free anti-virus check, free anti-spywares and firewalls check. Such brands not only beat every adds cost but are also availble whole week. For such doctors there are certain specializations to offer to clients. Virus removal is the most engaging activity .Upgrades, repairs and router setups are also required to enhance a computer’s performance. Other than that cable, internet and DSL installing also require a computer learned. Such companies which work as such administrative forms usually work in small networks. This allows them to expand the services and give best results. At home if problems after diagnosis do not appear severe then we can put some efforts to have a fix computer. Small tips like determining when your computer turns hot so to have a rest can add to its life. Now many systems are having built-in diagnostics. If you have a proper knowledge then utilize this facility regularly. Metal chassis are a sensitive part and it gets very important to check there temperature quite often. Device drivers may need on and off inspections as well. The most important tip for a good functioning of computer is the when you install something new; do not forget to restore it.
What foods do you reach for when you’re hungry? Do you go for a pint of ice cream or a bag of chips? In what ways do you subconsciously eat? Automatic eating patterns may include eating when; watching television, driving and working. Begin to notice when you “automatically” eat. Many people complain that weight loss diets are too harsh and they don’t even work. I think they fail to take into consideration the smaller portions they eat subconscious throughout the day. Pro tip: Don’t buy snacks you won’t resist. Sweets, chocolates, and cookies are my guilty pleasures.
Practicing yoga is one of the most realistic fitness goals you could set. Yoga nourishes our mental and spiritual states while exercising. Yoga is often associated with getting flexible and relaxing. Few people believe it’s great for getting in shape. Besides from cardiovascular benefits, yoga is an adequate exercise for your muscles. Vinyasa and Bikram yoga is even better choices for those targeting weight loss. Practicing more often and having extended sessions is required.
Car owners take their cars to be serviced each month. How many of us take such good care of our bodies? While cars and planes get routine checkups, it’s sad we never do the same for our bodies unless we’re sick. During checkups, doctors determine what tests to perform based on our health conditions. Cardiovascular fitness should be complemented with regular visits to the doctor. Our lungs, heart, and muscles work together in more ways than we think.
Protein-rich foods aren’t for bodybuilders only. Proteins help in losing those extra pounds by keeping you fuller for longer. While nuts and beans are good protein sources, fish, eggs, and meat contain amino acids essential to fitness. Know your limits. The same proteins that help losing weight may make you fat.
It is hard resisting chocolates. Especially dark-chocolate chips. Let’s be real, controlling cravings for unhealthy foods is the hardest part of dieting. How do we avoid craving for sugar-rich processed junk? Surprisingly, we often confuse thirst for food cravings. When desiring specific food, drink water. If it goes away, you were just thirty. Plus drinking a lot of water reduces appetite. It, therefore, aids in weight loss. Plan meals. By knowing your next meal, you eliminate uncertainty.
Why should you stay hydrated? Your mind is mostly water. Drinking water increases mental alertness. Your psychological state is heightened, and you can concentrate. Plus, your energy levels get a boost too. More water leads to frequent urination and sweating. This flushes out toxins while reducing risks of forming kidney stones and getting urinary tract infections. Looking for an anti-aging solution? Water is your best friend. A moisturized skin is softer, smoother, glows more and less likely to develop wrinkles.

According to figures released by the 2012 National Student Survey our students have an overall satis (...)
In his seventh, and final, State of the Union address this January, President Obama, clearly looking to bolster his legacy as the president who vanquished the Great Recession, boldly asserted that “Anyone claiming that America’s economy is in decline is peddling fiction.” Unfortunately for the President, more and more Americans seem to believe (with an adequate basis in proof) that the fiction is emanating from the White House.
It’s hard to imagine how anyone can really assert with a straight face that the economy is currently “strong.” The most recent Gross Domestic Product (GDP), from 4th Quarter 2015, shows us barely inching along at a 1% annualized growth rate (Bureau of Economic Analysis, 2/26/16). Given that moderate growth used to be measured in the 3%-4% range, and that recent declines in the trade balance could further subtract from both 4th (2015) and 1st quarter GDP, we could be forgiven for raising an eyebrow or two in reaction to Obama’s boast.
For the President and his boosters, last week’s February non-farm payroll report, which showed 242,000 new jobs created and an unemployment rate below the crucial 5% level (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 3/4/16), provided proof that the Administration's economic policies, whatever they may actually be, are working. By beating the 190,000 consensus forecast for February of economists surveyed by Reuters, and revising upward the low 151,000 jobs previously reported in January to 172,000 (BLS, 3/4/16), the government was able to point to two months that averaged north of 200,000 new jobs.
The good news prompted Obama to invite reporters into a Cabinet meeting to crow about the results and to shame those who somehow remain skeptical, saying (to paraphrase) “America’s businesses are creating jobs at the fastest pace since the 1990s…and I don’t expect…this evidence to convince some…to change their doomsday rhetoric.”(The White House, Office of the Press Secretary, 3/4/16) He’s right on that point, the gloom should remain. Yes, the economy is creating jobs, but they are not the kind that can bring us back to the days of solid growth. The more important fact, which Obama did not mention, was that the report showed one of the largest drops in weekly earnings ever reported. It’s too bad that our media seems to be incapable of noticing such a tremendous problem right below the surface.
One month ago, the January jobs report was enlivened by a healthy .5% jump in average hourly earnings. At the time, I argued that such good news would be a one-time event as it resulted from the increases in minimum wages that kicked in at the start of the year in many states across the country. As predicted, the momentum was fleeting. In February, average hourly earnings did not increase the .2% that was expected, but fell .1%. The drop may not seem like much, but it is the first decline since December 2014, and one of only six declines in the past ten years, according to BLS data. Making matters worse, average hours worked declined from 34.6 hours to 34.4. Combining falling wages and falling hours translated into a .7% decline in weekly earnings, the biggest drop ever measured in that statistic. (BLS, 3/4/16) For some reason Obama let that one slide.
The truth is that the big numbers in job creation do not reflect healthy economic growth but a fundamental shift in the labor force away from high-paying, full-time jobs to low-paying, part-time jobs. The February “household” survey of job creation shows that 78% of the jobs created were part-time, and 82% of those were in the low-paying service industries such as food service and retail. This partially explains February’s data that shows exports at the lowest level in almost five years. It’s hard to export the things created by bartenders and waiters. Meanwhile, we lost much higher-paying full time jobs in manufacturing, mining, and logging that would have produced things capable of being exported. Yes jobs are being created, but only at the expense of higher-paying jobs that are being destroyed. (BLS, 3/4/16)
Most observers assumed that the February Challenger Job Cut Report (released the day before non-farm payrolls) would be a big improvement over the very large 75,000 layoff figure posted in January. And while the 61,000 layoffs announced in February was an improvement, it was not nearly as much as observers had hoped. Averaging the two months puts the current pace for announced layoffs at 32% higher than the same period last year. Also, last week, the PMI Service Index, which came in at 53.2 in January, came in at 49.7 in February, showing actual contraction (below 50), (joining the smaller manufacturing sector, which has been contracting for months).
Companies have been incentivized to cut their full-time work force by a variety of costly and burdensome regulations that are largely the result of the Obama Administration. If a company replaces a full-time worker with two part-time workers, the statistics count that as a job gain. But this only holds up if you count quantity while ignoring quality. The view from the street looks quite different, as workers prefer one good job to several bad ones. This is why rallies for Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are so well-attended. The underemployed are fed up with platitudes from the elites and they flock to these outsider candidates, who seem to understand their pain.
It appears that investors are no longer signing up for the optimism either. Normally, a much stronger than expected non-farm payroll report would have ignited a market rally, but this one ignited a rally in gold, which at one point neared a high of $1,280 per ounce (gold was up 3% for the week). The strong jobs report should have convinced investors that the Fed would raise rates, which would hurt gold. But that didn’t happen. The markets have started to figure out that the jobs numbers are meaningless and that soon they will roll over to mirror all the bad data emanating from other sources.
I don’t expect that the President will ever officially acknowledge that the economy has weakened, let alone relapsed into recession. He has walked out too far on his rhetorical branch to walk it back. As a lame duck, he really has no incentive to do so. Such admissions would also undercut the campaign of Hillary Clinton,who is running as the logical successor to carry his torch.
But Janet Yellen is in a very difficult spot. If she continues to ignore the growing signs of recession, she runs the risk of letting one develop prior to the election. This would favor the Republican challenger, whether that is Donald Trump or Ted Cruz, neither of whom would be inclined to reappoint her as Fed Chairwoman, if elected. Allowing the Greenspan bubble to bust on Bush’s watch sealed John McCain’s fate, allowing Obama to ride a wave of voter outrage into the White House in 2008. Yellen does not want Trump to catch a similar wave in 2016.
As a result, I expect the Fed to soften its rhetoric in the very near future. They will promise that the punch bowl is going to remain on the table for the foreseeable future. This means that market movements that have defined 2016 thus far may accelerate in the months ahead, and may provide relief for investors in commodities and foreign currencies who have had the patience to wait out the nonsense.

Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP, Southeast Asia’s largest law firm, reckons the region’s rising bond defaults will inflict as much pain on creditors as the financial crises of 2008 and 1998.
As distress spreads from shipping to mining and retail to construction industries, the law firm said in an interview that recovery rates will be similar to those seen in the global credit meltdown and Asian financial crisis. Secured creditors recover only less than 33 cents on the dollar from insolvencies in East and South Asia, compared with more than 80 cents in the U.S., according to World Bank studies. Rival law firm Hogan Lovells US LLP said in an interview that regional banks will likely boost sales of bad loans in coming months.
“The trough in the mining cycle seems to be continuing and some say it will be a while more before any significant recovery is expected,” said Sim Kwan Kiat, Rajah & Tann’s head of restructuring and insolvency based in Singapore. “From experience, the lower end of the spectrum for recovery rates this time round in 2016 is unlikely to be much different from those in 2008 or 1997-98.”
Bad loans in Singapore rose to a six-year high in 2015. Rating firms last month placed energy and mining companies globally on review for downgrades, the Baltic index of shipping rates last week reached the lowest since its 1985 inception and Singapore home sales had the worst start to a year since 2009, after prices slumped nine quarters in the worst streak in 17 years.
Energy firms dominated 112 global bond defaults last year, according to Standard & Poor’s, as the slowest Chinese growth in two decades helped drive prices for commodities from oil to iron ore and coal to multi-year lows. In Southeast Asia, Indonesia’s PT Berau Coal Energy and PT Trikomsel Oke and Thailand’s Sahaviriya Steel Industries Pcl have missed bond and loan repayments. Sembcorp Marine Ltd., the world’s second-largest oil-rig builder, had its first quarterly loss in at least 12 years as clients canceled orders.
Berau Coal flagged the depth of distress in regional credit markets when it bought back $150 million of bonds at 30.3 cents in December. That’s the lowest since China’s Asia Aluminum Holdings Ltd. repurchased notes at 22.5 cents before it collapsed in March 2009. The price of distressed buybacks in Asia since 2008 averaged 48 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg data show.
Offshore investors have challenged PT Bakrie Telecom’s restructuring in U.S. courts, saying their principal would be trimmed to between 7 and 19 cents on the dollar under the Indonesian firm’s local proposal. In 2009, bondholders recovered under 7 cents on the dollar from the failure of Singapore-listed Celestial Nutrifoods Ltd. and Asia Aluminum Holdings, according to estimates by Greenwich, Connecticut-based Gramercy Funds Management LLC.
Rajah & Tann has seen as much as a 30 percent rise in restructuring and insolvency work over the past two years, Sim said. His firm was involved in cases related to marine fuel supplier OW Bunker A/S, New Delhi-based contractor Punj Lloyd Ltd., China Fishery Group Ltd. and Bakrie Telecom. It also worked on the insolvency of Mercator Lines Singapore Ltd.
Sim sees similar trends to the shipping industry emerging throughout the region, following the slump in oil and gas prices, and predicts that construction will continue to see tough times. After a steady stream of restructuring mandates focused on commodities, coal and oil producers, Hogan Lovells is starting to see signs of stress in the retail industry, said Shaun Langhorne, a restructuring partner based in Singapore.
The creditworthiness of Asia’s junk-rated borrowers has weakened as investors sought the highest risk premium in four years to own their debt. The spread over government securities jumped to 904 basis points earlier this month from as low as 596 basis points in May and was last at 863 basis points, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. Ructions in Asia’s credit markets have wiped out more than $11 billion of junk-bond value from the peak in April last year, while Moody’s Investors Service said in January the negative rating trend for Asia’s non-bank corporates can only worsen in 2016.
DBS Group Holdings Ltd., Southeast Asia’s biggest bank, liquidated some bad loans in December, Chief Executive Officer Piyush Gupta said on Monday. Rival lender United Overseas Bank Ltd. last week said delinquencies may come from the oil and gas sector with S$1 billion of loans tied to exploration companies.
“It’s not just the oil and gas, it’s the larger commodity super-cycle that’s obviously coming off,” Gupta said. With regards to bad loans in the offshore marine sector, “we were able to monetize 60 percent of the collateral in the fourth quarter. We took no big write-off, the residual amount of the loans went into nonperforming assets,” he said.
The 376 listed companies in Southeast Asia have accumulated $100 billion of debt tied to the steel, metals, mining and energy sectors based on their latest filings, Bloomberg-compiled data show. While that fell from $108 billion a year earlier, it’s surged from $47 billion in 2009.
Hogan Lovells expects “banks in the region to be scrutinizing their loan book and looking at ways to rationalize,” Langhorne said. “The bundling of nonperforming loans for disposal is likely to be a trend in the coming months.”

San Diego, CA – Davlyn Investments, a prominent California multi-family and commercial property investment firm in a venture with Torrey Pines LLC, recently closed escrow on the purchase of its first industrial property in Southern California. The project, known as Carroll Business Center, is a 44,000 square foot, flex industrial building located in Miramar, a northern San Diego County industrial market. Tim Olson of Jones Lang LaSalle represented both parties with lending provided by Laurie Blake of Mission Federal Credit Union. The property was acquired for $5,695,500 and is currently 100% occupied by Hi-Tech Electronic Manufacturing Corporation.
Davlyn’s Director of Office Acquisitions, John Hale described the appeal of the asset, “The acquisition of Carroll Business Center diversifies Davlyn’s holdings in Southern California across submarkets and asset classes. Although we’re not currently known for industrial investments, that’s about to change. Investments in industrial product will allow us to further diversify our portfolio, and we are eager to pursue more and larger opportunities in this asset class.”
Jon Williams, CEO of the firm, elaborated on Davlyn’s plans, “Carroll Business Center provides our partners strong cash flow from a long-time San Diego tenant. The property’s irreplaceable location in the heart of Miramar insures that it will be a solid competitor in the market if, in the future, space becomes available.” Mr. Williams added,” Although multifamily and commercial office acquisitions will remain our focus, we’re very excited to stay where we know what’s going on and invest in the industrial sector.”
Davlyn Investments, Inc. is a San Diego-based owner/operator of apartment communities and commercial property throughout California. To date, the firm has acquired almost $900,000,000 in real estate assets. The company is headed by Jon Williams and Paul Kerr.

When I decided to add Islamic months to the table of moon timings I did a lot of research into how this worked. What is presented here is my current understanding and may not be entirely correct. Feel free to email me if any of this is madly inaccurate or you disagree in some way.
Islam uses a purely lunar calendar of twelve months. The start of each month is determined by the timing of the New moon. The majority of Muslims seem to wait until the sighting of a thin crescent after the New moon. If the crescent has been seen by just after sunset then the new month starts. If it happens to be cloudy then they simply wait an extra day before starting the new month. Thus no month is ever longer than 30 days. Because the calendar is lunar it moves backwards by about 11 days each solar year.
Since the visibility of the crescent moon depends on a number of factors which are impossible to calculate it is just as impossible to exactly predict when a new month will begin. For civil purposes most Muslim groups and countries either use the ‘normal’ (Gregorian) calendar or a ‘tabular’ Islamic calendar which may differ slightly from the religious calendar.
There are some Muslims groups which argue that it is fine, and indeed correct, to use the predictable astronomical New moon to determine the start of a month and they do just this. For these groups of people the date shown in the New moon column in the moon timings table will indicate the start date of the month provided the time shown is before sunset. If the time is after sunset then the month will start the following day.
There seem to be an almost infinite number of variations on these themes and it has produced much, sometimes heated, debate. Everyone claims their reasoning is backed up by the same verses in the Holy Qu’ran. So far as I can tell no one has actually gone to war over it. Indeed the debate seems to be pretty amicable.
If all this isn’t complicated enough already not everyone agrees on just where in the world the crescent moon has to be seen. Some people use visibility in Makkah, others in Jerusalem, others use local sunset while still others use the sunset in the town or country where their family originated if they happen to have moved. Still others say that the month starts when the crescent moon has been seen anywhere in the world.1
All this can lead to different Muslim communities living in the same place starting their months on different days.
I find all all this very perplexing but as a non-Muslim who has read the relevant bits of the Qu’ran (in English) I’m inclined to agree with the folks who say that Allah (through the Prophet) only suggested using the visible crescent because to do otherwise would have involved too much complication at the time.
The Qu’ran does quite clearly state that the astronomical New moon is entirely predictable but who am I to get involved in the argument? It does rather suggest a reason for just why Islamic countries have produced so many fine mathematicians and astronomers.
The moon timings in the table are astronomical New and Full moons. The Islamic months are shown next to the New moon on which the start of the month will be based. Also shown in the Islamic month column is an estimated start date for the month. As explained above this can (for most Muslims anyway) only be an estimate but it should be no more than one day out.
1 A further complication is the attitude of the Saudi authorities. They seem obsessed with being the first to observe the crescent moon especially at the beginning and end of Ramadan. The obsession goes so far in some years that they claim the moon has been seen when it is clearly impossible to see it. Indeed, they’ve even claimed to have seen it several hours before astronomical new moon. [29th January 2004].
The frequently asked questions at MoonSighting.com include the information that the youngest moon ever seen with the naked eye was 15.4 hours old. This happened on 14 September 1871. The Saudis regularly ‘see’ moons which are younger than this. A few days after I’m writing this they’re going to do it again. The moon marking the start of Ramadan 1425 will be a little over 12 hours old at sunset in Makkah yet I’ve no doubt that the Saudis will claim to have seen it yet again. [11th October 2004]
Note that although the month actually starts at sunset (Islam starts days at sunset) the date given is the day starting at the midnight following that sunset.
There are more involved systems available for estimating crescent visibility but they’re beyond my capabilities to handle at the current time.

He could see the tall, peeling yellow building at the periphery of his range of vision. But something about it struck him as strange. A shimmer, an unsteadiness, as if the building faded forward into stability and then retreated into insubstantial uncertainty. An oscillation, each phase lasting a few seconds and then blurring off into its opposite, a fairly regular variability as if an organic pulsation underlay the structure. As if, he thought, it’s alive.
The Fourth International Conference on Transdisciplinary Imaging at the Intersections of Art, Science and Culture 2016 – THE ATEMPORAL IMAGE – is being hosted by i-DAT at Plymouth University in the Roland Levinsky Building located in the heart of Plymouth City. The conference will access a broad range of imaging technologies located on the Plymouth campus, including the Immersive Vision Theatre, the Wolfson Nanomagnetics Laboratory and the Electron Microsopy Centre.
Following a vibrant and successful conference, presenters are invited to submit Full Papers for inclusion in Ubiquity: The Journal of Pervasive Media, published by Intellect Ltd. [free issue here]. Full paper deadline: 10 August 2016 (revised date). Details here: http://transimage.i-dat.org/publication/
The Stage 1 Abstract Submissions Deadline is the 29 January 2016 NEW DATE: 21 February 2016 (see Author Guidelines)

The Fourth International Conference on Transdisciplinary Imaging at the Intersections of Art, Science and Culture 2016 – THE ATEMPORAL IMAGE – invites participants for the Conference workshops hosted by the Plymouth Electron Microscopy Centre and the Immersive Vision Theatre on the Plymouth Campus.
A limited number of places, on a fist come basis, are available and participants must be registered with the Transimage Conference first.
The Atemporal Image Transcalar workshops couple the power of the Scanning Electron Microscope to touch the infinitesimally small with the potential of the Full Dome environment to immerse participants in visualisations of the incomprehensibly big.
Our ability to shift scales, from the smallest thing to the largest thing has been described as the ‘transcalar imaginary’ http://www.scoop.it/t/transcalar-imaginary. These workshop will enable participants to touch the frozen non-photonic spaces and immerse themselves in data visualisations and sonifications.
The Fourth International Conference on Transdisciplinary Imaging adopts the theme of the ATEMPORAL IMAGE and calls for papers that explore how a new temporality informs and plays out across contemporary visual culture. Participants are asked to address aspects of the atemporal at least one of the following areas:
the still image | the immersive image | the sound as image | hypermediacy and the iconic character of the image | politics of the image and/or image making in a transdisciplinary context| life sciences and bioart in relation to the living image| distributed and networked image | The trans-scalar image(inary), from the nano to the astronomical image | Artificial and computer vision | moving still | image as time, real-time and glitch-time| archival, permanency and immediacy| aesthetics and proliferation of the image
The conference invites papers that respond to the above provocation in areas related to: Media Arts, Painting, Drawing, Curating, Installation, Film, Video, Photography, Computer/data Visualization/sonification, Real-time Imaging, Intelligent Systems and Image Science.
The World Bank is developing a global standard for measuring countries’ inclusion of LGBTI individuals.
By the early 1990s, Dr. Mary Ellsberg had spent years working with women’s health in Nicaragua. Armed with anecdotes of violence against women, she joined a local women’s organization to advance a bill criminalizing domestic violence.
When presented with the bill, lawmakers “pretty much laughed in our faces,” she explained in a 2015 TEDx talk. “They said no one would pay attention to this issue unless we got some ‘hard numbers’ to show that domestic violence was a problem.”
Dr. Ellsberg went back to school and wrote her doctoral dissertation on violence against women. Her study showed that 52% of Nicaraguan women had experienced physical or sexual abuse by an intimate partner. Subsequently, the Nicaraguan parliament unanimously passed the domestic violence bill.
Later, the World Health Organization used Dr. Ellsberg’s indicators to measure violence against women in countries across the world, which showed the global magnitude of the problem.
“One out of three women will experience physical or sexual abuse by her partner,” Dr. Ellsberg said. Because of the data, “violence against women is at the very top of the human rights agenda.”
Dr. Ellsberg knew that domestic violence was a problem, but it was data that prompted leaders to combat the issue.
Similarly, there are plenty of documented cases of discrimination and abuse against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) people. But what’s the magnitude of the discrimination?

I was in Charleston this past weekend for a birthday party for my wife’s one year-old grandson. She is from Nitro, and my dad’s family is (was) mostly from the Huntington and Louisa, KY areas. While the festivities were going on I was able to find a quite spot and read your paper.
When I was a kid (about 4), we moved from Ceredo to Fall River, Massachusetts. My dad worked for General Foods Corp, and had married a Maine Yankee when he was a Navy pilot. After my two sisters were born in Huntington she had had enough of WV and wanted to get back up North. Over the years we would make the trip back to Louisa to visit grandparents,cousins, aunts and uncles in the summer. A very long and tedious trip. Coming off the Pennsylvania Turnpike we would head west and eventually connect with Route 2/7 in Moundsville, and follow the Ohio River on our way to Huntington. He would drive us by the prison to impress on us that it was where the bad guys go. I think there was a glass factory my mom also liked to visit. We would even see chain-gangs on the roads. Your fine story gave me some background on the prison. I was under the impression it had all been torn down.
I worked for The New York Times for 23 years before retiring down here in Prosperity, SC where most of my wife’s family migrated too from WV. It is pleasure to read your paper. Every time I am up your way I get a copy. It is great to see how well a “small” market paper can do with great writing and good design (still has the size of a newspaper). We have an awful paper here in Columbia. The State would be out of business if it didn’t have obits, cooking and USC football to cover. It is really sad, but it is not much better than the local weeklies.
Keep up your fine writing and picture taking. Tell the editor, next time you risk your life and sanity, that you want to be on the front page above the fold.
Continuing October’s Thrills and Chills theme, I’m writing about horror movies and beer on the blog. Today’s film is the 1972 flick “Asylum.”
I had high hopes for this one. A lot of the cooler, quirkier horror films came out of the late 1960s and early 1970s –and I have always been a Peter Cushing fan (Most people remember him as the guy who was Darth Vader’s boss in “Star Wars” or as the guy who did those meh “Dr. Who” films).
The description on Amazon listed him as a star and sold the film as one of the best horror anthologies.
At best, “Asylum” is a bland, uninspired mess with thinly drawn characters, a dull plot and special effects on par with the aforementioned “Dr. Who” television show of the time. The brightest moment in the whole thing concerned a batch of idiotic looking robot toys that sort of become grotesque by the end –but it really feels like the film missed out by just being cheap.
If the producers should have doubled the film’s budget to at least $20 they might have had something, but they must have sunk all their money in fabulous location shooting or a good booze for the writers or something.
Likewise, Peter Cushing is only barely in the movie. He shows up twice in one of the vignettes, but little depth is given to the motivation of his character.
I bought this one entirely for the witchy-like lady on the cover –and had hoped to spend this beer on something good, but alas, no…
I liked the beer. It had nice chocolatey/coffee notes and a light chewy mouth-feel. I like a good porter and this one was pretty decent –but not as good as my beloved Big Timber porter.
Got a movie? Got Beer? Think the two would go together. Let me know. Drop me a line at lynch@wvgazettemail.com –or just post here.
Continuing our monthly exploration of what beers go with which horror films, I picked out an old one, 2008’s Swedish vampire film, “Let the Right One In,” and one of my go to beers when I can’t find anything better to drink, Magic Hat #9.
“Let the Right One In” is about the difficulty of finding a true friend and navigating the world when you’re an outsider. In some ways, “Let the Right One In” is like a lot of other teen dramas, except periodically someone is brutally murdered and drained of their blood.
The story revolved around Eli and Oskar, a couple of 12 year-olds living in the armpit of the Sweden (which isn’t really all that bad, just kind of run down). Oskar is a meek and awkward kid who is being continuously bullied by a group of his classmates. At night, he spends his time fantasizing about stabbing his tormentors and collecting newspaper clippings of brutal murders.
Eli is a centuries old vampire shacked up with an old guy named Hakan who acts as a kind of caretaker and henchman.
If this were “Dracula,” Hakan would be Renfield, a thrall, but Eli and Hakan’s relationship is not so cut and dried. He loves Eli, but it’s a weird kind of devotion that is difficult to define –not exactly the love of a parent for a child, a child for a parent or a husband for a wife, but something of all three.
Eli and Oskar meet. Eli says he can’t be Oskar’s friend and immediately begins manifesting unnatural abilities. Oskar misses the social cues that would warn other people to stay away or maybe invest in a firearm.
The pair learns from each other –Oskar learns to be brave when he has a weapon in hand and can easily overpower his opponent; Eli learns the secrets to the Rubik’s Cube.
Joking aside, I’ve loved this one since I first saw it. It does a pretty good job of capturing the wide-eyed naivete of being 12, while also showing that being a pre-teen vampire is a drag.
Pairing the film with Magic Hat #9 wasn’t exactly inspired, but it was what I had stashed in the back of my fridge. I did have a batch of beer I got from the Wine and Cheese shop at the Capitol Market earlier in the day, but all of that stuff was still warm.
Still, Magic Hat #9 is a pretty good beer –not a great beer, not a life changing beer (which does not exist unless said beer suddenly makes me 10 years younger) –but a pretty good beer. It’s a good beer to have after mowing a lawn or raking leaves. It’s a good beer with a fairly depressing slice of vegan pizza. It’s a good beer to slug down whether you’re binge-watching some weird Canadian sci fi show on Netflix or catching an old film that’s held up pretty well despite the various advancements in vampire movies.
Flavored beers taste like a marketing ploy aimed at rich sorority girls and shandys are like the Arnies of the beer world (An Arnie is a half lemonade and half iced tea. Recently passed golfing legend Arnold Palmer drank them so often, people started calling the drink by his name.
Still, I wasn’t paying for Lienenkugal’s Harvest Patch Shandy and it seemed like a good start to this month’s “One Month at a Time” side project: pairing beers with horror films.
IMDb describes it as “A family in 1630s New England is torn apart by the forces of witchcraft, black magic and possession.”
The set up is a Puritan family leaves town after they have falling out with the local church authorities over some interpretation of the New Testament.
I missed what they were arguing over, but given the time period, it could have been over punctuation.
The family moves out on their own, where they establish a poor farm, struggle to feed themselves and somehow attract the attention of the local witch who then tirelessly works to destroy them.
On its face, “The Witch” is like a lot of similar films set during the Salem Witch Trials era. Christians in the new world are under siege by what they perceive to be diabolical forces. In many of these films, the villain turns out to be the Christians themselves, who are just thick-headed jerks or whatever.
The devil is very much at work on this small family and there’s no real explanation for why, other than “just ’cause.” There is no logical reason why Satan is interested in this particular family and nearly as disturbing there’s no help on the way. God is in his heaven and can’t be bothered to lift a finger to help a (possibly) slightly misguided but devout farmer, his wife and their five innocent children. No heroic, young preacher stops in to save them with a glowing cross or just the right prayer. Angels don’t turn up wielding a flaming sword.
In some ways, “The Witch” reminded me of something like “Jaws,” where the people are warned not to leave the safety of the beach because there’s this giant shark trolling out there in the ocean somewhere, which will eat them if it gets the chance. Everybody shrugs it off, of course. They know better, go for a swim and, predictably, are eaten.
As I mentioned at the beginning, I’m not a huge fan of flavored beers –and this one is no exception. It has a rich, pumpkin flavor, which would be perfect if it was Thanksgiving and you just didn’t feel like dunking your pumpkin pie into a frosty mug of Coors Light while watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.
I don’t know. Maybe this is for the all girls in yoga pants to sip on when they get bored of their gas station grade Pumpkin Spice Latte.
I liked “The Witch,” and the Lienenkugal’s Harvest Patch Sandy technically paired well with the movie. Both were thought-provoking and had an unexpected flavor, but, were each, in their own way, kind of depressing.
Popular children's cereal Honey Smacks has been linked to a massive salmonella outbreak that has infected 100 people. "The FDA has learned that some retailers are still selling this product". The CDC said illnesses after June 19 may not have been reported yet because it takes an average of two to four weeks between the time a person becomes ill and when their illness is reported.
While the recall covers those boxes of Honey Smacks with a best-by date of June 14, 2018, through June 14, 2019, the FDA is recommending consumers avoid the cereal altogether, because products with earlier dates could also potentially be contaminated.
In addition, the agency has advised the public to report any sales of the cereal to the FDA Consumer Complaint Coordinator in their area.
At the time, there were a number of salmonella cases in New England, including five in MA and one in New Hampshire.
The French teenager has been handed the number 29 shirt following his switch to Arsenal in the summer transfer window. Lucas Torreira , Bernd Leno , Sokratis, Matteo Guendouzi and Stephan Lichtsteiner have all arrived at Arsenal .
Not only will James produce with SpringHill, but he is also apparently in talks to be cast in a starring role. Either way, it seems clear that James' decision to join that Lakers has been received with mixed feelings.
And in my role I've got the eyes into Euro 2020 so it's not the right moment to make an assessment just yet". Goal scorer Umtiti said the win had come on the back of the work of the entire team.
Although Kellogg's recalled the cereals on June 14, the FDA reports that recalled packages of Honey Smacks cereal are still being offered for sale.
Samples of the facility's environment and the product collected during the FDA's inspection match the outbreak strain of salmonella mbandaka, the agency said.
The cases have been reported in 33 states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, California, Maryland and Virginia. The first cases were reported in March and the most recent ones on July 2. No deaths have been reported in the latest outbreak.
Their striker plays 30 metres from his own goal. " France heads a corner and does nothing more than defend", Courtois said. And Hazard added: "I prefer to lose with this Belgium than win with that France ".
Gowdy said, pointing out the pro-Hillary bias among other members of the investigative team who weren't booted from it. The talk show host let highlights of the Capitol Hill testimony provide the jokes for him.
Jonathan Crenshaw, 46, used his feet to hold scissors and stabbed Cesar Coronado, 22, Miami Beach police said Wednesday. A man vacationing in South Beach was stabbed just after midnight Tuesday by a man with no arms.
The boys, who are still in the hospital, are undoubtedly adjusting and dealing with extreme trauma from the incident. But miraculously, after nine days of searching, divers discovered the missing soccer team alive .
They also watched a Democratic campaign committee employee access the organization's bank account information. Rick Gates , another Trump campaign aide, pleaded guilty to lying to investigators and one conspiracy charge.
As captain of the Portuguese team in the 2018 World Cup, he scored four goals, including a hat-trick against Spain. Its members will walk out at 22:00 local time on Sunday and remain on strike until 18:00 on the following Tuesday.
Sensibly, Southgate says he will wait to see how well his players recover from another gruelling contest before picking a side. Thousands of fans gathered at major outdoor screenings for the knockout games as World Cup fever gripped the nation.
At NATO, Trump did not specify which countries had committed to what, and it remained unclear whether any had changed their plans. Around eight members of the 29-country alliance are expected to reach the 2% target this year.
Page was subpoenaed to provide a deposition behind closed doors on Wednesday, but she didn't appear under Jeffress's advice. Strzok and Page were both members of the special counsel Robert Mueller had appointed to run the Russian investigation.
He suited up in 17 games for the Lakers before hip surgery ended a season in which he shot just 37.3 percent from the field. Maybe these posts had an effect as it was reported soon after that he had signed a one-year deal with the Denver Nuggets .
He also clashed with senior players such as Diego Costa and David Luiz while others had begun to grow tired of his methods. Chelsea manager Antonio Conte , pictured with the FA Cup trophy in May, has been sacked after two years in charge.
The caretaker government in Punjab has intensified the crackdown against PML-N ahead of the Sharifs' homecoming rally. I am aware that I have been sentenced to 10 years [in prison] and I will be taken to a jail cell straight away.
In response to the indictment , Democrats overwhelmingly called for Trump not to meet with Putin. Engel of NY and Ted Lieu of California, joined House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith , Rep.
New Zealander Dion Smith led a five-man breakaway at the start of the hilly 181 kilometre stage, which started in Brest. Title hopefuls Tom Dumoulin (Sunweb) and Romain Bardet ( AG2R La Mondiale) were the big losers of the day.
We can't make a story after each mistake, let's carry on and make the best of the situation and learn from it. I would say the mistake of the two boys, but we don't talk about it.
In their illustrious careers, they have played some hard-fought battles. "It is always a big challenge to face Novak". Djokovic took the first set 6-3 and was on course to avenge his defeat he suffered the previous year.
The source with knowledge of the talks told CNN that Trump asked whether Kim knew where he'd gotten the nickname, and Kim said no. However, while the North's attitude may further impede the denuclearization talks, the regime is unlikely to boycott them.
Angry Birds and other apps cost 99 cents or more just to download. "None of this would have been possible without the App Store ". Better with Moment cases: The only app specifically created to work with the Moment Battery Photo Case and Original Photo Case.

Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company, demonstrated the extraordinary Short Take-Off and Landing (STOL) capabilities of the M28 Turboprop Airplane to interested Military, Civil and Commercial Operators in Rio de Janeiro during the LAAD Defence & Security trade show held from April 4th to 7th.
The aircraft arrived on April 3rd at Jacarepaguá Airport, Rio de Janeiro, having demonstrated a range of mission capabilities to operators in Trinidad and Tobago, and to the Brazilian Army and other transport operators in Manaus and Brasília. Demonstrated flight capability included take-off with up to 2,300 kgs (5,000 lbs.) of cargo in just 548 meters (1,800 ft.) of runway length, and fast reconfiguration of the 13,73 m3 (485 cu ft.) cabin from passenger to cargo, or a combination of both.
"We are very pleased by the strong interest shown by commercial transport companies and Military Commands as the M28 Airplane demonstrates the largest payload capacity of its class," said Adam Schierholz, Sikorsky Regional Executive for Latin America. "Operators are looking for a powerful, versatile and low maintenance aircraft that is expressly designed to fly cargo and passengers into unprepared landing strips, and to para-drop relief supplies or troops, whether in mountain regions, jungle clearings or small Island Strips at sea level."
Transport operators in Trinidad & Tobago showed particular interest in the M28 Aircraft's ability to carry 19 passengers or a mix of passengers and cargo on the same flight, and to load and offload cargo via the clamshell doors at the rear of the stand-up cabin. An optional air conditioning system also proved attractive.
The Brazilian Army witnessed how the dual-piloted aircraft can be loaded with mission equipment or up to 17 equipped troops, can perform Medical Evacuations, and can precisely drop paratroops and cargo from the rear of the plane. Mission equipment inserted into the cabin using a manually operated cargo hoist with 700 kgs (1,540 lbs.) loading capacity was shown to give the flight crew independent cargo-handling flexibility in remote locations.
Sikorsky-PZL is a part of Lockheed Martin, a Global Security and Aerospace Company that employs approximately 97,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.

But then the kids found out about the Wild things hotties by Twig&Tale, hot water bottle covers that look like animals. They loved the idea and their imagination ran away with them. Could you also make a jellyfish? Or a frog? Or a horse? Please, mummy, let's make a new animal. Now I have to tell you a secret: I'm not a drawing artist. Or designer. At all. But I do love those kids, so I tried anyway. Tongue out of my mouth and hours of erasing, tearing it up, starting again, and all of a sudden... a horse was born!

We drove our Toyota to Franz Josef, about 2 hours, Mostly on the left-hand side of the street. The car has a big sign on the dashboard with an arrow that says keep left. This is important. For the first 40 or 50 times we tried to turn on the turn signal, we turned on the windshield wipers. The turn signal lever is not on the left side but on the right side of the steering wheel. The windshield wipers are on the left side. So every time you try to make a turn signal you turn on the wipers. My job is to yell " left left keep left" and Gary's...
We had another long driving day, today, turning a 5 hour drive from FJG to Queenstown, via the Haast Pass, into a 10 hour spectacular, despite the rain that persisted for much of the drive. For this update, I'll let the pictures tell the story (when I get around to posting them 𯘏); suffice to say that we stopped in several beautiful spots and went on a couple of short hikes. Perhaps the best of them was to Blue Pools. We also had to make a decision on whether to take the scary Crown Range road, the highest public road in NZ, or the low...
Today was the day for the big SKI trip! The day dawned with clear skies and sunshine, so we were full of anticipation for our helicopter flight later on. After breakfast, we made our scheduled status call to the helicopter company, only to have our anticipation converted to frustration. They were now saying that we were on standby and that we would only be able to go if the other four passengers were within the weight limits for the six-seat Squirrel helicopter; otherwise, these people would be taken on the four-seat Hughes 500 and we would...
The promised rain arrived during the evening and continued into the morning, meaning we were in no hurry to get out; however, we did have a phone call to make to the helicopter company. I ended up speaking to the owner/pilot who confirmed we would be on the flight tomorrow, subject to the forecast good weather eventuating. Good news! The limited indoor options in FJG meant stay in the apartment or chance the rain on another hike. We chose the latter. The Franz Josef Glacier Valley is, below the glacier, essentially in two parts. The lowest...
If you read yesterday’s entries, you will know that we managed to turn a 5 hour drive into a ten hour epic, which is normal for us - we just stop so often and take copious photos! We don’t mind that, of course, but it does mean that we pay the price from time to time. Today, that price was to sleep in and not get to Lake Matheson for the famed early morning stillness and reflections of Mount Cook. After breakfast, we headed down to Fox Glacier and Lake M - about a 40 minute drive - and set off on the Lake Matheson Walk. It should actually...
Part 2... Just after leaving Death’s Corner, the clouds parted and gave way to beautiful blue skies, just in time to reveal numerous snow-capped mountains. We pulled off into a lay-by to take some pictures and have lunch, while enjoying the views we did not expect when we left rainy Christchurch. The rest of the drive down to the coast was just one Kodak moment after another and we made several stops just to admire the scenery. At Kumara Junction, we turned South and made our way to Hokitika. There we made a planned detour to visit the...
Woke to a beautifully fine morning. Blue skies everywhere, so today is our day to do the Heli Hike...That is until we saw the mountain...The blue sky was everywhere, except over the mountain, where we need it to be. The morning tour was cancelled, but everyone was hanging onto hope that the clouds would lift in time for the afternoon tour to go ahead. Another quietish morning before heading out to get a 'Jimmy's' pie for lunch (famous in New Zealand apparently) & see how we are looking for our afternoon tour. Still unsure, as it is very...
What an awful night last night. It started raining about 6.00 & did not stop until after 9.00 this morning. When I say it did not stop raining I mean it did not stop at all...Not like at home where it might rain for an hour then stop for a bit before starting up again. This was ALL though the night. Very difficult to sleep, as the sound is amplified on the campervan... This was not good news as were were again booked to do the Heli Hike today. Rang them & yes it has been cancelled again. Not to worry, as yesterday we found out through the...
Loving the amount of sleep we are able to get in New Zealand. It is dark very early, so the boys are not complaining about going to bed reasonably early. Last night it was 7.45. The mornings are also very dark. It is just starting to get light in the van at 8.30, so we are all enjoying a sleep in aswell... This morning we woke to drizzling rain...Not a good sign as we are due to go on the Heli Hike today. Went down & spoke to them & the Heli Hike has been cancelled (as we expected...) so we rescheduled for tomorrow...Fingers Crossed the...
Woke to a very cold morning. The grass was white from frost, but the sky was nice & clear, hence the cold temperature. Got on the road about 9.30 to make our way to Franz Joseph Glacier. Today is our biggest driving day with us travelling approx 390km. This not like driving at home, were this would take about 4 hours... We stopped briefly at Hokitika. Fay this is where we got the penguins for you last time. They have an amazing glass figurine/bowl/ormanents etc shop here. We had to make a purchase to support the local community, so I...
We caught the TranzAlpine train in the morning and took the 4 hour ride up and over the NZ Southern Alps. As the day was cloudy and rainy, some of the views were obscured-but I still got some pictures. What was amazing to me where all the Lupin along the tracks - the purple and blue against the mountains was beautiful. Once in Greymouth, we picked up our next rental car and drove up the coast to see the Pancake Rocks. Still quite rainy, but we ventured out onto the boardwalk and were rewarded with spectacular views of these pancake looking...

In the Supreme Court hearing on Aadhaar, before a two-judge Bench, in May 2017, the then Attorney General, Mukul Rohatgi, while countering the petitioners’ objections to the government’s move, said that their “arguments on so-called privacy and bodily intrusions are bogus”. He also offered pro-welfare, anti-corruption and anti-terrorist arguments in favour of Aadhaar: “It is an effective tool to check terror financing and black money. It ensures that money meant for poor people reaches them.”
The present Attorney General, K.K. Venugopal, said, before a five-judge Constitution Bench in the final hearings on the Aadhaar project, in March 2018, that there was a need to balance the right of 300 million poor people to live with dignity and without starvation as against the privacy rights of others. But, Justice Chandrachud stated that this argument would go against the spirit of the Supreme Court’s privacy judgement. He clarified: “It is not that privacy is for one section of population and economic right for another.”
In his recent interview carried in India Today (April 9), the Union Minister for Information Technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, offered his arguments in defence of Aadhaar: “There is a lot of misconception about Aadhaar. Its biggest opponents are those who introduced the Right to Information. The poor have no objection... Privacy cannot and should not become the shield of the corrupt and the terrorists.”
We are fortunate that the Supreme Court was not convinced by the argument that the right to privacy is an elitist affair, and that the poor people are not concerned about it. In July 2017, a nine-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court declared the Right to Privacy to be a fundamental right. Not accepting Attorney General Venugopal’s characterisation of the right to privacy as an “elitist” argument, the Bench reportedly told him: “Your argument that the Right to Privacy applies to the elite alone is wrong, it applies to the poor people as well.”
The government’s contention that Aadhaar is an “effective tool” of delivering welfare benefits to people has been contested by activist scholars. To put it in the words of one such scholar, Reetika Khera: “Aadhaar is a direct assault on the ‘right to life’ of many in the sense that pre-existing benefits (rations, pensions etc.) have now become contingent upon Aadhaar. Our research and government data suggest that the number of affected people is in hundreds of thousands... It is bizarre that while Aadhaar in fact harms the poor, it is positioned by the government as a tool that ‘empowers’ them.”
We are seriously concerned about the possibility that Aadhaar information, rather than empowering the poor, maybe used as an additional weapon of social control at the micro and macro levels in our “strange times”.
On 105th birth anniversary of Nikhil Chakravartty on November 3, 2018 - Some Tributes (published after his death)
By the way, to avoid being confusing to you, let me again ask a simple question: What in the heck was the mandate if it wasn't to stop Obama? We've got the exit polling data to prove it now, by the way. Sixty-one percent, stop Obama. There's no question, what else could it have been? The Republicans didn't run on a mandate. Individual Republican races did, but the Republican Party did not have a national brand or national identity. What could this election have meant? It could not have meant anything but stop Obama.
The Republican Party did not run on a mandate , as recognized by Limbaugh, and voters quite clearly dislike Barack Obama. Their only mandate now is to "stop Obama," to oppose anything Obama because it is Obama, which has been their strategy for six year, national interest be damned. Two days before the election, a Washington Post blogger noted that the President was at -10 in his approval/disapproval rating and that individuals most likely to vote were even more negative toward him.
Now, the left can't afford that. Stopping Obama is stopping liberalism. This was deep. This was big. Folks, this was a shellacking I think even broader and wider and deeper than 2010. This is huge what happened on Tuesday. It is major. It's gonna be a long time before the Democrats recover from this, and therefore they can't afford there to be an accepted explanation for this election result that means anything like what they believe in was rejected. They simply cannot let that stand.
Of course, stopping a center-right president is not stopping liberalism. At least Limbaugh gets a little more specific when he continues
The left simply cannot afford for the truth of the meaning of their massive defeat to set in. So their buddies in the media and elsewhere throughout the party are gonna do everything they can to pooh-pooh it and try to call it something else. Minimum wage, you wouldn't believe some of the excuses they're concocting.
Most obvious is the irony that Rush Limbaugh would cite minimum wage, given the overwhelming approval of it on Tuesday. However, that's the genius of Rush The Corporate Man- he never said minimum wage increases were turned down, only "minimum wage, you wouldn't believe some of the excuses they're concocting," thereby implying that voters rejected minimum wage increases. Limbaugh frequently refers to "low information voters," implying he means liberals, but he probably suspects that the term better fits his own listeners, and does his best to exploit their ignorance.
The public's verdict, 4.5 to zero, on lifting the income of Americas's lowest-paid workers was decisive. The minimum wage (map from L.A. Times Graphic) was raised in the left-wing enclaves of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota, with the vote favorable, but non-binding, in Illinois. Voters' progressivism was less pronounced on other issues, with one victory (Montana), one defeat (Connecticut), and one draw on voting rights. In Missouri early voting was rejected, as summarized here by Colin Dailede, because it "came with too many restrictions."
Dailede notes a gun control measure passed in Washington State, while two anti-abortion measures (in Colorado and North Dakota) went down and one (in Tennessee) was approved. The voters' sentiment on marijuana legalization (map from USA Today) was particularly clear, with referenda passing in two states (Alaska and Oregon) and in the District of Columbia. A resounding majority approved legalization also in Florida but fell short of the 60% needed to amend the state's constitution. (We were spared cheap shots on this issue by the talk show host whose drug of choice once was Oxycontin- a gateway drug to heroin, as it were).
Something was happening on Election Day but it wasn't, except tangentially, a rejection of liberalism. Two incumbent Democrats even more conservative than President Obama, Kay Hagan and Mark Pryor, went down to defeat, the latter resoundingly. Prescriptions for rejuvenating the less corporate party vary, though one particularly sensible comes from Will Bunch, who while slapping the Democratic Party for not emphasizing the need to raise the minimum wage, argues
But to win, of course, they'll also need to do more to address the needs of folks above the minimum wage. That means talking more about education -- runaway college tuition, slumping and underfunded public schools (and not just in the cities) and the need for more vocational training that matches actual jobs. (And speaking of jobs, why did the Democrats stop talking about extending unemployment benefits, when almost every voter has friends or family who've been without work for months or years?) Look at the remarkably simple stance of the only Democrat who ousted a big-deal Republican, Pennsylvania Gov.-elect Tom Wolf. Tax oil-and-gas companies. Fund schools. Pretty basic stuff.

Anyone who has ever been responsible for a child knows that being a parent is extremely challenging. From time to time – and sometimes even more often – we need to blend anger management skills with our parenting skills in order to remain calm and maintain control of our recalcitrant children. Learning anger management skills and improving our parenting capacity may not only make the day to day task of parenting easier, but it will also offer our children positive role modelling and better psychological health.
Being a parent is a huge responsibility. As a parent, you are shaping the life of another person. You hope that when they are young, you instill enough of your values and beliefs that when they become adults they are able to lead full and rich lives.
Not all children are easy to parent. Sometimes the issue is that a child's personality and temperament do not match that of the parent. If a parent is somewhat anxious and prone to anxiety, then a laid back child who has a relaxed approach to life events will drive the parent wild with anxiety and annoyance. By the same token, an anxious child may drive a relaxed parent up the wall because of the child's constant anxious reactions to minor life events and issues.

Another aspect of parenting that can make it difficult is a parent's own emotional issues. Parents who are depressed, anxious or facing other issues can find parenting especially challenging. If a parent feels ambivalent about being a parent, this can also contribute to their difficulties.
However, it is perfectly natural not to feel wonderful in every moment about being a parent. It is entirely normal to have moments when you do not enjoy being a parent or might even dislike your kids. This is not something that we talk about a great deal, but the reality is that the parent-child relationship, like any relationship, is fraught with a wide variety and range of emotions and feelings, not all of which are comfortable or enjoyable. So if you have moments when you feel like you want to toss in the towel, know that you are not alone, take a deep breath and find something to distract yourself with until your feelings pass.

Differences in parent/child temperament can be the source of many difficult parent/child interactions. Children can trigger unexpected emotional reactions and moments when we simply wish we were not parents. Children can be creative and extremely intelligent little people and often they know just how to push our buttons. This is why it's important for us to utilise anger management skills when dealing with our children. Here are a few more tips for basic anger management:
Keep your cool. Take a deep breath and make yourself slow down and count to 10 (or 20 or 100). Talk to your child in a low, calm voice. Step away from the situation if you can.
Be aware of when you are getting angry. When we get angry, our body responds by sending out adrenaline into the bloodstream. This burst of adrenaline causes our breathing to become shallow and our heart to race. If you feel yourself getting angry, then take a time out for yourself and walk away. It is okay to let your kids know you are angry by saying something like, “I am extremely angry with you right now, but I cannot talk to you. When I calm down, we will deal with this.” This is good modeling for your children and healthier for both of you. It is much better than blowing up and creating an emotional mess.
Find a distraction. When you take time out for yourself, find something else to do for a while and distract yourself. One great way to burn off the excess energy from an anger adrenaline rush is to exercise, take a walk or do something that involves movement. Let your mind wander and you may be surprised to find that you unconsciously find a solution to the problem with your child without intending to.
Be willing to listen to your child. Children are humans, just like the rest of us. Although it may not make sense to us, every behaviour has a motivation behind it. Part of our job as parents is to help children think through their process and understand their actions. Be willing to listen without jumping to conclusions. Think about why they may have behaved like they did.
Be patient with your child. Remember that children do not automatically know what they are doing and are not little adults. Part of our role as parents is to help them learn to understand themselves and be good role models for them, by acting responsibly and showing them the ropes to healthy living and interactions with others. If you show your children how you manage your own anger, as they grow up, they will hopefully learn to manage their own anger as well.

Just like our kids don't always know how to be good kids, we don't automatically know how to be good parents, even if we were lucky enough to have excellent parents ourselves. For most of us, parenting is something we learn on the fly. However, using the services of a counsellor, psychologist or therapist can help us work through our own feelings about being a parent and the uncomfortable feelings we may have about our children from time to time.
Professionally trained psychologists and counsellors can help parents improve their parenting skills by educating their clients about child development, age appropriate behaviours, logical and reasonable consequences, assertive communication and anger management.

• These argument cycles are usually caused by negative communication patterns that restrict understanding and respect in a relationship.
• A couples counsellor can help you and your partner understand and improve your communication habits and stop the constant arguments.
Psychologists and relationship counsellors will tell you that good communication is key to a successful relationship. And if you are arguing all the time, then chances are you are no longer communicating well!
Couples, especially couples who have been together for a long time, often get into argument cycles – where you find yourself constantly arguing about the same thing. Interestingly, while the topic of the repeated argument may change, the underlying triggers for the argument and the pattern the argument takes is often the same.
Think about what you and your partner fight about most. Probably something mundane like why the dishes weren’t put away, or why the kids aren’t in bed yet, or why you are out of tomatoes…
Arguments like these probably aren’t really about the dishes, the kids or the tomatoes… rather, you are probably getting into arguments about these things because you are simply not communicating well. Often, couples get into arguments about minor transgressions as a way to cover up real issues that have been left unaddressed. Failing to address and communicate about significant issues or concerns leads to resentment and repressed anger – both of which will ultimately lead to a dissatisfying relationship or relationship breakdown.
At other times the silly arguments are the result of negative communication patterns where both you and your partner are making assumptions and insinuations about what each of you are saying, playing into your frustrations and fears, failing to properly listen to each other. This kind of unhealthy communication is not always indicative of the way that you actually feel about each other - it’s just a nasty argument cycle that you can’t seem to avoid.
Couples counselling can help you understand and improve the way you communicate with your partner, teaching you skills such as empathy, patience and listening which can help you break your argument cycles.
Relationship counselling gurus Dr John Gottman and Dr Julie Schwartz Gottman* explain the four main communication issues which lead couples into negative argument cycles. These are:
Criticism happens when you are critical of your partner’s personality, rather than their action or behaviour. The Gottman’s distinguish a criticism from a complaint. They argue that expressing a complaint is an important component of a healthy relationship and reduces the liklihood of built-up suppressed anger. Expressing a criticism, however, involves making an accusation against the person’s personality. A complaint often starts with an “I”, whereas a criticism will often start with “You”. For example, a complaint might be “I’d love to eat less fattening food for dinner” whereas a criticism might be “You always cook such fattening food for us”.
Contempt commonly follows criticism and it is problematic because it can be poisonous for your relationship. Contempt, according to the Gottman model, is statements made with the intention of insulting or psychologically wounding your partner. Common ways in which contempt is often expressed in a relationship is through sarcastic remarks, antagonistic commentary, mocking behaviour or hostility. Contempt is a strong emotion but you would be surprised how often it is used amongst otherwise well-meaning couples. Contempt hurts your partner, and hurts your relationship.
Couples are often so focused on feeling defensive that it often becomes an instinctual reaction. It doesn’t matter what was said, or what was intended when they said it, the other person feels hurt and reacts defensively. Effectively, defensive reactions means you are likely pre-guessing, not listening, and probably over-reacting. You are also not going to be very good at solving real problems in your relationship and you are probably highly reactive and fighting a lot of the time.
Stonewalling happens in a relationship when one or both people in the relationship stop reacting or responding to each other. This occurs most often after all of the other communication patterns – criticism, contempt and defensiveness – have been a standard part of your relationship for some time. Likely, the couple is feeling so overwhelmed by the problems in their relationship that they simply withdraw emotionally from each other. Stonewalling is an active gesture in that it clearly intends to convey a lack of interest or care. Stonewalling is an indication that your relationship is coming unstuck.
All relationships suffer from these 4 communication patterns from time to time. It’s when these patterns become cyclical and habitual that you risk losing your relationship to ongoing arguments and intense dissatisfaction.
A trained relationship counsellor or couples therapist can help you identify your communication style, and offer you tools to help you avoid these negative communication patterns. With the help of a qualified psychologist or relationship counsellor, you can stop cyclical arguments in their tracks – and start enjoying your relationship again.

Keytha Fixico – What happens if the pipeline is completed? “The water gets ruined. Alabama pipeline wasn’t supposed to break, this one isn’t supposed to break. That can tell you what direction they’re headed.“
Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “Oh yeah, there’s so much energy here. Theres so much compassion here. Part of the reason people come out here is so they can relate to this situation in some way in their life. My tribe was part of the trail of tears and I couldn’t be there for them, but I can be here for this tribe.”
What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “It doesn’t make me happy. When you see a man of those kinds of actions and words you can only imagine what kind of government he will run.”
Alan Griego – What happens if the pipeline gets completed? “I haven’t given it too much thought, but there’s other pipelines and there’s still a lot of endangered waters and burial lands and Native American rights we’re fighting for. It’s not the end of it. It’s only one battle of many.”
Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “Absolutely. That’s one of my biggest things is getting off our dependence on petroleum products and switching over to more sustainable sources of fuel. There are tribes and nations together here that have historically been enemies and we’re uniting under a single cause. That’s pretty amazing.”
What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “I wish I could say it doesn’t. I really hope he’s just a puppet and the puppet controllers are not as crazy as he is. There are certain things I am worried about. John Sessions is now his attorney general. I’m worried about the repeal of Roe vs. Wade and the gay and lesbian rights. It’s kind of a setback for America and for progress.”
Ruth Miller – What happens if the pipeline is completed? “We will face not only an environmental impact in that human beings drinking water will forever be poisoned and polluted. It will also set a precedent that we are complicit in the continuation of over 400 years of colonization of our people. That we are complicit in the environmental racism against the Sioux nation and all indigenous people. And we are complicit in not allowing our voices and our presence to be recognized and heard. Not only will this have physical impacts on the quality of the watershed in this area, but it will set us up for another 400 years of oppression and we cannot allow that to continue.”
Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “I don’t think so. It’s true that its grounded in many different arguments in that this has been building up, not only for the 100s of years of colonization and occupation but this movement has been increasingly encouraged by the ongoing legal oppression of our rights as a sovereign nation. This is not just Indians getting crazy about one small thing, this is specifically in support of the Standing Rock Sioux. We’re coming to see this pipeline destroyed and dismantled.”
What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “As a native woman, I have been repeatedly antagonized and harassed, not only by the Trump campaign rhetoric but also by Trump supporters. As a student as well, I’ve been a part of an environment that is increasingly politicized and divided. Trump being elected wasn’t just racism. It was for many many people, but for many more people it was out of fear and desperation, very human emotions that people can relate to. We need to take this as a call to action, because Trump being elected is not just one crazy candidate, it’s symbolic of an endemic problem in this nation that needs to be addressed.“
Guadalupe – What happens if the pipeline gets built? “Lives will be destroyed. Land ruined forever. It will ruin generations of living.”
Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “Yes of course, because water is life.”
What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “I’m Chicano, Mexican American. I see a lot of my people come here with only the dream of the American Dream which is to work and build something off your hard labor. Thats what they come here for and the bias facts they are putting out are not fact. I think anyone who comes and are not committing any crime but working should be able to come here to provide for their family.”
Tabitha Milian – What happens if the pipeline gets completed? “Eventually it will leak and destroy water for 17 million people and it’s pretty much the same story that’s been happening for a while.”
Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “Yeah, this is pretty much resistance camps of the 21st century. As long as they stay focused on actually stopping and resisting these extraction plans and the sooner the better you can get them in the permitting process is more effective for sure.”
What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “I can’t just walk around feeling comfortable around white folks because there are a bunch of entitled white supremacist who feel that they can do what they want. It just feels like race wars are going to happen.”
Mark Johns-Colson – What happens if the pipeline is completed? “It endangers everyones water, everyone that lives south of here threatens their water supply.”
Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “It could, and it should. This isn’t the only pipeline protest going on. Theres Texas and other setting up just like they do here. This camp is not necessarily just fighting the pipeline, but it’s also a unity, bringing us all together. Reconnecting us to Mother Earth and realizing that Mother Earth is the source, not just a resource. It’s a turning point for people to reconnect with Mother Earth instead of disconnect.”
What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “Theres a lot of different ways that Rump will affect me as and igneous man of this land. Not just what he will do to Mother Earth and his lack of concerns for Mother Earth. Being a minority in this country, what is going to be over ridden. He has a vendetta against native Americans because of what happened in the 90s. It’s going to be interesting to see what happens.”
Foucault often spoke of critique in vague terms. A truth that “functions as a weapon,” on the one hand, but which can “light fires, watch the grass grow, listen to the wind, and catch the sea foam in the breeze and scatter it,” on the other. Statements like these appear to us as riddles. But what is critique for Foucault, really? One fascinating answer to this question can be found in his short piece, “What is Enlightenment?”
Now, I confess, when I was in graduate school I used to think this was one of the toughest bits of Foucault reading out there. I suppose I still do. Where I really struggle is later in the piece, when he gets into the opposition between two ideal types, the man of the modern world and the flâneur. Here, he paraphrases Baudelaire’s description of the flâneur as one who adopts “the spectator’s posture.” It seems to me that the flâneur is kind of a drop out, or somehow self-involved – a cynical figure who refuses to engage with the world around him. Either way, against this passive figure (which Foucault does not praise), the modern man has an active stance in the world. His being in the world somehow changes it, but not fundamentally. Foucault observes that the modern man’s attitude towards the world, and himself, involves both ambition and acceptance of certain limits to that ambition. That is, it “does not entail an annulling of reality, but a difficult interplay between the truth of what is real and the exercise of freedom.” In this sense, modern man is he who strives to take what is natural in the world, including his own self, and make it somehow more than it was. And the emblematic figure of the modern subject here is the dandy, the ultimate entrepreneur of himself, who is compelled constantly to “invent himself” in relation to those limits. Perfect, or at least moving towards some sort of optimal state.
There are thus two moves to the Enlightenment mentioned in the piece. On the one hand, the critical historicization of the self discussed early on, via Kant. On the other, the adoption of this aesthetic attitude towards oneself, which is the chief concern of the piece’s latter paragraphs. Curiously, however, it seems that Foucault feels this aesthetic attitude is not itself necessarily good or bad. On the one hand, it is sort of implied that he agrees with Baudelaire. That is, and “[h]ere I shall not recall in detail,” that the whole regime constituted by such an attitude forces its inhabitants to live in a fairly intolerable manner. The man of modernity is always “hurrying,” “searching,” “solitary,” “ceaselessly journeying.” To wit, it is an existentially harassed state of existence (conscious echoes of Heidegger?). On the other, however, there is a clear sense that, however harassing it might be, it is better to be repeating this artful attitude towards the self then to be encumbered with the dreadful and sanctimonious spirit of humanism! (Where the nature of the man who must be free is always somehow a given).
In this sense, Foucault wishes that we should eschew the “blackmail” of being for or against the enlightenment. Instead, he would have us return to some extent to Kant himself, and to the idea of critique. In Kant’s 1784 ‘Was ist Aufklärung?,’ a small essay published in the Berlinische Monatschrift, he sets out a sense of the time he believes he is living in. He appraises this time in a hermeneutic fashion, and in so doing spies the potential for something radically new. A political maturation of some sort, a becoming self-led or self-managed, is underway. There is no guarantee that it will emerge, but as the individual capacity for reason is developing, there is no reason not to let it have a greater voice in the public realm. Kant’s concern in relation to this transition is to nurture it, but also to establish sense of its necessary limits. Self-leadership is not appropriate, for example, in contexts where one’s views might better be kept to oneself, as in the case of a soldier in the military or someone who has to pay their taxes. For this reason, Kant argues that the most stable concrete configuration for furthering the cause of political maturity is that of “rational despotism.”
Such a position is hardly viable to the contemporary mind. Foucault cannot dismiss the piece on this basis, however. To the contrary, Kant has hitched freedom to a certain critical self-awareness or self-reflection about where the self should and should not be able to use reason, and for this reason Foucault takes the piece as figurative of a kind of emerging awareness of the need for individual responsibility, and responsibilization. And while in Kant’s hands the specific content of that responsibility is prescribed, for Foucault it is the form which is interesting, suggesting something essential about the political terrain upon which we live today. For at the centre of the contract Kant is proposing is precisely this ever-reflexive subject. Modernity is essentially an ethos, a way of life, predicated on an understanding that the essential condition of its own possibility is its unique way of relating to reality. That is, in Foucault’s terms, modernity is made possible only by the “ontology of ourselves.”
Now, we might find this a bit of a surprise. Many of us, conservatives and liberals alike, are used to thinking of modernity as a complete and utter catastrophe. Nevertheless, says Foucault, we should pay attention. For what can it mean to live like this? The modern life, as we have said, is one predicated on the relentless critique of the self. Kant suggested that the proper place of such critique was the public sphere. But what if no such limit were posited? What if, in fact, we embraced a mode of critical thinking that was not hitched to any sort of universalized rationality? What if we embraced one that was, instead, fully “genealogical in its design and archaeological in its method.” One that would see the ‘necessary’ limits of reason as merely “historical events”? For Foucault, we find in this mode “the possibility of no longer being, doing, or thinking what we are, do, or think.” That is, the possibility of taking the energy of that harassed and restlessly entrepreneurial subject, and turning it towards the “undefined work of freedom.”
“this means that the historical ontology of ourselves must turn away from all projects that claim to be global or radical. In fact we know from experience that the claim to escape from the system of contemporary reality so as to produce the overall programs of another society, of another way of thinking, another culture, another vision of the world, has led only to the return of the most dangerous traditions.”
At first glimpse, this appears to strike a rather reactionary tone. Like Edmund Burke perhaps, Foucault is advocating a gradualist approach, of “partial transformations.” But it is not clear that Foucault himself believes this to be a conservative position. As the above quote makes clear, we avoid the pursuit of radical revolution not so much to prevent or delay radical change per se but, rather, in the hope that such change might come about in a manner that does not also produce the intensified power relations and constraints on freedom that we find traditionally accompanying revolutionary programs.
For Foucault then, the only real path forward is the aesthetic one, a “work carried out by ourselves upon ourselves as free beings.” He well understands that there is a question of the sort of “practical system” that might produce this. But he sidesteps this question, reaffirming once again that the only viable method is one of relentless engagement with the historic “modes of problematization” that yield who we are: the relations between people and things; people and other people; and people and their own selves.
The question then is how to work towards freedom, within the space of the Enlightenment, but without a totalizing ethos of transformation? But what might such work look like? Is Foucault advising us, for example, not to pursue grand transformative strategy at all? Or is it not more plausible he thinks that the slow, gradualist approach might have some sort of positive net cumulative effect? I think the latter far more plausible. And, reading this piece again, one wonders the extent to which this argument about critique has shaped the agenda of movements like Occupy Wall Street (OWS). David Graeber, one of the key intellectuals behind OWS, has argued that horizontal movements are only possible in societies that are already to some extent liberal. The affinity with Foucault’s argument is, for me, quite strong here. For in the commitment of such movements to prefigurative politics and piecemeal cultural change, they exhibit precisely the sort of experimental attitude that Foucault is endorsing.
So, in the piece we see Foucault offering neither an endorsement nor an outright criticism of modernity. In this sense, the piece gives us perhaps a valuable insight into his work, and his tendency to take ambiguous stances (in his discussion of neoliberalism, for example). Perhaps the point is simply to say, and here echoing Marx’s famous comment on capitalism, that while the modern ethos is far from ideal, its the best we have developed yet. For, at the very least, it affords us this margin of freedom where we can start to countenance this question of ontology, and our intimate relationship to power. And in this I feel Foucault would not be opposed to the kind of thinking that seems to have inspired the movements. If we look at key ‘Occupy’-relevant thinkers like Graeber, or Hardt and Negri, their advice to the movements all seems to rotate around this idea of a slow, patient program of self-transformation, of a certain withdrawal, or exodus, and of becoming the change we want to see. Indeed, here I am drawn to Gene Holland’s recently-coined term, the ‘slow-motion general strike.’ Precisely!
Each of these approaches is inspired by the idea that we can step back from the world, create our own time, and engage in a form of personal and collective transformation that will hopefully spillover into the lifeworld, and create the possibility of that other world we all hope is still somehow possible. That the stakes are high is quite clear. Alarmingly, however, the gap of freedom is narrowing. Foucault’s hope for critique holds good only so long as we can identify some semblance of the intellectual space enlightened order affords. But what good can such hopeful thinking do in the context of a general erosion of that space? In a time when we see a general encroachment of the state on civil liberties, and an expansion of corporate power in its project of debt enslavement? These, I think, are critical questions.

Glad to see you wrestling with this piece. I am not ashamed to admit that I still find this essay both vital to unpacking Foucault’s project (and perhaps our own work?) AND simultaneously quite difficult to wrap my head around in several places.
Thanks Joel. Yeah, its always been a kind of bête noire for me. The flirtation with Kant, etc. Honestly tho, reading it now, it all seems to make so much more sense. I’m now actually of a mind that it is central to understanding biopolitics. (And not Agamben’s biopolitics!).

The striking Chandra image of supernova remnant, SNR 0103-72.6, reveals a nearly perfect ring about 150 light years in diameter surrounding a cloud of gas enriched in oxygen and shock heated to millions of degrees Celsius. The ring marks the outer limits of a shock wave produced as material ejected in the supernova explosion plows into the interstellar gas. The size of the ring indicates that we see the supernova remnant as it was about 10,000 years after its progenitor star exploded.
Oxygen and neon are the most abundant elements in the remnant, evidence that the star that exploded was at least ten times as massive as the Sun. Oxygen is synthesized by nuclear reactions in the interiors of such stars. When such a star explodes, its core collapses to form either a neutron star, or if massive enough, a black hole, and the material surrounding the core is propelled into interstellar space.
Scientists have known for years that oxygen and many other elements necessary for life are created in massive stars and dispersed in supernova explosions, but few supernova remnants rich in these elements are observed. This is because the supernova ejecta become mixed with the interstellar gas after about 20 thousand years. Since most observed supernova remnants are older than this, only a few, younger remnants will still be rich in oxygen.
SNR 0103-72.6 is located in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) about 190,000 light years from Earth. The X-rays take about 190,000 years to reach us from the SMC, so the supernova explosion occurred about 200,000 years ago, as measured on Earth. One of the closest galaxies to our Galaxy, the SMC is visible to the naked eye from the Southern Hemisphere.
This supernova remnant will become an important laboratory for studying how stars forge the elements necessary for life. Although SNR 0103-72.6 is more distant than supernova remnants in our Galaxy, scientists have a clear view of it because its light is not blocked by the dusty spiral arms of our Galaxy.

C24 is a primordial landscape for living together. A permanent home for a community of a 100, a house for many who all voluntarily choose to exclude themselves from society. Within this space they come together to share new, perfected ways of being in the world – performing mundane, quotidian acts defined by the sun – resting, eating, sleeping – as a form of collective resistance against and freedom from the pervasive technological exploitation and control in our everyday lives.
A domestic space defined solely by the inhabitant’s migration across the landscape, movement within is not prescribed but only triggered by changing light conditions – from increased luminosity to dark shade – where spatial conditions always synchronize circadian rhythms through their use and occupation.
A foam-like ground as a continuous bed surface allowing for dozing and drowsing through the entire space, certain moments in the daily life of the inhabitants are shared. While meal times become occasions to gather for the conviviality of eating, all lying down to rest as being nourished, at the fall of the day they make their way to the dunes covered in complete black darkness to perform the act of sleeping together – celebrated as the ultimate form of resistance and freedom from any technological exploitation, night by night, waiting for a new day to come.
To find words to describe what receiving honours means is truly an impossible task – as I already felt the luckiest to have spent these great years here, with all of you. Tutors and friends as one could never hope for, without whom this surely would have never ever been possible. Thank you, for everything.
We will continue to deliver produce as along as possible. Because of a series of events (see below), we have decided to suspend the farming operations sometime during the 2015 season.
1. The hoop house finally arrived. It was smashed beyond recognition and delivery and erection of another one for the Fall 2015 became very questionable.
2. On the same day, the MSU extension Service advised us not to grow fruit because of the fungus infestation in the water table. We have a high water table and we have no place for the water to go even if we tiled the ground. This explains why the terrific loss for fruit trees and other fruiting plants that have sputtered and died.
We have been working with the extension specialist all season long. Their visit on Friday was devastating.
3. The labor force we assembled for 2015 has come up short. From weeding, harvesting and going to market, it has become too much for me and especially Pisha.
4. After having my fourth chemotherapy treatment, I can no longer work more than several hours a week. Regardless of the P.E.T. scan done yesterday, the 2015 season is in jeopardy. We can continue to deliver as much of the produce as we can.
The decision is base on a series of events, not just on or two. We have worked tirelessly for the last 5 years trying to develop the land into a sustainable produce operation. We had spent well over $150,000. The MSU experts, the doctors and the labor force have spoken. We finally listened. Our decision is based on the four major events that have unfolded over the first half of 2015.
We apologize for not being able to provide everyone with fresh farm produce for the remainder of 2015 on a regular basis. Like I stated earlier, WE WILL CONTINUE TO DELIVER AS LONG AS WE CAN!!!!!! At the end of the season (determined by us) we will provide a statement of account for produce delivered or picked by the members and a refund of the difference shall be remitted to each member.
That is very devastating news. As a small business owner, I strongly identify with the 'behind-the-scenes' sacrifices that must be made to follow your dream. Is there a chance that members can/will rally around to save the season?
I have offered to pick produce when I can for Jon and the other members as well. Jon may have gotten some other responses as well from some of the other members. I'm not sure.
Second-hand experience in why one doesn't really want to be a farmer. I hope that Jon has some kind of insurance/fallback.
Sorry to hear about this, Todd. I always feel for the farmers when the weather does not cooperate. Growing all these things is just a hobby for me, but it is their livelihood. I hope farmer Jon and the members can at least save some of it.
I guess it's official that Farmer Jon is selling his acreage. I am making him For Sale signs this weekend.
This casserole is simple and delicious, and makes a perfect snack during a picnic (bento anyone?)—you should use it as a basic idea for a casserole, since the pasta sauce is the stable and the most important piece of the meal. It's also a very tweak-able recipe! :-)
This is one of my signature dishes—it's delicious, rich and hearty, and goes well with any kind of base: pasta, potatoes, and rice just taste superb together. My secret to the intensive, flavorful sauce is the triple reduction of the ingredients' fluids, due to cooking in batches and mixing in specific order. It takes some time, but the result is so much worth it! :-)
Nothing compliments the strawberries like the cream-cheese icing, and you can enjoy this taste even off-season with strawberry jam! :-) You can skip limit the calories in this recipe by using lighter strawberry jam, or pulverized strawberries, and using half of the sugar in the cupcake part if you want the cupcakes less sweet.
I was busy today with shopping and home chores, and needed something to snack on and get some energy kick. I managed to buy some chili peppers earlier today, and decided to make a savory scrambled eggs with a delicious, energetic spicy twist! :-) And oh my, that was both tasty and exciting!
Traditional-made doughnuts are made with yeast dough, and deep-fried to make a fluffy, delicious spongy cake. It requires a lot of work to cook them, though, but for quick snacks (Sunday breakfast maybe?) the easier way are the baked cake doughnuts—which are spongy, fluffy and delicious too!

Ha egy falkatag elhagyja a farkasfalkát, a hátramaradottak nem a stressz miatt vonyítanak, hanem a kapcsolataikat fejezik ki ezzel.

Trouble Magazine recently asked me to write a short article about Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston who wrote comic books under the pen name of Charles Moulton until his death from cancer in 1947 at the age of 54. Turns out that the exceptionally gifted Moulton (he was a psychologist, lawyer and educational consultant amongst other occupations!) channeled some of his secret sexual predilections into his Wonder Woman stories—the main one being S&M and B&D. For those of you who don't know what these acronyms stand for, read the upcoming quote from a letter to his publisher for a clue...
This, my dear friend, is the one truly great contribution of my Wonder Woman strip to moral education of the young. The only hope for peace is to teach people who are full of pep and unbound force to enjoy being bound… Only when the control of self by others is more pleasant than the unbound assertion of self in human relationships can we hope for a stable, peaceful human society… Giving to others, being controlled by the submitting to other people cannot possibly be enjoyable without a strong erotic element.
... and then trot over to the online version of Trouble Magazine (September 2012 edition) and read the entire article for yourself.

Man, I don’t know what it is this year. Last year I only had one rain out, and that was a minor league game, and one rain shortened game. This year I have been dodging the rain left and right. My trip to Wrigley was no exception. The game was completed, but after the 6th inning there was some rain. You know what smells worse than a wet dog? A wet 101 year-old ballpark.
Speaking of Wrigley, I hate the new scoreboards. They are HUGE, hi-def and would be a great addition to any ballpark except Wrigley or Fenway. When you have a 100+ year-old sports venue, part of the appeal and charm is that you can get a feel of how it was back in the day. Wrigley has lost some of its innocence with the addition of those electronic behemoths. The Cubs have talked for years about building a new ballpark somewhere in the Chicago suburbs. Now may be the time to move on that idea.
The good news is they fared way better this year than last. I had the Buffalo Wing Dog. I know what you are thinking, “it’s Wrigley, why not have the Chicago Dog.” Well, I did…last year. It was delicious. The problem is that the Chicago Dog is so famous EVERY team offers one. Sure, it is a Chicago Dog in Chicago. That doesn’t make it taste better. And it sure as hell would not be unique. So I opted for the best choice to help the Cubbie’s score.
The Buffalo Wing Dog is a footlong Vienna Beef frank topped with coleslaw and shredded chicken and buffalo sauce.
Ingredients-I expected it to be topped with chicken wings. It was shredded chicken instead. Good thing, I would hate to have had to deal with those tiny bones on my dog. The meat was tasty and good quality. 4.5
Uniqueness-not the first team to top a dog with shredded chicken. Just the first one I know of to add buffalo sauce to it. 4
Monstrosity Factor-while it was a large dog, it was not huge. Lots of meat but not so much you feel compelled to share. I probably could have eaten most of another. You will be pleased to know I did not. 4
Value-considering I have spent $8 for just a regular dog at one other MLB venue, the same amount for this large, tasty specialty dog is a good price. And for most people, one is a meal. 5
Overall Taste-I was pleased that they put just the right amount of buffalo sauce on the dog. It complemented the dog and was not overpowering. All ingredients played well together and left my mouth very pleased. 5
A score of 27.5 is good score for the aging Wrigley. The installation of the Decade Dogs stand, where you can get your specialty dogs, is a fine addition to one of the grand old ladies of baseball. But get rid of those scoreboards, it is like watching your great-grandma trying to use an Apple Watch.

Xihu Lunjing is the king of Chinese green teas. It is one of the most classy and highly demanded green teas in the Celestial Empire. Only top and “youngest” leaves are used to produce Lunjing. The main reason behind its high price is the tiresome process of growing and harvesting of the most consumed tea in China.
Lunjing is grown in five regions of China: Xifeng, Lunjing, Uyungshang, Hulao and Meixiao. The greatest Lunjing among them is the Lunjing grown on Shifeng Mountain. Since the rule of Qings dynasty, thanks to the emperor Xuanglun’s good graces, Lunjing tea is called “Imperial”. Xihu Lunjing embodies the poetic atmosphere of the Shifeng Mountain along with the divine color, taste and aroma of the brew that formed a whole separate tea culture in China.
Gentle, a bit oily, yet bright and springy aroma complemented by an exquisite taste wait for you in a teapot full with Lunjing tea. Lasting and gentle, though a bit sweet aftertaste invokes bright sensations.
Chinese doctors claim that Lunjing tea has a beneficial effect on lungs and helps toxins and heavy metals discharge from the organism. It also purifies your skin, improves sight and focus, and helps to overcome depression by pacifying your inner world, helping it to harmonize with the outer one. Lunjing contains many healthy amino acids, vitamin C and catechols that delay aging effectively.
Oolong tea, also known as “Temple of Heaven” or Qing Cha, also known as “turquoise tea” holds a specific place between red(black) and green teas in Chinese tea classification system because of specific processing they undergo. This tea is semifermented. The ideal ratio is 50% fermented, 50% non-fermented. To achieve that, only margins of tea leaves and a part of their surface are subject to fermentation. Inner layers remain non-fermented and keep their chemical structure. By this virtue, Oolong teas save a rich scent bouquet characteristic for black tea and have a rich taste of a green tea. Oolong teas can be divided in two categories: low-fermented (green Oolongs) and high-fermented (such Oolongs pertain more to black tea).
Nevertheless, Oolong teas are a separate category of teas that has that contains all the benefits of both black and green teas. A true oolong tea can be defined by the color of brew. When brewed, margins of every tea leaf will look like black tea ones, while the remainder will look like green tea ones. Tea leaves for Oolong teas are collected four times a year, but spring and autumn harvests are traditionally considered to be the best. All the specifics and peculiarities of an Oolong tea can be experienced by attending a ”Quangfu Cha” tea ceremony held in China. The ceremony is never performed with flavoured Oolongs, save only milk and ginger ones, and even those are rarely allowed to be a part of the ceremony by the Chinese masters. Such a privilege is granted only to elite sorts of Chinese green tea.
Oolong teas have a long traditional history in China and Taiwan. There's a wide range of Oolongs existent that you can taste while having lunch in Almaty, but many of them remain insde their motherland as non-export sorts. Every type of Oolong is unique, with its own taste and aroma peculiarities.

Pim recently announced the Menu for Hope 4 – last year I offered an Artigianale Basket full of Italian products, and this year I hope to make it even better!
FREE STUFF! After you read my list, leave a comment by December 1st about what non-perishable gift you’d love from Italy in the comments (even if I’ve already listed it) and I will send one lucky commenter this Illy collector’s tin (full of Illy coffee) designed by Michael Lin!
Scents found in soaps and bath gels in a country reflect that culture and their tastes. If anything, it may be something you’ve never smelled before. Nothing says “Italy” like Gianduja (hazelnut chocolate) bath gel!
Aquolina– Perhaps my favorite brand of bath soaps, they have some very different scents like lychee (litchi fruit), marzipan, cardamom and blackberry musk, which means the recipient is sure to enjoy a unique-smelling gift. I love the Cannella de Ceylon, cinnamon body wash and their recent “Chocolovers” line is delicious.
Pupa – the very playful packaging and lines named “Miss Milkie” and “Polly’s Beauty Farm” make it seem like Pupa is aimed at a younger crowd, but scents like mandorla (almond) or coffee and the fun packages could tickle anyone’s fancy.
L’Erbolerio Erboristeria – “A herbalist’s shop” – Based near Milan in Lodi, L’Erbolario carries a bevy of natural products and scents, and these stores are all over Italy.
The Pupa and Aquolina brands can be easily found at your local “profumeria” – L’Erbolario has its own stores. I like the Limoni profumeria chain as they usually have a good selection and can be found in most Italian cities. Sephora, one of my favorite beauty stores I grew to love in Paris and then back in California, is also becoming quite popular and has numerous stores all over Italy.
Some Pupa items are available on Amazon, or Pupa has a list of worldwide distributors you can call or email for info. L’Erbolario has a list of distributors in the world as well as a good selection on Amazon. Amazon also has a selection of Aquolina products, mainly the popular body sprays and perfume from their popular Pink Sugar line.
Well-deserving its own category, the Santa Maria Novella Farmacia is just one of those places you know if you’re in the know. If you like wonderful scents and retro packaging, you’ll love anything from the SMN Farmacia. Considered to be the oldest continuously-running pharmacy in Europe, the ornate insides of their stores are as charming as their products. My favorite scents are Verbena, Mandorla (almond) and Melograno (Pomegranate). Their bars of soap make excellent small gifts and the perfume is great for a special someone. Other favorites are the Acqua di Sicilia, the Rose Water and the foot and hand creams (Crema per le Mani and Pasta di Mandorle), as well as the moisturizers.
Visit one of their exclusive locations in Italy. The store in Florence is not only the original site, it’s also the biggest.
| Firenze Via della Scala 16 – Firenze – Italy | Roma Corso del Rinascimento, 47 – 00186 Roma | Milano Corso Magenta, 22 – 20123 Milano |
How could I mention Italy without touching at all on the food, oh the wonderful food! Unfortunately, the best part about Italian food is the freshness and eating it surrounded by wonderful sights and history, and this doesn’t fit well into a suitcase.
Menu for Hope Basket – of course I think all of the great items from my Artigianale basket last year were wonderful gifts like the truffle oil and Nduja! This year I’m going to give you another chance to win in December!
Chocolate from Modica – People either love or hate this grainy, crystallized chocolate. I love it. I blogged about fair trade Modica chocolate, which is cheaper than the non-fair trade version (go figure) and still delicious. I recommend the cannella (cinnamon), peperoncino (hot pepper), zenzero (ginger) or te’ verde (green tea) varieties.
Sott’olio – Vegetables “under oil” (like the eggplant under oil I made in July) are popular gifts and just have to be transported correctly! I wrap mine well in plastic and put them in a box with sturdy sides if I have one. I suggest eggplant, sundried tomatoes, artichokes or hot peppers for great gift ideas.
Saffron – some sustain that the quality of saffron in Italy is better than elsewhere, but any cook would welcome a little jar of saffron to make some risotto Milanese.
Dried porcini mushrooms – Porcini have their own fans, and bags of dried porcinis can make a lovely dish back home. Some even swear by the porcini-flavored broth cubes Star sells here.
Guaranteed classics – Balsamic vinegar, Honey, olive oil, limoncello and cioccolata calda (hot chocolate) are always good gifts, and you never know when you’ll find your new favorite. I also recommend getting a bit different like chestnut or cherry flower honey or peppery-olive oil.
Specialty food stores, like Peck in Milan, Castroni in Rome and Eataly in Turin are excellent sources of high quality, limited-production manufacturers. Or stop by an Italian supermarket before you fly out – you’ll find that the prices are not-touristy and you’ll find some interesting brands and products to take back home. Popular supermarket chains include Standa, SMA (pronounced smah), Coop, and Esselunga. Check online or ask for directions to your nearest one and stock up!
Modica chocolate: The fair trade version is sold in Altromercato’s “Bottega del Mondo Altromercato” stores all over Italy, and some in Greece, Malta and Portugal. The classic version of Modica chocolate can be found in specialty food shops and some gelaterias.
Note: Read your country’s custom limitations before planning to stuff your suitcase full of no-nos like buffalo meat and fresh yogurt. Chowhound has a good thread about customs questions being answered by a supposed US Customs agent, but be sure to read official government documentation.
Amazon has a varied supply of these Italian gourmet food, including the Casa Don Puglisi chocolate from Modica I tasted in the US in March that was almost identical to the brand I buy here. I found it at Whole Foods, which is another good resource for hard-to-find Italian products in the US, Canada and UK. San Lorenzo food will ship everything from mozzarella di buffala to limoncello within Europe.
Alessi – Alessi is as known for being quirky as much as being very sleek. How one brand can be both of those things is hard to conceive, but Alessi is. I just can’t resist this cute blue bunny toothpick holder for my dad.
Pasta machine – Time hasn’t really needed to improve upon the classic pasta machine’s design. This pasta machine from Villaware has the traditional “Imperia” stamped on it.
Espresso cups – this is the set I have in my house, but this black and white espresso cup set from Bodum is versatile and stylish!
Moka makers (Espresso on your stovetop) – Read more about How to Order an Italian Coffee in Italy to learn what you need for making moka is at home. Shelley also profiled the Tazza d’Oro where you can order some coffee beans to go!
Olive wood cutting boards – beautiful keepsakes and a great cook’s helper. Williams-Sonoma carries a lovely olivewood cheese board.
Mezzaluna – how could you not want to gift something whose name is in Italian? Mezzaluna means “half moon” and is an excellent chopper! Get the classic, two-handled version, or a modern update from Kitchenaid.
La Rinascente department store has a good selection of household goods and brands, and is present in most of the big cities in Italy like Milano, Roma, Firenze. Their website has an English version, otherwise click on “Gli Store” and you’ll be taken to a list of cities and addresses.
Amazon has a good selection of Alessi products and my Kitchen tool lists (click here for part 1 and part 2) have many Italian products sprinkled in. Alessi also has an online shop for USA, UK, the Netherlands and Germany. Williams Sonoma was my first introduction to food porn when I was little, and I love wandering their stores even today – gift an Italian tomato press or Imperia pasta machine for your “serious” cook.
For me, Venice has its own section in the gift guide. It’s not only a city, it’s a shopping destination, and I usually make a trek once a year for gift buying. I could (and do) spend days shopping when I’m in Venice, and I always find something unique for everyone on my list.
Venetian glass, and more specifically glass from the Murano island, can be beautiful works of art. Recently there has been an influx of “Chinese glass” in Venice being sold as Venetian glass. Unfortunately, there is no good rule-of-thumb about how to tell which is the real Venetian glass, so purchase with care. If you are making a substantial purchase of Murano glass, make sure you see a Vetro Artistico Murano sticker on it.
Necklaces – It’s been more than 10 years that I’ve been buying glass necklaces, and I haven’t run out of styles yet. There are types and styles to suit every woman or girl on your list. I’ve become a recent fan of Marina e Susanna Sent necklaces, but unfortunately they have no website. They have two stores in Venice that Google gives you the address for.
Glass plates – Ercole Moretti & Fratelli is my favorite brand of these little display plates. Make sure you find the “M” in the glass before buying one of their products.
Glass tree ornaments – these are beautiful and often can be found with their own gift boxes so it makes packing them easier. I prefer the traditional, glass-blown globes.
Classics – Wine bottle stoppers, ashtrays, little glass candy or glass pens, you’ll find something for everyone.
Shopping in Venice is best done by walking around. Almost no two necklaces, vases or statues are alike and deserve a good look. I have my favorites, but I think treatment in Venice is based largely from person-to-person and one person’s rude is another person’s welcome. I do have a suggestion, though. If you’re undecided about something, leave the store, but don’t go far. Get a coffee close to the store, think about your purchase, and then go back if you want it. “Coming back later” are famous last words in Venice and continuously navigating the narrow streets and crowds will suck all desire to come back later, given you can find it in the maze! But when you arrive back home, you’ll be kicking yourself. Stick close by until you’ve decided. Worst case? You have an extra gift to give.
Other than shopping in Venice itself, there are some places you can find Venetian glass in Italy. La Murrina (site appears to work only with IE) is all over Italy and guarantees the quality of the work being shown.
This is one thing that I’m not really comfortable recommending purchasing outside of Italy. If you try a site like eBay, there is the risk of finding fake products. Buyer beware.
Italy is a high-fashion mecca for many. I am not an expert or specialist since I refuse to spend that much money on clothes. But, I will share a few low-to-mid range favorites that will make a special treat for someone.
Purses – My favorite brand is Furla, and they have many stores in Italy as well as throughout the world. Coccinelle (view site in IE) is another great, mid-range Italian brand. Not ready to buy a purse? Consider a wallet, keychain or coin purse.
Gloves – Gloves have become very important to me, especially while living in Milan. Madova gloves (in Florence) are well-loved, as well as Sermoneta but there are tons of little glove stores tucked away in every town.
Leather jackets – Leather is another buyer beware item in Italy. In Florence you will find beautiful leather and low-quality leather. If you want to buy a jacket in Italy, I would look for a style, color or other unique characteristic to make that jacket a must-buy, and go for it!
Scarves – I love, love buying scarves in Italy. Unfortunately, most of the scarves you see in the markets and even in most stores are probably made in India / outside Italy. Shop with care.
If you came to Italy for a high-fashion bargain, you’ll probably go away disappointed. Unless 500euro for a T-shirt is a bargain for you, and that means this guide is probably not for you. I wouldn’t bother with the Via Montenapoleone (Milano) or Via dei Condotti (Roma) unless you enjoy window-shopping or have a particular goal in visiting these high-fashion showplaces.
Italy also has outlet centers, the most famous being “the Mall” in Leccio Reggello, outside of Florence, and the McArthur Glen Designer Outlets in Serravalle (northern Italy, Piemonte). Corriere della Sera has a list of malls and outlet centers in Italy, McArthur has links to their outlet centers in Italy.
Madova gloves have an online catalog and store, Furla and Coccinelle both have several stores outside of Italy.
Perhaps my favorite category as I’m a big list-maker. When I first came to Italy, I was fascinated by the marbled and fleur de lis paper in Florence. I also bought a blank, leather-bound book to use as a diary. Now I carry a Moleskine around in my purse all day every day, a ready receptacle for my ideas.
Florentine paper – Before email, people wrote letters on actual paper to each other. Marbled paper, paper with the fleur de lis, even Botticelli’s Venus decorate the pages of stationery sets found in Florence.
Moleskine – A French company until the late 80s, in the past 10 years, an Italian company started manufacturing these characteristic little black notebooks. I’ve already bought my red agenda for 2008 and am using a few of the cahier notebooks for undercover assignments. Their city notebooks also make a good present for a traveler (note: they are not guides) filled with maps and space to take notes and observations about that particular city.
Yearly calendars – If the person you’re buying for isn’t ready for a soulful trip into the Moleskine philosophy, check out hundreds of other agendas, many with Italian sayings or influences.
Wine lover’s diary – this is a great idea for the wine lover in your life – a small, palm-sized book where they can write the details of various vintages they sample and their thoughts.
The best place to get inspired by Florentine paper is at the San Lorenzo market. Be sure and visit the more specialty paper shops in the area surrounding it for something truly authentic. I don’t have a favorite, and most paper sellers’ websites are horrendous, but there are a few stores in Florence that you can visit and possibly order from online: Signum, Lilium and Parione.
To buy Moleskine and other agendas, the big chain bookstores in Italy will have a good selection – Mondadori and La Feltrinelli both have numerous stores all over Italy.
I added a few Moleskine models to my eStore, but Amazon has a much larger selection available that can’t be added to an estore. Moleskine also has a list of locations where their notebooks can be found in the world, highlighting Barnes & Noble, Borders, Feltrinelli, FNAC, and Mondadori. Amazon also has a small selection of Florentine paper and products.
I love music, and living in Italy means I can often enjoy free concerts like Festival Bar this summer, and hear the latest “it” songs. Music for me has a way of recalling past emotions and experiences, so even if I don’t love the song, I can often remember an event or feeling I had surrounding it.
Ask for the latest “Compilation” – popular recurring compilations are NOW!, Hit Dance Mania or Festival Bar and have a good mix of English and Italian songs popular in Italy right now. Keep up to date with RadioItalia’s Italian music chart or MTV’s Hitlist Italia chart.
I try to keep my Italian Music page in my estore updated for some great Italian albums – there’s over 40 now!
Giorgia on MTV Unplugged – Though some people think she has a bit of an attitude, I think some of it is deserved – she has a soulful voice and is excellent live. Highlights from the CD are: “Infinite Volte,” a poignant love song, or “Gatta sul Tetto” which always makes me dance with its hard bass line.
Elisa: Soundtrack 1996-2006 – Though many of her songs are in English, she is firmly in the hearts of the Italian public. I love “Gli Ostacoli del Cuore” as well as her older songs like “Rainbow” which I heard years ago when I discovered her while still in the US.
The Best of Nek – I continuously say Nek’s good for beginner Italian learners, and it’s true. He sings pretty clear, and his pop songs are light and enjoyable.
BONUS: Yo-Yo Ma plays Ennio Morricone – though instrumental, Yo-Yo Ma’s interpretation of Ennio Morricone’s classics are moving. I used one of the songs in my wedding (I won’t say which!)
La Feltrinelli and Mondadori are good places to buy books as well as music – Messaggerie Musicali stores used to be separate stores, but they’ve been acquired by Mondadori, so the sign may remain, but they are the same store.
La Vita e’ Bella – Life is Beautiful – though I feel biased since part of this movie was shot in the town I studied in, in Tuscany, it is a beautiful and moving film. Leave the Italian and put on English subtitles.
Under the Tuscan Sun – though it’s a bit of a “americanata” – meaning Hollywood put its hands into this film a little too much, you are guaranteed some lovely visuals and moments for the Italy lover. Filmed in Cortona, near where I studied.
Il Postino – that the lead star, Massimo Troisi, died shortly after filming stopped lends a certain nostaglia to the film before you start it, but it paints a wonderful picture of Procida and the ordinary beauty of daily life.
BONUS: Only You or Stealing Beauty: – though neither of these films are cinematic masterpieces, the scenes and places from the films will definitely invoke a reaction for any Italy lover.
I don’t really recommend buying films in Italy unless you’re sure your DVD player can play them. Music, movies and books are found at Mondadori and La Feltrinelli.
I could go on and on about gift ideas. In fact, I’ve gone on too long already. Here are some other ideas that I may cover in more depth later.
FREE STUFF! Remember, now leave a comment by December 1st about what non-perishable gift you’d love from Italy in the comments (even if I’ve already listed it) and I will send one lucky commenter this Illy caffe’ collector’s tin designed by Michael Lin!
You forgot to mention that fabulous Pucci shirt I tried on last year in Florence that made me look like a million bucks…and cost almost as much.
Whenever we go back to Italy for vacation, we always try to bring back canned tuna. There is nothing like Rio Mare canned tuna to put on top of crackers, add to a basic tomato sauce to go over pasta, etc. – other brands just will not do. The American version of tuna in olive oil can not even compare. We always get laughs at the local grocery store when we buy their entire inventory before our trip home. Then you just have to make it last until the next vacation!
I’m going back to Venice in January. We love visiting Murano, it’s so laid back. The further you walk on Murano the less touristy it becomes.
My addition would be Cinema Paradiso on DVD. It’s my absolute all-time favourite Italian film, beautifully made, very authentic and guaranteed to bring a tear to the eye of even the most hard-core viewer.
My husband, who is Italian, and I visited Italy 15 years ago, and purchased an Alessi cafeteira which lasted until recently. It made terrific espresso.
I did find a nice Italian flag for my honey. He tried to find one when he was in Italy visiting his family. I found one on the web and he will get it for Christmas.
This list is very timely. I was trying to think of what to get a friend from Italian class who is moving to Florence next year. The wine diary is a fantastic idea, can we stop by a Feltrinelli in Milan?
Great list! (What a thorough researcher you are)! I love espresso (illy, lavazza, etc), espresso makers, olive oil, pesto, duplo chocolates (sorry, both perishable), cake mixes, cookbooks, any book for that matter, old photos and postcards. street art. oh, and magazines. :o)
I love those Moleskine books! Would love one for myself, but just bought one for Rome for my friend to use when we are there in March.
All of the above, yes please! We were just in Italy in September and I wish I would have bought a few more yummy culinary delights to bring home. I did buy my husband a Moka maker for christmas because he became addicted to the one in our villa!
Marvis toothpaste – the best; kitchen towels with Italian recipes from Sermoneta in Rome; honey infused with white truffle oil-perfect served with Pecorino di Pienza-I purchased a jar at the market in Florence
I would love to find a vintage Vespa, in full functioning order of course, under my tree! However, if that is no possible, I would be most happy with a yummy pandoro.
What a great list! I would love anything from Santa Maria Novella or Limoni. Visited both when in Florence. I am a girle girl- so I could get lost in places like that for hours. I picked up some Lobello lip balm and Aquolina Pink Sugar perfume in Limoni and everybody at work said I was making them hungry for cookies!! I also love olivewood, large Venetian glass mosaic pendants, marble paper and Florentine paper greeting cards! I could go on and on……
One of my favorites is the Latte por il Corpo from Santa Maria Novella. I also love all of the L’Erborerio Erboristeria products. When I was in Bellagio several years ago, my hotel had the bathroom stocked with them. I totally hoarded them! I’ve never seen them in the States.
Fantastic read as usual. I would love to try some of the Santa Maria Novella products. I was interested in them to begin with and then reading Sticky gooeycreammy chewy’s endorsement, I really must try something especially for the hands.
This is a great post, thanks! I’m living in Florence now it’s time to start thinking what I should be bringing back to the states. From Santa Maria Novella, my must-buy is the potpourri in a silk bag. Their men’s soap scented with potpourri is great for both men and women. The biscotti di Prato from Antonio Mattei (in a blue paper bag and check the expiry date for freshness before buying) are delicious and travel well. Pecorino di Pienza or Fiore Sardo are hard cheeses that will go through customs. I often take home a bunch of Happydent chewing gum (don’t laugh!) because those plastic and foil gum packages in the states drive me crazy. Coffee beans from Tazza d’Oro in Roma or Quarta Caffe in Lecce. And calcio team jerseys make great gifts for kids. My niece will be recieving Fiorentina this year, as purple is her favorite color.
moleskin! I have never owned one – but so many people rave, obsess over theirs that I would love one for Xmas this year.
I discovered a very interesting real italian hat maker in Florence–Del Moro Cappelli atLungarno Delle Grazie, 18N – 50122 Firenze. Her number is 055 2346523>
What a list! Thank you, you mentioned so many of my favorites! I also did not know about many others. If I could take an original fiat 500 with me, I would. Additionally where I live (Varese province, Lombardia) they make these delicious “brutti e buoni” (ugly but good) almond cookies that would also make a nice gift -a little delicate perhaps.
Hi – Great information! I would love something from Il Papiro in Florence. Their cards, paper and any of their products are just lovely.
and thanks for making me discover Brazilian Girls and more particularly Yo-Yo Ma plays Ennio Morricone
I had a running list of stuff to get (for myself and others) before I left Italy. So much of what you mentioned is on my list. We did some combination stuff. We got our Moka at Alessi. I also got a Florentine covered photo album to display all my photos from Italy.
I JUST discovered a place here in Brussels that sells the Santa Maria Novella Farmacia line! I’m sad that I didn’t get hooked on it before I left!
Unfortunately, several great things that are excellent gifts (wine, olive oil, lemoncello) are also VERY heavy to take home. People often forget that!!
What an amazing list! Thanks for all your hard work in compling it. I loved reading the list because it brought back memories of our trip on ’06. I would love many things from the list: gloves from florence, anything from the Artigianale basket, or something from the Guaranteed classics on the food list. Ah – I long to come to Italy for a visit.
I’ve only just discovered your site, but I’m living in Rome now and I love all of these suggestions! I’m a huge fan of espresso cups and coffee itself as gifts. My very favorite coffee to give (and drink) is Rome’s own Tazza d’Oro beans (I must have given away some 10 kilos of this marvelous stuff over the years, and it’s ALWAYS a hit). As for cups, I like to buy the signature cups of the local cafes, as they’re usually hard to find outside of Italy. They’re also usually rather overpriced, but I think it’s worth it. The sets I own myself are from Tazza d’Oro (of course!), Castroni, and Sant’Eustachio.
I also covet the coffee-brand cups that restaurants and bars use (Lavazza, Miani, etc.), but I believe most are provided by the coffee suppliers and therefore hard for the average person to get his or her hands on…I recall seeing some at Piazza Navona’s Christmas fair last year, though, and I’m hoping to find some this year!
All the gifts sound great. I’d opt for the honey right now. Just finished reading “One Thousand Days in Venice” and I want to drizzle some honey over cheese and have a little treat.
In the real world – Music: add Lucio Dalla & Francesco DiGregori, and of course, Claudio Baglioni for nostalgia, Antonello Venditti for contemporary Roman. Movies: Caro Diario – says alot about Italian way of life, and the Vespa shots of Garbatella and the Aventino are priceless. In the food category, chestnut flour (don’t know if that will export) so we can make today’s brownies (how’s that for combining contests?) and Gianduia!!! How can you not include that? Total guilty pleasure!
In my dreams? Definitely a Fiat 500 – my favourite car ever (I’ve had two over my lifetime); After Eight gelato from the place around the corner from the Pantheon, Rosette!!!! Why can’t we get these anywhere else in the world? And a Prosciutto crudo (the whole leg on the wooden slicing rack)……..No mom, please don’t wake me up now!!!!!!!!
I go to an Italian market in Little Italy where I purchase imported Italian olive oil. Then when I get home and enjoy dunking my Italian bread in it, I ooh and aah. A lot. I love my olive oil.
What I’d add to the list of food stuff is (what I consistently bring back) flavored oil (I love the hot pepper oil that cost about 2 euros in Roma and about $15 here…), and salt. I have my last jar of salamoia bolognese and I’m trying to recreate the herb/oil/salt proportions. Sigh.
And about the movies: The Talented Mr. Ripley is INDEED wonderful scenery, but what a creepy movie…..
The his/her moka with the small platform that holds the cups while the coffee brews directly into them.
As strange as this is going to sound, the first thing that comes to mind of what I’d want from Italy is an Italian calendar. (Probably falsely thinking it’ll help me remember the days & months without too much effort.)
Then there was this super thick hot chocolate we had when we were in Rome. It was made from a mix but I have no idea what it was, only that it was the absolute best hot chocolate I ever had.
Oh… the pandoro…. and I’d get a Bialetti Mukka, and then search for some good porcini, and espresso cups. And perhaps a chitarra for homemade pasta.
I so enjoyed reading everyone’s comments about Italy and the gastranomic delights. We have been to Italy a few times, visiting Tuscany and Rome. We are going again in April……….this time to the southern part, including Sicily.
We will be visiting family in Campania and am wondering if you can give me some suggestions as to what gifts I might bring them from the USA.
Hi, your friend Jessica recommended this site. And what a brilliant site it is. I am buying a large amount of Murano beads because I make my own jewellery but I have no idea what price I should be paying. I am also looking for Venetian masks as I collect masks. Any help would be gratefully received. Thanks
As I am heading to Italy in Oct., for the first time, this list will make my souvenir shopping list so very easy.
This is an amazing list, I have never been to Italy, but am wanting to go someday (hopefully sooner than later). I think any of the paper products or stained glass would be amazing to have. I am going to bookmark this page because of all the links! Thank you for putting this together!
There are so many amazing gifts, it is hard as a tourist to just pick a couple to take home, I usually want them all! The best gifts are the memories that you have created and then share with others.
I accidentally came across Italy Gift Guide for All-Year Long — Ms. Adventures in Italy while I was googling Atomic Kitsch looking for ideas for a new blog I am doing. I went through the whole site and then I saw the link to you from your old blog. Pretty cool stuff here. Thanks!
Wow, what a fantastic and THOROUGH list :) I also always bring back a Moka Pot and I LOVE the Alessi kitchen products! Of course, food, wine and olive oil are wonderful gifts but I’m just now starting to discover gifts beyond my stomach…
Sara, your site is superb. I have spent nearly my entire morning hopping from one post to the next in utter glee. I am moving to Northern Italy in just a few weeks, and you’ve gotten me so excited that somehow the stress of the move has melted away for the moment. Thank you so much for sharing all of your wonderful finds, and excellent insight.
Very nice list and post. If I may advise I suggest you to discover Venice and the island of Murano where you could get some nice souvenirs made by artistic glass!

If the album's first single, "Jaded," is any indication, the veteran Boston rockers have nothing to worry about. The jangly, sing-along ditty climbs nine spots to #28 on next week's Billboard Hot 100 singles chart.
Singer Steven Tyler and guitarist Joe Perry wrote and produced Just Push Play with Marti Frederiksen and Mark Hudson, marking the first time members of Aerosmith have taken control as producers.

For every TV high school hunk who's too cocky, jocky or dimwitted (or all three), we've got your antidote: Gregg Sulkin's "Faking It" character, Liam, an artist with a pure heart. When MTV's new scripted series premieres next month, Liam will make the girls swoon (Karma, in particular), but won't have to forfeit his sensitive side in the process. It's a role that perfectly suits Sulkin, who possesses the perfect mix of heartthrob and experienced thespian.
Born in London, Sulkin broke into acting at a young age, and by the time he was 14, he'd already shared the screen with the legendary Helena Bonham Carter (you might remember her as Bellatrix Lestrange from "Harry Potter"?) in "Sixty Six." Soon, he was racking up roles on shows like "As the Bell Rings" on Disney Channel UK, and proceeded to ride the Mickey Mouse wave Stateside, where he made quite a splash in "Wizards of Waverly Place."
In 2010, Sulkin took on the role of Mason Greyback, a British student who happened to be, you know, A TEEN WOLF. Mason was as thoughtful as they come and loved to paint (sounds a lot like Liam!), but also knew how to fight for his lady, Alex. Naturally, the girls ate him up, and his heartthrob reputation only continued to build with a certain ABC Family show.
In 2012, the same year he appeared on "Melissa & Joey," Sulkin nabbed the part of Wesley Fitzgerald, the younger brother of Ezra Fitz, on "Pretty Little Liars." Wesley shared a few romantic moments with main character Aria Montgomery, and Lucy Hale, the actress who plays Aria (and a proud "Punk'd" vet), surely became the envy of every viewer with a pulse.
Flash forward to 2014, and Sulkin's ready for his close-up in "Faking It," which kicks off April 22 at 10:30/9:30c. He's clearly got the chops to take on the role of the high school Renaissance Man -- just check him out in the trailer!
Kanye West and Jay-Z premiered the anticipated visuals for their "N----s In Paris" video on Thursday (February 9) and the Kanye-directed video is nothing short of visually stunning. From the kaleidoscope special effects to the concert footage and architectural imagery, it'll certainly take more than one look (and listen) to soak it all in. That said, we've grabbed a few of the best still shots from the video for your viewing pleasure. "Cray" is only the beginning, check out more photos after the jump.
Filmed in part during the run of Throne shows at the Staples Center in Los Angeles — additional footage, one can assume, was shot during a casted performance, unless the Staples crowd was 85 percent female models — the clip captures both the loose jocularity of 'Ye and Jay and the electric energy that coursed through the venue when "Paris" leapt from the speakers (many, many times). West fills the video with eye-catching kaleidoscopic effects, creating dizzying visuals that fold the audience, the stage and everything else in upon themselves, making fractals upon fractals. No wonder the clip is preceded by an epilepsy warning.
Given the size and scope of both the song and the artists performing it, the "Paris" video is also loaded with lasers, prowling panthers, pop-up-book cityscapes and the aforementioned models. Shoot, even producer Hit-Boy makes a one-second cameo. It's a head-spinning, pulse-quickening mixture of imagery and movement, of sight and sound — an experience unlike any other live clip.
Oh, and yes, Will Ferrell makes an appearance too, though it's in the form of a scene from "Blades of Glory" (guess Ferrell wasn't lying when he told MTV News that plans to feature him in the clip never quite materialized). So truly, there's something for everyone. If you caught the Throne tour, the "Paris" video is sure to inspire heady flashbacks. If you didn't, well, here's what it was like, only pushed to the absolute max. And to further replicate the live feeling, I recommend watching it for roughly the next hour. It's the way the thing was supposed to be viewed, after all.
James Corden made a soap opera using only Justin Bieber lyrics, and starring Ray Romano, Salma Hayek, and Gary Oldman.
Gary Oldman apologized on "Jimmy Kimmel Live" for his controversial and inflammatory remarks to Playboy magazine.
"Dawn of the Planet of the Apes" screened twenty minutes of footage today, and we're breaking down what it all means.
Oldman plays 'the designated leader' of a community that stumbles upon Caesar's apes, according to an interview with MTV News.
Rumors have hit the Web that the DVD will include 30 extra minutes, but director's cuts have never been Nolan's style.
'Dark Knight Rises' holds top spot for a third consecutive weekend as Colin Farrell's remake debuts with soft $26 million.
Box office analysts 'extremely doubtful' Colin Farrell's reboot will overtake 'The Dark Knight Rises' juggernaut this weekend.
From his League of Shadows graduation to a brutal battle of the wits against the Joker, here are the Caped Crusader's greatest fights under Christopher Nolan's vision.
While some fans took issue with Joseph Gordon-Levitt's big reveal, this writer wouldn't have it any other way.
Box-office analysts are predicting a second weekend of at least $60 million for the last entry in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy.

The Auto and Shop Information section of the ASVAB test measures your knowledge of automobile technology and basic repairs. The shop questions are about basic wood and metals. For example, you will encounter questions such as “Shock absorbers on a car connect the axle to the: wheel, chassis, drive shaft, or exhaust pipe?” You may be asked what sanding blocks are used for, followed by the following choices: preventing high spots and ridges on sanded surfaces, preventing dirt from collecting on the sandpaper, stretching the length of sandpaper, or prolonging the use of the sandpaper. The CAT-ASVAB test has two parts: the first part covering automotive material asks 11 questions in 7 minutes; the 11 shop information questions are allotted 6 minutes. The paper-and-pencil version asks 25 questions in 11 minutes.

​Conservation easements are legal agreements granted by landowners to land trusts in order to protect their property—forever—from inappropriate development. Land trust staff work with property owners to identify the property’s conservation values and ensure that those values are protected in accordance with the landowner’s wishes.
​Landowners grant conservation easements to preserve their land while retaining private ownership. By granting an easement, the owner is assured that the property’s conservation values are protected forever.
​Conservation easements can protect forests, wetlands, habitats along rivers and streams, farms, agricultural and timber land, scenic areas, historic sites, and more.
​Easements typically permit landowners to continue traditional uses of the land. For example, if the goal is to protect farmland, an easement may restrict subdivision and development while allowing for structures and activities necessary for agricultural operations. If the goal is to preserve a natural area, however, an easement may prohibit most activities that would alter the land’s present natural condition. In each instance, the landowner and land trust develop an easement that protects the property’s conservation values.
​Landowners choose whether to grant public access to their property. Public access is not required for easements that protect wildlife, plant habitats, or agricultural land. Easements created for recreation or educational purposes are required to provide some form of public access, such as hiking or fishing in specific locations or occasional guided tours.
​Conservation easements are permanent and binding on all future landowners. Easements are recorded with property deeds at the county records office so that all future owners are aware of the restrictions.
​Oconee River Land Trust is responsible for enforcing the easement’s provisions. To do this, we typically monitor the property once a year to ensure that there are no problems. These visits also allow us to discuss any questions or plans that the landowner might have. If the easement has been violated, we may require that it be remedied and the property restored to its prior condition.
​It begins with a phone call. Calling the staff at the Oconee River Land Trust provides the opportunity for you to tell us about your land and why you’re interested in a conservation easement. It is important to us that you view ORLT as an information resource. Based on that initial conversation, we can decide if a visit to your property is appropriate.
​The initial property visit by ORLT staff is really a continuation of your first phone call. The landowner and ORLT staff tour the property and discuss the landowner’s plans. In particular, we focus on the land’s conservation features, how the land is currently being used, future plans for the land, and any concerns the landowner may have. If, at the end of this visit, the landowner wants to continue to pursue establishing a conservation easement, we develop a project summary for approval by the Oconee River Land Trust Board of Directors.
​If the Board agrees that the project meets ORLT criteria, a formal letter is prepared that includes a summary of the proposed easement, the expected fees, and the suggested Stewardship Donation. This letter also emphasizes the importance of landowners seeking their own legal and tax advice regarding the easement.
​Project Fee: This one-time fee supports the preparation of the Baseline Documentation Report and Conservation Easement. It is based on the size and complexity of the easement.
Title Report Fee: This is the fee required for recording the conservation easement with the property deed at the county records office so that all future owners are aware of the restrictions.
Stewardship Contribution: This one-time contribution covers some of the costs of annual monitoring visits of the property, reviews of construction and other plans for improvements, reviews of farm and forestry management plans, and any legal defense of easement provisions.
In addition, landowners may need to obtain property surveys prior to establishing a conservation easement, and those who are seeking tax deductions must obtain a “qualified appraisal.”
​We recognize that establishing a conservation easement is a significant decision. With that in mind, ORLT staff maintain an ongoing dialogue to answer any concerns. We respect the landowner’s right to halt the process at any time prior to the easement being signed.

Millions across the world face the daily challenge to find enough food to survive. Hunger is on the rise globally with more than 1.2 billion people suffering from food insecurity. Rising prices are further restricting food access.In this deeply informative study, Majda Bne Saad identifies the causes for global hunger embedded in the current global political and economic system and highlights the key challenges facing low income food deficit countries. She shows how Western countries share the blame for global hunger through their support for subsidies to agricultural production and biofuels, which have created new challenges to food security worldwide. Bne Saad argues that, as world population rises from 6.7 billion to 9.2 billion by 2050, there needs to be a "second green revolution" to grow more food. She looks at the factors constraining low-income nations from achieving food security and considers policies which could generate income and enhance individual entitlement to food.
Written by award-winning documentarian Miller, this book focuses on the real meaning of carbon trading, and looks at the zero-sum formula where the amount of carbon-based pollution is not being reduced--only moved by brokers among countries. More Info

Bob has been painting since he received a Christmas gift - an oil painting set at the age of 12. Immediately he was captivated by what could be achieved with a brush, some oil paint and a few small squares of hardboard; he used to paint on the reverse side because he thought it looked like proper canvas. Childhood memories of the mill his mother worked at as a weaver form the images he paints now; Bob loved the smell of the looms at the mill, talked to everybody in the spinning sheds, the burling and mending room, the winders and tuners, along with his grandmother who was the ‘cha’ lady there. With no formal training Bob has enjoyed painting in many different styles and with numerous subjects, developing and honing his techniques of brush and palette knife. Although a Yorkshire man born and bred, during his youth Bob spent time in Cornwall. There he met two prominent artists (Keith English & Tom Gower) and spent hours watching them paint. Conversations with them made him believe he could be a professional artist. However, as life went on, marriage, children and a mortgage meant that painting remained as a hobby whilst Bob ran his own video and media company. His daughter-in-law now runs the business, allowing Bob to achieve his lifelong dream of being a working artist. “Nostalgia spurs me to paint by looking back to childhood memories with adult eyes; this allows me to be quite free artistically” bob [B.1954, Yorkshire] barker

Remembering stuff is hard. It's one thing to forget birthdays, anniversaries, and deadlines; those things don't really matter. What sucks is not being able to remember the names of all of the new Blazers this year. Six players on the Blazers 15 man roster are new to the team. Add in Nate and Dean Demopoulos (interesting side note: Theo Ratliff is from Demopolis AL. That's like, almost the same!), and you've got seven new names that you have to commit to memory, at least until the trade deadline, at which time you'll (hopefully) have to learn more. Weak minded people like myself who have committed the first 5 seasons of "Beverly Hills 90210" to memory have a hard time retaining new information. So, as a services to those trying their best to be superfans without forgetting what Donna's birthday is (Christmas!) or the vanity plate on Steve's Corvette ("I8A4RE" as in "I ate a Ferrari"), I submit a list of nicknames with the hope that you won't forget who's name to get tattooed on your chest come playoff time.
Charles Smith: 6-4, 200 lbs. guard out of New Mexico ("There's a New Mexico?"). To be fair, this isn't Charles first stint with the Blazers, though it would be understandable if you forgot his 3 game tenure with the team during the 2002-03 season (which also happens to be the last year the Blazers made the playoffs. Coincidence?). Unfortunately, Charlie's parents didn't give us a lot to work with from the nickname standpoint. Charles Smith is about as boring as you can get, and as of yet, Charley hasn't really shown me much to differentiate him from the thousands of other Charles Smith's out there. "Charles in Charge" would be a good one if he were a point guard, or actually in charge, but for our purposes, it doesn't really fly. Charlie "Brown" Smith would probably be considered racist by most, though if Nate keeps pulling PT away from Charles like Lucy pulls footballs from Charlie, then this one might stick. Basically, I got no good names for Charles. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Steve Blake: 6-3, 172 lbs. (soaking wet) guard out of Maryland. Steve is one small guy. Being over six foot and under 180 pounds makes you an ideal Kenyan marathon runner, but not much of a PG. I still haven't figured out why management picked this guy up, but as long as he's here, we might as well give him a term of endearment. My nickname for Steve is "The Snowflake," because he's soft, white, melts under any kind of pressure, and is usually welcomed when it first shows up, but then becomes a nuisance come February. Besides, Steve "The Snowflake" Blake would sound great booming out of the loudspeakers at the Rose Garden.
Juan Dixon: 6-3, 164 lbs. guard out of Maryland. Man, if you're over six foot and have any semblance of a 3-point shot, you should call John Nash and see if he's in the market for another guard, because he obviously can't get enough undersized, no-D playing Maryland guys. Once again, I'm not sure exactly why Juan was brought in. I realized that the Blazers are super thin at SG, but come on, Juan ain't the answer! Due to this, I am set on the nickname "A Million to" Juan Dixon, taking into account that P.Allen is paying him around 2.5 million a year for god knows what, which is much like the premise of the Paul Rodriguez blockbuster "A Million to Juan."
Sergei Monia: 6-8, 220 lbs (or 98.8 kilos back in Mother Russia) out of CSKA Moscow, which, for those of you who don't know, has been a long time CIA front. Does anyone out there know if Sergei's last name is "Monia" or "Monya"? The Blazer roster has him down as "Monia", but other places on the web have it as "Monya." I've put a call into the Blazer front office regarding this discrepancy. I'm sure someone will be getting right back to me (Update: some guy named Chuck called me back and informed me that, for pronunciation reasons, the "y" in "Sergey" and "Monya" has been changed to an "i" in both instances. Who says the Blazers aren't fan friendly). While I'm waiting for conformation on his "Christian" name, I'll return to the task at hand; Sergei's nickname. As previously stated, our swing guard of the future shall be known henceforth as Sergei "Pneu" Monia. He's just that sick. And to loosely quote Run-DMC, "Not sick meaning bad but sick meaning good!"
Jarrett Jack: 6-3, 202 lbs. guard out of Georgia Tech. I love me some Jarrett Jack. After years of undersized PG's, it's nice to finally have someone that can body up on some of the stronger guards in the league. And a guy that's played 3 years of ACC ball might as well be a veteran on this team of Europeans and youngins. But what name embodies the kind of rough-neck attitude that Jarrett brings to the court? Jarrett "Big" Jack "Attack"? Jarrett Jack "In the Box"? Jarrett Jack "In the Saddle Again"? Jarrett Jack "Booted Thug"? I think I'll stick with that one.
Martell Webster: 6-7, 210 lbs. guard/forward out of Seattle Prep High School. Finally, the draft pick. I love Martell for two important reasons: First, he' going to be a great player for the Blazers, and second, his being drafted snatched him from the clutches of Lorenzo Romar at University of Washington. Take that you filthy dawgs. Being a quite, soft-spoken kind of guy, Martell is deserving of a name a little softer around the edges. I've come up with two: Martell "Charlotte's" Webster (he's terrific, and humble) or Martell "Staring Emanuel Lewis As" Webster.
So there you have it. Once again, I'd love to hear any other suggestions. And coming soon, new nicknames for your favorite returning players!
Any nicknames for Ha or Kryapa? I know they are not new players but still deserve a nickname. I've heard of ones like Godzill-Ha or Viktor-y Khryapa.
Ah blazer4ever, I'm glad you asked. As far as Ha Seung-Jin goes, I've given him the nickname Ha "The Seoul Man" Seung-Jin, considering Ha's Korean ethnicity. Viktor-y Khryapa ain't bad, though I've been going with Viktor "Wholly" Khryapa, only because Viktor "the Kobe Stoppa" Khryapa has already been taken.
Charles "Who?" Smith. Stolen from average name (and talent) rapper Mike Jones and fitting when you are figuring out the guys at the end of the bench.
Godzill-Ha will be shot down by Przybilla fans, but I think a more fitting name is "Ha-teh". Ok, maybe that doesn't read like I want it to, but just add the sound of the letter T after Ha to make him Hot.
Being a fan of the Wu I like Ghostface 'Billah as well. How about Ol' Dirty Pryzbastard? Or the PryzRza?
Thanks Anon! I love getting feedback, even feedback as well thought-out as yours. In all seriousness, I want Juan to do well. You have to admit that the looked horrible in the first 4 games. I will gladly worship at the altar of Juan if he can manage to play at least 2 decent games before going on a 4 game bender of ill-advised shots.
There's two games in a row, hope you enjoyed last night's win as much as I did. And sorry the last post wasn't as "well-thought out" as your clever witticisms above. I mean Sergei "Pneu" Monia? I really can't stop laughing. You ought to be writing comedies in Hollywood. But seriously, glad you're ready to welcome "Don Juan" into the fold now that he's strung a couple of solid games together.
Give me your address anon and I'll send you a couple treatments and a manuscript. I'd much rather be writing comedy in Branson, but if you've got the Hollywood connections, I'd disreagard my artistic integrity, but just this once. Go Blazers go!
Hi, I was out blogging and found your site. It certainly got my attention and interest. I was looking for Lures information and even though this isn't a perfect match I enjoyed your site. Thanks for the read!
Wow. Think about this. If Martell hits a game winning three with .1 second left, imagine the announcer saying "Oh my goodness! Martell "Charlotte's" Webster drains a trey to win the game!" Yeah. Thats sounds retarded.
Watch subject. Bush is forever saying that democracies do not invade other countries and start wars. Well, he did just that. He invaded Iraq, started a war, and killed people. What do you think? Is killing thousands of innocent civilians okay when you are doing a little government makeover?
We have lost friends and influenced no one. No wonder most of the world thinks we suck. Thanks to what george bush has done to our country during the past three years, we do!
Blender News--Feature Articles - 'Seahorse in Corals' by Nika Maisuradze - the Winner of the Week of July 23, 2018
It's amazing how much you can replicate what you see in nature in Blender, especially things like frost on trees, algae on rocks, and this time a small sea creature. Another Blender master is back with his replication of nature. Check out the work of this week's winner.
How, then, can you too qualify for this award? Please have in mind that this award is reserved for those that are on par with or that excel top-notch works published by artists and studios. If such work does not appear during a given week, this award is not being given to anyone. So please submit your best work to www.blenderartist.org or to the Member's Gallery of this site, or Contact Us to show where your work is available on the internet. It doesn't have to be a Blender render, internal or Cycles. Any other render engine is fine as long as Blender was used as a part of your workflow.
So, it is with great pleasure that www.BlenderNews.org introduces to you the winner of the Render of the Week Award for the week of July 23, 2018: Nika Maisuradze.
The original version of this seahorse was developed for another project, but there it ended up being in the background, so I decided to rework it, add more details and release as a separate project. The first version was just seahorse with a simple environment, later I thought it could use at least little more complex environment than a just plain blurred image, so I added some corals and ended up reworking whole scene lighting/shading setup. It was extremely interesting working on this. I was always wondering if I could capture that macro sea life look. At least partially I think I managed to do it. This gave me so much creative impulse that I think my next few projects will be on underwater sea life.

Yet another tech geek weblog with a focus on technical Linux and open source, particularly server-side, on Java EE, PostgreSQL, and more.
I've started playing with some basic tutorial/toy electronics stuff using the Arduino platform and the "SparkFun Arduino Inventors' Kit" (hardly "inventors'", but anyway...) after picking it up as part of an order from the awesome outfit Little Bird Electronics. While generally good, I've hit an interesting issue with the kit that's worth documenting for anyone else who has it.
The short version: If you're using the SparkFun kit that specifies a 10kΩ resistor and the test circuit doesn't work (the motor won't spin) you might need to use a lower valued resistor between the transistor and pin 9 of the Arduino board.
If this is the case, you'll find that when you flick the motor's drive around with your fingers so it spins, sometimes it'll spin down slowly and sometimes it'll stop suddenly, depending on whether the Arduino is currently trying to drive it or not.
Check for all the usual errors before assuming the issue described here is what's wrong with your circuit. You might've reversed the flyback diode, made a poor connection on a power rail, etc etc.
The SparkFun kit for CIRC-03 ("Spin Motor Spin - Transitor & Motor") is based on Ardx CIRC03 but it has one difference that looks like it may be a significant error.
The SparkFun instructions specify a 10kΩ resistor but, at least with the motor supplied in my kit, the test circuit won't actually work with that much resistance between the P2N2222AG (actually marked P2N222A18 in my kit) transistor's base pin and pin 9 of the Arduino Uno board. Replacing the 10kΩ resistor with a 2.2kΩ resistor - like that specified by the ardx instructions - fixes the problem, allowing the transistor to pass enough current to let the motor spin.
A quick read suggests that P2N2222AG and P2N222218 are functionally equivalent, with different date codes or serial numbers, so that shouldn't be the cause of the issue.
If you bought the kit and don't do any other electronics stuff you may not have a 2.2kΩ (red-red-red) resistor or anything vaguely similar lying around. If so, you can always connect up 6 (or so) of the 330Ω resistors supplied in the kit in series to achieve roughly the same resistance. Or you can wind four 10kΩ resistors in parallel, which might be easier.
Remember that to get them connected in series you must put the input of one and the output of another alone on a breadboard row. Connecting five or six of them will give you a sort of stair-step or saw-tooth pattern where you have resistors connecting, say, F14-G13, F13-G12, F12-G11, F11-G10, F10-G9 and F9-G8. You can then plug the lead from the transistor base pin into F8 and the lead from Arduino pin 9 into the other end of the resistor series at G14. If your resistors have long leads and you don't want to clip them you have to space everything out a bit more than this to avoid shorts across all those resistor wires; this is just an example of how it can work.
To make sure my motor wasn't just defective I bridged it across the +5V and -GND rails. This probably wasn't a smart thing to do without a resistor in series with the motor; I got away with it, but you might not.
Update 2012:: Note that I put the motor between the +5V supply rail and GND, not between a digital output pin and GND. The latter might fry your Arduino, don't do it. The Arduino has USB over-current protection, but it doesn't have any over-current protection on the digital output pins.
I got it working because I found your page. I spent about 3 hours trying to figure out why it's not working; all the time thinking that I must have wired something wrong somewhere.
Same here - cheers. I'll see what I've got lying around, but I doubt I've got anything similar in the box.
This page was just the right answer for me too. I had a 2.2k in my collection of stuff and still had to manually spin-start the motor. The other two programs won't run well with a manual start on the motor, though. Perhaps I have a minimally defective motor, but I can live with that for the purposes of this experiment/lesson.
Many thanks Craig - that substitution fixed it for me too. (Well, actually I linked 7 x 330ohm resitors in series to make an equivalent of 2.31k ohms, since that's all I had available in my kit, between the transistor and pin 9 of the Arduino board. CIRC 03 worked perfectly with this).
Thanks for this. I spent about 30 minutes on it and hopped on google - found your page. Good one. I'll have a crack at it tomorrow.
I tried with two 10k resistors in parallel, and it worked a little better, although I had to spin it manually in the beginning. I noticed, however, the transistor got quite hot. Won't hooking it up directly to the Arduino pin fry the transistor?
I don't understand why you fear hooking the base pin of a BJT transistor up to an Arduino pin risks frying the transistor. An Arduino digital pin on high can drive about 50mA (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno) at 5V. That as a base->emitter current on a BJT NPN transistor isn't going to hurt it. You're not going to get close to that level of current with 5k of resistance as in your circuit, or 2.2k as called for in CIRC-03, in the +5V-resistor-base-emitter-ground path anyway. Assuming ideal zero resistance from the transistor, Ohm's law says you'll draw:
Because the base->emitter current is amplified on the corresponding collector -> emitter current, a suitable collector -> emitter load could certainly overheat and kill the transistor. I'd be surprised if the motor drew enough, though.
My poor understanding says that a MOSFET would be a better choice here than a BJT anyway. This application is switching "on" or "off" with nothing in between, which is ideal for a MOSEFT and will cause the MOSEFT to operate at its ideals, not in its inefficient partially-on zone. I suspect they've used a BJT because they're cheap (not that MOSFETs aren't) and they didn't want to add more parts or muddle beginners. I know it would've muddled me plenty when I did those kits.
Thanks for the explanation. What I'm worried is the collector -> emitter current. Since there will be no resistance to limit the base current, I'm wondering if the transistor won't allow to much current to flow from the engine and fry itself (since it was already hot with using 5k on the base). Or worse, fry the arduino by drawing too much power from the pin (I don't know how well protected the arduino is). I don't mind killing the transistor, since they are really cheap, but frying the arduino would be worse. :)
The ardiuno is safe; even a 330 resistor in the +5V -> GND path is enough to prevent overcurrent with Arduino's 50mA-per-pin limit. Again, ohm's law to find the resistance needed to limit a +5V potential to 50mA:
You need 100Ω of resistance to protect against over-current from an Arduino pin to ground in a simple resistive circuit. You've got 5000Ω in that path, you have 50 times the resistance required.
As for excess current on the transistor's C->E junction: DC motors aren't a resistive load, they're an inductive load (mostly). Their resistance isn't particularly high, but current is still limited by the inductive/magnetic properties of the motor. There isn't any resistance (theoretically) in the [+] -> [collector->emitter] -> motor -> GND path, but current is still limited by the motor, just not resistively. In practice of course the wires, the transistor, and the motor all add a small amount of resistance too - try measuring it.
A bit of reading suggests that the motor's worst case is when stalled, as it's then pretty much just a resistive load, and not much of one. Your transistor is probably getting too hot because your motor isn't going fast enough, strangely enough.
"In the absolute worst case (stall) then, yeah, it appears as a resistive load since the inductance will allow the DC current flow through a single winding to eventually reach a level where the current is now limited by the resistance and thus no longer rises meaning the inductance then appears as a short"
When the motor is not acting as an inductive load, you have a [+] -> transistor -> motor -> GND circuit where current is only limited by the other resistance on the circuit - the transistor. The transistor will be dissipating the power from the current through it multiplied by the full 5V potential difference. It'll get quite hot, depending on how much C-E current the B-E current is allowing to flow and what the intrinsic resistance on the transistor and stalled motor are. I don't know BJT transistor physics well enough to work the numbers out or give a good explanation, I'm afraid.
What it boils down to - from my limited understanding - is that you'll be fine if the motor is actually running, but could over-current and overheat the motor + transistor if the motor is overloaded or underpowered and stalls.
You don't really want a resistor in the [+] -> [C->E] -> motor -> GND path, as it'll just waste power. I'm not sure what the best way to prevent overcurrent in that circuit without wasting power is; it's a bit puny for a fuse. Wikipedia knows though: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_limiting
OK, did a little looking around. If you want to limit the +5V -> [C->E] -> motor -> GND current without adding too much unnecessary resistance, you can use a PTC / PPTC. It'll still introduce some resistance (and thus power loss) in normal operation, but protects against shorts and overcurrent.
You can use these in series on your Arduino pins if you're worried about overcurrent damage, and a bigger one on your +5V rail if you're not able to rely on the Arduino's built-in overcurrent protection (say if you're driving the Arduino via the VIN pin or DC connector instead of via USB).
Thank you so much for posting this! Like most people, I assumed the problem was with how I wired the circuit, so I sat there for an hour or two beating my head against a brick wall trying to figure out what was happening!
The thought had occurred to me that the transistor might not be getting enough bias voltage/current, so I divided the 10k resistance in half by adding another one in parallel, but that had no effect in my case. Thing is, I pulled out a voltmeter and noticed that when the transistor was supposed to be open, the voltage drop across it (emitter - collector) was still something like 4.7V. That's when I started searching for others who might have the same issue...
Same problem here...spent the last 30 min wondering what I had done wrong, de-wired, re-wired...check diagram etc...

What is the added value and impact of participating in a COST Action? Examples of experience and best practice from COST Actions’ representative
4closurefraud.org has compiled an interesting list of the “Cost of doing business” in the fraudulent corrupt world of falsely securitized loans. To date, according to this list Chase has paid $33,318,000.50. And they are considered to be a strong bank because they have, so far, gotten away with financial murder. But as the new film, “The Big Short” will show, fraud “Always goes south.”
The big question is when people actually come to understand that there was no loan what will happen? It wasn’t a gift and it wasn’t loan, so what is it? The fact is that the banks stole investors money and then put some of it use for the benefit of the banks and not the investors. They trapped investors into deals they never wanted and did the same to borrowers. The rest of the money they kept as “trading profits.”
If the banks were to prevail the new law would be that you can steal money, make a deal, and enforce it against both the person from whom you stole the money and the person who thought they were getting a loan when in fact they were being used as a pawn in fraudulent scheme to steal the identity of the borrowers. What a ride!
And the next question is how much should be awarded as a punitive damage award? $33 Billion has not been enough to even make Chase blink.

“For God so loved the world…” Those words from St. John’s letter remind us of a core truth of our faith – God loves us and wants us to be joy-filled. The sacraments are a visible reality of that truth. Through the seven sacraments God shares his holiness with us so that we, in turn, can make the world holier.
Bishop Matano, in his letter of introduction to the Policies for the Administration of the Sacraments reminds us:
How difficult it would be to try to “get it alone” – to make sense of the life “on our own.” But the Christ of the Sacraments has not left us orphans; he has called us by name. Our Lord has extended the invitation: “Come to me all you who find life burdensome, and I will refresh your souls!” Recalling the motto of both Saint Francis de Sales and the Blessed John Henry Cardinal Newman, “Cor ad cor loquitur”, “The heart speaks to the heart,” let us respond to Christ’s invitation and open our hearts to Him present in the Sacraments, Christ’s gifts eternal, the gifts of life, the supreme gift of the Most Holy Eucharist.

The Paragraph Comprehension section of the test measures your ability to read a passage and interpret the information contained within it. You may read a selection and be asked to interpret the author’s purpose, or what a particular word in the passage means, based on the context of the sentence where it appears. To help you better prepare for the exam, the Paragraph Comprehension section of the ASVAB practice test has passages of similar length and style to those on the actual ASVAB test. The CAT-ASVAB test has 11 questions in 22 minutes; the paper-and-pencil version has 15 questions in 13 minutes.
The content of the test has been clearly laid out, but there is still a ton of information concerning the actual place where the test is administered and the time that is allocated for each section. The computerized test is administered in a “military entrance processing station” (MEP) or a satellite region that is identified as a “military entrance tests site” (MET). The difference in the two locations is that the METs are the places that are responsible for administering the written test, while MEPs are the places that administer the computerized tests.

Jättedam spelar musik utifrån många influenser och beskrivs ibland som nyprogg och ibland som progressiv rock med popmelodier och psykedeliska inslag. Det är ett levande band i ständig förändring och ett liveframträdande är sällan det andra likt. För det mesta kommer musiken till dem genom många timmars jamsessioner. Det börjar vanligtvis i ett groove eller melodi, där jammen kanske stapplar fram på lite småfunkiga barnsben, för att sedan kliva in i en rocknroll-präglad psykedelisk pubertet och sedan förhoppningsvis mogna till något coolt. Helst ska musiken framkalla en ström av känslor som drar för verklighetens gardiner och lyser upp ens inre skrymslen. Det är svårt att säkerställa någon självklar estetisk vision av musiken då den är ständigt flyende och svår att naila ned på kanvas, men förhoppningsvis lämnar den någon form av unik bild inbränd på lyssnarens hornhinna.

Maria Ward Schule Bad Homburg | Realschule und berufliches Gymnasium für Mädchen in freier Trägerschaft -
When was the last time you took the short little drive from Rossmoor to the Orinda Library and Community Center Starlight Amphitheater? I’ve reported several times in recent months that the Orinda Starlight Theater Players shows are getting better and better and are perhaps one of the best theatre values on this side of the Orinda Hills. I have been told that a number of Rossmoorians came to their production of “Comedy of Errors” recently and came away quite pleased (as I said they would). The current production of Noel Coward’s 1922 comedy, Fallen Angels, is delightfully funny and especially worthy of your attendance at this time.
Under the sage advice and artful direction of Charlotte Meyer, the stalwart cast (consisting of several repeat performers) has delivered a truly delightful and highly entertaining production under the stars in this old amphitheater in the Orinda Hills.
The story evolves around two middle aged attractive women (who have been friends since childhood) and who have married well and are ensconced comfortably in moderately well-to-do upperclass British society. Julia Sterroll (played by Susan England) and Jane Banbury (played by Lori Wolford) are constant companions, sharing life’s trials and tribulations and peripheral rewards. Their husbands, Fred Sterroll (Bill Chessman) and Willy Banbury (Ken Sollazzo), likewise, are good friends and golfing buddies as well.
As the show opens, Fred and Julia are becoming introduced to the Sterroll’s new maid who shall be known as Saunders (played by Jill Gelster). It seems that she knows a little bit about everything, has done everything, is a name-dropper par excellance and is always right!
Shortly after they leave, Jane bursts into Julia’s home extremely upset, excited, and confused. She wants Julia to pack a bag and retreat with her from their homesteads for the hinterlands of London, to avoid an encounter with a Frenchman with whom they have both had an encounter of the “most intimate” kind, in the years just prior to their current marriages. Certain that meeting up with their dashing, daring, and highly sexual former French paramour, Maurice Duclos (Geotty Chapple), will have potentially disastrous consequences on their present marriages and future libido levels, the two ladies fly and flutter, curse and caterwaul, trying to make up their minds what to do and where to go.
Shall they escape and leave a letter for the Frenchman that they have been called away, or shall they bear the cross of potential licentious behavior and stay! How convenient that their husbands are away for the evening (predictable a very long evening) when the Frenchman is anticipated. What a predicament - - What fun!
The acting is very good for cast, ranging from amateur to quasi-professional actors. While everyone is fun, the three ladies, Susan, Lori, and Jill are an absolute delight!
For those of you who came to see the previous production of “Tempest” will be probably be interested to see the new production of "Comedy of Errors" by William Shakespeare which will open on September 8th and run through September 30th.
The Orinda Starlight Village Players Theatre (OrSVP) is located at 26 Orinda Way, in the Orinda Amphitheatre adjacent to the Orinda Community Center, Park and new Library, on the Orinda Village side of town. OrSVP is local community theatre that has served Orinda and surrounding communities for approximately 30 years. Tickets are a very reasonable $15 for Fallen Angels, with discounts available for seniors and students. Performances are every Friday and Saturday evening at 8:30 p.m., and tickets may be purchased at the entrance to the amphitheater. The play continues through Saturday, August 19th. You may call (925) 253-1191 for additional information. Reservations are not necessary and seating is on a first come, first serve basis. There is plenty of parking adjacent to the park and community center. Remember to dress comfortably and bring a “Tush Cushion” or a folding picnic chair, as the natural rock seating is not the most comfortable.
Meanwhile over the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, I had the extreme good fortune to catch the Lamplighter’s production of Gilbert and Sullivan’s comic operetta, “The Witch’s Curse” (also known as Ruddygore), in the Yerba Buena Center. This superb production will be opening in the Dean Lesher Regional Center for the Arts in Walnut Creek on August 3rd for a three day run.
The story is basically a moral opera in which honor and moral absolutes are turned up-side down. Baron Sir Rutheven Mergatroyd fakes his death and changes his name to Robin Oakapple in order to protect himself from a curse inflicted by a witch many generations earlier in his family history. The curse inflicts unimaginable pain and suffering on the oldest living male member of the Mergatroyd family if they do not commit a crime every day of their life. By disappearing into a little local village where he is only known as the very handsome but painfully shy farmer, Robin, this Mergatroyd from Ruddygore has successfully passed the curse on to his next younger brother, Despard.
As time passes, Robin falls in love with the beautiful and petite Rose Maybud (played by two different actresses, Elena Krell and Karen Tesitor), as does his younger foster-brother, Richard Dauntless (John Brown), a seafarer, come home from the sea. A battle ensues over which of the three men (Robin, Despard and Richard) shall finally win the hand of the lovely Rose Maybud.
Two other characters just about steal the show, Mad Margaret played by Kathleen Moss and Sir Despard Mergatroyd of Ruddygore, played by Charles Martin. This is a huge cast that brings out a truly great production in this Gilbert and Sullivan musical.
This nineteenth century musical melodrama is full of silliness and whimsy, including a troupe of professional bridesmaids who bemoan the fact that until the prettiest girl in town, Rose Maybud, marries, no one else will marry either. From Bad Baronets to a bevy of beautiful bride’s maids, the story is guaranteed to make you laugh and come away with a good feeling.
The operatic voices are absolutely exquisite, the orchestra brilliant and the sets outrageous. In addition, this time they have added “Super Titles” projected on a small screen above the stage where they project the words to the songs. Sometimes the rapid alliteration typical of Gilbert and Sullivan are hard to follow, this makes it much easier.
Altogether this is a terrific musical experience and one that should not be missed. This madcap musical melodrama delights audiences proving that we still enjoy, perhaps even crave, comic relief.
Call the Dean Lesher Regional Center for the Arts at (925) 943-7469 (SHOW) or visit www.lamplighters.org for ticket and reservation information. This show plays August 3rd, 4th and 5th at 8 p.m., with a performance on August 5th at 2 p.m.. The tickets range in price between $11 and $46, The Dean Lesher Regional Center for the Arts is located at 1601 Civic Drive in Walnut Creek.

arrived in Borneo to find the guys waiting for me at the airport, they came in from Singapore, me from UAE through Bangkok. The guys had hired a car, and declared me designated driver mainly due to my previous proclomations of my international driving prowess. Drove to hotel number one for our stay, met a few of the others attending the wedding, enjoyed one too many cocktails, and then came back to my little suite, and played pictionary (as most of you know my favourite party game), now introduced to many over the world, and no excuse not to play since the discovery of the pictionary app one night at Cimmaron, now makes this available whenever and wherever...
There were the usual arguments about who was going to partner who, and Max and I ended up joining forces, and dare I say, may come close to being declared my perfect pictionary partner, he does have close competition from two beautiful souls.
With a wedding a day ahead, we then started sharing stories about how we all know the bride and groom and how we all came to be in Borneo together to celebrate the guys.. 'when worlds collide'
I met (Z) many years ago sitting in Richmond Green London, it was a beautiful day, I had just been to see a play at the Richmond Theatre, The 39 Steps, that had been adapted into a glorious musical, just at that Theatre. (Z) had just arrived and was working for a company in Richmond, doing a job she hated, until she could find one she loved. I was staying in Sth Ken with Mon, it was my first two weeks in London, I fell in love with that play, and with Richmond, and decided to explore it further, I knew that day, that I would live in Richmond one day, (note here Richmond UK and Richmond Australia very very different). I bought some lunch and headed to the green, (a prawn roll, funny how I remember that so vividly now) and sat on the grass in the sun, as it happened right next to (Z), and we got chatting. She was from Sth Africa, missing her boyfriend who was due to join her in 6 months, was not enjoying London, felt it was grey, hated her job. I told her to quit, what she was doing she could do something more she enjoyed for the same money, we just connected, swapped details and that weekend, I hired a car and took her out of London, I had no idea where would go, I just decided to drive (a friend had once said to me, if you don't know where you are going just keep turning left) so I did, we drove to Bath, to Poole, through the New Forest one of the most magical places in the world (New Forest) ... we stopped just turning left at some point... as we had to go back to London. I was also feeling a bit grey, at that time, and that weekend meant so much ... we have been friends since ....
She moved back to Sth Africa a few years later, no longer with her boyfriend of the time, and I was lucky enough to work for a company in the UK that had a parent company in Sth Africa, the connections of which and my visits as a result, introduced me to many people, and after many steps ended up introducing (Z) to her now husband, and also ended up connecting me, so deeply to Singapore....
we all woke the next day, late and all very very hungover, with the wedding in a few hours, at the most amazing place ... Borneo wedding venue
we arrived and went diving, now .. as you know, I love water at the best of times, even more on a hangover, this was not good ... and many of us had repercussions .... on the boat and back on shore, despite that, we all decided to have cocktails before the ceremony ... mmmmm ... (Z) now a bit drunk leans over and shares that can't be arsed to 'look pretty just for everyone else' ... so I say, don't, it is your day, do what you want .... so 45 mins later, they were married, her hair wet, no makeup, no shoes, gorgeous dress, and she could not have looked more beautiful.
an amazing evening, in an amazing place with people from different worlds connecting .... and even reconnecting .... to what individually matters .... an electrical storm ended the night, with the biggest down pour .... and guess what ... my favourite thing ... thunder, dancing lightning, and dancing in the rain ... Max did me proud x
after me screwing my flights, saint max took control, and rearranged me to Bali via Sinkers.... thank goodness, saved hours ... arrived late to hotel, airport transfer not there, found alternate ... oh my days ... not what I thought ... so, I checked out and spent an hour or so having a meal and finding a new place to stay ...
I also spent the time, tracking down my favourite person in Bali, that I have not seen 4 years, for those that know Bali, you will know how connected it is ... so after contact with some old italian friends, who got in contact with french friends, who got in contact with Irish friends ... Made was found ....
I am now sitting in my Bali Villa, and move tomorrow to a new one, where I get to spend a few days with people I adore, (remember girlfriends, are sisters you choose), tomorrow I get to see one of my sisters.
I have just spent the last 4 hours, thinking about the relationships I have, those I have been lucky enough to meet, those who touched my core, made a difference, those that matter, through worlds colliding ... I am so bloody lucky .....
BTW - I did that, in my little private pool, completely naked except for the frangipanis in my hair ... (sorry for visuals, tres liberating) .. beauty in simplicity - frangipani from my hair ... Only in Bali ....

Recently, Mayor Bowser unveiled proposals to make our roads safer for drivers, cyclists, and pedestrians. These include banning right turn on red at 100 locations, enhancing protections around school zones and intersections near bike lanes, and stiffer penalties for dangerous driving behavior.
As part of the District’s Vision Zero strategy, DFHV Vehicle Inspection Officers (VIOs) will continue outreach and enforcement of bike lane violations and unsafe driving maneuvers by Uber, Lyft, Via, taxi, and limo drivers.
To help with road safety we ask that you tweet or email pictures or videos of alleged violations. If you see something say something – VIOs patrol 24/7 to help reduce traffic-related accidents and fatalities.
Bird, the scooter start-up that became a Silicon Valley unicorn seemingly overnight, wants to chip in to fund bike lanes in cities.
Patrick Sisson at Curbed reports that the company has pledged to contribute $1 per scooter per day into a fund that will pay for projects that carve out street space where its users can ride without getting intimidated by drivers or aggravating people on sidewalks. The company urged other scooter and bike-share firms to do the same.
Bird will also convene a “Global Safety Advisory Board” led by David Strickland, the former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and currently a major lobbyist for the self-driving car industry. The advisory board will make safety recommendations addressing walking and biking as well as scooters, Sisson reports.

It has been over 6 months now that we are living in Clara. We have made it thru high winds, snow, ice and cold weather with nary an issue. Early on in winter we had several freezes in the pipes because of the cold. I installed a $12 space heater with thermostat in the bay and now anytime it gets to below 50 degrees the heater kicks on and keeps the pipes warm. This idea was one we got from a blog post we found somewhere. Works well.
The other issue keeping us in the park was that on New Years DAy evening Mrs T was having issues breathing while she fought the dreaded cold flu and Pneumonia. 3 days later she was released from the hospital with a diagnosis of exasurbated COPD. NOw we have an oxygen concentrator in the RV and portable tanks inhalors for when she goes outside. This doesnt occur very often as the cold air does not agree with her very well.
But alas the fireplace and a couple of space heaters along with blankets on the windows help keep the RV toasty. Mrs T is frustrated but content and is enjoying the video games videos and sewing in oher home. We even rigged the shower for her so she does not have to go to the community showers. Anything for Mrs T.
Ideas are being kicked around for some spring and summer travel. The son has gotten a job and the daughter in law is on a career path at the nursing home. They too are adjusting.
After many years of residential living in a large space I am enjoying the RV life. Maintenance issues are small and relatively inexpensive when they do occur.
I know its been a while but fall and winter are a busy time for me at work so not much free time to enjoy the writing of this blog. The heart surgery seems to be holding even as my cheating has increased. I again smoke my pipe away from the home and eat foods I prob shouldnt but as I have always said "Everything in moderation".
Summary: D D Kosambi profoundly redefined the message that Marxism had for historians. What set him apart from others who “applied” Marxism to Indian history was his determination to maintain, indeed increase the standard of rigour in his factual and textual research, for Marxism dealt with a far more extensive area than the one over which research had conventionally been conducted. Guided by the basic thesis about how social evolution occurs, he rejected the view that India had ever passed through a phase of slavery; rather it was the construction of caste society that happened here. The reasons for his acceptance of a stage of feudalism spanning the period from that of the Guptas to the Mughals are most interesting.
It was a happy day for Indian historiography when D D Kosambi began to take interest in the interpretation of the past of Indian society, doubtless at the expense of his studies in Mathematics, the field where he had already earned so much distinction. This shift of interest was probably not unconnected with Kosambi’s own growing sympathies with Marxism. The collection of Kosambi’s articles on history, which Brajdulal Chattopadhyaya has assembled with so much labour, contains one published as early as 1938-39, in which Kosambi cites Marx and calls attention to his articles on India, to which he had apparently gained access through a publication by the Socialist Book Club, Allahabad.1 He was later to express the grouse that the editors of this volume did not tell the reader of Marx and Engels’ writings on primitive societies.2 After Hitler’s attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, communist literature began to be widely available in India. Kosambi himself now contributed a paper to the American Marxist journal, Science and Society, as early as 1944, on the issue of caste.3 He was apparently greatly affected by the famous passage in Marx’s Preface to his Critique of Political Economy, where Marx concisely enunciates his thesis that historical changes are brought about by the growth of contradictions in each “mode of production”, and explains how man’s “social being” shapes his action.4
What sets Kosambi apart from some others who began to “apply” Marxism to Indian history around the same time, was his determination to maintain, and, indeed, increase, the standard of rigour in his factual and textual research. His own work on the Sanskrit poet and grammarian, Bhatrihari, published during the years 1945-48 was in the best “Orientalist” tradition. In 1949 in his review of S A Dange’s India from Primitive Communism to Slavery, published that year, he took Dange to task for his gross errors of fact and lack of linguistic comprehension, and issued a notable caution: “Marxism is not a substitute for thinking, but a tool of analysis”.5
In the same article Kosambi noted that “most of our source material was first collected, analysed and arranged by foreign scholars”, though he agreed that the British historians’ writings had been coloured by their “national and class prejudices”.6 He would not also allow any pandering to nationalist or communal prejudices. This was especially brought forth in his critical review of the first three volumes of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan’s History and Culture of the Indian People, with K M Munshi and R C Majumdar as the principal editors. Observing that Islam’s chief contribution to India was to increase commodity production in the feudal period, he noted dryly that this was the period “when Munshis and Majumdars were created, though not their mentality”.7
For Kosambi, Marxism required more academic rigour, not less, while it dealt with a far more extensive area than the one over which research had conventionally been conducted. The post-modernist insistence on the non-separation of subject and discourse had not been heard of in his time; in fact, that separation was basic to his method. The critical tools shaped by “orientalism”, or, in India’s case, “Indology”, had to be perfected further, not thrown away or bypassed. This was the thrust of his influential paper ‘Combined Methods in Indology’, published in the most “orientalist” of journals, the Indo-Iranian Journal, in 1963.8 Here Kosambi takes up words and concepts and offers important hypotheses on the basis of critical studies of them. He also insisted on fieldwork, that is, looking at customs and practices whether recorded in the past or found, unrecorded, among contemporary primitive communities or, for that matter, among Brahmans, so as to trace earlier situations from later distorted or altered survivals.9
With the knowledge so gained, and constantly expanded, Kosambi embarked on his ambitious project of studying Indian history on the basis of his own understanding of the ideas of historical materialism laid out by Marx and Engels. An early critique of a Soviet writer D A Suleikin in 1951 and, then, a clearly outlined statement of his own views on the stages of evolution of Indian history in 1954 were preliminary indications of where his research and reflection were leading him.10
Two years later, in 1956, came Kosambi’s major historical work, An Introduction to the Study of Indian History, Bombay, which substantiated and extended his views on both how Marxist insights needed to be used to reconstruct Indian history and how history would appear after being thus reconstructed. It was not intended to be a straightforward narrative: it assumed that the reader has read the conventional “bourgeois” textbooks by V A Smith and his successors. After expressly locating his basic approach in Marxist theory, Kosambi eschewed conventional narrative and raised such problems as he thought to be important in successive periods. He, however, often enters lanes and by-lanes, linked to the main path of his argument, whether to substantiate a hypothesis by appealing to a distant piece of evidence or just to record a curiosity. He could also go forward and then come back: In his Chapter VII, Asoka came first, and “the pre-Asokan state and administration” later: this apparently seemed to him to be the more convenient way to present his argument.
From a less sure hand, such a procedure might have looked especially idiosyncratic, but the mere weight of what Kosambi had to say reduced all such objections to petty carping.
In the first place, Kosambi profoundly redefined the message that Marxism had for historians. In an attempt to impart to the Marxist perception of class struggle and its different forms the colour of universal application, the “Leningrad discussions” of the 1920s had led to the conclusion that the unilinear succession of modes of production, primitive community-slavery-feudalism-capitalism, was followed in practically all countries, except for those with very recent immigrant populations. This thesis played its part in countering the belief fostered in western social democracy that, in the words of an anti-communist propagandist, Karl A Wittfogel, “class-struggle far from being a chronic disease of all mankind is the luxury of multi-centred and open [that is, Western] societies”.11 But having played its due part in controverting such beliefs, the standard scheme of periodisation began to gravely shackle Marxist historiography. By overuse both “slavery” and “feudalism” seemed to lose all meaning when the most divergent forms of social organisation in different societies went on being assigned to these two categories, just to keep formally to the standard scheme. Kosambi now boldly asserted that Marxist historians ought to take their cue only from the basic thesis about how social evolution occurs, and not blindly apply a single prescribed pattern.
Taking the case of India, Kosambi summarily rejected the view that it had ever passed through a phase of slavery. Rather it was the construction of caste-society that happened here – a cruel form of bondage, but different, nevertheless, from slavery. He argued that the term “Asiatic” occurring in Marx’s passage in the Preface to the Critique of Political Economy should be taken to cover a case like India’s and, for this reason, the term should not be ignored, as had been done in Stalin’s interpretation of the passage.12 This did not mean that he accepted for the “Asiatic”, the sense of a stagnant despotic system, as some of Marx’s own words would suggest.
Indeed, Kosambi directly contested Marx’s observations about the “unchangeableness” of Asiatic societies. Conceding that these remarks were “acute and brilliant”, he yet held that the proposition was “misleading” and “cannot be taken as it stands”.13 It was as if Kosambi was inviting historians to take Marx’s method and apply it to Indian history on a clean slate; and his own book was to serve as an illustration of what could be achieved if this was done.
What Kosambi set out to do in his Introduction was, therefore, to investigate both the economic basis (“the means and relations of production”) and the changing beliefs, customs, and culture (“superstructure”) and their mutual relationships. In carrying out this task he raised questions that conventional historians too found challenging and exciting. For example, should not the technology of production be closely studied, so as to understand the nature of the social organisation that corresponded to it? Quite early in his book he commented:
The villages did not exist “from times immemorial”. The advance of plough-using agrarian village economy over tribal India is a great historical achievement by itself.14
Before Kosambi, little work had been done on the history of technology in India; his senior friend, P K Gode, was practically the lone scholar in the field, with a series of papers on the most diverse devices and processes of manufacture in ancient and medieval times. But the evidence available had not yet been assembled and critically analysed. Kosambi underlined the importance of this aspect of history by his numerous references to tools and products, such as the late use of the shaft-hole axe or the arrival of the coconut no earlier than the first century AD.
On the other side of the spectrum was religion: Kosambi saw in religious beliefs and ritual the reflections of economic and social circumstances which he so loved to trace often in minute detail.16 Religion was also the means by which exploited classes could be kept reconciled to their position, believing it to be divinely ordained, and, by such consent, reducing the amount of violence (with the expenses involved) which would be otherwise needed to keep them under control.17 To Kosambi, this role of religion provides the key to a proper understanding of the rise of the caste system.
To begin with, he had no quarrel with the suggestion made by many Indologists that the Shudra class arose largely out of the subjugated Dasas, though some of the latter were admitted into the Aryan fold as well. Such a situation, however, would not of itself create a caste system as the parallel Iranian development showed.18 The evidence as to how castes were created could be seen in the evolution of the priestly Brahman caste.
Kosambi shows that Brahman priests did not belong to any tribe and there were non-Aryan priests who also entered their ranks. He concluded that the Brahmans created the model for the other castes: “With him (the Brahman)”, he says, “begins the later reorganisation into caste”.19 The priest served not only as the model but also, of course, the religious spokesman of the caste system. There was another process too behind the formation of castes, namely, “tribal elements” being “fused into a general society”.20 Kosambi appeals to contemporary ethnography to show how endogamous tribes or clans have been absorbed into society as castes.21 In a sense, then, priestly consolidation, on the one hand, and tribal absorption into the agrarian population, on the other, have been the historical sources for the creation of a caste system, serving for India’s major institutional frame for exploitative relationships. One can here go back to what Kosambi had said in his 1954 ISCUS article:
Caste is class at a primitive level of production, a religious method of forming social consciousness in such a manner that the primary producer is deprived of his surplus with the minimum coercion.22
Kosambi has much to say in the Introduction about the growth of the states, the rise of Jainism and Buddhism, the punch-marked coins and the economy of the Mauryan Empire. Important as many points made by Kosambi about these themes are, lack of space forbids a discussion of these here. However, one cannot leave Kosambi’s reconstruction of Indian history without a comment on his acceptance of a stage of feudalism spanning the period from that of the Guptas to the Mughals.
Kosambi recognised that the elements of demesne-farming and serfdom, crucial to the Marxian perception of feudalism as a mode of production, were missing here; but he believed that other features were common between the Indian and European forms, viz, low level of production techniques, growth of rusticity and decline of urban life, political decentralisation and service tenures, and that these justified one to designate the mode of production in India for well over a millennium as “feudal”.23 In the political and fiscal spheres, he discerned two different processes of feudalisation: (1) “From above”, when centralised states created local rights by grants and concessions; and (2) “From below”, when “landowners developed from within the village [to stand] between the state and the peasantry”.24 There seems to be an echo here of Marx’s formulation about capitalists emerging from above (merchants) and below (craftsmen). It may be noted that Kosambi’s remarks about the period of Muslim dynasties (thirteenth to seventeenth centuries) also contain many important insights and suggestions: For instance, we have from him the significant proposition that “Islamic raiders” played “a role similar to that of the Aryans over two millennia earlier, in breaking down hidebound custom, in the adoption and transmission of new technique”.25
One needs to stress that like any work of history, Kosambi’s work too is limited by the evidence available at the time it was composed; and there is the further matter of the range of an author’s own extent of knowledge (vast enough in Kosambi’s case) and his own subjective preferences when attempting an analysis of existing evidence. Kosambi asked questions few or none had asked before, and as a pioneer many of the solutions he proposed needed verification. Some assumptions (such as the one regarding the absence of plough in the Indus Civilisation) were not sustained as more evidence came to light. For Kosambi himself, the Introduction was not the end-product of his research. He continued to contribute research papers and published two important collections of essays,26 and a straightforward restatement of his major findings in The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India in Historical Outline, published from London in 1965.27 Death took Kosambi away the very next year when he was at the height of his powers – not yet even 60. But he had done enough to ensure that history-writing in India would not be the same again.
On late December evening in 1963 at Pune, Barun De (later to be professor and director, Centre for the Study of Social Sciences, Kolkata) and I called on Kosambi at his house. I had arranged the interview on telephone but perhaps I was not able to explain clearly who both of us were, since we had no claim on his attention other than a desire to have his darshan. He apparently thought we were some Soviet scholars. As may be imagined he was none too pleased when he found that we were not the guests he expected. A certain coolness on his part was the natural result and Kosambi was not the one to hide it. He spoke acidly of his bad experience with some people at my university (Aligarh) where he had served early in his career. Seeking to turn the conversation into other channels, Barun mentioned that we were due to attend H D Sankalia’s lecture the next day. This too did not help matters: “Oh, Sankalia! He would show you how the primitive people of Narbada culture had windows in their houses, as if they were cottages in Sussex.” (Sankalia must have had some telepathic means of knowing about our conversation, because the next evening he began his lecture with a respectful reference to Kosambi as a theoretician, while he himself was only a fieldworker. The windows, however, were there on the slides.) When exactly Kosambi changed his mind about us I cannot tell; but soon interpreting prehistory and tracing its distorted survivals in enough we found him showing us microliths and explaining living communities. We had an evening to remember all our why you could not cross the Ghats along just any straight line lives. Kosambi later visited Aligarh especially to see the early you choose. Even a sudden recollection that I had in an article iron site of Atranji Khera. He had wonderful stamina, and when in Seminar expressed reservations about his hypothesis of I received him at the railway station, he insisted on carrying his feudalism from above and below did not lessen his gracious own rucksack. Who could then imagine we would so soon lose friendliness, and he continued telling us about properly him for ever?

Article 5 is the latest entry into the dystopia market for teen and young adult readers. It’s the debut novel from Kristen Simmons, a social worker-turned-writer, and it bears many of the earmarks of a first book, particularly a not-so-original story and less-than-sparkling prose. It is, in essence, a mash-up for teens of several much better books: Margaret Atwood’s Handmaiden’s Tale (1985), Octavia Butler’s Parable of the Sower (1993), and Cormac McCarthy’s The Road (2006). Just for good measure, the book’s central relationship is vaguely reminiscent of The Hunger Games.
The book won’t win any originality awards, but it’s a decent pastiche. Its setting is a not-so-distant future in which the United States has been devastated by an unexplained war. Many of the cities have been abandoned, those that remain have degenerated into self-contained neighborhoods beyond which one does not wish to stray (á la Parable of the Sower), and the Bill of Rights has been scrapped in favor of something called the Moral Statutes. The new governing authority is one part theocratic and one part military junta–think a Christian version of the Taliban.
We meet Lori Whittman, a freewheeling/free loving single mom living in what used to be Memphis, presumably in one of those suburbs populated by holier-than-thou evangelicals. In post-apocalyptic America, those Christian patients now run the asylum–literally. Women are now fair game and Lori is about to be arrested by the Federal Bureau of Reformation–whose officers are nicknamed the Moral Militia, MM for short–and sent away to a reeducation center for her ex post facto sins. Moreover, Lori’s transgression of Article 5 morals codes also taints her daughter, 17-year-old Ember Miller, who will be sent to a reform school until she is 18. She will be expected to cleanse her spirit, abandon her will, wear modest clothing, defer to men, and conform to the patriarchy that governs the United States. (That’s the Handmaiden’s Tale part.) To make matters worse, the arrest force includes Chase Jennings, a young man on whom Ember once had a serious crush, but is now a dead-eyed MM foot soldier.
As in all such books, Ember is too strong-willed to adapt to the Dickensian reform school to which she’s sent, or to put up with its sadistic head mistress. She is fixated upon escaping and rescuing her mother, though readers are as clueless as Ember on how she’s going to do this. Chase aids her flight, but can she trust him? (Think the dynamics of Katniss and Peeta in The Hunger Games.) The two set off across burnt over and burnt out parts of country, where they will have to fend off desperate postwar survivors who would be happy to rob and kill them. They are making their way toward South Carolina, allegedly a refuge beyond the control of the MM. And, of course, they meet with Resistance fighters. (The Road, anybody?)
We’ve seen all this before in much better literary form and with far greater dramatic development. Simmons’ novel has logic holes through which one could drive several commandeered vehicles. For all its obvious flaws, though, the book is a breezy read–a classic guilty pleasure. Grade it a B for pastiche, a C for drama, and a D for originality. It’s also pretty much a PG-13 book devoid of sex or graphic descriptions of violence. Assuming you’re a non-evangelical parent, the book could be used to discuss with teens important issues such as the role of women in society, who defines morality, and who watches the moral watchers. Adult readers will probably find it little more than light airplane reading that sends them back to Margaret Atwood. Who can begrudge a book that renews interest in that fine North American woman of letters? --Rob Weir
PS– ­While I’m handing out grades, how about an F for our current state of society? As an educator, I’m alarmed by how few young people have the slightest belief in the possibility of utopia, but can easily conjure a Hunger Games/Article 5 nightmare future. What does it say about our society when vampires, zombies, and a Mad Max future populate the teen reading world?
Some Bright Morning was recorded in Massachusetts, but Ray Bonneville’s guitar contribution for “Travelin’ Shoes” was sent from Texas–an apt device for a project that obliterates lots of boundaries. Categorizing daisy mayhem’s music is a challenge. Arbo has a penchant for gospel music with a secular tinge, which one will hear to beautiful effect on “Crossing the Bar,” her musical scoring of the famed Tennyson poem. But then there’s Anand Nayak’s cover of Bruce Springsteen’s “Reason to Believe,” which is what The Boss might have done it if he was feeling a little bit country. Nayak confounds again On “Johnny Brown” with his down-and-dirty electric guitar that’s somewhere between Chicago-style and Delta blues. And, of course, the band follow with a tune called “Fall River” that sounds as if it was penned to honor the hamlet in southern Tennessee, not the city in southern Massachusetts. That’s also closer to the neck of the woods Andrew Kinsey explores on “Fire in the Sky,” with a vocal that sounds like he’s channeling Ralph Stanley. But when the band gets to an honest-to-goodness Appalachian chestnut like “East Virginia”–a variant of a Child Ballad no less–we get a slowed-down and soulful treatment with sensitive fiddle and guitar solos, not the expected bluegrass breakdown. And let’s give a nod to the singer songwriter tradition while we’re at it. Arbo has two (completely) original compositions on this album, “Bridges” and the “Miami Moon.” The first is Arbo’s musing on the parallel destruction done by Hurricane Irene and the dissolution of a friend’s marriage; the second a swingy song to honor a departed neighbor who loved to dance. Try to get the chorus of “Miami Moon” out of your head. Give up? Complete surrender–that’s my suggested response to everything on this fine album.
Longtime Great Big Sea (GBS) mainstay Séan McCann also indulges his singer/songwriter persona. Son of a Sailor is his second solo release and the material and feel of it suggest he’s evolving a new genre: Salt Water & Western. The album consists of ten songs that explore blue-collar life, plebian dreams, and everyday heartaches. To set the mood, McCann varies his vocal styles. Sometimes he’s a smooth tenor, sometimes a winsome (and ironic) Irishman, and at other moments he’s earnest, raspy-voiced, and contemplative. Above all, he’s a storyteller. “The Reply (the ballad of John and Mary)” is an across-time love song based loosely on his grandparents that’s like a conversation between two hearts beating in unison. “Soldier’s Song” is an interior look into men deployed away from home that reminds us that they generally think about family, not manufactured warrior ideals. McCann also sings of the lure of the sea (“Rather be a Sailor”), but he balances the ideal with the real. In “Another Long Goodbye” he cleverly uses the romantic ambience of the tune to strip away overly romantic notions of what hard work and seafaring entail. Those who know McCann only from GBS will find his solo efforts less rowdy, more personal, and more folksy than pop. You have to make your way to “Back to You,” the final track, before you get anything that approaches GBS in energy. That’s not a dig; McCann’s quiet, reflective side is sublime.

Mam u rocked at home 🙂 Thankyou for such an amazing recipe. I and my husband totally loved it. This recipe is far far better than the market one. I paired it with Mexican salsa rice and laccha parantha. Wow Dinner. Thankyou very much for such perfect measurements.
Made it y'day with some slight modifications and it was a super hit. Love your unique and interesting combination side dishes. Will be visiting your blog more often 🙂
I heard about using bottle gourd for making butter panneer from my sister-in-law's mom. She had made it when we visited for lunch and the thing is we did not even notice the difference. I then googled to find the proportions, changes required and found them here. I've made it for dinner today and it looks just like the butter panneer my mom would make. Thank you.
One of my favorite dishes of all time. I think your spicing and proportions are perfect. Lovely image. I am craving paneer right this moment.
Wow !! Grated Bottle Guard.. My friend caklled me up just now and asked me to check your new recipe..
this is nicely done. I liked the addition of melon seeds and bottlegourd to make the gravy… nice one
AFI announced today the films that will play in the Special Screenings, Cinema’s Legacy and Shorts sections at AFI FEST 2017 presented by Audi.
Back in June, movie maestro John Williams took to the Dolby Theatre stage in Hollywood to accept the AFI Life Achievement Award before an audience of his closest friends and collaborators — including award presenter Steven Spielberg, who has collaborated with the composer on more than 25 projects. The night’s starry guests and speakers also included actors Drew Barrymore and Harrison Ford, STAR WARS directors J.J. Abrams and George Lucas and basketball legend Kobe Bryant, who shared a unique anecdote about what Williams’ music means to him. The televised special, AFI LIFE ACHIEVEMENT AWARD: A TRIBUTE TO JOHN WILLIAMS, was broadcast on TNT in…
With STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS hitting theaters this week, we dug up a vintage American Film™ magazine interview with George Lucas published just before the release of the first STAR WARS film in 1977. Long before the space opera franchise would land in the hands of director J.J. Abrams, Lucas started developing STAR WARS in the early 1970s, even before he piloted his sophomore feature AMERICAN GRAFFITI (1973) to worldwide success at age 28. When talking about STAR WARS in this interview, Lucas revealed he “wanted to do a modern fairy tale, a myth” that explores the “bigger, mysterious world in space that is more interesting…
When Marty McFly and Doc Brown traveled into the future, they landed on October 21, 2015. Pop culture and science fiction fans have waited years for the real date to become reality—and that moment has arrived!
What’s more interesting is that some of the technology and trend predictions that are depicted in the franchise are becoming reality (hoverboards, culture fusions, quickening pace of life, holographic technology).
Let’s take a look at the major characters and events of the film, portrayed on the collection of Back to the Future merchandise for sale on our site. Use the buttons below to navigate through our list.
The “Back to the Future” trilogy features the quick-witted and rebellious Marty McFly as the protagonist. Despite being a risk-taker, he’s a good-hearted guy and displays loyalty to the friends and family around him—and he’s accident-prone. Which leads to a variety of difficult situations and timeline changes. Nevertheless his intelligence and bravery saves the time-stream and the lives of people he cares about. No wonder we still adore him 30 years later!
“Back to the Future” popularized the real-life DeLorean. Within the trilogy, the car achieved time travel capabilities when it reached 88 miles per hour. In theory, its flux capacitor activated a time wormhole and the driver slipped into a time-stream and arrived at a chosen period in the past or future. Marty McFly, and Doc Brown, journeyed from 1885 to 2015 throughout all the three films.
Another important source of fuel for the DeLorean time machine was plutonium. Since it wasn’t available in 1955, Doc Brown devised a plan to use lightning. He directed electricity to the car by hooking up wires from the vehicle to a clocktower which attracted lightning strikes (“Back to the Future” 1 and 2).
Did you know that the BTTF Clocktower was featured in other Hollywood movies? Since 1948 the Clocktower was displayed in An Act of Murder, Inherit the Wind, To Kill A Mockingbird, Bye Bye Birdie, Gremlins, Bruce Almighty and Ghost Whisperer.
Hill Valley, California is a fictional town in the Sierra Nevada Mountains that serves as the central setting for the events occurring throughout all three BTTF movies. The real location of the town is the backlot of Universal Studios. The landmark Courthouse Square also appears in other movies.
The cars which appear in the 2015 scenes are modifications or concept automobiles: the Ford Probe, Saab EV-1, Citroën DS 21, Pontiac Banshee Concept, Pontiac Fiero and Volkswagen Beetle. The “Star Car” and “Spinner” vehicles are props in The Last Starfighter and Blade Runner, respectively.
The antagonist in all three BTTF films involved Biff Tannen (played by Thomas F. Wilson). In the first movie he was a bully who almost altered the original timeline. The second film portrayed him as a corrupt businessman with powerful political influences. His ancestral grandfather, who resembled Biff himself, attempted to stop Marty in the third movie.
The Pit Bull was an advanced hoverboard model from the “Back to the Future” 2015 timeline; powered by rockets which allowed for extremely rapid trips with the device.
Marty and Doc Brown found themselves stranded in 1885 because the DeLorean time machine was depleted of gasoline. To reach 1985, Marty devised a scheme to utilize a locomotive to push the car and reach 88 miles per hour. After McFly returned to 1985, the train reappeared as a “Time Train” (the “Jules Verne Train”) with Doc Brown (from 1885) operating it.
To this day, BTTF fans are still debating how Doc Brown constructed the locomotive time travel machine.
Celebrate the October 21st Back to the Future Day with our collection of merchandise. If you’ve been waiting for this date or you’ve been a fan since 1985, you will enjoy the variety of products that you can order online. Browse today!
Grumpy Cat – Nope Not since the debut of Garfield has pop culture fixated on a cat. After “Grumpy Cat” appeared on … More
I can't believe it's mid-August. The summer has just flown by and the days are shorter. At the end of the summer, I always have a weird, regretful longing that I'd gone camping more or floating more or swimming or running or... Everything. I suppose it's the nature of the beast (and by beast I mean my inner 7 year old) to wish the days of summer lasted longer, but that's why summer is so fleeting: we know it doesn't last forever.
While I did do so many new things this year, I didn't do much of what I love. I didn't mountain bike or hike as much as I wanted to, I didn't barbeque as regularly warranted with the purchase of a new grill and I didn't road trip. At all.
The fear that comes with the final bright, sunny days of the season stems from unaccomplished adventures and the knowledge that serious business is afoot. Whether it was school as a child or work/commitment/obligations now, it still strikes a sour note to realize that the carefree days have disappeared.
In the interim, I'll be leaving the country. I haven't decided where or when, exactly, I'll be leaving, but it's time to travel alone. It's time to assault my entire being with culture shock and to experience new friends, new memories and new... Freedom. I'm just beginning to realize that the only thing holding me back for the last while has been ME. There is a refreshing honesty in admitting my boredom and stagnancy. If I return broke and jaded, at least there will be stories. If I don't return at all, there will be mystery -- life requires mystery. So I'll travel alone and find whatever it is that needs finding. I may update this page, I may not.

WESTON, WI- A Wausau-area video production company is shining a spotlight on the need for American Indian children to be connected to their culture.
Rucinski & Reetz Communication unveiled last week its video titled "Missing Threads: The Story of the Wisconsin Indian Child Welfare Act."
The hour-long documentary represents nearly three years of work and "explores the connection between family, tribal culture and children, and the consequences of severing those ties," said Susan Reetz, a partner in the communication firm.
white families, according to the film. The practice occurred well into the 20th century, spurring the passage of a 1978 federal law called the Indian Child Welfare Act was passed, requiring state, county and private agencies to follow specific processes when removing Indian children from their homes, according to the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families. Those processes sought to ensure that government and private agencies would make an effort to place children in Indian families. The
film documents the passage of the Wisconsin Indian Child Welfare Act, which became law in 2009, and was designed to bolster and add to the federal law.
"It really was the deprivation of a race," said retired state senator Robert Jauch, one of the sponsors of the 2009 law."It was unexcusable, unacceptable and avoidable."
Indian children could have been removed from their families for a variety areas, but many were "taken from their homes simply because a paternalistic state system failed to recognize traditional Indian culture and expected Indian children to conform to non-Indian ways," wrote B.J. Jones of the Dakota Plaines Legal Services in a piece published by the American Bar Association.
I have a question, if as a illegally adopted and displaced person, how does one hold the agency of placement accountable and responsible? Is there legal rights to do so?
Melissa, I would hope you could but sadly, I am not a lawyer and don't know. If you have free legal aid, call them first for an opinion. In Wisconsin, they do have services. I worked with their state adoption specialist to get a court order to read my adoption file. Use the contact form if you need me to send you an email address or phone number.

Veronica, we adult adoptees are thinking of you today and every day. We will be here when you need us. Your journey in the adopted life has begun, nothing can revoke that now, the damage cannot be undone. Be courageous, you have what no adoptee before you has had; a strong group of adult adoptees who know your story, who are behind you and will always be so.
As the single largest unregulated industry in the United States, adoption is viewed as a benevolent action that results in the formation of “forever families.”
The truth is that it is a very lucrative business with a known sales pitch. With profits last estimated at over $1.44 billion dollars a year, mothers who consider adoption for their babies need to be very aware that all of this promotion clouds the facts and only though independent research can they get an accurate account of what life might be like for both them and their child after signing the adoption paperwork.

“…sometimes shocking, often an emotional read…this book is for individuals interested in the culture and history of the Native American Indian, but also on the reading lists of universities offering ethnic/culture/Native studies.”
“Well-researched and obviously a subject close to the heart of the authors/compilers, I found the extent of what can only be described as ‘child-snatching’ from the Native Americans quite staggering. It’s not something I was aware of before…”
“The individual pieces are open and honest and give a good insight into the turmoil of dislocation from family and tribe… I think it does have value and a story to tell. I was affected by the stories I read, and amazed by the facts presented…. because it is saying something new, interesting and often astonishing.”

I agree with you on the caring of “orphans” – true orphans, not “paper orphans” as Kathryn Joyce describes in her book, The Child Catchers. The most important thing to remember, however, is that the orphan’s original identity and family connection and heritage must remain intact and available to him or her forever. This business of adoption – and I do mean the multi-billion-dollar, unregulated business of adoption – of wiping out the child’s original identity, falsifying birth records with the adopters’ names, altering facts such as place of birth, severing familial kinship, must stop … Immediately. And the outrageous injustices foisted upon adoptees and their families for the past 100 years must be addressed and righted. We are faced today with six to seven million people who were basically legally kidnapped, sold to the highest bidder, their identities falsified, and placed in a lifelong, imposed witness protection program for which there is no legal recourse. Then told by church officials, agency and government functionaries that they have no right to know who they are, to do genealogy or learn about important family medical history, or know the identity of or associate with blood relatives. This is how the Judeo-Christian society has interpreted “caring for orphans”, for it’s own selfish interests and greed. Starting with Georgia Tann, the woman charged with kidnapping and selling 5,000 children, most of whom were given to the rich and powerful who then colluded with her to “seal” adoptions and cover their nefarious activities (see, for example, Gov. Herbert Lehman, NY, 1935).

So far so good, now comes the tricky part, I have http server enabled on my system and since this is on local network with already firewall and other security in place so I can allow all incoming to my system and similarly I need to enable XDMCP outgoing. So, I can add the rules like this :
This works only till I reboot my system and is not persistent. Okay, so I can put this in rc.local file. But why I should do that, there should be more elegnant way. So, I searched and finally found that I can simply put the rules in /etc/sysconfig/iptables as follows:

2. where goods are sent by a principal located in one State to a job worker located in any other State, the e-way bill shall be generated by the principal irrespective of the value of the consignment.It is to be noted that limit of Rs. 50000/- in case of intra-state movement of goods for job work purposes will continue to apply.
3. where handicraft goods are transported from one State to another by a person who has been exempted from the requirement of obtaining registration under clauses (i) and (ii) of section 24, the e-way bill shall be generated by the said person irrespective of the value of the consignment.
Consignment value of Rs. 50000/- as stated above has to be determined in accordance with Section 15 of CGST Act, which deals with valuation of supply and the consignment value of Rs. 50000/- shall be counted by including not only the value of goods but also the GST and Cess if any charged on it.
Generation of E-way bill: Eway bill has two parts,Part-A and Part-B. Part-A includes details of invoice/challan/credit note and the details of receipient and transporter, whereas Part-B only has information with regard to vehicle no. when you have prepared invoice relating to your business transaction, but don’t have the transportation details. You can enter invoice details in Part-A of eway bill and keep it ready for transportation, once the transportation is ready.
It is worth mentioning here that mere filing Part-A is not valid for movement of goods on road, except for the movement of goods from the place of the supplier or the receipient as the case may be to the place of transporter where the distance between the two is less than 10 KMs.
Who is to file Part-A: Part-A has to be filed mandatorily by the registered person who causes the movement of goods whether as consignor or as consignee or as recipient, whether the goods are transported in his own conveyance or by railways or by air or by vessel.
Part-A can also be filed by the transporter and it is mandatory for the transporter to file Part-A, if the supplier or receipient fails to do so and the consignment value exceed Rs. 50000/-
For example if A transporter is carrying 5 different consignments of five different suppliers and receipients in one vehicle the value of each consignment is say Rs. 20000/-, in such case the total value of consignments carried in the vehicle comes to Rs. 100000/- In such case although it was not mandatory for supplier of receipient of each consignment to generate eway bill but in such case it is mandatory for the transporter to generate eway bill by filing both Part-A and Part-B.
Part-A can also be filed by an unregistered person voluntarily, however, it has been stated in Explanation 2 of Rule 138(3) that if goods are supplied by an unregistered person to a registered recipient and recipient is known at the time of commencement of movement of goods, then the movement shall be said to be caused by such registered receipient.
In other words meaning thereby if supply is by an unregistered person to a registered person, then it is mandatory for the registered receipient to generate eway bill, ofcource if the consignment value exceed Rs. 50000/-.
Where the goods to be transported are supplied through an e-commerce operator (for example: amazon, flipkart etc), Part-A may also be furnished by such e-commerce operator.
Who is to file Part-B: As stated above also, Part B only contains information with regard to vehicle number.
In case movement is caused by own conveyance or a hired conveyance, it is the person causing the movement has to file Part-B
In case of movement by rail or by air or vessel Part -B has to be mandatorily filed by the registered person and along with it the serial number and date of Railway Receipt or the Air consignment note or Bill of Lading are also required to mentioned in the Part-A.
If the goods are handed over to a transporter for transportation by Road Part-B will be filed by the transporter.
The unique feature of Eway bill is that Part B of eway bill can be updated in the following circumstances:
1. where the goods are transferred from one conveyance to another, in such case Part-B will be mandatorily updated with new vehicle number before such transfer and further movement of goods.
For example: If the vehicle breaks down when the goods are being carried with EWB, then the transporter can cause to repair the vehicle and continue the journey. If he is going to change the vehicle, then he has to enter the new vehicle details for that EWB on the web-site using ‘Update vehicle number’ option and continue the journey with new vehicle.
Part-B can be updated as many times as it Is required but should be done within validity period. It has also been further provided in 2nd proviso to Rule 138(9) that the unique number generated by filing Part-A shall be valid for 72 hours for updation of Part-B.
2. There may be instances that transporter assign the consignment to other transporter after booking from the supplier or recipient. In such situation Rule 138(5A) provides that the transporter may assign the e-way bill number to another registered or enrolled transporter for updating the information in Part-B. It is worth noting here that whenever Part-A is filed by the registered person and he has to mention the transporter’s GSTIN or enrollment id in Part-A, if the goods are handed over to transporter.
However, once the details of the conveyance are updated by the transporter in part-B then supplier or recipient who had furnished Part-A will not be allowed to assign the eway bill number to another transporter.
Validity of E-way Bill: E-way Bill’s validity has been prescribed under Rule 138 in terms of distance involved in the movement of goods. It as follows:
It should be noted here that the period of validity shall be counted from the time at which the e-way bill has been generated and each day shall be counted as twenty four hours.
Rule 138(10) further provides that where, under circumstances of an exceptional nature, the goods cannot be transported within the validity period of the e-way bill, the transporter may generate another e-way bill after updating the details in Part B of FORM GST EWB-01.
Cancellation of E-way Bill: Rule 138(9) provides for cancellation of eway bill within 24 hours of generation of the e-way bill, which can be done in the following circumstances:
However, an e-way bill cannot be cancelled if it has been verified in transit in accordance with the provisions of rule 138B.
Consolidated E-way bill: Where multiple consignments are intended to be transported in one conveyance, the transporter may indicate the serial number of e-way bills generated in respect of each such consignment electronically on the common portal and a consolidated e-way bill in FORM GST EWB-02 maybe generated by him on the said common portal prior to the movement of goods.
Acceptence and rejection of e-way bills: The eway bills generated shall be made available to a registered supplier if generated by recipient or transporter and vice versa to the registered recipient if generated by supplier or transporter. The same has to be accepted or rejected by the supplier or recipient as the case may be, however if nothing is done within seventy two hours then it shall be deemed that he has accepted the said details.
When no e-way bill is required:Rule 138(14) provides with a non-abstante clause the circumstances where no eway bill is required, these are as follows:
(c) where the goods are being transported from the port, airport, air cargo complex and land customs station to an inland container depot or a container freight station for clearance by Customs;
(d) in respect of movement of goods within such areas as are notified under clause (d) of sub-rule (14) of rule 138 of the Goods and Services Tax Rules of the concerned State;
(e) where the goods, other than de-oiled cake, being transported are specified in the Schedule appended to notification No. 2/2017- Central tax (Rate) dated the 28th June, as amended from time to time;(the schedule is for tax free or nil rated goods)
(f) where the goods being transported are alcoholic liquor for human consumption, petroleum crude, high speed diesel, motor spirit (commonly known as petrol), natural gas or aviation turbine fuel; and
Documents and devices to be carried with a conveyance: Rule 138A prescribes following documents which a person incharge of a conveyance must carry:
(b) a copy of the e-way bill or the e-way bill number, either physically or mapped to a Radio Frequency Identification Device embedded on to the conveyance in such manner as may be notified by the Commissioner.(there is no such notification till the date when this article is written).
(c) Rule 138A(2) also provides facility of generation of Invoice reference number by uploading on the e-way bill portal the tax invoice in form GST INV-1, which will be valid for thirty days from the date of uploading and in which case no physical invoice is required to be carried along with the conveyance.
Verification of documents and conveyance: Rule 138B and Rule 138C empowers the proper officer (who is duly authorized to do so either by Commissioner or an officer empowered in this regard)to intercept any conveyance to verify the e-way bill or number thereof.
Physical verification of conveyance can be done only by the proper officer who is duly athorised to do so, however physical verification of conveyance can also be done by any officer other than proper officer after obtaining necessary approval, if there is receipt of specific information on evasion of tax.
Rule 138C also mandates the proper officer to record online summary inspection report of every inspection of goods in transit in Part-A of form GST EWB 03 and a final report within three days in Part-B of the said form.
Once a physical verification of a conveyance is done in a state or in any other State then further physical verification can be done unless a specific information with regard to evasion of tax is made available subsequently.
Question: How to enter multiple modes of transportation, i.e., road, rail, ship, air for the same e-way bill?
Answer: One e-way bill can go through multiple modes of transportation before reaching the destination. As per the mode of transportation, the EWB can be updated with new mode of transportation by using ‘Update Vehicle Number’.
Let us assume the goods are moving from Cochin to Chandigarh through road, ship, air and road again. First, the taxpayer generates the EWB by entering first stage of movement (by road) from his place to ship yard and enters the vehicle number. Next, he will submit the goods to ship yard and update the mode of transportation as Ship and transport document number on the e-way bill system. Next, after reaching Mumbai, the taxpayer or concerned transporter updates movement as road from ship to airport with vehicle number. Next the taxpayer or transporter updates, using ‘update vehicle number’ option, the Airway Bill number. Again after reaching Delhi, he updates movement through road with vehicle number. This way, the e-way bill will be updated with multiple mode of transportation.
Answer: Some of the consignments move from one place to another place till they reach their destinations. Under this circumstance, each time the consignment moves from one place to another, the transporter needs to enter the vehicle details using ‘Update Vehicle Number’ option, when he starts moving the goods from that place or the transporter can also generate ‘Consolidated EWB’ with the EWB of that consignment with other EWBs and move to the next place. This has to be done till the consignment reaches destination. But it should be within the validity period of EWB.
Question: How to generate e-way bill for multiple invoices belonging to same consignor and consignee?
Answer: If multiple invoices are issued by the supplier to recipient, that is, for movement of goods of more than one invoice of same consignor and consignee, multiple EWBs have to be generated. That is, for each invoice, one EWB has to be generated, irrespective of same or different consignors or consignees are involved. Multiple invoices cannot be clubbed to generate one EWB. However after generating all these EWBs, one Consolidated EWB can be prepared for transportation purpose, if they are going in one vehicle.
Question: How to enter invoice having different states for “Bill to” and “Ship to” places and what will be the tax rates?
Answer: If the addresses involved in 'Bill to' and 'Ship to' in a invoice/bill belongs to one legal name/taxpayer as per GSTIN within the state, then one e-way bill has to be generated. That is, if the 'Bill to' is principal place of business and 'Ship to' is additional place of business of the GSTIN or vice versa in a invoice/bill, then one e-way bill is sufficient for the movement of goods.
If the addresses involved in 'Bill to' and 'Ship to' in a invoice/bill belongs to different legal names/taxpayers, then two e-way bills have to be generated. One e-way bill for first invoice, second e-way bill is from 'Bill to' party to 'Ship to' party based on the invoice/bill of the 'Bill to' party. This is required to complete the cycle of transactions and taxes will change for inter-state transactions.
For example, A has issued invoice to B as 'Bill to' with C as 'Ship to'. Legally, both B and C are different taxpayers. Now, A will generate one e-way bill and B will issue invoice and generate one more e-way bill. As goods are moving from A to C directly, the transporter will produce both the invoices and e-way bills to show the shortcut movement of goods.
Question: How to generate e-way bill, if the goods of one invoice is being moved in multiple vehicles simultaneously?
Answer: Where the goods are being transported in a semi knocked down or completely knocked down condition the EWB shall be generated for each of such vehicles based on the delivery challans issued for that portion of the consignment and;
(b) the supplier shall issue a delivery challan for each of the subsequent consignments, giving reference of the invoice;
(c) each consignment shall be accompanied by copies of the corresponding delivery challan along with a duly certified copy of the invoice; and
Please note that multiple EWBs have to generate under this circumstance. That is, the EWB has to be generated for each consignment based on the delivery challan details along with the corresponding vehicle number.
“semi knocked-down” is used to describe a product that is exported in a set of parts that have been partly put together, and which are then all put together for sale to customers:
"completely knocked-down" is used to describe a product that s sold or transported in a set of parts, which must be put together before the product can be used by the customer:
For example: Motorcycles can be transported in completely knocked-down kits, hich reduced transport costs because less space was needed to transport them.
The GST Council, in its 23rd meeting held at Guwahati on 10th November 2017, has recommended the followingfacilitative measuresfortaxpayers:
The Government of India vide notification 51/2017 of Central tax has amended Rule 96 and Rule 96A of the CGST Rules, 2017 to give relief to exporters in a step to speed up the refund process.
Companies have hundreds of crores of rupees in input tax credit but they may still need to pay the goods and services tax ( GST) for July and August in full, potentially disrupting working capital flows.
That’s because the relevant GSTR 3B form doesn’t provide any column for carry-forward of credit from the earlier regime of central excise duty, service tax and value added tax. Companies will thus be unable to adjust the tax paid against their liability. Experts said this does not seem to be the government’s intention and it must clarify this quickly as industry is counting on this adjustment and would now need funds to pay GST in full.
“This will cause substantial cash flow problems for the taxpayers unless the assessees are allowed to utilise transitional credit on a provisional basis,”
The GST Council, the apex decision-making body for the new tax regime, had approved a liberal transition framework to ensure smooth sailing when making the switch.
Any entity can claim credit of service tax or VAT paid in the previous regime against GST liability. If it does not have proof of payment of tax, it can take advantage of the deemed benefit norm. The key benefit of GST is that there is no cascading of tax through seamless availability of input tax credit.
Companies have to file form GSTR 3B, a summarised return, for July by August 20. That for August has to be filed by September 20.
The format of this return includes a summary of details of outward supplies, inward supplies liable to reverse charges and input tax credit eligible on various procurements made during the month. But the form does not provide space for carry-forward of credit from the earlier regime. This essentially implies that the GST liability for the months of July and August will have to be settled in cash.
There is a mechanism for claiming credit from the previous regime but that has not been integrated with the GST filing process.
This transitional credit will be available only after filing of GSTR TRAN-1 on the GSTN common portal.
Even if a taxpayer files TRAN-1 prior to August 20 (that is, prior to filing GSTR 3B for July), the credits would not be allowed to be migrated in GST as there is no specific table for disclosing opening credit in GSTR 3B. TRAN-1 and TRAN-2 are the forms for transition of input tax credit while GSTR 3B is the form in which actual GST payable is filed. To be sure, input tax credit can be availed of after September in all instances.
“It cannot be the intention of the government to deny the benefit of input credit, “It could lead to huge cashflow issues for industry, running into thousands of crores. A clarification or amendment in Form(GSTR) 3B is needed urgently.”
Subject: Leviability of Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on High Sea Sales ofimported goods and point of collection thereof-reg.
Reference has been received in the Board regarding clarity on Leviability of Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) on High Sea Sales of imported goods.
2. The issue has been examined in the Board. 'High Sea Sales' is a common trade practicewhereby the original importer sells the goods to a third person before the goods are entered forcustoms clearance. After the High sea sale of the goods, the Customs declarations i.e. Bill of Entryetc is filed by the person who buys the goods from the original importer during the said sale. Inthe past, CBEC has issued various instructions regarding high sea sales appropriating the contractprice paid by the last high sea sales buyer into the Customs valuation [Circular No. 32/2004-Cus.,dated 11-5-2004 refers].
3. As mentioned earlier, all inter-state transactions are subject to IGST. High sea sales ofimported goods are akin to inter-state transactions. Owing to this, it was presented to the Boardas to whether the high sea sales of imported goods would be chargeable to IGST twice i.e. at thetime of Customs clearance under sub-section (7) of section 3 of Customs Tariff Act, 1975 and alsoseparately under Section 5 of The Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.
4. GST council has deliberated the levy of Integrated Goods and Services Tax on high sea sales in the case of imported goods. The council has decided that IGST on high sea sale (s) transactions of imported goods, whether one or multiple, shall be levied and collected only at the time of importation i.e. when the import declarations are filed before the Customs authorities for the customs clearance purposes for the first time. Further, value addition accruing in each such high sea sale shall form part of the value on which IGST is collected at the time of clearance.
5. The above decision of the GST council is already envisioned in the provisions of sub- section (12) of section 3 of Customs Tariff Act, 1975 inasmuch as in respect of imported goods, all duties, taxes, cessess etc shall be collected at the time of importation i.e. when the import declarations are filed before the customs authorities for the customs clearance purposes. The importer (last buyer in the chain) would be required to furnish the entire chain of documents, such as original Invoice, high-seas-sales-contract, details of service charges/commission paid etc, to establish a link between the first contracted price of the goods and the last transaction. In case of a doubt regarding the truth or accuracy of the declared value, the department may reject the declared transaction value and determination the price of the imported goods as provided in the Customs Valuation rules.
6. Field formations are requested to decide the cases of high sea sales of imported goods accordingly. Difficulties, in the implementation of this circular may be brought to the knowledge
As you are aware, the higher All Industry Rates (AIRs) under Duty Drawback scheme viz. rates and caps available under columns (4) and (5) of the Schedule of All Industry Rates of Duty Drawback have been continued for a transition period of three months i.e. 1.7.2017 to 30.9.2017 (Circular No. 22/2017-Customs dated 30.6.2017).
2. Various issues have been highlighted by field formations and exporters regarding the requirement of a certificate to be obtained from the jurisdictional GST officer prescribed vide Note and Condition 12A of Notification 131/2016-Cus (N.T.) dated 31.10.2016 as amended by Notification 59/2017-Cus (N.T.) dated 29.6.2017. The certificate aimed to ensure that there was no double neutralisation of taxes by way of credit/refund and drawback. However, in view of factors such as absence of clarity about jurisdictional GST officer, time lag between exports and the requisite returns to be filed under GST laws, etc., the said certificate from GST officer may not be available immediately at the time of export.
3. Keeping in mind the above difficulties, the Government has amended Note and Condition 12A of Notification 131/2016-Cus (N.T.) dated 31.10.2016 by Notification 73/2017-Cus (N.T.) dated 26.7.2017 and dispensed with the requirement of the certificate from GST officer to claim higher rate of drawback. To facilitate exports, the higher rate of drawback can be claimed on the basis of self-declaration to be provided by exporter in terms of revised Note and Condition 12A of aforesaid Notification.
4. Since Notes and Conditions of Notification No. 131/2016-Cus (NT) dated 31.10.2016 (as amended) are integral part of the rates of drawback given under the Schedule to said Notification, accordingly in terms of the Section 75(3) of the Customs Act, 1962 and Rule 5(2) of the Customs, Central Excise Duties and Service Tax Drawback Rules, 1995, it may be noted that the changes made in Note and Condition 12A shall be applicable w.e.f. 1.7.2017 itself. Thus, exports which have been made from 1.7.2017 onwards shall be governed by the revised Note and Condition 12A. For all exports made w.e.f 1.7.2017 for which higher rate of drawback is claimed, exporter has to submit the self-declaration in the format attached. This format is also being suitably included in the EDI shipping bill. In respect of exports that have already been made, exporters may submit a single declaration regarding the export products covered in past shipping bills for which let export order has been given from 1.7.2017 onwards. This shall be irrespective of any certificate or declaration, if any, given earlier.
5. Another aspect that may be noted is that there could be cases where export goods had been cleared from factory, warehouse, etc. prior to 1.7.2017 but let export order has not been issued before 1.7.2017. Such goods are not supplies under GST and accordingly, said Note and Condition 12A is not applicable. For such goods, the declaration from exporter or certificate from the then Central Excise officer as applicable in terms of Note and Condition 12 of said Notification No. 131/2016-Customs (NT) shall continue.
6. As part of audit checks, the need for regular sample checking of the veracity of declarations accepted for disbursing AIR drawback claims has been highlighted in Board’s instruction F. No. 603/01/2011-DBK dated 11.10.2013. The said instruction is reiterated for the purpose of audit checks for above cited self-declarations. Directorate General of Audit (Central Taxes) is also being asked to have the declarations given by exporters about non-availment of ITC/refund etc. in respect of exports under drawback verified at the time of audit of these units/exporters. These checks will thus ensure that there is no double neutralisation of taxes by simultaneous availment of credit/refund and drawback.
7. In order to further facilitate exporters, it may be ensured that all pending drawback claims are disposed of on priority and zero pendency be maintained. Supplementary claims whenever filed should also be processed on priority.
8. Wide publicity on these aspects may be given by way of issuance of trade notice and field officers also should be sensitised.
Position regarding applicability of the Margin Scheme under GST for dealers in second hand goods in general andfor dealers in old and used empty bottles in particular.
Doubts have been raised regarding the applicability of the Margin Scheme under GST for dealers in second handgoods in general and for dealers in old and used empty bottles in particular.
Rule 32(5) of the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) Rules, 2017 provides that where a taxable supply isprovided by a person dealing in buying and selling of second hand goods i.e., used goods as such or after suchminor processing which does not change the nature of the goods and where no input tax credit has been availedon the purchase of such goods, the value of supply shall be the difference between the selling price and the purchase price and where the value of such supply is negative, it shall be ignored. This is known as the marginscheme.
Further, notification No.10/2017-Central Tax (Rate), dated 28.06.2017 exempts Central Tax leviable on intra-State supplies of second hand goods received by a registered person, dealing in buying and selling of second hand goods [who pays the central tax on the value of outward supply of such second hand goods as determinedunder sub-rule (5)] from any supplier, who is not registered. This has been done to avoid double taxation on theoutward supplies made by such registered person, since such person operating under the Margin Scheme cannotavail input tax credit on the purchase of second hand goods.
Thus, Margin Scheme can be availed of by any registered person dealing in buying and selling of second hand goods [including old and used empty bottles] and who satisfies the conditions as laid down in Rule 32(5) of theCentral Goods and Services Tax Rules, 2017.
drawback is continued to offset the impact of basic customs duty component, which is non-creditable tax, the drawback rate could be very less. This could impact largely, those assesses who are dependent on duty drawbacks for
shall be limited to Customs duties on imported inputs and Central Excise duty on items specified in Fourth Schedule to Central Excise Act 1944 (specified petroleum products, tobacco etc.) used as inputs or fuel for captive power generation.
For exports during this period, exporters can claim higher rate of duty drawback (composite AIR) subject to conditions that no input tax credit of CGST/IGST is claimed, no refund of IGST paid on export goods is claimed and no CENVAT credit is carried forward. A declaration from exporter and certificate from jurisdictional GST officer in this regard has been prescribed in the notification related to AIRs. This will prevent double availment of
claim refund/ITC under GST laws. All Industry Rates for the transition period shall be notified in due course of time.&#0;
The most important and the very first step towards GST is the transition provisions under GST law. The transition provisions with regard to input tax credit are very important. In this article I concentrate on how the credit of taxes paid on the goods taxable at first stage especially under Punjab VAT Act, 2005, would be available under the GST regime.
Taxable event: Taxable event is very important matter in every tax law. Its determination is most crucial for the proper implementation of any tax law. Taxable event is that on the happening of which the charge is fixed. It is that event which on its occurrence creates or attracts the liability to tax.
GST Migration starts from 16 December 2016 for State of Punjab. Migration will close on 31st December 2016. Registrants will be provided Provisional ID and Password by ETD, to Login to the GSTN Portal (www.gst.gov.in)
The migration from VAT to GST is going to start from 16th December and this migration will continue till 31st December. To migrate into GST regime a provisional user I'd and password is required, which can be obtained from the jurisdictional excise and taxation department.
The schedule of the enrolment for GST activation drive for states is given below. The date to complete the enrolment will be during the specified dates as given below. However, the window will be open till 31/01/2017 for those who miss the chance.
All the taxpayers registered under any of the Acts as specified viz. taxes which are subsumed , are expected to visit the GST System Portal and enroll themselves.
Before enrolling with GST System Portal, you must ensure to have the following information/ documents available with you:-
The network that forms the information technology backbone of the goods and services tax (GST) will start a nationwide drive, in collaboration with state governments, to collect information on around eight million traders and issue them tax identification numbers (TIN) as India prepares to implement the tax from the next fiscal year.
The Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN), as it is called, has already collated basic information like Permanent Account Number (PAN) and names from existing databases of the income-tax department but needs more detailed data like place of operation, nature of business and bank account details before it can issue a GST ID number to the traders.
All traders will need a GST ID number—a 15-digit PAN-based number—to operate under GST, which is expected to come into effect on 1 April 2017.
As per GSTN estimates, there are around 6.5 million VAT (value-added tax) dealers registered with state tax authorities, and around two million service tax and about half a million excise duty dealers registered with central authorities.
Even if there is an overlap between dealers registered with the centre and the states, GSTN estimates there will be more than eight million traders who will need to be issued GST ID numbers.
“We are making a software where the existing taxpayers can fill essential data, like place of business, name of directors, the nature of their business and bank account details, etc. We are planning to throw this site open in October. Over the next four months, we will roll out a programme in a staggered manner wherein dealers in a state can fill in all their information online,” GSTN chairman Navin Kumar said in an interview.
GSTN and the states will use a mix of newspaper advertisements, media campaigns and direct outreach to encourage taxpayers to provide information about their businesses online.
Kumar said GSTN had asked states to obtain PAN from all the traders and that this exercise has been going on for the past two years.
“We have also verified 90% of the PANs from the income-tax department’s database,” he said. “What we have now is the PAN, the name of the business and details of whether it is a company or a proprietorship. But we couldn’t extract any other information from the states as they were all in different formats.”
To be sure, even after it gathers all the necessary information, GSTN can issue the ID number only after Parliament passes three proposed laws: the Central GST, Integrated GST and the State GST.
GST is expected to remove barriers across states and integrate the country into a common market. It will subsume most of the indirect taxes levied by the centre and the states, including excise duty, service tax, VAT, entertainment tax and luxury tax. It will put the entire tax process online—right from registration, tax payment and tax return filing to refunds, audits and assessments—thereby making GSTN a very important part of the GST ecosystem.
“It is going to be a long-drawn exercise because of the huge number of assessees. The earlier they start the better. The law will get passed in the winter session. So it does not make sense to wait till then to collect information about the taxpayers else they will not be able to provide automatic registration to the traders in time,” said R. Muralidharan, senior director at Deloitte in India.

Comments have been opened up for immediate posting - the spam filters seem to be doing their job pretty well, thankfully. I love hearing from you, thanks for taking the time to post a comment!
Babies have just come from an incredibly loud womb. As in as loud as busy city traffic! They are used to loud. And if you know anything about babies, you know they like what they are used to. If you want to set your baby up for the best sleep possible, use white noise.
It helps to calm and de-stress baby, even those are are especially fussy or those with colic (see Happiest Baby on the Block 5 S's).
It's been proven to help your baby go to sleep and stay asleep longer. It helps block distracting outside noise that could potential wake baby and it helps baby more easily make it through those sometimes frustrating sleep transitions.
If you're sleeping in the same room as baby, you'll probably sleep better too! It'll help drown out baby's loud noises so you stop waking to every little sound he makes (it is the only thing that gave me any sleep with my first child who, I swear, was as loud as a pack of animals when he slept). More importantly, if you stop waking to every little sleep sound, you'll also stop trying to feed or comfort baby with every little noise he makes which can lead him to wake more frequently than he needs to. Plus, many of you will notice, even if you've never slept with it before, that white noise is really soothing for you too (ever notice that you are suddenly able to fall asleep when the ac/heat kicks in?). You'll probably miss it when baby moves out of your room and takes it with him!
It's considerate of baby. Would you want your sleep disrupted by noise all the time? Even if they sleep through it (which they probably won't unless they're super young or way overtired), their sleep is likely disrupted at times by it. Plus, pretty much every baby thinks that playing with mom, dad or siblings is a heck of a lot more fun than sleeping. So why shove it in their face that you are having the time of your life without them while they sleep. If they can hear you, you can bet that is what they're thinking.
It's a good substitute for when your about to pass out from too much shushing during those fussy evening witching hours.
I've thought about this for a while, and I've decided that it's no more a sleep prop than a lovey or crib is. You turn it on and then leave. All done. You aren't having to go in all night long to keep it running. Yes, baby often gets used to it, but he gets used to lots of other stuff too. These are sleep associations. We all have them. I for one can't sleep without 2 pillows! Given how easy white noise is to use wherever and whenever, how much it can add to your pre-sleep routine and what a strong sleep cue it can be, I'd say it is a pretty positive sleep association.
Are you still scared it'll turn into a huge sleep prop that you'll be dragging around with you for the next 16 years? Relax! Don't worry. Most kids wean off of this pretty easily and many young babies will still sleep OK without it even if they're used to it. It's easy to wean from too. All you have to do is turn the volume down. My 2 year old still sleeps better with his sound machine, but my 4 year old sleeps fine (and has done so for a while) with or without one.
You can try, but you will likely fail. And is it really worth possible weeks, months, or in the case of kids who don't get used to the noise (which, by the way, is most) forever worsened sleep? This 'sleeping with noise' might work if you have a newborn, but you'll need lots of luck to have it work later on unless (and this is a big maybe, too) your child is totally dirt tired.
I know you've probably heard that children can get used to lots of noise, but in my experience, it isn't true for most children. Noise is simply distracting when your trying to shut off your mind and sleep. People can only get used to so much.
You might look at this study and get a bit scared to use white noise. But notice that 1) this was done on rats which we are not and 2) white noise was used all the time. As in no breaks. If you are using white noise when a baby is sleeping and sometimes when he is awake and fussy, I doubt there is an issue as long as you have quality "noise time" when he is awake. As in you talk and read and sing to your baby.
Sound is measured in Decibels (dB). The farther you get from a sound, the less the decibles. How loud the sound is along with how long you hear the sound determines if your going to have hearing damage (there can be other things that add to this too, like antibiotics, but I'm not going to get into those rare instances). The current recommendation is that a sound machine should be no louder than 50 db and that you should use them for the least amount of time and at the lowest volume necessary.
You can buy devices that measure decibels (remember to take in account distance from the object) and there are even apps that'll do it for you. Or you can buy a sound machine like the marpac that has two settings-- 50 dB and 70 dB (from 6 inches).
Dr. Karp (you know, the happiest baby on the block guy) suggests you keep your shushing or white noise as loud as baby's cry, which can be quite a bit louder than 50 dB. Remember that dB, as well as length of exposure, is important so keeping a sound a little above 50 dB for a short time is fine. Many sounds around your house on a daily basis will be above 50 dB.
First off, it needs to be loud enough, but not too loud. So keep it below 50 dB but keep it loud enough that it blocks out sounds. Use a little trial and error to see what your baby likes best.
Next up, it should be played continuous while baby sleeps. If you buy a sound machine, make sure it can be run without a timer. You can try it with the timer, but it might not work so well, especially with older babies. Once the machine turns off, baby often wakes up.
I personally prefer a sound machine. I like how portable they are (my family travels a lot) and how easy it is to adjust their volume. Be sure to measure how loud they are as many of them are apparently much louder than 50 dB. For a mid-range price, my new favorite sound machine is the LectroFan (keep in mind that it is not battery operated). For really cheap, I prefer the HoMedics (runs on batteries or via plug and is sometimes glitchy--you get what you pay for).
Box fans are one of the cheapest options. And they are loud enough that your baby won't even know you've just had the neighborhood over for a party. But they can make baby cold and aren't the most convenient to port around to the babysitters. I keep one of these on hand as a back up for when we have lots of people over.
Overhead fans. My overhead fans aren't loud enough to make much noise, but the ones I grew up with sounded like an airplane. If you're using a fan, you can also potentially reduce your child's SIDS risk.
Static radio is a favorite of many people. Obviously it has the benefit of being free. The sound has always irritated me and I have a hard time finding a station with no interference (outside of the static!) so it isn't my personal first choice.
Your own voice shushing (not recommended as your only method unless you want to pass out after 10 minutes!)
Humidifiers. The ones with fans aren't especially loud for newborns, but they work well for some young babies and many older children.
Youtube has some white noise you can play. And you can of course find plenty of apps with white noise.
Hi! We've used a noise machine since day one with our 6 month old. I think it's a Brookstone one from the 90's that was given to us before he was born (for free... a big plus). I have to admit, I don't know if it actually 'works', or if Matty is just a sound sleeper. In fact, lately I've been afraid of using it... he's going through his 6th month growth spurt, and a part of me thought/thinks that the noise will further wake him if he wakes up. Before this growth spurt started, he was almost sleeping through the night without the noise machine and able to soothe himself back to sleep. Should I start using it again through the night until the spurt subsides? On a similar note, I've NEVER used it during his naps, which are usually 45 minutes... I wonder if it'll help him take longer naps?
I doubt the noise will wake him up more when he wakes. His ears have been hearing it as he sleeps so it'll just be a continuation of the noise. In fact, many kids will suddenly wake up if the noise is turned off in the middle of their sleep.
As for naps, it might help. I don't think it could hurt. BUT, many kids that age struggle with short naps so don't be surprised if there is little to no change. Make sure to check out the troubleshooting post on short naps.
My baby sleeps with a stand fan ON... But now since the weather is getting colder, my husband worries that there is lot of air in the room which makes it colder for my girl...
She is 10 months old now and has started waking up a few times in the night... My husband thinks this could be one of the reasons.... Not sure if this is the case and if I should the source of white noise!!!
It's possible she's waking from the cold. You could always try a white noise machine (one that doesn't blow air :) and see what happens.
I don't know your situation, but you can also take a look at the night time sleep post and see if it helps you troubleshoot the night wakings.
That is one cute Camila baby. I know someone that actually just uses an old radio and puts it on static for their white noise and they say it works great!
I think that's my favorite picture of Camilla, Sharon.� So adorable! Yeah, I know lots of people that like the radio noise. Nice and cheap, if you still own a radio! I'm sure our kids will think we're ancient if we own one!
We have used the free WhiteNoise app on an iTouch iPod for our 14 month old for almost his entire life. We keep the volume pretty low just to provide a small amount of ambient noise, but if we have guests over, we turn it up a little in anticipation of voices being carried upstairs. He was a chronic 45 min napper, and the white noise definitely makes a difference helping him transition! I agree and feel like it is similar to a lovey and will be easy to wean him off of in the future :) I love your blog btw...It has been a great source of info for me and my difficult little sleeper! :)
Thanks so much for sharing Nicole, especially about the short naps. I'm so happy you like the blog! It's great to hear feedback from readers.
My son didn't care much for white noise as a baby but he did love the sound our fan made which is similar. I wish there was an iPhone 10 years ago with the app Nicole mentioned in a previous comment!
Jean, one of my children actually seemed irritated by the white noise at first too. He ended up liking it eventually. He's a picky one!� It's amazing how much technology and things with sleep change. They didn't even have a lot of the stuff they have now when my first was born, and he's not quite 5 yet!
with our first baby we tried white noise (vacuum cleaner, hair dryer, laundry machine) and she seemed to calm down for a while.. with second baby there was no time for trying these things :)
Yes, time does get a bit tight the second time around--you have to start using things that don't require so much of your energy!
Hi there! Thanks so much for your great website, I'm a first time mum of a 51/2 month old and it's been a massive help regarding sleep issues. If only babys came with their own manual huh!
One thing I have used for quite some time now is white noise (which happened one night out of desperation!) which I find works great for blocking out all those other outside noises. If it is of help to anyone, I use an old mp3 player sitting on a speaker dock beside bubbys cot and I created a 20 minute 'rain on the roof' sound file that I have on repeat. I made the sound file at this website: http://gomix.it/ which has all sorts of different background noise options for you to use. You can create your own or I think you can download someone elses creation. It was easy, I downloaded it to my laptop and then transferred it over to my mp3 player and it was free when I did it (and hopefully it still is). I hope this is of help to someone looking for white noise files... :o)
Also, my bub hates the vacuum cleaner and the hair dryer. The vacuum cleaner made her fall asleep for the first few months but now they both just upset her terribly, so if one type of white noise doesn't work keep trying other things - e.g. she doesn't mind the 'rain' file I made for her (which I guess is much more soothing!) :o)
We've used a white noise for both of our sons, and will definitely use one for our daughter when she is born in a couple of weeks. I love how it blocks out extra noise. At what point/age, though, do you think a baby stops sleeping through anything? I'd like to try and keep our noise level in our home that same as it's been, since that's what she's been used to all 9 months in my belly :o) But I'm thinking that at a certain point it's good to try and keep my other two a bit quieter around her room, as well as keep other noises to a minimum (vacuuming, etc). Any thoughts?
It depends on the baby when they'll stop sleeping through things. With my youngest, he never slept through any noise. With my oldest, he stopped at about 2 weeks. Most babies seem to be more like 6 weeks -4 months.�
Actually, if you think about it, in the womb, she's used to things sounding like a sound machine with a little outside noise :) �You can try things without the sound machine and see how it goes. In my experience, it isn't worth it. A sound machine helps almost every child sleep better and it isn't a big deal to use. With outside noises (kids etc), just see how baby does. If she's waking from noise, then be more careful about it. Some kids sleep pretty deeply and sound never is an issue.
I like this one because it remembers the last sound you were on and you just have to turn up the volume to turn it on. Very nice and easy to teach grandparents how to use when they come over :) Also has a wide range of sound
I'm sure some of the expensive ones are good (I hear the best things about the Marpacs), but I've had such good luck with cheap ones I haven't felt a need to spend more.
Hi Rachel, at what age can you start using a white noise machine? My 3.5 mo son is a terrible night waker. Bed time is around 7pm and he goes to sleep by himself with no props but around the midnight mark (and sometimes earlier!) the night wakings start. I usually wait at least 5 minutes before going in and using a pacifier. He will then usually sleep for another hour or two until 1.30/2am, before I will then b.feed him. He feeds well, goes back to sleep but more often than not is up again within 1-1.5 hours, insert the paci, down another 1-1.5 hours and then wakes at 7am. I'm going nuts with this and don't understand why he can't self settle through sleep transitions when he can put himself to sleep just fine and wonder if maybe a white noise machine might help? Many thanks, Karen.
Karen, you can start white noise at any age, but I usually start it when a baby is a newborn. White nose may help some, but it sounds like you've got a sleep prop issue going on-- meaning you and the pacifier have turned into sleep props. Many kids will be ok if they can put themselves to bed initially, but not all. You are one of the unlucky ones ;)
napper and sleeper. Is it too late to try white noise with her since I haven't done it since day one?
I don't think it's too late to try white noise. I'd probably start with it pretty quiet then make it a touch louder. And I'd turn it on during your sleep routine so she has time to get used to it with you in her presence.
I use an app on my ipad called relax melodies. It allows you to combine different types of white noise to find the perfect noise for your baby to fall asleep too. I used to use a radio set to static, but there would be the occasional crackle that would disrupt sleep. I also have it downloaded on my phone for emergency naps :D
Thanks for the info Kaye Nicol! I'm not a huge radio static person either, I've never had luck finding a static channel that was consistently smooth.
Love the white noise app for iPhone! Used it for every nap and night with my son. It's easy to wean off of--just reduce the volume by one notch every few days until at the desired level. Later we switched to a small fan. White noise makes a great portable sleep cue. Perfect for traveling, the car, and any naps in different places. Provides something familiar. My baby can be inconsolable in every other way but will calm instantly whenever I turn it on, LOUD! Then when he is calm I can slowly reduce the noise. He also will not take a pacifier until the white noise is on. Then he will soothe.
What are your thoughts on TV in the background? The tv is usually on from 10pm-2am in the next room over and the sound bleeds through. Does this have deleterious effect on sleep quality? Thanks!
If baby seems to not be woken up or distracted by it then I'm guessing it is fine. I think it would be equivalent to just hearing people talk in the background.
Thanks for writing this! I have a question that I can't seem to find any answers with. My siblings were also raised with white noise, although I'm not sure when we all were started on it. It also just so happens that I'm a very light sleeper. So I'm wondering if you know of any association between growing up with white noise and being a light sleeper.
My wife on the other hand, can sleep through anything. She grew up in a family who believed you should let your kids sleep through loud noise so they "get used to it," which, as you say here, probably isn't worth it because it's highly unlikely and has little benefit. Although my wife agrees there's probably no association, my inlaws insist we DON'T use white noise so they get used to it.
So again, do you know of any studies showing an association between noise levels and being a heavy sleeper?
I can't recall of ever reading a study that links white noise to light sleepers, although I bet you'd find more light sleepers using white noise because it helps them sleep (the questions is, which came first, the light sleep or the white noise??).
Looking at my own children and others, they seem to get used to white noise, but they also get unused to it too. When it is no longer used when they get older they do fine without it.
I personally have only rarely slept with white noise but I sleep much better whenever I use it (as do many adults). There are also some adults that sleep much worse with it. I know of some very adult dependent white noise sleepers, but the ones I know of personally have started white noise as adults bc it helped them sleep better. I'm sure there are some who have had it since a child. Once again, I don't know if the white noise is the cause of sleep issues, or if they already had them and the white noise helped.
I grew up in a family of 12, sharing a room with three other people for much of that time. I am not a light sleeper, but I am not a heavy sleeper either. It's possible I have gotten used to sleeping without lots of noise as an adult, although I do remember having a hard time falling asleep sometimes when I was young because a sibling would be talking or something. Thinking about each of my siblings, some seem to sleep deeper than others, even though we grew up in the same environment (for the most part, we were each a year apart so it was pretty consistent for each of us).
Anyway, I've left you with no good answer! My guess is that it just depends. And I still choose white to make happy sleeping children!
I run it for every nap on an old iPhone connected to some speakers. And, I bring it with me on my iPad. It has never failed me.
The best thing about it is that it has three sound modes (one for soothing, one for blocking out sound, and another for regular use) and if you change a mode it slowly transitions so it won’t wake the baby.
We have one of these, which has volume control and 10 different white noise sounds, so you can find the right setting for any environment.
We use it for ourselves and our grandkids when they're over for a visit. Works really well for adults and kids alike.
We are trying a white noise as well. Our daughter was an awesome 10 to 12 hour night sleeper until last week. We tried the dohm fan and the white sheep as they were gift but they were too low. My daughter has a really loud cry and those were not loud enough. I heard they should
Be louder then her cries. I decided to invest in a brooks time one since she seems to be picky and I can experiment with different sounds. The stream seems to work well this evening. The battery died and she woke up. I am trying now with the plug left in . Lol lets see what happens in the next few day
Good luck Adriana. I hope you find something that works. You can always turn it up while she falls asleep then turn it down a bit after she is fast asleep and no longer crying.
My husband and I just tried introducing white noise to our daughter last night, and it has changed my life. She is almost 3 months and sleeps in a bassinet next to our bed.
We had been struggling to get her to go to sleep (I think she wanted to interact with us). The white noise (found in youtube) has helped both of us sleep better and the information you provide has helped to make me feel comfortable using it. Thanks!!!
Awesome to hear mama to q. I noticed my oldest sleeping better whenever the heater turned on shortly after he was born and I went out and got a white noise machine the next day! So great when such a simple thing helps with baby's sleep.
I am weaning my 5 month old off the dummy. It's really hard and there is a lot of crying. White noise is the only thing that settles him but is this a mistake? Am I swapping one sleep prop for another? When will I stop using the white noise? Surely he will keep waking in the night wanting the white noise which is just as bad as the dummy. Also won't he get used to the white noise and immune to it? Help!
I personally don't think white noise is bad to use. I highly recommend it. You turn it on when baby goes to sleep and that is it. No replacing it etc. If you go somewhere, use your phone or bring a machine with you (you have to bring a bed and blankets etc with you anyway, white noise is just a part of their sleep environment). Just my opinion :)

Around seven months back, in November, this column had advised equity mutual fund investors to get out of schemes that had not been doing well. The logic was that the market was booming and so MF schemes should deliver superior returns when the party is on.
Well, it is once again time to review one’s equity MF schemes and shift out of under-performing ones. Never worry about the management fee involved in churning one’s portfolio. Exit and entry loads would hit the capital, but in the anxiety to save 2 per cent money, one may end up losing more money if corrective steps are not taken.
A review of schemes has become necessary for various reasons. First, a restructuring of mid-cap and small-cap mutual fund schemes have happened because of a new, well-defined explanation of what can be called a mid-cap or small-cap stock—based on their market capitalisation—by the market regulator, the Securities and Exchange Board of India.
This has forced many mutual funds to sell large-cap and mid-cap stocks they were having in their small-cap schemes. Large-caps probably had helped these schemes to outperform even when the market was falling.
On the face of it, such schemes looked like small-cap schemes but in reality they were large-cap schemes. While there is nothing wrong in saving the wealth of investors, having a mid-cap stock or large-cap stock in the small-cap scheme amounts to mis-selling a mutual fund scheme. For, when small-caps do well in the market, this particular scheme may not be doing well.
Now that the restructuring is done and dusted, a mid-cap scheme now is a representative of what it should have been in the past. After the clean-up, it is time to check which scheme or fund manager has done well. After ascertaining this, an investor may decide whether or not to stay with a scheme.
The second reason is that despite the market seeing a corrective phase, the money flow into equity mutual funds has not come down much. Of course, in the last six months, some months did see a dip in fund flow, but that was largely over technical reasons like tightening of liquidity close to the financial-year ending. Net of outflows, as much as Rs 24,480 crore has flown into equity funds in the last two months, during April-May. That means retail investors are still increasing their exposure to the equity market.
If this trend persists, probably two years down the line the net asset value (NAV) of mutual fund schemes would be on the display boards of bourses, much like the ticker on stocks. When massive money flows into any asset, bubbles too will develop. So, it is all the more important for investors to review the performance of their equity schemes at regular interval.
A third reason is that since the market has corrected for over four months now, the stocks with relatively less weight in different indices have suffered higher damages than the heavyweights. This calls for comparing the fund performance against three distinct variables: the market as a whole; the index taken as benchmark for the scheme; and peer schemes.
This will show how the fund manager has weathered the corrective phase. Has his scheme outperformed or underperformed the benchmark index? If not, never buy the argument that mutual fund investments are for the long-term and so a short-term aberration in performance should be ignored by investors. This is bunkum. No investment principle prohibits a scheme from good performance in the short-term and long-term. Rather, if a fund has been performing badly in the short-term, the chances of it performing well in the long-term is remote.
A periodic review is essential from another aspect. When regular investment is being made through systematic investment plans (SIP), it is important for the investor to ensure that he is putting his money in the right scheme. Otherwise, one would end up investing in a wrong scheme and compound the mistake month after month.
The first simple step in reviewing a scheme is to check how the benchmark index linked to the scheme has performed. Since the market is going through correction, compare the decline in the benchmark with the schemes net asset value (NAV).
To illustrate, let us take the BSE Small-Cap Index, which has a reasonable number of stocks as constituents. This means the fund manager has a good set of stocks to choose among. The index has corrected 18.10 per cent from the all-time high of 20,183 points it touched on 15 December 2017 to a low of 16,528 points on 21 June 2018. The easiest thing an investor can do is to compare the scheme’s NAV on December 15 and on June 21. If the decline in NAV is more than 18.10 per cent, the scheme should be kept on the watch list, and observe how it performs over the next two months. Give the flexibility of another 7 per cent to the fund manager. Do not dump the scheme even if it has lost 25 per cent of its NAV. Maybe, some stocks in that scheme have fallen more drastically than anticipated. Any scheme that had stocks like Manpasand Beverages is bound to take a bigger hit than the index. But that shouldn’t be cause for worry. Such accidents do happen in the small- and mid-cap space. But if the scheme has lost more than 25 per cent, that should call into question the fund manager’s ability to steer the scheme.
Also, if a scheme is under-performing badly in a bearish market, it would require greater bullishness in market conditions to make up for the loss and give a better return than the benchmark index. An actively managed fund should give better returns than the benchmark. If the scheme is giving returns equal to the benchmark, what is the point? It is better for an investor to shift to an exchange traded fund (ETF) based on the same benchmark and save on fund management fee.
The review of schemes and their shuffling is ideally the job of a professional mutual fund advisor. But the hard fact is that in India, we don’t have a structure where advisors keep the interests of their clients as a sacred priority. They are more keen to sell a new scheme to the investor than shuffling his schemes to ensure optimum return. So, investors have to be on their own and do the math themselves.
The steep correction in mid- and small-cap stocks over the last six months has significantly brought down valuation premia of the segments over the Nifty-50.

Buenos días! Parece que el tiempo nos ha dado una tregua esta semana y por lo menos donde yo vivo, hemos vuelto a ver el sol. No era ese el caso del día en el que sacamos estas fotos, hacía bastante frío y se escapaban gotas y ya dicen que la cara es el espejo del alma... jjaa pues eso.. que estaba congelada!! Pero antes muerta que sencilla, así que a sufrir un poco y nos fuimos a pasear por el pueblo.
Because the cartilage in children’s ears is soft it is more pliable and can be more easily reshaped, otoplasty achieves the best results when performed on children between the ages of four (when the ears are fully formed) and 14. Having the surgery done at a young age can also avoid the associated low self-esteem and self-consciousness that can come as a result as being teased at school. Cosmetic ear surgery is also an excellent option for adults who suffer from large, protruding ears or stretched earlobes however.
If you are unhappy with the way your ears look then the best way to find out if you are a suitable candidate for cosmetic ear surgery is to book a consultation with a surgeon.
If you suffer from severe ear deformities or your ears have been damaged during an accident or because of playing certain sports then you may need reconstructive ear surgery, which is a more complex procedure than traditional otoplasty, and will require longer preparation and recovery time.
Although cosmetic ear surgery is known to be one of the safest plastic surgery procedures, there is always some risk involved in the whenever you have surgery. Infection, blood clots, over correction, and an extremely rare risk of altered hearing are all potential complications associated with ear surgery. If you are having the procedure done under general anesthetic this carries an additional risk.
Infection is one of the most common complications of any surgery. Usually an infection can be treated with antibiotics but in rare cases the infection may require surgical drainage and could result in the formation of scar tissue.
Blood clots are very rare but can be removed with a needle or may simply dissolve naturally. You should contact your surgeon immediately if you experience any prolonged swelling and bleeding to ensure the ear is healing properly.
Over correction is another possible risk following cosmetic ear surgery. The chance of this occurring can be reduced by ensuring you choose a surgeon who is skilled in performing ear surgery. Over correction complications include the surgeon placing the ears too close to the head, contour distortions, inadequate correction, and asymmetric correction.
Hearing loss is extremely rare and a highly skilled ear surgeon is able to evaluate the possibility of such a risk and take the necessary steps to avoid any hearing damage.
Before you decide whether or not to go ahead with cosmetic ear surgery you will need to book a consultation with a surgeon to discuss your options. The surgeon will examine your ears and discuss the type of ear surgery that is best suited to you. The consultation will also be an opportunity for you to talk about your goals and expectations of the procedure.
The surgeon will take a medical history and go through the possible risks and complications associated with the surgery to ensure you fully understand what the procedure involves before making a decision whether or not to go ahead.
Don’t be afraid to ask any questions and bring up any concerns you have. It is also a good idea to ask the surgeon to show you before and after pictures of other patients they have treated so you can get an idea of the previous work they have done.
Once you have decided that you definitely want to go ahead you will be given a consent form to sign. Make sure you read this and all the associated material you are given carefully.
The surgeon will usually take photographs of your ears before you have surgery in order to make a comparison afterwards.
There are different types of surgery for ear correction, so the time your surgery will take depends on which type you are having. Typically, the procedure will take between one and three hours and will be done under local anesthetic or sedation although it is sometimes done under general anesthetic, particularly when the surgery is being done on children.
The technique your surgeon uses will depend on the type of ear surgery you are having but they usually begin by making a small incision behind the ear to reveal the cartilage. They will then remove any excess skin and cartilage before pinning the ear back with stitches. The original incision will then be closed using dissolvable stitches and bandages will be wrapped around the head to cover the ears.
As with any type of surgery, recovery from cosmetic ear surgery can take a few weeks however it is one of the easiest cosmetic surgery procedures to recover from.
You will usually be able to resume normal activities after a few days but full recovery can take up to six weeks. Children generally require a week of rest before going back to school.
Your ears will be swollen after surgery but this will go down after a few days. Your ears may also be bruised and you may get some throbbing, itching or temporary numbness in the treated area.
Once the bandages are removed, after a week or so, the results of the surgery will be immediately visible. It is very important however that you don’t remove the bandages before your surgeon tells you to. You may be required to wear a headband after your bandages are removed to ensure they heal properly and keep the desired shape and position, it is important that you wear this as instructed by your surgeon, especially at night when the ears are most at risk.
You should refrain for any rigorous activity until you are fully recovered and avoid using hair dryers or other objects that give out extreme heat or cold, as they may cause damage to numb ears.
For the fashionistas around the globe, buying different designer dresses can be a huge turn on! And everyone knows, it is always better to shop online when it comes to buying beautiful designer dresses. Not only because you get it for a reasonable price, but also because most of these designer dresses aren’t available in the brick-and-mortar shops in the market.
However, on one hand, shopping for designer dresses becomes a breeze over the internet, and on the other, it can turn out to be a disaster if you do not keep a few important things in mind. Just to make sure you can buy the best and the most beautiful designer dresses Melbourne, here are a few tips you to follow –
Choose a Reputed Seller – It is always better to choose a reputed online seller who has been in the business for a long time. A reputable seller can be trusted, and the best thing is that you will always know they are not going to disappoint you if you happen to have any issue with the product. The seller, who has a good reputation, is also likely to have a good customer service in place to help you with any trouble that you might be facing.
Keep A Specific Designer Or A Brand In Mind – It is okay if you want a dress just to fill up an empty corner of your wardrobe, but if you really want it for some special occasion or to get complimented for, it would be wise of you to keep a designer or a brand name in mind before you actually purchase anything. This way, you will not feel confused and will be able to narrow down your choices better.
Know the Proper Measurements – What is of utmost importance is to look great! But you cannot, if the dress is too tight or too lose on you. You need to make sure that the dress fits you properly and for that, you must know your measurements. Before you buy that beautiful dress that you have just fallen in love with, you should measure your vital statistics properly. However, most of the times, women make this mistake of thinking that they have the same measurements they had two months back. Well, that may not be true. Your body keeps on changing, so it is better to keep a track.
Read the Reviews – No matter how good a dress looks on the e-store’s display, you should not get swept away by its looks. Rather, you should read the customer reviews provided against the dress to be sure. The reviews will help you be certain about the quality of the dress. After all, these reviews are directly from people who have purchased and tried it. Scan through the comments on the dress about the size fit, material quality and the color. This will definitely help you a lot while deciding on which dress to buy.
Go Through All The Return/Exchange/Money Back Policy Of The Site – Before you click on that “buy now” button, make sure you have read all the return/exchange/money back policy thoroughly apart from the delivery and shipping rules. You do not want to get stuck with a seller who doesn’t provide proper guidance after you make a purchase; do you?
Buying designer clothes is a good experience, but ascertaining you have not made any mistakes in the process, makes it even better. Keep the above mentioned tips in mind the next time you are making an online purchase for a dress.

“Don’t judge a book by its cover.” This is definitely not true for ‘Face’ book. Here first impressions are the last impressions. It doesn’t matter whether you have a business page or a profile account- cover photo is the first thing that viewers see when they visit your page. You have a great chance pulling in a lot of ‘Follows’ or ‘Likes’ if your cover photo is something that others just can’t take their eyes off. But that is easier…

It started weeks before I boarded the mountain train. I was on the phone with my mom talking about Christmas break and the typical question came up “So…what do you want for Christmas?” I had always dreamed of taking my own adventure someday and I felt like the time was now. So I asked for a train ticket and an air bnb room in the mountains. It was not the typical gift, but my mom got just as excited as I did and said the experience I will get from this trip will last a lifetime. So the plans started forming…
Before I knew it It was 5:00 am and time to get out of bed to catch the first bus. I was so excited to know the day had come to have my adventure. The adventurous side of me often got squashed by my fragile health but today I was thanking God that I actually felt good. A big part of me wanted to find out what I can do and who I really was at this point in my life. I’m only 22 but I have gone through a lot with the ups and down of a chronic illness. I felt like God was tugging at my heart asking me to do something spontaneous and be ok with no knowing what comes next.
I took a few buses to get from Boulder to the Union station and it was quite fun hauling around a weekend bag through the big Denver city. God has a lot of fun things planned for me. The first was my train buddy. This 80 something year old grandpa who shared his story about life and his perseverance through a hurricane and his wife death and how he never lost his faith. I really do love getting to know older people because they have so much wisdom to share.
As the train slowly chugged up the mountain, my jaw started to drop out of awe and amazement. God created these mountains and the closer I got to the top, the closer I felt to Him. After the 10 minute long tunnel the view was pure white. Snow was piled high in Fraser and as I stepped of the train, I felt the cold pass me by. It was awesome because I love the cold. The snow was exactly what I needed too because Boulder was still sunny and warm. I was craving a cold snowy adventure. I quickly looked at my list of what I wanted to do up here in the mountains. Here is what I wrote: 1.) have a spontaneous adventure 2.) try something new 3.) make a snow angel 4.) make friends with random people 5.) listen to God’s voice 6.) eat snow
I was dropped off the train at the “station” which was basically an outdoor platform. I never considered a bus from the platform to the air bnb because I wanted the adventure of the mile walk in the snow…with my suitcase. Little did I know, the sidewalks were piled with snow so I ended up dragging my suitcase in the snow. I took a few stops to unload all the snow gear and put it on, to make the bag lighter. I’m sure people were wondering where exactly I was going. But the big question was.. did I know where I was going?
Eventually I made it and ended up getting a 5 second ride form a handy man up the very steep hill to the airbnb lodge. He wanted so badly to help, so I let him (don’t worry he looked like a nice stranger!) and he gave me a high five as I got out of the car. This little act of kindness gave me the security that this town was sincere and friendly, which indeed it is.
I was exhausted and took a nap right as I got in the door. Oh, but before that I found a spoon and bowl and filled it up with fresh snow to eat. Then when I woke up, it was time for exploring and finding food so I walked to the grocery store down the road and decided to pick up some things for the weekend. I got to know the friendly air bob hosts. The husband and wife showed me around the kitchen and made me feel very at home. They thought it was quite funny when they found out I ate snow. They told me they normally hand wash dishes and I turned around and quietly unloaded my bowl and spoon from the dishwasher. They asked if I ate dinner and I said “kinda…it was actually a bowl of snow.” They broke out laughing but I guess it was not they typical first meal their guests eat :). I decided to go to bed semi-early so I could wake up for church feeling refreshed. The snow was just starting to fall and I excited for the morning.
I woke up to big thumps on the roof. The snow was getting heavy and sliding off the roof. Kinda a fun way to wake up. The first thing I noticed was how clean mountain air is (It felt so good to breath!).
So sometimes there are those people you meet in life that really make an impression on your life. I got to spend the pink Sunday (the 3rd Sunday of Advent) with the best Catholics in the Mountains. A friend picked me up and we ended up driving to get another young guy and girl. We are all about the same age and share the same faith so it was really fun to talk and get to know each other.
As we entered the beautiful church of Our Lady of the Snow and found our pew, the priest opens the confessional door with a young girl fainted in his arms. I had met this priest when I came to this town with my mom on our little trip to this mountain town a few months before. It was a simple look as he darted his eyes to our pew that he wanted our help. I offer water to the young girl as my friend checks her pulse. Her mom runs through the door to see what is going on with her daughter. It ended up being little bit of dehydration.
I remember the mom looking up at me and asking “who are you?” This moment was imprinted in my memory because it was a question I have been asking myself for a while and partly the reason why I wanted this adventure…to understand better the person God is forming me into. I explained I am visiting from Boulder and my friend goes to this church. But that question really got me thinking inside about how God is shaping me.
Yet you, LORD, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand. ~Isaiah 64:8
Community is a foundation of daily life. It’s not that I have not found great people in Boulder, but I feel like I’m searching for my community still. This unsettled feeling is God trying to tell me to push a little further and keep seeking until I find the people He wants me to be surrounded by. This small mountain parish gave me a glimpse of Gods Love.
People need each other and there is no way around it. I sometimes try to force myself to be ok in certain situations, a big one is feeling lonely in a new environment. I crave a familiar face or a voice but all that is familiar is back in Minnesota. A phone call to family helps, but I know Gods is opening a door in my life to new people and opportunities.
The rest of the day was filled with witnessing unexpected goodness of these new Catholic friends. Its always a relief to be sitting around people where you can watch a movie about John Paul 2, talk about God, your favorite saints, pray the rosary and listen to Catholic music. Allowing God into your day is so natural and fulfilling when you are surrounded by people who Love God with all their heart and mind. The 4 of us made a fun breakfast together, did random walks in the snow, and I even got my snow angel in :).
One memorable thing was pulling out a rope rosary I had been carrying around with me for 2 weeks. I had a feeling I was going to give it away to someone and it was one of the young Catholic guys I met that weekend. He is discerning the priesthood and liked to say the rosary. So I found it fitting and he could wear it on his wrist like I saw my brother and friends back at home do. I like how God prepares us in random ways like that.
I find that true friends help each other grow in their faith. It does not always matter how long you know the person or even how much you know about them. Sometimes you just get the opportunity to be friends easily and conversation comes naturally. Those are the friendships and people God had planned from the beginning.
The 3rd day (Monday) was a strange day. I felt like I had not gotten closure to the questions in my heart. I walked around the town and got some coffee. But the day felt empty. I was scheduled to board the train at 5:00 and honestly I didn’t want to leave because I think I fell in love with the mountain town. I decided to meet my friend before he had to go to work. I had no idea I was in for a hike in the deep snow, but its exactly what was missing from my adventure.
It was a bit of a struggle, one foot off the path and you got buried up to your thigh in cold fluffy snow. So this is what hiking in snow was like! I was stepping in deep snow and taking the plunge and risk of freezing my toes off. But I didn’t care really about being cold. All I wanted was to hear Gods answers to the questions I had holding inside. It was silent so I just kept walking.
Thats how life is sometimes. You just have to keep walking, one step at a time. It may be a desert you are walking in, or a rainforest or on a beach. But for me, its stepping in deep snow. Blindness to if the step in front of me will lead me to get buried in snow or if I will actually keep my balance. A friend walking behind making sure I don’t freeze me toes off helps too.
I willingly jumped on a train to lead me here. I opened my heart to the unexpected. Why? Because honestly I felt like I was running from something inside. I wanted to find out what and I wanted to let God dig me out of the snow and reach out his hand. It was time I let go and trust God.
As I fell over and over again into the deep snow, the fear of sinking slipped away. Before now I was very scared of the deepness of life. I was scared of more pain. I avoiding making mistakes. But all of this blocked off the love God was trying to place into my life. He was coming for me, wherever I was going.
Stepping into the deep can be scary but fun too. There is joy in getting buried in snow even if the cold stings. Sometimes we can’t hear God, but we can only see and experience what He is doing in our lives.
I left Fraser ready to start a new chapter of my life. I was ready to accept any pain and deepness in front of me. But I was also ready to experience joy in every step I take. I knew I needed to trust God would bring me good catholic friends (close by) to guide my step or simply walk along side of me, because we are not meant to live life alone.
Life is about sharing Gods love. Having joy and willingness to help guide our friends on the path to God and also let them help us too, is the best gift.
So a week goes by and I repack to leave for Minnesota. I was a bit nervous going back home for the first time since I moved here. So much has changed, but it was time to get on that plane to go meet my family back home for Christmas. The trip was filled with love from my siblings, parents, friends, and Coopers slobbers and hair. It was exactly what I needed. A big dose of love and support. Only pictures can describe how fulfilling this trip was.
I did not know that my leaving the hometown of Minnesota can become the source of talk among families. I honestly don’t mind people talking because its a good story. “A sick young Caroline gets better and decides to follow Gods will and leave to the mountain state. Not knowing anyone or even any street but the call in her heart got her on her feet.”
I do miss my big snuggle bug. I got used to sleeping with orange rubber toys and waking up with dried up slobber on my face. I found myself sneaking into my sisters room to snuggle up next to them at night. I sat at the top of the stairs listening to my parents conversations as they cleaned up the kitchen. As much as I dreaded the drilling/pounding for the kitchen lights, stove, countertops, faucets, etc. (aka project make-lunger-kitchen-the-heart-of-the-home), I eagerly awaited seeing the handy men from my church that I grew up at. I cherished the familiar voices, the many hugs and kisses and the cold winter icy snow and the howling wind across the Minnesota lake. The nonstop dinner conversations and banana split therapy for a down day are only a glimpse into the love my family has for each other. Never before have I appreciated home as much.
I knew it was going to be hard to leave, but remembering that God brought me to Colorado gave me the reassurance that I will survive once I got back. It took a lot of willpower to convince myself I will be OK. Knowing I had no family or good friends waiting for me, gave me a feeling of emptiness. I did not realize this emptiness was being filled with sadness instead of joy and excitement for new opportunities.
God has allowed this emptiness and I decided it will only be filled with His Love. All I needed to do was lift up my eyes to Him and reach out my hand. Trust.
I got to the Denver airport exhausted and feeling like I left something. The feeling was very truthful becasue I did leave something behind me. I cleared away any lie that I had told the person I used to be when I was very sick. I had shown my home town its possible to change, its possible to do the impossible if God is your guide.
My childhood friend in Minnesota told me that every hardship I have endured while living in Colorado was necessary and it ultimately got me to the path that God has planned for me. It’s here, and I feel it with all my heart, but the feeling is emptiness. It’s emptiness that is going to only be filled with Gods plans for my life that only He knows right now. What’s left for me to do, is be patient and keep walking in the deep snow, unafraid of sinking. I have learned that control only fills the heart with sadness and fear. Emptiness can be scary but it can be so good.
Feeling broken is ok. Its part of Gods plan to rebuild us. Stepping in the deep snow and doing what I am scared of, breaks down the walls of lies and fears of the past. Something is needed to break the cycle for each and everyone of us. We all get weary and need a friend to walk along side of us, and its ok to sometimes reach your hand out so they can pull us out the deep snow when we fall off the path.
Not much time has gone by and I am already seeing Gods love fill this emptiness I once thought was bad. Catholic families I never knew before have let me care for their kids. Being a nanny and caring for Gods children gives me joy. Each day something new happens and you have to tackle it right on the spot.
I don’t fear being lonely anymore but instead I pray for the people in my life and the people I will meet in the future. I want to show them that once they are broken down and have that hole of emptiness, it can be filled, but only with Gods love. Even if its only a smile, the light inside of them has been lit.
A person once told me that when I feel unsettled, its God trying to speak to us so we do something about it. Peace is what God wants for us and its what we should seek. We should not settle but always seek for a true and honest life.
It was about 5:00pm mountain time and I was watching the horizon as I got closer to Boulder. I was tried from the long day of travel and was already missing home. I was lacking courage. But a glimpse of the snow filled mountains lit me heart of fire once agin. I took a deep breath, it will all be ok. I forgot that feeling and instantly the emptiness inside was filled with hope and courage. God speaks to each of us in different ways and he was speaking to me at that very moment.
Deep snow is beautiful because its there that I find Gods helping hand waiting for me. It’s in the deep snow I find happiness.
“It is Jesus that you seek when you dream of happiness; He is waiting for you when nothing else you find satisfies you; He is the beauty to which you are so attracted; it is He who provoked you with that thirst for fullness that will not let you settle for compromise; it is He who urges you to shed the masks of a false life; it is He who reads in your heart your most genuine choices, the choices that others try to stifle.
It is Jesus who stirs in you the desire to do something great with your lives, the will to follow an ideal, the refusal to allow yourselves to be ground down by mediocrity, the courage to commit yourselves humbly and patiently to improving yourselves and society, making the world more human and more fraternal.”
To complete this season of my life in one blog post I want to wrap up a few things. I’m still studying to be a catholic doula. I get antsy on my days off that are set aside for studying so I bounce around on my exercise ball/chair, listening to Audrey Assad, eat spoon fulls of brain food (coconut oil) and sniffle through boxes of tissues (aka 4th sinus infection in 6 months!). So that left me bringing in new Years eve with an unexpected visit to the Dr. and getting prescribed antibiotics and sinus surgery soon to expand my ever beautiful sinus bones that God designed a little too narrow. Please pray for me, I’m a bit nervous.
I met a great Catholic friend who loves saying novenas and also eats paleo. I’m keeping myself occupied nannying cute little ones and enjoying getting dumped in snow this past week in Boulder. I picked my patron saint of 2017- St. Gianna. I find it fitting because this year I am nannying and studying to be a Catholic doula.
God is calling me to live each day and breathe each breath to the fullest. It’s good and I’m thankful.
I caught myself saying one day “If the seasons didn’t change..I don’t think I would change.” Sometimes words just come out of my mouth, but I stopped to think about this for a second. One thing about me…is that I don’t take small steps…I just jump. I like it when one day I wake up and can smell the cold snow and I know the day is going to be very different. I’ll have to take different walks, eat different food, pray different prayers, have different conversations, and so on.
So far it only snowed one day here in Colorado and then it melted a few days later. I guess it snows more in the mountains, but here in Boulder the sun gets pretty warm during the day. As the weeks go by I am finding myself discouraged that the snow will not stay like I am used to. So much has changed since I moved here and sometimes I hold onto consistency and routine, past what is necessary. The priest at my church kindly warned us that if our routine will not eventually lead us to heaven, then it is a dangerous routine.
I remember the day God spoke to my heart and told me it is going to be ok but things had to change. He reminded me that I got through the first “storm” of my life which was recovering from a neurological health condition back in Minnesota. But there is a new season in my life I will not know anything about until I truly open up and start living it. I have to let go of fear of not knowing if I want to fully receive the gifts God has in store for me here. I did not end up in Colorado by accident. Only time will show what I am doing here 🙂
I typically don’t look forward to surprises (I’m getting better at it though!), but I knew God was going to uphold me through any new storm. I’ll never forget the relief I found the weekend my mom and I went on a trip to the mountains. God knew I needed new faces, new scenery, new smiles and most importantly a renewed trust in Him and peace in my heat. The amazing mountains were a sign of God’s greatness, and with Him nothing is impossible. I did not realize my peace was slipping away and my routine I had set up in Boulder was not bearing fruit. It was a hard reality to accept, but that is why breaks are necessary in life- to refocus our life so we can get on the right track
After this mountain trip, it was time to meet my dad at the airport and show my parents the little area of my town that I have started to call “home”. I am seeing how change can bring so much happiness to a family. Space away hurts, but it is also allowing me to grow into the person I am supposed to be. It is taking 1,000 miles away from everything familiar to mold me and shape me into what God wants.
But still, moving across the country and leaving everything I ever knew, was taking a toll even if I did not want to face this reality. It really hit me after family left and I realized that connection is priceless. Getting to share the beauty of the mountains with my mom as we drove up the steep slopes are something I will never forget. There are few people where I can look into their eyes and just simply be myself and be happy. It’s the kind of love we hold onto and will always lean back on when things don’t go right. But for me it was not tangible/reachable anymore, it was only a voice on the phone or a text before bed.
I realized I had this hole in my heart I could not even face to acknowledge…loneliness. It cut me so deep I had a day my hands and head felt numb and all I longed for was a hug, from anyone. My family was 1,000 miles away. The people and places I knew since I was 5 were not reachable. I had taken a jump out here to Colorado because I truly (and still do) feel like God called me here. I had the courage to follow this voice and I never looked back until the loneness became so real. God knows this hurt very well, but He did not want me to seek out a human hug. He wanted me to search for the love that only God can give when our heart has this giant hole. Yeah a hug will still help fill this hole, but everyday through continuous prayer, surrender to Gods will, listening to those who have no-one, and trying to be the light of God in my community is showing me the gift God has given me. He has given me courage to do His will and following God is worth the loneness I am feeling. So now I have hope.
The storm of change started when I was not expecting it to. I thought I had a good plan set up that consisted of nannying, colon hydrotherapy school, and moving into a good location of town . I was biking distance from the colonic school. A bus ride to work. A walk around the road to a good grocery store, coffee shop, bus stop, my chiropractor, a pretty park. It all seemed good.
I remember one day I was lying in my bed in my new room. There was a feeling of comfort, of consistency and of safety beneath my head. God had provided so much and I was thankful for this but something inside told me that the “plan” I had was not His. I instantly got unsettled and asked God to show me, if this was not His plan, then what is? I was battling letting go of my plan and it was a tug-a-war with what I wanted and what God wanted.
I knew my stubbornness was strong and decided to start adding daily prayer in to my routine. I am not sure why I got out of it, but what matters is the now and that I’m trying again. The day I surrendered and asked God for guidance to follow His Will is when it all changed. One thing after another started unwinding, until the whole train of my plans actually fell through. I knew it was time to start a Novena. I scanned several saints and eventually ended up picking the Novena to out Lady Undoer of Knots. I knew I had knots in my life that only prayer could undo…so I started it. During this time I found that my struggles were only going to be fixed with the help of God and I had to listen to his Will. I took many leaps of faith and found that I had to try things and let go of a lot of pain I was holding onto. I learned to trust in Gods safety.
I first got a bad infection that put me in bed for days (still on the weaker side but starting to come back to normal with the help of medicine). Then the family I was nannying decided they don’t need me anymore and I finished my last day with the 2 little girls I absolutely adore. Lastly, after some thought and prayer I decided to change my course of schooling. Something was not looking right about the colon hydrotherapy training and I felt God was intending me to put my effort somewhere else. So yep! My life hit a stand still. Now what? I moved all the way from Minnesota to Colorado to just not know what to do next.
The one place I go to when nothing makes sense is church. I still don’t have many close friends here but I do sure know the priests at my church and they know a lot about me too. I got a feeling of relief when I stepped inside the church, I always do :). I told them my plans had changed and I needed guidance. The prayer “God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can and the Wisdom to know the difference” was literally staring me in the face when I came home and I knew God directed my eyes to this.
So things started to change for the better. My doctor told me my infection needs a month of antibiotics and I started it with no questions. Instead of being very upset and the nanny job ending, I took it as a sign that God has another family in mind for me to care for. It took me longer to get over the change of plans for the colon hydrotherapy school, but I got over the hump. Because of several circumstances, the program was not a good fit anymore. It was not easy to accept that the future I had all lined up was now gone.
Looking back I am thankful God drastically changed my plans, because I am starting to see what He has in store for me instead. Slowly but surly God is shedding light and giving me wisdom to make new plans according to His will.
Through all of this, I found that my true passion is kids and babies. Everything about being a nanny feels right and it’s where God is clearly leading me. I have decided to start a few extra classes to help with getting certified and informed about babies. CPR, first aid, infant massage, and also classes to becoming a Doula! I have thought about being a Doula for years but never considered it until this open door of what felt like “stand still” and “nothingness” opened. Sometimes its in the “nothingness” that God speaks to our hearts.
And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake:
And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
I used to have my whole stack of nutrition books for moms and babies, because ever since high school I found whole foods and nutrition for growing babies and kids to be fascinating. I decided to spend a weekend afternoon at the bookstore looking though the section I once was glued at. It’s funny how life happens and our passions that we once had a young age get buried under everything. For me, I think that having several health conditions stopped me from allowing this dream to be real.
I was a baby that was born at home and grew up with a mom who told stories of my natural childbirth. We shared a love for babies, getting to know pregnant moms, nutrition for kids, and everything in-between. Before I moved out here, I had lined up several meetings with midwives to see if that was something I was interested in. But for some reason, God allowed me to go through this trial to understand that to follow His will, I have to let go of alot inside.
So now I am excited to announce that I am officially training to be a doula! I am still nannying on the side but my focus has changed a bit. I have finally gotten to the point of retaking driving classes (fun times!) because I truly believe I will drive in the near future. Yes my autonomic neuropathy may have caused me to have several health challenges, but I am not longer letting my disease take control of my life. Only God is in control of my life!
Oh, so back to that Novena. On the last day of the Novena (err.. took little longer then 9 days..but thats ok) I remembered God gave me so much hope. Hope of open doors. Confidence that knowing the plans I have in front of me are His plans. Trust in the unknown, the things I can’t grasp or expect will still be good–not only good, but amazing. I am one to be afraid of making wrong mistakes but if I never try, I will never know what lies ahead.
Even though it still has not snowed, I’m ok with it. The new season came today- Advent. I don’t feel that chill in the air, but I do feel a great love from God. After mass there was a visiting priest I went to go meet. He asked if I was a student and I told him my plans about being a doula and that I am a nanny. He had this huge smile and said “You would be a great missionary-we need people like you-people who love babies and kids.” I still don’t know what to think about this, but he went on to say how abundant Gods love is during advent and its a time of change. It is a time to open our hearts and prepare.
I feel like whatever God is shaping me into…He is setting the foundation right now. He is using this time in Boulder to allow me to grow in my faith, gain confidence that I can do anything with Gods strength, and find the gifts He has given me and allow them to bear fruit.
He cuts off every branch of mine that doesn’t produce fruit, and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more. ~John 15:2
When you have apples overflowing in your fruit bowl and some of them are well…too soft eat (because soft apples are never as good as the crunchy ones in my opinion), it’s time to cook something! Stovetop cinnamon apples turn any kind of regular apple into a sweet and healthy treat.
For an easy topping on yogurt or ice-cream its nice to have them cubed up and bite size. I have gone back and fourth cooking whole apples, 1/2 apples, apple slices and now apple “cubes”. It’s fun that apples can be made into a variety of shapes and sizes.
I had my 2 year old helper that I nanny, chop with her plastic knife along side of me. We ended up snacking on the apples that were on the crunchier side because crunchy local apples here in Colorado are amazing!
Stovetop cinnamon apples are a simple recipe for kids to help with too. It is a super easy recipe and can be done in basically 10 min (awesome for short attention spans!). The clean up is minimal but the finished apples are warm and yummy! So here is how you do it.
In a saucepan (I use an amber glass one) add water, salt, cinnamon, butter and maple syrup (optional) and stir to combine.
Let cool for a few minutes and then serve! Leftovers can be saved in the fridge for a few days too. 🙂
Hi! I have been loving fall here in Boulder Colorado. The smell in the air is crisp and the nights are cooler so sweet potato fries really warm you to the bones (exactly what I need right now after a long walk).
Since I’m a nanny during the week, that means I’m in charge of the kids meals. I get to cook with awesome organic farm fresh foods for the family I am nannying. Sweet potatoes, pumpkins, apples.. yum!
In my last post I mentioned I was a live in nanny, but after giving it a try I felt it was not ideal for me. I am still a nanny in the same area but I have more personal space after work which is nice. The little ones I nanny are awesome eaters and love to help me make things from scratch. They love to peel sweet potatoes, separate the pumpkin seeds, and freeze fruits. It’s a good match because it helps the process go quicker, gets them involved and trying new things.
Baked sweet potato fries are a favorite (and a great filling warming food after a long day!). True story… In 6th grade I ate a sweet potato every day after school and it was such a good recovery food mentally and physically. That got me thinking, there must be something good for the brain in sweet potatoes. Time to flip through to the biggest best food nutrition dictionary or the online version. I found that
In animal studies, reduced inflammation following sweet potato consumption has been shown in brain tissue and nerve tissue throughout the body.
Baked sweet potato fries are yummy and easy and such an appetizing way to cook a vegetable (in my opinion). Alrighty, enjoy!
organic cinnamon (sweet) or organic cumin (savory) -both of these spices are great depending on if you want an extra flavor.
Like I said in my last update, my health got better and I took a giant leap of faith to drive across the country MN–>CO to become a live in Nanny for a great Catholic German Family. God has blessed me a thousand times, and am so happy here! Since I make healthy meals each day for the family, I may as well write them out for you to make too!
Just a heads up, this recipe was made up at the last second because we had a lot of extra cooked quinoa and a bunch of school friends coming over in 1 hour. So we brainstormed a bit and decided on something sweet with premade cooked quinoa, caramel and cinnamon!
This recipe is pretty flexible and you could add some baked apples instead of bananas. Feel free to add more or less quinoa depending on how much you have on hand. You could switch almonds for walnuts too. At the end we had extra caramel sauce so the kids just drizzled it over their pieces.
In a large sauce pan combine cooked quinoa, cinnamon, butter, sea salt, and about 1/4 cup of the caramel sauce.
Turn the heat on medium and cook until the butter is melted and the quinoa gets coated with cinnamon and caramel and becomes sticky.
Add walnuts and drizzle the top of the cake with the caramel sauce. (*you will have extra and can save it or drizzle more on later).

I deal with steel reject claims on a daily basis and I recently discovered that a fellow co-worker has been going through my drawers and pulling my claims out. I keep a spreadsheet on my desktop of all the claims that I have put in my drawers for quick reference and I delete them after I put through the claim. Lately I've been noticing that there are claims on my spreadsheet but not in my drawers. I can tell when this co-worker has been in my drawer because he pulls out a whole file and then he'll put it in backwards. From now on I'll have to lock my drawer and take my keys with and I think thats sad. Has anyone else come across this?? Do you have to lock your drawers or shut down your computer so no one else can access your files??? Shouldn't we be able to trust our co-workers??

RCX07-432 : RCX H1304 4000KV Multirotor Brushless Motor for 120-150 Frame (7.5g) [RCX07-432] Review - USD11.99 : MyRcMart.COM : This motor was designed for T-Type 3inch Propeller which is commonly used on 120-150 Quad Frame. It assembled with Imported NMB Bearing and Copper Wire to maintain the quality. It assembled with Imported NMB Bearing and Copper Wire to maintain the quality. The motor has been balanced by Motion Balancing Machine so you will see the colored balancing mud in the motor. There are lots of brands who claimed their motors are balanced but in fact it is only static balanced (this means just to filter the highly imbalanced CNC out), its balancing quality is far away from real Dynamic Balancing. If you do not see the balancing mud inside almost all motors, that means their "balanced" word is just a joke. Be Smart & Buy Smart! Dynamic balancing is the most time consuming part when manufacturing a motor so factories don't like to balance the motors due to saving of labor work. RCX always cannot catch up the supply demand due to this reason (production quantity is limited by the balancing work). If a factory can supply heaps of motors to the market, do you think their motors are balanced well? If RCX does not need to balance the motor, the production would be much faster. Advantages of H1304 over BE1104/BE1105: H1304 has soldered with Soft AWG Cables which is much easier to solder H1304 has much higher thrust and efficiency H1304 has been balanced by motion balancing machine H1304 is just little heavier (about 1.5g) that 1104/1105 motors currently in the market but with much increase in thrust which 1104/1105 cannot give you. H1304 gains you more power without much weight penalty so it is good for who need to meet the restriction (eg. Flying Weight) set by their country. (eg. USA < 250g, Japan < 200g). CNC Material of H1304 is 7075 class which is stronger than most motors in the market. Neat copper wire winding This H1304 motor made with Imported Copper Wire, NMB Bearings, Kawasaki Japan 0.2mm Silicon Steel. LOOK at the blue balancing mud, it is proven that the motor has been balanced by dynamic balancing machine. Light Weight 1104/1105 motors in the market are weight about 6gt. H1304 is weight at about 7.5g which is only 1.5g heavier but it has much higher thrust and efficiency than 1104/1105. So it is really a good trade for the 1.5g weight. T-Type 3inch Propeller Click here to browse all available T-Type 3020 Propellers. Suitable ESC You may use this XM-10A or XM-20A BLHeli ESC for this little high KV/RPM motor. Thrust Test Table We have tested this 4000KV motor with T-Type 3020 Prop with both 2S - 4S. All worked great.

Food is one of the topics studied in 1st Year Primary. Related to this concept, students have learnt words for fruit, vegetables and other types of food through different activities such as songs, board games, playing with flashcards and so on. Moreover, they have carried out one lovely project in which they had an awesome time in class and at home.
This project consisted on selecting one recipe they could cook at home with their parents (salad, Spanish omelette, pizza or pasta). Afterwards, they had to write this recipe in the classroom including ingredients, procedures and some drawings. Finally, they stuck some photos of them cooking or eating the dish and they showed the completed project to their partners.
At first, I didn’t think I’d write about this. I mean, I couldn’t see where I’d done wrong, but I still had a sense of shame.
It’s only after talking about it, a lot, that I realise I’ve done nothing wrong. I’d never wore shorts or swimwear off the beach, I dressed as I’d consider for modest, for being in a hot country.
Despite previous travels ‘solo’ to India, Cambodia, Peru, Thailand and such, I’ve never experienced such disrespect and what felt like danger. Well, except in Egypt, for which I wasn’t surprised.. I doubt this will be the most harrowing thing you’ll read about but, it surprises me how many other women I’ve spoken to were naive to this too. I’m a strong and able woman, have lived in big bad London for 8 years, I can handle travelling alone..?
I didn’t realise before, how in India, my friend Yogesh had saved my innocence by insisting I use his high quality apartment and driver. It was this connection, which kept me safe.
For the most part in Sri Lanka, I was with my best friend, she has the type of eyes which say, ‘don’t fuck with me’; we had each other’s back. We were approached a fair amount, and other than this first situation, no one touched me.
We were at our hotel in Maskeliya, preparing to climb Adam’s peak the next day. We were washing our clothes in the garden when I’d realised there was an obviously more simple minded young man (maybe 26 years old) around us, he appeared to be helping with the building works.
We sit down in the empty dining room for dinner. The boy enters the room too and stands no more than 3 meters from us, staring intently, right at me. We decide to try and ignore him, 10 minutes later, maybe less, I’m bothered. It’s too much, too intense to eat alongside, thus I point this out to the hotelier’s wife. She takes him out, he moves and continues to stare at us from the kitchen.
After dinner my friend goes to smoke at our balcony and I stay to use the WiFi, thinking the boy has gone. After a few minutes he comes towards me as asks for a cigarette, I firmly say no, I don’t smoke. He continues to comes towards me hand reaching out for what I presume to be my waist. I angrily usher him away from me as my back is already in a corner. He laughs and continues to stare menacingly at me, from beneath his brow. He doesn’t back away and tries again to come towards me. I push past him and call for the hotelier to tell him what just happened. The hotelier responded by considering what would happen had his 20 something year old daughter been in my situation; or someone with an overprotective travelling companion. The boy was removed from the hotel.
At first this saddened me to hinder his work opportunity but, it’s only been after talking to other women about this that I realise no matter his problem, it doesn’t excuse him to touch me. Why did it take so long for me to put myself first in this realisation?..
The second incidence, also happened in a hotel. I was travelling with a European man, he had a girlfriend at home but we were keeping each other company for the trip. We stopped at a hotel in Sigiriya for 2 nights whilst we explored the surrounds. The father of the hotel owner, who was catering for us, got wind of my male companion not actually being my partner (I tried to warn him to stay close but clearly neither of us knew the implication of not), I’m not sure for how it is that he then perceived me, but it wasn’t with respect. After breakfast on the second/last morning, my companion left the place we were dining in the owner’s main house, for the bathroom. The hotel man said I had red skin from the sun, and said he’d put some aloe on it. Before this he’d made us special food and drinks as I’d told him that I can’t eat certain foods. I thought I could trust him, like a medicine man. My naivety as to why he might want to touch me, and the fact that I was travelling with a man, put my guard down.
So, he’s putting this fresh aloe on my arms, his hands stinking of onion, yuk! And then his hand went down my dress! I’ll never forget his response when I said “No! I’m not burnt there!” He looked me in the eyes and told me to trust him, told me about how he massages people’s wives naked on his bed, that he’s a medicine man. Man, I’m fucking angry. I didn’t know to stop it, I felt so belittled, confused, and my companion still not back.. The same thing played again but by this time my friend was just arriving back outside the room, I bolted for the door.
This hotel guy then offered to wash our car, had my friend happy and distracted. Suck up, fucking dirty creep! Once we were ready to leave and our large bags loaded into the boot, I was doing a last sweep of the room. The hotel guy came into the room, I felt his intentions were again to see what he could get from me. I shouted to my friend that I was coming and quickly ran to the car. I was still processing what had just happened and knew I was angry but couldn’t quite work out if I had the right to be. Had I had told my friend about this before we left, what would he have done? The sinking feeling I get is that nothing of justice would happen, it seems most men are only protective of their women, not just any woman..? But the thing is, by not having another man challenge him, he’s going to think it’s OK to do this to another hapless Western woman. I’m mainly angry I didn’t realise sooner and punch him in the face!
The third incident, I’m in Negombo, on my own as my travelling partner had left for home. I stayed about 30 minutes drive from the beach and so, get a tuk tuk there from my hotel. I wanted to explore for some nice food and perhaps a massage for my last 2 days. The first restaurant I chose was connected to a big hotel, I had the presumption I could be ‘safe’ in such an establishment. I order a chicken salad and a king coconut (of course!) and am a bit perturbed as I have a crowd of male waiting staff around my table watching me. I ask if they want something, glance my sternest stare and am kind of left alone.
I make for the beach, contemplating if I can play in the sand and make use of the sun rays to nourish my skin. Within minutes again, I’m approached by boys wanting a selfie with me. It is like they’d never seen a blonde woman before..
Following some investigations about my occupation and dinner, I walk to a nearby supermarket to get some supplies. On my way back, 60 meters from the restaurant, I felt a firm hand quickly and strongly grab my ass! The douchebag who did it, was with his friend on a motorbike and nearly crashed into the curb just in front of me. I burst into tears. This was enough!
I had no idea Sri Lanka would be like this. I had no idea I wouldn’t be safe to travel alone. Of course, it doesn’t happen to every solo woman traveller but, it happened, in this fortunately light form, to me.
Men, if you hear or see and do nothing, it makes you as bad as the guys doing something; I can’t begin to explain how I felt when communicating to supportive and unsupportive guys. Ladies, keep safe, open your eyes and your ears; even though it gets easier to travel to ‘exotic’ places, remember there, you are exotic and the media portrays us Western Women appallingly. The picture of Western women put on television in the West let alone what’s aired in the East, makes us seem like easy targets, so don’t reinforce this. It’s going to take generations for culture, and dare I say sexist [racism] to change throughout the world, there’s a lot to be done. We need to be savvy, we need to know our boundaries and we need to, unfortunately still, keep safe and take precautions.
Positive note, I did meet a few younger Sri Lankan guys, one being, Asanka, whose presence helped me a lot! My uncle is from there, I met lots of lovely men and women, everyone told me about the lovely ones. I just wish I was aware to be more careful of the less lovely ones! What I write here is just a snippet of some of the troubles I had, and I feel I was lucky!

As to Homer, (and the bulk of humanity) we cannot be certain how much of the bards' legacy, of the time period you mention, was filtered out, or over-emphasized, by an editorializing, perhaps unconsciously self-indulgent fellow, who created an "Odysseus," and perhaps a tale or two, which may indeed mirror Homer's *natal chart biases* for what-goes-with-what. The repetition of a term like, "Black Ships." for instance, can be both historically correct *and* a personal emphasis of one descriptive detail over another which was equally available, or even a detail which was once more predominant and more traditionally characteristic to the mind of one's predecessors. (For instance who nowadays cares if Scott Fitzgerald was or was not gay?) Another phenomenon which amazes me about people in general is that singers of songs would rather get caught in an act of marital infidelity than be caught being unfaithful to an authoritative traditional lyric...:)
Anyway, due to my experiences I'm guessing that boats and ships, as mental images and sentiments, most often carry the natal Moon's, ah...scent? And, the color black is of course very Saturn linked. Here's the example from me previous post now put to a more collective task. Waterhouse the painter has a natal opposition of Moon and Saturn, like my daughter who finds "herself" in some focal essence(?) of the painting:
The Moon opposite Saturn could very likely be a natal property/quality of whoever Homer is, even he is in fact more like a corporation --some collective creature, which propagates the fingerprint/portrait of some spiritually photographed cosmic moment, an apparently important image with a permanent place of honor in the human family album.
In truth, the only real problem I have at present is the messy business of trying to determine if I am "hearing" the Moon opposite Saturn, or either the Moon conjunct or square Saturn. I do believe Home borrowed much, and kept the original stories' details more or less accurately, because one story will contradict another at times, in terms of what aspects we could say we are "hearing". And, some are uncannily consistent; like men clinging to the belly of the sheep to escape the cave of the Cyclops, and men hidden in the belly of wooden horse to enter Troy. In either case we have giant-ism of some sort involved and an enemy's home as the venue. So could we be hearing natal Jupiter (of both Horses and Giants) in the sign Cancer ? Well, here's an interesting chart possibility:

On April 25, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited Bayview Yards, Ottawa’s Innovation Hub and home to many Canadian startup headquarters – including IDEABOOST Cohort 6 company and 2017 Cultural Start-up Award Winner, MasterpieceVR.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau engaging in a demo with Jonathan Gagne, founder and CEO of MasterpieceVR.
The sole company selected to demo for Prime Minister Trudeau, MasterpieceVR showcased their collaborative VR platform that simplifies 3D sculpting and painting. They surprised Prime Minister Trudeau with a full body sculpt of him as Han Solo, created in less than two hours, as well as a 3D print of this model, printed that same morning.
The fun, engaging demo with Jonathan Gagne, MasterpieceVR’s founder and CEO, illustrated how quickly and accessibly MasterpieceVR generates high quality 3D content, even by artists new to VR/3D.
During his visit, the Prime Minister also met with other entrepreneurs at Bayview Yards, whose programs, services and space itself seek to catalyze startup growth, commercial success and economic impact in a growing Ottawa tech industry – of which MasterpieceVR is a key player. In the past six months, they’ve won a Best Ottawa Business Award for #NextBigThing, were nominated for best Creative App of 2018 by UploadVR, and have recently been nominated for an Auggie Award for Best Creator and Authoring Tool.
In 2017, MasterpieceVR’s parent company, Brinx, participated in the Canadian Film Centre Media Lab’s (CFC Media Lab) IDEABOOST Accelerator as part of Cohort 6. At the Enterprising Culture Forum, MasterpieceVR was the Canadian recipient of the Cultural Start-up Award. This juried competition awards key commercialization opportunities to two companies, one Canadian and one French, for intensive immersion and commercialization activities at, respectively, La Gaîté Lyrique in France, and CFC Media Lab in Canada. The Government of Canada supports CFC IDEABOOST and Enterprising Culture through funding from the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario.
Finally, at the demo, MasterpieceVR also shared their work with Prime Minister Trudeau about an exciting current partnership with Microsoft. The Sustainable City Contest aims to inspire artists around the world to imagine and create a model, by using MasterpieceVR, of an environmentally sustainable city. Deadlines for submissions take place in two phases this month (on May 15 and May 29), so there’s still time to get busy envisioning!
Congratulations to the MasterpieceVR team for their recent awards, partnerships, and ongoing high-quality work in innovative 3D solutions – visit them here to learn more.

At that time there wasn’t an Apple Authorized Service Provider in the area, which meant that you had to send your machine off or drive to Dallas. We didn’t like those options so we created our own.
Our shop might have only started in 2006, but not our Apple love. That started long before. Growing up we had SE’s, LC II’s, iLamps and Quicksilver towers. We were raised recognizing the rainbow apple logo, able to recite the Think Different commercial and have fond memories of watching Pirates of Silicon Valley for the first time. We lived through the clone wars and remember where we were when we heard Jobs had died.

Yesterday I was invited to join some friends visiting the Good Goods trade fair about sustainable consumption here in Hamburg. Next to the usual suspects such as clothing manufacturers, financial services vendors, energy traders, governmental organisations, publishers, food producers and about half a dozen different organic lemonade brands (samples, yeah!), my personal highlight was the tiny booth of PHeFE (de). Phefe is the ambitious project of researcher Susanne Jordan, aiming to create fair (as in fair-trade) alternatives for consumer electronics, starting with a self-designed computer mouse.
Phefe continues where Goliath corporations fail to deliver again and again, to go beyond labelling energy saving and recyclable devices as “Green IT” and make the entire production of electronics a process that respects basic human rights. As an example the documentary Blood in the Mobile illustrates vividly how mining minerals used in mobile phones is directly linked to local wars. But also sweatshop like labour conditions in product assembly lines are very common, with Foxconn (Apple, Asus, Nokia, Sony Ericsson) controversies unfortunately only being the tip of the iceberg.
The fair PC mouse is not yet available for purchase, but production is planned to start in 2011. So look forward to the Phefe mouse becoming what coffee was to fair-trade foods and hopefully initiating a paradigm shift in the consumer electronics sector. I will keep you updated!
Phefe and Blood in the Mobile are supported by Make IT Fair, a campaign by several consumer watchdogs and other NGOs – well worth checking out. Wow, things are happening! 🙂

The Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) is one of the most widely used multiple-aptitude test batteries in the world. It was originally designed to predict success in military occupations and is used today to help both those considering entering the military (mostly high school-aged students, but also anyone who is eligible to enlist) as well as those not interested in military service (who comprise the majority of current ASVAB test takers) what sort of career may be the best fit for them. Scores from the ASVAB can be used when enlisting in the military. Students interested in taking the ASVAB should check with their high school to find out when and if the ASVAB will be offered at their school. If it is not offered, students should meet with their guidance counselor to determine if it is possible to schedule a testing session in the future. There is no cost to take the ASVAB.
Understanding the ASVAB score range is to understand standard deviations. The highest score on the ASVAB is a 99 and the lowest score is a one. Scores are based on the mean of all examinees. This is to say that a score of 50 would account for an average score. Each increment of 10 represents a single standard deviation from the mean score. So, for example, a score of 80 would be three standard deviations better than the meanwhile a score of 30 would be two standard deviations lower than the mean score.
The chicks are fully integrated into the coop. The barrier has been removed, the food and water are outside, the chicks leave the coop during the day and return to perch at night. The first day they all went outdoors, 6 of them perched in the smaller part of the then divided coop with the big girls and only 4 isolated themselves. Now they mix it up on the perches, so fun to see with big and littles all scrunched together.
I was still having some concerns about the king and queen of the coop as the Olive Egger was picking on the chicks and Cogburn without most of his harem was beating up on the two Buff Orpingtons hens. Tonight after coop up time, Jim and I went out and shook up the pecking order a bit. We moved the 3 red sex link laying hens back into the coop and removed the king and queen to the cull pen and chicken tractor. Cogburn will have 4 hens and the coop has 5 hens and the 10 nine week old pullets. Once the pullets are laying and son comes to run freezer camp, Cogburn will likely be returned to the coop and the red sex links may be removed. The Olive Egger only gives us about 3 to 4 eggs a week and though it is fun to find the green eggs, she may go to camp. Maybe by removing her and the roo for a while to allow the Buff Orpington hens some rest and the chicks some time to grow some more, they may both be returned to the coop. That will have stirred up the pecking order and may drop her down a peg or two.
It is still exciting to check the nesting boxes in the evening and bring in 7 to 9 varied eggs. The sale of the extras to my knitting group generally funds my dinner at coffee shop where we gather.
So neat to know you are actually turning a profit from the eggs laid by your chickens. And, who’d ever thought there could be such drama in a hen house? Blessings!

This striking silver mica has the look of actual metallic flakes! A dark, rich silver in coloration, the mica is processed at a super high temperature so that the color is baked right into the flakes and will not rub off. A thin, medium-flaked mica that is relatively even in size, the lustrous glimmer has a truly metallic sheen. Imported from India.
Just about any style of adhesive can be used with mica sparkles, but do note that the type of glue will affect the final color and shine of the flakes. A white glue that dries clear is the best choice for maximum brilliance, while hide glue has an amber-toned hue that adds an aged, antique look to the flakes.

We contacted Lauren and Natasha on a whim after falling in love with a house in Live Oak. They were immediately ready to spring into action and formulate a plan to…
"I highly recommend Lauren. While Lauren’s area of expertise lies in Santa Cruz County she was unafraid of helping me sell the family home in San Jose. Selling my Mother’s home after her passing was a difficult task, but Lauren helped me every step of the way. She helped me make the difficult decisions, made suggestions as to what needed to be done to my Mom’s home in order to have it present better, and she has a vast network of professionals to help with any of the work that needs to be done to the house. Lauren’s extensive knowledge in real estate was reflected in the fact that she knew just how to price the home. Even in the rough real estate market that we are in, the house sold very quickly and we got our asking price. I won’t use any other Real Estate Agent whether it is buying or selling a home."
"Lauren came highly recommended by a family member in the real estate business. We were thoroughly pleased with her throughout the process of buying a home in Santa Cruz. She is very experienced and knows the market in Santa Cruz. We had just had a baby and it was difficult to find time to get to her office, so she came to our apartment countless times. She was always available by phone and e-mail and touched base with us frequently. Lauren was so efficient at getting inspections scheduled and paperwork done that we were able to close escrow early, which saved us money. It's obvious to us that Lauren really cares about finding her clients the house they want and making the process go smoothly. We would highly recommend her!"
"Lauren is both the most professional and personable real estate agent we have ever encountered, and she made the usual agony of house hunting and buying a smooth process. (This is our third.) First, Lauren knows the market and stays on top of all events affecting real estate sales and purchases. But what makes her exceptional is her ability to balance consummate professionalism with warmth and sensitivity. She is always available, always supportive, always helpful. And yet, she is never intrusive or overbearing. I can't say enough positively about her and I'm afraid that if I try it will sound unbelievable. But believe me, Lauren is superb and we recommend her without reservation."
"Lauren Spencer made our experience as first-time home-buyers as straightforward and smooth as possible. In fact, Lauren made it clear to us that no question would be left unanswered, and that she was prepared to search for the house that would prove to be “the right fit”. Once we found the property, which eventually became our home, Lauren proved to be an outstanding advocate, representing us and negotiation contract details in a manner that proved to be composed and firm. Our experience purchasing a home was extremely positive, particularly since we felt that Lauren Spencer was working hard to find just the right place for us, negotiating the contract in our best interest, and making sure that our house became the home we wanted it to be. We whole-heartedly recommend Lauren Spencer as a realtor to any future home-buyer."
"I wanted to thank you for a quick and painless sale of my house. I picked you as my agent out of five that I interviewed, because you listened to what I had to say and responded in a way that showed you heard me. You saved me extra money by enrolling me in a sellers' warranty and provided workers who could work on my house in a timely manner or used the ones that I provided. In all respects you were professional and yet personal. Thanks again."
"Thank you so much for all your help in purchasing our wonderful new home in Santa Cruz. Because we were house hunting from Boston, Massachusetts, it was challenging finding a home that we felt comfortable putting an offer on in a limited amount of time. You were very patient with us as we honed in on neighborhoods we liked. You were also very knowledgeable because all your experience in the Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley areas and helped us learn about appropriate pricing through looking at many similar homes in the same neighborhood. You were friendly but firm during our negotiations and helped us navigate a somewhat unusual situation. Lastly, the list of vendors that you gave us once we bought our home was instrumental in helping us find local roofers, electricians, and other service people, who have been great. We love our new home and thank you for helping us find it!"

A multipurpose sports and convention arena was on its way to construction in 1991 when Dick Devos picked up the phone to call some people to go against the plan. For him, this sports facility would hurt the city of Grand Rapids, especially its downtown area.
He recalled and compared the situation during the time when the Pontiac Silverdome and the Palace of Auburn Hills caused some damage to Detroit after the Pistons and Lions moved to another location back in the 70s. His beliefs led to the creation of a group of business leaders that they called Grand Action.
Two years later, Dick Devos became the CEO of his family’s Amway Corp until 2002. Even before that, he has always been active in attempting to change the face of the policies of labor, education, and other institutions. Together with his wife, the power duo has catalyzed some significant reforms in state laws that influence the paths of employment and learning.
Betsy Devos has been proactively pushing the expansion for educational institutions, especially charter schools. On the other hand, Dick Devos formulated the law that turned Michigan into a supportive area for the right to work in 2012. It was undoubtedly a giant move, considering the state was the birthplace of systematized and controlled labor. The law he engineered allowed union membership to be obliterated as a requirement or condition to be employed.
Just last year, Dick Devos was in the headlines because he was tapped for a prominent position in the Federal Aviation Administration. He is currently assigned to the top civilian panel that has the responsibility to manage and supervise the FAA. He became one of the newest members of the assembly and was formally announced on September last year.
As part of the Management Advisory Council of the FAA, it is his duty, along with the other senior managers, to advise and plan for regulatory, expenses, and policy matters. As a group, they come up with a strategy for how the agency will work and carry out its tasks efficiently.
Dick Devos will serve as a volunteer, just like the other members of the group, for three years. He is expected to keep his positions in both the public and private sectors.
Throughout the years, the Devos family has always had a significant role in turning the education, labor, and even the political landscape. With their influence and experience, Dick and Betsy Devos have led groups to work on various projects for improvement and sometimes, reorganization.
Adam Milstein has his roots in Israel from parents whose backgrounds were different. His mother, Eva Milstein was a homemaker and was a Mexican migrant in 1949. His father, Hillel was a renowned real estate developer and was also an immigrant of Argentina. He went to Israel at 19 when the country was founded. He has been a very instrumental figure to his son and has always worked towards defending the interests of his children. He has been known for his expertise in the real estate businesses.
Adam Milstein joined the Israel Defense Forces in the year 1973 where he was involved at various war fronts. One is the one in 1973 known as the Yom Kippur War. He completed his mandatory service, and that is when he decided to join the famous Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, and by 1978, he had graduated with a bachelors of science degree in Economics and Business. That was his fist stepping stone to career development and advancement. While at School, he joined his father in the journey towards expanding his real estate business. They worked together for sometimes before Adam Milstein married the love of his life in 1974. In the year 1981, they relocated to the United States of America. He immediately joined the University of Southern California where he enrolled for an MBA. He then graduated in 1983. In Los Angeles, he started working as a real estate sales agent, and that is how he began developing a passion for education. With time he became a great real estate mogul.
Adam Milstein after succeeding education journey has been able to move with speed and professionalism towards promoting his career journey. He has been able to open up several companies that have managed to bring him a lot of income in his career. He has also been known for his great efforts towards ensuring that he helps as many people as possible especially from the Jewish community. He has been proudly carrying the tag of a great philanthropist in his journey and people have been able to respect him a lot. He also chairs several boards all of which are aimed at improving the welfare of their people.
Having memories and creating memories is one of the most important aspects of human life. In a life where the next day and the next second is not guaranteed, celebrating an achievement or a milestone life event or just having a nice time, is important just to add flavor in life. However, it is not always easy sailing especially when you want to share the joy with your friends and relatives, because you might not know how to throw a good party.
The hustle and logistics involved in planning a party stresses many people because there is a hub of activities that happen in the background to see to a successful event or party. You can bank on Mina Ebrahimi, proprietor of Saint Germain Catering, to make your event the most colorful, memorable and fun packed ceremony. Mina Ebrahimi has been doing this for the last nineteen years, and she has always exceeded expectations every time she has managed an event. She has a competent team of well-versed individuals and professionals alike, who give their best to ensure an event is the best. One of those parties that invited and uninvited guests alike, don’t want it to end.
Mina Ebrahimi runs her business with a lot of passion and dedication. It is no wonder that her company has achieved success in all the years it has been operational. Mina says that she loves to see people happy and she does all that is possible to this happen. Perhaps it is because she got involved in this line of work from an early age of eleven working in a family bakery called Tiffany’s Bakery. This gave her a strong background, and she would later decide at the age of 26 to start her own venture. Hence, Saint Germain Catering was born in 1999. Her excellent leadership and her loyalty to customers have helped her grow the company into a big event manager. Today she manages private parties, weddings, business luncheons and many more major events.
Her dedication to high standards of business earned her the 2010 Top 40 Under 40 Award. Additionally, she is the recipient of other awards such as 2014 Enterprising Woman of the Year and the Smart CEO Brava Award which she won in 2012.
Mina has a passion for animals and philanthropy and is involved in a series of charities dedicated to animal welfare. In the same spirit, she founded the Jack-Ebrahimi Program at the University of Pennsylvania which offers Interventional Radiology for Veterinary in the Country.
Betsy DeVos decided to let transgender and gay employees who work for the Education Department know, ahead of time, about the fact that President Trump was going to rescind a federal policy that made it ok for transgender students to choose whatever bathroom they wanted to use. While it was reported that she, herself, had been opposed to the ruling, she didn’t let on to the public that she was having any kind of disagreement with Trump. When the policy was officially announced, she was on the scene and spoke to the Conservative Political Action Conference. These events may have led some to believe that she is going to be a weaker part of the administration, but those who come from her home-state of Michigan know that she is a savvy political scrapper who works behind the scenes.
When Betsy DeVos first showed up in Washington, she didn’t have a lot of experience working inside of the government, and she doesn’t really have a history of being involved with President Trump either. Others have pointed out that she has never attended a public school, herself, and that this is true for her children, as well. Those closest to her say none of this really matters, because she will be making new connections and learning how to do her job soon enough. She has had plenty of experience in Michigan, where her husband, Dick DeVos, ran for governor and where she has fought for tax dollars to pay for private school tuition.
Betsy DeVos has, in fact, been working for years to win the approval from the government for tax dollars to be used to pay for vouchers that allow parents to choose the school that their children attend. It has been her mission to enable poor families to have the same choices that wealthier families do in regards to picking out the school that they want their kids to go to.
Along with non-profit private schools, she has also supported the right for tax dollars to be used for for-profit private schools. In Detroit, her hard work has led to the city being the home of the nation’s densest population of private and charter schools. While many people are afraid that Betsy DeVos, as the Secretary of Education for the United States, will work to undermine public schools and work to shut them down, she has openly stated that she expects the majority of children to continue to go to public schools.
Betsy DeVos was raised in Holland, Michigan and studied at Calvin College where she received her Bachelor of Arts in Business Economics. She has participated in Michigan politics supporting the conservative party since 1982 and has worked to raise funds for conservative causes over the years, as well. It is her greatest hope that the United States will become a country that supports the rights of parents to choose the school that their children attend regardless of the zip code they live in, and as the new Secretary of Education for the United States, she is well on her way to making her goals a reality.

It may have been just a few weeks since I have been on this campus, but I’m sure these few days are enough for one to realize that the life here is so invigorating that one couldn’t help but get addicted to it. And I realized this when I couldn’t stay away from campus when I went home even for a weekend and longed to come back. The wonderful journey to this heaven on earth began when I filled my SNAP form and ever since there has been no looking back.
Being a Punekar, I never really wanted to leave this amazing city and yet wanted to complete my management studies in one of the finest colleges of India. What other college would come to mind besides SIBM-Pune? Faced with several doubts and questions, there was only one thing certain in my mind while filling the form, if at all I do my MBA, it will be only from SIBM Pune and no other college from Symbiosis International University. And I am certain that I made the right decision. And my firm opinion was justified – such is the reputation of this college in society that one would yearn to be a part of it in any which way. SIBM-Pune is not only one of the premier institutes of India but undoubtedly the best B-school of Pune. So, I filled up the SNAP form with only SIBM Pune as the college I would apply to and submitted it. Hats off to our seniors for doing such a wonderful job by guiding us at every step during the admission procedure and answering even the most trivial of our doubts. After this, began my tryst to SNAP prep. Honing my skills in Quant, Verbal Ability, LR, DI and trying to keep up with all the current affairs and GK made me a more knowledgeable person. It was an amazing and smooth exam taking experience on the D-Day. The test went well and I had a positive feeling that I would be selected for the next round, although there was quite some anxiety in my mind and I eagerly waited for the results. The day the results were announced, my joy knew no bounds as I scored 99.2%ile and was quite certain that I would be called for the GDPI of SIBM Pune. I practiced really well and made myself acquainted with the latest news. I was determined to get into this college. For the GDPI process we were called to the campus and this was the first time when I set foot on this vast, sprawling campus and witnessed its magnificent beauty. The entrance to the college is adorned by a modest and befitting statue of Goddess Saraswati – the epitome of knowledge, which aptly summarizes the rich education system that makes the foundation of this reputed institute. I was impressed by the co-ordination and commitment by our seniors while organizing a smooth GDPI process. It was a moment of privilege for me when the final results were declared and I was invited to be a part of this college in the first list itself.
What does one look for while joining a B-school? Packages, placements, recruiters, faculty, campus? One wouldn’t be exaggerating if they say that SIBM Pune excels in all of these categories. But beyond these materialistic benefits, SIBM Pune believes that the ramifications of a good ethics and value system stretch beyond imagination. And when you have an entire diaspora of such amazing faculty members, alumni and students who insist on a fine education system with a good set of rules and regulations, one’s belief in this notion would certainly be reaffirmed.
This college has already made an indelible mark on my mind. The first few days were like a festival of dance, drama, song and art which brought the entire batch together and bound us in such a way as if we were a part of a close-knit family. The warmest welcome one could ever imagine! All the speeches delivered by the alumni and the senior faculty members during the pre-induction program were thoroughly motivating.
I was lucky to get a chance to anchor and co-ordinate for the alumni interaction meet, where we got to meet notable alumni from every specialization. The guidance offered by a comparatively younger group of alumni added a lot of value to our opinions which I’m sure will help us make an informed decision while choosing our specialization. The HBP modules given to us were so comprehensive that they laid a strong foundation for our management knowledge. And I guess, our batch is lucky since from this year we have been given an option for choosing a major and a minor specialization. I look forward to staying focused on my studies, working hard and performing brilliantly in my academics. I got to make many good friends here, some of which would be friends for life.
Every aspect of this college is vibrant with positive energy. The campus is alive with a lively, jubilant crowd. Many things that I have fallen in love with may seem trivial but definitely these are the points that matter the most. One would experience serene peace and beauty when the drifting clouds touch the hilltops amidst a misty sky. In all these years of my life in Pune, I have never got to see such an amazing view of the city that I got to see from this campus. The weather is so splendid; it makes me feel like i am on a resort. The facilities and amenities that the college offers is state-of-the-art. The mess food is delicious and much better than one would expect from any college in India. Worth mentioning, the rotis here which are cooked hot and fresh To be frank, I don’t remember anyone doing this for me before, besides my mother. I cannot stress enough as to how much I am in love with every tiny aspect of this college, the bus system, the hill base parties, the fountains, the cycles, amphitheatre, swimming pool, badminton and basketball courts.
Having the advantage of staying in Pune itself, I have the option of visiting my home whenever I feel. But the people here are so warm and friendly that I already feel at home on campus. This college accepted me with open arms and is giving me all the love, care and nourishment, which I doubt I would have got in any other college. The university has taken up a new initiative of starting Yoga classes on campus and I sincerely look forward to be a part of it. The college rightly follows its motto वसुधैव कुटुम्बकम and as per my short experience here it has lived up to the true essence of these words. After I am done with my degree, I aspire to emerge not only as a better professional, but also as an evolved human being with a unique set of qualities which define me as true SIBM product. I want to portray my college, SIBM Pune for all that it is worth for and keep up the good name of brand SIBM Pune!
In December of 1965, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. opened his home for the first and only time to television host, Arnold Michaelis, legendary interviewer, who spent four days recording Dr. King and his wife, Coretta, in a uniquely intimate setting, revealing these historic figures’ most private thoughts. This program has never been televised, and had remained unseen in the Michaelis Libary of Living History, University of Georgia Libraries, for over forty years.
Now, George Silano, the veteran director/cameraman, and the only living member of the team, has rediscovered the film. He is available to show and discuss the film from his perspective, at YOUR institution.
An Emmy award nominated cinematographer, George Silano has made many one hour documentaries for television, including the highly regarding, The Soviet Woman, City of Ships, and CBS’ Hunger in America, which changed the way many Americans thought about poverty in their own country.
In addition, he was the director of photography on several feature films including The Last American Hero, starring Jeff Bridges, and was a cameraman on Taps, featuring Tom Cruise, Sean Penn, and George C. Scott. Working with the legendary producer, David Wolper, George filmed biographies of screen icons Bette Davis and Paul Newman.
Silano was active in the turbulent sixties, recording JFK’s inaugural address for national television. George also traveled aboard Air Force One many times, and often dined with LBJ, as he filmed A President’s Country, for the State Department, directed by four-time Academy Award winner Charles Guggenheim, and narrated by Gregory Peck.
Among his most significant assignments was being the only cameraman/director to have been invited into the home of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., where he recorded his most private thoughts and premonitions. Buried in the archives for forty years, Silano has rediscovered this film and has shown it to rave reviews.

As I have already mentioned, the summer visitors have left the Pelion peninsula, sad to go, I would think. The weather was glorious. The refreshing waters of the Pagasitic gulf welcomed the swimmers and divers, and played gently with the littlies who paddled and splashed away happily. All manner of watercraft made its way up and down the gulf, the traffic increasing quite a bit in August when most Europeans take their vacation. Great fun!
There’s an expression in these parts to the effect that the lights go out on the last day of August, and to an extent it’s true. People seal up their summer homes, closing the shutters firmly, tightening everything up against the winter gales that make ancient olive trees vulnerable to their fury, while Poseidon whips the Pagasitic into a frenzy of white water.
No calendar alerts me to the end of the season. The little motorboats being towed up from the resort at Paou to their winter storage tell me that it’s over, that summer is shutting down. Two by two they go, a boatman in front pulling an unmanned boat behind him.
Then he returns, sometimes alone, and sometimes with another boatman, to fetch more. There’s something so final about it. The empty boats, part of a holiday package deal, passed by last week. It’s easy to imagine they were tired, and indeed they are, for they’ve been taking holidaymakers around since early May. They will be cleaned, repaired, painted and freshened up to make memories for vacationers next year.
The people who work so hard in the tourist industry, invariably cheerful through the long, blistering heat of the summer, are making winter preparations also. Some, but not all of them, will be able to take a well-earned rest.
Stoicism in Early Christianity is a collection of thirteen scholarly essays dedicated to exploring the relationship between Greco-Roman philosophy and the development of Christianity in the first and second century. The editors acknowledge in their introduction that the influence of Middle Platonism upon early Greek and Latin church fathers and the interaction between Platonism and Stoicism are important to elucidating early Christian texts; however, the editors assert that the research presented in their collection shows that Stoicism often bears a more significant influence on early Christian writers than Middle Platonism.
Stoicism in Early Christianity is the most recent and complete survey of scholarship on a topic that has been long neglected. The essays are exceptionally rigorous, far-ranging, and represent a high standard of scholarship, making this collection an essential resource for anyone interested in this area of research. For readers with a limited understand of Stoicism, the book provides an excellent introduction to some of the philosophy’s most important concepts. Stoicism in Early Christianity greatly enriches the appreciation of Christianity as part of the cultural fabric of the Greco-Roman world, and it offers a fresh perspective on the relationship between this popular philosophy and Christianity in its earliest years.
The essays contained in this volume are arranged in a roughly chronological order, beginning with contributions on New Testament authors and concluding with examinations of second century Christian texts. The essays are described below in the order in which they appear in the book.
The opening essay by Troels Engberg-Pederson, “Setting the Scene: Stoicism and Platonism in the Transitional Period in Ancient Philosophy,” provides historical and philosophical context for the essays collected in this volume. In the period from about 100 B.C.E. to 200 C.E., the Greco-Roman world experienced a gradual ideological shift from the predominance of Stoicism to the predominance of Platonism. The more fluid negotiation of philosophical ideas typical of this period was a trend that included Jewish and early Christian writers who, like other thinkers, followed the pattern of maintaining allegiance to their founding ideologies while also incorporating alien material.
In “Stoicism as a Key to Pauline Ethics in Romans,” Runar M. Thorsteinsson argues that a basic understanding of Stoic ethics informs Paul’s moral teachings in Romans 12-15, which includes Stoic allusions and analogies that would have been recognizable to his intended readers and important in helping them to understand Paul’s message. Examples from Epictetus, Seneca, and Musonius Rufus (Paul’s Roman contemporaries) are included in Thorsteinsson’s analysis.
Niko Huttunen's “Stoic Law in Paul?” examines how Stoic ideas provide an essential background for Paul’s thinking in 1 Corinthians 7 and Romans 1. . The notion that a person’s social position should be maintained is part of a value system common in Roman Stoicism; in the passage from Corinthians, Paul appears to consider that the same conceptcan be drawn from the Torah, but that relationship remains unclear. Huttunen’s analysis of the passage from Romans shows that Paul’s incorporation of Stoic ideas coexists with Jewish covenantal nomism, and the two approaches should be considered together.
In “Jesus the Teacher and Stoic Ethics in the Gospel of Matthew,” Stanley K. Stowers proposes that the writer of the Gospel of Matthew adapted elements of Stoic thought in creating his portrayal of Jesus as a sage and a teacher of ethics. Stowers limits his discussion to a few of the most distinctive elements of the Matthean Jesus – the idea of a universal ethic based on divine law, the demand for perfection, and the concept of intentionality.
Was the Gospel of John informed in some ways by Stoic thinking? Harold W. Attridge’s “An ‘Emotional’ Jesus and Stoic Tradition” considers the descriptions of the serene and detached Jesus as traits common to the Stoic sage. The Stoics had a highly developed taxonomy of emotions, and those attributed to Jesus and his disciples would have been familiar to readers with a background in Stoicism. While the Fourth Gospel reveals a Stoic influence in the description of emotion, the means of overcoming passions and developing positive emotions is through Christ, and thus the Stoic formulations are made to bear a new meaning.
The emotional Jesus in the later chapters of the Gospel of John, and the possible contrast between these emotions and the Stoic ideal of apathy, is examined by Gitte Buch-Hansen in “The Emotional Jesus: Anti-Stoicism in the Fourth Gospel?” In Origen’s reception of this Gospel, Jesus’ emotional upheavals correspond to the Stoic theory of preemotion as described by Seneca. Lamentations that represented common human interest and a concern with virtue were hallmarks of the philosophy of emotions developed by Philo (who was himself influenced by Stoicism). The same ideas are also found in Paul’s second letter to the Corinthians.
“Stoic Physics, the Universal Conflagration, and the Eschatological Destruction of the ‘Ignorant and Unstable’ in 2 Peter” by J. Albert Harrill provides a fascinating look into the conflagration physics common to many cultures of the ancient Mediterranean world, specifically comparing descriptions of the final judgment in 2 Peter to the survival of sages derived from the Stoic idea of a stable, holistic self. From the Stoic’s perspective, a person’s ethical character and physical state bore a direct correspondence to one another, so that those who live virtuously and have achieved wisdom survive the conflagration; those who, by contrast, have an unstable character do not endure. In 2 Peter, the believers are seekers of true wisdom and survive the end times by proper knowledge, the ignorant and the opponents of Christianity pass away.
While both Christians and adherents of Stoicism accepted slavery and most of their views were commonplace for the time, Christian and Stoic writers called for fair treatment of slaves and believed the condition of slavery was indifferent to the individual’s well-being. John T. Fitzgerald’s “The Stoics and the Early Christians on the Treatment of Slaves” offers a broad survey of the literature on this topic. Corporeal punishment and other forms of abuse inspired by passion or wrong feeling were discouraged by Stoics like Seneca and Lucilius, though more for the sake of the master’s improvement than concern for the slave. Christian writers, on the other hand, tended more often to approach discussions of slavery and right conduct from the perspective of the slave.
The Stoic position on determinism and free choice as expressed by Seneca, and also by second century Christian martyrs, is explored by Nicola Denzey in “Facing the Beast: Justin, Christian Martyrdom, and Freedom of the Will.” The choice of martyrdom as a form of suicide was a display of courage and offered the means to control one’s final encounter with the pain and suffering of life. Going peacefully to meet one’s death was also a display of strength and the ultimate assertion of free will. Martyred Christians were demonstrating these typically Roman and Stoic values in order to subvert the political and moral authority of the state and to gain respectability for the Christian movement, winning many converts among Romans.
“A Stoic Reading of the Gospel of Mary: The Meaning of ‘Matter’ and ‘Nature’ in Gospel of Mary 7.1-8.11” by Esther de Boer discusses Platonic and Gnostic interpretations of the Gospel of Mary in which involvement with and attachment to the material world must be avoided as a source of evil. The author contrasts this with a Stoic interpretation – that the material world was created by the Good, through Nature. If the cosmos is unstable and confused, according to the Gospel of Mary, it is because the world is being influenced by a force acting against Nature. The Savior does not liberate the world by destroying matter, but by restoring Nature to the Good by destroying that which acts against Nature. When compared to other early Christian sources (Philo and Clement of Alexandria) Gospel of Mary more clearly belongs to a context in which Stoic ideas were used to explain evil.
In “Stoic Traditions in the School of Valentinus”, Ismo Dunderberg makes the case for the Valentinian's use of Stoic philosophy by showing how a Stoic reading helps to bring forward certain points with greater clarity than readings from the perspective of other philosophical positions. It is reasonable to assume that Valentinian teachers would have had a philosophical education; it’s also plausible that they would have absorbed Stoic ideas from the popular philosophy of their time. The mythic discourse preferred by the Valentinians remains a problematic area, but it does indicate that the use of Stoicism, along with other sources, was part of a creative palette of innovation, and not a straight-forward adaptation.
In “Critical Reception of the Stoic Theory of Passions in the Apocryphon of John,” Takashi Onuki provides a careful exegesis of two of the four extant copies of Coptic manuscripts of the Apocryphon of John: NHC II, 1 and BG 8502, 2. These versions contain additional material that Onuki calls “the Great Interpolation.” This “Interpolation” involves descriptions of the creation of human beings, part of a greater salvation myth, that reflect Stoic epistemology and character theory. The representation of Stoicism is distorted by the Gnostic viewpoint; the purpose of the “Interpolation” appears to be to demonize Stoic theory, in spite of author’s expressions of a possible affinity for the Stoic ideal of apathy.
“Stoic Ingredients in the Neoplatoinc Being-Life-Mind Triad: An Original Second-Century Gnostic Innovation” by Tuomas Rasimus considers the possible Neoplatonic and Gnostic origins of the being-life-mind triad, later employed by Christians to defend the doctrine of the Trinity. While Plotinus is generally considered the founder of Neoplatonism, it has been argued that his student Porphyry should also be considered a founder of the movement for his improvements to Plotinus’ work; the being-life-mind triad in several variations is the product of Porphyry’s synthesis of Plotinus’ metaphysics with the Middle Platonic Chaldean Oracles. While Rasimus offers an analysis of the Stoic background of Porphyry’s triad, the author points out that Porphyry, who was working in the third century, could not have been the original innovator because the triad, including aspects of the formulation attributed to Porphyry, already existed in Gnostic texts predating his work.

The 30th anniversary of the Tira Hoe Waka taking place this month has been described as a major milestone for Whanganui iwi.
This year's paddle started at Otoko Marae on Friday and is scheduled to stop at more than 12 different marae along the awa, says paddler Jay Rerekura.
“It’s a wānanga that connects us from the mountain to the sea. So at each stop you learn about how the last stop connects to the next,” says Rerekura.
Ash Patea says the anniversary is 'massive' for Whanganui iwi because it’s helped connect people from different parts of the river for generations.
Patea says prior to the beginning of Tira Hoe Waka in 1988, Whanganui River tribes and iwi would only stay in their own areas.
“So, Tira Hoe Waka 30 years ago was actually a movement. It was a sign that our people wanted a different type of unity in particular because of the collective desire of our people to claim our river bank, says Patea.
At least 100 paddlers are involved in this years Tira Hoe Waka journey. Source: Leah Te Whata Facebook
The 30th has attracted the highest number of people ever involved, including at least 100 paddlers and 50 roadies traveling from as far as Australia to take part, says Patea.
This year’s journey also welcomed members of the Kingitanga, including the King Tuheitia’s daughter who celebrated her 21st birthday during the stop at Tawata Marae, says Patea.
Paddlers need to be at least 12 years old to take part. Jay Rerekura, 36, says he first tried out Tira Hoe Waka at the age of 13.
“Like a lot of kids that grew up on the river, once you hit 12 or 13 you were on there. It was just a lot of fun for us.”
He remembers the first time he was on the journey with one of his cousins, who hated using the 'long drop' to go to the toilet.
“The first six or seven days you’re basically out in the elements in the bush and a lot of that has no access by roads so you can’t go anywhere.
“So for six days my cousin didn’t use the long drop. By the last night we were at a place that had a long drop. He had to use it and he got over himself. But some of the stuff can be quite challenging.”
“There’s things you don’t know about yourself until you put yourself in those sorts of situations and, definitely, for a young person you quickly learn your limits. It’s challenging and fulfilling at the same time.”
“As technology has changed, the way that we can travel down the river has changed. There’s probably more resources available to us to be able to do things we couldn’t do back in the day.”
Patea says more funding has gone into the journey this year, covering four new fiberglass waka that were unveiled at Ngāpūwaiwaha Marae on Friday.
Patea says the paddlers will finish their journey on January 17th at Pūtiki marae followed by a celebratory anniversary ball the next day.

Sony Pictures Television has sold the hit comedy series Rules of Engagement to local broadcast stations in the nation's top markets in off-network syndication for Fall 2012. In the top 3 markets, Rules of Engagement has been sold to WPIX-TV New York (Tribune), KCAL9 Los Angeles (CBS) and WCIU-TV Chicago (Weigel). Other leading station groups buying the series include Tribune, CBS, Weigel, Belo and Meredith. As of now, it has been sold so far to 45% of the country.
Rules of Engagement is a comedy about the different phases of male/female relationships, as seen through the eyes of a newly engaged couple, Adam (Oliver Hudson) and Jennifer (Bianca Kajlich), a long-time married pair, Jeff (Patrick Warburton) and Audrey (Megyn Price), and a single guy on the prowl, Russell (David Spade) and his assistant, Timmy (Adhir Kalyan). As they find out, the often confusing stages of a relationship can seem like being on a roller coaster. People can describe the ride to you, but to really know what it's like you have to experience it for yourself.
A consistent utility player in every time slot for CBS during its broadcast network run, Rules of Engagement builds its time period in each of its five seasons. Rules of Engagement is also the #1 CBS network comedy in repeatability, retaining most of its original episode audience. The series heads to its sixth season this fall, but on a new night and time of Saturdays at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT.
Stay tuned for more clearances and a cable deal as well. As of now, Rules hasn't been sold to cable, but if Sony can sell 'Til Death to cable (WGN America), then Rules will be next. Stay with us!

To enlist in the United States armed forces, you must take an entrance examination called the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). The ASVAB test helps the military determine your qualifications for enlistment. The ASVAB first appeared in 1968. By 1976 it was required by all branches of the military. The test was completely redone in 2002.
At this point, it should be clear that an ASVAB practice test is required. The next decision is regarding the people that should be trusted to provide the test. Well, that is undoubtedly the nation's practice tests. They have a team of men and women that thoroughly analyze all areas that are covered on the ASVAB test. In addition to that, those men and women examine previous test questions and implement those so that the user of the tests is provided with the most precise questions. Lastly, one can say based on the unequivocal evidence that individuals that prepare with these ASVAB practice tests excel.

Two of the most destructive moments of state violence in the twentieth century occurred in Europe between 1933 and 1945 and in China between 1959 and 1961 (the Great Leap famine). This is the first book to bring the two histories together in order to examine their differences and to understand if there are any similar processes of transmission at work. The author expertly ties in the Taiwanese civil war between Nationalists and Communists, which included the White Terror from 1947 to 1987, a less well-known but equally revealing part of twentieth-century history. Personal and family stories are told, often in the individual’s own words, and then compared with the public accounts of the same events as found in official histories, commemorations, school textbooks and other forms of public memory. The author presents innovative and constructive criticisms of social memory theories in order to make sense both of what happened and how what happened is transmitted.
News stories provide an essential confirmation of our ideas about who we are, what we have to fear, and what to do about it: a marketplace of ideas, shopped by rational citizen decision makers but also a shared resource for grounding our contested narratives of identity in objective reality. News as a fundamental social process comes into being not when an event takes place or when a report of the event is created but when that report becomes news to someone. As it moves off the page into the community, news discovers - through its interpretations - its reality in the lives of the consumers. This book explores the path of news as it moves through the tangled labyrinth of social identities and asserted interests that lie beyond the page or screen. The language and communication-oriented study of news promises a salient area of investigation, pointing the way to an expansion, if not a redefinition of basic anthropological ideas and practices of ethnography, participant observation, and “the field” in the future of anthropological research.
The Muhammad cartoon crisis of 2005−2006 in Denmark caught the world by surprise as the growing hostilities toward Muslims had not been widely noticed. Through the methodologies of media anthropology, cultural studies, and communication studies, this book brings together more than thirteen years of research on three significant historical media events in order to show the drastic changes and emerging fissures in Danish society and to expose the politicization of Danish news journalism, which has consequences for the political representation and everyday lives of ethnic minorities in Denmark.
As we move deeper into the twenty-first century, power, lethal force, and injustice continue to explode violently into war, and the prospects for lasting peace look even bleaker. The horrors of modern warfare - the death, dehumanization, and destruction of social and material infrastructures - have done little to bring an end to armed conflict.
In this volume, leading chroniclers of war provide thoughtful and powerful essays that reflect on their ethnographic work at the frontlines. The contributors recount not only what they have seen and heard in war zones but also what is being read, studied, analyzed and remembered in such diverse locations as Colombia and Guatemala, Israel and Palestine, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Haiti. In detailed reports from the field, they reflect on the important issue of “accountability” and offer explanations to discern causes, patterns, and practices of war. Through this unique lens, the contributors provide the insight and analysis needed for a deeper understanding of one of the greatest issues of our times.
Bringing together original, contemporary ethnographic research on the Northeast African state of Eritrea, this book shows how biopolitics - the state-led deployment of disciplinary technologies on individuals and population groups - is assuming particular forms in the twenty-first century. Once hailed as the “African country that works,” Eritrea’s apparently successful post-independence development has since lapsed into economic crisis and severe human rights violations. This is due not only to the border war with Ethiopia that began in 1998, but is also the result of discernible tendencies in the “high modernist” style of social mobilization for development first adopted by the Eritrean government during the liberation struggle (1961–1991) and later carried into the post-independence era. The contributions to this volume reveal and interpret the links between development and developmentalist ideologies, intensifying militarism, and the controlling and disciplining of human lives and bodies by state institutions, policies, and discourses. Also assessed are the multiple consequences of these policies for the Eritrean people and the ways in which such policies are resisted or subverted. This insightful, comparative volume places the Eritrean case in a broader global and transnational context.
In the course of hostilities between Greek and Turkish Cypriots between 1963 and 1974, over 2000 persons, both Greek and Turkish Cypriots, went "missing" in Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean with a population distribution of 80% Greeks and 18% Turks. This represents a significant number for a population of only 600,000. Few bodies have been recovered; most will probably not be. All are still mourned by their surviving friends and relatives. The conflict has still not been resolved and the memories are still alive.
Bringing together some of the world’s leading scholars, practitioners, and human rights activists, this groundbreaking volume provides the first systematic analysis of the 2012–2014 Brazilian National Truth Commission. While attentive to the inquiry’s local and national dimensions, it offers an illuminating transnational perspective that considers the Commission’s Latin American regional context and relates it to global efforts for human rights accountability, contributing to a more general and critical reassessment of truth commissions from a variety of viewpoints.
Forms of group identity play a prominent role in everyday lives and politics in northeast Africa. Case studies from Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya illustrate the way that identities are formed and change over time, and how local, national, and international politics are interwoven. Specific attention is paid to the impact of modern weaponry, new technologies, religious conversion, food and land shortages, international borders, civil war, and displacement on group identities. Drawing on the expertise of anthropologists, historians and geographers, these volumes provide a significant account of a society profoundly shaped by identity politics and contribute to a better understanding of the nature of conflict and war, and forms of alliance and peacemaking, thus providing a comprehensive portrait of this troubled region.
Forms of group identity play a prominent role in everyday lives and politics in north-east Africa. These volumes provide an interdisciplinary account of the nature and significance of ethnic, religious, and national identity in north-east Africa. Case studies from Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya illustrate the way that identities are formed and change over time, and how local, national, and international politics are interwoven. Specific attention is paid to the impact of modern weaponry, new technologies, religious conversion, food and land shortages, international borders, civil war, and displacement on group identities. Drawing on the expertise of anthropologists, historians and geographers, these volumes provide a significant account of a society profoundly shaped by identity politics and contribute to a better understanding of the nature of conflict and war, and forms of alliance and peacemaking, thus providing a comprehensive portrait of this troubled region.
War leads not just to widespread death but also to extensive displacement, overwhelming fear, and economic devastation. It weakens social ties, threatens household survival and undermines the family's capacity to care for its most vulnerable members. Every year it kills and maims countless numbers of young people, undermines thousands of others psychologically and deprives many of the economic, educational, health and social opportunities which most of us consider essential for children's effective growth and well being.
Based on detailed ethnographic description and on young people's own accounts, this volume provides insights into children's experiences as both survivors and perpetrators of violence. It focuses on girls who have been exposed to sexual exploitation and abuse, children who head households or are separated from their families, displaced children and young former combatants who are attempting to adjust to their changed circumstances following the cessation of conflict. In this sense, the volume bears witness to the grim effects of warfare and displacement on the young.
Nevertheless, despite the abundant evidence of suffering, it maintains that children are not the passive victims of conflict but engage actively with the conditions of war, an outlook that challenges orthodox research perspectives that rely heavily on medicalized notions of 'victim' and 'trauma.'
Palestinian children and young people living both within and outside of refugee camps in the Middle East are the focus of this book. For more than half a century these children and their caregivers have lived a temporary existence in the dramatic and politically volatile landscape that is the Middle East. These children have been captive to various sorts of stereotyping, both academic and popular. They have been objectified, much as their parents and grandparents, as passive victims without the benefit of international protection. And they have become the beneficiaries of numerous humanitarian aid packages which presume the primacy of the Western model of child development as well as the psycho-social approach to intervention. Giving voice to individual children, in the context of their households and their community, this book aims to move beyond the stereotypes and Western-based models to explore the impact that forced migration and prolonged conflict have had, and continue to have, on the lives of these refugee children.
Chronic violence has characterized Somalia for over two decades, forcing nearly two million people to flee. A significant number have settled in camps in neighboring countries, where children were born and raised. Based on in-depth fieldwork, this book explores the experience of Somalis who grew up in Kakuma refugee camp, in Kenya, and are now young adults. This original study carefully considers how young people perceive their living environment and how growing up in exile structures their view of the past and their country of origin, and the future and its possibilities.
Conflict, domination, violence—in this wide-ranging, briskly narrated volume from acclaimed Mexican historian Carlos Illades, these three phenomena register the pulse of a diverse, but inequitable and discriminatory, social order. Drawing on rich and varied historical sources, Illades guides the reader through seven signal episodes in Mexican social history, from rebellions under Porfirio Díaz’s dictatorship to the cycles of violence that have plagued the country’s deep south to the recent emergence of neo-anarchist movements. Taken together, they comprise a mosaic history of power and resistance, with artisans, rural communities, revolutionaries, students, and ordinary people confronting the forces of domination and transforming Mexican society.
"Only unity saves the Serbs" is the famous call for unity in the Serb nationalist doctrine. But even though this doctrine was ideologically adhered to by most of the Serb leaders in Croatia and Bosnia, disunity characterized Serb politics during the Yugoslav disintegration and war. Nationalism was contested and nationalist claims to homogeneity did not reflect the reality of Serb politics. This book provides a comprehensive analysis of Serb politics and challenges widespread assumptions regarding the Yugoslav conflict and war. It finds that although Slobodan Milosevic played a highly significant role, he was not always able to control the local Serb leaders. Moreover, it adds to the emerging evidence of the lack of importance of popular attitudes; hardline dominance was generally based on the control of economic and coercive resources rather than on elites successfully "playing the ethnic card." It moves beyond an assumption of automatic ethnic outbidding and thus contributes toward a better understanding of intra-ethnic rivalry in other cases such as Israel/Palestine, Northern Ireland, Nagorno-Karabakh and Rwanda.
Crude Domination is an innovative and important book about a critical topic – oil. While there have been numerous works about petroleum from ‘experience-far’ perspectives, there have been relatively few that have turned the ‘experience-near’ ethnographic gaze of anthropology on the topic. Crude Domination does just this among more peoples and more places than any other volume. Its chapters investigate nuances of culture, politics and economics in Africa, Latin America, and Eurasia as they pertain to petroleum. They wrestle with the key questions vexing scholars and practitioners alike: problems of the economic blight of the resource curse, underdevelopment, democracy, violence and war. Additionally they address topics that may initially appear insignificant – such as child witches and lionmen, fighting for oil when there is no oil, reindeer nomadism, community TV – but which turn out on closer scrutiny to be vital for explaining conflict and transformation in petro-states. Based upon these rich, new worlds of information, the text formulates a novel, domination approach to the social analysis of oil.
From its inception, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) provoked controversy. Today it is widely regarded as having contributed to the end of the Cold War. Bringing together new and innovative research on the CSCE, this volume explores questions key to understanding the Cold War: What role did diplomats play in shaping the 1975 Helsinki Final Act? How did that agreement and the CSCE more broadly shape societies in Europe and North America? And how did the CSCE and activists inspired by the Helsinki Final Act influence the end of the Cold War?
Conflicting parties worldwide increasingly use the Internet in a strategic way, and struggles carried out on a local level achieve a new dimension. This new kind of medialization results in a conflict’s expansion into global cyberspace. Based on ethnographic research on the online activities of Christian and Muslim actors in the Moluccan conflict (1999–2003), this study investigates processes of identity construction, community building and evolving conflict dynamics on the Internet. In contributing to conflict and Internet research, this study paves the way for a new cyberanthropology. A newly added epilogue outlines the directions in which the situation in the Moluccas has continued and discusses the advances and developments of theoretical and methodological concerns presented in the 2005 German edition.
The Mediterranean island of Cyprus is the site of enduring political, military, and economic conflict. This interdisciplinary collection takes Cyprus as a geographical, cultural and political point of reference for understanding how conflict is mediated, represented, reconstructed, experienced, and transformed. Through methodologically diverse case studies of a wide range of topics—including public art, urban spaces, and print, broadcast and digital media—it assembles an impressively multifaceted perspective, one that provides broad insights into the complex interplay of culture, conflict, and identity.
Many anthropological accounts of warfare in indigenous societies have described the taking of heads or other body parts as trophies. But almost nothing is known of the prevalence of trophy-taking of this sort in the armed forces of contemporary nation-states. This book is a history of this type of misconduct among military personnel over the past two centuries, exploring its close connections with colonialism, scientific collecting and concepts of race, and how it is a model for violent power relationships between groups.
As US imperialism continues to dictate foreign policy, Deadly Contradictions is a compelling account of the American empire. Stephen P. Reyna argues that contemporary forms of violence exercised by American elites in the colonies, client state, and regions of interest have deferred imperial problems, but not without raising their own set of deadly contradictions. This book can be read many ways: as a polemic against geopolitics, as a classic social anthropological text, or as a seminal analysis of twenty-four US global wars during the Cold War and post-Cold War eras.
Political scientists, demographers, legal scholars, and historians have come together in this volume, under the direction of the late Myron Weiner, one of the leading scholars in this field, to address three of the major sets of questions in the field of political demography: How changes in demographic variables - population size, growth, distribution, and composition - influence threats (real or perceived) to a country's political stability and security; how governments respond to demographic trends; and how governments attempt to change demographic variables in order to enhance national security.
The Sahrawi and Afghan refugee youth in the Middle East have been stereotyped regionally and internationally: some have been objectified as passive victims; others have become the beneficiaries of numerous humanitarian aid packages which presume the primacy of the Western model of child development. This book compares and contrasts both the stereotypes and Western-based models of humanitarian assistance among Sahrawi youth with the lack of programming and near total self-sufficiency of Afghan refugee youth in Iran. Both extremes offer an important opportunity to further explore the impact which forced migration and prolonged conflict have had, and continue to have, on the lives of these refugee youth and their families. This study examines refugee communities closely linked with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and a host of other UN agencies in the case of the Sahrawi and near total lack of humanitarian aid in the case of Afghan refugees in Iran.
At a time when the international community is again threatening some countries with sanctions, this book comes as a warning. It should be mandatory reading for all those politicians and their foreign-policy advisors who continue to consider sanctions an effective form of policy. The author not only offers us a critical, lucid, and well-informed survey of political developments in Iraq, but also a heart-rending account of the suffering of the Iraqi people. It was they who bore the brunt of the 13-year's sanctions, while the members of Saddam's regime continued to live in luxury and accumulate huge fortunes.
H.-C. von Sponeck, the former “UN Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq,” explores the UN's sanction policies against Iraq, their consequences, and the domestic conditions during this period. His extensive research is based on previously unpublished internal UN documents and discussions with UN decision makers (such as General Secretary Kofi Annan), Iraqi officials and politicians (including Saddam Hussein), and ordinary Iraqis. The author’s findings question who really benefited from the program, what role the UN Security Council and its various member states played, and whether there were then and are today alternatives to the UN's Iraq policies.
What does it mean to “fit in?” In this volume of essays, editors Günther Schlee and Alexander Horstmann demystify the discourse on identity, challenging common assumptions about the role of sameness and difference as the basis for inclusion and exclusion. Armed with intimate knowledge of local systems, social relationships, and the negotiation of people’s positions in the everyday politics, these essays tease out the ways in which ethnicity, religion and nationalism are used for social integration.
There is growing political concern about the increasing numbers of people displaced both within the borders of their countries and internationally. This volume explores the interrelated drivers of contemporary global displacement with a particular focus on low-level conflict, climatic and environmental change and infrastructure development. The authors examine the governance of global displacement assessing the protection needs and responses of national governments and the international community. It further considers options for improving the humanitarian and political management of this growing problem.
Ethnic conflicts have shaped the 20th century in significant ways. While the legacy of the last century is primarily one of many unresolved conflicts, the author contends that Western Europe has a track record in containing and settling ethnic conflicts which provides valuable lessons for conflict management elsewhere. Focusing on ethno-territorial crossborder conflicts in Alsace, the Saarland, South Tyrol, and Northern Ireland, Andorra and the New Hebrides, the author develops a four-dimensional analytical framework that synthesizes the distinct factors that influence the complex relationship between host-state, kin-state, actors in the disputed territory, and in the international context.
As migration from poverty-stricken and conflict-affected countries continues to hit the headlines, this book focuses on an important counter-flow: the money that people send home. Despite considerable research on the impact of migration and remittances in countries of origin - increasingly viewed as a source of development capital - still little is known about refugees’ remittances to conflict-affected countries because such funds are most often seen as a source of conflict finance. This book explores the dynamics, infrastructure, and far-reaching effects of remittances from the perspectives of people in the Somali regions and the diaspora. With conflict driving mass displacement, Somali society has become progressively transnational, its vigorous remittance economy reaching from the heart of the global North into wrecked cities, refugee camps, and remote rural areas. By ‘following the money’ the author opens a window on the everyday lives of people caught up in processes of conflict, migration, and development. The book demonstrates how, in the interstices of state disruption and globalisation, and in the shadow of violence and political uncertainty, life in the Somali regions goes on, subject to complex transnational forms of social, economic, and political innovation and change.
On the surface, historical scholarship might seem thoroughly incompatible with political engagement: the ideal historian, many imagine, is a disinterested observer focused exclusively on the past. In truth, however, political action and historical research have been deeply intertwined for as long as the historical profession has existed. In this insightful collection, practicing historians analyze, reflect on, and share their experiences of this complex relationship. From the influence of historical scholarship on world political leaders to the present-day participation of researchers in post-conflict societies and the Occupy movement, these studies afford distinctive, humane, and stimulating views on historical practice and practitioners
The civil conflict in Solomon Islands (1998-2003) is often blamed on the failure of the nation-state to encompass culturally diverse and politically fragmented communities. Writing of Ranongga Island, the author tracks engagements with strangers across many realms of life—pre-colonial warfare, Christian conversion, logging and conservation, even post-conflict state building. She describes startling reversals in which strangers become attached to local places, even as kinspeople are estranged from one another and from their homes. Against stereotypes of rural insularity, she argues that a distinctive cosmopolitan openness to others is evident in the rural Solomons in times of war and peace.
Europe has seen a tremendous rise in popularity of new rightist political parties in the last two decades or so, claiming cultural supremacy of the so-called native Europeans over foreign immigrants. In this volume, European scholars from Russian to Britain have come together to examine the media and social and legal policies in an effort to determine the causes of this resurgence of rightist and anti-democratic ideologies. They furthermore suggest actions that might help combat racism more effectively.
Spurred by wars and a drive to urbanize, Africans are crossing borders and overwhelming cities in unprecedented numbers. At the center of this development are young refugee men who migrate to urban areas.
This volume, the first full-length study of urban refugees in hiding, tells the story of Burundi refugee youth who escaped from remote camps in central Tanzania to work in one of Africa's fastest-growing cities, Dar es Salaam. This steamy, rundown capital would seem uninviting to many, particularly for second generation survivors of genocide whose lives are ridden with fear. But these young men nonetheless join migrants in "Bongoland" (meaning "Brainland") where, as the nickname suggests, only the shrewdest and most cunning can survive.
Mixing lyrics from church hymns and street vernacular, descriptions of city living in cartoons and popular novels and original photographs, this book creates an ethnographic portrait of urban refugee life, where survival strategies spring from street smarts and pastors' warnings of urban sin, and mastery of popular youth culture is highly valued. Pentecostalism and a secret rift within the seemingly impenetrable Hutu ethnic group are part of the rich texture of this contemporary African story. Written in accessible prose, this book offers an intimate picture of how Africa is changing and how refugee youth are helping to drive that change.
The availability of food is an especially significant issue in zones of conflict because conflict nearly always impinges on the production and the distribution of food, and causes increased competition for food, land and resources Controlling the production of and access to food can also be used as a weapon by protagonists in conflict. The logistics of supply of food to military personnel operating in conflict zones is another important issue. These themes unite this collection, the chapters of which span different geographic areas. This volume will appeal to scholars in a number of different disciplines, including anthropology, nutrition, political science, development studies and international relations, as well as practitioners working in the private and public sectors, who are currently concerned with food-related issues in the field.
During the last 15-20 years a new party family of radical right-wing populism (RRP) has emerged in Western Europe, consisting of parties such as the French Front National and the Austrian Freedom's Party, among many others. Contrary to the situation in the other Scandinavian countries, such parties have been largely unsuccessful in Sweden. Although Sweden saw the emergence of the populist party New Democracy - which partly can be classified as a RRP party - in the early 1990s, it collapsed in 1994, and no party has so far been successful enough to take its place. Most of the literature on populism and right-wing extremism deals with successful cases; this book takes the opposite direction and asks how one can explain the failure of Swedish radical right-wing populism.
Providing nuanced accounts of how the social identities of men and women, the context of displacement and the experience or manifestation of violence interact, this collection offers conceptual analyses and in-depth case studies to illustrate how gender relations are affected by displacement, encampment and return. The essays show how these factors lead to various forms of direct, indirect and structural violence. This ranges from discussions of norms reflected in policy documents and practise, the relationship between relief structures and living conditions in camps, to forced military recruitment and forced return, and covers countries in Africa, Asia and Europe.
"Berlin, 12 January 2030 – The crisis worsens. The Chancellor reaches for the telephone. He instructs his anteroom to put through a call to Germany's most important ally in order to discuss the situation and determine a further course of action." With whom would the chancellor speak? With the American, the French, or maybe even the Russian president? Or will the Chancellor only exercise representative functions while the real responsibility and decision-making authority lies with the President of the United Regions of Europe? This volume invites policy makers and politicians to use their imagination, to look beyond current events and take a long-term view on possible developments. Such projections, the author argues, lead to interesting conclusions for strategic planning.
Grassroots memorials have become major areas of focus during times of trauma, danger, and social unrest. These improvised memorial assemblages continue to display new and more dynamic ways of representing collective and individual identities and in doing so reveal the steps that shape the national memories of those who struggle to come to terms with traumatic loss. This volume focuses on the hybrid quality of these temporary memorials as both monuments of mourning and as focal points for protest and expression of discontent. The broad range of case studies in this volume include anti-mafia shrines, Theo van Gogh’s memorial, September 11th memorials, March 11th shrines in Madrid, and Carlo Giuliani memorials in Genoa.
Since 1989 neo-nationalism has grown as a volatile political force in almost all European societies in tandem with the formation of a neoliberal European Union and wider capitalist globalizations. Focusing on working classes situated in long-run localized processes of social change, including processes of dispossession and disenfranchisement, this volume investigates how the experiences, histories, and relationships of social class are a necessary ingredient for explaining the re-emergence and dynamics of populist nationalism in both Eastern and Western Europe. Featuring in-depth urban and regional case studies from Romania, Hungary, Serbia, Italy and Scotland this volume reclaims class for anthropological research and lays out a new interdisciplinary agenda for studying identity politics in the intensifying neoliberal conjuncture.
In popular perception cultural differences or ethnic affiliation are factors that cause conflict or political fragmentation although this is not borne out by historical evidence. This book puts forward an alternative conflict theory. The author develops a decision theory which explains the conditions under which differing types of identification are preferred. Group identification is linked to competition for resources like water, territory, oil, political charges, or other advantages. Rivalry for resources can cause conflicts but it does not explain who takes whose side in a conflict situation. This book explores possibilities of reducing violent conflicts and ends with a case study, based on personal experience of the author, of conflict resolution.
In an age of heightened awareness of the threat that western industrialized societies pose to the environment, hunters and gatherers attract particularly strong interest because they occupy the ecological niches that are constantly eroded. Despite the denial of sovereignty, the world's more than 350 million indigenous peoples continue to assert aboriginal title to significant portions of the world's remaining bio-diversity. As a result, conflicts between tribal peoples and nation states are on the increase. Today, many of the societies that gave the field of anthropology its empirical foundations and unique global vision of a diverse and evolving humanity are being destroyed as a result of national economic, political, and military policies.
Although quite a sizable body of literature exists on the living conditions of the hunters and gatherers, this volume is unique in that it represents the first extensive east-west scholarly exchange in anthropology since the demise of the USSR. Moreover, it also offers new perspectives from indigenous communities and scholars in an exchange that be termed "south-north" as opposed to " north-north," denoting the predominance of northern Europe and North America in scholarly debate.
The main focus of this volume is on the internal dynamics and political strategies of hunting and gathering societies in areas of self-determination and self-representation. More specifically, it examines areas such as warfare and conflict resolution, resistance, identity and the state, demography and ecology, gender and representation, and world view and religion. It raises a large number of major issues of common concerns and therefore makes important reading for all those interested in human rights issues, ethnic conflict, grassroots development and community organization, and environmental topics.
In response to the attacks of September 11, 2001 and war in Afghanistan, the Fulbright New Century Scholars program brought together social scientists from around the world to study sectarian, ethnic, and cultural conflict within and across national borders. As one result of their year of intense discussion, this book examines the roots of collective violence — and the measures taken to avoid it — in Burma (Myanmar), China, Germany, Pakistan, Senegal, Singapore, Thailand, Tibet, Ukraine, Southeast Asia, and Western Europe.
Case studies and theoretical essays introduce the basic principles necessary to identify and explain the symbols and practices each unique human group holds sacred or inalienable. The authors apply the methods of political science, social psychology, anthropology, journalism, and educational research. They build on the insights of Gordon Allport, Charles Taylor, and Max Weber to describe and analyze the patterns of behavior that social groups worldwide use to maintain their identities.
Written to inform the general reader and communicate across disciplinary boundaries, this important and timely volume demonstrates ways of understanding, predicting and coping with ethnic and sectarian violence.
From September 1990 to June 1991, the UK deployed 53,462 military personnel in the Gulf War. After the end of the conflict anecdotal reports of various disorders affecting troops who fought in the Gulf began to surface. This mysterious illness was given the name “Gulf War Syndrome” (GWS). This book is an investigation into this recently emergent illness, particularly relevant given ongoing UK deployments to Iraq, describing how the illness became a potent symbol for a plethora of issues, anxieties, and concerns. At present, the debate about GWS is polarized along two lines: there are those who think it is a unique, organic condition caused by Gulf War toxins and those who argue that it is probably a psychological condition that can be seen as part of a larger group of illnesses. Using the methods and perspective of anthropology, with its focus on nuances and subtleties, the author provides a new approach to understanding GWS, one that makes sense of the cultural circumstances, specific and general, which gave rise to the illness.
Focusing on Irish speakers in Catholic West Belfast, this ethnography on Irish language and identity explores the complexities of changing, and contradictory, senses of Irishness and shifting practices of 'Irish culture' in the domains of language, music, dance and sports. The author’s theoretical approach to ethnicity and ethnic revivals presents an expanded explanatory framework for the social (re)production of ethnicity, theorizing the mutual interrelations between representations and cultural practices regarding their combined capacity to engender ethnic revivals. Relevant not only to readers with an interest in the intricacies of the Northern Irish situation, this book also appeals to a broader readership in anthropology, sociology, cultural studies, history and political science concerned with the mechanisms behind ethnonational conflict and the politics of culture and identity in general.
Since the nineteenth century, the development of international humanitarian law has been marked by complex entanglements of legal theory, historical trauma, criminal prosecution, historiography, and politics. All of these factors have played a role in changing views on the applicability of international law and human rights ideas to state-organized violence, which in turn have been largely driven by transnational responses to German state crimes. Here, Annette Weinke gives a groundbreaking long-term history of the political, legal and academic debates concerning German state and mass violence in the First World War, during the National Socialist era and the Holocaust, and under the GDR.
The civil war in Sri Lanka and the part that nationalism seemed to play in it inspired the writing of this book some twenty-three years ago. The argument was developed through a comparative analysis of nationalism in Sri Lanka with the author’s native Australia. At the time this constituted an innovative approach to comparison in anthropology, as well as to nationalism and its possibilities. It was not based on differences but on the way in which perspectives from within the two nationalisms, when seen side-by-side, could present an understanding of their implication in producing the violence of war, racism, and social exclusion. The book has lost none of its importance and urgency as proven by the chapters in the Appendix, written by top scholars working in Sri Lanka and in Australia. These contributions bring together new material and critically explore the book’s themes and their continued relevance to the various trajectories in nationalist processes since the first publication of the book.
Why do people turn to personal connections to get things done? Exploring the role of favors in social welfare systems in postwar, postsocialist Bosnia and Herzegovina, this volume provides a new theoretical angle on links between ambiguity and power. It demonstrates that favors were not an instrumental tactic of survival, nor a way to reproduce oneself as a moral person. Instead, favors enabled the insertion of personal compassion into the heart of the organization of welfare.
Managing Ambiguity follows how neoliberal insistence on local community, flexibility, and self-responsibility was translated into clientelist modes of relating and back, and how this fostered a specific mode of power.
Studies of the military that deal with the actual experience of troops in the field are still rare in the social sciences. In fact, this ethnographic study of an elite unit in the Israeli Defense Force is the only one of its kind. As an officer of this unit and a professional anthropologist, the author was ideally positioned for his role as participant observer. During the eight years he spent with his unit he focused primarily on such notions as "conflict", "the enemy", and "soldiering" because they are, he argues, the key points of reference for "what we are" and "what we are trying to do" and form the basis for interpreting the environment within which armies operate. Relying on the latest anthropological approaches to cognitive models and the social constructions of emotion and masculinity, the author offers an in-depth analysis of the dynamics that drive the men's attitudes and behavior, and a rare and fascinating insight into the reality of military life.
Some semi-public, exclusive male settings, most noticeably in the military, encourage the production of intimacy and desire. Yet whereas in most instances this desire is displaced through humor and aggressive gestures, it becomes acknowledged and outright declared once associated with sites of heroic death. In his provocative study of interrelations between friendship in everyday life and national sentiments in Israel, the author follows selected stories of friendship ranging over early childhood, school, the workplace, and some unique war experiences. He explores the symbolism of friendship in rituals for the fallen soldiers, the commemoration of Prime Minister Yzhak Rabin, and the national infatuation with recovering bodies of missing soldiers. He concludes that the Israeli case offers an extreme instance of a much broader cultural phenomenon: declaring the friendship for the dead epitomizes the political “blood pact” between men, taking precedence over the traditional blood ties of kinship and heterosexual unions. The book underscores nationalism as a homosocial-based emotion of commemorative desire.
The northern Italian, ‘Padanian’ identity, fostered by the Lega Nord, is rooted in the long-standing tradition, in political and scholarly discourse, of casting regional differences within Italy in terms of a North-South geographic divide. Trying to come to terms, in the late 1980s and 1990s, with Italy’s (real or presumed) inadequacies – such as inefficient government, corruption, and organized crime – this imagined geography acquired political centrality in that the North became associated with the virtues of modernity and the South with the vices of un-modernity. It was not only politicians but also social scientists, who fostered and perpetuated this conceptualization of the North-South divide, thus imposing a normative hierarchy between the two parts of the country.
In response to this discourse many scholars, both in Italy and abroad, have started to question this perception of the South as a “backward” and implicitly inferior society. Starting from this critical tradition, Michel Huysseune provides a new, systematic, and interdisciplinary approach that re-interprets the premises behind Italy’s imagined geography of modernity. He moves beyond an understanding of the South as a “backward” and implicitly inferior society and problematizes normative notions of modernity, thus offering a new perspective on the North-South divide, which has a significance well beyond the case of Italy.
As many scholars have argued, racism and its passions are created by and subordinated to the nation. This volume places the practices of racism at the center of analysis of so-called post-racist or multi cultural nation-states. This way, each contributor analytically treats racism and its related concepts of race, identity, culture, and naturalizing symbols of blood to highlight the manner in which governing institutions use nationalist precepts to create "races". In the end, it is racism - the actual political practices of domination - that makes "race" salient, especially in its multi-cultural and liberal-democratic form.
By the early twenty-first century neo-nationalist forces have established themselves in a number of the world’s large regions and subcontinents. From Australia to South Asia, in Eastern and Western Europe, comparable parties and movements have positioned themselves in national parliaments and governments, with some considerable impact on state power. In contrast to right-wing extremist parties in the past, these recent movements mostly operate within legal parliamentary channels, using essentialized notions of local culture to mobilize against real and alleged threats to local identities of status, gender, religion, nationhood and ethnicity.
Prompted by this near-simultaneous rise to political influence of more than a dozen apparently similar parties across Western Europe, this collection offers a range of European case studies with selected global examples, such as the Front National, the late Pim Fortuyn, India and the BJP, and Pauline Hanson and her One Nation Party in Australia. It takes up the theoretical and methodological challenges posed by this phenomenon and asks what distinctive contributions anthropology might make to its study.
Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan: Taken together, these conflicts are the key to understanding more than a half century of American military history. In addition, they have shaped, in profound ways, the culture and politics of the United States—as well as the nations in which they have been fought. This volume brings together international experts on American history and foreign affairs to assess the cumulative impact of the United States’ often halting and conflicted attempts to end wars. It offers essential perspectives on the Cold War and post-9/11 eras and explores the troubling implications of the American tendency to fight wars without end.
Dieter Senghaas today is the world's leading figure in the field of conflict research, conflict management research, and the study of the prerequisites of lasting peace. The fact that virulent conflict within what Senghaas calls the OECD world, essentially the European Union, has become unthinkable over the past half-century encourages him in the face of violent conflict in many parts of the world to be reasonably optimistic about the prospect for our planet as a whole.
Retaliation is associated with all forms of social and political organization, and retaliatory logics inform many different conflict resolution procedures from consensual settlement to compensation to violent escalations. This book derives a concept of retaliation from the overall notion of reciprocity, defining retaliation as the human disposition to strive for a reactive balancing of conflicts and injustices. On Retaliation presents a synthesized approach to both the violence-generating and violence-avoiding potentials of retaliation. Contributors to this volume touch upon the interaction between retaliation and violence, the state’s monopoly on legitimate punishment and the factors of socio-political frameworks, religious interpretations and economic processes.
Located in the far-western Tarai region of Nepal, Kailali has been the site of dynamic social and political change in recent history. The Partial Revolution examines Kailali in the aftermath of Nepal’s Maoist insurgency, critically examining the ways in which revolutionary political mobilization changes social relations—often unexpectedly clashing with the movement’s ideological goals. Focusing primarily on the end of Kailali’s feudal system of bonded labor, Hoffmann explores the connection between politics, labor, and Mao’s legacy, documenting the impact of changing political contexts on labor relations among former debt-bonded laborers.
Across the West, the explosion of social movement activity since the late 1960s has constituted a “participatory revolution” that has posed profound challenges for formal political parties. Through an analysis of new interviews, institutional documents, and a host of other largely unexploited sources, Daniela R. Piccio provides a rich and empirically grounded exploration of the wide-ranging responses to these movements. Focusing on Italy and the Netherlands since the 1970s, Party Responses to Social Movements demonstrates how political parties have incorporated the demands of movements to a surprising extent, even as both have grappled with fundamental and inevitable tensions between their respective roles and aims.
This ethnography of personhood in post-genocide Rwanda investigates how residents of a small town grapple with what kinds of persons they ought to become in the wake of violence. Based on fieldwork carried out over the course of a decade, it uncovers how conflicting moral demands emerge from the 1994 genocide, from cultural contradictions around “good” personhood, and from both state and popular visions for the future. What emerges is a profound dissonance in town residents’ selfhood. While they strive to be agents of change who can catalyze a new era of modern Rwandan nationhood, they are also devastated by the genocide and struggle to recover a sense of selfhood and belonging in the absence of kin, friends, and neighbors. In drawing out the contradictions at the heart of self-making and social life in contemporary Rwanda, this book asserts a novel argument about the ordinary lives caught in global post-conflict imperatives to remember and to forget, to mourn and to prosper.
For displaced persons, memory and identity is performed, (re)constructed and (re)negotiated daily. Forced displacement radically reshapes identity, with results ranging from successful hybridization to feelings of permanent misplacement. This compelling and intimate description of places of pain and (be)longing that were lost during the 1992–95 war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as of survivors’ places of resettlement in Australia, Europe and North America, serves as a powerful illustration of the complex interplay between place, memory and identity. It is even more the case when those places have been vandalized, divided up, brutalized and scarred. However, as the author shows, these places of humiliation and suffering are also places of desire, with displaced survivors emulating their former homes in the far corners of the globe where they have resettled.
Focusing on ethnicity and its relation to conflict, this book goes beyond sterile debates about whether ethnic identities are ‘natural’ or ‘socially constructed’. Rather, ethnic identity takes different forms. Some ethnic boundaries are perceived by the actors themselves as natural, while others are perceived to be permeable. The argument is substantiated through a comparative analysis of ethnic identity formation and ethnic conflict among the Anywaa and the Nuer in the Gambella region of western Ethiopia. The Anywaa and the Nuer are not just two ethnic groups but two kinds of ethnic groups. Conflicts between the Anywaa and Nuer are explained with reference to three variables: varying modes of identity formation, competition over resources and differential incorporation into the state system.
Based on thorough ethnographic fieldwork in a refugee camp in Tanzania this book provides a rich account of the benevolent “disciplining mechanisms” of humanitarian agencies, led by the UNHCR, and of the situated, dynamic, indeterminate, and fluid nature of identity (re)construction in the camp. While the refugees are expected to behave as innocent, helpless victims, the question of victimhood among Burundian Hutu is increasingly challenged, following the 1993 massacres in Burundi and the Rwandan genocide. The book explores how different groups within the camp apply different strategies to cope with these issues and how the question of innocence and victimhood is itself imbued with ambiguity, as young men struggle to recuperate their masculinity and their political subjectivity.
During the last decade and a half a new political party family, the extreme Right-wing populist (ERP) parties, has established itself in a variety of West European democracies. These parties represent a monist politics based on ethnic nationalism and xenophobia as well as an opposition against the 'political establishment'. Being the prototypic ERP party, the French Front National (FN) has been a model for ERP parties emerging elsewhere in Western Europe.
This study presents a theoretically based explanation that combines the macro and the micro-level, as well as the political supply and the demand-side. More specifically, this study shows that it is necessary to consider both opportunity structures, created by demand and supply-side factors, as well as the ability of the FN to take advantage of the available opportunities. Of particular interest is the author's analysis of the sociology and attitudes of the FN-voters.
In Southeast Europe, the Balkans, and Middle East, scholars often refer to the “peaceful coexistence” of various religious and ethnic groups under the Ottoman Empire before ethnonationalist conflicts dissolved that shared space and created legacies of division. Post-Ottoman Coexistence interrogates ways of living together and asks what practices enabled centuries of cooperation and sharing, as well as how and when such sharing was disrupted. Contributors discuss both historical and contemporary practices of coexistence within the context of ethno-national conflict and its aftermath.
The fact is that war comes in many guises and its effects continue to be felt long after peace is proclaimed. This challenges the anthropologists who write of war as participant observers. Participant observation inevitably deals with the here and now, with the highly specific. It is only over the long view that one can begin to see the commonalities that emerge from the different forms of conflict and can begin to generalize. [From the Introduction]
More needs to be understood about the ways of war and its effects. What implications does war have for people, their lived-in communities and larger political systems; how do they cope and adjust in war situations and how do they deal with the changed world that they inhabit once peace is declared? Through a series of essays that move from looking at the nature of violence to the peace processes that follow it, this important book provides some answers to these questions. It also analyzes those new dimensions of social interaction, such as the internet, which now provide a bridge between local concerns and global networks and are fundamentally altering the practices of war.
In recent years, scholars in the fields of refugee studies and forced migration have extended their areas of interest and research into the phenomenon of displacement, human response to it, and ways to intervene to assist those affected, increasingly focusing on the emotional and social impact of displacement on refugees and their adjustment to the traumatic experiences. In the process, the positive concept of "psychosocial wellness" was developed as discussed in this volume. In it noted scholars address the strengths and limitations of their investigations, citing examples from their work with refugees from Afghanistan, Cambodia, Vietnam, Palestine, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Eastern Europe, Bosnia, and Chile. The authors discuss how they define "psychosocial wellness," as well as the issues of sample selection, measurement, reliability and validity, refugee narratives and "voices," and the ability to generalize findings and apply these to other populations. The key question that has guided many of these investigations and underlies the premise of this book is "what happens to an ordinary person who has experienced an extraordinary event?" This volume also highlights the fact that those involved in such research must also deal with their own emotional responses as they hear victims tell of killing, torture, humiliation, and dispossesion. The volume will therefore appeal to practitioners of psychology, psychiatry, social work, nursing, and anthropology. However, its breadth and the evaluation of the strengths and disadvantages of both qualitative and quantitative methods also make it an excellent text for students.
Nation states and minorities resort more and more to violence when safeguarding their political interests. Although the violence in the Middle East has been dominating world politics for some time now, European governments have had their share of ethnic violence to contend with as this volume demonstrates. And as the case studies show, ranging as they do from the Basque Country to Chechnya, from Northern Ireland to Bosnia-Herzegovina, this applies to western Europe as much as to eastern Europe. However, in contrast to other parts of the world, instances where political struggles for power and social inclusion between minorities and majorities lead to full-fledged inter-ethnic warfare are still the exception; in the majority of cases conflicts are successfully de-escalated and even resolved. In a comprehensive conclusion, the volume offers a theoretical framework for the development of strategies to deal with violent ethnic conflict.
