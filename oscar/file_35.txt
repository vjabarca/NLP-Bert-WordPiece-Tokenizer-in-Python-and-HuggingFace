While bollywood fashion can sometimes be a hit or miss, i find that the sunglasses worn by the heros/heroines are always trendy and can even be worn in these modern times, i would no doubt wear anyone of them should i come acrooss them. Below are some lovely bollywood stars and their sunglasses from different movies, Enjoy
Which of the above sunglasses are your favourites? I will definitely be doing more sometime in the future as i'm constantly on the watch and looks like i've caught the bollywood style sunglasses bug as well ;0)
Aviators are totally back in style, as are the oversized 70's look I think. It is so true what they say: Everything old is new again!
My faves (though there's no way I could pull them off) are Zeenat Aman's hippy collection (so cool!). The ones I would categorize in the "What were they thinking?!!!" category are Rekha's wacky ones from Khoon Bhari Maang, especially the second ones! Who would EVER wear those! lol!!!
Ah, good post! :-) Even if Bollywood did some really whacky interiors and some weird clothes, at least they managed to get the sun glasses right, most of the time.
@ Shell Thanks so much, indeed i knew Rekha's ones from Khoon Bhari Maang are sure to raise some eyebrows but i'll forgive her as most of her fashion in that movie were edgy
@ Dusted off Thanks a lot, Kabir does indeed look fantastic in the aviators if i could have any apart from Rishi's it would be his, Vinod looks great as well, he's a far cry from his handsome self in his younger days but he still looks good
They are aren't they Nicki, i'd gladly wear lots of them and the funny thing is that similar styles to this especially the ones made by the top design houses costs quite a lot, Old is always gold (well in some cases anyway)
YAAAY i love this post, I watched Hare Rama Hare Krishna and i searched all of Vancouver to find all the sunglasses zeenat wore too. My favorite glasses were the crazy ones i bought which were almost the same as the ones Ajit wore in Yaadon Ki Baraat!
Nice! Great photos... my faves are Shammi, Rajesh and Sanjeev. Looking forward to more. I love sunglasses and the way they seem to give you instant attitude and sometimes even a faint air of mystery.
Thanks Daddy's girl I agree with you i feel ths same way in them, they give you an attitude and indeeda faint air of mystery perfect also for when you don't want to make eye contact with anyone
@ Amodini Thanks, i always keep my eyes out when watching movies for sunglasses and while watching Choti Bahen when i saw Shobha Khote wearing one i knew i had to have her screencap
Thanks Rum i saw Yaadon Ki Barat long ago before i started blogging otherwise, i would have had Ajit in his fly shades amongst these lot
Vintage sunglasses and that too pink ones of Rekha, please I think very few girls would like a pink china sunglasses. I think a brown shade is always acceptable and some other shades are cool. You want to wear cool shades not these ones.
@ Alex it tottally depends on personal tastes, i myself like a bit of colour every now and then, Thanks for stopping by
@ buy viagra thanks Babita's shades are indeed bang on trend, keep checking back, as i'll be adding more images to this post
Wonderful article,thanks for putting this together! "This is obviously one great post. Thanks for the valuable information and insights you have so provided here. Keep it up!"
Hee! If I had to choose just one, I'd go for Babita's :) I need to rummage through my images to find some of Shashi in shades...none come to mind, but surely that can't be right!
I know right Beth it difficult having to choose just one, Babita's is lovely fo sure, i'll be updating this post regularly from now on as i spot so many fab ones in lots of movies
Fashion and Style matters great importance for every modern people. Wearing Sunglasses have become now a fashion trend. Nice to see popular celebrities in sunglasses.
Amitabh in Silsila gets my vote! Now, Abhay Deol in Dev.D had great ones. Cool post here, I'll include in my shared items for sure.
@ The bollywood fan Thanks yaar, Amitabh's one in silsila is amongst my favourites too, funny enough i sawa picture of Will.I.Am from the black eyed opeas wearing something very similar recently
u missed BigB's yellow aviators from Don....and then there's Agneepath....few actors looked so much graceful as Bacchan saab with glasses on

I love female noses very much and got to see some sexy noses sporting sunglasses. I was particularly turned on looking at Saroja Devi's pic. I realize that I was not even born during that time (when Sasural was released) but couldn't help but admire the sexy-nosed Saroja Devi. Love her ! :)

Bollywood is like a hobby for me, i love reading about it, watching, researching etc. I started this blog out of inspiration by other bollywood blogs i read, plus i watch a good deal of movies, at least 2-3 in a week, hence i thought why not give my reviews and share my love of Indian Cinema. Thanks for stopping by
Say what you will about her acting, however, there's no denying that when it comes to Style in Bollywood, Sonam Kapoor is head and shoulders above the rest (yet again)

Over the past 50 years, the fight between the Ford Mustang and Chevy Camaro has been the automotive equivalent of the Civil War. Allegiances for either camp can result in fathers fighting sons, brothers battling brothers, mothers fighting daughters, and can turn any normal Thanksgiving dinner into something resembling the Hatfields sitting down with the McCoys. Decade after decade, generation after generation, these Pony Cars have taken turns holding Top Dog honors, which any internet forum will boast about, or make excuses for, depending on your side. But whoever the champ is, it will last for only a few years at best. Each and every time one car gets beat, inevitably, it gets right back up bigger and badder than before. In the latest iteration of the Mustang versus Camaro battle royale, the Ford has soundly beaten the last-gen Camaro with its wickedly powerful 5.0-liter 435-horsepower Coyote engine. But that was last year.
For 2016, the Camaro has risen from the ashes of war like a Phoenix… A seriously powerful wild-horse-eating-Phoenix. Everything about the new Camaro, specifically the SS, has been upgraded, improved, or redesigned to make it a more efficient Mustang killer. The biggest change is one that no one can see from the outside. The Camaro gets a change in DNA thanks to a hand-me-down from its more sophisticated big brother, Cadillac. Built on the Alpha platform, the new Camaro could be thought of as a cheaper, sportier, ATS-V without all the needless luxury. The newly sculpted SS body shows off thousands of hours sitting in a wind tunnel, trying day after day, to find the most efficient design possible, while retaining its Pony Car roots. And, thankfully, it's not all function-over-form styling, as evidenced by the fantastically aggressive-looking hood or profile; the SS designers got it right. The Camaro looks more like its own car in this iteration than it has since its triumphant return from a seven-year hiatus in 2009. Now, instead of just looking like a retro-styled 1969 reboot, the 2016 version looks like a modern car with heritage cues from days gone by, instead of being from days gone by.
The interior of the Camaro is nicer than you might remember from your IROC-Z days; with its configurable digital screen seated between the tach and speedometer, you can summon up information about the car's oil pressure, battery charge, temperature, or even get navigational directions. The center-mounted infotainment screen should also make some former F-Body car owners green with envy; even if the screen seems a little off because of its slight downward tilt, presumably to fend off sun glare, it's still quite the upgrade. The seats are supportive, while the overall interior has a feeling of being a bit more upscale than in recent years. The 9-speaker Bose sound system is fantastic, and the wireless phone charging, Heads-Up Display, eight standard air-bags, and heated steering wheel give the SS owners plenty of bragging rights. There are still a few plastic bits here and there that do show some cost cutting, but nothing that a little romp on the gas wouldn't make you forget about.
The essence of any Pony Car doesn't lie within its cup holder count, nor its extraneous and miscellaneous digital gadgetry. No, the true nature of a Pony Car is measured by its gas pedal, and the roar of the engine. The new SS has heart, and then some. Having been arguably the luckiest younger sibling in automotive history, the Camaro has always had the good fortune of getting some very sweet Corvette hand-me-downs, and this model is no different. The SS starts life with a Vette-derived 6.2-liter all-aluminum, naturally-aspirated V8 code-named LT1. This direct-injected monster is the very same as it is in big brother, making a ghastly and very symmetrical 455 horsepower @ 6000 rpm and 455 pound-feet of torque @ 4400 rpm. Backing up that massive power is your choice of either a traditional six-speed manual transmission (the stuff dreams are made of), or an impressively-quick-but-still-not-as-satisfying 8-speed automatic. All that power gets channeled through a chassis that sports a front strut/rear multi-link suspension and a limited-slip rear differential. Gone are the old solid axle rear suspension days that would make you forget whether you were driving a sports car or a Jeep.
The Camaro SS lives up to its moniker. Traditionally, the Super Sport model should be a force to be reckoned with, and pity the pony that tries. 0–60 mph takes only a scant 4.0 seconds flat, 0–100 mph in only 9.3 seconds, through the quarter mile in a blistering 12.4 seconds @ 114.1 mph, on its way to a drag-limited top speed of 175 mph. Try that in your father's Z28. But the SS isn't just a one trick pony (get it? anyone?). Thanks to big Brembo 13.6-inch, 4-piston front, and 13.3-inch, 4-piston rear brakes, stopping from 60–0 mph takes only 115 feet, which by sports car standards is very good, but not great. We would like to see how much better that number gets with 6-piston Brembos up front. And around the slalom, the SS posts an impressive 0.97 g, which is a real testament to how far the Camaro has come as a true sports car. It wasn't long ago that you could have a dozen hot rod Camaros putting down 11-second quarter mile times, but couldn't handle their way around a Walmart parking lot without inducing understeer. Of course the upgrade in tire technology doesn't hurt either, with a set of Goodyear Eagle F1 Asymmetric 3 tires measuring 245/40R-20 up front, and 275/35R-20 out back.
On the road, the Camaro just feels solid. It does a fine job of connecting the road to the driver and being a wonderful conduit to fun and excitement. Credit the electric steering perhaps for a better overall feel, or maybe the 200 pound diet the SS was put on to get it down to 3,760 pounds, which isn't light, but compared to recent years and other cars in this class (cough… Challenger… cough…), is damn-near svelte. Or maybe its the 455 horsepower trumpeting through the dual-mode exhaust, which is technically an $895 option, but for all intents and purposes, should be standard. It could be that even with a base price of $42,295, and a sticker of almost 50k, the 2016 Camaro SS still feels like a bargain on some level. Sure the '16 Mustang GT is cheaper, but you better believe quite a number of those Blue Oval boys will be spending a lot of extra cash trying to track down a stock SS, so the money will probably be about even, if speed is what you're after. Maybe, just maybe, it's the way sitting in a car that has half a century's worth of history built into it feels new, and yet still so familiar. Or maybe it's the feeling of driving the current champion of the Mustang/Camaro Civil War, and the anticipation of what Ford's answer is going to be, and then what Chevrolet's answer will be to Ford, and on and on… Maybe it's none of those things, or maybe it's all of those things. Either way, all we know is that we can do this for another 50 years with a big smile on our faces, even if it means throwing down with family at dinner time once in a while.

A type of cell the body uses to destroy cancer gets clogged by fat and stops working, findings suggest.
Again, it’s been a while. The slog from March to now has seemed much like rolling a rock up hill – any temporary relief being in the form of a smaller rock. No good stories. But this past weekend I remembered why I love this place.
The farm has an enormous garden, now shared by seven adults and three children. We never have it together to put the thing to bed in the fall, for the excellent reason that it continues to yield food until snowfall, and at that point picking things up is inefficient. This fact makes spring prep that more daunting, however. There are innumerable pieces of punky firewood to pick up, which have served the function of anchoring the cardboard mulch in places, but which disagree acutely with the tiller’s digestion. There are the monster stems of last year’s tomatoes and brussels sprouts and kale, plus baling twine using for tying things up (see tiller digestion, above), etc., etc. Once that is done, then several tons of manure and lots of lime need to be transported and spread, and then tilled in. Only then do we get down to the seasonal delights of Garden Planning This Year. Last year’s map is dragged out, last year’s errors and omissions rehearsed, and new, better, more successful plans laid. It is very fun, and once completed, my housemate and I were deputized to hitch up the buckboard and make the trek to the seed/set store. We plunged and wallowed there like newly freed yearlings – secure in the knowledge that we had measured each dimension of the plot, having carefully calculated in advance the linear feet needed of each separate item. All we needed to do was disport at this point, throwing bag after bag of seed potatoes into the hopper, flat after flat of this and that into the wagon. We swam and splashed in the tomatoes. And just for good measure on the way home, we stopped at a local farm and chose more stuff – advanced tomatoes with little fruits set already, on the theory that these would egg the younger ones on – sort of like toilet training among siblings.
Once back with our plunder, the games began. We all assembled under the direction of our Gardening Poo-bah, and received instructions. One of our number, however, dislikes garden soil. So he was deputized to clean out the fish pond, on the theory that he and the younger kids would have fun catching the fish and frog for safekeeping, putting them in cool safety in pots under the rhubarb leaves while the draining and cleaning part proceeded. This man was dressed in white pants. You can just imagine the progression….and as it happened, the only thing he likes less than dirt is amphibians: when he caught sight of (the very large) Rupert the Frog, he emitted a cry and fell back. That was it for him. All of us converged in a pack, informing him that only these sorts of toads had teeth, generally venomous, but not to worry so much about him but to watch for the water snake, etc. Several failed attempts to catch Rupert only increased our friend’s dismay, and our hilarity. It was tough to concentrate on planting onions, as I watched his person descend further and further into the wet and smelly depths, being instructed by him children the whole time on a better way to do things. By the time he was finished only his outline was visible under the slime coating, but I will say he did a great job. The pond is immaculate, the waterfall element restored, the fish and Rupert returned to their kingdom.
Meanwhile the garden part proceeded, accompanied by collective arbor repair, outdoor shower repair, and a myriad of small tasks needed for the improvement of the environment. The entire project took most of Saturday, and half of Sunday but by God, it is all in. The raised beds are immaculate, the herbs tidy, the climbing things planted next to fencing elements, the naughty area tarped so as to cook into obedience for next year. I remember standing up and looking around me at the bustle and camaraderie and thinking how much I appreciate this – the feeling of working together. It is the best feeling I know, I think – so rewarding yet undemanding. The feeling of real connection without any baggage.
Only one problem. We planted ten 45 foot rows of potatoes, and still had 140 feet worth of seed potatoes left over…..just a slight miscalculation, but the petty minded people who had NOT gone shopping made quite a mock about it. Never mind. Some were cooked up to eat (potatoes, not people) and the rest given to a neighbor whose garden I tilled later that second day. It would have taken her a month to dig up untouched sod by hand, and the aforementioned tiller made short work of it, churning up a respectable sized patch to a depth of 6-8 inches in three passes (except for that pesky ledge area).
And do you know, that same neighbor showed up here the next day, armed herself with a screw gun and a step stool, and went around the barns and indoor arena unscrewing and removing all the winter windows and shutters? I didn’t ask her to, but she just did it as a thank you for the tilling. I was so grateful – being too tired to do it myself but wincing about the heat on behalf of the horses.
In the best tradition of early to mid - 1800s writing, I will talk about the weather (that is, when I am not describing the change of clothes for every separate meal, each of which will be served to me by others). And, since I live in New England, the subject is always very timely and highly interesting. The topic is this – I will miss winter when it goes.
This flies in the face of every weather-related cultural imperative, I know. We are taught to groan our way from New Year’s Day through Easter, as the dreary and damp days crawl forward to the renewal of the growing season. But it is true – I will miss winter.
I will miss coming in wet and frozen from banging the ice out of water buckets, to the comfort of the wood stove. I will miss drying my mittens and stewing my dinner on the wood stove, which always makes me feel like I am getting something for free since the drying and cooking activities cost nothing more than the heating ones.
I will miss dragging in wood, even though it is messy and heavy and not always convenient. There is something compelling in the idea of effort rewarded in such a direct, immediate, and satisfying way. I carry in wood, and then I am warmed. What a perfect relationship between impetus and outcome. And after this exercise, my additional reward is sinking onto the couch with a book and feeling as if I absolutely deserve to read in peace and warmth.
I will miss the homey feeling of all the animals flopped in a circle around the wood stove and my person, after evening chores are done for the day. I love to watch their abandoned postures of comfort and relaxation…..cats snuggled up to each other and the dogs and vice versa, sleeping peacefully and quietly except for little kitty snores from the grey tabby.
I suppose this encomium has its roots in cell memory. The atavistic feeling of safety when there is enough wood piled by the cave mouth to keep the fire going until morning, or spring, or until the predators migrate elsewhere. There is nothing like it, and I really will miss winter – until next year when it will certainly come back.
I know, it’s been a while since I wrote. Can’t think where the time has gone, actually. This time of year, dealing with the every day tasks seems to take all my available energy. For example, there was a stretch of terrible, terrible ice. The parking lots, roads, and turnouts were bad enough that a human (me) had trouble staying upright on two feet, and the horses with four had equal difficulty. All we could do for them is spread the paths and approaches with manure and used bedding, plus make a little fan-delta in the entrance to the turnouts so that at least they could get into the pasture from the barn with relative safety. Once in, the hay was strewn about in the lower part of the pastures on what was left of the snow pack, but to arrive there, the poor things had to traverse the ice sheets. Luckily, all the horses had enormous common sense, and took their time. Even so, I had to avert my eyes from their hesitancy….what a horrible turn of weather. I would so much prefer snow to this constant rain/melt and then freezing.
The manure trails snake around all the place and are a sight to see. I am not proud, believe me, to have the property characterized by these trails. They are lumpy and preserve the ice underneath and now that melt has occurred, they actually stick up in their manure-ey nature above their surroundings – little manure dykes leading from one place to the next. On the other hand, they are still safe havens when the new melt freezes overnight and then gets snowed on (like last night), concealing newly treacherous footing. I suppose you could compare them to ostomy belts or surgical trusses – un-lovely but really useful in managing daily life. It is also hard to remember from one year to the next that the mess really does clean up. The rain washes away the manure, the mud does still grow grass, and the bleakness of winter does – every year – give way to spring’s gentle greens. At least I prod myself to remember this when I exit the house, since there is no place at all to which to avert my eyes – it is a 360 degree mess.
Fortunately the burn pile got done. This is an annual event, sort of like taxes, which is long avoided because of the onerous nature of the duty. It takes a number of people to organize themselves to do it, as well as a permit which may or may not be still good on the day intended, since burning is very weather dependent. The weather cooperated, at least, and I was fortunate to have guests here for a few days who were Captive To My Will in this matter. Out they went after a seductively good breakfast, to drag branches from the stone walls and the pastures (courtesy of the last wind and ice storms), tractor them down to the pile, and then to stuff feed and shavings bags into one another for kindling. Managing the burn pile is a high art – you need to get it consolidated from its year long strewn and spread out state, and then lift enough of it up to ram the kindling bits as far into a central cave as possible, all the time consulting the wind direction to make sure the light point is facing into the wind. Once well lit, frequent visits are necessary to make sure the flames are not being naughty and sneaking into anything they shouldn’t, and then once the center is burned out, return visits are necessary to push the pile up so that outlying brush gets burnt. It takes a day, at least, to get the thing done and the best is rainfall soon after, since the pile will smolder for a long time. As you can see, a complicated task. But the feeling afterwards is very good. Everything looks cleaner and tidier – which it is, in fact.
Add to all of this the need for wood to be brought in several times a day, and you have the prescription for late winter ick. There is good news, however. All horses are healthy and getting on really well – and it is a pleasure at the end of the day after chores to be walking down the hill and looking at the New Barn and indoor arena, all lit up and cozy looking in the twilight. It makes me happy that it is so well used by people who otherwise would not be able to hang with their horses.
Once upon a time, in a galaxy far, far away…… well, actually in Montevideo, Uruguay, I set out for my normal Saturday at Club Hipico Uruguayo, my mecca – my true home, the place where I spent every waking moment.
Backstory: my parents had gone gallivanting – again – leaving us four kids home alone with some easily fooled caretaker. This time they were in Peru, visiting Machu Picchu, and there they ran into some other Americans from the north shore of Long Island with whom they had – mirabile dictu – good friends in common. Lee and Dick Goldberg - or something like that – and their common friend was one of my mother’s girlhood chums. So naturally my parents invited them home to Montevideo for Christmas, and thus they all arrived together.
My mother found out that Lee liked riding and horses, and so she volunteered me – at 13 years old – to take Lee with me to the Hipico. Lee seemed really old – she was probably in her 30’s – but I sighed and scuffed and agreed. So early Saturday I got her up and we left the house and walked to the highway and I stuck out my thumb in order to hitchhike to the Club. I don’t think my mother actually considered how I got ordinarily got there, or how I was going to get Lee there – she probably believed her hospitality chores completed in arranging for me to take Lee at all. Even though I wasn’t paying much attention, I did notice Lee looking a little nervous about the hitchhiking thing, so I airily assured her that I did this all the time alone and had never had a problem. Really. A truck duly stopped, and we two climbed into the front bench seat and for THE FIRST TIME EVER the driver got grabby and rude. I remonstrated, yelled at him, and demanded to be let off, which he did. Lee was very quiet. I stuck my thumb out again, and the next truck stopped, invited us in to the front seat, and I declined, saying that we would prefer to ride in back. He tried to persuade us differently, but I over-rode him as Lee and I began climbing up the tires and the sides of the truck bed. We hoisted ourselves over, to find a full cargo of offal. If you don’t know the definition of this, picture several large piles of differing cow insides plus a stack of flayed skulls. Lee was now white, as well as quiet, but the helpful truck driver snaked his hand out the window with a roll of paper towels for our hitchhiking convenience which I thought was very nice of him. Lee perched on the side of the truck with her feet drawn up under her as tightly as possible. She did not appear to appreciate the towels.
We duly arrived, and I busied myself getting her mounted on one of my horses. We were finally in the saddle, and a few minutes out of the stable, when I realized that Lee could not ride. At all. Lord knows what she thought she was doing, but she was helpless with this horse. I sighed loudly, and headed back in to get her re-mounted on one of the stables’ hacks – who rejoiced in the name of Viejo (“Old”) and with whom no one, even a corpse, could get into trouble. Off we went for the normal three hour ride through the woods, ending up on the beach where I asked her if she wanted to go swimming, since it was mid-summer (there) and quite warm and we and the horses were sweaty. She said no. I said okay, but I am going swimming so I stripped naked and sprinted into the sea with my horse (the beach was deserted) and cooled off nicely. Came back to an even quieter Lee whose eyes were now very averted from me.
We meandered home, since we had arranged to meet Dick and my parents around lunch time for the traditional Saturday meal at the Club. We finally rounded the corner of the approach, and there the three of them were, looking variously anxious and annoyed. Upon spotting them Lee THREW herself out of the saddle and hobbled at speed to her husband, crying “Dick, Dick, Dick” in a piteous voice. When she reached him she collapsed against him. He clutched her, looking daggers at me, and my parents simultaneously roared at me “What did you DO to her?” I was genuinely bewildered….”Nothing!!”, I said.
In the days afterward Lee and Dick seemed to enjoy their stay a bit better. Mom consciously did not involve me much with them. Lee’s only comment, apparently, was that she thought I might have a hard time fitting in back in the States when the time came. And she was right.
We are still technically in the holiday season, so here is a belated farm Christmas story. My former housemate was (still is) a seriously playful person who loved Christmas and had many family traditions around it. One of them was a poem about Santa Mouse. Not many people now know the story/poem (it is at the bottom of the page for your convenience) but he knew if by heart and would recite it to complete strangers at the drop of a hat. Years ago he had also carved little sculptures of the significant events in the story – a little sardine can bed with a praying mouse beside it, a mouse holding a piece of cheese, a giant mittened hand holding an astonished mouse, and as the final piece, the mouse dressed as Santa Mouse, with little black boots and a red belted suit and hat and a teeny little pouch of presents on his back. Unbearably cute.
That year, we had gotten a new dog – not a puppy, but an 18 month old rescue dog, very large, who had spent six months in a no kill shelter before we found him. He was /is an awesome dog, but there was definitely a learning curve in his socialization skills. Close upon Xmas, the dog and I were in my housemates’ quarters while they were in full spate of decorations for the house. I had my back turned, but suddenly heard the ominous sound of crunching, and whirled to see Santa Mouse in the dog’s jaws – who was chewing and happily unaware of the impending firestorm. My housemate’s face was a tsunami – he screamed and yanked the remains from the dog’s jaws, to find the little boots and the little hat chewed off and teeth marks everywhere else. One look, and I hustled us smartly out of the room, but I was in a panic. What to do?
I instantly called my sister – when she lifted the phone I said in quiet desperation, “The dog just ate Santa Mouse – what am I going to do?” She said instantly “Oh Jesis Gawd, Oh Jesis Gawd” because she knew the magnitude of the disaster. “What am I going to do?” I repeated…. She said ” GET PIE!”
(Back story: my housemate was a serious eater, and really did not like to share his food. One famous anecdote was of him getting a blueberry pie at one point, and hiding it in his sock drawer so that no one else would get any. My sister’s suggestion was genius.)
“Right”, I said, and streaked out to the car to race down the hill to our local provisioning place. I grabbed the last pie in the case (fortunately home baked) and raced back up the hill and into the house. Then I waited, and soon my housemate came stumping around the corner with a VERY bad look on his face that boded no good either for me or the dog. So I hid behind the door and stretched my arm around it, with the pie balanced on my trembling palm. And that is he what he saw when he came in the house. – just a pie hanging in space. A moment of tense stillness, and then he burst out laughing – and took the pie. The phrase duly passed into family history, and in fact the next year someone made me a pie plate with the legend inscribed on the plate – Get Pie.
Once there was a little mouse, who didn't have a name. He lived in a great big house, this mouse, the only mouse in the whole wide house. He day dreamed he had playmates who were friendly as could be. The little girls would bring their dolls, and dress up and have tea. The boys would play at cowboys or Eskimo or Spanish. But when he tried to touch them like a bubble they would vanish. Now through the years this little mouse had saved one special thing. A piece of cheese- the kind that makes an angel wants to sing. And so that night as he brushed his teeth and washed his tiny paws. He said my goodness no-one gives a gift to Santa Claus. So he ran to get his piece of cheese and after he had found it, Some paper from some chewing gum he quickly wrapped around it. And then he climbed in bed and dreamed that he was lifted high, And woke up to find that he was looking right in Santa's eye. Thank you for my gift he said now tell me what's your name, I haven't any said the mouse. You haven't that's a shame. You know I need a helper as I travel house to house. And I shall give a name to you, I'll call you Santa mouse. So here's your beard and here's your suit and here's each tiny shiny boot. You mustn't sneeze and you mustn't cough, Now put them on and we'll be off. Then over all the rooftops on a journey with no end, Away they went together, Santa and his tiny friend. And so this Christmas if you please, Beneath that tree that's in your house, Why don't you leave a piece of cheese, You know who'll thank you, SANTA MOUSE!

The disclosures that had to be made that weren’t made with bogus information A former assistant FBI director called it a “serious, serious matter.”
.In the HPSCI outline it specifically notes the targeting of U.S. individual Carter Page was NOT a FISA Title VII search request…………So under what Title was it filed under, nobody has said what title, if it was filed under Title I of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, the FBI and DOJ could go after anyone with ties to Trump and Co, this whole thing stinks, I believe the truth will come out soon !!!!!!!
I can’t be sure but I’m thinking Nunes did cover that in his interview with Brett Baier, on Friday, and I don’t remember what it was.
What is disconcerting is the extent the Mueller probe has undertaken. Even Gowdy thinks there are enough concerns for Mueller as he mentions the “Trump Jr meeting” and Cambridge Analytica as, evidently, worthy of further consideration.
From what I can gather Mercer is with Cambridge, and also “Breitbart”. I guess the investigation is “concerned” with some data analytics. There certainly wasn’t a concern when it was reported how Google were going to use their massive data collection in order to elect Obama. The more I read and find out it appears anything and everything associated with Republicans is being investigated. This really calls into question the reasoning Mueller has “picked” certain individuals on his team. And, it’s even more suspicious to know Rosenstein instructs Mueller on any parameters, orally. We damned well better not find out there are No records of these discussions. This is one relevant point that Rosenstein should be confronted with at his next appearance.
According to Gowdy’s interview the FISA court apparently was given the information regarding Page and the FBI from 2013. Page Does admit the FBI interviewed him in that case. Everything in the Page affair is getting more and more suspicious.
I forget who it was, but a person with experience in these matters suggested having the DC office involved so deeply in such a matter was unprecedented. Normally cases like this are done at the Field Office level. It’s still unknown exactly what and how the FISA declassified documents relate to this. Along with that release was a host of compendium documents from different departments. I have yet to review those simply because there is such a volume of information to review on so many levels. I do get the distinct impression that very few, and maybe most Members of Congress, even know about those documents, especially since no one even remotely references them.
One thing is for certain and that is Comey’s own testimony of his animus for Trump. It wouldn’t be out of the realm of possibilities he could or would be complicit in some unscrupulous affair. He has already given some indication of that capability in the Ashcroft affair, using “altruism” as a pretext. In reading different sources it definitely appears he was very dishonest in his remarks before the Congress, told by certain individuals who were there that Comey was unaware of.
http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/372233-nunes-memo-raises-question-did-fbi-violate-woods-procedures
The Democrat Party, by its very nature, fights against the exposure of liars and corruption within the government. It thrives on use of them. Their Machiavellian posture is obvious; If it works for us, do it…we’ll cover it up.
Propitiously, Hillary lost the election. The Democrat Party’s fear of being exposed evoked the quoted comment, “We’re f**ked!” Indeed, their biggest fear is becoming a reality, due largely to the Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress. This must be maintained in 2018 in order to continue the effort to contain the socialist movement called “progressive”.
No one is saying the obvious about the memo; it implicates Hillary! The memo makes her look like a little girl with a cookie jar on her lap and chocolate all over her face. Hillary bought the DNC. Hillary was and IS the DNC. She was the one with the vested interest in the results of the phony dossier. Comey may have frustrated justce on the email issue, but here’s a brand new charge to lay against her. On another note, for a person of Christian faith, it is not possible to view the Trump win without attributing it to Divine intervention. Just ask Franklin Graham.

Everybody in the world has jumped on this bandwagon already, I'm amazed I made it this long tbh! In case you've been living under a rock though, Stitch Fix is a personal styling service that sends you clothes in the mail. Items are hand picked by a stylist for you based on your profile and notes/requests. The styling fee is $20 per box and that cost is applied to any items you choose to purchase. They make it super easy to return any items you don't love by including a pre-paid envelope. I always thought it was a monthly subscription but it turns out you can choose to have boxes - or Fixes - sent less often depending on your needs. You can even choose just one shipment like I did if money is tight and/or inconsistent.
I went back and forth quite a bit, trying to decide whether I could really justify paying for a Fix right now. I signed up for an account but didn't schedule my shipment. A few days later I received an email promo code to waive the $20 styling fee. I decided not to look a gift horse in the mouth and used that code to get this box for free, planning to only buy an item if I really, truly loved it.
Have I mentioned before how much I love getting mail? Packages, letters, cards. So long as it's not a bill, I'm happy. When my Stitch Fix box arrived, I was beyond happy! I think you can peek ahead of time with your tracking code but I didn't do that. In fact I don't think I ever got a tracking code... Anyway, when it arrived I tore it open and saw this:
I'm a sucker for cute packaging and I have to admit, I just love that blue geometric theme they've got going on. You can see the return envelope there on top. Folded up inside it I found a note from my stylist, Harley, a price list for each of my pieces, and a little styling inspiration:
Before we get to these photos, I need to apologize upfront - I'm in no way, shape, or form a fashion blogger. I didn't style cute outfits for you. I didn't even think far enough ahead to polish the mirror. So, sorry if you're offended by my yoga pants and Target tee, or the spots randomly floating in some of these pics... But if you are, you're on the wrong blog buster! Okay, onward.
I'm pretty meh about these. They're cute in a very basic way and if I didn't already own some basic brown sandals I might have been more enthused, but at $60 they were a no-go for me. I tried them on to be able to give feedback about the fit but didn't even bother to snap a picture.
I knew right off the bat this was not for me. I'm not a big fan of short sleeve dresses and I don't like my flowy skirts to be any shorter than maxi length. Trying it on proved me right, I hate what it does to my waist and stomach... Maybe if I were in the early stages of pregnancy this would be something I'd go for, but I don't need clothes that make me look pregnant when I'm not.
This top was also underwhelming on the hanger, but I liked it quite a bit when I put it on. There's a cute detail ribbon and black panel on the back - sorry for not getting a better shot of that - but the black was not jersey knit like the rest of the top. I don't know my fabrics well, but it was crepey and a little scratchy and kinda ruined the vibe for me. Had it been jersey knit, I think I would have had a harder time sending this one back, but $54 for a tee is a little beyond me these days.
Now this is my jam! I love cardigans and this is one of those cozy, drapey styles that's also office-appropriate. This color is great, a beautiful burnt orange/red that really makes me long for fall. I agonized over this a bit... As much as I love it, I don't think I can justify spending money on it when I have no less than three nearly identical items in my closet right now. I don't think $48 is a bad price for this and with the $20 styling fee applied, it's a steal but I returned it anyway. I'm definitely keeping the info on this one though, when I do have more clothes money to spend I'm gonna find it and make it mine!
I also really had a hard time sending these back. I sold a ton of Kut jeans when I was working at Nordstrom and I love their products. This teal color is beautiful and although they are "Toothpick Skinny" they are surprisingly comfortable. I know that photo makes my thighs look massive but trust me, it's camera angle. In person these jeans are very flattering. But with a few pair of blue denim skinnies in my closet I just couldn't see spending $78 (or even $58) on these. However, I did mention that I'd love to see them in a warmer or bolder color in the future. I'm all about colored skinnies and loose tops right now!
So there you have it. Even though I didn't purchase any items, I really liked my Fix and I cannot wait to schedule another one in the future. If you want to check it out for yourself, you can use my referral link. Let me know in the comments what you thought of this Fix, and if you subscribe to Stitch Fix already tell me some of your favorite items you've received!
2016 has already been a year for big changes. I've moved a few hundred miles and plan to do it again in a few months, I'll be welcoming my niece to the world soon, and *hopefully* starting adventures in graduate school. So, I decided I need an epic project to help me chronicle this year. Enter the 2016 Temperature Blanket! Each day I will crochet a row reflecting the temperature of the day and at the end of the year I'll have a map of sorts of my year.
I didn’t decide to do this until March so I had quite a bit of catching up to do! I’ve chosen the Big Twist Value yarns at Joann's Fabrics because I know I’ll be needing a lot of yarn and it it the most affordable option with colors I like. I’m using wunderground.com for daily temperatures and because I’ll be spending the majority of the year in northern states, I’m using the daily high. After looking at averages, I’ve broken down the temps from 40 to 89 in increments of 5. I don’t expect to see much 90+ this summer but if I do, I may have to find some more red and pink options. I found the pattern on Ravelry.com, a Granny Ripple that I just love!!
I'm almost at the end of March and the blanket is almost big enough to cover my queen sized bed... I'm debating whether to make a few different blankets for every three or four months or to just let it be and end up with one very loooonnggg blanket... we'll see!
Well, I've been away from it a while, huh? In May, I ended up having to put my precious Stella to sleep after she was diagnosed with cancer and honestly I just couldn't bear to look at this blog and see her name all over the place.
But, life goes on. I finished school, did a few awesome shows, and moved a few hundred miles. And now I find myself missing blogging. So, I've decided to get back into it. Who knows how regularly... who even knows what I'll blog about. I keep trying to pin it down, I thought maybe I'd start totally fresh with a whole new blog on a different platform. But I just feel like I want to write about anything and so Runs 'n Stuff seems appropriate for now.
So, dear reader, thank you for being here. Thank you for sticking around or for popping by, I hope you'll be back again!
For any of you who don't see my Facebook posts, I thought I'd update a bit about Stella. She has been in the hospital since last Thursday with some sort of infection in her liver and gallbladder as well as esophageal problems. Because I'm still edgy and stressed and don't feel like making myself cry againsomemore, I'm going to be super lazy and just cut and paste from Facebook. Please don't be offended, I'll get back to real blogs once she starts recovering and I can think about things without losing it...
April 30: Stella is back in the hospital today. Blood work indicated possible liver damage so she will have an ultrasound tomorrow morning. Since she hasn't been able to keep down much food or water the past few days, she's staying there overnight on IV fluids. Your positive thoughts are deeply appreciated and if you've got any extra cash laying around I'd be happy to take that off your hands!
May 3: Yesterday Stella was transferred to the emergency clinic. She will be seen by the internist early Monday morning and in the meantime they're keeping her comfortable and hydrated. This morning they called to update me on her overnight progress - while they were sure to let me know she isn't dramatically improved, they were very pleased with her demeanor this morning and that she had been able to keep some food down finally!
May 4: Stella met with the Internal Medicine Specialist today and had another ultrasound performed. It looks like she may have two infections - one in her gallbladder and one in her kidney - and the doctors are unsure as of now whether or not the infections are related or not. We're waiting on results from blood work and urine cultures and hopefully will know soon just what has infected this poor pup.
Meanwhile, Stella is brave and strong and everyone at the clinic assures me she is being her usual well-behaved and sweet self!
May 6: Stella is going in for a gallbladder removal now and will have a feeding tube inserted as well. Your prayers and positivity are very much appreciated as we wait for news from the surgeon!! Update: The surgery went well and she is resting comfortably. Fingers and toes crossed she is finally on her way to recovery.
If you are able to help, any donations you can make would really mean the world - #SaveStella! So far her bill is at $9500 and that's not including the almost $8000 we already spent on her knees. And if you would help me spread the word to your friends and family it would be so deeply appreciated!!
She had her staples taken out Saturday morning, it was traumatic - lots of shivering, big eyes, but she was a champ and didn't squirm or cry. We drove through McDonalds on the way home for some french fries - one of her favorite treats - and then she took a very long nap. That night I gave her some rice with her kibble. She gulped it down but then puked it back up a few minutes later, it was hardly even chewed so I didn't think much of it, just figured she had eaten too fast. I gave her some water and left her a little bit of plain rice which she never ate.
Sunday she ate and kept down some kibble mixed with canned food and seemed totally normal other than her poop being a little sickly looking - kinda green/yellow and slimy, nothing too out of the ordinary for a dog with an upset tummy the night before. Monday however, she didn't eat any of her food, just a few treats and some chunks of bread from my lunch. That night she woke me up around three gag/coughing up water and spit all over the carpet. Again, not totally out of the usual for her. She's not a big fan of dog food and often goes a day or more without eating in hopes of breaking me and scoring some people food, and if she goes too long without eating she'll spit up water and stomach juices. But Tuesday afternoon I gave her some canned food again which she loved. Then fifteen or so minutes after eating, she drank some water and puked everything onto the carpet. I cleaned her up and took her out back in case she had any more to spit up. When she peed, I noticed her urine was very dark, almost an orange/brown color and that got me a little nervous.
I called the vets office to ask their advice and they said to go ahead and bring her in, just in case. They checked her vitals, listened to her eating/puking history and the vet gave her an anti-nausea injection and sent us home with a few meds. We've got Sucralfate that dissolves in water to a chalky, cloudy mix that she takes two hours before any food. The vet says this is to coat her GI tract. Then we have an antacid, Famotadine, and a pain killer. She had been taking Metacam for the pain in her leg but it apparently commonly causes GI issues so I had stopped that one on Monday and the vet told me not to resume. Instead she gave us Tramadol in case Stella is still experiencing pain in her leg, in addition to any pain she may be feeling from her tummy.
She told me to give it a day and if Stella's not feeling better by this afternoon to come back in for some blood work and possibly an x-ray. I'm trying to stay calm, but we may be looking at ulcers or liver problems which is totally terrifying. I decided to stay home from my classes today to keep an eye on Stella, and also because this two-hour gap between meds and food is really not compatible with my classe schedule. So far today she's had a little water, a very little canned food with rice and no puking. She pooped for the first time since Sunday, it was very runny but normal colored, and her urine looked less orange, more dark yellow today so I am hopeful this is a stomach bug and she's on the mend! My fingers are permanently crossed for the day, this poor pup has been through so much already I don't want her to have to deal with any other major injuries or illness!
Birchbox is probably my favorite subscription box of all. It's only $10 a month, less if you pay for multiple months at a time and they frequently have special offers to either reduce the cost or earn more points (points = money to spend in their shop). For that $10 you get 5 or 6 sample size products, things like makeup, hair care, cleansers, and more. I consistently get great boxes and I was so pleased with this months box that I just had to share it!
In recent months, Birchbox has started letting subscribers choose one of their samples or choose a curated box (or do neither and be surprised). I really love the sample choice, I enjoy having a little control and a little surprise mixed together. This was the first month that I actually chose one of the curated boxes. There were two to choose from, both Mad Men themed - I guess the show is ending? I've never watched it so I had no idea what to expect in the boxes and was planning on choosing an eyeshadow trio as my sample choice. Then I saw the boxes! Guys, the Mad Men New York box was made for me! Check it out:
How cute is that print? Pink and purple are two of my favorite colors and I really dig the mod floral motif.
I love having travel sized toiletries around to grab when I'm packing for trips and this is the first small shave cream I've received. I'll be visiting my sister and her family this summer and this is definitely coming with me.
I have been wanting to try this forever! I've read rave reviews and have been hoping every month for ages that it might show up in a sub box. I finally got lucky!
I received a Liz Earle face scrub in a previous box and loved it so I'm excited for a chance to try something new from this brand. And let's be honest, who doesn't need a nice eye soother now and again?
This is hands down my favorite product in this box, maybe my favorite product I've received from Birchbox, ever! I actually chose it as my sample in my March box and was thrilled to be able to snap up another. This oil smells like heaven and tames my frizz so well. I use it 2 or 3 times a week and have only used about half of March's sample so a little goes a long way.
I received this exact blush in my May 2013 box and was perfectly happy to get another. I'm not a big blush girl but I do wear it from time to time, like when I'm in a show, and this is a great corally peachy color for me. I tried to swatch it for you:
While water resistant blush might not seem like a thing I need in my life, it actually is nice. Since working at Disney, my body has learned to sweat the instant I start dancing so it's nice to have stage makeup that can hold it's own.
What an awesome box right?! I can't give a good estimate of the value of the Beauty Protector sample as the mL are not listed, but even without accounting for that I received more than $25 worth of samples for only $10. Not too shabby!
Birchbox partnered with Rifle Paper Co. this month and the box they designed was just so beautiful! (I was disappointed the Mad Men themed box was different, even though it was pretty too.) Since I wasn't going to receive that Rifle Paper Co. box, I bought the tote bag they designed which is just too darling!
Doesn't that just make your heart sing?! If I've piqued your interest in Birchbox now, I encourage you to try them out!
Today we're 10 days post-surgery and I just noticed the best sign: Stella is scratching herself with her healing leg! You're like 'what?' In the past week that she's been home, she has hardly put any weight on that leg, won't let me touch it or look at it, and basically hasn't moved it more than totally necessary. So the fact that she's using it today is a great sign that she's on her way to recovery.
Another sign: she's completely fed up with her confinement, her e-collar, and her stitches. This afternoon she cried for 15 full minutes because I refused to let her pull out the stitches.
We'll go back to the vet this weekend and if he says all is going well, the stitches will come out. With the last leg, this was when things got really frustrating for Stella. The fur growing back through the scar or something must have really itched because I was for ever catching her biting at her incision. So we're not going to be done with the e-collar for a bit, but once we are, we're practically home free!
Oh and yes, she did have a bladder infection. It's all cleared up now, thank goodness. I guess if she had to get an infection, I'm glad it happened when she was already on antibiotics and pain meds... less discomfort for her (and fewer expenses for me).

While time consuming, copy editing is the most important job you have as an author, after writing your story. Before the groans start, let me tell you that copy editing is a skill that be learned and gets stronger with practice. There are multiple methods for copy editing, and you should use multiple ones to catch the most errors. Here are ones that I taught my students, and that I use for my writing.
1. Start at the end of the text to proofread for spelling and punctuation errors. Read backwards to eliminate the problem of reading what should be there and what is actually there. According to Martha Watson Smitherman, education director for National Association of Legal Secretaries (NALS) of Missouri, the “brain relies more on the shape of a word than its actual spelling...” (25) Focus your brain to read the words on the printed page. You will catch more misspelled words this way. Punctuation errors are also more evident when reading backwards. The flow of the text does not interfere with the proofreading like reading from the beginning would.
2. Read the text aloud to be able to hear how one sentence flows into another sentence and one paragraph leads into another paragraph. This copy editing method allows you to focus on grammar usage and punctuation marks such as commas. Don’t be embarrassed to use a ruler to focus on one line at a time. By covering up the rest of the text, your brain is prevented from anticipating what is coming in the next line.
3. Listen to someone else read the text aloud. This method allows the listener to focus on the words and content. Follow along on a separate copy of the text. Catch sentence structure and flow problems and reveal content weaknesses by reading the written text as it is read out loud. According to Smitherman, “Things that one person tends not to notice will jump out at the other.” (25) If you have no one to read to you, set your computer to speak the text by accessing the preference menu. The voice is different, but it allows you to hear the text if another person is not present.
4. Write out a checklist for proofreading and correcting the mechanics of your story. Include, at the least, the following items: spelling, capitalization, punctuation, grammar usage, and sentence structure.
Check spelling by using spell check on the computer and using a dictionary for unfamiliar words. Watch for homonyms, those words that are spelled differently but pronounced the same.
Check for capitalization not just at the beginning of sentences but of proper nouns within sentences.
Read up on comma rules as these are the most misused of all punctuation marks. Check each comma in your text to see if its usage follows a rule.
Make sure your story conforms as much as possible to proper grammar conventions. Check for subject-verb agreement and proper grammar.
Determine if sentences are complete thoughts or fragments. Watch for sentences beginning with “because”, “and”, “so” and “then”.

Four days after rejecting of a similar measure sparked one of the biggest Wall Street sell offs ever, the House is expected to vote on a massive financial relief bill on Friday designed to unfreeze credit markets and restore stability to financial institutions.
Meanwhile, a Department of Labor report showed that non-farm payroll employment fell by 159,000 jobs in September compared to a revised decrease of 73,000 jobs in August. Economists had expected employment to fall by about 100,000 jobs compared to the decrease of 84,000 jobs originally reported for the previous month.
The U.S. dollar ticked higher against the euro and extended a yearly high amid ongoing fears the global credit problems may eventually lead to European Central Bank rate cuts. The greenback also strengthened against the sterling and yen, pushing gold's hedge appeal lower.
Crude oil prices also inched lower in early trading on Friday, adding to its recent slump. November oil fell to as low as $92.81 a barrel in overnight moves, a two-week intraday low.
The price of gold dropped sharply on Thursday in early U.S. trading and moved to its lowest level in nearly two weeks. Gold for November delivery moved to $844.30, down $43 on the session. The metal hit as low as $833.50 earlier in the day and tested its 20-day moving average.
The price of gold plunged by $43 Thursday's session, amid the dollar's sharp rise against the euro. The metal has given back its gains from earlier in the week when it soared as high as $915.30 after the House failed to get the necessary 218 votes to pass a $700 billion rescue plan.

Pending home sales rose 5.5% in February after falling 2.8% in January, the National Association of Realtors reported. That’s the highest level in close to a year.
The NAR said the rising stock market and steady hiring helped, as did fears from home buyers of rising interest rates. Read more on mortgage rates
The NAR forecasts a 2.3% rise in existing-home sales and a 4% rise in median home prices for 2017, after a 3.8% rise in existing sales and a 5.1% price rise in 2016.
The financial markets from the perspective of global stocks have performed somewhat mixed on this historic day, alternating between both buying and bearish momentum but there are some signs of investors searching for safety assets with the Japanese yen noticeably higher against its major trading partners and gold showing more marginal gains.
We have seen time and time again in recent times that the Japanese yen becomes a trader’s best friend in times of uncertainty and depending on how stubborn the prolonged negotiations take between Theresa May and her EU counterpart, perhaps Brexit uncertainty will be viewed as another reason for investors to hedge on gold this year after the precious metal has already gained just over $100 since the opening day of trading in 2017.
While all eyes are understandably on the British pound, it is the euro that looks set to be a surprise contender for the loser of the currency markets today following the eurodollar succumbed to selling pressure above 1.08 to looking at risk to slipping below 1.07.
You could on one hand say that investors are pricing in the likelihood that Europe itself is going to enter its own period of uncertainty by losing a member of the European Union, while others could say that the losses in the eurodollar represents a withdrawal of gains after spiking heavily as trading for the week commenced after President Trump was defeated in his quest at replacing Obamacare.
I personally stand by my view that the euro is grossly oversold, or you could say underbought on an economic basis but the political risks around Europe this year does also support the bias that the Euro remains at risk especially if Marine Le Pen’s campaign to win the election in France achieves a bid.
The British pound is as you would expect where all the major action is happening, but there are signs of a somewhat tug of war taking place with the GBP/USD alternating between both buying and selling momentum after suffering late in trading yesterday and overnight.
It is no hidden secret at all that the market is short on the sterling with short options on the pound recently at historic levels, but traders still need to be careful and inherit appropriate risk management strategies whether that is hedging towards the Japanese yen or whatever because it is not unknown for the market to suddenly bounce the other direction if the currency encounters a sudden squeeze.

Getting back into the routine of school after winter break can be challenging. This is the time to order your books, purchase your parking pass for the new semester, and any other materials or supplies you need to replenish to make sure you continue to do well with your graduate studies.
Before the semester begins it may seem that you have a lot to do and you’re “on break” but here is a list of a few things you may or may not have thought of to do to ensure you begin the next semester smoothly.
Clean and organize school stuff. Recycle all those articles and papers you printed that you do not need. If you believe they could be useful in the future, organize them by putting them in a folder so that you can easily access them later.
Check your emails! In graduate school you may find that even though you are “on break” not everyone else is. There may be emails regarding your financial aid, research, volunteer, internship, or even employment opportunities. For example, I recently checked my email, and the initial application window for a position was only 6 days. If I had waited to check my email, I would have missed my opportunity to apply.
Clean and stay up to date with your housekeeping. Although you are on break, you do not want to start the semester having chores to do on the first day. For example do all of your laundry, so that it is one less thing that you have to worry about when beginning the semester. Also do any other regular housekeeping tasks such as sweeping (vacuuming) floors.
Go grocery shopping and clean out your fridge. When you have a lot more time than during the semester, stock up with your food. Since winter break is a few weeks, our refrigerators may become bare because food does go bad. This is because we may travel during the holidays and any food that can not last a few weeks will need to be thrown out. I personally like to make sure that I purchase milk, fruits, vegetables and healthy snacks during this time.
Make a list of things you do not want to forget. This list can include everything aforementioned in this post. This list can also include anything else you feel that you need to do before the semester begins. I like to physically write my list down but you can do it however you like (i.e making the list in your phone).
These are just a few suggestions that work for me when beginning a new semester after winter break. Feel free to use them and good luck!
Spring semester has arrived! Despite the fact winter only recently began to feel and look like winter, it’s time to bounce back into the swing of things and begin and end the semester with a bang.

Clean Dirty Surfaces: The first tip in our tips of painting is to make sure you clean first. If you paint over dirty surfaces, the paint will chip off easily. This is especially important in areas such as: Kitchens, Bathrooms, Areas that receive a lot of skin contact, Rooms with non-water-soluble markings, Above heating registers. Trisodium phosphate or another prepaint cleaner can clean surfaces for the new paint. Once your cleaner is ready, wipe it on in a circular motion with a cloth. Start at the bottom and work your way up. Then you’re ready to move on to the smoothing or priming process.
One coat of paint usually won’t hide the underlying color and sheen on trim. And if you don’t sand the surface smooth between coats, the finish may have a grainy texture. For a smooth finish, sand the trim before applying each coat of paint. Sand the trim with a fine-grit sanding sponge. Sponges get into crevices where sandpaper can’t go and let you apply even pressure. Then apply the ﬁrst coat of paint, let it dry at least 24 hours, lightly sand it again for a completely smooth surface, and apply the second coat. After each sanding, vacuum the trim, then wipe it down with a tack cloth to remove the dust.
Mix Cans of Paint Beforehand.The same shade paint can vary in color, even if the cans come from the same manufacturer, and the differences can be noticeable once applied to a surface. If you have several cans that you’ll be using to paint a large area, you’ll want the same color everywhere.
Lap marks are those ugly stripes caused by uneven layers of paint buildup. They occur when you roll over paint that’s already partly dry. (In warm, dry conditions, latex paint can begin to stiffen in less than a minute!) The key to avoiding lap marks is to maintain a “wet edge,” so each stroke of your roller overlaps the previous stroke before the paint can begin to dry. To maintain a wet edge, start near a corner and run the roller up and down the full height of the wall, moving over slightly with each stroke. Move backward where necessary to even out thick spots or runs. Don’t let the roller become nearly dry; reload it often so that it’s always at least half loaded. Keep the open side of the roller frame facing the area that’s already painted. That puts less pressure on the open side of the roller, so you’re less likely to leave paint ridges.
Avoid having ‘heavy hands’ with your paintbrush. Sometimes the pressure that you apply with a stroke can make the difference between perfection and a mess. The heavier your pressure, the more your paints will blend and create ridges along the sides of your brushstrokes. Get familiar with how your light, medium, and heavy strokes look on the canvas and vary your pressure appropriately to achieve your desired effects.
Expect Touch-Ups. Once you’ve finished painting your walls, you might think that you’re officially done with the painting process. However, you would be wrong. Accidents will happen and over time, your painted walls might just show their age. If you’re in this situation, your solution will be to touch up your walls. If you’re in need of a touch-up, try the following: Thoroughly clean any stain first. Use a craft eraser to remove residue on painted walls. Use the feather technique with a small roller if you must paint. Use a brush to easily paint corners. Repaint the whole trim as they require higher gloss finishes.
Feather Out Paint. If you have to paint larger areas, such as ceilings, tall walls, or stairwells, your best method is to feather out the paint along edges that you can’t keep wet. This feathered coat technique will prevent any lap marks that may occur and prevent any areas from standing out. You can accomplish this technique by rolling the roller in different directions along the edge and applying less and less pressure as you go, which will feather out the paint. After completing one section, move on to the next section until you have finished painting the job. If a second coat is required, make sure you feather out the paint in the opposite direction to further prevent lap marks.
Make any color paint into fabric paint. You can get fabric ‘textile medium’ at most craft stores (I like the Anita’s brand). You just mix it with any color acrylic paint and it instantly turns it into fabric paint.

Varanasi is not the kind of city that can easily be summarized in one article…even one very long article, but I'm going to try. Varanasi is even more crazy and chaotic than Delhi, but the Varanasi vibe is spiritual rather than economic. This is a city that welcomes death with open arms.
We visited Varanasi in 2014 after spending 30 days in Nepal. We stayed at the Radisson Hotel within ...

Bentyl is used for treating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Bentyl is an anticholinergic. It works by blocking a chemical in the smooth muscle of the stomach and intestines, causing them to relax, which reduces cramping.
If you miss a dose of Bentyl, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.
Store Bentyl at room temperature, below 86 degrees F (30 degrees C). Protect from freezing. Store away from heat, moisture, and light. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep Bentyl out of the reach of children and away from pets.
you have inflammation of the esophagus due to acid reflux, loss of strength in the intestinal muscles, or chronic inflammation and ulceration of the bowel
Some medical conditions may interact with Bentyl. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have any medical conditions, especially if any of the following apply to you:
if you have chronic inflammation or ulcers of the bowel, diarrhea, enlargement of the prostrate, hiatal hernia, kidney or liver disease, a nervous system disease, overactive thyroid, or urinary blockage or retention
Some medicines may interact with Bentyl. Tell your health care provider if you are taking any other medicines, especially any of the following:
Metoclopramide or phenothiazines (eg, chlorpromazine) because their effectiveness may be decreased by Bentyl
This may not be a complete list of all interactions that may occur. Ask your health care provider if Bentyl may interact with other medicines that you take. Check with your health care provider before you start, stop, or change the dose of any medicine.
Bentyl may cause drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, or lightheadedness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Bentyl with caution. Do not drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.
Do not drink alcohol or use medicines that may cause drowsiness (eg, sleep aids, muscle relaxers) while you are using Bentyl; it may add to their effects. Ask your pharmacist if you have questions about which medicines may cause drowsiness.
Bentyl may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting; alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may increase these effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly, especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of these effects.
Bentyl should not be used in children younger 6 months; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been confirmed.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of using Bentyl while you are pregnant. Bentyl is found in breast milk. Do not breastfeed while taking Bentyl.

The Camford Junction group was hard at work on Camford Junction again last night. Progress is slow, but it is progress, nevertheless.
There was much discussion and head-scratching trying to work out the best shapes for baseboards for the curved ends of the fiddle yard that will allow for the 4 tracks, with a minimum radius of 36 inches, and with the tracks crossing baseboard joints as close to right angles as possible. We also want to provide a few inches of straight track at the joins to the straight baseboards at the front and rear of the layout, and increase the spacing of the tracks to allow for overhang of long coaches and wagons.
And I pressed on with joining up droppers with relays and frog switches for the TMD area on baseboard 2:

The eye can be analyzed with relative ease as to both its function and its structure. A functional examination consists of the capability to move in the orbit and the response of the pupil to light and lodging.
The function of the eye might be evaluated in numerous ways. The client may be asked to recognize illuminated letter or items of differing sizes on what is called the Snellen chart.
On the other hand, the examination of the structural part of the eye may be made in numerous methods. Stress within the eyeball is determined by a "tonometer." In certain illness, especially in glaucoma, the tension in the eyeball is increased significantly.
However, it ought to be well bore in mind that a patient with an eye problem might have other issues too. Frequently other physical conditions are primary and impact the eye as a effect. The look of the eye can alert the doctor and the patient to troubles in some disruptions of other parts of the body even before other signs present themselves.
Subsequently, one's reliance on sight is stressed when one faces a momentary or possible permanent loss of this vital sense. When restorative procedures are looked for, particular kinds of vision correction such as contact lenses or glasses are prescribed.
On the other hand, some people are bothered with that they have some framed lenses or contact lenses in front of their eyes.
For this factor, advanced surgeries were established to encourage reduced usage of contact lenses or glasses. One of which is the now popular LASIK eye surgery.
Essentially, LASIK eye surgery is the short-term for "Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis." Like its tangible counterpart, LASIK eye surgery is another kind of vision correction. The only difference is that with this kind of surgical treatment, one's vision is corrected completely.
With LASIK eye surgery, the refractive mistakes in the cornea are completely transformed. This can be done utilizing an "excimer laser."
The main function of this surgical treatment is to produce a threadlike, rounded "flap" in the cornea using a blade understood as "microkeratome." In a series of unfolding and laser processing, the cornea is finally reformed, permitting better the eye to direct more light into the retina.
Amidst the growing appeal of LASIK eye surgery, there are still disadvantages that individuals must understand. Probably, the primary reason that this type of eye surgical treatment has actually become well accepted is due to the fact that the majority of its cases had actually achieved success.
Due to the fact that LASIK eye surgery involves the operation of the retina, which is among the most sensitive portions of the eye, the majority of people say that the operation can be extremely dangerous.
In other words, a simple mistake might almost cause an person's life time loss of sight. It is crucial to think about lots of elements before choosing whether LASIK eye surgical treatment is the right corrective measure one has to undergo.
LASIK eye surgery may fix your vision but it does not necessarily suggest that it can provide you a twenty-twenty. Even if analytical reports reveal that 70% of the clients might have 20/20 vision, this does not always suggest they have perfect vision also.
Given all these things, it can be deduced that, in spite of the popularity of the operation, LASIK might not always be the ideal eye surgical treatment the method many people see it
Conversely, the examination of the structural part of the eye might be made in numerous ways. It ought to be well kept in mind that a patient with an eye problem might have other issues. Frequently other physical conditions are main and impact the eye as a repercussion. The appearance of the eye can notify the patient and the doctor to problems in some disturbances of other parts of the body even prior to other symptoms provide themselves.
Like its concrete counterpart, LASIK eye surgical treatment you can try here is another form of vision correction.

That feels like change in the making. I feel at home with these sort of initiatives going on all around me.
Sheffield can be proud of the hundreds of activities that make up Sheffield Environment Weeks, which has run for many years. They range from talks on a range of subjects, to projects like urban agriculture and wildlife conservation. In 2016 it won the category ´Small Group, Big Impact´ in the Sheffield ´Make a Difference´ Awards. If you want to volunteer see the timetable on the website.
A reminder that The Real Junk Food Project has various excellent volunteer-run projects, using food which would otherwise go to waste. The following operate on the basis of pay-as-you-feel:
Shareouse Market (49 Carlisle Street, S4 7LJ) open Tuesday–Saturday 12-2pm as a pay-as-you-feel store.
They also run Fuel For School, an educational programme helping primary schools to take direct environmental action and make a positive change in the local community, and they offer catering for conferences, parties, weddings and events from 5 – 350 people, including vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free options.
A reminder that Foodhall Café offers food that would have been thrown away, surplus donated by retailers, on a pay-as-you-feel basis. It is run by volunteers and encourages community engagement between the general public including students, homeless people, mental health groups, isolated people, people with addiction problems and people who need to access food.
You can help, whether by just visiting to eat and socialise, or maybe food preparation, or even playing the house piano.
The cafe opens Thursdays to Saturdays, there are also art workshops and reading groups, and some nights it becomes a DIY venue for fundraiser gigs.

For all those worrying about Shidduchim, love, or life in general, just remember – it could always be worse. At least we’ve eradicated smallpox; ironically, this most monstrous of God’s creations is the only disease that we’ve managed to eradicate:
Smallpox is believed to have emerged in human populations about 10,000 BC. The disease killed an estimated 400,000 Europeans per year during the closing years of the 18th century (including five monarchs), and was responsible for a third of all blindness. Of all those infected, 20–60%—and over 80% of infected children—died from the disease.
During the 20th century, it is estimated that smallpox was responsible for 300–500 million deaths. In the early 1950s an estimated 50 million cases of smallpox occurred in the world each year. As recently as 1967, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that 15 million people contracted the disease and that two million died in that year. After successful vaccination campaigns throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the WHO certified the eradication of smallpox in December 1979. To this day, smallpox is the only human infectious disease to have been eradicated.1
Indeed, the triumph over this ghastly demon is such a noble accomplishment, that Rav Yisrael Lipschütz singled out Edward Jenner as one of the most praiseworthy of gentiles for his pioneering work on smallpox vaccination:
Max Skelley of Havre de Grace retained his lead in the Havre de Grace Laser Winter Series sailboat races last Sunday.
The seasonal regatta, sponsored by the Havre de Grace Yacht Club, runs every Sunday from January to March on the upper Chesapeake Bay. Races pit an average of 16 single-handed sailboats against each other over a 1-mile course.
In the Winter Series, the course varies from a triangular course some weeks to a windward-leeward course other weeks.
In last Sunday's race, Skelley beat out Randy Eckman of Kennet Square, Pa., to take first. Jeff Scherpf of Havre de Grace was second, followed by ScottKulp and Bob Torr, both of Philadelphia. Dave Steark of Delaware wassixth.
"We have a bunch of short races in a series, which is how frost-biting (winter racing) is done. We're emphasizing boat handing more than boat speed," said Skelley, who taught many of the other racershow to handle the one-man sailboats.
A graduate of Havre de GraceHigh and St. Mary's College, Skelley, 25, is a former East Coast champion and has finished in the top five in national regattas several times.
Skelley, who operates Skelley's Sails in Havre de Grace, also competes nationally in races for bigger boats. He and Eckman are part of the crew on a five-man sailboat that has finished in the top 10nationally during the last two years.
This is one of the more cherished tenets of the environmental movement, but who knows what it means? In simple terms, it means to look at the entire planet, or ecosystem. Then consider what you can do within your own sphere of influence, however large or small it may be.
Since you can't run out and save the world, just start with yourself and what you can do in your own home. After all, what could be more local than that?
Here are just a few simple ideas that should not only help the planet over the long haul, but just might make your own home healthier, cleaner and happier.
The more efficiently a house uses energy (the less you use to stay just as comfortable), the less you pay the power company and the less non-renewable resources like oil or coal the power company needs to take from the earth.
It doesn't take a lot of effort to do this. Proper insulation, weather stripping and the right window glass can make a major impact on your pocket book with minimaleffort.
Insulation reduces the loss of heating or air conditioning so these appliances don't have to work as hard. Weather stripping also might be considered a type of insulation, especially around doorsand windows.
Check the seals in these areas. If you can feel a draft, the seal may be damaged or worn and should be replaced. Caulkingis one option. It eventually will peel as it ages and dries out, butit can be replaced with relative ease.
Window glass, especially the low-emission or the double-glazed variety, also can reduce heat loss. Or, to keep it simpler still, shop for some energy-saving film coverings, which also can work well if properly installed and maintained.
Conserving water -- especially in this area, where protection of the Chesapeake Bay is so crucial -- is something everyone should make an effort to do.
Even something as simple as turning a faucet off can save 20 gallons of water a day. Taking care of a leaky toilet can recover up to 200 gallons a day.
Use water sparingly when brushing your teeth, washing dishes or shaving. Install a water conservation shower head for showers, and shower instead of taking a bath.
Water the lawn by soaking the soil to a depth of four to six inches, and do it only when the weather is dry. Contain rain water or run-offfrom the roof by planting trees, shrubs and other ground cover.
Reduce the amount of hard surfaces around the home. Wood decks with space between the boards let rain drain into the ground. Also, diverting rain onto the grass helps reduce run-off into storm drains that feed into the bay.
Theaverage home is not the toxic nightmare that haunts the dreams of the most fervent environmentalists, but it does have its own modest share of hazardous waste. Just remember to keep your use equally modest.
Buy only what you need of such items as paint, pesticides and thinners -- don't stockpile them. If anything is left over, don't leave it lying around. Get Rid Of It.
Some household hazardous material actually can be flushed down the toilet, because this dilutes the material and carries it away from food preparation areas. But don't flush different chemicals at the same time, since this could cause a dangerous chemical reaction.
If you can't toss something out, give itaway. For example, leftover paint can be donated to church groups orother volunteer organizations. Pesticides can be given to garden clubs.
Many gas stations have posted signs designating them as collection points for the recycling of motor oil.
This is of particular importance, because one quart of oil can contaminate more water than 80 people can drink in their lives. But four quarts can be recycled into 2 1/2 quarts of usable machine oil. And when you buy a new car battery, ask if the dealer will accept old ones for reconditioning.
If you come across a container of something that you can't identify, or something that just doesn't look right, LEAVE it alone until you can get some professional advice on its disposal.
There is a 24-hour emergency number for dealing with hazardous substances, 974-3551. This number is local throughout the state of Maryland.
Other numbers for information on hazardous waste handling are 1-(800)-I-RECYCLE from the Maryland Environmental Service, and (301) 454-3742 for the University of Maryland Cooperative Extension Service.
The need for cleanliness is axiomatic, but you don't always need to blast your dirtinto oblivion with the latest chemical cleanser. There are certain items that, albeit more prosaic, will do the job just as well.
For example, baking soda, soap (liquid, powder, or bar form) washing soda, white vinegar and borax can replace or supplement what you might normally use. Not only that, they are safer to dispose of and frequently cheaper.
Security issues raised in wake of boy's slaying High-rise residents claim conditions have deteriorated since NOI left - tribunedigital-baltimoresun
Security issues raised in wake of boy's slaying High-rise residents claim conditions have deteriorated since NOI left
Angry over an 8-year-old boy's slaying in a public housing high-rise, relatives and neighbors yesterday demanded better security and urged parents to take better care of their children.
The strangulation over the weekend of Marvin Douglas Wise Jr. -- allegedly by a convicted child molester who was visiting the complex -- became a rallying point for more than 50 residents of Flag House Courts.
At a news conference yesterday, speakers complained that Wells Fargo security guards -- who replaced Nation of Islam Security Agency guards in December -- have allowed conditions to deteriorate by allowing outsiders in without showing identification.
"If we don't do something about this, Baltimore will continue to be the city that bleeds and not the city that reads," said Wennie Gibson, a relative of the victim who lives in South Carolina. "The fight is not over yet. No one will be able to come in here and do what they did to Marvin."
Dorothy Scott, Flag House Courts tenant council leader, warned residents to take a stand and threatened to fine them $10 for missing tenant meetings.
"What we need right now is a solution. What can we do to make this a safer place?" Ms. Scott said. "We have to take the upper hand."
Marvin's mother, Mary Williams, broke down at the news conference, able only to thank friends for attending before losing her composure and sobbing.
In an interview Monday, Ms. Williams, 27, said her son, a third-grader at City Springs Elementary School who was nicknamed "Bear" for his large size, had looked forward to playing basketball and was excited about getting his team uniform. Friday was his first, and last, practice.
Police said Marvin was killed after leaving his mother's 11th-floor apartment at 26 S. Exeter St. to visit a girl in the apartment where the suspect was staying. A security guard found Marvin's body early Sunday in the back room of a vacant, debris-strewn 12th-floor apartment.
Police quickly arrested Shawn Brown, 27, who had been released in June from a New York state prison after serving nine years for attempted murder and for child molestation. He was charged with first-degree murder and is being held without bail until his trial.
Court documents released yesterday say a witness saw Mr. Brown coming out of the 12th-floor apartment after hearing screams.
Housing Authority of Baltimore City police said yesterday that Mr. Brown had been visiting his sister and had correctly signed in with guards on several occasions for overnight stays. Residents said that Mr. Brown befriended children living there and that he took Marvin and other children to the Inner Harbor.
Zack Germroth, a Housing Authority spokesman, said that under rules that took effect in October, Mr. Brown might not have qualified for residency because of his criminal record. But he said it is impractical to run a background check on every visitor.
Housing officials also agreed to board up all 92 vacant apartments in the three Flag House Courts high-rises. Mr. Germroth said the apartment where Marvin was found slain had been sealed, but someone had pried off the boards.
A wake is scheduled for 11 a.m. Friday at St. Abraham Baptist Church, 1124 W. North Ave. Services will follow at 11:30 a.m.
As president of the National PTA, Joan Dykstra will be at the forefront of this week's celebration of the group's 100th anniversary. But the Ellicott City resident says she wishes she could share the spotlight with all of the organization's 6.7 million members.
"It's a very special time, not so much for the leadership, but for all of the people who are members of local PTAs and are involved in their neighborhood schools every day," Dykstra said. "Sure, it's nice to be in the leadership, but what has been really special is how this anniversary has been an opportunity for PTAs across the country to reflect on its importance."
Those local celebrations can be found in PTAs throughout Howard County, many of which have been serving birthday cakes at school meetings and decorating school display cases.
The national celebration includes a black-tie gala in Washington, D.C., tonight, which will be televised via satellite at PTA parties in Annapolis and every other state capital. The U.S. Postal Service plans to unveil a stamp in honor of the PTA tomorrow morning at the National Postal Museum, a ceremony at which the Howard Children's Chorus will sing.
For Dykstra, the anniversary comes about 20 months into her two-year term as national president, a period in which she has helped raise the PTA's profile and continued her fight for the welfare of children.
"Every step Joan has taken at the PTA, she has worked really hard to build it up at a grass-roots level and make it a strong voice in children's issues," said Linda Oaks, a member of the National PTA's board of directors who lives in Cedarburg, Wis. Oaks has known Dykstra since 1981, when they began working together on Wisconsin PTA issues.
"She has this contagious enthusiasm and a great ability to make volunteers want to challenge themselves," Oaks said.
Dykstra, 50, a native of Racine, Wis., moved to Ellicott City in 1989 because of her husband's job, bringing with her a history of PTA service that dates to 1973 -- the year her oldest child entered kindergarten.
In Wisconsin, Dykstra was elected the state's PTA president and the region's national vice president. The Wisconsin Jaycees called her one of the 10 Most Outstanding Wisconsinites.
Since coming to Maryland, she has served on the executive board of both Howard's and Maryland's PTAs and has been the national vice president for membership.
"We were very fortunate she moved to Howard County -- here was this tremendous resource for both the county and the state PTAs," said Rosemary Mortimer, president of Wilde Lake Middle School's PTA.
Mortimer was elected county PTA president the spring after Dykstra moved to Maryland and says she quickly persuaded the Wisconsin transplant to join her executive board.
The women discovered they both liked to walk -- but not alone -- and quickly struck up a habit of walking around Ellicott City's Centennial Lake, halfway between Dykstra's home in Mount Hebron and Mortimer's in Clemens Crossing.
Instead, Dykstra has found herself on the road at least three weeks a month, speaking to PTAs and other national groups -- as well as spending time in the group's Chicago headquarters.
During her term, she has been active on such issues as television ratings, teen-age smoking, the need to repair school buildings and classroom use of technology.
She declined to reveal which one -- not wanting to earn the wrath of that state's PTA -- but said her visit to Alaska this spring will be No. 49.
With the slogan "Working Together for Children" as the theme of her term, Dykstra said her hope is that she has encouraged more parents to become active in their children's lives.
"That's the No. 1 issue -- parental involvement," Dykstra said. "Parents have to become involved with their children, even in these chaotic times.
"If we've been able to encourage more parents to come out and find a way to get involved, then I think we've been successful."

Comedic stuntman and professional escape artist Brian Rudo recently removed celery from someone’s mouth with a bullwhip while telling jokes. That’s just one of the many diverse stunts that make up his Adrenaline Comedy Show, which he has performed at the Inner Harbor for over 13 years. Rudo, Randallstown-born and currently living in Reisterstown, gave b a fascinating glimpse into the personality of a man unafraid to … well … a man unafraid!
Biggest pet peeves? Chewing with your mouth open and lip smacking. That’s quite annoying. And people who are interested in watching a show but still stay as far away as possible.
Worst habit? Lack of memory, paying attention, remembering people’s names, and things of that nature. My wife yells at me quite frequently for that.
Last great meal you had? I don’t know … I don’t have an “oh my God I remember when I ate that!” If I had to pick a food … I like crab cakes.
Favorite sports? To watch on TV, MMA [Mixed Martial Arts]. To participate in, wrestling. Anything sports-related, I’d rather do that than read. I’m starting to train right now for an underwater escape. I did one 10 years ago, but this one’s more dangerous; it’s fully surroundable, no curtains. You’re not gonna miss anything.
What’s on your iPod? I own an iPod but I don’t use it personally. I prefer the radio – in Baltimore, 99.5, 104.3. If I’m exercising I pay attention to what’s around me. I couldn’t name a song, let alone sing the words.
What are your music tastes? I like everything ... Red Hot Chili Peppers, Usher. I try to be eclectic. I don’t have to try hard. I’m not a huge country fan. When you drive a lot, it’s pretty much all you can find.
Favorite saying? “Hard work pays off.” It’s the mantra for my wrestling team. I coach at Franklin High School in Reisterstown.
Last concert you attended? Probably Billy Joel and Elton John, a decade ago. I don’t like crowds — a very common trait among performers.
State lawmakers have placed more than 700 bills before Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign, reject or let pass into law unsigned by Sept. 30, and 28 of them come from lawmakers representing Glendale and Burbank.
The most prolific local lawmaker is Assemblyman Anthony Portantino (D - La Cañada Flintridge), who has 17 bills before the governor. State Sen. Carol Liu (D - Glendale) has seven under consideration. Assemblyman Mike Gatto (D - Silver Lake), —sworn in two months before the deadline for new legislation—has four.
Portantino's effort to launch a California cord blood bank, inspired by the case of a La Cañada Flintridge neighbor who beat leukemia with the help of donated umbilical cord blood, was revived after stalling in the Senate. It now awaits action by the governor.
Other Portantino bills would allow supermarkets and retailers to buy licenses to offer tastings of wine or alcohol; encourage teens to call in cases of alcohol abuse without risking arrest; make it easier for college students to seek available federal financial aid; require health insurers to cover mammograms for women of all ages; and offer insurance breaks to victims of the Station fire.
The Station fire bill gained momentum when Portantino worked with Republicans representing other regions struck by disaster in 2009.
"I try to work in a bipartisan manner with my colleagues," Portantino said. "I'm pleased I've been successful so far and am hopeful the governor will respect and respond to that effort."
Liu said she has cut back on the number of bills she introduced, recalling her days in the state Assembly that lawmakers once averaged as many as 20 bills each year.
"The last couple of years, because of budget considerations, we've made a conscious effort to not introduce a lot of measures," she said.
Her inspiration for legislation comes from her interest in education and her role as chair of the Senate Human Services Committee, she added.
Liu described spending a night in Valley State Prison for Women in Chowchilla several years ago, where she learned many were in prison for non-violent offenses, and many were mothers.
The Soviet Union plans to allow 280 Jewish families--about 1,000 people--to emigrate to Israel in April, a sharp increase from recent months, Israel radio reported. The broadcast quoted Yuri Stern, director of the Soviet Jewry Information Center, as saying that according to Moscow sources, the families have been told officially that they will receive emigration documents in a few days. Among them, he said, are several activists who have long been denied emigration.
I wish to thank Nichols for his letter. How often I've been meaning to write on this subject! To think that we are living in one of the most civilized (?) parts of the world, and yet so many drivers are callous and selfish about "beating the light."
What is just as annoying as the daring dasher one has to wait for before one can move on one's own green light, is the Red Runner who pretends that he or she was well across the white line when planning to make a left turn, and the light went red. Being trapped in the intersection or being partly in it is one thing; but how dangerous it is to move forward when that continuous stream of innocent-feeling drivers keeps coming out of nowhere?
It seems to me that we need a public-minded helping hand from the media on this. How about asking the radio and TV traffic announcers to add a brief message, warning of this constant hazard? Like, "Don't be a California Red Runner. It's the dumbest bird around.!"?
By all signs Egypt is not a country destined to enjoy a quiet future. The widespread rioting by security units this week is indicative of the threat to stability that President Hosni Mubarak's regime is likely to continue to confront. The immediate cause of the rampage is said to have been a rumor that conscripts in the miserably paid police forces would have their term of service extended. The more potent and enduring underlying cause is mounting frustration over the feeble and worsening state of Egypt's economy.
Gross inefficiencies, widespread corruption, bureaucratic bumbling and dubious allocations of resources all contribute to a chronic economic malaise. Add to that a birthrate that is one of the highest in the world and that each year puts further strains on social services that have never, by any reasonable measurement, been regarded as adequate. Add to that the insoluble natural constraints of the Nile that limit agricultural production to only 3% of the land.
Add, finally, problems more recent in origin. Falling oil prices and a commensurate cut in production have slashed foreign-exchange earnings. Remittances from the significant part of the Egyptian labor force that is employed in the Arab oil-producing countries have declined. Scores of thousands of these often highly skilled workers have had to come home to a country where jobs are scarce, compensation is poor and living conditions are at best difficult. At the same time fears of terrorism have cut deeply into the revenues from tourism that have always been a major source of national income. This week's attacks on hotels catering to Westerners seem certain to diminish the flow of tourists even more.
Meanwhile, Islamic fundamentalists, for decades a problem for successive regimes, see new chances to widen their appeal. Despising the West, the fundamentalists have grown more active in demanding the adoption of a strict Islamic legal code and the reshaping of society to rid it of the modern traits and influences that they consider to be the source of Egypt's problems. Where frustrations are high, where squalor will not go away, the promise of fundamentalism tends to be listened to. Egypt's present is unquestionably troubled. Its future is likely to be even more so.
Want to bank that $7.50 instead of spending it at the theater? In a growing number of cases, it seems, all you have to do is watch a movie's trailer--either the theatrical or the TV version--to be given a film's entire repertoire of sight gags or plot, twists and all, leaving many to wonder what's left to actually see the film for.
Trailers for "The Mask," "When a Man Loves a Woman," "Iron Will," "Forrest Gump," "Clear and Present Danger" and the upcoming "It's Pat" divulge nearly all plot elements or visual gimmicks, leaving those who actually pay to see the films disappointed to realize they've basically already seen them.
It's certainly not a new trend--trailers for "An Officer and a Gentleman," "Free Willy" and "Home Alone" all essentially gave away the endings--but as the number of releases has grown, competition has become much more fierce, and one of the main weapons in the marketing battle is the trailer. And studio marketing executives cheerfully admit that they sometimes pull out all the stops in making trailers.
Chris Pula, the New Line Cinema marketing president who masterminded the trailer for "The Mask," which showcases nearly all of the film's dazzling special effects (and who also masterminded the tell-all trailer for "Home Alone" when he was at Fox), decided to release the revealing trailer for several reasons--mostly to get as many people to the opening weekend as possible.
"When I started putting together this campaign, I was looking at 'The Mask' going up against 'The Flintstones,' 'True Lies,' 'The Lion King,' 'City Slickers II' and 'Beverly Hills Cop 3,' " recalls Pula. "Although (Jim) Carrey had a hit with 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,' he still wasn't a proven movie star. We knew this film was facing major competition and that we had to create a strong interest and wanna-see. Certainly in the heat of the summer, with a movie like 'The Mask' you have to pull out all the stops." That meant showing most of the special-effects gags in the film.
"Because a movie has to fight for its brand awareness or broad identity, sometimes you have to help the consumers out," adds Pula. "There's a lot of choices out there and they want to know what they're shelling out that $7.50 for."
And in the case of "The Mask," consumers arguably got their money's worth. The film has already grossed $70 million.
"I would say that 'The Mask' trailer is the best trailer of the year," says 20th Century Fox President Bill Mechanic, "and that's certainly not my movie. But the use of that trailer was a major tool in attracting an audience."
But for film purists, the trend comes at a cost. Los Angeles Times film critic Kenneth Turan and Time magazine critic Richard Schickel both say they receive a large volume of mail from moviegoers fed up with the studios' giving away too much of a movie's story, particularly the ending.
Take "Clear and Present Danger," for example. "The trailer has Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford's character) confronting the President, which is the climax of the movie," says Turan. "Now if you see the trailer before the movie, you don't know that that scene is the climax. But you certainly do afterwards. Sometimes the audience can feel cheated. But I think sometimes the studios are counting on people having short memories."
From the mail Turan and Schickel say they are getting, "the studios may be risking alienating their audiences," adds Turan. Schickel agrees.
A critic for 25 years, Schickel says he's "often lured by trailers. I can tell you in the case of 'The Mask,' I liked the trailer better than the movie! But really, if you give away the 10 best images, you may be giving away the premature deconstruction of the film.
"On the other hand, we're all a little bit childish about the movies. If the story's good, we don't mind seeing it and hearing it over and over again."
That's something that Disney is banking on, say its competitors. The studio has the reputation for being the biggest abuser of the tell-all trailers, especially with recent films like "Iron Will" and "When a Man Loves a Woman."
Richard Cook, president of Buena Vista Pictures Distribution, which releases Disney, Touchstone and Hollywood Pictures movies, begs to differ. "Clearly, if you have something that's unique, you want to tease. (But) with kid movies, you have to show them there is a story and identifiable characters. You want to make them excited and lure them into the theaters. You have to get the picture open."
And the objective of trailers, of course, is "to get butts into seats," says Universal Pictures senior vice president for marketing Bruce Feldman. "But there's a fine line between exploiting what you have and going to far. Around here, in all of our discussions, we generally resist giving away too much."
Simply put, he says, the element of surprise--one of the purest treats of going to the movies in the first place--should always win out.
Edward Daumer, former president of Northampton Borough Council, became a member of the Northampton Area School Board during a board workshop last night. Daumer was sworn in by board President Larry Kemmerer.
Daumer, a Democrat, fills the vacancy created by the resignation of Mrs. Linda Filipovits. He will serve until the next general election. Four people applied for the seat.
During a discussion about the $10-million renovation and expansion project for Northampton High School and the Lehigh School rejected in December by the board, district Superintendent Edwin Coyle said alternate proposals will be discussed during the regular board meeting next week. Dr. Coyle said the administration will not be prepared to make a recommendation on a proposal.
Rejection of the project by the board drew criticism from four district residents who spoke in favor of the project, which would have added classrooms and brought the buildings up to current code requirements.
Paul Szabo told the board that, had the project been approved, it would cost the average taxpayer 21 cents a day. He said he sees good things happening in the Lehigh Valley, and that the board should look at the positive things that are happening.
Board member Richard Anthony said he be- lieves something should be done to improve the buildings, but reaffirmed his position that he could not support a $10-million project.
Board member Donald Saul said the project would have required that the district pay back $18 million to borrow $10 million. Of the 40 cents the district would have received in reimbursembents from the state for every local dollar spent, Saul said, "That is not from some philanthropist in Harrisburg, that is from you and I. You and I will pay everything."
Jeff Rogers, former board member and a project supporter, spoke about the importance of quality of education and suggested a survey sponosred by the Parent-Teachers Association or a non-binding referendum. Rogers said there is "overwhelming support" for the project. Kemmerer said that, if a survey is sent home to parents, 20 percent of the district taxpayers will be involved because 20 percent of the tax bills go to people with children in school.
Bill Hickey, a resident, said he has received telephone calls at home about the project. He told the board there are "many concerned parents out there."
Senior high Principal Frank Kovacs told the board he will not recommend the opening of the Central Building for classes next year, but asked for permission to come back to the board if it becomes necessary to open the school. The building, at 15th and Main streets, previously had been used as a junior high school annex.
RESEARCHERS SAY an experimental drug has successfully alleviated some of the symptoms of amytorophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, although they caution it is not a cure. Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has stabilized deteriorating muscles in people with the deadly disease during clinical tests at the University of Wisconsin, says the Muscular Dystrophy Association, which funded the research.
THE LONG-EXPECTED veto of the omnibus trade bill is likely to come today even though the House will be in session and is likely to vote to override right away, White House and congressional officials predict. The battle over the veto will then shift to the Senate, where the president's forces are considered strong enough to sustain it. The Senate approved the bill April 27 by a vote of 63 to 36, three short of the 66 needed to override. The House vote on April 21 was 312 to 107, well over the two-thirds margin required.
She was born in Petoskey on March 26, 1934, the daughter of John and Anna Schwartzfisher. She graduated from Petoskey High School and attended the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where she met her husband, Vern Rietdorf. They were married in Ann Arbor in January 1955. They moved to El Sobrante, where they made their home. He preceded her in death in 1990.
She is survived by three sons, Mark and his wife, Beth, Kevin and his wife, Cindy, and Eric and his wife, Katie; and by two daughters, Kim (Frank) Muratore and Lisa (Ben) Carnahan; and by eight grandchildren. Also surviving are three brothers, John, Joseph and his wife, Louise, and Leo and his wife, Beverly, all of Petoskey; and seven sisters, Helen Schwartzfisher of Petoskey, Catherine Schwartzfisher of Petoskey, Agnes (Gerald) Wahl of Lansing, Teresa (Patrick) Biggs of South Bend, Ind., Jean (Don) Haase of Petoskey, Rose (Don) Novey of Saginaw, and Edith (Gordon) Kruskie of Petoskey.
Preceding Rita in death were her parents; her sister, Mary Mead; and brothers, Richard, Bernard and Alfred Schwartzfisher.
The funeral service will be 11 a.m. Wednesday, May 30, at St. Callistus Church in El Sobrante, Calif.
Lyn Leone of South Bend found out the hard way that when it comes to sending packages via the U.S. Postal Service, not any old box will do. "Here I was running around, and I grabbed the first box I could find," said Leone, a local attorney. "It was the perfect size, everything fit." She packed some gifts for friends in California -- newspaper clippings and a small statue of a moose in fishing gear -- and went to the post office branch at the University of Notre Dame. "I'm looking at (the box) simultaneously as the clerk, and I think, 'Oh my God, this isn't going to work.'æ" The side of the box read "charcoal lighter fluid." As far as the post office was concerned, it could have read "extremely flammable substance that is a definite no-no for shipping." Leone was certainly not the first customer to haul a package to the post office counter, only to have the box rejected. "It's a fairly substantial problem," said Dean McCool, spokesman for the U.S. Postal Service's South Bend office. "If the box lists anything that is considered a hazardous material by the Department of Transportation, we can't send it." Even if there isn't anything inside the box that matches the description on the outside, the service won't send the box. Some labels -- such as lighter fluid -- are obvious bad choices, said McCool. But boxes that contained any products designated as "ORM-D," which stands for Other Regulated Materials -- Class D, can't be used. These materials include perfume and laundry detergent that aren't in themselves considered dangerous, but are typically shipped in a large enough volume that they can only be transported by ground services, said McCool. Boxes that contained alcohol are also going to be rejected, he said. Other problems include containers with old address labels or postage. Using competitors' boxes -- such as FedEx and UPS -- is also not a good idea. "We don't encourage it," said McCool. "It's not that we don't like it, it's just that there is the potential for confusion." Containers previously used for priority mail delivery can only be used for the premium service, not parcel post, he said. The best advice to consumers is to use boxes with no markings and to check with the post office or other shippers with questions about the contents. Leone, who describes herself as very security-minded, was able to ship her box by borrowing a felt-tipped pen and some tape and obliterating the offending words. But that wasn't the end of the story. She listed only her initials and a post office box as the return address. Her friends weren't expecting a delivery. The suspect box was redelivered to Leone, who repacked everything and sent the gifts back out. The entire escapade took about two months. She still has the offending box. "In the frenzy of things, I did all the wrong things," she said. "And it came back to bite me." Staff writer Carol Elliott: celliott@sbtinfo.com (574) 235-6346

So my new color must have (and everyone else's this fall) is burgundy. I think its a good color for brunettes, and, as my sweet husband pointed out for me, it can double as game-day gear. I can look cute AND support our school without having to wear something that screams TEXAS A&M across the front of it. I picked up a burgundy top from Zara a few weeks ago that I'm obsessed with (it has rhinestoned shoulders - I LOVE shoulder detail!) AND scored a sweet burgundy dress from Forever21 for only $18. Can't wait to wear it to work once I get some new boots! (Hint, hint to my husband if he's reading - the Tory Burch ones I showed you would be a great Christmas present!) Here are some other burgundy looks that I'm eyeing for this fall:
Maybe Ash needs some burgundy that doesnt scream A&M - as she is certain she is going to A&M to be a vet - even cried about it the other night as she is certain her friends will go to UT - um you are 6 Ash - take it down a notch
Now I am wishing I had a burgundy coat instead of red! As I do also love red wine and that is what the color reminds me of today

[This remarkable passage, which I intend to discuss more fully in a future post, בג”ה, was first brought to my attention several years ago by a letter to the editor published in Hamodia , if I recall correctly.]
Now that these cheerful introductions have been made, we move on to the primary themes of this post: Halachah, ethics, decency, love, beauty, and constancy,
An issue that I find most fascinating is the intersection between Halachah, morality and decency. I recently encountered a classic example of this intersection in a brief responsum of Rav Yisrael Yehoshua Trunk of Kutna. He was asked about a woman who had contracted ‘the disease of the pox’ (probably smallpox) three months after her engagement, and as an effect of the disease, her face had become “wrinkled”, and she became “repulsive in the eyes of the fiancé, who does not wish to marry her”. The Rav of Kutna begins by ruling that as a matter of law, the man is perfectly entitled to break the engagement, without financial penalty, but he then insists that as a matter of “מוסר ויראה” this is wrong, and makes an eloquent and stirring plea to the man (and his parents) to not be faithless toward the completely innocent and blameless girl with whom he has entered into a covenant, and to not humiliate her by breaking the engagement. Notwithstanding the Talmudic dictum that אין אשה אלא ליופי, he reminds them of the even more ancient (and better known) Biblical admonition that שקר החן והבל היופי, and assures them that he will merit children who are “proper and fearful of sin” if his intention shall be לשם מצוה:
The Miggy Tree is a book that every mum would be delighted to receive and every child would be thrilled to read.
The Miggy Tree was written as a gift by Karl Yeomans for his mum, Margot, more affectionately known as Miggy, to celebrate her 50th birthday.
In 2006, when Karl was only 33, his life was tragically cut short by a malignant brain tumour. Shortly after his death his wife, Julie Buxton, decided to bring this wonderful poem to life as a beautifully illustrated book and a precious gift for their two year old son Marlow and his grandma, Miggy.
Karl’s eloquent and quirky prose is complemented by a set of exquisite illustrations by Anna Walker, whisking us away to the magical, whimsical world of The Miggy Tree.
Earl Brooks is a highly respected businessman and was recently named Portland's Man of the Year. He hides a terrible secret however: he is a serial killer known as the Thumbprint Killer. He has been attending AA meetings and has kept his addiction to killing under control for two years now but his alter ego, Marshall, has re-appeared and is pushing him to kill again. When he does kill a couple while they are making love, he is seen and photographed by someone who also has his own death and murder fetish. In a parallel story, the police detective investigating the murder is having problems of her own. She is going through a messy divorce and a violent criminal who had vowed revenge some years before has escaped from prison and is after her.

Here is my card using Just Some Lines' "Gab more pleasant" image. She is placed on a background of various scraps of decorative paper. They remind me of various fabrics in the house that she is preparing to clean. Gab looks like she is taking a break though from cleaning and thinking about more pleasant Spring-type things. She is colored with Copic markers. The sentiment is also by Just Some Lines.
I'm glad you have come by for a visit. You are welcome to join in any of the challenges by sharing some of your creative work.
On the white base I placed a piece of lavendar designer paper of roses. On top of that are two lacey circles by Spellbinders. These were stamped with two Our Daily Bread Design stamps. Next I placed a silver ornate trim from the fabric department at Wal-mart. As a final touch are two strips of purple ribbon, a bow and a corner adorner cut with a Cheery Lynn Designs die.
Very lovely card, Vicki. Good luck and thanks for joining in on the fun at Cheery Lynn Designs challenge blog.

As life is a journey, God is continually teaching me so many things. In order to be a good steward of these lessons, I write of them, hoping others might too benefit. "We live by faith, not by sight." 2 Cor 5:7
As I continue to consider moments, I realize the most wasted moments are those we sit too long in hurt and anger over being wronged. Until we forgive, really forgive, that person, what happened, owns us. It shapes us. That’s not what we want!
Unforgiveness steals our moments. New moments that God may have for us are lost because we’re unable to let go of the past. Our bitterness keeps us from enjoying today.
When we’re sinned against, disrespected, betrayed, it’s reasonable to feel hurt. It’s even ok to be angry. But there comes a time to move on, forgive. The more quickly we can do this, the better.
“Therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor, for we are all members of one body. ‘In your anger do not sin’: Do not let the sun go down while you are still angry, and do not give the devil a foothold.” Ephesians 4:25-27
“Make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy; without holiness no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many.” Hebrews 12:14-15
Forgiveness is not merely saying “I forgive you”. It’s a condition of the heart. Speaking the words may be required or even essential to heal ourselves or move forward in a relationship. But whether or not we are able or choose to speak it, we must do it, from the depths of our soul.
Forgiveness is a decision. I have to decide I want to forgive. However, the actual forgiveness may be a process. Some times a hurt is so deep, that we must “forgive” by decision over and over again, until the heart really lets it go. It could take days, months, even years. I’m free to mourn and heal (without this, the forgiveness might not “stick”) but it’s not ok to let a bitter root spring up; my forgiveness has to be active. I need to work through my hurt, until it is really resolved.
We have truly forgiven, when we can wish the other well and love again freely, keeping no record of rights or wrongs. It’s allowing the past to be the past and taking our lessons forward.
“Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.” 1 Corinthians 13:4-7
We some how believe unforgiveness punishes the wrong doer. However, the truth is, we remain enslaved until we forgive. Not to mention, it puts us into sin, erecting a wall between us and God.
1) God is not sovereign. He didn’t know this would happen. It was out of his control or occurred outside his jurisdiction.
2) God is not just. He didn’t handle the situation fairly, so we need to take matters into our own hands.
All of these are FALSE (the enemy's lies) and dangerous to believe. When we're hurt, we somehow feel that God has lost control, so we put up walls to protect ourselves in case it happens again. And we deny each other our human-ness, the right to be ever improving vessels it the potter's hands. We can’t live in the moment when we’re living like this.
Let’s remember what is TRUE: God is all powerful and all knowing. Nothing happens outside what he allows. He is just, but he is also full of grace. I’m thankful he doesn’t give me what I really deserve! He loves each of us dearly, as his children. And though we don’t always understand, he has a purpose for everything, even if it’s just to teach us.
This means that whatever has happened, even the bad, he’s allowed, through all his love for me. He must have a great purpose, far beyond what I can understand. We should look for any good that has come out of a situation, acknowledge that value, and forgive.
For two years God has been teaching me that I need to trust people. When I struggle to trust a person, I need to trust God more. I need to remember that nothing occurs outside of his grasp and everything he uses to fulfill his plans for me. An ever growing faith should lead to an ever growing capacity to forgive, as we acknowledge who God is and that he’s sovereign.
“And without faith it is impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him.” Hebrews 11:16
“Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy.” Micah 7:18
“Praise the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits- who forgives all your sins and heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit and crowns you with love and compassion, who satisfies your desires with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's.” Psalm 103:2-5
“For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his love for those who fear him; as far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.” Psalm 103:11-12
“Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.” Luke 6:37
“I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more.” Isaiah 43:25
If a perfect God can forgive an imperfect person, surely an imperfect person can forgive another imperfect person. We should find a way to do this, understanding and acknowledging through our own circumstance how prone we are to failure! How many times have I hurt another out of honest mistake or just pure stupidity? More than I can count. Few if any of us intentionally sin against one another. And for even those who do, or who may show no remorse, it’s not that they won’t serve the consequences for their actions. It’s just not our's to dole out, only God’s.
This verse, if you’re unawares, pertains to the woman caught in adultery. Jesus catches a group of men about to stone this woman for her sin. But he wisely points out, that’s not their right.
Some commentaries postulate that the older men were actually the first to put their rocks down. In their age, they were far more aware of the sins they’d committed over time. Likewise, the more religious knew how prone they too were to sin and could not hold it against her. As I age, and grow in faith, I too am aware of all my failings. I have to be ready to forgive others.
In the past month, there have been several people I’ve been called to forgive. In two situations, I was hurt by actions of friends, quite unintentionally. Because I love these friends, we talked it out and all is well. In another situation, I was hurt, but gave it to the Lord and just let in go. I was less invested and the infraction not as critical, so that was possible. But a final situation was for more troubling and has been more difficult.
Though details are unimportant, several years ago I was truly wronged. Someone said and did some things against me, publicly, that few of you would dispute as terrible. To this day, that person has zero remorse. I have reason to be angry.
Until recently, I hadn’t seen this person for years, so thought I’d forgotten about it. I may have forgotten, but my visceral reaction made it clear I hadn’t forgiven.
Terrible thoughts and feelings soared through my mind and heart. I was ashamed at how angry I was! I began to pray through it and time and time again, this one verse came up…
“You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.” Genesis 50:20
For those of you unfamiliar with the story of Joseph, Joseph’s brothers were jealous of him, so they sold him into slavery. They lied to their father and said he’d been killed. In spite of his own faith and righteousness, through a series of other twisted events, he ends up in prison. But then he interprets a dream for Pharaoh and is given a key position. This enables him to save his own brothers from famine, securing a future for Israel. He says this to them, forgiving them for what they did.
You see, God always knew what would happen. He allowed it. And he planned on how to use it. Neither Joseph’s brothers, nor any other, had power to harm Joseph beyond what God allowed.
Such is surely true in my situation. God knew it. He allowed it. He had a reason. I look back now and see how God used it for good in the lives of many. So how can I not forgive?
That’s when God gave me the words of this blog: Unforgiveness denies God his sovereignty and challenges his character. He’s proved himself true. Just because one intended to hurt me, didn’t mean God had lost control. The opposite!
“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.” Romans 8:28
I have some thoughts on forgiving God (yes, forgiving GOD) and forgiving ourselves, but this is enough to chew on for now. You’ll just have to wait for future blogs!
Father God, forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Lord, you know in our hearts, there are things that are easy to forgive and others that are far more difficult. Some times it is our pride that keeps us from forgiveness. Some times it is extensive, deep hurt. Help us to forgive. Help us to acknowledge your sovereignty. Help us to trust you, no matter how we've been wronged. Help us to heal and move forward. Show us the lessons you have for us and help us release any right or claim to retribution. Teach us to love those who its harder for us to love. AMEN.

Plot Marge brings an "Oprah's Puzzle Club" jigsaw puzzle to the Simpsons Family Wednesdays. When Grampa sees that the box says "Suitable for ages from 8 to 80", he leaves in a huff with Maggie. Milhouse shows up with a rock polisher, but Bart - along with the rest of the family - is becoming increasingly engrossed in their slow but steady progress with the jigsaw. Bart even takes some pieces with him to school in his lunch box. Lenny and Carl visit the Simpsons' home to inquire about Homer's absence from work for the last few days, wondering whether he has taken up another job...again! Homer, obsessed with the puzzle, imagines Lenny as being made of jigsaw and tries to add him to the puzzle, causing pain to his long suffering eye.<br /><br />Finally, the Simpsons finish the jigsaw puzzle. As they admire it, Ned Flanders points out that there is one piece missing. The family starts searching for the piece. Bart finds their old gerbil (who they thought had run away) under the sofa cushions and crosses himself solemnly. Homer searches his closet, saying "Puzzle piece, come out to play-ay..." (a reference to the 1979 film The Warriors). Instead, he finds a box labeled "Marge's Memory Chest," which contains a business card he made for Marge, an old T-shirt she wore to the Rolling Stones' "last concert ever" and an invitation to the opening of Moe's Tavern. Homer, on reading the writing on the back of the invitation, discovers that Marge was unhappy about sitting alone at Moe's while Homer played video games and drank himself silly. When Homer later got alcohol poisoning that day, she felt even more angry. In the present, Homer wonders why Marge stayed with him all this time and finds out that two days after his alcohol poisoning, she was pregnant. Marge enters the room after finding the missing jigsaw piece (found under Maggie's eyelid) and asks Homer why he looks unhappy. He confronts her with the note. She says that she was mad, and she loves him even if he does aggravate her. Angrily, he refuses to sleep in the same bed with her. He instead cries himself to sleep in Bart's bed.<br /><br />The next morning, Homer gets even madder with Marge, packs up, and moves into Bachelor Arms' Apartments with Milhouse's dad, Kirk. However, after listening to lonely men weep, Homer is ready to move back home - until he picks up a newspaper advertising an affordable room on the river. Homer unwittingly travels into Springfield's gay district. He encounters Waylon Smithers, roller-skating in a red tank top and bright blue shorts. When Smithers sees Homer, he feigns ignorance of the surrounding gay area, though a tramful of gay men greet him, much to his embarrassment. Homer meets his new gay roommates, Grady and Julio. The three become good friends while shopping, where Grady and Julio buy Homer a tight black T-shirt (and a girdle to prevent his huge belly from popping out). Later, when Homer visits Marge, their meeting is rather icy and the family notices Homer's newly-acquired mannerisms and the fact that his hands (which he uses to strangle Bart) are quite smooth, thanks to a new lotion. That night, at the local gay bar, Homer tells Grady and Julio that the chance for reconciliation is low. They invite him to dance and he does, taking off his shirt and playfully bouncing around, to the delight of the men, not so much the women.<br /><br />The next day, Homer hears a sound outside his new apartment. From the balcony, he sees Marge and the kids, who have brought "Weird Al" Yankovic and his band, who play a song called "Homer and Marge" (spoofing John Mellencamp's song "Jack and Diane"), to tell Homer that Marge loves him very much. Marge then asks Homer out on a date, to which he agrees. That night Homer is nervous while preparing for his date, so his roommates bring out a pitcher of margarita, which sounds like "Marge", which he takes as a sign to drink. Meanwhile, at the medieval-styled restaurant, Marge anxiously awaits Homer. Julio reminds Homer of his date and Homer runs to meet Marge. He shows up drunk. Marge, angry at his drunkenness, leaves. At the apartment, Grady tries to console Homer and slowly starts to come on to him. When he kisses Homer, Homer bolts out the window and runs to Moe's. There he wonders aloud whether he should give up drinking, considering that alcohol is to blame for all his relationship problems. Moe hears this epiphany and, unwilling to lose a regular customer, shoves a bottle of beer into Homer's mouth and forces him to drink "his medicine". Homer suffers alcohol poisoning and Moe wheels him to the hospital in a shopping cart. He leaves him there, nearly gets caught by the cops, but blames another bar for the poisoning.<br /><br />After Homer is cured, he tells Dr. Hibbert that Marge must hate him. However, Hibbert shows him a videotape (which he made because he thought that his nurse was stealing sponges) that documents Homer's first alcohol poisoning. It shows Marge's compassion for the unconscious Homer, as she tells him she loves him. Back in the present, Marge comes inside the hospital room and says that she still loves Homer and they kiss.<br /><br />Years later, a much older Hibbert is sitting in his den alone and feeling sorry for himself. All he has are videotapes of his patients. He is watching Homer and Marge kiss, when suddenly he sees that his nurse was, in fact, stealing his sponges.<br />

Q. I filled up at the gas station yesterday and put 15 gallons of gas in my tank. However, when I got to the station, my fuel gauge still was on 1/4 of a tank and my owner's manual says the tank only holds 16 gallons. How can this be? Or, I bought a new gas can the other day at the local hardware store. It's supposed to be a five gallon can but I got 5 ½ gallons in it. I think the pump must be off.
A. This is the complaint we get the most, and the short answer is that all tanks are not created equal. The stated capacity of your gas tank in your owner's manual or what's stamped on your gas can is often more of an approximation than a fact. A major manufacturer may buy fuel tanks from a variety of suppliers, all of which may hold either a little more or a little less than the stated capacity. Also, the volume of fuel contained in the filler tube will vary. In almost every instance when we retest the pump in question, it is found to be within tolerance (+/- 0.025 gal. for every 5 gal. dispensed). Even so, we will investigate all complaints filed with the Bureau.
Q. Why is the regular unleaded gasoline only 85.5 octane here in Montana while in other states the regular unleaded is 87 octane?
A. The antiknock or octane rating of a fuel is a measure of its resistance to knock. The antiknock requirements of an engine depend on numerous factors, including engine design, operation, and atmospheric conditions. Automobiles manufactured prior to 1984 could, due to Montana's altitude, operate on a fuel having a lower octane rating and achieve the same performance that other cars using 87 octane fuel had at sea level. Since the advent of sophisticated engine control technology starting in 1984, however, the effect of altitude upon octane rating has declined to the extent that the newest cars require the listed octane as found in the owner's manual regardless of the altitude.
While the minimum antiknock rating in Montana is 85.5 for regular unleaded fuel that is not necessarily what is found. Due primarily to competition and/or multiple suppliers of refined products, regular unleaded gasoline found in Western and Northeastern Montana usually has an octane rating of around 87.0. Central and Southern Montana's fuel octane rating is generally found to be between 85.5 and 86.0
A. Any type of deli item must be sold on a net weight basis. The weight of the container is called "tare" and is not included in the net weight. Almost all scales now in use at deli counters are of the digital computing type and show the weight of the product, the price per pound, and the total selling price on a digital display that faces the customer. Additionally, the customary practice in most stores is to assign a store code to each item. Information included in this code, which is stored in the scale, contains the name of the item, the price per pound, and the correct tare weight for the container which should be used. So when you want to purchase an item, the counter person will enter the store code for your item and the display panel will show the selling price and the weight display should show a negative number which represents the container or tare weight being zeroed off the scale. If you do not see this negative number displayed when the code is entered, you may be paying for the container and should report this to the Bureau.
Q. I'm thinking about going into business for myself and I'm going to be using some scales. Do I need to license them?
A. All devices, whether weighing or measuring, that are used to determine a price for any commodity that will be sold must be licensed. For more information on licensing please contact our office.
A. Companies who register with us can install or service a device and when they certify the device as accurate, the device is legal to use, as long as it is also licensed. Not all devices sold are legal to use in Montana, so a service company can also guide you to a correct purchase, or you can call the office to see whether a particular device is legal in this state. In addition, the registered service company has forms called "Placed in Service" forms, which they submit to us so that you do not need to contact us about your device being repaired or a new device being installed, and our inspectors will schedule the earliest opportunity to test when we receive that placed in service order.

Because I've been away from the book blogging world for a time, I can't remember specific books that I've read because of specific blogger recommendations, but I know there are SO MANY. I know I added several to my TBR shelf after reading all the intros on Monday, and the ginormous number of want-to-reads on Goodreads is thanks to reviews from blogs over the years. So I blame you all!!
An author that I push/strongly suggest/gush about too much is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. I urge friends to read her books and watch her talks. I've picked works by her for two book clubs now. My success in creating Adichie groupies has been marginally successful. When one book club met at my house to discuss Half of a Yellow Sun, a couple of guests pretended that they finished the book (they later confessed that they didn't want to hurt my feelings) and talked about how much they loved one character without realizing that he did something pretty horrible later on in the book. They felt a little awkward and we still joke about it. Just recently I hosted a book club with another group of ladies to discuss Purple Hibiscus, which I had already read and loved. Less people attended than usual, but I'm not sure if that was due to lack of interest or just busy schedules. But one person there loved Purple Hibiscus, and immediately read two of her other books, and she loaned me We Should All Be Feminists. That made my night! One Adichie fangirl born!
Other books that I get really excited about and want everyone to read are All the King's Men by Robert Penn Warren, Middlemarch by George Eliot, anything by Graham Greene, Wednesday Wars by Gary D. Schmidt, Far From the Madding Crowd by Thomas Hardy. Oh, I could go on and on but I think the prompt said just one so I should stop!
Giggling about the book club participant not finishing the book and loved a character NOT, hahahhahaha and that is why you are always honest during book club discussions. Great post
We're reading Americanah for our book club in June. And, I've got We Should All Be Feminists at the top of my TBR. Glad to know you recommend this author!
You could NEVER gush too much about Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (in my opinion). I think she's an incredible writer. Half of a Yellow Sun was absolutely devastating (Purple Hibiscus too!), and Americanah was stellar and funny and a surprise. I can't wait to see what she does next.
Love book group stories - I always tell the members of my club, you don't have to read the book, but know that we will be discussing then ending (it's a mystery club). Something similar happened at one of our meetings and it was pretty funny - although a bit embarrassing to the person who made the 'error'. :-)
Even though you've been gone from blogging the last few years, I still remember some of the books I've read that I first heard about from you. :)
I really want to read Far from the Madding Crowd but I'm not sure I can agree with All the King's Men! I wanted to finish that book so badly but it was such a struggle for me to get through.
I read Half of a Yellow Sun thanks to book bloggers (I won it in a giveaway years ago...maybe from Caribousmom?) and loved it--I've been meaning to read more by her!
I just read We Should All Be Feminists last week and loved it! Sadly I have never read her before... oops!
Every minute there are 277k tweets, 4,320 minutes of video are being uploaded to YouTube and more than 2.5 million Facebook posts are being shared. That’s a lot of content which only makes the competition for the user’s attention almost impossible.
Many marketers also use link shorteners when applying UTM tags to campaigns – remember to never send a UTM link without shortening it – it’s a sure way to drive off traffic.
Most online analytics tools (such as Google Analytics or Tableau) are only available for traffic that lands on your own site. So how can you monitor clicks to other sites? That’s right – you shorten them. All of the url shortening services offer some information regarding the people who clicked on your specific link, usually stats such as number of clicks, geographic information, operating systems etc.
This is an extremely important tool to get to know your audience! For example, if you are Facebook admin and would like to better understand the engagement of different segments of your followers. All you need to do is just shorten the links and see if the users who are engaging are really from the countries you intended to target and how they’re consuming your content – through mobile, desktop or maybe only tablets? Know your audience so you could always stay relevant.
Continue to so the same work and make money from it. When sending traffic through a shortened link you can earn money by presenting an ad or promoted content in the middle. This kind of ads, called interstitial, is a full page ad with any content you wish to fill it with. Clk.im shortener offers within the free package the ability to shorten a link and enjoy by earning money from an automated ad platform. The idea is to earn money on the traffic your website/blog/YouTube channel generates.
The premium account offer users the ability to control the content within the interstitial meaning that you can simply promote any service or product you want.
Clkim is proud to introduce a Deluxe Starter package. This package is perfect for anyone who wants to increase their overall ROI...

A while back I posted about AutoHotkey not being able to interact with Windows 8 windows and other applications that were Ran As Admin. My solution was to run your AutoHotkey (AHK) script as admin as well, and I also showed how to have your AHK script start automatically with Windows, but not as an admin. Afterwards I followed that up with a post about how to get your AHK script to run as admin on startup, so life was much better, but still not perfect.
#1 is only a problem if you haven’t set your AHK script to run as admin on startup as I showed in my other blog post (i.e. you are still manually launching your script) or you haven’t changed your UAC settings to never prompt you with notifications (which some companies restrict) (see screenshot to the right).
#2 was a problem for me. I use AHK Command Picker every day. A lot. I’m a developer and in order for Visual Studio to interact with IIS it requires admin privileges, which meant that if I wanted to be able to use AHK Command Picker in Visual Studio, I had to run it as admin as well. The problem for me was that I use AHK Command Picker to launch almost all of my applications, which meant that most of my apps were now also running as an administrator. For the most part this was fine, but there were a couple programs that gave me problems running as admin. E.g. With PowerShell ISE when I double clicked on a PowerShell file to edit it, instead of opening in the current (admin) ISE instance, it would open a new ISE instance.
Today I stumbled across this post on the AHK community forums. Lexikos has provided an AHK script that will digitally sign the AutoHotkey executable, allowing it to interact with applications running as admin, even when your AHK script isn’t.
On the Select Source File prompt choose the C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe file. This was already selected by default for me. (Might be Program Files (x86) if you have 32-bit AHK installed on 64-bit Windows)
On the Select Destination File prompt choose the same C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe file again. Again, this was already selected by default for me.
That’s it. (Re)Start your AHK scripts and they should now be able to interact with Windows 8 windows and applications running as admin 🙂
This is a great solution if you want your AHK script to interact with admin windows, but don’t want to run your script as an admin.
If you do want to launch an application as admin, but don’t want to run your AHK script as admin, you can use the RunAs command.
Myself and a few co-workers have updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and have run into some weird problems. After a bit of Googling I have found that we are not alone. This is just a quick list of some things the the Windows 8.1 Update seems to have broken. I’ll update this post as I find more issues.
I found that some of the links in the website our office uploads our Escrow deposits to no longer worked in IE 11 (which 8.1 installs). Turning on the developer tools showed that it was throwing a Javascript error about an undefined function. Everything works fine in IE 10 though and no undefined errors are thrown.
I have also noticed that after doing a search on Google and clicking one of the links, in order to get back to the Google results page you have to click the Back button twice; the first Back-click just takes you to a blank page (when you click the Google link it directs you to an empty page, which then forwards you to the correct page).
Others have complained that they are experiencing problems with GMail and Silverlight after the 8.1 update.
So it may just be that IE 11 updated it’s standards to be more compliant and now many websites don’t meet the new requirements (I’m not sure); but either way, you may find that some of your favorite websites no longer work properly with IE 11, and you’ll have to wait for IE 11 or the website to make an update.
We use the SonicWall VPN client at my office, and I found that it no longer worked after updating to Windows 8.1. The solution was a simple uninstall, reinstall, but still, it’s just one more issue to add to the list.
Have you noticed other things broken after doing the Windows 8.1 update? Share them in the comments below!
In my personal opinion, I would wait a while longer before updating to Windows 8.1; give Microsoft more time to fix some of these issues. Many of the new features in Windows 8.1 aren’t even noticeable yet, as many apps don’t yet take advantage of them. Also, while MS did put a Start button back in, it’s not nearly as powerful as the Windows 7 Start button, so if that’s your reason for upgrading to 8.1 just go get Classic Shell instead.
If you are like me and don’t want to have to enter your password each time Windows loads, you can have Windows start up without prompting you to enter a user name or password. The simple (and BAD) way to do this is to simply not have a password on your user account, but that’s a big security risk and will allow people to easily remote desktop into your computer.
So, first set a password on your windows account if you don’t already have one. Then select Run… from the start menu (or use Windows Key + R to open the Run window) and type control userpasswords2, which will open the user accounts application.
On the Users tab, clear the box for Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer, and click on OK. An Automatically Log On dialog box will appear; enter the user name and password for the account you want to use to automatically log into Windows. That’s it.
You may also want to make sure your screen saver is not set to prompt you for a password when it exits either.
A word of caution about this: ANYBODY will be able to get into your computer. This is probably fine for your home desktop PCs, but you may want to think about enabling this on your laptop, especially if you regularly take it out and about and it has sensitive information on it (ID, credit card info, saved usernames/passwords in your web browser). If you weren’t using a password before anyways though, using this trick is still more secure than without it

Ward 1, Ward 5 voters send incumbents Kailasapathy and Warpehoski unopposed to November elections; Westphal, Grand and Krapohl also to be unopposed in Ward 2, Ward 3 and Ward 4
The results of city council Democratic primary elections held in the city of Ann Arbor on Aug. 5 can fairly be considered determinative of Nov. 4 election outcomes – because no Republicans or independents filed petitions to qualify for the ballot.
City council races were actively contested in only three of Ann Arbor’s five wards in the Democratic primary: Ward 1 (orange), Ward 2 (green) and Ward 3 (teal).
November will see at least three newcomers to the 11-member council – Kirk Westphal in Ward 2, Julie Grand in Ward 3, and Graydon Krapohl in Ward 4. Westphal and Grand won their respective Democratic primaries that featured no incumbents. Both candidates were coming off unsuccessful council campaigns last year – against Jane Lumm (Ward 2) and Stephen Kunselman (Ward 3), respectively.
Westphal received 1,819 votes (59%) to Nancy Kaplan’s 1,261 (41%) in a race that was anticipated to be somewhat closer. Grand received 1,516 votes (51.1%) compared to Bob Dascola’s 794 (26.8%) and Samuel McMullen’s 616 (20.8%). That gave a decisive result to a Ward 3 race that had been fraught with legal disputes – about Dascola’s eligibility to appear on the ballot in the first place; and then about how to count misprinted absentee ballots, which omitted Dascola’s name.
Krapohl’s race did not even appear on the Aug. 5 ballot – because he was unopposed in the Democratic primary and no Republican qualified for the ballot. The omission of the race from the ballot under those conditions is stipulated in a clause of the city charter.
Krapohl will be filling the seat to which Democrat Margie Teall did not seek re-election. Westphal will almost certainly be filling the Ward 2 seat that Sally Petersen left to pursue an unsuccessful mayoral campaign. And Grand will almost certainly be elected to fill the seat vacated by Christopher Taylor, who ran a successful campaign for mayor.
Taylor, who’s currently a councilmember representing Ward 3, will be the Democratic nominee in the Nov. 4 general election against independent Bryan Kelly. Assuming Taylor does prevail, he will remain on the council as mayor. And among the 10 councilmembers who represent one of the five wards, he’ll almost certainly see a total of seven returning faces, including the two incumbents who prevailed in the Aug. 5 primaries.
That’s because those two incumbents, like the new Democratic council nominees, will also be unopposed on the November ballot. First-term Ward 1 councilmember Sumi Kailasapathy prevailed over Don Adams, who was seeking elected office for the first time. Kailasapathy received 1,113 votes (56.8%) compared to 840 (42.8%) for Adams.
And first-term Ward 5 councilmember Chuck Warpehoski prevailed over Leon Bryson, who had announced he was withdrawing from the race after the deadline to remove his name from the ballot. Bryson still collected 674 votes (18.6%), but Warpehoski’s total was 2,936 (81%).
Those three newcomers and two incumbents will join the five councilmembers who are currently in the middle of their two-year terms: Jane Lumm (Ward 2), Jack Eaton (Ward 4) and Mike Anglin (Ward 5) – as well as Sabra Briere (Ward 1) and Stephen Kunselman (Ward 3), who were unsuccessful in their mayoral bids.
Below are some maps illustrating the geographic distribution of votes in the three actively contested city council races, as well as some limited analysis of the Ward 2 race in terms of questions that were part of a pre-election poll conducted by Public Policy Polling.
In the Aug. 5, 2014 Democratic primary, first-term Ward 1 councilmember Sumi Kailasapathy prevailed over Don Adams, who was seeking elected office for the first time.
Maps are shaded by precinct based on the percentage of votes received by each candidate. Kailasapathy’s percentages are shown in red; Adams’ percentages are shown in blue.
Kailasapathy received 1,113 votes (56.8%) compared to 840 (42.8%) for Adams. That’s a similar percentage breakdown to the 2012 Democratic primary race that Kailasapathy won against Eric Sturgis. In the 2012 race, Kailasapathy received 863 votes (58%) compared to 628 (42%) for Sturgis.
Kailasapathy lost one precinct to Adams – Precinct 1-10. The tally there was 273 for Adams compared to 211 for Kailasapathy. That precinct includes Arrowwood Hills Cooperative Housing, where Adams lives.
When The Chronicle dropped by the Precinct 1-10 polling station on its Election Day tour of the polls, Adams indicated he’d be spending the whole day at that precinct, saying “This is my family.”
In the color-shaded maps that are included in this article, Precinct 1-10 stands out in the central northern part of the ward.
In 2012, Kailasapathy was not as strong in Precinct 1-10 as she was in other parts of Ward 1, but still prevailed there against Sturgis. That year she lost a different precinct to Sturgis – Precinct 1-5, just to the south of Precinct 1-10 – by a tally of 123 to 157. That precinct was the home precinct of Sturgis. This year she prevailed there against Adams – by a tally of 177 to 136. Sturgis worked for Kailasapathy’s campaign this year.
In the Ward 2 city council race, Kirk Westphal received 1,819 votes (59%) to Nancy Kaplan’s 1,261 (41%) in a primary that was anticipated to be somewhat closer.
Westphal currently serves on the city planning commission, with a term ending in July 2015. In November each year, the city council makes an annual appointment from its own members to the planning commission – a position currently held by Sabra Briere (Ward 1). Regardless of how the council handles that appointment this year, an additional appointment will need to be made to the planning commission from the citizenry at large – to fill the spot that Westphal will be giving up to serve on the council.
Ward 2 precincts color-shaded according to percentage of the vote received: Westphal (blue) and Kaplan (red).
Westphal’s decisive margin in the Aug. 5 primary – of nearly 3 to 2 – saw Kaplan receiving about the same percentage of the vote as Westphal did last year in the 2013 November election in Ward 2 – a race in which Jane Lumm prevailed.
One of the two precincts Westphal won that year was percentage-wise especially strong for him this year against Kaplan – Precinct 2-1 in the middle of the ward. In 2-1, Westphal received 73% of the vote this year. But it was comparatively lightly voted – with the actual tally just 77 to 28 votes. The neighboring Precinct 2-8, just to the west of 2-1, was also nearly as strong for Westphal percentage-wise at 68%, but offered a much greater plurality. The tally was 289 to 136.
Kaplan did not win any precincts. The sparsely voted 2-2 was split three votes apiece for both candidates. Kaplan’s home base of support in the southern part of the ward near Huron Hills golf course delivered the closest meaningful total for Kaplan – at 48%. Kaplan had campaigned in part on her participation in an effort a few years ago to defend Huron Hills golf course from a future that’s different from its status as a public park.
Westphal had campaigned in part by contrasting himself with Kaplan with respect to three points: (1) attitude toward downtown development (as a planning commissioner, Westphal voted to recommend 413 E. Huron for approval); (2) public transportation (Westphal supported the recent AAATA millage, which was approved by voters in on May 6); and (3) development of rail-based transportation options (Westphal supports investment in a new rail station).
Two of those issues were touched on in a pre-election poll of Ann Arbor voters, which was conducted by Public Policy Polling (PPP). Voters were asked their opinions about recent downtown development and their perceptions of a need for a new train station.
In general, do you support or oppose the increased development being approved and built downtown in recent years?
Do you think Ann Arbor should build a new train station/transit center, or do you think the current train station is adequate?
Base on those poll results, Westphal’s general position on those topics seems to resonate with more Ann Arbor voters citywide than not. A slim majority of Ann Arbor residents think Ann Arbor needs a better train station: The need for a new train station polled at 52%, while the alternate view – that the current station is adequate – polled at 35%. The poll indicated 46% support for the downtown projects that have been approved and built in recent years, and with opposition at 39%.
The poll had 435 respondents citywide, which means that the numbers for each of the individual five wards were fairly small. So conclusions about each ward’s cut of the data would need to be viewed with even more caution than the poll’s overall results.
But the breakout by ward on those two pre-election poll questions showed a great deal more ambiguity amongst Ward 2 voters than among voters citywide. Contentment with the current train station polled two points better in Ward 2 than a perceived need to build a better one – 44% to 42%. And support for recent downtown developments showed a split of 43% to 42%. Westphal’s ultimately successful campaign strategy did not appear to try to straddle the fence on those issues. Those results are presented in Charts 1 and 2 below.

Also part of the Ward 2 campaign was an explicit association of Westphal with mayoral candidate Christopher Taylor by the Michigan Talent Agenda’s set of endorsements. Westphal and Taylor also shared several donors to their campaigns. To the extent that voters perceived Westphal as similar to Taylor, that may have worked to Westphal’s benefit – because according to the PPP poll, voters have a favorable opinion of Taylor – not just citywide, but also in Ward 2.
Poll respondents were asked a different question about current mayor John Hieftje – related to job performance, as opposed to a favorable or unfavorable opinion of the person. But on that question Hieftje’s approval showed a different pattern from Taylor’s. Both men polled positively citywide, but more Ward 2 voters disapprove of Hieftje’s job performance than approve of it. There’s been a smattering of commentary over the last few years attempting to associate Westphal with Hieftje – based on the fact that it was Hieftje who nominated Westphal to the planning commission. Based on the outcome of the primary, that appears to be an association that is not felt strongly enough by voters to make a difference.

In the three-way Ward 3 race, Julie Grand received 1,516 votes (51.1%) compared to Bob Dascola’s 794 (26.8%), and Samuel McMullen’s 616 (20.8%).
That gave a decisive result to a Ward 3 race that had been fraught with legal disputes – about Dascola’s eligibility to appear on the ballot in the first place; and then about how to count some misprinted absentee ballots, which omitted Dascola’s name.
Concern about how to count those ballots – if a voter did not send in a replacement ballot – had been heightened by the fact that Ward 3 has historically featured close races. The 2009 primary race was decided by just six votes, which triggered a recount.
That outcome was based in part on Grand’s strength in the two precincts nearest to the center of the city near the Burns Park area – 3-3 and 3-4. Grand’s support in those precincts approached 60%. Grand also won Precinct 3-3 in her race against Kunselman last year, which she narrowly lost overall.
Like last year, Grand was not quite as strong in the mid-outer precincts of 3-8, 3-7 and 3-6, but still had more votes than Dascola and McMullen in every precinct in the ward.
The pattern of Grand’s support in the ward was similar but not identical to that of mayoral candidate Christopher Taylor’s in Ward 3 – his home ward. Precinct 3-6 was the only precinct won by Stephen Kunselman in the mayoral race (his home precinct). Grand still polled 41% there, after losing the Democratic primary to Kunselman last year. Grand had publicly endorsed Taylor in his mayoral race.
Precinct 3-6 was also one of the strongest precinct for Bob Dascola – among those precincts with a significant turnout. Dascola had publicly endorsed Kunselman in his mayoral race.
In the 2013 primary, Grand had also won Precinct 3-5 in the south of the ward. And that precinct was one of her stronger precincts again this year. Grand received nearly 58% of the vote in that precinct.
McMullen’s strongest precinct was 3-7, where he received nearly 28% of the vote. That’s the home neighborhood of Jeannine Palms, a long-time parks and environmental activist who had publicly endorsed McMullen and campaigned on his behalf.

The following terms describe the content of this article. Click on a term to see all articles described with that term: 2014 Democratic primary, 2014 election, Ann Arbor City Council, Bob Dascola, Don Adams, Julie Grand, Kirk Westphal, Nancy Kaplan, Samuel McMullen, Sumi Kailasapathy, Ward 1, Ward 2, Ward 3
If you assume (perhaps incorrectly) based on endorsements that Taylor / Warpehoski / Grand / Krapohl / Westphal make up one faction and Lumm / Anglin / Kunselman / Eaton / Kailasapathy make up the other faction, with Briere being independent, there’s two interesting results that emerge.
1) No ward leans towards one faction or the other. Essentially each faction is drawn from all wards and the same set of voters.
2) Given the overlapping term structure of council and the significantly skewed distribution of factions to either odd-year terms or even-year terms, with the exception of Kailasapathy, essentially the incumbents of each faction will be up for election every other year.
So, If the voters return incumbents to office every year going forward (a fairly common voting pattern), it might effectively look like the city can’t decide which faction to back and alternates from year to year. This could have a significant effect on perceived mandates for change (with each faction having a 1-year honeymoon before the other faction is reelected.) If however, one faction has sustainably captured the majority’s opinion, you could have a dramatic shift across a 2-election cycle.

Today I am going to show you how to pair eyeshadows together to create tons of looks. For many of us, it can be confusing when we are looking at a palette of colors to try and figure out which ones work best together and which ones won’t. This tutorial will help you to learn which colors, finishes and combination work best together and hopefull help aid you in picking which shades to choose from.
Always include a neutral – Using a neutral eyeshadow along any brighter shades you may use will keep the look more wearable and tone down the overall look.
Always mix your finishes – Eyeshadows come in finishes, shimmer and matte. Using all shimmer on your eyes will make you look like a disco ball while using just matte finish eyeshadows will look to flat. Using a combination of both with give depth and detail to the look.
Use a light, medium and dark color – A mixture of these three, regardless of the color scheme, will give you a well rounded look with a lot of dimension.
Now we can move on to blending shades. You always need to have a couple of shades that can be used for blending that are close to your skin color. One a matte finish and one with a shimmer finish. The matte one you will use under the browbone to blend out any harsh lines, the shimmer will be used to highlight under the browbone or in the inner corner to open the eye and make it appear lighter.
Below is a guide that gives you different kinds of color combinations that you all can put together. There are two ways of doing this Monochromatic Looks and Polychromatic Looks.
This look incorporates a light, medium and dark pink. The dark goes on the outer part of the eye, the medium pink on the middle of the eye and the light pink goes in the inner portion of the eye. Blend together this gives you an overall pink look.
This is a traditional dark brown smokey eye. This is where you take a dark brown and place it on the lid, a medium brown in the crease, and a light brown or tan color right above the crease to blend the colors out.

Shir HEVER: "BDS finds weak point in Israel’s politics of fear"(Middle East Eye, June 9, 2015!): click here!
Government efforts to fight ‘Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions’ are bolstering the movement and creating the political debate the campaign seeks to achieve.
There were some remarkable admissions in a piece by the distinguished Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling in the immediate wake of the British teaching union NATFHE’s vote this week to offer members moral backing if they boycott Israeli universities. British academics opposed to Israeli colleagues’ complicity in the lengthy and continuing occupation of the Palestinians are now advised to boycott them and their institutions.

The groups on the government’s blacklist are obsessed with Israel, but between the lines they are saying the boycott movement is going nowhere.

The three subjects that relapsed were given a second shot of the new treatment which cleared up the tumors again.
To eliminate the tumors, researchers used an immunotherapy approach by activating T cells in cancerous tumors. Researchers said they saw similar results in mice that had breast, colon, and melanoma tumors. One of the two agents that make up the vaccine is now approved for use in humans, according to researchers.
The new treatment, which was directly injected into the tumor sites of 90 mice, cured 87 mice of the disease.
It's also unlikely to cause adverse side effects often seen with other immune stimulation, according to researchers. In some cancer therapies that already exist, like T-cell treatment used to combat leukemia and lymphoma, the patient's immune cells need to be removed from the body and then are genetically altered to fight the cancerous cells before being reintroduced to a person's system.
Regardless of his future, McDaniels said Sunday's loss was one of the worst he's ever been through. "There's no doubt about that". The Patriots have rarely let people with significant institutional knowledge walk out the door since Belichick took over in 2000.
Researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine injected a cancer vaccine in 90 mice, and majority were cured.
Also, the approach works for many different types of cancers, including those that arise spontaneously.
Scientists injected two immune boosters - one a short stretch of DNA, the other an antibody - into tumors they'd implanted in the mice.
"When we use these two agents together, we see the elimination of tumors all over the body", said Levy. Compared to standard treatments which try to stimulate the entire body's immune system at once and raises costs, the Stanford vaccine only delivers a small amount of medication to a specific tumor area.
Residents described the sound of several explosions at the complex on social media, but police have not addressed those reports. In Michigan , 25-year-old Detroit Police Officer Glenn Doss Jr. was shot responding to a domestic violence call January 24.
What's even more encouraging is researchers believe that the local application of very small amounts of the agents could serve as both a rapid-and relatively inexpensive-cancer therapy.
The study, conducted by Stanford University School of Medicine, also found that the new treatment also eliminated untreated metastases, which are abnormal growths further away from the original tumor site.
Israel had been looking for the final member of the cell which it said killed Rabbi Raziel Shevah in a drive-by shooting. His declaration overturned decades of USA policy that its status should be decided in Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.
Abstract: The heavy metal, cadmium is a toxic compound for all living organisms, and requires, therefore, special attention in risk assessment studies. As cadmium is a rather mobile ionic species under acidic soil conditions, which are dominant in Thailand’s agricultural lowland, one could expect it to be present in agricultural crops. Consequently, it poses the potential risk of entering human food products. Research conducted over the last decades has found that rice, which is the main staple food item, is the main contributor to the human intake of cadmium in Asian countries. The objective of this study is to assess the change in risk when using treated biodegradable waste products as a substitute for chemical fertilisers in agriculture. Chemical analyses showed that the highest flow of cadmium in organic waste is in municipal wastewater sludge and biodegradable kitchen waste, whereas human excreta only carries small amounts of cadmium. Thailand does not presently have any regulation on this potential risk element, consequently international standards may be used for comparison. Recycling urban waste to agricultural land would, potentially, not exceed the American and European Union’s threshold limit for waste application to agricultural soils. However, a few European countries (e.g. Denmark) have stricter threshold limits, due to specifically vulnerable soil and groundwater conditions (alkaline clay soils with the ability to accumulate heavy metals), and these would potentially be exceeded if some of the urban Thai wastes were applied to the soils. It is concluded that the recycling of urban waste to Thai agriculture poses only a very small potential risk of cadmium contaminated food products.
All this is also reminiscent of this remarkable biographical tidbit about Rabbeinu Tam, recorded for posterity in the name of Maharil:
I'm trying to write an adventure (or actually, several) for a new tabletop RPG campaign that's going to start in a couple of months, and I am struggling.
My issues stem, I think, from how different the new system, 13th Age, is from the game I finished running last week, Monster of the Week. Where MotW is extremely light and relies heavily on improv, 13th Age is much closer to D&D's school of thought, with much more stuff to track moment-to-moment, especially once combat starts. The notes required for an entire arc in MotW feel like they'd barely be sufficient to cover a single scene in 13th Age.
While it should be easy enough to adapt the approach that worked for Monster of the Week into any other roleplaying system, in practice I'm finding it hard not to take things in a rules-heavy direction, with pages and pages of stuff written up.
Monster of the Week's missions - called "mysteries" - are largely self-contained and driven entirely by the players' investigations. The most amount of planning in a mystery is writing the six-point "countdown" of events that would happen without the players' involvement. Each location and character only needs a name and a role to indicate their involvement. I added a personality trait and "what this person knows" to my bystanders - a couple of lines, total, and almost no prepared dialogue.
Compare that to the eleven pages of stuff I've written for the first adventure in 13th Age - and that's not even all of it finished yet! I've got sketches of scenes and characters and places that would be more than enough to run with in Monster of the Week that I feel compelled to flesh out for this game. Monster of the Week's contemporary setting helps, as there's often a common real-world or pop culture reference for what a trailer park or a military base or someone's living room looks like, but a fantasy game demands (it seems) a level of ornate and detailed description that quite frankly I'm not sure my writing skills are up to.
Of course, it could just be a matter of the tools I'm using. Monster of the Week's lightweight setup lent itself perfectly to Trello boards, with columns to group cards for locations, bystanders and the monsters - but there's a separation between roleplay and combat in any initiative-driven that makes it too complex for Trello. Google Docs has been okay for making notes and blocking out the rough timeline for an adventure, but its layout encourages linearity, and I'm concerned it'll be difficult to jump between sections in the heat of a fight.

Recently I had the privilege of speaking at the Key Media HR Summits in Singapore and Hong Kong. In Singapore I followed Jodi Krause, The Director for Organization Effectiveness for Cisco, who spoke on Engaging Talent for Greater Productivity. As my talk immediately followed Jodi’s, with no break for the audience, I was in the wings for her presentation which I thoroughly enjoyed. In fact it was uncanny how many times Jodi proved with real evidence what I was about to talk about and so of course in my own presentation I referred to what Jodi had said several times.
Later on Jodi and I had a fascinating chat about Cisco and their geniune CSR practices and we have since corresponded with one another.
Here is link to a video by Cisco CEO John Chambers and other Cisco leaders about their CSR practices and philosophies, 5 mins of great insight and some other great information via the link.

If we see man as he is, he can only get worse. If we see man as he could be, he can only get better.
The lack of accountability across the board in the world today is the biggest reason in my view for our troubles as a human race.
Accountability is the other side of the coin to appreciation. And one without the other is a recipe for poor performance.
My ebook contains the best 45 tools, tips, and techniques I have designed and helped people to implement in the past 20 years that mean a better attitude towards people, greater appreciation of people, and higher levels of accountability. All these of course lead to greater performance and higher profits.
The debate about Facebook's apparent lack of respect for our privacy is still raging. I am still considering whether to stay with Facebook or not!
My decision however probably won't be influenced all that much by what Facebook does or doesn't do about privacy.
I find LinkedIn a far superior place because for me there is an absence of fluff on LinkedIn whereas Facebook for me contains all kinds of useless stuff that I mostly find annoying and an unnecessary interruption to my life.
There are other alternatives to Facebook of course such as Trustworks, or Hyves. I am not a member of either of these however I do stay up with who is doing what and where.
For me my question is: What is the value for me of staying on Facebook? And right now I can't see a lot of value. It is not a tribe for me like differencemakers, or egurusbiz, or the groups of I am involved in on LinkedIn.
David Cameron and Nick Clegg’s rise to Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of United Kingdom has got me thinking of life beyond party politics. Neither man’s party won enough votes in the recent election so they have been forced to collaborate in order to form a Government. Many doubt this so-called experiment will work. I for one think it is desperately needed: politicians in some ways ideological opposed, working together for the common good. Isn’t the common good what politicians are supposed to be working for?
Pity collaboration is not happening in America or Australia where party politics stands in the way of progress. Australian Prime Minister Rudd’s reputation is in tatters because he doesn’t have the numbers to turn his climate change legislation and other reforms into law and so he has back flipped on most of what he promised he would do before he got elected.
On the other side Opposition Leader (what a joke we have such a title) Tony Abbott talks tough and that’s about all, a typical politician, all huff and puff and no courage to put aside differences and actually achieve something that matters for the common good. In recent days Abbott basically admitted on National television that he doesn't always tell truth. His predecessor Malcolm Turnbull at least had courage and appeared to be honest. Sadly he got dumped.
President Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize based on a hope he would lead the world out of the pathetically self-interested way we have been led for centuries. Currently hope is looking hopeless as extraordinary vehemence dominates American politics and as a result necessary real reforms fade into oblivion.
Party politics is a great demonstration of either/or thinking and lies at the heart of the violence that dominates our world. Without party politics would there be such violence?
I vote for independent politicians. My hope is that one day such folk will out number the political parties and we will then have a chance at real democracy.
I've recently seen the movie Julie and Julia. Julie is bored with her Government job. She decides to cook every recipe from the Julia Child cookbook "Mastering the Art of French Cooking" and blog about it. I can't believe I hadn't seen this movie before now! Although I am no cook (my idea of a gourmet meal is something ready-marinaded from Coles) I am a major francophile, and much of the film is set in France. It's based on two true stories, too.
The movie has some great lessons for difference-makers. A blog is a great way to get exposure for your difference-making ideas.
1. Julie set herself the goal of cooking all 524 recipes in 356 days, and to post a blog every single day. To persuade her husband of the merits of her plan, she said "A blog gives you something you have to do every day, one day at a time. It's good for me to have short-term goals". She chose a project and committed to it. Commit to a regular plan. You don't have to blog every single day, but the more often the better. The more you write, the more you find to write about.
2. She persevered with her blog, even though there were no results in the short term - "I feel like I'm sending things into this giant void!". Keep going - it takes a while to get traction and build a fan base.
3. She discovered that her writing had real value for her fan base - "A whole group of people connected with me, who need me in some way. If I didn't write, they would be upset". Write for the people who value what you do.
4. She told the truth and reported on her failings, even with her husband saying "You could lie - there are no aspic police". When she dropped a chicken on the floor and the stuffing fell out, she wrote about it. When a famous food editor cancelled her dinner visit, she admitted it in the blog and shared her disappointment. Be authentic - people want to connect with the real you.
5. Finally Julia's blog was published in the New York Times and offers began to flood in. In what was for me the most poignant scene of the film, Julie exclaims "I'm going to be a writer!" Her husband replies "You are a writer. And she was. She hadn't waited for someone to give her permission to write - she just got on and did it. Be a writer!
6. We also see Julia Child's struggle to get her cookbook published, resulting in many disappointments. She eventually succeeded because her friend Avis knew a publisher. Avis had been her pen-friend and they had got to know each other very well through years of correspondence. The modern equivalent would be someone you had met through LinkedIn but never met in person. Build your online networks!
It's a story of individualism and determination to design one's desired life. Julie and Julia both resolved to do something remarkable and refused to be trapped in ordinariness. Thought leaders need to do that too. No one asked Julie to write a cooking blog - her plan sounded crazy at first. But no one else was doing it, and it proved to be a winner.
Google recently released a new piece of software called "Google Wave". It hasn't received a lot of popular press attention, perhaps because it's not about social media like Facebook or Twitter - and those things are still "flavour of the year".
You might not have noticed it, but collaboration is an important trend today - even if you're a one-person business who makes a living telling other people what to do.
I'm seeing more examples of two or three experts collaborating on books, so readers get the value of their combined expertise.
More successful podcasts are now done as interviews or with multiple presenters, rather than just one person talking into a microphone.
Even audiences are expecting more collaboration during your presentation, as my friend Alicia Curtis points out.
The Internet makes it easier for people to collaborate. Even if those people live in different time zones, different countries, different cultures and live very different lives. They can still come together easily and effectively - certainly far easier than ever before.
These are all examples of modern tools that help people collaborate. And all are available to "normal" people without any particular technical skills.
This is not about the tools and the technology. Sure, the tools are necessary to make the collaboration easier. But it's first about your mindset.
Are you actively seeking ways to collaborate? It really is the way of the future, so if you're not doing it, you're falling behind.
Which colleagues - particularly differencemakers - can you collaborate with easily to bring more value to your clients?
If you're a presenter, how can you enlist audiences in making your next presentation even more effective? (One obvious way is to survey them before your presentation. That's still effective, but what's another way?)
What collaboration technology are you not using yet - but could make a significant difference if you do start using it?
Angela Shanahan’s article in the Weekend Australian May 15-16 2010 tells of how Norway is a shining light amongst much economic doom and gloom.
As I read Angela’s article I asked myself how come I didn’t know this before? and, how come Norway’s story is not headline news all over the world?
If there are other countries out there doing well by doing good please let me know and I will do my bit to spread good news stories.
Here is a great manifesto by two leading edge corporate sustainability practitioners Jeffrey Hollender and Bill Breen.
Fortune Magazine, in an article on its website edition, has done a cover story on the rising popularity of recruiting military officers for leadership. It is easy to understand how someone whose leadership skills were honed in combat would be more qualified for leadership than the candidate whose only leadership test could have been winning the school summer camp obstacle race.
The correlation between military service and leadership ability is well documented. Studies show that companies with military leaders outperform their peers.Many of our nation's most respected companies have discovered a source for talent that traditional recruiting methods often overlook - the men and women of our Armed Services. The leadership skills, core values, integrity, and work ethic of our military transition members provide a bridge to span the leadership gap in our current workforce.
There are seven core values associated with the military: Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Selfless Service, Honour, Integrity and Personal Courage. Let us examine each military value for its usefulnes to the corporate world.
This means showing your faith in your organisation, your leaders and your colleagues. People want to know they can trust you. And you want the same reassurances from others.
Duty - Fulfill your obligations. Accept responsibility for your actions and those entrusted to your care. Find opportunities to improve oneself for the good of the unit.
You've got a job to do and people depend on you to get it done. If someone needs help, give it to them. If you need help, seek it from your peers. Be consistent in action and deed.
How we consider others reflects upon each of us, both personally and as a professional organization. Act courteously toward customers, colleagues and seniors. If you disagree with an opinion or point of view, challenge the position, but avoid the personal attack. Remember that your actions speak volumes about yourself and your business or organization.
Selfless service leads to organizational teamwork and encompasses discipline, self-control and faith in the system.Take care of your co-workers. Go the 'extra mile' for your customers and clients, even if gains you nothing more than some personal satisfaction. Volunteer to take on the tough job, or the mundane job that others avoid.
Live up to the values of your business. Act accordingly, and others will recognize you as an individual of principled character. Don't fall into the trap of, "but I just did what others did before me". Given the choice, take the 'high road'. Distinguish yourself from those who would be satisfied to do less.
Ask yourself, "Is this the right thing to do? How does it reflect on who I am?" If your inner voice is sounding the alarm, it's doing so for a good reason. Avoid shortcuts, cheats, or otherwise doing less than what is expected. Don't compromise yourself, your friends, family or business for some short-term satisfaction. Integrity offers long-term rewards that can't be acquired any other way.
Is a boss asking you to do something questionable? Been in a group that disparages a certain race or ethnicity? It may be safer to go along with the crowd, or do nothing at all. It takes inner strength to stand up to peer pressure and moral dilemmas. It's easy to be a follower - anyone can do that. True leadership requires all of one's audacity, nerve and 'guts' to negotiate the difficult roads that lie before us.
Yes, these men and women who wish to launch their second careers have battle proven leadership ability. But even more importantly they have honour. And the courage to do what is right, even if there is risk of casualties. They are worthy of respect and worthy of trust. They are ready to lead, with integrity.
It is that time of year, and that time in the business cycle when leaders' thoughts turn to strategic planning. No more keeping your head down in bunker mentality mode to ride out the economic crisis - it's time to carve a new path.
I've seen many plans over the course of 25 years or so, and many of them are missing the key components that will help them be successful. When it comes down to it, many business owners invest time, energy, thought, and money in creating plans that don't yield the results they want. Here's what I mean:
The vision-only plan. This plan articulates the owner's dream for the company. It speaks in hearts and flowers about becoming the provider of choice for the products and services it provides. It sometimes talks about geographic expansion, or of being on the leading edge of technology. But it stops short of developing specific, measurable action steps to fulfill its intentions. It becomes, in effect, a castle in the clouds.
The tactics-only plan. This plan is often developed in tandem with the annual budget process. It focuses on the activities for the next year (calendar or fiscal.) But it doesn't reach beyond the limited view of the near-term. So the boots on the ground in the company or organization don't understand why they are doing what they are doing.
The super-secret stuff plan. This is the work of art that is locked securely in a file cabinet so no unauthorized people can get ahold of it. Life in a closely held business means that owners often don't want to share the intimate personal details behind the business. In other cases there are strategies or tactics that are better not shared beyond a limited audience, but usually there are more that can only be accomplished with all hands on deck.
What a plan needs is, in effect, a ladder to connect the boots on the ground with the castle in the clouds. Sure, create that beautiful vision for the future of the company and the grand purpose that galvanizes employees and gives them the sense of doing something significant. But then make the connection to tactics - even down to specific departmental or individual accountabilities that will take the company from point A closer to point B as defined in the plan.
Don't be concerned about a fancy wrapper - rather than a leather binding, give your plan one sheet of paper (highlights, of course) that can live under the glass on an employee's desktop, or on a bulletin board in their workspace. Make it easy to access and it will have greater relevance to day-to-day activities.
Make it measurable. Your staff will be encouraged by visible progress up the rungs of the ladder. This might seem a bit scary if you're not used to making performance measurable and public inside your company. But what's more important to you - feeling comfortable or achieving success? I'm betting that the people who work with you can help you reach that castle, and more quickly than you thought possible.
One of the blogs I subscribe to and gain much from is Jeffrey Hollender’s - The Inspired Protagonist. Recently he referred to a list of books on sustainability that really matter. Please check out the list here.
There are some fascinating and insightful essays here by John Elkington, Bill Drayton, Sally Osberg, Paul Light, Mindy Lubber, and others to answer this question in the What Matters section of McKinsey’s websiite.
I was somewhat surprised by Elkington’s answer and would be interested in your thoughts on his and everyone else’s essays.
I particularly liked Paul Light’s essay on collaboration which for me is the key to bringing about the changes our world so desparately needs.
The ability and willingness to collaborate for the good of people and our planet is the new hallmark of real leadership for me and to date no politician has been able to do it so the baton lies waiting to be picked up by social entrepreneurs, entreprenuers, small business owners, big business owners; for me by insightpreneurs and differencemakers!
Connecting personal leadership, innovation, and sustainability is the key theme for this years differencemakers tour master-classes. You can find out more here.
On 28th April I was interviewed by Gihan Perera of First Step Communications on the subject Is doing good Really good for business.
Is it really the organisation's responsibility, or should they maximise shareholder return and leave it to the shareholders themselves to do the good?
Are organisations just doing this because it's good PR? (And if so, does it matter, as long as the good gets done?)
Are we in danger of doing superficial good and feeling smug about it (e.g. greenwashing), while neglecting the real problems?
I trust that my answers will challenge your mind, stirr your heart, and inspire you to take personal responsibility for sustainability.
The authors of this blog are all members of differencemakers community a participatory third place for people worldwide who are changing what needs to be changed and looking to increase the scale of their differencemaking.
I really dropped the ball on my two post per month minimum as far as August goes, so......... Sorry August. Here we are now September wow time flies!
I started this project which evolved into a business almost a year ago. October to be exact. Well actually it started way before that but the official start was October. Then I became a Tax Paying business in January and we didn't see a true profit until months after. It's been a slow start but the business is still a baby. Just learning to operate and building the strength to one day walk.

Handsome, busy fellow who needs lots of activity, more structure and training than he's had, and a good sized yard and perhaps a play buddy! Burt-Burt is a very nice dog, eager to please and to participate, and he needs things to keep him bus (thus perhaps a second dog) as he was chewing things in prior home, but it was an apartment in Willits, with a postage stamp back yard, a young couple and a two year old child....not the best fit!
He came from a friend of theirs who "breeds wolf hybrids...." from what we can see, this is no wolf hybrid, more Husky-Lab-Kelpy perhaps. He's cute with one ear up, one down, nice chocolate-tri-color with blue eyes...
Burt Burt still needs to be neutered, so we will bring him down from our Sanctuary to the Adoption Center in Point Richmond and get him all "fixed up!"
Burt Burt will make a lovely addition for an active person/family with some dog sense, time and energy!
Jax is a gentle giant! He is a sweet boy who walks well on leash. He loves to snuggle. He knows basic commands, but could use some training and socialization. He would be a great family dog, and would need a family who's is not out of the house much. Come meet this big sweet boy.
Great Pyrenees breeds are described as: "In nature, the Great Pyrenees is confident, gentle (especially with children), and loyal. While territorial and protective of its flock or family when necessary, its general demeanor is of composure and patience and loyalty. It is a strong willed, independent and reserved breed. It is also attentive, quite fearless and loyal to its duties. The Great Pyrenees' size makes it an imposing guardian. A dog of this breed will patrol its perimeter and may wander away if left off its leash in an unenclosed space. The Great Pyrenees protects its flock by barking, and being nocturnal, tends to bark at night unless trained against such behavior.
The Great Pyrenees can be slow to learn new commands, slow to obey, and somewhat stubborn to train."
$600 adoption fee. Taking care of big dogs can be expensive, as is spaying/ neutering and all the rest!

I write stories for both teens and adults. My PULSE OF POWER comic book world was created in high school. I wrote several short stories as part of an assignment and then continued to grow and add volumes to my world through college and graduate school. When the first graphic novel released I was enthralled by the visual aspects. Now, the series is blooming with the main storyline and off-shoot journeys. As my heroine Tia, would say, “Power up! Destiny is a choice.”
My newest book from Sourcebooks, Book #4 of the SEAL series—THE SOUL OF A SEAL— releases on December 6, 2016. A SEAL FOREVER released in 2015. ONCE A SEAL released in 2013. A SEAL AT HEART released in 2012. As a Navy wife, I’ve tried to make the stories as authentic as possible while maintaining a romantic fictional storyline. My husband who is retired from The TEAMS was a great help and this book as well as all future volumes are dedicated to Our Men and Women in Uniform.

A cancer diagnosis is shattering. Life as it was, in its innocence, slips away and we are faced with walking the path of cancer, whatever it brings. What now?
In “When Things Fall Apart”, Pema Chodron remarks that “if we are willing to give up hope that insecurity and pain can be exterminated, then we can have the courage to relax with the groundlessness of our situation. This is the first step of the path.”
But how do we stay present to every moment when we are in pain, when we are scared? How do we make decisions from a wise place? How do we listen to this body and its needs while undergoing treatment? How do we breathe in all of this?
Sometimes the cancer journey actually brings us back to our bodies and to our life – a re-connection, a coming home. It can help us to learn for the first time “maitri”, loving kindness toward oneself. A yoga practice that allows for reflection, that follows what the body needs at every stage, can give us a sense of peace, even momentarily. Gentle movement can help lymph circulation, postures can flush and re-awaken the body, breath can calm and help us to re-centre. Sometimes the practice is only breath. Sometimes more movement is desired. The body can guide us, if we can listen mindfully.
Anne is a Yoga Teacher, Yoga Therapist and a Care Coordinator at the Ottawa Integrative Cancer Centre
Yoga Classes at the Ottawa Integrative Cancer Centre. Enjoy quiet reflection and ease of movement in a unique unhurried yoga class. Open to anyone – people at any stage of the cancer journey; from diagnosis to treatment to those post treatment, caregivers, and staff at the OICC. No experience in yoga necessary.
Yoga therapy is a form of body-centered counseling that draws on the wisdom of yoga and breath practice to turn inward; listening deeply, acknowledging held experience and supporting the body through difficult experiences. No physical flexibility, or experience with yoga is required. Yoga Therapy begins with talking, then noticing and tracking body sensations for guidance. Sometimes the needs are more physical, such as the desire to gently de-toxify from chemo and bolster the immune system through breath practice and gentle movement. Sometimes, the inquiry discovers held emotions; such as diagnosis shock or a chronic anxiety, wanting to be recognized and moved. When very depleted, the body often doesn’t want to move as much as to rest and be held in a bolstered restorative pose. Yoga therapy is more than the practice of yoga. It is profound individualized self- care during challenging times that gives the body a voice. Our practice is to listen.

Weâ€™re having a lot of fun with paper scenes this year- these three were created with prop stylist Birte Von Kampen for Consumer Reports.
3 Eau Claire is the third office tower development to be announced in downtown Calgary and is scheduled to start development later this year. 3 Eau Claire is a mixed use office and residential condominium development that has planned two multi-residential towers to be built on top of the office podium. The development is located in the Eau Claire commercial node in the heart of downtown Calgary. The announcement was covered by the Calgary Herald in an article this morning which can be found here.
Shaw Communications has announced they are going to take 12 floors in the development which will consist of the entire office podium. 3 Eau Claire will be an iconic development for downtown Calgary as the residential towers will be the tallest in the city and linked with a sky bridge on the 40th level.
We have long watched employers in the Calgary market work to distinguish themselves in the eyes of their employees through leasing innovative and high quality office space. Shaw’s move to rebuild their downtown tower and take 12 floors in 3 Eau Claire is a great example of this as the space “will feature rooftop terraces, collaborative work spaces, a wellness centre, and the latest in environmentally sustainable building concepts”.
Shaw's decision to stay in the downtown core is in stark contrast to Imperial Oil choosing to relocate to Quarry Park in Calgary's suburban SE. These two corporate decisions are great examples of Calgary's dynamic office market with each company choosing vastly different locations to attract employees. One reality that is consistent in both these moves is that unique, high quality office space continues to remain sought after in Calgary's tight office market.
On behalf of all our Principals, Shareholders and Employees, we are extremely proud to announce that Avison Young – for the second year in a row – has been named one of Canada’s Best Managed Companies.
The prestigious national award is sponsored by Deloitte, CIBC, National Post, Queen’s School of Business and MacKay CEO forums. The announcement was made yesterday by the national sponsors and in a special report in the National Post daily newspaper.
Winning this prestigious award last year was a monumental achievement; winning again this year shows that our efforts to create a different kind of real estate company are paying off, and that we have established a solid, sustainable organization – one that is built to last.
We could not be more honoured to be associated with our exceptional clients, their belief in Avison Young and the extraordinary people who service their accounts and provide real solutions.
This designation is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our employees, our tremendous growth in recent years, and our differentiated, Principal-led structure. Each Principal has a stake in the success of our firm, which drives a culture of collaboration, co-operation and client focus, across the company. We manage our business without service-line or geographic silos, in order to have a greater positive impact on our clients’ success.
This award is a recognition of our success with clients, our values, our accomplishments and our culture. Among the key pillars of the Avison Young culture are partnership, honesty and integrity. Through these values we have created a loyal base of clients. We applaud the accomplishments of all the Best Managed recipients for their commitment to excellence, and we look forward to continuing to build and sustain a culture that will enable our future success.
Established in 1993, Canada’s Best Managed Companies is a national awards program recognizing Canadian companies that have implemented world-class business practices and created value in innovative ways. Applications are reviewed by an independent judging panel that evaluates how companies address various business challenges, including new technologies, globalization, brand management, leadership, leveraging and developing core competencies, designing information systems, and hiring the right talent to facilitate growth.
Spirits are high when the snow is falling in Whistler. Despite record attendance at this year’s International Council of Shopping Centers conference, it was striking how few retailers were present. Equally noticeable was the shift from a 40%/60% split between investment and leasing professionals to about 80% leasing professionals at this year’s gathering. The absence of buyers was ironic considering this meeting coincided with a bidding war to take over Primaris, a major shopping center REIT at significant premium to NAV (something commonly seen just as a sector peaks).
There was a dazzling array of planned retail development showcased at the conference, all looking for tenants. Cadillac and Oxford continue to expand all of their best malls across Canada. Ivanhoe Cambridge is planning billions of dollars of construction of myriad outlet malls in both the US and Canada. RioCan has entered into a billion dollar Joint Venture with Tanger Outlets to sell some of its Canadian assets and develop discount malls together across Canada. Dozens of regional players (including a number of advisors traditionally more active in industrial product) were rolling out multiple development projects. Major changes lie ahead. It is old news that a large number of prominent US retailers are planning expansions into the Canadian market, and that the per capita square footage of retail space today is lower north of the border. Venerated names such as Victoria’s Secret, Gap, Coach; Staples, Lowe’s and Home Depot; Apple, Starbucks, Crate and Barrel, Body Shop, Williams Sonoma and Nine West, among others are firmly ensconced in the Canadian landscape. Nordstrom and Target are opening their first stores in the spring. These retailers are the best of the best, and will raise the bar on service and merchandising in Canada. If the American experience is indicative, significant fallout among smaller players is likely.
Those who got here first have found a very fertile ground north of the 49th parallel; in fact some are continuing to expand, confident that despite increasing competition their market share can be greater. For example, Walmart’s response to more competition from Target is to launch 4.3 million square feet of planned expansion, of both existing stores and by adding nearly 30 new stores, detailed here: (http://www.thestar.com/business/2012/04/12/walmarts_plan_to_battle_target_dollarama_in_canada.html). The CBC and Globe and Mail recently highlighted the reason why this market is so good: retail prices average 10 to 50 percent higher in Canada than prices for the same goods in the United States. But when we look at the impact of internet shopping combined with the fact millions of Canadians cross the border every year to buy everyday goods, school supplies, specialty goods, coats, sporting goods, shoes and just about everything else(besides pharmaceuticals, which remain astonishingly cheaper in Canada), it raises the question, just how much more retail space do we need?
Target wisely decided that the most sensible way to enter the market was to acquire stores of the failing Canadian discount chain, Zellers (Great merchandise, no staff, long lines, best locations). Target brings to this market its uniquely effective customer targeting and micromarketing systems that enable it to compete so effectively with WalMart. (For more information about this system and how it manipulates consumer behaviour pick up the book - The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business by Charles Duhigg, February, 2012). Bloomingdales is trying to strike a deal with The Bay who still holds the anchor position in most high end Canadian malls, recognizing the department store format is garnering smaller and smaller overall market share. Lowe’s is trying to take out Canadian competitor Rona over the Province of Quebec’s strenuous objections. But this will not help, they are coming, either way.
Takeaways, 1) not all of the planned space will be delivered. 2) much of the space being planned is discount oriented, what is referred to in the US as “category killer” retail. 3) Vastly better capitalized, and accustomed to thriving in an environment of much tighter margins, these multi-national companies will change the landscape of Canadian retailing, 4) if you are holding marginal retail assets you might want to begin to think strongly about bringing them to market, the playing field is about to get a lot tougher.
Avison Young was extremely excited to announce last week that Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ), one of Canada’s leading institutional fund managers, has made a $250-million preferred equity investment to accelerate Avison Young’s strategic growth plan.
This transaction is another milestone in the history of Avison Young, and we have never been more excited about our plans to enhance our platform, disrupt and differentiate ourselves against our competitors, and continue to be recognized as our clients’ solutions provider of choice.
We will use the proceeds to invest in acquisitions and the recruitment of key professionals, fuelling our company’s ongoing growth of our global footprint and service-line capabilities. In addition, a portion of the proceeds will be used to repurchase the shares held by the firm’s current private equity partner, Parallel49 Equity (formerly known as Tricor Pacific Capital Inc.), as well as shares of certain other non-management founders and former Principals of Avison Young.
With $298.5 billion in net assets, CDPQ’s global portfolio of investments spans across various markets and sectors, including private equity, real estate and infrastructure.

The field of beam physics touches many areas of physics, engineering and the sciences. In general terms, beams describe ensembles of particles with initial conditions similar enough to be treated together as a group so that the motion is a weakly nonlinear perturbation of a chosen reference particle. Particle beams are used in a variety of areas, ranging from electron microscopes, particle spectrometers, medical radiation facilities, powerful light sources, astrophysics to large synchrotrons and storage rings such as the LHC at CERN.
An Introduction to Beam Physics is based on lectures given at Michigan State University's Department of Physics and Astronomy, the online VUBeam program, the U.S. Particle Accelerator School, the CERN Academic Training Programme and various other venues. It is accessible to beginning graduate and upper-division undergraduate students in physics, mathematics engineering. The book begins with a historical overview of methods for generating and accelerating beams, showcasing important developments through the eyes of their developers using their original drawings. This is followed by concepts of linear beam optics, transfer matrices, the general equations of motion, as well as the main techniques used for single- and multi-pass systems. Some advanced nonlinear topics including the computation of aberrations and a study of resonances round out the presentation.
Note: The first printing of the book contained errors in the publisher-prepared text of the front matter. The book has subsequently been re-printed, and the proper version can be identified by a yellow circle with the text "0105 2015" on the lower right of the back cover. All traceable copies of the incorrect earlier version have been recalled, and any remaining incorrect copies can be exchanged free of charge by contacting the editor following these instructions.
An introduction to recent work on analysis over the nonarchimedean Levi-Civita field related to applications for common numerical tasks is provided. After studying the algebraic, order, and topological properties, a calculus is developed under which central concepts like the intermediate value theorem, mean value theorem, and Taylor�s theorem with remainder hold under slightly stronger conditions. Most importantly for practical applications, it allows the computation of derivatives of real functions as difference quotients with infinitesimal increment.
“the news is probably more like a a catalyst for some retracement(cooldown) of an overheated market anyway. The price surges we have seen over the last 2 weeks have been quite exaggerated. We might see now some days/weeks of a more stable price development,” he stated. We are also in regular exchange with officials of the State Bank of Vietnam in order to bring our industry insights to the table while making sure we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. I think this is just the natural state of things if you are serious about building a long-term perspective for your business.”
The inquiry launched by the People’s Bank of China into BTCC, OKcoin and Huobi Bitcoin exchanges on Friday January 6 may be a catalyst for some retracement – a temporary reversal in the direction of a price that goes against the prevailing trend – in the market, said Dominik Weil of Bitcoin Vietnam.
According to Caixin, China’s top financial news media, PBOC has told the threes exchanges that the devaluation of yuan should not be mentioned in their promotions and has reiterated the importance of Anti-money Laundering Law of China. Furthermore, PBOC said the three exchanges should not conduct off-line promotions in China. Specifically, PBOC has warned BTCC that fake trading records(machine transactions) shall not happen again.
Chinese government’s policy and behaviors are always subtle and important. The “inquiry” in Chinese literally means “to meet and talk”( yue tan 约谈). In Chinese Stock Exchanges, CEO of companies whose stock price is abnormally volatile or whose capital operation has potential to greatly impact the market like major acquisition and buy-out could be inquired by China Securities Regulatory Commission. The inquiry in many cases is just a softened reminding or if any, warning. It can also be the initial stage of an investigation in some cases, though.
While it is being misconstrued for a ban by some media, the meeting neither mentioned a ban on Bitcoin-related trading nor any other form of restrictive measure on Bitcoin trading itself.
In a short statement from BTCC regarding the announcement, the Chinese exchange which touts itself as the longest running in the world, notes that the meeting with the PBOC was not the first of its kind and that the press release issued only outlines the significant volatility in Bitcoin trading and a reminder that the digital currency does not have a legal tender status.
The meeting with the three exchanges that account for 90% of the global Bitcoin trading was meant to remind the exchanges of their need to operate in accordance with the laws and regulations of China and to conduct self-examination. It comes after the price of Bitcoin recorded a wild volatility in a couple of days.
BTCC has participated the meet-up with PBOC and Financial Office of Shanghai. It has introduced the current status of BTCC. BTCC will operate strictly in accordance with Chinese laws and regulations as it has long been done. BTCC will actively conduct self-examination and correction of any irregularity. BTCC will firmly help government to uphold market stability and guard interests of investors. BTCC’s reminder:In accordance of Joint Notice of People’s bank of China, Ministry of Industry and Information, China Securities Regulatory Commission China Banking Regulatory Commission on Bitcoin Risk Prevention, Bitcoin is a specific virtual goods. It is not law-based and compulsory like currency thus does not have the legal status as a currency. It shall not, should not be circulated as a currency in the market. Individuals and agencies should properly treat virtual goods and virtual currency. They should invest with rationale in Bitcoin and thus bear the possible risks by their own.

However, learning how to write letters efficiently can take a lot of patience and time, and of course the experience necessary to write a good one. What should you do if this is the first time to write a letter? Do not fret, a letter template can help you a whole lot in writing a formal letter that stands out.
In fact, a number of businesses use templates to draft their letters for any business-related intent. Letter templates help them save time and energy, making their tasks easy and quick. Aside from that, templates also help craft high quality formal letters which reflect the image of a specific enterprise. That’s the reason several companies invest in a system which permits them to access formal letter templates easily.
You can choose from an assortment of templates available online. When trying to find a letter template, ensure you pick the one with a suitable layout and format. A fantastic template format includes the following details in their proper order.
An specific address of the company. A state and zip code and date. The entire title of the letter’s recipient and the company name of the recipient. It should also include, the business department and the company address and zip code. You should include salutation. Avoid including the first name of the person. You can put”Dear Sir” or the surname. Include an opening paragraph and make it as brief as possible. Then progress to the body of the letter, final paragraph including a call-to-action statement. Finally it should include a sign off. This could be”Yours sincerely” or”Yours faithfully”. Contain these items and you have yourself a formal letter.

“I have loved you for years. I have been in love with you for years and years and years ... throughout school and training ... before transitions and afterward ... when you approached me and yes, even now that you're with Saxton and you hate me.

“I ain't...Don't know how to say it up right. Never--Fuck, Chess. Thought you was dead once before, you recall? Never felt so bad in my life, not ever. Then on the other day, thought you was gone and just....I can't do it, bein without you.” -Terrible

Asteya is the third of the Yamas. The awareness of what we covet and our ability to refrain from coveting or stealing that very thing. So, what does this have to do with inversions? Well…
I am terrified of going upside down. It is a fear I’ve harboured since I was a child. When I look on Pinterest, or at Yoga Journal or any number of sites that celebrate yoga poses, the inversion is king. Do a handstand and you’ve “made it” in the yoga world. Or, at least, that’s the message I am receiving when I look at the glossy mags on the stand in the bookstores.
In all honesty, I am cynical and angry because I don’t feel as though handstands or other arm balances are accessible to me. I look to my neighbours on the mat moving into crow or balancing on their heads and I am jealous….I want that. It is something I covet. While I celebrate their hand-balancing successes (and I truly am excited for anyone who has the ability to invert themselves) there is also a sense of loss and frustration that comes with it for me personally.
Now, I’m not talking about stealing in the sense of an object or coveting another person’s belongings, but I am coveting that persons abilities and skills. Rather than celebrate and continue to practice, I sometimes just look on longingly at my fellow yogis wishing I had what I seemingly don’t.
At the same time, this brings back the first Yama – Ahisma (do no harm). I am not willing to go full throttle into a inverted situation that I am not feeling comfortable with. I believe I would do more harm than good to my mental, emotional and physical state.
Are you afraid of headstands/handstands/arm-balancing? Were you ever and overcame it? Tell me about it!
Returning to the situation discussed by the Rav of Kutna, we close this post with excerpts of a famous novelistic account of a lover (and an unprofessed one, at that) who remains faithful to his beloved even after she has been disfigured, also apparently by smallpox:
I lay ill through several weeks, and the usual tenor of my life became like an old remembrance. But this was not the effect of time so much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness and inaction of a sick–room. Before I had been confined to it many days, everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance where there was little or no separation between the various stages of my life which had been really divided by years. In falling ill, I seemed to have crossed a dark lake and to have left all my experiences, mingled together by the great distance, on the healthy shore. …
By and by my strength began to be restored. Instead of lying, with so strange a calmness, watching what was done for me, as if it were done for some one else whom I was quietly sorry for, I helped it a little, and so on to a little more and much more, until I became useful to myself, and interested, and attached to life again. …
First I complimented Charley on the room, and indeed it was so fresh and airy, so spotless and neat, that I could scarce believe I had been lying there so long. This delighted Charley, and her face was brighter than before.
Poor little Charley looked round too and pretended to shake her head as if there were nothing absent.
“And yet,” said I, “I miss some familiar object. Ah, I know what it is, Charley! It’s the looking–glass.”
Charley got up from the table, making as if she had forgotten something, and went into the next room; and I heard her sob there.
I had thought of this very often. I was now certain of it. I could thank God that it was not a shock to me now. I called Charley back, and when she came—at first pretending to smile, but as she drew nearer to me, looking grieved—I took her in my arms and said, “It matters very little, Charley. I hope I can do without my old face very well.”
I was presently so far advanced as to be able to sit up in a great chair and even giddily to walk into the adjoining room, leaning on Charley. The mirror was gone from its usual place in that room too, but what I had to bear was none the harder to bear for that. …
And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to keep. I had thought, sometimes, that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that if he had been richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me before he went away. I had thought, sometimes, that if he had done so, I should have been glad of it. But how much better it was now that this had never happened! What should I have suffered if I had had to write to him and tell him that the poor face he had known as mine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him from his bondage to one whom he had never seen!
Oh, it was so much better as it was! With a great pang mercifully spared me, I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all he had so brightly shown himself; and there was nothing to be undone: no chain for me to break or for him to drag; and I could go, please God, my lowly way along the path of duty, and he could go his nobler way upon its broader road; and though we were apart upon the journey, I might aspire to meet him, unselfishly, innocently, better far than he had thought me when I found some favour in his eyes, at the journey’s end.8
For I had not yet looked in the glass and had never asked to have my own restored to me. I knew this to be a weakness which must be overcome, but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh when I got to where I now was. Therefore I had wanted to be alone, and therefore I said, now alone, in my own room, “Esther, if you are to be happy, if you are to have any right to pray to be true–hearted, you must keep your word, my dear.” I was quite resolved to keep it, but I sat down for a little while first to reflect upon all my blessings. And then I said my prayers and thought a little more.
My hair had not been cut off, though it had been in danger more than once. It was long and thick. I let it down, and shook it out, and went up to the glass upon the dressing–table. There was a little muslin curtain drawn across it. I drew it back and stood for a moment looking through such a veil of my own hair that I could see nothing else. Then I put my hair aside and looked at the reflection in the mirror, encouraged by seeing how placidly it looked at me. I was very much changed—oh, very, very much. At first my face was so strange to me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back but for the encouragement I have mentioned. Very soon it became more familiar, and then I knew the extent of the alteration in it better than I had done at first. It was not like what I had expected, but I had expected nothing definite, and I dare say anything definite would have surprised me.
I had never been a beauty and had never thought myself one, but I had been very different from this. It was all gone now. Heaven was so good to me that I could let it go with a few not bitter tears and could stand there arranging my hair for the night quite thankfully.
One thing troubled me, and I considered it for a long time before I went to sleep. I had kept Mr. Woodcourt’s flowers. When they were withered I had dried them and put them in a book that I was fond of. Nobody knew this, not even Ada. I was doubtful whether I had a right to preserve what he had sent to one so different—whether it was generous towards him to do it. I wished to be generous to him, even in the secret depths of my heart, which he would never know, because I could have loved him—could have been devoted to him. At last I came to the conclusion that I might keep them if I treasured them only as a remembrance of what was irrevocably past and gone, never to be looked back on any more, in any other light. I hope this may not seem trivial. I was very much in earnest.9
We were standing by the opened window looking down into the street when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me. I learned in a moment that he loved me. I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to him. I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted, generous, faithful love. Oh, too late to know it now, too late, too late. That was the first ungrateful thought I had. Too late.
“When I returned,” he told me, “when I came back, no richer than when I went away, and found you newly risen from a sick bed, yet so inspired by sweet consideration for others and so free from a selfish thought—”
“Oh, Mr. Woodcourt, forbear, forbear!” I entreated him. “I do not deserve your high praise. I had many selfish thoughts at that time, many!”
“Heaven knows, beloved of my life,” said he, “that my praise is not a lover’s praise, but the truth. You do not know what all around you see in Esther Summerson, how many hearts she touches and awakens, what sacred admiration and what love she wins.”
“Oh, Mr. Woodcourt,” cried I, “it is a great thing to win love, it is a great thing to win love! I am proud of it, and honoured by it; and the hearing of it causes me to shed these tears of mingled joy and sorrow—joy that I have won it, sorrow that I have not deserved it better; but I am not free to think of yours.”
I said it with a stronger heart, for when he praised me thus and when I heard his voice thrill with his belief that what he said was true, I aspired to be more worthy of it. It was not too late for that. Although I closed this unforeseen page in my life to–night, I could be worthier of it all through my life. And it was a comfort to me, and an impulse to me, and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so.
“I should poorly show the trust that I have in the dear one who will evermore be as dear to me as now”—and the deep earnestness with which he said it at once strengthened me and made me weep—“if, after her assurance that she is not free to think of my love, I urged it. Dear Esther, let me only tell you that the fond idea of you which I took abroad was exalted to the heavens when I came home. I have always hoped, in the first hour when I seemed to stand in any ray of good fortune, to tell you this. I have always feared that I should tell it you in vain. My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to–night. I distress you. I have said enough.”
Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me, and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained! I wished to help him in his trouble, as I had wished to do when he showed that first commiseration for me.
“Dear Mr. Woodcourt,” said I, “before we part to–night, something is left for me to say. I never could say it as I wish—I never shall—but—”
“—I am deeply sensible of your generosity, and I shall treasure its remembrance to my dying hour. I know full well how changed I am, I know you are not unacquainted with my history, and I know what a noble love that is which is so faithful. What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips, for there are none that could give it such a value to me. It shall not be lost. It shall make me better.”
He covered his eyes with his hand and turned away his head. How could I ever be worthy of those tears? …
He left me, and I stood at the dark window watching the street. His love, in all its constancy and generosity, had come so suddenly upon me that he had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears.
But they were not tears of regret and sorrow. No. He had called me the beloved of his life and had said I would be evermore as dear to him as I was then, and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words. My first wild thought had died away. It was not too late to hear them, for it was not too late to be animated by them to be good, true, grateful, and contented. How easy my path, how much easier than his!10

...there is no hope for the Palestinians to bring about the end of occupation through the support of western governments or the UN, the only hope that the Palestinians have is through BDS.
Israel isn’t under any threat from boycott movement, but fighting a phony BDS war is too tempting for many to pass up.
The BDS Movement was the outcome of several events that shaped the Palestinian national struggle and international solidarity with the Palestinian people following the Second Uprising (Intifada) in 2000.
"After decades of Palestinian dispossession and Israeli military occupation and apartheid, the United Nations has taken its first concrete, practical step to secure accountability for ongoing Israeli violations of Palestinian human rights,” said Omar Barghouti.

"You see, John Hodgman likes Page-A-Day calendars. He expressed his disappointment that his first book wasn't a Page-A-Day calendar, but noted with relief that this was one of the problems remedied in his new book. He selected a page and boasted that the single page served multiple functions. Yes, it was a page of prose, but furthermore, it was yet a single page in a Page-A-Day calendar contained in the new book. And much like a normal Page-A-Day calendar, he explained, when the day is done, you just [tear it out.]
After ripping the page from the book, Hodgman slipped it back between the adjacent pages, and returned the book to its newly-chagrined owner."
From the outset, it was clear that Google's Diwali celebration would be a festival of lights, music, dance, and tradition. What became increasingly clear as the afternoon turned to evening though, was that this was also a celebration of family, friendship, and community. In this image, parents teach their daughter how to properly light a candle. The care they took conveyed the importance of that knowledge, and of the Diwali celebration as a whole.
Johannesburg, March 4, 2016 – As the digital landscape evolves, it’s important that companies have deeper understanding of their customers to ensure advertising effectiveness.

Leadership development should always be evolving to adapt to new conditions and make use of new ideas. Enter Deborah Rowland of the London School of Economics who wrote an intriguing piece on their blog, titled, “Leadership development today requires that faculty act less as experts, more as Sherpas.” Here’s the golden kernel.
“Sherpas are a tribe from the Nepalese Himalayas, whose social custom has been to provide humane and courageous guides to climbers visiting their region. There are five features of the Sherpa role that I believe form the essence of the leadership development faculty requirements of today:
3. The key Sherpa’s skill is one of deep listening, to make continued and wise adjustments to the journey
4. Having said that, good Sherpas plan the route carefully, knowing (enough of) the terrain, fixing the ropes in place
5. The deep social custom of the original ethnic Sherpas group was to help imbue each tour with spiritual meaning – climbing the peaks is a sacred act.”
This is a fascinating concept, but I wonder what it would look like in real life. The article reads like the Sherpas are members of a leadership development faculty. But, real Sherpas “walk alongside the climber,” they’re part of the expedition and share in the danger of the journey.
There are obviously other details to work out, like who selects the objective. How do we select/develop Sherpas for leadership development? Taking people to their edge “without having them fall” sounds like a good thing. I wonder where you find enough people who can bring it off consistently. What happens if an aspiring leader goes over the edge?
Leadership development must change because leadership is constantly changing. Leadership challenges change and so communication and training methods. The Sherpa concept isn’t an answer. It’s the starting point for more questions and prototypes.

May 15, 2015: With the LED lighting industry growing at a rapid pace, the industry holds enormous business opportunity for all stakeholders, including manufacturers, system integrators, traders, etc. These opportunities include small commercial retrofit projects calling for 100 to 200 bulbs. There are even bigger projects like big government projects. However, the system integrators are not too happy with their position in the industry.
LED system integrators are basically the community that procure all subsystems of a project from different OEMs and integrate them into a project. They are, in fact, the interface between the customer and the OEMs.
So why do so few integrators pursue LED lighting business successfully? Even those who already are doing business in this domain, are looking for new ways to diversify and grow.
Lack of knowledge of the technology: The main challenges that the integrators face are a lack of knowledge of the technology; not knowing what the business model looks like; not knowing which bulbs to buy; and not knowing where to turn to learn what they need to know to proceed.
Most integrators are unaware of the advances made in LED bulb technology over the past few years. But it?s high time that they make themselves conversant with at least the basics of LED technology because more and more residential and commercial customers are now asking for LED-based solutions.
Industry is not user-friendly: The commercial lighting industry is not too user friendly to the integrators. Most lighting supply companies do not have proper catalogues or price sheets; their price quoting is very arbitrary; they do not stock the most innovative, advances and expensive LEDs; most of their products are not certified for quality and reliability.
Manufacturers act as integrators: In the LED industry, many manufacturers act as integrators as well and, therefore, they are in a more advantageous position as they are not only aware of the technology and the developments that are taking place, but can also use the products manufactured by themselves. Here the integrator community find it hard to compete.
Need to re-brand their services as energy management: Many integrators, due to lack of knowledge and lack of marketing strategies, are not aware how to sell their services. Majority of them sell home and light commercial control systems, but hardly a few market their services as energy management products and services. Hence, there is a dire need to re-brand their services as energy management solutions, and re-branding themselves as energy management experts.
Lack of standards: The industry lacks standards for LED lights, making it tough for the integrators to satisfy the customers with quality products. Since LED lights have long lifespan, is is risky for the integrators to stand by the reliability of a product as there is not uniform standards for LED lighting products.

UPDATE: The next BlogBlast For Peace launch is November 4, 2014. Click the logo below to get your peace globe. Don't miss it!
June 2007 : I've visited over 150 blogs tonight with many more to go. Awesome! I want to comment on everyone's before I move on to the next post. Still collecting globes and adding them to the gallery. It is past midnight and there are 300 linkies here. Amazing...!! Right now, I need to get some rest. See you tomorrow. Keep sending them in. It will still be Dona Nobis Pacem day tomorrow....won't it? Of course! Thank you for such an incredible day in the blogosphere. Really inspiring. Stay tuned. I just found a peace globe from a mmmm..mmm...mouse. (I smell a story.)
Pre-script: Please remember to leave a comment at the end of this post along with your url in the box provided so that I may continue to document this event.If you'd like to have the linky code for this event, just email and I will send it to you.
This is Mimi Pencil Skirt reporting live from the lovely land of the Peace Globes. This post was written just before midnight on the eve of the first Dona Nobis Pacem in the Blogosphere - quite unexpectedly inspired by a bowl of marbles - and a loving, gentle tap on the shoulder by someone I loved and lost. I am still amazed at how the story of the Peace Globes really began. Many of you are posting a globe for the first time today and do not know this story. For you, I shall tell it again. And for those who began this journey with me last year, thank you from the bottom of my pencil-skirted heart for allowing me to introduce you, once again, to this honorable man. I am proud to know you.
They've been sitting on my piano for more years than I care to count - on the corner of the Kohler and Campbell my grandfather gave me when I was fourteen years old. After he died, I found them in a tattered and dirty bag at the bottom of a box full of his personal things. He wanted me to have them. His marbles.
Handmade roughhewn marbles crafted from rock by my grandfather and his brothers. The year was 1920 and there was no money for toys.
I often wondered why he didn't leave them for a male member of the family. Honestly, folks. It wasn't until just tonight - the eve of Dona Nobis Pacem in the Blogosphere - that I discovered the answer.
I knew this post would not be written until the last moment. I made lots of notes but I just couldn't quite make it happen. It is still a little while before midnight in my part of the United States and I'm supposed to be spinning out a masterpiece of goodwill and peace prose - maybe a stunning poem like those we've already seen. A song, a lyric, a new tune.
So I went into my study and began to polish them. One by one. The bowl, the piano, the granite. How many times have I sat at that very bench and casually glanced into that bowl? Thousands. Song after song.
He didn't have a lot of money it seems to me now, my grandfather. At the time though, he was the richest man I knew. And he has been on my mind this week more often than not. Well over six-feet tall and always impeccably dressed, my Papa was the most humble man I've ever met.
When he passed away I met scores of people who told me what he'd meant to them. "He helped me when I needed money....." "He gave me his shoes...." and on and on.
His kindness was not news to me. The fact that a large portion of the town showed up at his wake was, however, a stunning surprise. I didn't know I'd been sharing him all those years.
Strange, those marbles. All different shapes and sizes. Colors, too. Yet they've co-existed for years right there atop the long- lovingly- played strings inside my piano - the one Papa used his savings account to buy for me - while he worked two jobs at the factory and made time up on Saturdays when he missed work hours to drive me to my lessons.
I was a bit different. Artistic. Content with solitude. Always writing in endless journals and playing broody piano music. Papa didn't pamper me - even though that's a disputed fact to this day in my family.
When I think about peace and what it means to me, I always wander back to a time when I first felt it. Because I know on an unconscious level that world peace cannot - will not - be achieved without inner peace. Adversaries on both sides of the conflict have to have it. You can't weave magical tranquility out of thin air and conferences. Peace is a state of being.
Real lasting peace is born of creative jumble and hard work. Victories are never won by the one who has the most power - wars are won; but not a state of peace. Nothing good can ever come of power at play for the sake of power.
For me, it came in the presence of God at an early age. Not because I am privileged or special. But simply because I was loved. Unconditionally.
I often wondered how other people sensed that about him - without the benefit of those life-giving hugs he saved just for me.
I often went with him to backwoods church services. Informal revivals, formal services, anywhere there was special music and a spirit of God - he was there. I can't explain it really. We would visit churches and the minister would ask him to lead the invocation or say the benediction - even though they'd never met. How did they know he could pray? I knew he could pray......but how did they know?
Taking his hat off and bowing his head, he would very quietly hold audience with his Maker. It didn't matter how many people were listening. His prayers always began the same way......"Dear Gracious Heavenly Father......"
One night he took me by the hand and led me to the altar with him. He knelt down on one knee, elbow resting on the other and silently voiced his heart. I was right there! I heard the whole thing and he never said a word.
Tonight I'm sitting at my table writing stories on an electronic device that sends messages to a guy in Canada about globe graphics and insomnia, making pots of endless coffee to stay awake, answering emails from Germany, London, China, New York , Oman and beyond.
Oh forget about it. They're just a bunch of rocks. You've got a story to write. Can't you think of something brilliant? It's past midnight and everyone has their peace globe up but you.
When it hit me, I was way past the point of arguing with myself about miracles and such. I've seen too many come through my mailbox today to argue with God about that.
Dona Nobis Pacem did not start with Mimi. It started in 1920 when a little boy in the rural southeastern United States decided to shape a small blue marble - for his granddaughter.
The earth-like nature of the marble struck me immediately, reminding me of the show Big Blue Marble. Beautiful post about your grandfather - you might well really like the children's book by Doug Wood, Grandad's Prayers of the Earth. My globe is up now - thanks for organizing this!
cs - Sounds like a great book and one I definitely want to read. Thanks for recommending. I hope you are enjoying BlogBlast. I can't wait to get to your site and read what you've written.
Turnbaby -I'm so excited I can't sleep. It's like Christmas at Bloggingham Palace tonight. All these beautiful posts and globes floating around.
Mine is up. And my friend Julie at http://www.juliesjewelsandjunque.blogspot.com/ has a globe up. I told her to email it to you for the gallery.
Thanks for the post, Travis,and the participation AND your honest posts. I'm sending you the linky code. I figured it out.
The Pacific NorthWest checks in Mimi - what a beautiful story. A few more minutes and my globe is up! Peace to you
Can't wait to see your globe and read the post. I'm so excited to meet new bloggers and hear what they have to say on the subject.
round two of peace globes. may this magic for peace make a difference in our world. right there with you Mimi. Got my globes up.
I'm so sorry - blogger has put me on the linky 3 times! But in the spirit of peace day I know you'll not be mad with me... esp as I PROMISE I only hit 'enter' once. Ok so I was impatient and I did hit 'refresh' a couple of times while the computer was chugging slowly along....
Well I am at work and definately not supposed to be posting on my blog, but I just couldn't wait. Mine is up and flying proudly. (Took me awhile though cause our internet link just went down at the office :-( )
This is my first year and I just read your story, or should I say, your papa's story...and how beautiful and moving it is! What a wonderful legacy he has tenderly given you!
That is a beautiful tribute to your grandfather and a wonderful story about the inspiration for the Peace Globes. I am a late entry, but I did e-mail my globe and it is flying at my blog.
Please pray for the people in OMAN right now. There's at least one peace globe flyer there. Going to check on her now.....
I just got an email from an African spammer. Wrong day to mess with Mims. I know I shouldn't have but I did. His letter began "I know this mail will come to you as a surprise...etc"
I replied, "I know that this reply will come to you as a surprise. Just hush and get a peace globe."
I'm used to being the only Marilyn. I would have added something to my name if I'd read through all the names before I linked... anyway, I'm up. Thank you so much for doing this.
Thanks so much for doing this!! What a wonderful idea and I'm so proud to participate. Everyone's globes are so unique and beuatiful, too. They really sum everything up.
Marilyn - Welcome and I will have a peek at your site in a bit. What an amazing day. Thank you and peace to you and yours.
Thank-you for letting me read this most wonderful tribute and peace post. Thank-you for this chance to be apart of something close to my heart, and giving me the opportunity to learn about your lovely Grandad
Jamie - Did you say number SIX? No kidding? But the way this community is responding,nothing would surprise me today.
Your post reminded me of the lovely Eddie Fisher recording of "Oh My Papa". You tube didn't have that one, but this is a nice substitute:
Your story reminded me of the great Eddie Fisher song. I couldn't find the original on You Tube, buy here is the song:
Cheysuli - I'm sure there are others. If I were you, I'd write a campaign speech and place it in this comment box! I'll even let you have Persian Patti Cakes for a press secretary.
Glad you like the peace globe story. It came as quite a surprise to me last November! Now that's my kind of story. Thanks for participating.
Thank you for letting a newbie like me in on the origin of the peace globe movement. You were and are very lucky to have had such a warm soul as a grandfather. I am sure he is looking down upon you with a big proud smile on his face.
I am so thrilled and happy to see so many Peace Globes around the Blogosphere today. If nothing else is accomplished by this then at least we know that hundreds, if not more, were thinking of the same thing today and sending those good thoughts and vibrations out into the Universe.
I am really happy to have been a part of this movement. I loved your story about your grandfather's marbles, it was perfect. Thank you for this great idea!
Dearest Mimi, look at the response from the blogosphere!! I am so excited. I just got my post up. And I am #234 on Mister Linky here. WOW!
Purrs for Peace, Mimi! Hey, if you still need a globe in Idaho, the Piney Woods Girls gotcha covered (in fur). They were the Calico Girls, but then a tabby found them, so... Name Change!
Just a quick note to let you know I've posted in my blog. A bit tardy but I didn't forget. Thank you for creating such a lovely movement & for inviting the rest of us to participate.
Oh, Mimi - I´m amazed! So many peaceful bloggers out there - so many wonderful Peace Globes flying... What a happy day!
Hey. I learned about this through Doctor Anonymous. Did a little bit about the Peace Corps, too; hope that's okay.
Thank you so much for this beautiful posting, all the work you´ve done and time you´ve spend on this peaceful project. You´re inspiring!
How could I have gone to all 250 (as of 5:00PM CDT) links here and posted a comment and not commented here????
There might be different reasons, intentions and perspectives in doing this and I respect them all. I do it may way as I believe i sharing culture, traditions and habits is a way to brake down misunderstanding and barriers. So I say: Make Blogs Not Wars!
Bond - You were one of the first to fly the Peace Globe banner this year in a big way. It was huge at the top of your blog! Meant a lot to me and I thank you now for all your encouragement and friendship.
Sanni - You have been with us since the beginning of Dona Nobis Pacem. Bud and I enjoy your light spirit and warm kindness in the blogosphere.
Thank you for your real tribute to your grandfather. Like you, I have an enormous affection for my grandpa, who passed away in 1981. I was named for him, my given name is Ralph III...this of itself is quite an honor. My grandpa was from West Virginia, with only an 8'th grade education, had as much innate intelligence as anyone I have met in my life (and I'm 52 now), just a sensible, hard working, great man. I wrote on my site earlier about Ralph (I), and he was the man in Steubenville, Ohio. I really enjoyed meeting your Papa, as he sounded very much like mine. Thanks for a wonderful day and your site!
Ralph - So we share grandpa stories? Great!~ I'll visit your site and catch up. He was, and still is, an inspiration to me; in all ways that matter.
Savvy - I so enjoy your creative site and gentle spirit. Thank you for participating. It is awesome today!
Beautiful Mimi, I made a comment earlier today but I don't see it so the gremlins that follow me around the blogosphere must have eaten it. (hee hee)
I'm about half-way through my normal rounds. I'm looking forward to clicking on some links and checking out some Peace Globes.
Travis - Good to see you again. I just now started to read posts and really look at globes. I have to tell ya - I'm shedding a few tears here in Banister.
Lara - Thank YOU for participating and I will surely be over to read your post soon. So many great new blogs to read!
ha ha - I see several people have now posted their names forty three times in a row... ok that's an exaggeration.
Yes, congratulations Mimi, and thanks for everything you've done. It's a beautiful thing. Your grandfather would be immensely proud.
What an incredible story! What's even more amazing is what a great story teller you are my dear! Wow...you are just awesome...absolutely awesome.
Now playing "Dona Nobis Pacem"Brew a cup of coffee and come into the castle. I like to play barefoot.

Adele was born Adele Marie Austerlitz in Omaha, Nebraska; the daughter of Johanna "Ann" (née Geilus), an American Lutheran-native of German descent, and Frederic "Fritz" Emanuel Austerlitz (September, 1868–1924), an Austrian Roman Catholic brewer from Vienna.

Adele was born Adele Marie Austerlitz in Omaha, Nebraska; the daughter of Johanna "Ann" (née Geilus), an American Lutheran-native of German descent, and Frederic "Fritz" Emanuel Austerlitz (September, 1868–1924), an Austrian Roman Catholic brewer from Vienna. Adele became an Episcopalian like her younger brother. In 1905 Adele Astaire had a successful vaudeville act with her younger brother Fred Astaire. They developed it into a celebrated adult career on Broadway and on the London stage. Adele was the bigger star of the two during their time performing together, and she was a special favorite of Great Britain's royalty. Fred Astaire with his sister Adele in 1921 On May 9, 1932, after a successful stint with Fred in the revue The Band Wagon (1931) on Broadway, Adele Astaire retired from the stage to marry Lord Charles Arthur Francis Cavendish (August 29, 1905 - March 23, 1944), the second son of the 9th Duke of Devonshire, and moved to Ireland, where they lived at Lismore Castle.
She had three children, a daughter in 1933 and twin sons in 1935, each of whom died soon after birth. On April 20, 1947, Adele Cavendish married her second husband, Col. Kingman Douglass, an American investment banker and Air Force officer who was an assistant director of the Central Intelligence Agency. He died in 1971. After Fred Astaire's success in Hollywood, Adele gave serious consideration in 1935 to making a musical film there.
She visited Hollywood and appeared in January 1936 on the Music Variety Show, but she admitted to feeling intimidated by her brother's reputation. During their partnership, Fred, whose perfectionism earned him the nickname "Moaning Minnie" from her, had always been the dominant creative force. In 1937 Adele began filming in England with Jack Buchanan and Maurice Chevalier, but withdrew after two days. She later recalled: "Oh boy, if my brother Fred sees this--I'm gone". There is no known film record of Adele performing (aside from a clip lasting a few seconds), but she made eight recordings, all duets with Fred. Unlike her brother, Adele was extremely gregarious and took great delight in shocking friends and strangers alike. Adele Astaire died of a stroke in Tucson, Arizona, aged 84.
Built in 1905, the Gottlieb Storz Mansion in Omaha includes the "Adele and Fred Astaire Ballroom" on the top floor, which is the only memorial to their Omaha roots.

For the past year, we've been saying that the retail sector is in trouble, and that the potential impact of Amazonification and the retailpocalypse will be felt in other sectors.
Our primary concern is that as big box retailers often support local newspaper through ads. So that as an expected 2,500 retail locations shut down through early 2019, there will also be a cut in ad buys in local newspapers.
And that may lead to local newspapers either laying off staff, shifting from a daily to a weekly, or from a weekly to twice-a-month, or shutting down completely.
That could lead to an increase in what are being called new deserts -- communities that don't have access to local news.
All of that has an impact on PR and marketing because there would be fewer outlets with which to reach key audiences.
But we've also been concerned that the number of store closings will also impact real estate, both at malls and in towns. At malls, we've felt the problem is that if an anchor location remains empty, the entire mail will be written off by consumers. And that precipitates more closings, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy that leads to a downward spiral.
In a Bloomberg News article yesterday that was syndicated into a number of papers, including the Boston Globe, "Struggling malls at crossroads as Sears makes exit," reporters Patrick Clark and Justina Vasquez made that same point:
"As Sears shutters stores, landlords will have to overcome the perception that the entire property is failing or risk losing other tenants, said Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resource Group, a retail-advisory firm."
“You’re going to see an epic hollowing out of the retail malls in America, especially the malls that are co-anchored by Sears” and another struggling large retailer, Flickinger said. “It’s creating an accelerating retail ice age and an economic Armageddon of unprecedented proportions in the US.”
Retail is an important sector for the U.S., and not just to buy things. Retail can a communal activity whereas shopping online is not. And Bloomberg has reported on the negative impact on local towns in the U.K., when shops have closed on main street, and residents then have to drive thirty minutes or more to buy things they once could in their home town. Those towns suffer because there's literarily nothing holding people there.
So, a lot of doom and gloom -- and you don't have to be a big shopper to see that this can affect you. We don't necessarily have a solution. But we feel that raising the issue is important, that discussing this can help lead to awareness. If we ignore the retailopaclypse, it's not going to go away.

A story is told about Rav Elazar Shach zt”l, who was once asked if women should learn CPR so that they can respond and act in a situation in which a child would need it. Rav Shach said not to learn it, because Hashem does not put a person in a situation that he cannot deal with. If they were to know CPR, new situations would occur where they would, chas veshalom, have to administer it.1
No is only a 2 letter word, but it can be so hard to say sometimes, especially when you are a teacher!
We've all been there, sometimes you are in your classroom busily getting things done during your prep when your principal, fellow teacher, or parent pops their head in and says, "Can I ask you a favor?
Sometimes, of course we are happy to say, "yes". The favor is something we want to do, is rewarding, or a win-win situation. But other times, we feel anything but excited about the situation. We feel obligated, pressured, resentful, and even guilty for wanting to say, "no".
Teachers are natural overachievers. We are the perfectionists who want to do it all and then some! Couple that with our urge to be care-givers and you have a recipe for not being able to say the word no. Unfortunately, that can lead to burn-out and frustration!
I have learned that saying no not only helps me to be a happier and healthier person, but it also gives me more time and energy to focus on my students and instruction. Win-win, right?
Maybe your principal asks you to serve on "just one more committee" or a parent asks you to pull together work for a week for their student while they go on vacation starting tomorrow. Sometimes, you just need to say, no you simply can't!
"Thank you for considering me for the Sunshine Committee, but I really need to focus on improving my math instruction this quarter."
"I would love to put work together for Johnny, but unfortunately it is impossible to do that with such short notice. I will have his missing work available for him when he returns to school."
"I can't serve on the committee, but I know that Ms. Smith has a lot of great staff morale building ideas!"
Let them know that your not saying no because of them personally, but it is just your own personal boundary.
"I'm sorry, It's my policy to have students make up work when they return to school so that I can offer instruction and support if they need it."
Your principal might ask you to take the lead on a project that sounds interesting, but you just can't take on another thing at this time.
"I would love to implement XYZ in my classroom, but I am swamped with report cards right now. Can I start that next quarter?"
Let's say your principal is asking you to do several tasks at once, or is adding additional things to your already overflowing plate. Turn question back over to them.
"I would absolutely love to do X, Y, and Z, but I am going to need additional time to do them. How would you like me to prioritize them?"
According to reports from the Canadian Jewish News, Unifor, Canada's largest private-sector union, adopted a BDS motion at its convention two weeks ago.
Lawrence DAVIDSON: "BDS, human rights and the Jews" (Redress Information & Analysis, July 30, 2017): click here!
As of July 2017, the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israeli racism and apartheid is 12 years old. This means that over the last dozen years a worldwide grassroots movement has grown up – a movement of civil society – that has organised active opposition to Zionist racism and Israeli oppression.
The California Democratic Party has approved a resolution calling on the US government to promote “a just peace based on full equality and security for Israeli Jews and Palestinians alike, human rights and international law.”

Between two business appointments, before returning to the hotel, you have finally managed to get an hour of free time… Here’s our quick guide to Paris, specifically for the traveller in a rush, to be sure you get the most out of your express visit to the ‘City of Light’.
To take in the sight of one of the best views of Paris – and thus the world – while enjoying a well-earned cocktail after a long day of work, head to the Tour Montparnasse. This unattractive tower features an aptly-named restaurant on its top floor: Le Ciel de Paris.
Simple, hearty food, focusing on the quality of the products and not on anything fancy, has found acclaim in the French capital in recent years. And the timing is perfect, because you can find the true heart and soul of Paris in its brasseries. New establishments are popping up to the delight of every Parisian generation, including young people, who are showing a true passion for this popular style of food “Made in France”, of which they are proud.
To be immersed in the heart of the spirit of Paris’s people, go to the Brasserie Lipp in the Saint Germain des Prés quarter. A true Parisian institution, this establishment has been open for 135 years and has welcomed everyone who is anyone in Paris throughout its life: from Saint Exupéry to Madonna, Lipp was and still is the typical Parision meeting spot for artists and intellectuals from all backgrounds.
When it comes to Paris, you can tell people about the Seine, which flows quietly in the heart of the Ile Saint Louis, the always lively terraces that waft aromas of coffee, croissants, or even beef bourguignon, the hustle-and-bustle of the Avenue des Champs Elysées…
Trust in the mighty power of your sense of smell to condense the ambient elegance and share it with your loved ones: the delicacy of a typical Parisian brand of perfume seems to be the most glamorous and romantic choice.
Last week my family and I set out on our longest road trip to date. Minneapolis, MN to Bloomington, IN. I can’t believe I didn’t discuss road trips in my earlier blogs . . . isn’t this the season dedicated to hours in the car eating junk food, listening to the radio and counting cows?! I feel like it’s a rite of passage for every American child, and mine were totally up for the challenge.
Backing out of the driveway, my hubby had ‘Holiday Road’ blaring from the speakers (all great road trips must pay homage to Nat’l Lampoons Vacation, whether Aunt Edna is with you or not) and both boys were armed with their favorite movies, headphones and snacks for days. I planned to use these hours to catch up on email, sort through photos on my phone and make sure our family calendar was on point when we returned. But, as always, motion sickness set in half way through my first email and in lieu of being productive, I counted cows.
I feel like when we travel, we throw all rules out the windows. Bed times, nutrition, screen time, all take a back seat to accommodate the road trippin’ timeline. So, when we made our first stop in Chicago, already past the boy’s bedtime, it was fitting that we entered the lobby of the hotel to some serious bass, dark lights and a bar full of 20-somethings in their finest “I’m looking for a date” fashions. The lobby bar was a total club scene and there I stood with my family, covered in chip crumbs, ice cream spills and backpacks full of stuffed animals and dinosaurs. (Parenthood sure does change a Saturday night.) We definitely cramped the cool-kids weekend vibes and found immediate refuge up a few levels in our room. My kids were thrilled to be up way past their bed time, ordering pizza in bed and watching the Olympics. And if that wasn’t good enough, just like in a movie, outside our huge picture window, over-looking Lake Michigan, a fireworks show erupted right in front of us and for the first time in 8 hours, we were all silent, staring out the window. What a treat!! I could get used to this. But all good things must come to an end and all good kids must hit the hay (as my dad would say), lights were soon out and we were all happily in bed.
The next day, we had breakfast in bed, went swimming in the rooftop pool and took the boys on the Navy Pier ferris wheel before packing back up. Next stop: Bloomington, IN. The home of Indiana University, my husband’s Alma Mater. He’s a third generation Hoosier and couldn’t be more proud. By the time we arrived on campus, he was already plotting out what fraternity our boys would pledge, where they will live on campus and how to get the best seats at Assembly Hall for a little IU Bball. (Side note: I really love his love of his school, but grooming our boys this early in life is just not fair to me and my hometown University of MN Golden Gopher pride. Not to mention, I’ll never stop crying if my boys move that far away from me. A counter plan to keep my boys in MN begins now . . . I’ll keep you posted on the progress.) We quickly jumped out of the car and did a walking tour through campus. Even though IU is a rival Big Ten school to my U o MN, I have to admit, that campus is beautiful!!! After a dinner at one of his favorite restaurants, my husband took the boys to the book store to load up on all things Hoosier red and white. Outfits, posters, stuffed animals (are you kidding me?? This is too much), my boys emerged from the store looking like the newest freshman recruits. We checked IU off our road trip list and got to bed, the next day we were taking off for destination number three.
Lake Wawasee, in Syracuse, IN is where my husband spent every summer of his childhood. Leaving IU and driving north to Lake Wawasee, my boys were already in their swim trunks, sunscreen on, ready to dive into the water as soon as we arrived. Pulling into the cottage my husband spent weeks at as a kid, we made this insanely long road trip, worth every minute. The lake is clear and clean, there are boats and jet skis and toys for everyone. And the cottage is a perfect setting to enjoy the final few days of summer.
My oldest, William, has a brand new Go Pro that he proudly wore as he jumped in the lake and sped around on the jet ski. James, our baby (fine. He’s almost 5, but will always be my baby) worked up the courage to make the giant lily pad his stomping grounds. We swam, boated, ate and repeated for 36 hours! It was mostly marvelous, with just a few minor meltdowns. I mean no family of four can go 36 hours without a few meltdowns over whose turn it is anyway and who was really responsible for dropping the brand new Go Pro and letting it sink to the bottom of the lake . . . right? Right. Other than a few minor mishaps, we returned each night to the cottage a brand new shade of tan (even though we wear a lot of sunscreen) and a whole new level of exhausted.
It was bittersweet packing up for our final voyage, not only because I simply adore time with my three boys, but also because Syracuse, IN to Minneapolis, MN is no joke. About 10 hours, with stops and a nasty rain storm, to get back to home sweet home. But on our way home, there was definitely a sense of pride from all four of us. The kids were thrilled with the new adventures and are already plotting ways to permanently eat breakfast in bed. My husband was beaming with pride that his family had a blast in his favorite state. And I, to be real honest, am thrilled that I was able to keep this family unit in one piece, without massive meltdown for a total of 1000+ miles across the Midwest. Phew.
So, ICC announces the groups for the 2015 Cricket world Cup to be held in Australia and New Zealand. (more…)
That was a clinical performance from the England side today against Australia at Edgbaston. England choose to bat after winning the toss. England openers had slow start as they lost their captain early for a low score. Bell and Trott steadied the ship with useful partnership as they reached the half way stage, at one point of time they were looking good at 170-1 from 30 overs and were aiming at 300. But thing didn’t go well for them as kept loosing wickets at crucial times, at the end they managed to get only 270 runs on the board from their 50 overs. Competitive score with 30 runs short from England’s point of view. Australians were happy as they restricted them for a lesser score, thanks to their bowlers who came to the party at the right time of the innings. Australia started their innings with the most destructive openers in world cricket and were hoping for a good start to follow a desperate win against the English men to get some confidence going before the much awaited Ashes series and to get going forward in champions trophy.
Watson and Warner played a watchful innings this time but that proved costly as they fell in wrong time that too in a quick succession. Hughes and Bailey tried to consolidate the innings with a partnership as Hughes played some delightful cover drives for fours and kept the score board going, Bailey took the responsibility to play till the end to get over the line for his team, they were looking good even when they run rate was increasing all the time. Tredwell who replaced the big boots of Swann got rid of Hughes with a quicker delivery that nipped back in at no time caught Hughes in front of the stumps. Australia had a lot of batting to come though but the decisive moment came when Anderson took the ball and knocked out Mitchelle Marsh and Mathew Wade in one over leaving Bailey the lonely Aussie at the ground. This rapped up the match for England as there was nothing much batting to come though the Aussie tail enders were no mugs with their bats, Bailey felt after very quickly and Faulkner showed some resistence at the end to make sure that batted through the 50 overs without getting allout and he was successful in doing this as Australia ended their innings at 221/9 in thier 50 overs of quota.
Ian Bell of England named Man Of the Match for his 91 runs of 115 balls who helped England to reach that score.
Fixing is not a new word in the world of sports. Accepting huge amounts of money, expensive accessories, and gifts from match fixers (bookies) to perform poorly which leads to their team’s defeat is regarded as fixing in Sports. Commitment towards nation, towards people who believe them to be their super heroes, who believe that these sportsmen will make them proud by winning, that belief that commitment that feeling disappears, nullifies because of fixing.
What makes life even more beautiful, exciting is its unpredictability. We never know what’s in stake for us the next moment. Fixing in sports takes away that excitement. Fixing in sports is like fooling people. Cheating millions of people just for money is a no good thing. But why do they do that, why the money, the wealth becomes more than respect towards nation, love they get from the people. Well there are some reasons.
We are living in the 21st century where money and only money is most important. Desire to be rich is not wrong but taking shortcuts to achieve what u want, to fulfill your desires is certainly wrong. People who fall prey to match fixing are basically the one who want to be rich overnight. Values morals doesn’t matter, the only things that they think about is being rich and hence involve in match fixing.
Cricket being an obsession in our country is certainly the most talked about sport. Over the past decade, Indian cricket has been rocked by scandals related to match fixing. What is significant here is that most of the cricket match-fixing scandals that have occurred in the last decade have had to do with the Indian subcontinent. In the year 2000, the whole nation was startled to hear the names of well known cricketers like Salim Malik, Mohammad Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja and Manoj Prabhakar’s involvement in match fixing. While Ajay Jadeja faced a ban from cricket for five years, Manoj Prabhakar was disqualified from holding any post in the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India), and Azharuddin, Malik were awarded life time banishment from cricket. It’s not only our cricketers but also crickets from countries like Pakistan, South Africa, and Sri Lanka, Australia have been involved in fixing scandals.
Latest fixing scandal is IPL. With several players already being punished, we can expect many more shocks. So there is a need to curb, stop this match fixing, and make the sport pure in all aspects. The era when we had Sachin, Ganguly, Dravid, Laxman was the golden era for Indian cricket. There is no dearth of talent in our country, but sportsmen need to get inspired from our cricketing greats, follow their values, and learn from them.
Self realization is important. Young cricketers need to realize the importance of commitment towards the people who believe them and the nation. They must understand the fact that money is not everything. Respect is what matters.”Let your conscience be your guide”.
Betting in our country is Illegal. But in the UK, where sport betting is regulated and a thriving industry, there are rare instances of player involvement in match fixing or even scandals of this nature. To tackle the problem, experts have suggested that legalization and regulation of gambling is probably the best solution. Banning is not going to help, as it will only motivate the industry to operate underground, as is the case with India, where the illegal gambling industry is worth almost 2,000 crore rupees. However, the public should demand solutions to match fixing.
Law makers of our country are very keen to bring out new a law which strictly punishes the people who indulge in match fixing. As viewers all we can do is hope.

On Saturday, the Sherwood Park Crusaders will hand out their player awards for the 17/18 season, so here at BTI we decided to take a stab at our own version of the awards:
It’s really unfortunate that Readman missed those 11 games due to injury; I truly believe he would’ve lead the entire AJHL in points he hadn’t. He has played the fewest games out of the Top-20 scorers in the league and currently sits in 13th with 64 points. Readman also leads the league in powerplay assists with 23. The Northern Michigan commit is the best player on the Crusaders, you could make the argument that he is the best player in the AJHL. Ty Readman is my pick for MVP.
There are honestly three or four different players who could be considered most valuable to this team, which speaks to their depth. But you have to score goals to win, and no one produced more than Dylan Stewart. The big forward could play on the wing or down the middle and still produce. His 65 points tied for the team lead and for 10th in the AJHL. He was consistent and clutch and he’s my pick for MVP.
Without Ben McLeod, the Crusaders defence would be shaky at best. The veteran defenceman brings a hard-hitting style to the lineup and this year he’s been able to develop his offensive side, hitting career highs in all offensive categories. When McLeod is on the sidelines his absence is well known. He’s also been a great mentor for the Crusaders young defenceman like Michael Bentz, Aiden Yakimchuk, and Payton McIsaac. He may have missed a good chunk of games this season but McLeod is still my pick for the defenceman of the year.
There’s lots to like about Kallis. He plays a calm game that allows him to have success with younger, inexperienced partners. Not only is he solid in his own end, but he can move the puck up the ice efficiently and holds his own in the offensive end. Don’t forget that he didn’t miss a single game this season either. Kallis was Mr. Reliable for this year’s Crusaders d-core.
Sometimes you forget that Brandon Vogel is only a rookie. He’s seen a lot of starts this season due to injuries, WHL call-ups, and also great performances. There has been a number of times this year that Vogel has stolen games for this Crusaders team. Vogel has played more than any other rookie goaltender in the league, and while his numbers may not be the greatest, they don’t reflect how well he has played this season. The Crusaders have set themselves up nicely for years to come with him between the pipes.
Zapernick finished fourth in team scoring and was a versatile piece for the Cru. Not only did he see a little time on the powerplay, he also chipped in two shorthanded points. I was very impressed with the 16-year-old Edmonton product.
Michael Bentz has come a long way since the start of the regular season. You can see he plays which much more confidence now and has become one of the Crusaders most reliable defencemen. He constantly has head down the ice and looks to spring his teammates on breakaways often. Bentz has also become a hard-nosed player and will stick up for himself and his teammate no matter the opposition. I am really looking forward to watching him develop even more next season.
The season isn’t quite over yet, and Wallis has already doubled his point total. This year he’s proven that not only can he contribute to the teams bottom six, but he can slide up the lineup and has the ability to play with the teams more skilled players. I was pleasantly surprised with Wallis’ growth this season.
On November 1st, the Sherwood Park Crusaders squired Ryan Cox from the Fort McMurray Oil Barons in exchange for Merritt Oszytko. He came into the organization a filled a massive hole for this team: a true goal scorer. Since joining the Cru, Cox has 52 points in 41 games which includes 29 goals with four being game winners. The addition of Cox has to be one of the best trades made across the league this season.
The Cru scored two goals in the final ten minutes which set the stage for Dylan Stewart’s overtime winner. The win was Sherwood Parks second in a row and sparked a 6-2-0 run that saw them lose a pair of close games to Spruce Grove and Fort MacMurray. That run was the most confident I saw the team all year, and it was all sparked by the comeback win against the Pontiacs.

Got up by six and for breakfast finished the rye and mustard. Rode to the station, sent my bike, and bought a 4th-class ticket. It left at eight. The car was like a box car divided into three parts with wooden benches around the walls. It was packed. From Rostock to Sassnitz, 85 miles, the train made 25 stops. At Stralsund there was an hour-and-forty-minute wait to change trains. I walked about the town and got some lunch.
At the edge of town the second train ran on a boat and thus we crossed a mile of water to Rügens. It was just like a picnic. The people got on, rode a couple of stations, and then got off. They would not sit down, but had to stand around and hang their heads out of the windows. One husband kept pointing out familiar landmarks to his wife and all she would say was Ach nay in an awed voice. The train poked along from 15 to 35 per and at the larger places stopped long enough for those who wished to get off and have a beer. When time to go, the conductor would blow a little whistle and off we would go for a couple miles more. It was really quite a social event of the season with tables all over the platforms, etc. After nearly five hours, exclusive of the change, we rolled into Sassnitz, a small place with several hotels. Here I left all my stuff except the camera, diary, toothbrush, comb, and slicker. Guess my bike is at the RR depot.
After buying a loaf of raisin bread, I went aboard the boat. It takes a Stockholm train over to Trälleborg, Sweden. As we left the island, it was very beautiful, the hills and high white cliffs. The sunset over the calm blue sea and the cliffs turning purple in the distance. Our boat was a very good one in every way. Made the trip in four hours and landed at 8:30PM after dark. I took the train to Malmö. It was a fast one and we were there by 9:30. Then began the long hunt for a reasonable hotel, which only ended after I had walked from one end of town and back again. Took a nice room in the Central Hotel for 3 Kronas, down from 3.50 K. The woman who runs it used to be a governess in New York and Boston. I asked her for something to put on my bread and she brought me two poached eggs, a pitcher of milk, and lots of butter. I really eat after all. Gee, it’s cold here.

Donald Victor Taylor (30 June 1936 – 11 November 2003; usually credited as Don Taylor) was a writer, producer, and director, notable his work with BBC television and BBC radio.
Born in Marylebone in London, Taylor attended Chiswick Grammar School and subsequently studied English Literature at Pembroke College, Oxford. While at university he became actively involved in student theatre, particularly with the Experimental Theatre Club. It was for the club that Taylor directed, in 1957, the world premiere of Epitaph for George Dillon by the acclaimed playwright John Osborne. In 1960, he married writer Ellen Dryden, and they had two children. He died of colon cancer in 2003, at the age of 67.
In 1990, Taylor retired from television. He and his wife established a radio production company called First Writes, producing plays independently for transmission on BBC radio. He both wrote and directed for radio himself, as well as assisting his wife with the running of a young person's theatre company she had established near their Chiswick home based in Don's own school. He wrote a number of plays for the company, including "The Daughters of Venice".
In 2004, the BBC aired several radio plays in tribute to Taylor. This was followed in 2008 by a "Don Taylor Season" on BBC Radio 7.

Throughout September, we met with hundreds of concerned residents along the path of the proposed Mountain Valley Pipeline in places such as Summers and Monroe Counties in West Virginia and Roanoke and Montgomery Counties in Virginia. The pipeline would carry natural gas from fracking operations in West Virginia for 301 miles, crossing through public lands, private properties and more than 1,000 waterways.
At the meetings, which were held along with the Sierra Club Virginia Chapter and the Protect Our Water Heritage and Rights coalition and their local member organizations, we discussed the pipeline’s timeline and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s permitting process, as well as current and upcoming opportunities for public comment. We also reviewed county-specific threats including water quality, vulnerable karst geology, property rights and community safety.
In mid-September, federal regulators released the draft environmental impact statement for the Mountain Valley Pipeline. The draft fails to adequately assess the public need for the project — a recent report shows that existing infrastructure could meet demand until 2030. The federal review also discounts the widespread threats to private property, public lands, local communities, water quality and the climate. Read more about the pipelines here.
“Running a massive gas project through the steep, rugged terrain laced with dozens of rivers and headwater streams is a perfect storm for major damage to our water resources,” says Lara Mack, Virginia Campaign Field Organizer with Appalachian Voices. “FERC also fails to meaningfully address the safety issues and other concerns so earnestly voiced by hundreds of homeowners and landowners along the route.”
Public comments on the MVP draft environmental impact statement are due Dec. 22. To submit a comment, visit appvoices.org/fight-mvp
This is the 4th Edition, published in 2007, so it’s pretty up to date. It’s a treatise on marketing for small businesses and individuals, the breadth of which is kind of astonishing. It’s been around for a long time and Levinson has since built a whole infrastructure of co-authored books on more specialized marketing topics. But this is the one that started it all, the one that forms the basis for all of those other ones, and, I’m betting, the one that mentions his other books the most. It’s clear that he has applied most of what he espouses to a high degree of success.
I needed this book. I’m at a point in my business where I need to have my marketing strategy in the front of my mind at every moment. It needs to roll off my tongue like a downhill putt at Augusta, if you know what I mean. Levinson gets the business owner pretty far down the road on this pursuit, but he doesn’t stop there. He spends a little more time on saving money and doing market research, then launches into a detailed discussion of all of the different types of marketing and advertising know to humankind. He groups them as (1) Minimedia (like business cards), (2) Maximedia (like TV), and (3) New Media (like e-mail and blogs).
It’s pretty comprehensive and he goes into a fair amount of minutia on each. He had an interesting digression on classified advertising and talked fondly about the $500/month he earned for about a dozen years selling his self-published book Secrets of Successful Free-Lancing (pg 137). He sold it only via classified ads and uses it to illustrate how lethal and simple classified advertising can be if you monitor your response rates.
He spends a fair amount of time on direct mail (that’s maximedia), going into detail on the style of the envelope, the color of the paper used, and the content of the mailer. He goes through it all man, I’m telling you.
I got a lot out of these three segments, but I also blew through a lot of it very quickly. Radio and TV advertising are not in the cards for me so I couldn’t stay focused on topics like these.
He finishes up the book with three chapters on the “nature of the guerrilla.” In this section he goes into the attributes and attitudes of the marketing guerrilla. It is motivating and some good stuff, but I think the Gitomer books cover a lot of this stuff and I like reading them a lot better. I’ve slapped together some notes on Guerilla Marketing that I’ll use them a lot as I hammer through my marketing strategy over the next 60 days, but I have a feeling that I’m going to be spending more of my time in the Gitomer books than in Guerilla Marketing.
This was a good read and brought a lot of stuff to mind, it’s going in the stack of books at my office that I’m going to be referring to in the near future.
I'm John Steffen and I write stuff here. I can't help myself. Be thankful I'm not clogging up your Facebook timeline with this junk. Reach me @jstefdotcom.

We’re killing our first pig today. Having raised him from a small piglet, back in May, today is the day we complete the reason why we got him.
It seems to me to be fairly natural, especially as this is our first, to take a few moments to consider whether this is the right things for us; can we justify killing another animal so we can eat, and should we, in fact, be vegetarians?
We both enjoy eating and cooking meat, and certainly wouldn’t consider having a pig as a pet. But somehow it feels different now; eating meat from the supermarket, where you have no sight of the original animal, seems a lot easier than doing the deed to an animal you have raised, nurtured, shown how to use a wallow, rubbed sun-cream into his ears when it’s hot, fed, watered, and generally ensured he had a happy life.
We’ve made the decision that we are going to eat meat, and we want our meat to come from an animal that has led as natural a life as we are able to manage. Out of respect for the life that was given we will endeavour to make use of every part of Richard that we can. It’s with a sombre mood that we begin preparation for the day. It’s not an easy decision for us, eating our own livestock, but it’s better than buying from the supermarket.
I’m not going to post pictures of the kill; if you want to see a pig being butchered, we’ve already done that last year, so here is a celebration of the life of our food for the next year. The next few days will be spent butchering, curing and storing the meat, and we’ll post how we got on when we’re finished!
I understand your reluctance and consideration on this, especially as you have ‘brought him up’ from a tiny piglet. I too eat and enjoy meat, so it would be hypocritical of me to condemn what you are doing, but I will be interested in your reaction during and after ‘the kill’. I take it you get a ‘pro’ in to do the deed?
Hi Sally, now that it’s done I can definitely say that the run -up to the kill was the worst part for us. We were both anxious that his death should be as clean, painless and stress-free as possible for him. Once he was dead it was a different; we both agree that we no longer considered him to be the pig we knew, but was now simply meat, to be saved and processed as quickly as possible. So looking back I can say that the worry that he would feel pain or distress was the hardest part for us. Thankfully Stefan, the village gunman, is a true professional and always ensures a clean kill.

"Looking Back, Looking Ahead: Anthropologists Reflect on the Struggle for Boycott and a Half-Century of Israeli Occupation"(Anthropologists for the Boycott of Israeli Academic Institutions, June 5, 2017): click here!
June 2017 marks fifty years since the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, a watershed event that consolidated and extended the 1948 ethnic cleansing of Palestine. After a half century of deepening colonization and apartheid, the “two state solution” that has long been proposed as a way to resolve the conflict appears more elusive than ever.
A senior Israeli official serving in the United States didn’t even attempt to evade the truth. It’s true, he told me – we have been greatly exaggerating the issue of the boycott. It’s a marginal, insignificant phenomenon.
As Palestinians mark a number of key, painful anniversaries in 2017, Israel is busy with not ending the occupation, but entrenching it and crying wolf claiming to be the victim in the decades-old conflict.
Today, the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), representing close to one million workers, endorsed a full boycott of Israel to achieve Palestinian rights under international law. LO is the largest and most influential umbrella organization of labor unions in Norway.
Throughout the month of May, members of the Modern Language Association, the largest professional society of humanities scholars in the United States, will be voting on a resolution which—in contrast to other scholarly associations—seeks to ban the association from endorsing of the Palestinian call for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions.
Key Israel lobby groups have conceded that they have failed to counter the Palestine solidarity movement, despite vastly increasing their spending. The admission is contained in a secret report that The Electronic Intifada has obtained.
Asa WINSTANLEY: "BDS is winning, admits top Israeli “sabotage” strategist" (EI, April 21, 2017): click here!
The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement against Israel is winning, a top anti-BDS strategist has conceded. At the “Ambassadors Against BDS” conference in New York last month, former Israeli government advisor Gidi Grinstein said that “in 2016 our community probably invested 20 times … more resources in dealing with this problem compared to what we invested in 2010.”
Barcelona city council passed a historic declaration on Wednesday upholding the right to boycott Israel over its violations of Palestinian rights. The motion condemns Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land, calls for the immediate end to the decade-long Gaza blockade and ensures that the city’s public procurement policies exclude companies that profit from Israel’s human rights abuses.
"Historic Decision: Barcelona City Council Votes to End Complicity with Israeli Occupation & Illegal Settlements" (BDS Movement, April 19, 2017): click here!
Today, in light of the Barcelona City Council’s vote to condemn Israel’s occupation, call to end complicity in Israel’s violations of international law, and affirmation of the legitimacy of the Palestinian-led Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement for Palestinian human rights, the Palestinian BDS National Committee (BNC) released the following statement:
How can we distinguish between the very real and harmful phenomenon of antisemitism, and false accusations of antisemitism used to defend Israeli state policies ? Jewish Voice for Peace, a grassroots organization working for justice and equality in Palestine and Israel, has put together a collection of essays on this question.
A new UN report offers explicit backing for the Palestinian-led boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign to end Israeli apartheid and support a just peace. The landmark report’s endorsement of boycotts, economic sanctions and other grassroots initiatives comes at a moment when Israel is desperately attempting to criminalize and suppress international support for Palestinian rights.
The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has just forwarded its questions to the French government, following the appeal filed by the 11 activists who were convicted after their public call to boycott products imported from Israel.

Martin Asbaek Gallery, Copenhagen talks to Foam about their participation in the international photography fair, Unseen, taking place in Amsterdam in September.
It's hard to say. I don't think that Danish photography has any special features. Danish photography is highly international. Which isn't so surprising since many of our photographers are educated at various schools abroad. These four artists that we will represent at UNSEEN, Astrid Kruse Jensen, Trine Søndergaard, Nicolai Howalt and Ebbe Stub Wittrup come from four different schools in Europe; Prague, The Netherlands, Scotland and from Fatamorgana - The Danish School of Art Photography in Copenhagen, Denmark. But the common feature of these four artists is an intense and precise aesthetic awareness. They work with thoroughly planned concepts and whole thematic series.
Trine Søndergaard's (b. 1972) work ranges from documentary and diary sketches to conceptual photography. In recent years she has focused primarily on the landscape and portrait. Søndergaard is also working closely with the Danish artist Nicolai Howalt (b. 1970). They are known for the series How to Hunt, that describe the interplay of man, nature and animal. They are currently at work on a new common project that we will present at UNSEEN. Nicolai Howalt's work has documentary references, operating at the intersection of conceptual photography and installation.
The third artist Astrid Kruse Jensen explores in her work the borderland between the apparent and the hidden, between the real and imaginary
And finally the fourth Danish artist Ebbe Stub Wittrup, who has focused on the photographic medium since the end of the 1990s. His photographs, whether we look at his neorealistic snapshots or the more conceptually oriented photo series, display a mysteriousness that makes one think of a series of narrative parallel worlds.
They are in total four of the best and well established Danish photographers at the moment. They have all exhibited nationally and internationally at museums and galleries, and are all represented in several private as well as public collections.
3.There is limited space for each gallery at the fair so how will you choose which works get presented?
We are in that lucky situation that all the artists are currently working on new thematic series, so we have the chance to present four new projects for the photo fair. We work very closely with the artist when we select the works for the fairs. The artistic idiom of the group presentation at the upcoming fair will be as enigmatic and poetic as a Nordic landscape. It will be a truly Scandinavian presentation where the artists investigate the ambivalent space between reality and imagination.
4.You have an art advisory firm as well as a gallery. What are your key tips for those wanting to collect photography?
MAG doesn't have an advisory firm. Asbæk Art Consulting is an independent company founded and managed by Thomas and Patricia Asbæk, Martin Asbæk's brother and mother. An Art Advisory firm works on other premises and has a completely different structure than the gallery business.
But if we asked them for some general advice I have no doubt they would say: 1. Buy with your heart and use your head. 2. See as much art as you can - it's ultimately all about looking, re-looking and then look again. 3. Don't be afraid to contact an art advisor.
The contemporary art market including photography (since there is no real distinction between the two) is very hard to predict. But an art advisor has the sensibility and experience to distinguishing between A-list pieces and B-list pieces and it will always be the A-listers that define an artist or a period in art. And then remember that good art is always a personal investment - also in the future.
We have facilitated distribution of all the data from GOLD through the excel files in order to support scientists around the world who would like to get the data and perform their own analysis and eventually publish their results. We intent to continue supporting this sort of usage by providing all the data through an excel file. However, we have recently noticed an increasing number of cases where colleagues were downloading the data in order to feed the development of systems replicating GOLD's functionality. We are putting tremendous amount of effort to collect and curate the metadata for an increasing number of genomes and metagenomes. Funding for curation of biological data is very limited if at all available, therefore we cannot support funding of other systems based on the manual work we do. Accordingly, if you need the data in order to perform comparative analysis, leading to publication or even populate other dbases you may have we are happy to continue providing you the GOLD data through excel.

Financial crimes are investigated and prosecuted by both the state and federal government. At any one time, and depending on the degree of perceived impact, the government may be more or less focused on particular types of financial criminal activity. During the mortgage and housing crisis, investigators nationwide turned their attention to investigations of banks, mortgage brokers, and in some cases, borrowers. The past decade has also demonstrated the government’s increased attention to investigations of securities fraud, computer intrusion and theft, campaign finance fraud, international money laundering, and violation of export regulations.

Although the company did raise the minimum wage for all of its employees earlier this month, it’s plowing ahead on warehouse robotics and automation in a way that could fundamentally reshape how its lowest-paid employees perform work — and how many of those employees it needs to retain. Amazon now uses more than 100,000 robots in warehouses around the world to help move and organize products, according to The New York Times, and it also sponsors an annual robotics competition to help spur innovation in AI that could result in more dexterous and intelligent robots capable of performing complex physical tasks.
Shortly after the first Kindle launched, Amazon premiered its Kindle Direct Publishing platform to let authors self-publish and sell books on Amazon.

Amazon now oversees tens of millions of self-published works on its platform and nearly two dozen imprints. In 2017, Amazon had more than 83 percent of all US ebook sales.
But one of the biggest differences between Cyber Monday and Black Friday remains: the style of shopping, says Vice President of PR and Events at Slickdeals, Regina Conway. “For example, we see more sitewide discounts or category-wide discounts on Cyber Monday, whereas Black Friday will often have very specific products such as electronics and home goods at deep, deep discounts,” she says. “However, more merchants have started advertising specific product deals on Cyber Monday and vice versa, so the holidays are starting to have more crossover.”

Jumana AL TAMIMI: "Boycott move buoyed by UN resolution" (Gulf News Palestine, Dec 26, 2016): click here!
The international movement to boycott Israel business and sanction those who do business with the state has been given a huge shot in the arm by the passing on Friday night of an unprecedented United Nations Security Council resolution.
Palestinians welcome statement as “a major blow to Israel’s repressive legal war” on the BDS movement: Renowned legal scholars and lawyers from 15 European countries consider BDS as “a lawful exercise of freedom of expression”. Palestinian BDS human rights defenders welcome the statement as a “defining moment” in asserting their right to boycott Israel to realize Palestinian rights

May BULMAN: "EU declares right to boycott Israel is protected by free speech" (Independent, Nov 3, 2016): click here!
The European Union’s foreign policy chief has affirmed the right of EU citizens to boycott Israel, but said the EU remains opposed to a boycott on the country.
“The EU stands firm in protecting freedom of expression and freedom of association in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is applicable on EU member states’ territory, including with regard to BDS [boycott, divestment and sanctions] actions carried out on this territory,” Federica Mogherini told the European Parliament in answer to a written question in late September.
Charlotte SILVER: "Israel lobby lawsuits aim to slow boycott in Spain" (The Electronic Intifada, Oct 27, 2016): click here!
In July 2014, at the height of Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, Spain’s RESCOP launched a national campaign targeting local cultural institutions, businesses and associations, asking that they declare themselves “free of Israeli apartheid.” That effort has since grown, in both size and kind. Today, there are more than 50 participating cities and towns across the country.
Ali ABUNIMAH: "Boycotting “the occupation” is not enough" (The Electronic Intifada, Oct 21, 2016): click here!
Earlier this month, The New York Review of Books published a call for “a targeted boycott of all goods and services from all Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, and any investments that promote the occupation, until such time as a peace settlement is negotiated between the Israeli government and the Palestinian Authority.”
"Public figures call-out 'moral inconsistency' of boycotting Israeli settlements alone" (BDS, Oct 21, 2016): click here!
A statement recently published in The New York Review of Books calls for “an Economic Boycott and Political Nonrecognition of the Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Territories” [Letters, October 13]. We welcome the statement’s shattering of the taboo against boycotting Israeli entities that are complicit in — at least selective — violations of Palestinian human rights.
2005 125 SM 2005 MZ 125 SM In 1907, a German company known as Dampf-Fraft-Wagen, or DKW, started out by producing engines for bicycles. In the 1920s, DKW began producing 2-stroke engines for motorcycles, and their designs went on to dominate all forms of motorcycle racing from 1922 ไปยัง 1936, winning 45 championships. ใน 1956, DKW changed its name to Motorradwerk Zschopau, or MZ. Due to wartime conditions, MZ continued to produce engines and bikes in East Germany, but it was eventually purchased by Hong Leong Group out of Malaysia. The MZ 125 was introduced in 2002, and the 2005 version offers the same high quality and dependable performance we have come to expect from MZ. While there are ...

The following is a press release from California Scholars for Academic Freedom (CS4AF), a group of over 200 scholars at twenty California institutions of higher learning, urging a renewed and strong support by university administrators for academic freedom and the right to free speech and dissent in light of the alarming recent history of assaults on academic freedom, including a list of over 20 such assaults:

Monday 26th September 2016, about 20 activists protested against the collaboration of the University of Leuven with Israel. During the official opening of the academic year at KU Leuven protesters lay on the street, just before the procession of professors in gowns was coming.
We, the undersigned, oppose an economic, political, or cultural boycott of Israel itself as defined by its June 4, 1967, borders. We believe that this so-called Green Line, as defined by the 1949 armistice, should be the starting point for negotiations between the Israeli and Palestinian parties on future boundaries between two states.
The 2016-2017 academic year has just started in occupied Palestine, and with it come the hopes and dreams of young students, but also the daily challenges of walking to school past Israeli soldiers, or driving through checkpoints in the West Bank, or assigning a culturally and politically relevant curriculum in annexed East Jerusalem, where Israel is trying to impose an Israeli curriculum in Palestinian schools.

MZ ETZ250 การปรับแต่ง: More Torque Fitting a 300 top end and an easy porting modification improve low end power to cure one of the ETZ250’s biggest riding problems. Experienced two-stroke specialist Derek Pickard explains how he got the right results. We all like the ETZ250. This model MZ is cheap to buy, keeps on going and does a good all-round job. It has only a couple of problems: typical two-stroke bad fuel consumption and disappointing low power below 3000rpm which is regularly an irritant. While there’s nothing much which can be done to the bad fuel economy, various people have had a few attempts at adding more power lower down in the rev range. One popular mod is to fit a different ...

There's a lot of overlap between this exam and the AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate, so I decided to make the most of my recent study efforts and go for a second AWS certification.
I went through a lot of the same materials I used for the exam I passed last week. I used the course from ACloudGuru on Udemy that covers this test, and I spent more time working on DynamoDB, SQS, Lambda, and SNS. I did a few more quiklabs focusing on those areas, and also read through a couple whitepapers pointed out in the AWS exam prep resource guide. I played around with Lambda a lot and also played with some of the AWS SDKs.
Other than that, I did similar things leading up to the exam day and on exam day as I did for the last exam.
My next steps in AWS will probably be either the AWS Certified SysOps Administrator - Associate or the AWS Certified DevOps Engineer - Professional, depending on what I see from practice exams and my initial foray into preparation. Learning is fun!

When you get a call from a school/ college administrator inviting you to interview for a faculty job, how do you feel? Happy? Nervous? Elated? Excited? Scared stiff?
Preparing for an interview to get a teaching job is like studying for a test. You don't need to worry about the teaching job interview questions if you're a well-prepared and a qualified candidate. If you prepare beforehand, the interview questions and answers for teachers will seem routine and familiar.
Below is a list of commonly asked academic job interview questions & answers to Getting the Teaching Job of Your Dreams. How would you answer each question?
Oh, yes, this is the question that is most likely to be asked first. Keep in mind, if it is the first question, it will set the stage for the interview, so it needs to be extremely strong. This is a great opportunity to sell yourself to the school / college district representatives.
Tell them about your career, what colleges you graduated from, what you're certified to teach, what your teaching and working experiences are, and why you'd love the job.
The interviewer who asks this question wants to discover, if you enjoy working in a team environment, you are flexible, have experience in this area, and what your viewpoints are on the subject. In this, always speak about some of the positive aspects of team-teaching.
It is an important question to show your hard/tangible skills. Now, if you researched the college/school and found out what they are seeking for in a candidate, you will be able to focus your response on that information, keeping in mind it is important to tell the truth. With every response, you must show your VALUE to the college. This will also give them an idea on how you view your talents and skills as a teacher. Perception is critical... you must be able to confidently discuss your skills using a convincing approach.
Your response should include something which may have recently been a challenge in the past, which you have taken steps to rectify. It is good to be truthful, they will be checking your honesty. In addition, they will be checking to see if you provide a weakness that is critical to success in the position.
Your preparation and research are imperative to successfully answer this question. Provide few explanations why you're considering in this particular institute or college and what in particular sparked your interest. What do you know about its faculty members, college student, industry reputation, educational goals and objectives, community engagement, upcoming initiatives, demographics, or extracurricular activities? This information will help you to accurately respond to the above question. The word accurate is important in the answer-- don't answer the questions by using old information. Effective research will help to tailor your answers, without being deceiving, to the question above.
The interviewer is seeking for evidence that you really know why you want to work there or did you just send out applications. This research will also help immensely when answering other questions throughout the interview, so plan to dedicate some time and energy doing this homework. It is wrong to tailor your answer with incorrect information - preparation and honesty are the key to a successful interview.
It is important, to be honest when answering all questions during the interview. By arranging your thoughts in advance will serve you in delivering truthful and concise responses, while illustrating your skills and compatibility to the district.

Khôra (Khora or Chora; Ancient Greek: χώρα) is a philosophical term described by Plato in Timaeus as a receptacle, a space, or an interval.

Michigan weather is usually pretty unpredictable, but we've had a pretty consistent summer thus far. Friday's forecast looks to be more of the same, so get ready to start tailgating, people.
This week's forecast has been a little all over the place. Early this week, the "experts" were calling for early thunderstorms and scattered showers across the afternoon. Now, thankfully, most weather services are calling for absolutely perfect outdoor festival weather conditions.
According to the Weather Channel, mother nature got all of that rain and thunder out of her system Thursday. We're looking at mostly sunny skies and temps in the high 70s / low 80s for most of the day, with things cooling off slightly by the time Seether takes the stage. I think we're all going to be pretty comfortable out there, but maybe bring some sunblock and, as always, stay hydrated.
Even though it's not currently in the forecast, keep in mind that this is a rain or shine event. This thing is happening, guys. Rain or no rain. However, in the event of lightning in the area, we will have to move everyone indoors until we get the all clear, at which point the show will resume. Chances are pretty damn good we don't have to worry about that, but you know Michigan weather.
The weather is looking good, and the parking lot is open all day. Grab a cooler, a grill, some hot dogs, maybe some cornhole boards, and whatever else you maniacs need to tailgate, and let's do this! Gates open at 2p.
I received a huge package from Polak Models with incredible detailed miniature grass and foliage. So I had to try them out on the base.
Next step will be to paint the miniature, but soo many projects are waiting here, can't say which I´m going to finish first.

"Fred Moten’s Statement in Support of a Boycott of Israeli Academic Institutions" (MLA-Members for Justice in Palestine, Sept 7, 2016): click here!
I’ve been learning something recently as the rhetorical energy surrounding the idea and actuality of an academic and cultural boycott of Israel—which is the least those of us who are still concerned not only with human life in Palestine but also, and more generally, with unsettled, non-colonial life can do—has increased and intensified.
David LLOYD: "The Malevolence of Occupation " (Dublin Review of Books, Issue 80, July, 2016): click here!
Boycott is, as many proudly recall, an Irish invention. The first boycott targeted a notorious land agent, the eponymous Captain Charles Boycott, for attempting to evict tenants. Inspired by the Land League, local people refused to serve or work for him, responding to his threat to their means of life by severing social and economic ties with him.
Israel’s biggest military companies last year rang alarm bells over a decline in international contracts, citing smaller budgets, more competition, and less desire for Israeli-made products as among the reasons. Is this an indicator that Israel’s arms industry might not be as invincible as it seems?
The recent release of a policy platform by the Movement for Black Lives has drawn both expressions of solidarity, as well as disavowals and strident criticism.
"Portuguese government withdraws from controversial project with Israeli police following BDS pressure " (BDS National Committee, Aug 23, 2016): click here!
The LAW TRAIN project, aimed at unifying police interrogation methodologies, has generated controversy in Portugal because of vocal opposition to Israel’s participation in the EU’s Horizon 2020 research framework and the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Israeli entities taking part.
"Samidoun international coordinator denied entry to Palestine, interrogated about BDS and prisoner solidarity" (AURDIP, Aug 23, 2016): click here!
Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network international coordinator Charlotte Kates was denied entry to Palestine at the King Hussein Bridge crossing from Jordan to occupied Palestine on Monday, 15 August, as she attempted to join a delegation of European parliamentarians and lawyers in support of Bilal Kayed and the Palestinian prisoners.
Sheldon Adelson, the Nevada casino mogul and conservative mega-donor, is leading a campaign against pro-Palestine groups on US college campuses and has funded posters that accuse individual students of supporting terrorism and promoting “Jew Hatred”.
Egypt and Lebanon have received extensive media coverage during the Rio Olympics, not because of their athletes’ sporting achievements (of which there is little to celebrate), but because of the political controversy surrounding their actions.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America has become the latest US denomination to take economic action against the Israeli occupation. At its triennial assembly last week in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the four million-member church, one of the largest in the US, voted on two separate resolutions targeting Israel’s occupation and human rights abuses, passing each by a landslide.
Notwithstanding the nomenclature, the M4BL platform is a prime example of the intersectionality among the multifarious struggles for justice. Such solidarity and witness underline the principles of the human rights-based approach to freedom and equality. The affirmed solidarity of the Black Lives movement with the Palestinian experience imbues the Palestinian struggle for human and national rights with renewed energy.
In this writing, I want to portray the psychological aspects and perceptions relating to the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement concerning Israel. I will not always refer to BDS as a singular movement, but also to the general idea of “boycott”.
Audrey BOMSE: "Furore over Black Lives' support of Palestine reveals movement's true allies" (Middle East Eye, Aug 11, 2016): click here!
Hysterical opposition from pro-Israel groups towards the Movement for Black Lives' platform highlights hypocritical politics.
The calls to boycott Israel aren’t intended to deny its legitimacy, but to encourage it to end its policy of occupation in the territories. Precisely because Israel is considered a legitimate state and a longstanding, proper member of the family of nations, the entire world demands that it follow this family’s accepted rules.
Marie-Danielle SMITH: "[Canadian] Greens add support for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel to official party policies" (National Post, Aug 7, 2016): click here!
Canadian Greens voted at their convention Sunday morning to add boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel to their roster of party policies, despite their leader opposing the resolution.
Barak RAVID: "World Sees Israel as a Pariah State, Senior Gov't Official Says" (Haaretz, Aug 7, 2016): click here!
Strategic Affairs Ministry aims to change the way Israel is perceived in the international arena, director general Sima Vaknin tells lawmakers; says victory will be achieved when Israel won't be equated with apartheid.
Jewish Voice for Peace formally endorses the Movement for Black Lives platform, which accuses Israel of practicing apartheid and committing genocide against the Palestinians.
The wide-ranging new platform of a coalition growing out of the Black Lives Matter movement includes harsh criticism of Israel, which it describes as an “apartheid state” that, it claims, perpetrates “genocide” against the Palestinian people, endorsing the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign.
Con COUGHLIN: "Israeli anger as Qatar backs campaign for global boycott" (The Telegraph, Aug 3, 2016): click here!
The Israeli government has reacted angrily to plans by the Gulf state of Qatar to support a group backed by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn which wants to impose a global trade and cultural boycott on the Jewish state.
The Israeli government has temporarily lifted the travel ban imposed on Omar Barghouti, the Palestinian human rights defender who cofounded the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement.
In 2016, a bill targeting organizations that choose to divest from Israel, AB 2844, was proposed in the California state legislature. In 2015, New York Governor Mario Cuomo also issued an executive order creating a blacklist of organizations that support Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) against Israel. This legal backlash, or “lawfare,” against the BDS movement is a direct response to the threat it represents to a powerful status quo.
Not long ago, a Jewish former neighbor of mine wrote to me to ask whether, as a member of Jewish Voice for Peace, I support the boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement. I replied that I’ve supported boycotts of companies that promote Israel’s occupation of Palestinian land for years now; otherwise, I explained, I would be complicit in a serious offense against humanity and international law.
"Irish public figures’ statement in support of Israel boycott" (The Palestinian Information Center, July 27): click here!
In an open letter published recently in the Irish Times and Irish Independent, thirteen of Ireland’s best-known musicians, writers, artists and sports stars have called on the Irish government to join them in supporting the growing worldwide boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) campaign against Israel.
Palestinian writer and activist Nada Elia responds to claims than economic boycott of Israel is bound to fail: BDS will never bankrupt Israel, and that is not necessary for it to achieve its goals: showing that the emperor has no clothes, and empowering justice-minded people everywhere to disengage from a hyper-militarized, violent rogue state, until it stops violating international law and the human rights of an oppressed people.
Haidar EID (Gaza): "BDS and Normalization: Palestinian Perspective" (The Palestine Chronicle, July 19, 2016): click here!
When we, Palestinian Civil Society, issued our 2005 BDS call, we were counting on people of conscience, rather than governments and complicit corporations... Our “International Community” consisted of civil society, churches, pension funds, municipalities, clubs, music bands, universities…etc.
Could there be, as the BDS proponents allege, an unfolding historical dialectic at work that would culminate in Israel's ultimate delegitimization in American society? Not so fast.
Israeli think-tank fellow Yossi Klein Halevi, writing recently in the Los Angeles Times would have American readers believe that the Boycott, Divest and Sanctions movement is “immoral” and threatens the peace of "the region's only intact society", while simultaneously boasting it can't touch Israel's health and global economic integration.

Originally named "The Frederiksted Hotel", this 32 room, 4 story, "in-town" hotel, was built sometime in the 1970's (date unknown at this time). The hotel was locally owned and managed for many years, and then eventually was sold to a Danish Family, the Vetter Family, who still own the hotel to date.
In April of 2016, the Vetter family, successful entrepreneurs in Europe, were unable to manage the hotel from Denmark, so they leased the building and the business to Paul Benedict, a local businessman. Remodeling of the rooms began the same month that Paul took over the hotel. Because of licensing laws in St Croix, Paul needed to rename the hotel since the Vetter family still needed to maintain their business license as the owners of the building under the name, The Frederiksted Hotel. After many hours of brainstorming, Paul decided on the name, The Inn on Strand Street.
Paul and his team of workers and designers, starting remodeling the hotel, room by room, in April of 2016, including the addition of a 4th floor penthouse and a 1st floor hostel.
​In September of 2017, hurricane Maria devastated the town of Frederiksted and the island and town lost power for over 2 months. Once power was restored, the team quickly resumed the remodeling process including a new generator, new high speed internet, a state of the art security system, new outdoor furniture, a guest laundry area, a guest and hostel kitchen, and updated rooms.

Theoretically, we’re halfway through the summer after July 4th. But since the school year here didn’t end until June 20th, we’re not at the halfway mark yet. Nope, no siree! It’s in the 90s, my schedule is more flexible, and I’m getting in lots of quality family time!
There’s something really satisfying about hanging out with everyone when the weather is hot. We can log in lazy pool days, enjoy evenings in the cul de sac after dinner blowing bubbles with all the extra sunlight, and stop looking at the clock so much. We can also pause for afternoon ice cream snacks, and let’s face it. Those are the best. Right now my freezer is fully stocked with EDY’S® Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream and EDY’S® Baby Ruth Ice Cream, and they’re getting a lot of attention. How could they not, when they’re inspired by two of my favorite candy bars?
Since you all know I’m the biggest bargirl ever when it comes to baking, I made a batch of Butterfinger® cookie bars to go along with my ice cream. There’s pretty much no greater combination in life than a good dessert bar and a bowl of ice cream.
The other day, my middle kid had her birthday weekend. She was born right before July 4th, which means that the doctors didn’t bother us at all in the hospital after she was born. They literally ran off to picnics and barbecues, leaving us behind. In fact, the doctor who delivered her met his wife that night at a party. It was a strangely tranquil weekend, and I remember just relaxing with my newborn and eating an entire package of cookies. Hey, I’d earned it.
What struck me at the time was how important family is to everyone, even busy-seeming hospital staff. I mean, the place was nearly deserted. There aren’t many times of year when people just clear a place and head home en masse, but summertime is when we all want to be together. The summer nights might be long, but the months pass quickly. Actually, so do the years. That newborn is now six years old, and she’s not a baby anymore.
Thankfully, she’s someone whom I also like as well as love, and we have a lot in common. One is our endless fondness for ice cream. When she saw the containers of EDY’S® Ice Cream in the freezer, she knew that the best kind of Walmart trip had just taken place. We took out spoons and had a snack moment together, just my birthday girl and her proud mommy. Plus, I feel a lot better about sharing ice cream with my kids when it’s made with fresh milk & cream with no rBST (milk production hormone). This ice cream is so good, and it has the good stuff in it too!
To go along with our ice cream, I made these Butterfinger cookie bars. The base is a chewy peanut butter cookie, and then I filled the dough with chopped up fun-sized candy bars. I even crumbled some more Butterfinger on top for the perfect finish!
When paired with EDY’S® Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream, these cookie bars make the perfect summer snack. It’s even better during these long summer days that we all spend together. Take some time out with the people you love! This is the time, y’all.
Preheat the oven to 350. Line an 8-inch square pan with foil and coat with cooking spray. Set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the eggs, butter, peanut butter, vanilla, brown sugar and sugar until creamy.
Pat the cookie dough into the prepared pan evenly. Chop the remaining Butterfinger bars more finely and sprinkle them over the top of the dough.
It’s kind of amazing that after so many years and experiences, movie night still makes my heart go pitter-patter. There’s just something unquestionably fun about breaking out of the nightly bedtime routine with my kids and letting us all relax and enjoy a great movie!
Everywhere I look these days, I see ads for Botox. Is it just me, or is everyone offering to inject your face? First it was dermatologists. Then my dentist joined the game. I wouldn’t be surprised if they start offering Botox along with your latte at Starbucks.
It’s just not fashionable to age gracefully. Okay, cool. Though I sometimes wonder if the Botox makes people look younger. They just look…smoother.
But knowing me, I’ll probably be running to the needle soon enough. I’m very into trends. Fads are awesome. They’re totally logical and everyone should do what their friends are doing.
In the meantime, my secrets to the fountain of youth are simple. Sleep. Eat veggies and fish. Drink water and green tea. Use moisturizer and sunscreen, even when it’s fifty below zero outside (vampire skin is sexy). And eat peanut butter every day, preferably along with your daily hefty dose of chocolate. See? Simple!
In case I’ve never made it blatantly clear enough, pound cake is the happiest of all cakes. It’s fluffy, buttery, and makes a perfect canvas for any flavor.
Do you know what happens if you add 7UP® to pound cake? It gets even lighter and fluffier. And when you add Cherry 7UP® and almond extract, your mouth is in for quite the party.
Oh these butterfinger cookie bars look SO good, Mir! I always forget to bake with butterfingers, so I definitely need to change that. And Edy’s new ice cream flavor has me craving them all the time! What a fun summer treat!
Hope your baby girl (not a baby anymore) had the best birthday! As for this recipe, well, you had me at Butterfinger. BUTTERFINGER ANYTHING! And with ice cream – oh, my my.
My mom and I share an ice cream love, too. We should definitely make these bars and serve them with a big bowl of IC 😉 What a great treat, Mir!
These bars look so good Mir! Hope you had a wonderful long weekend and belated birthday wishes to your baby!
Butterfingers are my husband’s favorite, so he would love these!! And please don’t say the summer is halfway over!! I feel like it’s only getting started 🙂
I am with you, Mir, bar cookies are awesome! They are easy to throw together and they are great travelers (care packages, picnics, or just from the kitchen counter to the table! 😉 Butterfingers are a favorite baking add-in at our house, so I am excited to give these a try! (The summer is MORE than half over here. My daughter, the teacher, goes back for in-service days on August 4!)
Wow, that’s early! Inservice here starts on the 24th. I guess it depends where in the country you find yourself. And like you, I prefer bars to cookies. Easier, thicker, more packable. What’s not to love?
Butterfingers are seriously the best. And in icecream, two thumbs up!!! I love making bar cookies, so much easier 🙂
Mir!!! Look at you! Posting, making these fabulous butterfinger cookie bars AND packing up your office at school?!!! How are you?? And I absolutely agree!!! There’s pretty much no greater combination in life than a good dessert bar and a bowl of ice cream!!!! I want like TWO of your bars like now! they look incredible!
It’s been a VERY busy couple of weeks, Alice! I’m trying to figure out how to balance it all, but it’s a process. Thanks for all the props. You make my day brighter!
Happy belated birthday to your daughter! Being a cancer (or july baby) is the best… ahh hem… not that I’m biased or anything. 😉 You are definitely THE bar queen!! I’ve learned to expect nothing but the best when it comes to baked desserts from you, especially if that dessert is a bar and THESE are no exception!! It has been FOREVER since I’ve even thought about a butterfinger! LOVE that you turned those flavors into bar form!! Genius as usual, my dear! Cheers!
OMIGOSH, I am drooling over this ice-cream/bar combo here. YUM! Ice cream is my favorite dessert hands down. Pair that up with a gooey and delicious dessert bar? I’m in heaven! Good job!
I love that you put butterfingers in the bars! I always forget about them, but they’re one of my favorite candies!

Millions of people have never understood Jesus as a human personality; a man with dusty feet and calloused hands. Millions more might grow to love him if they could walk alongside him for a while on the dirty roads of Palestine or spend an evening by the campfire with him and his disciples talking about the God who loved fishermen, prostitutes and thieves. They might really like the Jesus who loved to laugh and tell jokes, often about institutionalized religion. In this volume of The Justus Scrolls, Joseph bar Sabbas, called Justus, theologian, philosopher, educator and erudite crafter of words, takes us step by step through the searing personal adventures, miracles and teachings of the Man, Jesus. Under flickering shadows he pens an irresistible story; swift-paced, romantic, violent, gentle, bawdy, comic, lyrical, hard-bitten, haunting and passionate; guiding his readers heartbeat by heartbeat in the steps of this Carpenter of wood, this Carpenter of Men.
"THE JUSTUS SCROLLS" made me feel like I was there myself, following Jesus'' every move. I always wanted to know about what Jesus may have eaten or where he slept, and where he went. Fiction, yes, but only to a degree, based on sound Biblical and recent archeological facts. Each evening I look forward to reading a few chapters before bed, and I ask myself, "I wonder where Jesus will be tonight and what he has been doing today?" My problem is trying to stop reading because it is so action filled. Being a dog lover, Abishag adds such additional warmth and love. It's a page turner for sure, but it's also a satisfying, rich and fascinating "re-read." -- Joan Conant
Even if the reader realizes that there's some fiction intertwined with facts, this unusual page turner depicts the life of Jesus so uniquely that it was hard for me to put it down.
Now more than ever, our celebrity hung-up society needs to read stories like "The Justus Scrolls". I highly recommend it.
The Justus Scrolls gives the reader a sense of what it feels like to be close to the humanness of Jesus. One feels as though Jesus were standing at his shoulder reading with him. But this time you can hear him breathe, you can smell him. It is almost as if you can see him. And such an experience to be so close to the Man who is God, is a wondrous, powerful emotion. As he can be “touched with the feeling” of our infirmities, so we become “touched with the feeling” of his presence and of his love.
The Justus Scrolls added so many wonderful insights to my understanding of the Gospel. The old, old story told with the perspective of the "non selected" apostle was what attracted me to the book. It reminded me that we all have a story to tell no matter what position we hold in the Lord's family. How often we see a "no" as a stop, instead of redirection.
I do wonder how many more stories we will hear when we meet all those obscure folks that followed Jesus while he was here. The author's words reveal years of research and a heartfelt investment. I was truly blessed. Thank you so much. As St. John said, there would never be enough books to hold all the mighty works He has done.
In reading The Justus Scrolls, I felt for the first time that someone was showing me the real Jesus within the world of the first century. More important, since Jesus is God in human flesh, the author gave me a new view of a God with the power to create a universe, but also with the love to forgive us all - even the soldiers who crucified him. The Justus Scrolls reveal a real Jesus and a real God.
JUSTUS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY SEARCH TO KNOW MORE ABOUT JESUS AND HIS DISCIPLES (reviewer's emphasis). In my continuous search to know more about Jesus’ quest to establish His kingdom on Earth in such a short span of time, His selection of the disciples was most important . . . how He chose them, how He related to them, how He led them.
By the time I finished this book, I felt that I knew each of them intimately, and had almost been a part of their journey. A rare insight into the lives of these twelve men who truly, through and with Christ, changed the world.
I have never read any book that is written so "smoothly" that you just RACE though the pages. Although the size of the book is overwhelming (to me) - I just started picking any random page and find myself ENGROSSED so much that I would finish 2-3 sections without even stopping for a breath. I have decided to keep it on my desk for a year and 'swiss-cheese' my way through it.
I have read stories and seen movies of Jesus' life many times. But when I read The Justus Scrolls it was as if I was right there, as a young boy, meeting him, traveling with him as he grew up, and experiencing life with him. Jesus became so much more real to me. The author has captured the essence of Jesus' life in this book. As I read it, I felt the joys and pain that he went through. As a result I love him more than ever. As the old hymn goes . . . "What a friend we have in Jesus". I am grateful to the author for helping us to see Christ as a man, touchable, as a brother and as the Son of God.
When I read the book, I think the author is spot on about Jesus. I loved the section on driving the money-changers out of the temple. more . . .

The vice-president of the International Network of Genocide Scholars has pulled out of the group’s conference at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, following appeals by Palestine solidarity campaigners. BDS South Africa, an organization supporting the Palestinian call for a boycott of Israel, has announced that University of Cape Town professor Mohamed Adhikari had informed it that he has withdrawn his presentation from the conference. The British genocide scholar Martin Shaw has also announced he is pulling out of the conference, which begins Sunday.

Last month, a group of students at the University of California, Irvine gathered to protest a screening of the film Beneath the Helmet, a documentary about the lives of recruits in the Israeli Defense Forces.

The human rights and Palestine solidarity organisation BDS South Africa welcomes the withdrawal by the Centre of Violence and Reconciliation (CSVR) from an upcoming conference in Israel.

Israel’s attacks on the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement and other human rights defenders living under occupation, such as Al Haq staff, have dominated the headlines in recent weeks, including the direct threats made by leading Israeli officials against BDS activists and in particular against the movement’s co-founder Omar Barghouti.

When Michael Karayanni was appointed law school dean, Isaac Herzog hailed it as 'break[ing] another glass ceiling for Israel’s Arabs'. But one academic's success can't erase Israel's institutionalized racism directed at its Arab citizens.
There is much to discuss and some of the issues are difficult ones, including questions of framing. Al-Shabaka Executive Director Nadia Hijab discussed some of these issues in a wide-ranging conversation with Omar Barghouti.
Even those who don’t believe in the boycott, or think there are better ways to fight the occupation (such as?) cannot go along with this crushing move to criminalize it.
Steven SALAITA: "Israel Boycott Has Staying Power" (The Chronicle of Higher Education, June 8, 2016): click here!
It’s crucial to think about why academic boycott exists in the first place. It is not a silly diversion from the serious work of teaching, service, and research. It affirms the ideals of equal access underlying that work. The immediate goal of academic boycott is to offer fellowship to our colleagues in Palestine. Its ultimate goal is to help provide much-needed relief from the miserable conditions under which they often labor.

The salary and compensation data cover instructional and research staff members who work full time and whose primary role (more than 50 percent) is instruction, regardless of their official faculty status. The calculations exclude part-time faculty members, medical school faculty members, professors at military institutions who are compensated on a military pay scale, those with faculty status who are primarily administrative officers, and graduate teaching assistants. Some institutions include data for professional school faculty members.
Salary figures exclude summer teaching, stipends and other non-contracted forms of remuneration. When instructors are compensated for 11 or 12 months' work, their salaries are adjusted to a nine-month academic-year basis. Salary figures are rounded to the nearest $100.
The compensation figure for a faculty member includes an institution's contribution to benefits as well as salary; it does not include faculty contributions. The counted benefits include retirement contributions, medical insurance, disability income protection, tuition for faculty dependents, Social Security, unemployment insurance, group life insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and other benefits with cash value such as moving expenses and housing allowances.
"Salary Equity" refers to the ratio between the average salary for women by rank divided by the average men’s salary, times 100. For example, if an institution had an average woman’s salary for an assistant professor of $100,000 and an average man’s salary for an assistant professor of $100,000, the gender equity ratio would be at 100.0, or parity. A ratio below 100 indicates the cents on the dollar of an average woman’s salary below a man’s average salary at that rank, and a ratio above 100 indicates the average woman’s salary above a man’s average salary at that rank.

O most holy heart of Jesus, fountain of every blessing, I adore you, I love you, and with lively sorrow for my sins I offer you this poor heart of mine. Make me humble, patient, pure and wholly obedient to your will. Grant, Good Jesus, that I may live in you and for you. Protect me in the midst of danger. Comfort me in my afflictions. Give me health of body, assistance in my temporal needs, your blessing on all that I do, and the grace of a holy death. Amen.

Pope Francis speaks during his general audience in Paul VI hall at the Vatican in this Jan. 7 file photo.(CNS photo/Paul Haring)
VATICAN CITY (CNS) — Drop the innocent look and the habit of judging others, Pope Francis said; recognizing one’s own faults and failings is the first requirement of being a good Christian.
In fact, paradoxically, one finds peace and relief in judging one’s own sins, being merciful toward others and saying, “Who am I to judge?” he said March 2 during his homily at a morning Mass celebrated in the chapel of the Domus Sanctae Marthae, where he lives.
The pope’s homily was based on the day’s reading from the Book of Daniel, which laments, “We have sinned, been wicked and done evil,” and expresses the shame of having rebelled against God who is so full of compassion and mercy. It also focused on the Gospel reading according to St. Luke, in which Jesus tells his disciples to stop judging and condemning, but to “be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.”
“We are all experts, we have Ph.D.s in justifying ourselves: ‘But it wasn’t me, no, it’s not my fault. Well, OK, but it wasn’t that bad, you know. That’s not how it went.’ We all have an alibi to explain away our failings, our sins,” he said.
“So often we are able to make that face that says, ‘Who, me?’ that face that says, ‘Well, I didn’t do it, maybe it was someone else,’ playing innocent,” he said. “But one doesn’t progress in Christian life this way.”
While it is easier to blame others, “when we begin to look at the things we are capable of,” the evil that one is tempted to commit, he said at first “we feel bad, we feel disgust,” but then “something a bit strange happens,” the self-critical approach then “gives us peace and well-being.”
By directly, honestly and quietly confronting the evil within, such as feeling envy and knowing how it can lead to putting people down and “killing them morally,” he said, one discovers “the wisdom of accusing oneself.”
“If we do not learn this first step in life, we will never, ever make progress on the path of Christian life, spiritual life,” he said, according to Vatican Radio.
Another Christian virtue is being able to feel ashamed before God, he said. Christians should engage in a kind of dialogue with the Lord, not being afraid to feel that shame expressed in the Book of Daniel.
When people can see their own faults, he said, it is easier to ask God for mercy and to be merciful toward others.
“When someone learns to accuse oneself, one is merciful toward others: ‘Yes, but who am I to judge if I am capable of doing worse things?'”
The phrase, “Who am I to judge,” he said, comes from listening to Jesus telling his disciples to “Stop judging and you will not be judged. Stop condemning and you will not be condemned. Forgive and you will be forgiven.”
The day before, after praying the Angelus with visitors gathered in St. Peter’s Square, Pope Francis urged people to listen to Jesus and follow him because only he brings true happiness.
While following Jesus will always mean carrying some kind of cross and enduring some hardship, the pope said, “in the end he always brings us happiness. Jesus does not deceive, he promised happiness and he will give it if we follow his ways.”
By following Jesus, one’s life can become “a gift of love toward others, in docile obedience to God’s will, with an approach of detachment from worldly things and of inner freedom,” he said.
This blog is about historic costume, primarily Western costume, from the dawn of history until about 1600 C.E.
Stella Anderson of Historical Living with Hvitr has nominated this blog for something called the Liebster Award.
I have received a similar award before, years ago; the Versatile Blogger award. This sort of award is meant to be a way for bloggers to recognize fellow bloggers of quality. The idea is that each nominated person agrees, in turn, to nominate suitable blogs and asks each nominated blog to feature the award tag, to nominate a specified number of other bloggers, to answer questions about him or herself and/or the subject of his/her blogging, and to generate a question list for his/her nominees.
I am touched that Stella nominated me, and I have no problem with the idea of such awards/mutual support networks. However, my pleasure evaporated as I looked at the Liebster website (which happened because you're asked to link to that site as part of accepting the award). The Liebster website (specifically, the page with the Liebster award rules on it) is packed full of advertising by the woman who runs it for her services in teaching people how to monetize their blog and learn to blog more "effectively".
I don't like the idea of using the "award" mechanic as a way of advertising one's own commercial services. Moreover, my impression from the webpage is that the Liebster Award is a much better means for the Liebster Award's creator to get web traffic for her blog than it is for other bloggers to support each other and find new blogs of high quality but (currently) low readership.
On the other hand, I'm sure that Stella nominated me because she likes my work and wanted other people to see and appreciate it too. I don't want to show disrespect to her by simply refusing to accept the award. Thank you so much, Stella, for thinking of me and thinking well of me.
So what I've decided to do is to do all of the fun things about the Liebster award, such as answering questions, posing new questions, and providing a list of blogs I'd like to recognize as wonderful and worth reading. But I expressly do NOT intend to accept the Liebster award, and to that end I'm deliberately ignoring some of the "rules". Specifically, I'm not including the Liebster label on this post. Nor am I listing the Liebster Award rules in this post (anyone who is curious can use the link to the Liebster page above to look them up).
I don't really have a movie costume favorite. I'm more likely to be inspired by historical models than movie costumes.
The very first "Eura" style dress that I made; you can see a picture of it above. It is wonderfully comfortable as well as being washable and attractive; I really love the red trim I found to put on it.
Yes. My mother helped me make a Kinsale cloak from a silk wool twill, and when I was in college I wore it sometimes as outerwear with ordinary clothes. Unfortunately, it was a light enough fabric that it wasn't very warm, but it was a rosy red in color, and gorgeous! I can't recall if anyone noticed or remarked about it, though.
Learning how to properly finish seams. I used to have real problems with this, both because I found it to be boring, and because my seam allowances were so irregular that binding them was a real problem. Since then I've learned techniques for doing a nicely finished hand-sewn seam, but I'm still at sea with regard to machine sewn finishings.
I prefer to make costumes using measurements that dictate how big the pieces of the costume must be, which isn't exactly a pattern. If I'm making something more modern (say, from the 16th century onwards), I prefer to use a pattern because I don't have the faintest idea how to begin drafting a "modern" pattern.
Finishing the shawl I started for my Iron Age Lithuanian outfit (pictures here). It still needs to have the rest of the fringe added and some copper spirals sewn onto it.
7. Do you tend to plan costumes around personas you want to play, or construct personas for costumes you want to make?
I don't really have personae because I don't do reenactment, but it's closest to say that I construct personae for costumes I want to make because they look interesting or because I want to learn how it feels to wear them.
Historical Enterprises sells reproductions of Viking era thread winders made from bone or horn (buyer's choice). I'd love to have a few for my Viking sewing kit, but at $2.95 US each it seems kind of frivolous for me to buy them right now.
9. You, of course, are a modern person living in the 21st century. Do you think that has an effect on how you think about your historical projects?
Absolutely. It is hard for a modern person to think about clothing, and making clothing, in the same way that a person living in earlier times would, because clothing (even "expensive" clothing) is so inexpensive now, both in terms of the time it takes to make it and in terms of the cost of the materials and tools used to make it.
My favorite metaphor for how people must have considered the clothes they wore in pre-modern times is the automobile. Like modern cars, clothing was expensive relative to food or other survival needs, but just as most modern people need to have and use a car daily, everyone needed to own and use clothing daily. Similarly, the tendency was to patch (i.e., repair) and keep wearing their clothing for as long as possible, just as most people try to keep their cars drivable for as long as possible today. Clothing was also a major item of status display, and poorer but ambitious people tried to obtain clothing that made them look as though their status was greater than it actually was, just as people try to obtain the nicest car possible for their money. By the same token, just as rich people today have nicer cars and more of them, rich people in earlier times had more clothing and clothing made from more expensive materials than poor people did.
After all these years of sewing, I've finally gotten pretty good at simulating the aspect of early clothing that involves making it with care to last, from good materials bought in as small a quantity that will serve the purpose. However, I have a very hard time treating my period clothing as though it is clothing I wear everyday. For example, it drives me nuts if I get the least bit of dirt on any of the period clothing I've made while I'm wearing it, and that kind of mindset would have been impractical for someone living in, say, the tenth century.
I would love to visit Viking age Scandinavia, but for me to use a time machine to do so would be foolish, because I don't know any of the Scandinavian languages well enough even to make my basic needs understood, which would make me very vulnerable to exploitation and worse. So if I did have access to a time machine, I'd stick to the Philadelphia area right before the American Revolution, because that's far enough in the past to be interesting to me but not so far back in time that I couldn't make myself understood, and my handsewing is (probably just barely) good enough that I could have made money that way.
I've been having trouble getting excited about costume with my employment situation so unstable, but the project I'm planning now--the sprang cap for the July HSM Challenge, is pretty exciting, because I've never tried sprang before.
A String Geek's Stash. For bringing back to life excellent old research, and thereby showing us all a different way to use a blog.

Medieval York | Eulalia Piebakere's adventures in recreational medievalism. For candidly showing us all the process by which she is growing as a scholar of historical food and costume.
Finally, I'm not "nominating" anyone for the Liebster, but if anyone who reads my blog would like, just for fun, to answer any or all of the following questions, either in comments here or on their blog, please feel free!
1. What is the most authentic item of historical material culture (clothing, food, furniture, jewelry, tools) you have ever created and what did you do to create it?
9. Describe what your ideal historical costume would be like (whether or not you have attempted to make it for yourself).
Don't worry, I don't feel at all disrespected :) , and thank you for answering my questions because I was really interested to see people's answers! I think the Liebster award is a nice way to show appreciation for blogs one admires, and introduce people to cool blogs they may not have encountered before, but I have to say I was a bit concerned about the level of advertising myself.
The Eura dress is lovely, especially with the trim. Such beautiful colours! I'm very impressed with your Iron Age Lithuanian outfit too and would love to see the shawl finished. That embroidery they used to do with wire spiral beads is spectacular.
I felt that the questions, and the bringing attention to blogs one admires, are the most attractive things behind such web awards anyway. I'm glad you understand.
Long ago, I made a second Eura-style dress (dark blue with white and blue trim) but never liked it quite as well. It is part of an early attempt by me to recreate the costume of the woman in the Eura, Finland grave (c.1000 CE). Because of the way it was constructed, it should still fit me even though I've since gained weight. Maybe some day I'll get Eric to take a picture of me wearing it, and post it on this blog.
There are many people who've made better Iron Age Lithuanian clothing than my outfit, but given how little I knew about the period when I started it, I'm pleased at how well it came out. I'm pleased that you like it. Probably all I will do re: spiral wire applique will be to string spirals on a cord as long as the short ends of the shawl is wide and stitch the cord down.
This is a blog about historic costume. Although I hope that many people I have never met, and will never meet, will read and enjoy this blog, and will comment on my posts in an attempt to start or pursue discussions, I am not interested in receiving comments, or having extended discussions, about non-costume-related topics here. If you comment here on non-costume-related topics, I reserve the right to conclude that your comment is (machine-generated) spam and remove it without further notice.
I'm married to the Eric S. Raymond who's responsible for "The New Hacker's Dictionary," "The Cathedral and the Bazaar," and other works of intellectual mayhem. I'm a lawyer by profession, but my real loves are medieval history and historic costume, and have been since adolescence. I've come from machine sewing polyester t-tunics to handsewing period-documentable designs in pure wool and linen. Maybe I'll get into historical reenactment when I finally retire from law.

“I personally really love the natural light that we get from the windows and sliding door in the living room. It makes the main living area seem that much bigger. Having an actual laundry room instead of just a laundry closet is nice too. It’s easy to shut the door and hide the dirty laundry when company comes over! Plus, the rooftop deck is pretty great! We love grilling and eating up there or having a glass of wine after the baby goes to bed. I know we’ll really miss the view!”

Since his appearance in La Haine (Hate) in 1993, Vincent Cassel has made a name for himself as one of the most talented and versatile actors of his generation, having switched effortlessly from independent productions like the Mesrine and controversial Irreversible to big budget blockbusters such as Oceans’ Twelve and Thirtheen. To mark the release of his new film Black Swan, where he stars alongside Natalie Portman, Chic-Londres has decided to retrieve its exclusive 2009 London interview with the French star.
You have been honoured by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) which described you as the “golden boy” of French cinema, how do you feel about that? I am not sure I deserve to be described as a “golden boy”, although I am obviously delighted – especially considering how important the Academy is in Britain. I really didn’t expect it to happen, particularly since I am the first Frenchman at this event, which makes it all the more flattering. I knew I had some kind of following in the UK, but the fact that I have been recognised in such a formal way is very reassuring. I need reassurance just like everybody else.
Your wife, the actress and top model Monica Bellucci, lives in London, where you have filmed Elizabeth and Eastern promises: would you consider moving here on a permanent basis? I really feel comfortable in London. I lived here for a while when I was younger, I made several films here and my wife lives here, which obviously means that I spend a lot of time in this city. However, I wouldn’t leave Paris to settle in London full time: if I ever decide to leave Paris, then I will want to leave behind the stress, pollution and traffic jams, so there wouldn’t be much point in coming here to find exactly the same thing.
Which role was the most difficult to play and on which film set have you had the most fun? The most difficult role for me was in Sheitan, because the character was so different from me, and because I had to push the boundaries of acting to the point of ridicule. I had most fun on one of my last films (Les Seigneurs, to be released in 2010), probably because I have been very close to the team for so long: I was in fits of laughter at least twice a day, which is unusual even for me. Generally speaking though, I really have fun on shoots: when I am acting, I feel like a kid in the playground, able to get rid of all my inhibitions. That said, acting in itself can actually be very serious. That’s because immersing yourself into a character can trigger very strong emotions and tension, which I release by laughing a lot. Contrary to what one may think, I actually had a lot of fun on Irreversible, even though the film’s violence makes it so difficult to watch. On the other hand, you don’t necessarily have lots of fun when filming a comedy.
How does it feel to switch from indie films to big blockbusters and is there much difference between theway French and American directors operate on set? People outside the business often imagine film sets in a way that is very different from reality. But in my opinion, there are not that many differences between an indie and a blockbuster: as far as I am concerned as an actor, my work is always the same and I always immerse myself in a role in exactly the same way, whatever the budget. There might be more hierarchy when shooting an American film, but even then, it all depends on the film. The real difference lies in the distribution process, which is much heavier with American films, but that has nothing to do with the acting itself.
You have shot five films with your wife, Monica Bellucci: do you manage to distance yourself from your amily life when on set? I don’t want to distance myself, on the contrary, as our shared experience helps me in my roles. I personally believe that being close to the other actors makes it easier to play alongside them. And incidentally, it is absolutely lovely to be able to share those acting moments with people you love, be it your wife or friends.
1996 : Meets his future wife Monica Bellucci while shooting The Apartment with her and marries her in 1999 (daughter Deva born in 2004)
2009 : Receives the César award for Best Actor for his performance in both Mesrine movies and becomes the face of the new Yves Saint Laurent men’s fragrance, La Nuit de l’Homme

Generally, the context in which an individual lives is of great importance for both his health status and quality of their life[18]. It is increasingly recognized that health is maintained and improved not only through the advancement and application of health science, but also through the efforts and intelligent lifestyle choices of the individual and society. According to the World Health Organization, the main determinants of health include the social and economic environment, the physical environment and the person's individual characteristics and behaviors.[19]
Scheduled health insurance plans are not meant to replace a traditional comprehensive health insurance plans and are more of a basic policy providing access to day-to-day health care such as going to the doctor or getting a prescription drug. In recent years[when?], these plans have taken the name "mini-med plans" or association plans. The term "association" is often used to describe them because they require membership in an association that must exist for some other purpose than to sell insurance. Examples include the Health Care Credit Union Association. These plans may provide benefits for hospitalization and surgical, but these benefits will be limited. Scheduled plans are not meant to be effective for catastrophic events. These plans cost much less than comprehensive health insurance. They generally pay limited benefits amounts directly to the service provider, and payments are based upon the plan's "schedule of benefits". As of 2005, "annual benefit maxima for a typical mini scheduled health insurance plan may range from $1,000 to $25,000".[68]
Today, this system is more or less intact. All citizens and legal foreign residents of France are covered by one of these mandatory programs, which continue to be funded by worker participation. However, since 1945, a number of major changes have been introduced. Firstly, the different health care funds (there are five: General, Independent, Agricultural, Student, Public Servants) now all reimburse at the same rate. Secondly, since 2000, the government now provides health care to those who are not covered by a mandatory regime (those who have never worked and who are not students, meaning the very rich or the very poor). This regime, unlike the worker-financed ones, is financed via general taxation and reimburses at a higher rate than the profession-based system for those who cannot afford to make up the difference. Finally, to counter the rise in health care costs, the government has installed two plans, (in 2004 and 2006), which require insured people to declare a referring doctor in order to be fully reimbursed for specialist visits, and which installed a mandatory co-pay of €1 for a doctor visit, €0.50 for each box of medicine prescribed, and a fee of €16–18 per day for hospital stays and for expensive procedures.

Most aspects of private health insurance in Australia are regulated by the Private Health Insurance Act 2007. Complaints and reporting of the private health industry is carried out by an independent government agency, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman. The ombudsman publishes an annual report that outlines the number and nature of complaints per health fund compared to their market share [10]

"The linear model supported previous findings, including regular exercise, limited alcohol consumption, abstinence from smoking, sleeping 7–8 hours a night, and maintenance of a healthy weight play an important role in promoting longevity and delaying illness and death."

The environment is often cited as an important factor influencing the health status of individuals. This includes characteristics of the natural environment, the built environment and the social environment. Factors such as clean water and air, adequate housing, and safe communities and roads all have been found to contribute to good health, especially to the health of infants and children.[19][30] Some studies have shown that a lack of neighborhood recreational spaces including natural environment leads to lower levels of personal satisfaction and higher levels of obesity, linked to lower overall health and well being.[31] This suggests that the positive health benefits of natural space in urban neighborhoods should be taken into account in public policy and land use.
Prolonged sitting is terrible for our bodies. It has been linked to heart disease, diabetes and early death. If you have a desk job, make sure to get up and move frequently even if you have to set your alarm on your smartphone to sound every hour to remind you. “Ten-minute spurts of exercise throughout the day can counteract that risk,” says Gianos.
In addition to safety risks, many jobs also present risks of disease, illness and other long-term health problems. Among the most common occupational diseases are various forms of pneumoconiosis, including silicosis and coal worker's pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). Asthma is another respiratory illness that many workers are vulnerable to. Workers may also be vulnerable to skin diseases, including eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, sunburn, and skin cancer.[60][61] Other occupational diseases of concern include carpal tunnel syndrome and lead poisoning.
A high deductible health insurance plan has higher deductibles and lower premiums than most other health insurance plans. This means you pay a smaller fixed amount every month, but it will take a longer time for insurance to kick in and begin cost-sharing (meaning you will pay your percentage of coinsurance for every bill). You might benefit from this plan if you don’t require many doctor’s visits or other healthcare benefits. Look at quotes for high deductible health insurance plans to figure out if this plan is right for you.
Prescription drug plans are a form of insurance offered through some health insurance plans. In the U.S., the patient usually pays a copayment and the prescription drug insurance part or all of the balance for drugs covered in the formulary of the plan. Such plans are routinely part of national health insurance programs. For example, in the province of Quebec, Canada, prescription drug insurance is universally required as part of the public health insurance plan, but may be purchased and administered either through private or group plans, or through the public plan.[4]
Since the late 1970s, the federal Healthy People Initiative has been a visible component of the United States’ approach to improving population health.[11][12] In each decade, a new version of Healthy People is issued,[13] featuring updated goals and identifying topic areas and quantifiable objectives for health improvement during the succeeding ten years, with assessment at that point of progress or lack thereof. Progress has been limited to many objectives, leading to concerns about the effectiveness of Healthy People in shaping outcomes in the context of a decentralized and uncoordinated US health system. Healthy People 2020 gives more prominence to health promotion and preventive approaches and adds a substantive focus on the importance of addressing social determinants of health. A new expanded digital interface facilitates use and dissemination rather than bulky printed books as produced in the past. The impact of these changes to Healthy People will be determined in the coming years.[14]

A wobbly real estate sector nearing what might be described as a “bubble,” driven by political instability and unjustified valuations.
There exists a mismatch between purchasing power and real estate valuations exerting corrective pressures.
As the title clearly states, this article is about the real estate sector in Lebanon. It will be the first of many articles, as it is difficult to capture all the intricacies of this sector in only one article. In this first article, I try to understand the current situation of the sector, I also analyze current market prices and compare them with other countries. The idea for the article stems from the fact that real estate has been the sector of choice for most investments in Lebanon for the past 5-6 years as prices rose dramatically during that period.
Current Situation: At the present time, the situation of the real estate sector in Lebanon is not great. It is characterized by very low activity (very few transactions) and decreasing prices (this is a new trend that is almost never clearly stated). I believe there are two main reasons for this condition: first, the unstable local and regional political situation is seriously deterring people from investing big sums of money into fixed assets while unsure of the future of the country they are investing in. Second, the price levels have reached levels so high that are totally unjustified and out of reach for the vast majority of the people who would normally constitute the real demand. In fact, I believe we are well into bubble territory, and a correction (the extent of which is difficult to determine at this point in time) is inevitable.
Market Prices: Here, let us give a numerical example to illustrate how much the current prices are out of sync with the purchasing power of the people who should be the target audience for this sector. Assuming a price/sqm of USD3,500 (which is the average for most neighborhoods in Beirut), a 200 sqm apartment would cost USD700,000. From a buyer's perspective, a USD700,000 apartment implies a monthly installment of USD5,162 over a period of 20 years (including interest – at the prevailing levels of interest - and registration fees). Now, given the fact that the monthly mortgage payment cannot exceed 1/3 of a person’s monthly income as per Central Bank regulations (that are strictly applied by Lebanese banks); this means that the person buying this apartment should be earning at least USD15,488 per month! Anyone who knows the job market in Lebanon knows that extremely few people make that much money. The consequence of what we explained above is that people who buy out of income are almost ALL priced out of the market; which by itself reduces demand dramatically. What is left is people who buy out of wealth. However, most of these people already have houses (in most cases, multiple houses) and don’t need to buy anymore; moreover it is mostly these people who bought during the past 5-6 years, implying that the size of demand constituted by people who buy out of wealth has shrunk substantially.
Comparison with Other Countries: To make things clearer, we compared real estate prices in Lebanon with ones in few countries around the world selected randomly (we tried to avoid countries that have special situations like Monaco, or are in wars like Egypt or Syria). The table below illustrates the findings:
This table shows that in real terms (comparing apples with apples), real estate prices in Lebanon are the highest among the 8 countries present in the list as the ratio of average real estate prices / GDP per capital is the highest. If we take this same logic further, we can compute how much should the price of m2 in Beirut be if the ratio of price/sqm to GDP per capita would be similar to the other countries in the list. The table below illustrated the findings:
So, this table shows that if real estate prices in Beirut are to be the same as in Dubai (relative to purchasing power parity), the price/sqm in Beirut should be of USD1,381 while in reality it is of USD3,591; meaning that the current prices are 160% higher than what they would have been if we use Dubai standards! Same logic applies for all other examples, so prices in Beirut should have been of USD2,357 instead of the current USD3,591 if we were to follow Montevideo’s levels (Uruguay is a country that we chose on purpose as it has many similarities with Lebanon, size of population for instance).
The conclusion of what was stated above is that current real estate prices in Lebanon are very high and unjustifiable, both in comparison with other countries in the world (countries that have much better economies, security, and stability) and also relative to what the people in Lebanon can afford.
Anonymous - Well basically the logic behind any market is very dependent on its economic freedom .Economic Auto regulation is a concept that theoretically Is only applicable in free markets . However maybe Lebanon is just closer to a medieval politico-economic-social even cultural structure very similar to feudalism where monopoly of the land was held by an elite ruling class . Demand and supply laws do not impact pricing in the case of monopolies. its all in the hand of the elite easing the tap when stability is beneficial for them and squeezing it when instability can be used for proper purposes.
Miranda - Excellent article, Wael. I am so frustrated by greedy landlords and the extortionate prices they demand. I make a good salary for this country, and yet have almost no disposable income left after my parasitic landlord extracts her pound of flesh. This is a good article from Al Akhbar; I thought you might like to read it http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/beirut-rich-only-average-1m-residential-apartment
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Thank you very much for your note Miranda. In addition, I want to thank you for the link you shared, very good article indeed; I enjoyed reading it.
Anonymous - This article is great and i can relate to it perfectly. Even though my income is decent, I still feel prices in the market are higher than what they should be and I'm very discouraged to buy. In some limited ways, what has held a bit the prices from falling further is the influx of Syrians who are also purchasing..but I see this as very temporary. The amount of "for sale" signs is the best indicator.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Thank you for your note. It is your words and people in situations like yours that drove me to do the research and to write the article in the first place. I am glad that you can relate to it. Like you, I believe the current situation is temporary and prices will eventually have to drop.
Jhony A. - Few new comments: The price of land is just a lagging amplified indicator of the prices of house as land itself cannot generate money returns usually except by holding and buying at a profit, or by construction on the property and selling of houses or other. Owners of land still price in a yearly appreciation of 25% in the price of constructed property, which is neither logical nor possible. Since land doesn't have maintenance cost, and value of a land doesn't depreciate contrary to built property and since money deposited in the banks still barely yields any interest, their prices will be sticky for a while but will follow at some point if house prices depreciate. The land scarcity problem is actually only an illusion created by the lack of decent infrastructure, and the special treatment that Beirut is getting comparing to any other part of Lebanon (in Electricity specially). This lack of infrastructure is also another reason why prices here in Lebanon are ridiculously high. Furthermore, the price of the square meter in all of Lebanon cannot be compared with the real estate of Lisbon for example. It will need to be compared with the price of real estate in Portugal as a whole. We can only but compare oranges to oranges. that's why we also need to take into consideration, that what developers market as a 120m2 place in lebanon is in fact smaller than a 100m2 in any other part of the world. As for Expats, we have two kinds. The first kind: Some actually went abroad to get a decent salary to afford a place in Lebanon. Many of them will never afford returning to Lebanon and continue to pay the mortgages they contracted, and as such will want to sell their property at some point. A few will be able to return after having set aside enough money to get rid of their mortgage, but might never regain their purchasing power they got used working outside of Lebanon. So all in all, only a few of those, will ever get back to Lebanon and stay. That's the way it was, that's the way it will always be. The second kind: They just invested in the real estate sector while it was booming. Some made a decent profit, some will sleep it over to the next round. GCC citizens real estate purchases have also different facets: There are the ones who purchase a summer house here. Except for the very rich of them, I think lots now consider lebanon a very expensive destination. Most of the Rich already have their multi-million place anyway. There is also the "investment" part of their involvement that is so similar to what happened in Dubai. They came in at low prices and got out at high prices. However, contrary to what happened in Dubai, Lebanese are stubborn and prefer to hold their houses waiting for the inflated prices they ask rather then sell at the price point where demand exists and is real. Furthermore, the influx of Syrians to Lebanon helped many developers by providing many purchase and rent opportunities that would have never existed anyway. And last, the Lebanese Central Bank is extending a seemingly easy monetary policy which allows people to overextend themselves to purchase property, policy that might bite both consumers and the local banks once interest rates start increasing. ( Loan Payments will increase for the all who are paying off their mortgage, but that increase will also impact local banks and the central bank who will still bear 60% of that interest rate increase.) Last but not least, while some developers are focusing on small real estate and realizing good sales, this is not a very sustainable as the purchasing power of the lower middle class and of the poor is rapidly deteriorating, with salaries constant and inflation very high. The only question they ask themselves before buying the house is: can i get the loan ? and yes they can because of the super easy lending policy. They don't ask the right question that is: Can I afford the load ? and no they can't because they are barely affording to pay it, because interest rates and their mortgate payment can only go up, and because there is no chance they will earn substantially more in the near future. Conclusion: Will the real estate market prices in Lebanon drop ? Only time will tell. What I can tell is that a 20 to 30% global drop in prices will give second wind to all the Lebanese economy. If that doesn't happen soon, the Lebanese economy will continue to suffer and might even experience excruciating pain until normal inflation catches up with the real estate prices or until everything crashes down spiralling out of control.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Thank you Jhony for your comment. You make a lot of valid points, and i agree with the majority of what you say. Most of all, it is your concluding remark that I like a lot: prices will have to drop, otherwise the whole economy might be looking at a really big problem in the near future (as if it needed more problems).
jad mouka - With that being said, add to it the lack of liquidity in the market and the fact that developers are paying contractors with apartments instead of cash money, i think we are heading into more and more inflation that eventually will pop. Lots of companies now working on the market, are working for apartments instead of cash. suppliers are most of the time giving credits facility more and more with delayed payments reaching up to 12 months. we have taken the saying "Walking on the edge" to a whole new level. Imagine what would happen if the currently being developed projects does not get sold, imagine if the demand halts to a total stop. the circle would fall apart. contracting will go bankrupt, suppliers will not get their money back, banks will not get their money back. The slightest devaluation of the real estate market will take us back to the dark ages with the lack of government investments and ability to hold the economy stable. We are looking into the real estate bubble that happened in the usa years ago with only one difference that the debts are not being traded in the share market which gave it the fast fall off, it is gonna be slow and painful. We are sitting on a time bomb.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Thank you Jad for your pertinent comment. You raise a lot of points that I will be talking about in my next article as i will tackle the effect of what is happening in real estate on the overall economy. I believe the real estate sector is putting the country at risk. Just look at the subsidies the central bank is giving through the loans and you can see that the situation is serious. Like you, I believe we are sitting on a time bomb (very well put).
tony - The price per m2 used is high. Many neighberhoods are much cheaper. The benchmarks themselves vary a lot between themselves. Dubai is just out of a bubble and cannot be used. Historically Lebanon has much more resilience than all benchmarks, plus we are not much higher ten our peers. Plus capacity is just and debt is limited in the sector. This article is at amateur level with all due respect.
Rich S - I have been seeing coming five years ago when our GDP improved in 2007. And prices increased quickly between 2008 and 2011. But to people who are counting on fuel and oil, just to let you know that if you look at Brazil which is a bigger country than us after the oil and the improve of their economy , the gap between the rich and poor have increased which due to corruption. Especially in a democratic country like Lebanon with a big time corruption this is what will happen. If we get our oil we will get more jobs but the wages will still be low and not enough to buy houses. Also if you consider our immigration it is in the peak right now and in the long run people who are looking for houses right now will back up and place it for sale, once they have kids in a different country because their kids won't come back which will also increase the supply. Either way we look at it it is a loosing situation in the long run.
Anonymous - This article failed to mention the land scarcity in Lebanon. THERE IS NO LANDLEFT IN LEBANON!! Beside , most of the apartments in Lebanon are owned by Lebanese expats. Moreover, land prices are higher than most of these countries that the writer mentioned, and that plays a big role in the price of real estate.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Thank you for your comment. Please refer to my earlier comment regarding the argument of land scarcity. I know this is a vastly used argument, but it doesn't matter how much land is left if you are pricing at a level which no one can afford (which is the case right now). First of all, prices will have to adjust to a level where transactions can occur (in order to have a market for the forces of demand and supply to interact) regardless of land scarcity; then we can talk about how much land is left and price it. jm, you make very good and valid points. Thank you.
jm - There is no land left in Central Beirut...If you go out of beirut the price per SQM stays high from 2000 up to 3500$...the writer is talking about the average price. in beirut the prices are at least 4500$ per SQM without mentioning that 70% of beirut consists of old buildings that are being demolished and reconstructed. So the land scarcity is not a valid argument
GBA - All this price for real estate and you don't even have proper electricity nor internet services?
Wael Abdul Rahm... - I know... how ironic... and some people claim that prices will go up even more, go figure!! Common sense and logic have died in this country.
SG S - It'd be good to understand the following while making an evaluation: loan ratios or average down payment, are the purchases reliant on prices increasing in the short term (Are people flipping houses?), the rental property market (are there even buildings that are rent only?), is the rental value enough to cover the payments on the loan? What is the liquidity position of the actual buyers? These are all important because if there is credit crunch, the price level will only be impacted if the buyers are in a liquidity bind. If however they can sit on it and have staying power, then they simply won't sell. Finally, what is the average sqm that can be afforded? Is new construction in Beirut for large apartments or small? What may happen is simply smaller units that are more affordable. That is what happened in Europe and the populated cities in the US.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Thank you for your comment. I will try to answer come of your questions: - around 6-7 years ago and earlier, people did not use to flip houses at all. However, recently, flipping houses has increased tremendously due to the illogical rise in prices of real estate. I personally know of people who own 12 apartments in Beirut (very much into flipping houses). I believe this is one more reason why prices will have to drop, as this is not real demand by people who want to live in these houses, but just specualtion - rental yields are very low, especially for big and expensive apartments. I would say, rental yields reach a maximum of 4 to 5%, but something around 2% is more accurate. And 2% is a very low rate (you are better off putting your money in the bank for 5% interest and capital guaranteed) - liquidity position is a case by case. Some buyers have the cash while others take loans. - In my opinion, the average price per sqm that makes sense and can be afforded should be around $2,000, if not less - New construction in Beirut is more skewed towards smaller apartments, which only makes sense, and which also proves that the prices are high and developers are looking for alternative ways to sell I hope this makes sense.
RA - Hello Wael , do you have any statistics about the finances of the speculators ? The people you know that own 12 appartments , did they take loans to purchase these assets or are they just very rich people looking to long hold those assets ? and do you know if it s the banks that are involved in holding assets in order to try and sustain real estate pricing. It might be interesting to explore that in another article no ? thank you
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Hi RA, thank you for your comment. You are absolutely right, you raise very important points through your questions, and they are definitely worth exploring in future articles. I hope I can gather enough data and information in order to write a useful article in that regard. Now let me answer your questions: It is extremely difficult to have statistics concerning the speculators as they are not defined as such in any database. However, from my personal experience, they are in general very wealthy; some of them buy with no debt, but the majority actually get loans (especially with the subsidies that the central bank is giving). However, it is important to note that regardless of the method of financing, very few buy these assets looking to hold them for a long time; in general they are looking to flip them quickly (within less than one year). Now for your last question regarding the banks' involvement in sustaining real estate pricing, I don't think that the banks are explicitly and intentionally trying to hold real estate assets; rather they are forced to do so in most cases (foreclosure for example). They don't want to hold real estate because most of them know that these are assets with depreciating value, and in the current situation, quite illiquid. I hope that was insightful, and thanks again for your constructive comment.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Finally, I wanted to thank you all for taking the time to leave your comments, which are all constructive and valuable.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - - Jad K. and Zee: you have similar comments that I hope to have addressed in my comment about the scarcity of land in Beirut and the effect of expats - SLC: the article mentions the prices in Beirut not Lebanon, and the source is duly mentioned (I have no input in these numbers). Agree with you on the role of the municipalities. As for your optimism for the future, I have to vehemently disagree. I find the current situation extremely bad, and getting even worse. I also believe that the vast majority of the people in Lebanon are very pessimistic about the country's situation which would put downward pressure on real estate prices. - RA: thank you for your comment. I think you are absolutely correct; and I might add that you can walk around Ras Beirut at night and easily notice that most of the new buildings are not lit (implying that most apartments are vacant); which confirms that there is no shortage of supply despite all the rhetoric about shortage of land - Elie: I love your comment! I agree totally with you, and this is what drove me to do the research about this topic and write this article. You wrote the most important sentence: "Prices are way unjustifiable" - Anonymous (3): can you please share with us how did you come up with the 15% figure? - Lebanese: Thank you for your comment. I totally hear you; and I wish that my humble article can make a change, even if a small one, in increasing awareness about this topic, and consequently in helping people in your situation.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Now, let me answer your individual comments: - Anonymous (1): Thank you for the comment - Julien: the price/m2 is taken from a source mentioned in the article. And I agree with you, the Lebanese way of calculating areas is often flawed (at least exaggerated) - Paul A.: I answered the scarcity of land in my previous comment. As for the other points you are making, i have to disagree as I see the situation as bad and worsening (definitely not improving). I believe the reply of Jhony A. is a very good one to your points. - Jhony A.: can't agree with you more. Your points are very valid, and I think the instability in Lebanon adds to the real estate bubble - Joe Sakr: I hope I have answered your points in my previous comment - Lost Lebanese; I agree with you 100%. You summarized most of my article in your comment - Anonymous (2): If invited, I will happily talk about this subject on TV - Tariq Aldowaisan: thank you for the comment. I don't know much about the situation in Kuwait but I hope it is not as bad as in Lebanon
Wael Abdul Rahm... - There are two points that were brought up in more than one comment that I would like to answer: 1. The effect of Lebanese expats. In fact, I agree that Lebanese expats account for some of the demand, and have largely contributed to the increase in real estate prices. However, I wanted to focus on the people living in Lebanon as they constitute the majority of demand, and ALL of REAL demand (they are the ones who will actually live in the apartments). 2. The scarcity of land in Beirut is a nice argument but it doesn't answer the real question and surely does not justify the sharp increase in prices. Let me explain: if you have 1 m2 or 1,000,000 m2 of land left, it has no effect if the asked price is above what everyone who wants to buy can pay. You must price your asset in a way that is affordable for the people who want to buy or no one will buy REGARDLESS of how much land is left.
Wael Abdul Rahm... - Thank you all for your comments. I will try to answer them all. I will also try to answer some of the issues that were mentioned in more than one comment.
frustrated leba... - For those of you talking about very little land left, let me state that if you compare the population increase vs the price increase you'll notice that the price increased much more than the increase in population. I mean for the last 5-6 years the population in lebanon did not increase from 4-5 million to 15 million did it?
Lebanese - This article speaks my heart. I am a young Lebanese citizen, engaged & current imaginary real state prices do not encourage me take any further steps in this country..
Anonymous - Can't agree with d author coz he didn't mention about d land price in Beirut wich is so high+ the time of construction from beginning to d end.so this period is so long n maximum d owner can get profit about 15% per year
Elie - I am not an economist nor do I pretend to have a thorough understanding of real estate but what I am certain of is that current pricing of real estate in Lebanon is fueled by the super greedy Lebanese mentality. Prices are way unjustifiable. I understand that there is a place for luxury apartments but the majority of new projects should not target this sector. In fact, the majority of the Lebanese cannot buy anything whether in Beirut or in the nearby suburbs. People are forced to take huge loans from banks or ask for their families help in order to get half decent apartments. Instead of pointing out the obvious lack of lands in Beirut to justify the ridiculous pricing one should ask for more scrutiny from state agencies regarding real estate and the charlatans running this sector.
Miranda - Well said, Elie. That's what has driven this bubble - unbridled greed. What we get charged to live in crummy apartments that need maintenance are not justifiable at all. All I am seeing in Hamra and on the Corniche are rows and rows of empty buildings. To me, this indicates an impending crash. Just as there was panic-buying at the start of this bubble, so there will also be panic-selling that brings prices back down to reasonable levels. Had there been regulation and property tax to keep the real estate profiteers in check, this would have happened much sooner. Hang in there; the crash is coming.
SLC - Good point to discuss . 1. Try to compare LEB to other countries with a very limited free land availability 2. Xpat/immigrant are almost triple the number of the current citizens living in lebanon 3. The average price per sqm in lebanon is 2300$ not 3591$ as mentioned .your numbers are based in beirut minor area 4. Prices is logically accepted comparing to the regions avg price. What I would like to highlite is that some of the projects in lebanon are not worth the asked price due to the bad execution and bad finishing .here I point finger on such project to be reevaluated by the Municipalties to take action or to aware the end user from paying the market price in these projects. Finally we are influenced and optimistic towards the natural resources process and requirements from foreign investments could grab a wild open opportunities in all means . GB
RA - Well even if we apply the average of 2300 Usd and base it on the purchasing power of a couple along with the existing rates (that are historically low and that have no way but up, making existing loans even more difficult to repay ), Each person in the couple should be making at least 3750 which is also much higher than the average salary in Lebanon. As for comparing to other countries , who s to say that prices aren't inflated there ? Excess liquidity and low interest rates worldwide caused by the quantitative easing policies made it easier for unsolvable couples to borrow and driving real estate prices unsustainably . Finally I don t know if most people commenting on this page about scarcity of supply actually noticed that on the metn highway coming towards Beirut there s not a single building ( yes not a single one) that doesn't have a vacancy advertised on it . and that's just one road in Lebanon. I think the real problem like almost everything else in Lebanon is the lack of a proper set of laws that would solve the issue, or even maybe that the will to solve it is simply not there.
Marwan El Kashef - The measures are totally different between Dubai and Beirut; the comparison should include the social trend, purchasing power, ratio of demands and supply.
Zee - The author did not mention what amount from the 700,000 USD that was mortgaged. Add to that, the author did not take into consideration the two most important factors when it comes to real estate in Lebanon. First, the shortage of land availability in Beirut. Two, the amount of Lebanese people living abroad and earning their income outside Lebanon who invest in properties in Lebanon and usually more than once.
Jad K. - Interesting article, however, as per the below comments, some factors are missing here. Need to take the following into account: scarcity of build-able land in the capital (Beirut); expatriates who are the majority of mid it high end apartments; demand vs supply of new projects. Those factors will push the prices upwards, versus the factors being stated which push downwards. In addition, not all people will be able to buy in the capital and this is normal, where there are other options like Bchamoun, khalde, martakla,,,,,, I believe the government should residents in such areas via managing the road networks, public transportation and building permits organization. This should be a National level discussion where representatives from government, buyers and sellers should discuss an overall strategy for the issue at hand.
Tariq Aldowaisan - Nice perspective on the skyrocketing prices in Beirut. I'm sure the situation in Kuwait is far worse, with over 110 thousands lining up to own their dream homes.
lost lebanese - Prices must drop. We will not buy one sqm in lebanon unless prices readjust by at least 30%... dont believe real estate agencies neither the fake real estate tv shows on some lebanese channels. How can some one with a 2000 dollars salary can buy a half a million dollars apartment..or shall we live on the street?
Joe Sakr - He has a point but he completely missed making reference to the wealthy Lebanese expats and other GCC citizens which combined constitute a big bulk of the buyers in Lebanon!
Fadi - It used to constitute, it is not anymore. They are currently selling not buying! All GCC owners are now selling their properties!
Paul A. - well what is being said is right theoretically but the fact that the situation in lebanon cannot be compared to other countried, it may be true that the prices r high and the situation in lebanon is unstable, but if you look at the area and the population in lebanon, you would change ur mind, since there not much land left to build on and the population is growing, the demand of apartments will rise which means the price will rise. and about the countries unstability .. i think its temporary and the economy will improve once natural resources are used properly (gas, oil and water). in my opinion, the prices will keep on rising.
Jhony A. - Oil and Gas? Look at Cyprus, and they are way ahead of us in the process of drilling for gas. Lack of Apartments? I only see empty apartments and For Sale Signs. Situation in Lebanon will get stable ? The more this unsustainable pricing continues, the more it will fuel unstability. There is no better reason for War than poverty. Even the US attacked Iraq just after one of their bad recessions.
Julien - I'm curious to know if the author made the calculation on the price per sqm the regular net way or the lebanese way (including common spaces, cave, parking spots, roof... and whatever can be put in) ? This dramatically changes the price per sqm
Answer to Julien - The Lebanese way includes the common spaces of the same floor but not cave, parking spots,... So I dont expect any considerable changes...
Answer to Answer - That's the official way which includes only the common spaces. But the marketing way, that's where things get ugly. most houses I have seen owners or developers want to sell as 200m2 at 2000$/m2 but when asked about the deed, it becomes a 170m2 and this still does include the common spaces so where did everything else come from ?

Today we have special guest author, Beverley Kendall with us. I originally became acquainted with Bev through her historical romance work, but she has since branched out to include more contemporary New Adult *woot*. Below she tell us a bit more about the difference between the “value” of a virgin bride, then vs. now.
Beverley: Not only do I now write new adult and adult contemporary romances, but I began my writing career writing historical romances.
Now I don’t know how many of you read historical romances but in that particular romance sub-genre virginity is a highly valued commodity in a bride. I’ll also note that it is highly valued in contemporary Harlequin Presents but beyond that, not so much.
Society has changed quite a bit in the last two centuries. At least in most developed countries. Divorce is the norm and women are waiting until they marry to have sex—men never were. Actually, 16.4 years is the average age that girls lose their virginity. Which means, Olivia, the heroine in WHEN IN PARIS… who is eighteen and still a virgin, is on the slightly older side of that average.
Olivia wouldn’t let her high school boyfriend pressure her into having sex with him and she doesn’t regret that but she does feel like she’s one of the very few in her graduating class who still has hers. Until she doesn’t. But she doesn’t give it away easily, although after she experiences it there’s no going back. To Olivia, sex is more than physical pleasure and I think she believes that the guy *cough* hero *cough* she gives it to should recognize that too.
Isalys: So I’m going to go out on a limb here and overshare. Sex for me has always been something incredibly personal and goes far beyond physical pleasure. It’s about a human connection and the intimacy shared between two people who deeply care for each other. It’s about creating a special kind of connection that not just anyone can have [with you]. I kissed my fair share of boys *yes, I was a total smooch whore* but when it came to sex, I was off limits. Until I fell in love…with the man that became my husband. (And yes, that means exactly what you think it means. I’m on a one-guy gal!) I have no problem with women who’ve had more than one partner, nor will I ever judge them, and I certainly don’t think a woman’s virginity should be part of her worth as a “female”. When, where, how, and why a woman has sex is her choice! However, because of my own personal experiences in life, I appreciate the heroine that is not so quick to give it up.
When I was in college, before my #1 came alone, I specifically remember having a conversation with a guy about exactly this. He mentioned wanting to meet a girl who was still a virgin (at approx 18-19 yrs old) and I remember thinking, “but what would he do with her?” Would he be kind and patient? Would he understand why she was still a virgin or go straight to finding fault with her?
What do you think: Do young men today believe that being given a girl’s virginity is something special? Or do they look at someone like our heroine Olivia, a very pretty eighteen-year-old, and wonder what’s wrong with her and why she still has it? And do your own personal experiences affect the kinds of heroes and heroines that you are most drawn to?
College freshman Olivia Montgomery is thrilled at the chance to start over, escape the rumors that plagued her in high school. And she can finally put her juvenile crush, Zachary Pearson, where he belongs—in her past. Then her unrequited love strolls into her French class, shattering Olivia’s newfound peace, and the feelings she'd thought buried for good come rushing back. Now she can't shake her unwanted attraction to the one guy who can twist her stomach into knots with just a smile...but has never given her the time of day.
Zach’s good looks may have always gotten him his pick of girls, but it's the star quarterback’s skill on the football field that gives him his pick of the Big Ten colleges. To escape the crushing demands of his win-at-all-costs father, Zach opts for a private university in upstate New York where...his present and past collide. And the one girl he’s always wanted but can’t have—and a class trip to Paris—turn out to be the ultimate game changer that has him breaking every one of his rules.

"When, where, how, and why a woman has sex is her choice!" I love that and I totally agree. Too much pressure is put on girls to have sex as soon as they're legally allowed and it's not worth giving into pressure if you'll regret it later. And I think it's sweet that Beverley Kendall has only ever been with her husband.
Sex has always been important. It's just our approach and openness about it that's changed over the centuries.
Once-upon-a-timek sex was a very private issue but today it's in just about everything we see/do. Girls had sex young then because it was the norm to get married earlier and life expectancy was shorter. Now, it's glorified for entirely different reasons so the pressure for young girls to engage in sex has only increased. I felt no such pressure but that's because I'm ridiculously stubborn and NO ONE was going to force me, lol.
Awesome question. I think it depends on how the woman treats her virginity and how the guy was raised.
I definitely dislike girls and book/tv/movie characters that just toss it around like it's something awful to get rid of.
I think it all depends on how a girl views what her virginity is worth but I also think it is the environment that they grow up in. As someone who waited until I has 18 to have sex I can say it is always a mixed reaction when people know that. I think guys don't think it is too weird until girls get to 20 to be honest. My friends could understand how come it didn't happen in highschool since I went to a small school. After I turned 18 and could legally drink (military overseas) and go to clubs I think it became expected to happen
Hi Isalys!! Thanks so much for having me on. Smooch! Love your ammendment to my post. It basically reflects my experience and views on virginity. I actually think reading romance novels made me more particular (although not enough given I'm divorced). LOL. But I always thought of it as something not to be shared with just anyone.
Hi Ayana, thanks for dropping by. :) Btw, that was Isalys who said she's only been with her husband.
I agree with Juju, it's definitely how you were raised and what your own personal feeling about it is. It is after all your body.
And waiting to save your self for someone whom you love and trust is a smart choice. Having sex means dealing with lots of hormones and feelings. Waiting until you're capable of handling them should be the norm.
Great post! Virginity doesn't seem to be such a value these days. I think it's important for a girl to wait to have sex with a partner who respects her and loves her, instead of having random sex to lose her virginity.
Hm, let me think, well I do feel like it's nothing special here. Sad really. Juts get it over with. I feel that it's more a bad thing, something to get over with. And if you wait you're weird.
It had nothing to do with religion. Nor did it stem from pressure--to lose or keep it. Rather, it was out of respect for myself. I refused to be with someone that way until I was certain I was with a guy I loved and respected, and who I felt returned both of those sentiments.
I don't think there is a wrong or right decision with regard to this issue. Rather, I feel it's a matter of having all the cards / having the knowledge necessary to make a choice that is right for YOU. Because it doesn't matter what a guy, or your parents, or the cliquey girls strutting down the halls thing. What YOU think and what YOU feel about your own sexuality should always be priority #1 in any discussion about it, especially of this nature.
No matter what time we live in, there will always be a sexual timeline that is en vogue--virginity was the hot thing for centuries, since it allowed men the ability to assure that the children in his home were legitimately his. This was important because of how properties, inheritances, etc. were passed down. In modern times we see an increased encouragement of sexuality because (1) we have genetics stuff that can test paternity, (2) the pendulum has swung in a very opposite direction, and (3) now that men don't need the results of female virginity to stake any sort of claim, it's in their best interest to encourage women to lose it younger. You don't think as clearly, you're struggling against media and peer pressure, etc.
My problem with all of this--past and present--is that left to its own devices, Virginity is not about a woman's choice. It's actually an idealism, a catch all phrase like "clingy", that people can throw around in different ways depending on what suits their needs. There is no honour or respect associated with it; it's a word for something that doesn't technically exist and yet that we allow ourselves to feel guilt over: whether that guilt pressures us to hold it or throw it away.
Tell me, people: when's the last time you seriously heard virginity used as something to encourage a woman to decide, of her own accord, when SHE is ready for sex? As an ideal, I can empathize with people feeling pressure one way or another. But as someone who chose to wat while living in a society that actively pressures us to purge it like it's a disease, it really brings to mind that line from "Won't Be Fooled Again" by The Who:
Regardless of what we're being told to do with virginity, there is a constant in that we ARE being told what to do with it, rather then being respected to make a choice right for us as individuals. Until that changes, it's the same problem with different faces, no matter how you look at it.
I hate to say it, but I think the norm is to question why a girl would still be a virgin at 20. but I love a girl that is confident enough to answer that question w/out feeling she should apologize. Thanks for the great discussion.
I think it depends on the values that the guy and girl have as to how virginity is perceived. Your book sounds good.
I think that nowadays, guys think "what is wrong with this chick" if they know she's still a virgin. , especially if they are older. I'm going on 32 this year and still a virgin. I think, like Isalys, that sex should be more than just physical pleasure. There has to be a deeper meaning that just that. I like heroines who wait to have that special deeper meaning between her and her partner than just give it up because she thinks the guy is hot.
I was 32 years old when I lost my virginity. It was on my wedding night to my hubby. He wanted to wait till then (it wasn't easy, I'll tell you that much :) )but he thought it be very special, And it was. Had opportunity through the years but really wanted to wait for when I found that special someone I would fall in love with.
It such a special and intimate experience; physically, emotionally and spiritually. I have no regrets.
I have three teenagers (15 yr old beautiful daughter and 16 and 17 yr old handsome boys) and all three are virgins and wanting to wait for that special some also. They have friends who have decided not to wait and seen a lot of hurt and heartache. But they also have friends who are choosing to wait and see how happy and content they are with their decision. I think that the slowly, virginity is making a comeback.Sex is something special and to be valued as a very special experience with that special someone.
In the end it every individuals own choice. But boy am I glad I remained a virgin for the love of my life and he valued it as a very special girl.
I'm way out of the loop on the current generation of adolescents/young adults, though I have seen plenty of evidence that many of them (both sexes) are extremely casual about sex, especially by the time they're in their early twenties.

The Earliest records of the use of gold for medicinal and healing purposes came from Alexandria, Egypt. The Egyptians ingested Gold for mental, bodily and spiritual purification over 5,000 years ago. They believed that gold will stimulate the life force and raising the level of vibration on all levels.
in Medieval times Gold was often seen as beneficial for health, it is believed that something rare and beautiful could not do any harm instead it can but can only provide health benefits.
Although Gold can be an alternative medicine, only Gold Salts and radioisotopes of gold are of pharmacological value, as elemental (metallic) gold has no therapeutic action to all chemicals it encounters inside the body.
As of today, gold injections have been proven to help to reduce the pain and swelling of rheumatoid arthritis and tuberculosis.
~Began at the end of the 19th century, Gold compounds that accumulate slowly in the body and in overtime reduce inflammation related to rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriatic arthritis, membranous nephritis, lupus erythematosus and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.

While using Verizon Fios fanduel promos for buying its products certain things are to be considered. These coupon codes come with time limits. That is it can be used only for a particular time period. At times they can be used for purchasing only certain products and services of Verizon Fios. So, one has to look for the limitations of a fanduel promo before buying it. The usage of a coupon issued by Fios varies from buying a new phone or getting a new internet connection to setting a new ring tone in your phone. The major reason why the company issues coupon codes is that it is a method of advertising. This will bring them more sales and thereby more profits. Thus it is not the customers alone who benefit from this but the company as well.

The main event was pretty dumb again this year. I played great and had my table image honed in and got a guy to stick KQo in preflop when I had aces but for the second year in a row I didn't win (at least last year I got half the pot when the board flushed and neither of us had the suit). I then got AJ in vs a small stack with 88 on a AJT8 board for most of the rest of my chips, and busted out with a very small stack with A7s vs KK.
It really is incredible how soft of a tourney the main event is and given that it's a little disappointing that none of the players I had pieces of did anything notable. I'm not disappointing in them at all of course, but just how dumb big live tourneys are luck/variance wise. Almost everyone had a sick couple of hands they lost.
After Vegas I headed to San Diego again. I've always wanted to golf when I'm out there and we've always kinda talked about it but never followed through. I decided to buy clubs out there so I'll be more motivated to play when I'm there and hopefully we'll golf enough that it'll cover all the fees of renting clubs and playing with rentals kinda sucks anyhow. I've never had nice clubs before and man did I find some I really liked by more or less getting lucky at the store I think. I'm not the hugest fan of the 3wood/fairway wood I got but the iron set (mizuno rx-25's) are awesome. I wasn't planning on it, but now I think I'll have to pick up a set for here in MN, too.
Dave also bought clubs, so we golfed 3 days in a row. I shot my best round ever -an 81 which is kind of bogus cause i had 2 4-putts and a couple others that I really felt should have dropped. I'm gonna play a ton here back in MN and hopefully soon break 80. I think it's time I find a driver I like and work on it. For the past 3 years I've just stuck to a 3 wood cause I can hit it like 230 down the middle most of the time and that's generally good enough cause it keeps me out of trouble. Now it's time to take it to the next level.
Changing topics...I've always loved screwing around in the ocean if there are decent waves. It really makes me feel young again getting just owned by them and it's so fun. Maybe I should try to learn to surf sometime.

The history of the United States is substantial and also complex, yet can be broken down into moments and periods that separated, merged, as well as transformed the United States into the country it is today. The American flag didn’t appear like it does now. Apart from that, it underwent a lot of adjustments and alterations.
Enter the American Revolution. Sometimes referred to as the American War of Independence, or the Revolutionary War, it was a conflict which lasted from 1775-1783 and also allowed the original 13 colonies to remain independent from Great Britain. Starting in Great Britain in the late 1790s, the Industrial Revolution ultimately made its path to the United States and also changed the emphasis of the nation’s economy and also the way it manufactures items.
For more than 10 years prior to the episode of the revolution in 1775, conflict had been building between colonists as well as the British authorities. These stress arose from expanding tensions in between residents of Great Britain’s 13 North American colonies as well as the colonial government (which represented the British crown). Attempts by the British government to elevate profits by taxing the colonies (notably the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Tariffs of 1767 and the Tea Act of 1773) consulted with heated objection amongst several colonists, who disliked their absence of depiction in Parliament and also demanded the exact same legal rights as other British citizens. Colonial resistance brought about violence in 1770, when British soldiers opened fire on a mob of colonists, killing five people in just what was called the Boston Massacre. After December 1773, when a band of Bostonians dressed as Mohawk Indians boarded British ships and discarded 342 containers of tea right into Boston Harbor, an annoyed Parliament passed a series of actions (referred to as the Intolerable, or Coercive Acts) created to reassert imperial authority in Massachusetts.
George Washington was made its leader. Congress wished they could force the British to negotiate yet George III rejected to compromise. Instead, in August 1775 he proclaimed that all the American colonies were in a state of disobedience.
By June 1776, with the Revolutionary War in full swing, a growing bulk of the colonists had actually come to prefer freedom from Britain. That same year Richard Henry Lee of the Virginia Assembly offered Congress with resolutions stating the self-reliance of the colonies, requiring a confederation as well as shared the have to find foreign allies for a war against Britain. On July 4th, the Continental Congress voted to embrace the Declaration of Independence, drafted by a five-man committee consisting of Franklin and John Adams yet composed generally by Jefferson. By the autumn of 1781, the American forces had begun to compel the opponent to withdraw to Virginia’s Yorktown peninsula, near where the York River clears right into Chesapeake Bay. Supported by a French army commanded by General Jean Baptiste de Rochambeau, Washington moved against Yorktown with a total of around 14,000 soldiers, while a fleet of 36 French battleships offshore prevented British support or escape. Trapped and also overpowered, the enemy was compelled to surrender their whole military. Claiming illness, the British general sent his deputy, Charles O’Hara, to surrender; after O’Hara came close to Rochambeau to surrender his sword (the Frenchman deferred to Washington), Washington gave the nod to his very own deputy, Benjamin Lincoln, who accepted it. After French assistance helped the Continental Army force the British abandonment at Yorktown, Virginia, in 1781, the Americans had actually effectively won their freedom, though combatting would certainly not formally end until 1783.
The motion for American independence successfully triumphed at Yorktown, modern observers did not see that as the crucial victory. British armies stayed posted around Charleston, as well as the effective major military still resided in New York. The British exit of their soldiers from Charleston and also Savannah in late 1782 lastly pointed to the end of the dispute. British and also American mediators in Paris authorized initial peace terms in Paris late that November, and also on September 3, 1783, Great Britain formally identified the independence of the United States in the Treaty of Paris. At the same time, Britain authorized different peace treaties with France as well as Spain (which had gotten in the dispute in 1779), bringing the American Revolution to a close after eight long years.
The American flag was made to stand for the new union of the thirteen initial states: it would have thirteen stripes, alternating red and also white, as well as thirteen stars, white on a blue field. Among the very first flags had the stars laid out in a circle, based upon the idea that colonies were equal. The thirteen stripes, laid out side by side, stood for the battle for independence; red meant valiance, white signified pureness and blue represented loyalty.
In 1818, after a couple of style adjustments, the United States Congress decided to maintain the flag’s initial thirteen stripes and include brand-new stars to show each brand-new state that got in the union.
While there is no doubt that the actual Betsy Ross deserved interest in her own right, it is the legend of Betsy stitching the initial stars and stripes that has made her a remarkable historical number. The Betsy Ross tale was given spotlight in 1870 by her grandson, William Canby, in a speech he made to the Historical Society of Pennsylvania. Canby and also various other participants of Betsy’s household authorized sworn affidavits mentioning that they heard the story of the production of the initial flag from Betsy’s very own mouth.
According to the oral history, in 1776, three men – George Washington, Robert Morris, as well as George Ross, saw Betsy Ross in her furniture shop. She escorted them to her parlor, where they can have a private meeting. Here, Washington took a folded paper from his inside coat pocket. On it, was a drawing of a flag with thirteen red as well as white stripes and also thirteen 6-pointed stars.
Washington asked if Betsy can make a flag from the layout. Betsy responded: “I don’t know, yet I will certainly attempt.” This line was used in the sworn statements of numerous of Betsy’s household members, recommending that it is a straight quote from Betsy. As the story goes, Betsy suggested transforming the stars to 5 points rather than 6.
Some historians think that it was Francis Hopkisnon who offered birth to the suggestion of the Stars and Stripes. Francis Hopkinson was a preferred patriot, a lawyer, a Congressman from New Jersey, an endorser of the Declaration of Independence, poet, artist, and distinguished civil servant.
He was designated to the Continental Navy Board on November 6,1776. It was while working on the Continental Navy Board that he transformed his attention to creating the flag of the United States. The use of stars because style is thought to have actually been the result of an experience in the war straightly related to his propriety.
A publication in Hopkinson’s collection at his residence in Bordentown was taken by a Hessian soldier in December 1776, a dark year of the war. The soldier, one I. Ewald, composed on the inside cover that he had seen the author near Philadelphia as well as that he, Ewald, had actually taken the publication from a fine nation seat near Philadelphia. The soldier had written over as well as listed below Hopkinson’s bookplate, which had three 6 pointed stars and his family adage, “Semper Paratus”, or “Always Ready”.
In a letter to the Board of Admiralty in 1780 Hopkinson asserted that he had actually created “the flag of the United States of America” along with a number of ornaments, devices, and checks appearing on bills of exchange, ship papers, the seals of the boards of Admiralty as well as Treasury, and also the Great Seal of the United States. Hopkinson had gotten absolutely nothing for this work, and currently he sent a bill and also asked “whether a Quarter Cask of the public wine” would certainly not be a sensible as well as proper incentive for his labors.
Even so, no one can be so certain who produced the American flag. The American flag is the spiritual symbol of the country. It signifies the residents’ birthright, their heritage of freedom purchased with blood as well as sadness. The title deed of freedom, which is the country’s to delight in and also hold in trust for posterity. Everlasting watchfulness is the price of freedom. As you see the flag silhouetted in front of the calm skies of the country, you are reminded that the American flag represents just what you are – no more, no much less.

They, Vimeo and others do have advertising and marketing that might distract from and also even compete with your video clips. Online video platforms can be an excellent investment that offers you better branding choices and complete innovative control.
It is necessary to add your URL into your video. It is relatively very easy to add a text box to your video clip, and also this text box need to have details like your LINK as well as the name of your website. This helps make it simpler for video audiences to discover your internet site.
Don’t fail to remember to include your LINK within your videos. You can do this through making use of a text box on your video. This is a great way to allow people know where they can visit find brand-new information and items. If you don’t consist of the URL, they’ll watch as well as forget you.
Incorporate your video clip advertising and marketing initiatives with social advertising. After you upload your video clip, reveal it in your Facebook account as well as tweet about it on Twitter.
Your video marketing project may help your company be successful in a myriad of ways. Gaining an on the internet existence as well as credibility are simply a couple of means. http://www.whiteboardanimationshop.com/how-to-use-whiteboard-animations-in-four-creative-ways/ imaginative way to use computer animation videos Create a solid plan as well as try out a video advertising project. Your business will reap all of the incentives.
You must utilize any sort of advantage you can find in terms of advertising methods, including the consumption of videos. While it could be a little challenging to convince someone that the individuals in your video are absolutely fans of you and also your items, it comes throughout much better than constantly doing video clips alone.
In video marketing you have a really short time structure to catch your customers attention. A major error of people new to video clip marketing is they try to make their video clips like a commercial. Integrate your video marketing efforts with social advertising.

Commentary re The Hill written by Devin Hughes is president of GVPedia, a comprehensive resource providing public access to research on gun violence. Beth Roth is co-founder of Children’s Firearm Safety Alliance and executive director of Safe Tennessee Project; Jen Pauliukonis is executive director of GVPedia and Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence.
In his op-ed on May 24, pro-gun commentator John Lott contends that Child Access Prevention (CAP) laws will cost lives and that making guns more readily accessible is the answer to gun violence. The opposite is true. Significant evidence shows that CAP laws save lives, and the defensive gun use myth fuels even more gun violence.
Lott’s article is riddled with fabrications and falsehoods. For example, he opines that “every place in the world that has banned guns has seen an increase in murder.” Yet Japan is the developed nation that has come closest to completely banning firearms, and it has seen its homicide rate fall more than 75 percent since it adopted its ban in 1958. While correlation is not causation, Lott’s correlative claim is unmistakably false. Further, a 2013 study found that among developed nations, more guns per capita was associated with significantly higher rates of firearm deaths.
Lott’s most glaring errors, though, surround the core theses that safe storage would cost lives by preventing defensive gun use and that unintentional child shootings are rare, with those that do occur being the result of criminal adults.
Although Lott correctly notes that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show an average of 59 children are unintentionally shot and killed each year, he fails to disclose that researchers have conclusively revealed that this number is a significant underestimate. The CDC readily admits that its estimate is low, so using this number can only be a tactic to minimize these deaths. A 2013 New York Times investigation found that fewer than half of unintentional shootings of children were recorded as such (often being mislabeled as homicides). And a more recent 2016 Associated Press and USA Today report found more than 1,000 deaths and injuries from unintentional shootings from Jan. 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016, 90 of whom were 3-year-olds.
The Children’s Firearm Safety Alliance compiles unintentional child shootings that result from negligent storage. In 2016, 120 children ages 0-17 were killed and 175 injured. In 2017, 132 children were killed and 216 injured — all as a result of a child gaining access to an irresponsibly stored firearm. Between 2016 and May 26, 2018, 137 toddlers — between the ages of zero and three — picked up a loaded, unsecured gun and pulled the trigger, resulting in the deaths of 51 children and two adults, and injuring 74 children and nine adults.
Lott opines that “relatively few accidental gunshots take place in law-abiding, normal homes; most accidental gunshots resulting in the deaths of minors are fired by adult males in their mid-to-late 20s who have criminal histories.” This is an outright fabrication.
National Violent Death Reporting System data compiled by the Harvard Injury Control Research Center reveal that from 2003-2006, two-thirds of fatal unintentional shootings of children under the age of 14 were committed by other children. When self-inflicted unintentional deaths are included, the figure rises to 74 percent.
Lott’s outdated, solitary study claiming that CAP laws increase crime relies extensively on dubious econometric practices. More reliable research reveals that not only does firearm prevalence endanger children, but that strong CAP laws also help mitigate this risk and save lives. These laws help reduce both unintentional shootings and youth firearm suicides.
Lott’s research is also predicated on the myth that defensive gun use (DGU) is widespread and effective. Neither is the case. While small private surveys indicate there are approximately 2.5 million cases of DGU annually, they suffer from significant false positives and other methodological problems that render their estimates unusable. Instead, the best available empirical data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive reveal there are fewer than 2,100 verified DGUs annually. Further, Harvard research indicates that in the rare circumstance a firearm is used in self-defense, it is no more effective at preventing injury than doing nothing.
Further, the failure to store firearms securely is making it even easier for criminals to obtain firearms. More than 200,000 firearms are stolen from gun owners each year, and research shows that more gun ownership increases levels of overall burglary.
It is important to note that this isn’t an either-or situation. For gun owners who do feel the need to have firearms readily available for the exceedingly rare circumstance of self-defense, plenty of gun safes allow for rapid deployment yet keep the firearm secure at all other times. Self-defense is not a legitimate excuse for jeopardizing the safety of loved ones or allowing even more firearms to hit America’s streets.
Lott’s proposals encourage irresponsible gun ownership that would result in more dead children, gun theft, and violence on America’s streets.
We tailor our inspections to your specific needs and enable you to balance excitement and challenge with robust safety procedures.
Our experience has sadly been that too often Local Authorities and other playground managers feel pressurised into unnecessary expenditure by poor inspections. Please see our publication “Poor Playground Inspection Reports Leading to Wasteful Expenditure”. Cheaper inspections can cost more in the long run.
We take great care to ensure that our advice is carefully prioritised so that valuable resources are spent on necessary repairs or modifications and that unnecessary expenditure is avoided.
Our enhanced “Playground Audits” assess the following and give ratings so that comparisons can be made:
Social Safety – Will children or single parents feel safe using the playground? What usage does it receive and how could this be improved?
Development Potential – Is what’s on offer appropriate for the likely usage and potential catchment?
Rob Wheway, our principal consultant, also specialises in the inspection of bespoke or “natural” play areas. As part of the service he offers advice at pre-installation and design stages so that unnecessary problems can be avoided at an early stage.

Anyone involved in the computer industry likely spends some amount of time reading about the latest security issues in books such as Security for Web Developers. Administrators and developers probably spend more time than many people, but no one can possibly read all the security research available today. There are so many researchers looking for so many bugs in so many places and in so many different ways that even if someone had the time and inclination to read every security article produced, it would be impossible. You’d need to be the speediest reader on the planet (and then some) to even think about scratching the surface. So, you must contemplate the usefulness of all that research—whether it’s actually useful or simply a method for some people to get their name on a piece of paper.
Some of the attacks require physical access to the system. In some cases, you must actually take the system apart to access components in order to perform the security trick. Unless you or your organization is in the habit of allowing perfect strangers physical access to your systems, which might include taking them apart, you must wonder whether the security issue is even worth worrying about. You need to ask why someone would take the time to document a security issue that’s nearly impossible to see, much less perform in a real world environment. More importantly, the moment you see that a security issue requires physical access to the device, you can probably stop reading.
You also find attacks that require special equipment to perform. The article, How encryption keys could be stolen by your lunch, discusses one such attack. In fact, the article contains a picture of the special equipment that you must build to perpetrate the attack. It places said equipment into a piece of pita bread, which adds a fanciful twist to something that is already quite odd and pretty much unworkable given that you must be within 50 cm (19.6 in) from the device you want to attack (assuming that the RF transmission conditions are perfect). Except for the interesting attack vector (using a piece of pita bread), you really have to question why anyone would ever perpetrate this attack given that social engineering and a wealth of other attacks require no special equipment, are highly successful, and work from a much longer distance.
Another example of incredibly weird security research is found in the article, When the good guys are wielding the lasers. I have to admit it’s interesting in a James Bond sort of way, but we’re talking about lasers mounted on drones. This attack at least has the advantage of distance (1 km or 0.6 mi). However, you have to wonder just how the laser was able to get a line of sight with the attack object, a printer in this case. If a device is critical enough that someone separates it from the Internet, it’s also quite likely that the device won’t be sitting in front of a window where someone can use a laser to access it.
A few research pieces become more reasonable by discussing outlandish sorts of hacks that could potentially happen after an initial break-in. The hack discussed in Design flaw in Intel chips opens door to rootkits is one of these sorts of hacks. You can’t perpetrate the hack until after breaking into the system some other way, but the break-in has serious consequences once it occurs. Even so, most hackers won’t take the time because they already have everything needed—the hack is overkill.
The articles that help most provide a shot of reality into the decidedly conspiracy-oriented world of security. For example, Evil conspiracy? Nope, everyday cyber insecurity, discusses a series of events that everyone initially thought pointed to a major cyber attack. It turns out that the events occurred at the same time by coincidence. The article author thoughtfully points out some of the reasons that the conspiracy theories seemed a bit out of place at the outset anyway.
It also helps to know the true sources of potential security issues. For example, the articles, In the security world, the good guys aren’t always good and 5 reasons why newer hires are the company’s biggest data security risk, point out the sources you really do need to consider when creating a security plan. These are the sorts of articles that should attract your attention because they describe a security issue that you really should think about. Likewise, reading articles such as, Software developers aren’t implementing encryption correctly and 4 fatal problems with PKI help you understand why your security measures may not always work as well as anticipated.
The point is that you encounter a lot of information out there that doesn’t help you make your system any more secure. It may be interesting if you have the time to read it, but the tactics truly aren’t practical and no hacker is going to use them. Critical thinking skills are your best asset when building your security knowledge. Let me know about your take on security research at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
There is a myth among administrators and developers that it’s possible to keep a machine free of viruses, adware, Trojans, and other forms of malware simply by disconnecting it from the Internet. I’m showing my age (yet again), but machines were being infected with all sorts of malware long before the Internet became any sort of connectivity solution for any system. At one time it was floppy disks that were the culprit, but all sorts of other avenues of attack present themselves. To dismiss things like evil USB drives that take over systems, even systems not connected to the Internet, is akin to closing your eyes and hoping an opponent doesn’t choose to hit you while you’re not looking. After all, it wouldn’t be fair. However, whoever said that life was fair or that anyone involved in security plays by the rules? If you want to keep your systems free of malware, then you need to be alert and scrutinize them continually.
Let’s look at this issue another way. If you refused to do anything about the burglar rummaging around on the first floor while you listened in your bedroom on the second floor, the police would think you’re pretty odd. More importantly, you’d have a really hard time getting any sort of sympathy or empathy from them. After all, if you just let a burglar take your things while you blithely refuse to acknowledge the burglar’s presence, whose fault is that? (Getting bonked on the back of the head while you are looking is another story.) That’s why you need to monitor your systems, even if they aren’t connected to the Internet. Someone wants to ruin your day and they’re not playing around. Hackers are dead serious about grabbing every bit of usable data on your system and using it to make your life truly terrible. Your misery makes them sublimely happy. Really, take my word for it.
The reason I’m discussing this issue is that I’m still seeing stories like, “Chinese hacker group among first to target networks isolated from Internet.” So, what about all those networks that were hacked before the Internet became a connectivity solution? Hackers have been taking networks down for a considerable time period and it doesn’t take an Internet connection to do it. The story is an interesting one because the technique used demonstrates that hackers don’t have to be particularly good at their profession to break into many networks. It’s also alarming because some of the networks targeted were contractors for the US military.
There is no tool, software, connection method, or secret incantation that can protect your system from determined hackers. I’ve said this in every writing about security. Yes, you can use a number of tools to make it more difficult to get through and to dissuade someone who truly isn’t all that determined. Unfortunately, no matter how high you make the walls of your server fortress, the hacker can always go just a bit further to climb them. Headlines such as “Advanced Attackers go Undetected for a Median of 229 Days; Only One-Third of Organizations Identify Breaches on Their Own” tell me that most organizations could do more to scrutinize their networks. Every writing I read about informed security is that you can’t trust anyone or anything when you’re responsible for security, yet organizations continue to ignore that burglar on the first floor.
There is the question of whether it’s possible to detect and handle every threat. The answer is that it isn’t. Truly gifted hackers will blindside you can cause terrifying damage to your systems every time. Monitoring can mitigate the damage and help you recover more quickly, but the fact is that it’s definitely possible to do better.

Windows XP, the operating system that simply refuses to die. The title of this post should tell you that there have been four other posts (actually a lot more than that) on the death of Windows XP. The last post was on 30 May 2014, Death of Windows XP? (Part 4). I promised then that it would be my last post, but that’s before I knew that Windows XP would still command between 10 percent and 15 percent market share—placing it above the Mac’s OS X. In fact, according to some sources, Windows XP has greater market share than Windows 8.1 as well. So it doesn’t surprise me that a few of you are still looking for Windows XP support from me. Unfortunately, I no longer have a Windows XP setup to support you, so I’m not answering Windows XP questions any longer.
Apparently, offering Windows XP support is big business. According to a recent ComputerWorld article, the US Navy is willing to pony up $30.8 million for Microsoft’s continued support of Windows XP. Perhaps I ought to reconsider and offer paid support after all. There are many other organizations that rely on Windows XP and some may shock you. For example, the next time you stop in front of an ATM, consider the fact that 95 percent of them still run Windows XP. In both cases, the vendors are paying Microsoft to continue providing updates to ensure the aging operating system remains secure. However, I’m almost certain that even with security updates, hackers have figured out ways to get past the Windows XP defenses a long time ago. For example, even with fixes in place, it’s quite easy to find headlines such as, “Hackers stole from 100 banks and rigged ATMs to spew cash.”
What worries me more than anything else is that there are a lot of home users out there who haven’t patched their Windows XP installation in a really long time now. Their systems must be hotbeds of viruses, adware, and Trojans. It wouldn’t surprise me to find that every one of them is a zombie spewing out all sorts of garbage. It’s time to put this aging operating system out of its misery. If you have a copy of Windows XP, please don’t contact me about it—get rid of it and get something newer. Let me know your thoughts on ancient operating systems at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
I’ve gotten used to a whole lot of silly vendor tricks over the years. Just about every vendor I’ve worked with has done something completely idiotic, just to cause the other guy woe. The user always ends up hurt. Readers of Administering Windows Server 2008 Server Core, Microsoft Windows Command Line Administration Instant Reference, and Windows 8 for Dummies Quick Reference need to be aware that according to a ComputerWorld article, Samsung has turned off Windows Update. The worrisome part of all this is that there is apparently an executable to turn the support off, but not another executable to turn support back on. Sites, such as engadget, are recommending you perform a clean install of Windows on your computer to get rid of the problem.
The whole issue seems to revolve around Samsung being worried that Microsoft’s updates will interfere with Samsung’s updates of its software. The result could be that the system won’t work. Phrases, such as “could be” and “might not”, always bother me. Samsung must not have tested the problem fully or they would have had a more positive and straightforward comment to make when asked about the problem. The point is that the user loses. Advice such as telling users they must reinstall Windows from scratch to get rid of the problem sounds just dandy until you figure out that most users can’t perform this task, so they’ll be out extra money getting someone else to do the job or we’ll all face the issues that happen when updates don’t occur. It’s not as if the Internet really requires yet more zombies (computers under hacker control)—we have no lack of them now.
A similar problem occurred not long ago when Lenovo thought it would be a good idea to pre-install the Superfish adware on the computers it put out. Most computer vendors add bloatware to their systems, which really does make it a good idea to perform a clean install when you buy a new system, but purposely adding adware seems a bit deranged to me. Lenovo later apologized and fixed the problem, but the point is that they made the mistake in the first place.
Some of my readers have asked why so many of my books include installation instructions or at least pointers to the installation instructions. The answer is that vendors keep doing things that make me shake my head and wonder just what they were thinking about. When you buy a new system from someone, perform a clean install of the operating system to get rid of the bloatware or have someone else do it for you. If you choose to keep the pre-installed operating system in place, make sure you research any oddities of the installation (such as turning off Windows Update). Otherwise, you might end up with a situation where Windows Update simply doesn’t do the job because someone told it not to. Let me know your thoughts on pre-installed software, bloatware, and vendors who seem completely clueless at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
According to a ComputerWorld article, Samsung will end the practice of disabling Windows Update. Of course, one has to wonder why they did it in the first place. If you have one of the systems that disabled Windows Update, a patch will restore the system to perform the required updates.
Some time back, I created the Adding a Location to the Windows Path blog post to help readers make better use of some of my book examples. Adding a location to the path makes it possible for Windows to locate applications with greater ease. However, that post didn’t make it clear that a space in a path would cause problems. For example, a path such as, C:\Windows; C:\Python33 (note the space) won’t work. In order for the path to work, each individual path must be separated from the others with just a semicolon, such as C:\Windows;C:\Python33. If you’ve added a path to your Windows setup and find that Windows can’t locate the applications you want to use, please check for an unwanted space in the path.
The limitation on using spaces in a path makes sense because you also have to restrict their use at the command line. For example, typing Dir /A D (with a space between the A and the D) will produce an error. In order to obtain the correct results, you must type Dir /AD and press Enter. The reason the space causes a problem is because the command processor treats spaces as a delimiter, a separator between command elements. The space tells the command processor that one element has ended and a new one has started.
Spaces can creep into commands with relative ease. All it takes is a relatively simple tap on the spacebar at the wrong time. In addition, spaces can be hard to spot when you use certain fonts. When working in an editor to create batch files or other permanently stored command forms, always use a mono-space font, such as Courier New, to make spaces easier to spot. The point is to look for unwanted spaces when a command line feature doesn’t work properly and you know you have typed the correct command.
As a reminder from my books, the command line can also be case sensitive in some cases. Make sure you check your commands to ensure they’re formatted correctly. Let me know about your book-specific command line issue at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
I maintain statistics about each of my books. Lately, I’ve noticed a trend with my command line reference books. More people are sending me e-mail about Microsoft Windows Command Line Administration Instant Reference and Administering Windows Server 2008 Server Core. However, the questions are becoming more diverse and less technical. Rather than the targeted questions about administration needs, I’m getting what I think are probably power user questions as well. People see my blog posts about commands, such as FindStr, and they naturally want to know more.
Someone recently wrote to ask me about what I thought the trends regarding the command line are. Based on my statistics, I would think that administrators are continuing to use the command line and more power users are rediscovering the command line. However, basing an opinion solely on book-related e-mail isn’t always the best idea and it certainly isn’t very scientific. Statistically, the e-mail is probably skewed to some extent because people aren’t speaking in general about their feelings—they have specific questions.
So, today I come to you with a request. Could you either comment to this blog post or send me e-mail about how you use the command line, or whether you use it at all? Microsoft is doing everything it can to move people to PowerShell. You can do quite a lot with PowerShell, including writing scripts that are more robust than those you can write at the command line. In addition, there are sites, such as PowerShell.com, that cater to the needs of the PowerShell user.
Even though it would seem at first like PowerShell is the future and the command line is passé, the command line has the advantage of simplicity and long term stability. In addition, there are still more resources available for the command line than there are for PowerShell. I generally use the command line for all my needs because I simply haven’t had a need for the additional resources that PowerShell provides. Let me know your thoughts about the command line and whether you generally see PowerShell as the required replacement for it at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
The last post, Death of Windows XP? (Part 3), was supposed to be the last word on this topic that won’t die, but as usual, it isn’t. The hackers of the world have figured out a new an interesting way of getting around Microsoft’s plan to kill Windows XP. It turns out that you can continue to get updates if you’re willing to use a registry hack to convince Windows Update that your system is a different version of Windows that is almost like Windows XP Service Pack 3, but not quite. You can read the article, How to get security updates for Windows XP until April 2019, to get the required details.
The hack involves making Windows Update believe that you actually own a Point of Sale (POS) system that’s based on Windows XP. The POS version of Windows XP will continue to have support until April of 2019, when it appears that Windows XP will finally have to die unless something else comes along. It’s important to note that you must have Windows XP Service Pack 3 installed. Older versions of Windows XP aren’t able to use the hack successfully.
After reading quite a few articles on the topic and thinking through the way Microsoft has conducted business in the past, I can’t really recommend the registry hack. There are a number of problems with using it that could cause issues with your setup.
The updates aren’t specifically tested for the version of Windows XP that you’re using, so you could see odd errors pop up.
Microsoft could add code that will trash your copy of Windows XP (once it figures out how to do so).
There are probably other reasons not to use the hack, but these are the reasons that come to mind that are most important for my readers. As with most hacks, this one is dangerous and I do have a strong feeling that Microsoft will eventually find a way to make anyone using it sorry they did. The support period for Windows XP has ended unless you have the money to pay for corporate level support—it’s time to move on.
I most definitely won’t provide support to readers who use the hack. There isn’t any way I can create a test system that will cover all of the contingencies so that I could even think about providing you with any support. If you come to me with a book-related issue and have the hack installed, I won’t be able to provide you with any support. This may seem like a hard nosed attitude to take, but there simply isn’t any way I can support you.
Questions continue to come in from readers who are still using Windows XP despite the fact that Microsoft is only marginally supporting it. Yes, it’s the operating system that refuses to die and readers really are confused as to why Microsoft has decided to kill what is obviously a popular operating system. They’re in good company. In fact, some authors, such as John Dvorak, have gone a lot further in their negative comments regarding the demise of Windows XP. The point is that Microsoft is quite determined to force anyone they can into using Windows 8.1, whether it works for them or not. It doesn’t seem to matter that people still have perfectly usable systems that are happily running Windows XP without problem.
My first two posts on this topic, Death of Windows XP? and Death of Windows XP? (Part 2) should have addressed any questions that people reading my books might have. Essentially, I recommend updating to Windows 7 (for business users) or Windows 8.1 (for consumers) when your hardware begins to die of old age or your needs change.
I no longer have access to a Windows XP system, so I’m not able to provide support for my old Windows XP books at this point in time. If you have one of my old Windows XP books, you’ll need to use it as is. I haven’t purposely gone out of my way to orphan the books, but the technology is old and I simply don’t have the resources to provide support for these books any longer. In addition, none of my current programming books are designed for Windows XP developers.
In the meantime, you need to ensure that you get security updates. Microsoft has extended a limited level of security support until 14 July 2015 that includes malware signatures and the associated engine. You won’t receive any sort of bug fixes. In order to enhance the security of your environment, you may want to consider these changes to your system:
Use a browser that receives regular security upgrades, such as Chrome or Firefox (IE is a bad choice because Microsoft won’t update it).
Examine your system (especially your hard drive) for signs of intruders (such as unexplained processes) on a regular basis.
These strategies can help you out for a while, but they’re short term solutions. Eventually, you need to go offline permanently (such as when using the system to run older games) or upgrade to something newer. Please let me know whether you have any additional questions about Windows XP and how it affects support for my books at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
It has been a while since I wrote the Simulating Users with the RunAs Command post that describes how to use the RunAs command to perform tasks that the user’s account can’t normally perform. (The basics of using the RunAs command appear in both Administering Windows Server 2008 Server Core and Windows Command-Line Administration Instant Reference.) A number of you have written to tell me that there is a problem with using the RunAs command with built-in commands—those that appear as part of CMD.EXE. For example, when you try the following command:
you are asked for the Administrator password as normal. After you supply the password, you get two error messages:
In fact, you find that built-in commands as a whole won’t work as anticipated. One way to overcome this problem is to place the commands in a batch file and then run the batch file as an administrator. This solution works fine when you plan to execute the command regularly. However, it’s not optimal when you plan to execute the command just once or twice. In this case, you must execute a copy of the command processor and use it to execute the command as shown here:
This command looks pretty convoluted, but it’s straightforward if you take it apart a little at a time. At the heart of everything is the md \Temp part of the command. In order to make this a separate command, you must enclose it in double quotes. Remember to escape the double quote that appears withing the command string by using a backslash (as in \”).
To execute the command processor, you simply type cmd. However, you want the command processor to start, execute the command, and then terminate, so you also add the /c command line switch. The command processor string is also enclosed within double quotes to make it appear as a single command to RunAs.
Make sure you use forward slashes and backslashes as needed. Using the wrong slash will make the command fail.
The RunAs command can now proceed as you normally use it. In this case, the command only includes the username. You can also include the password, when necessary. Let me know if you find this workaround helpful at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
The fact that Windows XP, despite some pretty aggressive attack by Microsoft on its own product, is still alive isn’t in doubt. Of course, there is the matter of support to consider. Microsoft has decided not to provide any more support for Windows XP unless you’re a big company or government organization with immensely deep pockets and have a lot of cash to spend. Stories abound about the Dutch and British governments forking over huge bucks to keep their copies of Windows XP patched. Of course, the IRS is in on it too. (Microsoft begrudgingly decided to provide security updates for Windows XP until 14 July 2015 after a lot of complaining.)
My previous post on this topic, Death of Windows XP?, discussed some of the pros and cons of keeping the aging operating system around. In general, it’s a good idea to update to Windows 7 if you have equipment that can run it. Windows 8 has received a lot of negative press, especially for business needs. After working with it for a while myself, I see it as a good consumer operating system, but not necessarily something a business would want to use. Even with the updates, Windows 8 simply forces the user to work too hard to get things done in a manner that businesses would normally do them.
What surprised me this past week (and it shouldn’t have) is that some larger organizations are taking matters into their own hands. For example, if you’re a Windows XP user in China, you can get updates for your Windows XP installation from Qihoo 360. The point is that it appears that Windows XP will continue to receive patches and security updates even if Microsoft isn’t involved. This process almost reminds me of what happened to IBM when it started to drop the ball on the PC. At one time, everything revolved around IBM, but then the company made some really bad decisions and third parties had an opportunity to take control of the market (which they promptly did).
Whether you believe Windows XP is worth saving or not isn’t the issue. What the whole Windows XP scenario points out is that Microsoft is losing it’s grip on the market, even the desktop market where it once reigned supreme. What are your thoughts about Microsoft’s future? Let me know at John@JohnMuellerBooks.com.
An interesting article made its way into my feed reader this morning. Michael Ruhlman was discussing responses to a recent article in the New York Times about recipe "dealbreakers".
The article focused on the things that we see in recipes that make us want to skip them and move onto the next step. The underlying theme of the article seemed to be, "what will a recipe say to you that will make you think it's too hard to try?" As I thought about it, I realized that I had some personal recipe dealbreakers too. As you might have guessed, I read a lot of recipes, mostly found in a variety of Google searches. What kinds of characteristics make me move on?
If a recipe calls for any brand name product, I am unlikely to consider it. If a recipe is poorly written, I will generally move on. If a recipe calls for "margarine or butter", I know that if I actually decide to make the recipe, it will indeed use butter. If a recipe oversimplifies steps that should not be oversimplified, I am unlikely to take it seriously. If a recipe reeks of inexperience (as most online recipes do), I will scoff at it and move on.
There are some recipes that I may spend hours analyzing, even though I know I will probaby never make it, at least the way that was intended. This often is because I respect the chef, or am interested in the technique, and want to understand it further. When a recipe calls for a difficult or expensive piece of equipment, I start wondering how unhappy my wife would be at me if I were to actually purchase or, in some cases, build it. In short, I don't like easy recipes. I like good recipes.
The author of the article refers to Chef Thomas Keller as the "modern king of fussy recipes", whereas Rhulman refers to him as the "master technician". In this case I will refer to Rhulman as "a man who knows what he's talking about" and the NYT writer as "a wimp, unsuited for spending any amount of time in the kitchen". In fact, as I read the anecdotes in this article, one word kept popping into my head to describe each of the cooks mentioned: "wuss".
Is this because I'm sort of elitist, perched atop my pedastal, waiting for the right moment to slander any cook who would dare show less experience than me? Okay, so maybe I'm a little bit elitist. My wife occassionally uses the word "snobbish". In my opinion, I'm a man who likes things done The Right Way. Actually, there are a lot of right ways to do a lot of things. As a Perl programmer, I often repeat the acronym "TMTOWTDI" (pronounced Tim Toady, meaning "There's More Than One Way To Do It"). Indeed, there often is. And what the right way is depends entirely on the situation.
In my class this week, and in fact in most of my classes, we discuss a serious danger that our users often put us in. Linux and Unix guys will know what I mean when I talk about users using "chmod 777" to share a file with others. For the rest of you, this means the file is accessable to the world in every way that a file can be. Anyone that can find it is able to add potentially malicious code to it and then run it, causing untold amounts of hard to the user, system, network, or worse. Why do users do this to us? Because it's the easy way to share files. Even if they know The Right Way, they still want to do things The Easy Way because that's the way they know how to do it. They can't be bothered with understanding why it's so dangerous. Some may even see it as "a bad habit that they'll fix when they have time".
We spent a decent amount of time talking about various right ways to share files, and I even polled my students on their favorites. We discussed various pros and cons of each one, and I ultimately advised my students to consider in each situation which was really the right method to use. After a full lecture that focused on three file sharing methods (FTP, NFS and SMB), I asked my students what they would prefer to use. I then told them that in most situations, I would rather use scp or SFTP, methods which were not covered in the lecture, but which they all were familiar with, and I could see a light turn on in their heads. They agreed that in most situations, that's what they would use too.
In the cooking world, there are various ways to do things that we don't even think about. The NYT article discussed one person who "won't truss" and "won't lard". How many people reading this post even know what trussing or larding means? Let's see, there are a couple of hands up in the corner... yes, Jayce^, I see you. You can sit down. The rest of you? If you want to learn a couple of techniques that will improve your cooking knowledge tremendously, look into trussing and larding. If they are too hard, move on and find something else. But don't knock the rest of us that know how to do it, and know why to do it.
I play with a lot of weird techniques. I'm sure plenty of people see me as weird and eccentric. Well, they do anyway, but I'm specifically referring to these techniques. I'm encouraged by the work of other chefs, real chefs, the pioneers that spend their free time experimenting with ingredients and techniques that are not common. Ferran Adria, Grant Achatz, Thomas Keller, Wylie Dufresne, Paul Bocuse, the list goes on. These are the avant garde who have brought and who will bring new techniques to help us reanalyze and redefine our cooking methodologies. I'm not saying I will ever be on a list with them. They have something that is in short supply on my resume: restaurant experience. But that won't stop me from trying.
The common thread between each of these pioneers is that they know and have mastered the basics. Without a solid foundation, they know that their work in the kitchen is nothing. Even the recent Pixar film Ratattouie tells us, "anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great". To the NYT writer, you can pretend all you want, but I think you know that until you do what it takes, you will only be a shell of what you seem to pretend to be. For you, I recommend the apple pie at McDonalds. That is the level that you apparently aspire to.

Upon further consideration, however, Rav Ahai Gaon appears to be perfectly correct, since there is actually more to the Sugya than we have heretofore seen:
The Poskim accept the view of רב חסדא ורבה בר רב הונא against that of רבה, so Rav Ahai Gaon’s requirement of day and night care seems eminently logical, and Rav Berlin’s objection quite baffling. This point is made by Neziv in his העמק שאלה :

At week 37, your pregnancy is considered full term, meaning baby is likely to thrive after birth. Baby spends these last weeks in preparation for the outside world… meaning careful refinement of the blink, suck, inhale and exhale. Meconium, which you’ll probably find in the first diaper, is accumulating in the intestines. If (okay, as) you worry about giving birth, consider what it’s like for the little one. During the journey out of your womb, baby will produce more stress hormones than any other time in life.

Trump has pulled ahead of Clinton nationally in both the new FOX poll and the Rasmussen Poll. And Trump passed Clinton in favorability according to the newest national poll on that topic. The Megyn Kelly interview (including the hyping of it ahead of time) marked Trump’s third-act turn.
By the way, Anderson Cooper of CNN said last night that CNN finds the FOX polling to be reliable and transparent, in case you wondered.
Meanwhile, Clinton is losing one primary after another to a dehydrated dandelion in her own party. That doesn’t bode well for the coming cage fight with Godzilla.
And Godzilla hasn’t even started to punch hard. He’s still looking at the opposition research and humming. So that’s coming.
Clinton is planning to appear on Ellen with the all-female cast of the new Ghostbusters movie. That’s what overplaying the woman card looks like. One wag on Twitter put it this way:
The New York Times did its best to make Trump look like a sexist, but they only succeeded in destroyed their own credibility when their star witness outed them for making up stuff.
Clinton surrogate Ed Rendel said something that was probably harmless in person, and in the proper context, but taken out of context by outragists it sounded like he was saying Clinton supporters are mostly ugly women. That didn’t help.
Clinton’s team continues to churn out anti-Trump hit pieces that ask you to imagine President Trump in office. By November, voters will think Trump has been running the country for a year and it looked a lot like the Obama administration. That’s called “graduated exposure” and it’s a well-understood psychological phenomenon. The Democrats are working overtime to make Trump feel less scary while believing they are doing the opposite.
Now imagine Clinton and Trump selecting VPs. If Clinton picks a woman, she overplays the woman card to destruction. If she selects a beta male, it will seem cringeworthy to the sexist public. If she selects an alpha male it will annoy her base without gaining a single vote. Clinton loses on every path.
Meanwhile, Trump can pick a man or a woman and it will look natural. No VP will overshadow Trump’s energy. All he needs is a running mate that is competent and a little bit interesting.
Trump announced his list of potential Supreme Court Justices. Republicans seemed to like the list, which makes Trump seem more mainstream even if you don’t like the names on the list.
A jet on the way from France to Egypt has disappeared, and terrorism is the assumed reason. That plays to Trump’s strength, as does every act of terror everywhere.
Trump has gone a few weeks without creating any new provocations on the scale of his 2015 self. The longer he proves he can moderate his behavior to fit the situation – as he did in the Megyn Kelly interview – the more people trust that he isn’t crazy.
Trump’s insults are now understood to be more than random hate. They are weapons-grade persuasion that have been engineered and then A-B tested at rallies. The “Crooked Hillary” harpoon is already doing its damage. If history is our guide, the nickname will bleed her out before November.
Paul Manafort, Trump’s campaign manager, knows how to win. The Clinton campaign doesn’t show the same level of talent, at least in terms of persuasion. Clinton’s logo (the big H) looks like a hospital sign. And their “Love Trumps Hate” slogan is two-thirds “Love Trump.” Any trained persuader knows people put more cognitive weight on the first part of sentences.
I’m teeming with confirmation bias, but from my kitchen counter, I don’t see how it can go any direction but a Trump landslide from here.
I’ll remind readers that I have disavowed all of the candidates. My political views don’t line up with any of them. My interest is in Trump’s persuasion skills.
If you think this blog has too many words with vowels, you should see my book. That thing is full of them.
When a president leaves office, you offer the ex-president an enormous speaking fee. Let’s say $400,000. The ex-president does the speech and banks the money. The ex-president has no power at that point, so the speaking fee can’t be seen as a bribe because there is no quid pro quo.
But what about the president that is in office while this happens? Do you think the current president notices when the the prior president gets a $400,000 payday for an hour of work?
So let’s say the company that hired the ex-president asks for a meeting with the current president. Do you think the company gets that meeting? And do you think the current president bends over backwards to get them whatever they need?
I agree with those who say President Trump hasn’t done enough draining of the swamp. But I do like having a president who could turn down a $400,000 payday without blinking. And that’s not nothing.
By the way, do you remember when Trump famously claimed he was worth $10 billion and his critics said it was closer to $3 billion? If Trump has a successful presidency (which I predict will happen), the Trump brand will be worth at least $10 billion at the end of his term. That would be no surprise to anyone who read the book that Trump’s childhood minister wrote.
Lots of patients are very scared of doing IVF. This is partly because they've heard lots of horror stories about how IVF babies are abnormal, or that the hormones will make them fat, or that if they grow too many eggs, they will either get menopausal sooner, or start getting ovarian cancer as they grow older. And, they've heard lots of horror stories from some of their friends, who've done IVF, about how painful the injections can be, or how many mood swings it causes, or the fact that you need bed rest or that there are lots of complications, or that the risk of miscarriage is higher after IVF.
There are lots of myths and misconceptions, and these obviously add to the patient's anxiety, because of the fear of the unknown, that you end up spending so much time, money and energy, and even after doing all that, not only may you not end up getting a baby, you may actually be worse off because of all the side effects you've put yourself through.
Somehow a lot of IVF seems very artificial and unnatural today, because patients think that you're doing stuff in the laboratory, you're manipulating things, you're doing stuff, which nature wasn't designed to do, as a result of which there are likely to be problems. They often don't trust doctors, and we tell them there won't be problems because most doctors will always try to reassure patients and their concern is that we're not aware of some of these long term side effects, or that we're trying to sell our treatment just because it's more profitable for us.
I think the only way of getting over all this anxiety and fear of unknown, is what I call information therapy. Patients need to read up about IVF from reliable websites so they understand what the truth is, and they can separate the myths, which are so prevalent and they don't get carried away by old wives tales, because otherwise they will end up depriving themselves of the best chance of getting pregnant, and regret this once they get older, and time doesn't come back.

Ariel DAVID: "In anti-BDS Move, Italy Bringing Huge Academic Delegation to Israel " (Haaretz, May 30, 2016): click here!
Dozens of researchers and academics from the two countries will meet in 'unprecedented' response to campaign to boycott Israeli universities.
In another blow to the Israeli campaign to criminalize Palestine solidarity activism, the Irish government has affirmed that the global boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement represents a “legitimate” means of protest “intended to pressure Israel into ending the occupation.”
Michael DEAS: "BDS is free speech, says Dutch government" (The Internet Intifada, 25 May, 2016): click here!
In response to parliamentary questions from Green Left MP Rik Grashoff, Dutch foreign minister Bert Koenders said that “statements or meetings concerning BDS are protected by freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, as enshrined in the Dutch constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.”
In 1989, the queer theory professor Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, a founder of the field, presented a paper, “Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl,” at the annual gathering of the Modern Language Association (MLA).

The Foreign Ministry has no overall strategy, lacks funds and is failing to achieve its goals in the battle against the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions campaign against Israel, a damning state comptroller’s report charged on Tuesday.

"We chose to partner with McAfee ASaP because anti-virus is a vital piece to a total network security package," says SecureWorks president and CEO Robert Minkhorst. "This partnership with McAfee ASaP allows us to offer best of breed anti-virus in an Internet-based model that works in tandem with our managed intrusion prevention services."

If Stranger Records likes your music, the label invites you in London and pays the tickets of the travel, even if you live in an other country.
Stranger Records is so in love with your music that he tells you he will send the tracks of your songs to some producers (possibly John Cale too) to be reworked in optimum conditions.

The word gelato, in Italian, simply means “ice cream,” but its meaning has shifted to define a type of high-end frozen dessert, made with milk, not cream. Gelato also has 35% less air whipped into it than ice cream, heightening its rich mouthfeel without tipping the scales. Gelato, in all its luxury, is simple to make at home with a standard ice-cream maker.

Have you ever gone on a God Hunt? A God Hunt begins when you teach yourself to look for God’s hand at work in the every day occurrences of your life. Here’s one of my personal God Hunt Sightings:
“Did you see the oil lamps beside the path?” I asked my husband after the Wednesday evening group had departed. David often just stays at the office and works late when I have listening groups at the house from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m.
H-m-m-m, I thought. Maybe I need to hang another couple of lamps by the corner of the driveway where people park their cars. Maybe another two by the old iron pot in the garden at the other side of our circle drive.
Hawthorne Lane, where we live, is dark at night. There are few street lamps. Consequently, the porch light fades into the darkening gardens when people come to visit, for dinner, or for meetings after the sun has set.
Instead of solar lights (one day maybe) or the expense and effort of installing a pole lamp (they say the ditch needs to be at least 4 feet deep to lay the electrical connections), I’ve opted for collecting old hanging kerosene oil lamps—the rustier the better. Admittedly, this is impractical in our modern age, but I love the smell of oil burning. Two of these lamps have hung outside all summer and fall, on low shepherd hooks designed for hanging plants. By now, they are properly corroded with lovely, flaking rust.
I designed the fall arrangement in our narrow hallway around the old glass oil lantern, and as I was pouring lamp oil through a funnel into the narrow hole, I thought about the lamps that had hung outside all summer with no need to light them since the days were so long.
So inside they came. Could I even get them open? Could I unscrew the little caps to the base of the lamps so I could pour in the oil? Or had they become so rusted that it would be impossible to even use they way I intended to use them?
With a little pressure, the levers pressed down lifting the glass lantern up from the base and away from the wick. Sure enough, there were wicks in each lamp (how in the world would I replace them when these were burnt away?—a problem to figure out when the time came). A rubberized cloth turned the caps. I poured oil and filled the lamps. A lighter reached to the wicks, they flamed, I lowered the glass, adjusted the fire and carried the lamps to the hooks beside my front walk path.
What a lovely greeting for friends and family! I thought. How warm and welcoming as people approach our front door in the night.
But—David hadn’t even seen them. What a letdown. How many lamps would I have to collect and fill and find before people who came to our front door would see them and be warmed by their soft, non-electric-light glare?
I’ve just finished reading through the Old Testament, a long spring and summer spent in the minor and major prophets. What a relief to reach the New Testament where it looks as though I will approach the Christmas season spending time in the Gospels with the life of Christ.
In his great kindness, God has lightened the world to that Great Light (for which we all long, knowing it or not) with little oil lamps shining here and there along the way. For some, to gaze at that One who has dawned, is forever dawning and who will eternally and radiantly dawn would be like staring at a nuclear blast. The lamps are lit, leading the way through the gathering dusk, with the days shortening and winter gloom coming.
But, in order to see, we must stop and notice, pay attention, look and consider and let ourselves feel the small rays of warmth.

Fortunately, we need not speculate about Rav Berlin’s intention, since Mossad Harav Kook’s edition of the העמק שאלה contains as an appendix Rav Berlin’s manuscript notes to his own copy of the שאילתות (which really form the basis for a second edition of his commentaries to that work) in which he explains his rather elliptical comment at much greater length.

Stray are a British band formed in 1966. Vocalist Steve Gadd (born 27 April 1952, Shepherd's Bush, London), guitarist Del Bromham (born Derek Roy Bromham, 25 May 1951, in Acton, London) (ex Tradera), bass player Gary Giles (born Gary Stephen Giles, 23 February 1952, in London) and drummer Steve Crutchley (born c 1952) formed the band whilst all were attending the Christopher Wren School in London. Richard "Ritchie" Cole (born 10 November 1951, in London) replaced Crutchley in 1968. They signed to Transatlantic Records in January 1970.
The group's brand of melodic, hook-laden hard rock proved to be a popular draw on the local club scene during the early 1970s. However the band did not have commercial success with its record releases. At one stage Charlie Kray (brother of the Kray twins Ronnie and Reggie), was their manager. Gadd left the band in 1975 due to artistic differences and was replaced on vocals by Pete Dyer.
The original Stray finally dissolved in 1977, although Bromham later continued to play in various resurrected versions of the project well into the 2000s.
There are two Iron Maiden connections to Stray. The early song "All in Your Mind" from the Stray 1970 debut album was covered by Maiden, and Maiden bassist Steve Harris's daughter Lauren has covered "Come On Over".
From late 2006 until early 2007, the band's back catalog of eight studio albums issued originally during the 1970s were re-released by the UK-based Sanctuary Records in compact disc format. The new releases are remastered and add bonus tracks culled from single B-sides, studio outtakes and BBC broadcast sessions.
The Universal Music Group have just bought the entire back catalogue and Stray are touring again with Del Bromham (guitar and vocals), Stuart Uren (bass guitar and vocals) and Karl Randall on drums.
One of the great records of the early 70's by one of the great bands who should have been massive. Saturday Morning Pictures starts with Our Song acoustic intro followed by crashing power chords enter Steve Gadd's super vocals and anthemic chorus and you have a classic rock song.
Track two is yet another classic the Hendrix inspired After The Storm both of these opening two tracks are so good that they are still in the band's set list at the time of writing some 37 years later. Track three is the harmony driven space rock of Sister Mary followed by the brilliant Move That Wigwam.
Next up and live favourite is Leave It Out great riff, country violins, slide guitar that could peel paint,Steve Gadd again excelling on vocals (as he does on the whole album) WHAT A SONG this ends and we are straight into the dirty opening riffs of How Could I Forget You which gives way to some blues country-folk with some terrific vocal interplay between Gadd and guitarist Del Bromham (Del Bromham - what a guitarist, his playing has soul - what a songwriter - what a showman live).
Last track on the original album is the melodic Queen Of The Sea again great guitar work by Bromham. This re-issue has bonus tracks including single B-side to opening track Our Song called Mama's Coming Home another great track it is fast and very catchy with a great little piano fade out (My 18 year old son can't understand how it did not make the album). Georgia is classic dirty down blues with fantastic slide guitar and Gadd's brilliant vocals. Get Out Right Away is a catchy slice of roots rock and we also have a BBC session version of Sister Mary and the 45 r.p.m. version of Our Song.So in conclusion this is a masterpiece, not a bad track on it (personally i find Zeppelin,Sabbath,Purple etc boring and dated) go and seek this band out or go and see them live if you like rock music you will probably love this - Stray rock but with soul and intelligence.
Somehow I missed out on these guys back in the day. Some pretty loose and wooly jams. I love their 'go-for-it' attitude, mixing up every influence that they ever heard. Sounds to me like Jeff Tweedy copped a a bit of Stray for Wilco.
Anticipating that this Japanese version may be a sonic upgrade over what I have. Fine album for sure, here I find the band a little less adventurous and interesting than on previous efforts. Many thanks, Nelwizard! :D :D :D

Florida has a tremendous opportunity to boost its economy and help thousands of unemployed workers stay afloat as they look for their next job.
More than 1 million of our residents are now unemployed. Our neighbors, our friends, and their families are struggling everyday to cover necessities like housing, health care, and food. Unemployment compensation (UC) is a necessary tool to help them and our state get back on its feet.
As a result of the Federal American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA), Florida could receive $444 million in federal funding to pay for unemployment benefits. For Florida to get this sorely needed money, the legislature needs to modernize our UC system and mend holes in our UC safety net.

For most of the second half of the twentieth century, Walter Cronkite was always there whenever history moved. Before the word "embedded" came into fashion, he flew on the first bombing raids over Germany in a B-17 Flying Fortress. Before he covered the Kennedy Assassination, Vietnam and Watergate, he was also right there at the Battle of the Bulge. He covered the first nationally televised Democratic and Republican National Conventions - out of which the term "anchor" (and the Swedish term "Kronkiter") was coined to describe his role. Walter Cronkite was always there; he was the anchor of all anchors.
But while Cronkite was always there, he understood that it was never about him, but about the facts. Today however, his model of reporting is praised by everyone, but emulated by no one.
Not by Lou Dobbs, or Keith Olbermann, and not even by his replacement at CBS, Dan Rather, who tried to meddle in politics rather than to report it. CNN has a name for this narcissistic reporting style: "I-report." I don't think Walter Cronkite believed that there was an "I" in the news, however much an event lent itself to self-reflection.
So Cronkite's legacy lives on only in advertising slogans. CNN may be "the most trusted name in news," and Fox news may be "Fair and Balanced." But "the most trusted man in America" would tell us that self-praise is no praise and that objectivity should be practiced, not trumpeted.
To be sure, it isn't that today's journalists are unrepentant gossips or opinion exhibitionists (though some are). It is that their bosses know that opinion and fiesty debate sells. It is because experts in mass communications and social psychology have discovered that listeners and viewers like to hear what they want to hear, especially opinions that cohere with their own. That is why our journalistic umpires venture their opinions, and if they don't, they pose incendiary questions to get their interviewers to say something about their political opponents that would start a war of words. While Walter Cronkite covered the news, the news establishment today wants to drive it.
Cronkite was a first-rate journalist who understood that it is always about the news, never about the reporter, transmitting the news faithfully while at the scene but never making a scene. He didn't engage in story making, he didn't engage in frivolous banter about the role of the media in order to insinuate the self-congratulatory premise that he is a mover and shaker and master of the universe. Walter Cronkite knew that it was never about Walter Cronkite. It was his principled commitment to reticence that made his exceptional departure in declaring the war in Vietnam unwinnable so compelling. In his self-abnegation lay his considerable credibility.
Walter Cronkite was confident enough in the processes of American democracy, and humble enough to know the difference between newscaster and newsmaker, to desist from meddling from either the meaning or movement of politics. Without touch-screen monitors or a teleprompter, he brought us the news. Plain and simple. He wasn't cool, he wasn't a model, and he was even, by his own admission, "dull at times."

Applying for grant funding for churches and historic building conservation - Harrison Pitt Architects
Applying for grant funding for the conservation and restoration of churches and listed buildings can be a complex and daunting task.
The rules on which projects qualify are stringent and decisions on whether to award funding often hinge on technicalities and other small details.
As many of those seeking grant funding for churches and other places of worship are volunteers, with little or no expertise in such matters, it’s hardly surprising that many applications for grant funding fail.
For example, when the chancellor George Osbourne announced a £15 million fund for urgent repairs to roofs on listed places of worship late last year, the eight week application proved a tough call for church wardens and parochial church council members given that it fell over Christmas.
At Harrison Pitt Architects we have been involved in large number of successful applications for grant funding to help with church conservation and the restoration of other listed and historic buildings. There are some basic principles of a successful application for grant funding and here are my top tips:
This should go without saying, but you need to check that you meet the funder’s criteria. For example, some funders, such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, only support listed churches. The Church Urban Fund targets mainly anti-poverty initiatives within the community. Applying to the wrong fund that won’t support you can be a costly waste of time and resources.
It doesn’t matter if you’ve done it many times before, each application is new and different. The requirements are always changing and different grant bodies require different documentation to support your application. Make sure you’re clear on exactly what is required and how the application is to be submitted.
In some cases the supporting documentation you need, if it’s being provided by a specialist body, consultant or authority, can take weeks to receive. By understanding any deadlines for the funding you’re applying for, you can then ‘work backwards’ from that point to ensure you have enough time to get all the documentation, evidence, and professional advice you need. A rushed application is often a poor one, so create a timetable. Always make yourself a copy of the application for your own records (and for reference in future applications) and to provide to consultants and contractors who’ll be working with you on the project.
Why does your building have a unique need to be restored? High quality photographs, architects and other consultants’ reports, cost proposals and so on, will answer this question for the grant assessors and show that you’ve been thorough and diligent in your approach. You should also demonstrate that you’ve consulted a wide range of stakeholders on the project and that you’ve made exhaustive efforts to raise funds and remedy issues by other means.
If you don’t ask you don’t get. Lots of funders like to give many small grants, so in larger projects be prepared to apply to many sources. However, avoid just cutting and pasting information and answers from previous applications. Grant assessors review hundreds of applications and will quickly spot applications that have failed to provide the right information to the right questions. Each application should be unique.
If at first you don’t succeed, don’t be too disheartened. Get feedback for why you didn’t receive the grant and think about how you can improve your application next time. Sometimes it’s due to matters outside of your control and a case of the right application submitted at the wrong time. Many applications can be successful second time round. Funding bodies, such as those linked to the national lottery, have several funding rounds and application dates each year, so be prepared to keep giving it another go.

The idol devout will always believe every official statement from the management or scripted comment from a girl, no matter what. They can be heard crying out “Kanna really did leave C-ute because of excessive bunions! She would never abandon her group like that!!” Presumably she recovered in time for her return to the industry as a racy grauve model though, right? Also, these people honestly believe that no member’s graduation has EVER been anything but 100% her own decision, made with her personal happiness in mind. So even when Tsunku comments after Koharu’s graduation announcement, “As for Kusumi, she was puzzled at first, but she accepted it firmly”. These people still insist that Koharu chose to leave on her own to become a model. She even later said that she had “Discussed with Tsunku and various people!” She left to pursue her dreams! Let’s imagine how that “discussion” went, shall we?
Viola. They discussed. Koharu accepted. The idol devout will fly in the face of all logic in order to preserve their happy fluffy ideal of idol life, and nothing will deter them.
These people will NEVER EVER believe anything the management says. Every graduation or resignation is actually the result of a secret sex scandal, a nasty dispute over salary, or group infighting. All the members of every group secretly despise each other and are completely miserable. They just have to put on a happy face because Tsunku beats them if they don’t. The idol world is more cut-throat and ruthless than the Hunger Games.
My problem with both of these groups is that they have a knee jerk reaction to every event that fails to take logic or considering the facts into account. I guess I’m more of an idol agnostic. I believe that I can’t ever really know what goes on behind closed doors in the idol world, but I try to look at the information I have and make my best guess. Where would you place yourself on the idol faith continuum?
You know who else I don’t like? Terrible singers or groups of singers who post videos of their voices dubbed over idol performances on youtube. If you’re decent, then okay, but if you are an awful singer, nobody wants to hear that.
I’m not one for pic. spam, but GUH! (was the sound of my eyes popping out like a cartoon) Is anyone prettier than Sayumi? Like, ever in the history of the world?? There’s a lot of pretty girls out there, but Sayu… she’s something special. She’s also, apparently, a killer bunny dominatrix. Probably should have suspected that all along.
Seriously. She’s BY FAR their most popular member, and the “new members” aren’t even close to being able to replace her. Combined, they might equal a Saki, but they’ll never equal a Yuuka. She was almost a perfect idol. Sad for Dawa and Kanon. The group had so much promise, and now it’s all falling apart.
My guess, and I’m sure others will agree, she wasn’t as happy with all the recent changes in S/mileage as they all have to pretend to be.
I thought about this before, but as more and more time goes by, the more I’m starting to suspect the answer might be no. Let’s look at the evidence for and against an Aika comeback.
-She showed up and sang in the encore at Ai-chan’s graduation concert, so she’s definitely not out of h!p yet
-She’s in the new Mobekimasu PV (very briefly), and she was in the last single’s PVs too (however, all of these were filmed a while ago) But at least it seems like they’re making an effort to show that she still exists, unlike when Kana went on “hiatus” from C-ute and she didn’t appear in their next single, sitting or no
-She stopped updating her blog at the end of June. Pretty sure you can update a blog from a sitting position
-Historical precedent. Arihara Kana from h!p, Matsushita Yui from SKE, and Saeki Mika from AKB are all examples of idols who suffered medical issues or injuries, disappeared for a long time but showed up once in a while in special appearances (not Kana), and then eventually announced their graduations because their treatment was taking a lot longer than expected. That brings us to…
-Aika was supposed to be back and fully recovered by September 23rd, after 8 weeks of rest. Cut to September 30th, a week later, and Aika appears at Ai-chan’s graduation in a wheel chair. Clearly, she is nowhere near healed enough to dance if she can’t even walk yet. I believe that originally, they fully intended to bring Aika back (the early evidence points to this. Inclusion in PVs and the concert intro and goods, etc.), but her recovery doesn’t seem to be going well, and who knows how much longer it will take or even if she will ever be able to dance again without risk of re-injuring herself.
-And let’s not forget, she’s not exactly an “essential” member popularity or vocals-wise. Remember when Ai-chan hurt her ankle and she still sang at Yossie’s graduation concert (sitting down)? They tried that with Aika at first (the fan club tour) but then they stopped (MM’s recent tour).
“Introducing New 11 Member Morning Musume!” , says the headline. 11. “New” Morning Musume has 11 members, not 12. Would it have been so hard to get Aika on this cover? I know she already has one of those costumes (unless they gave it to one of the 10th gen girls). She wouldn’t have to dance. It might not mean anything, but it sort of looks like they’ve stopped trying to include her in things, even when she can participate.
I’m not totally convinced either way, but at this point, I can safely say that come the h!p Winter Concerts neither a full comeback nor a tearful announcement followed by a nice little graduation ceremony at the last show would surprise me.
PS. Looking at that picture, it really hits me how very different current MM looks from the group who’s concerts I attended back when I was in Japan
Like the post title says, I know everyone is already done with this topic, but I felt like it’s significant enough that I need to comment.
So the results come in, and all four S/mileage sub-members have been promoted. Everybody pretty much saw this coming, but questions remain. Did management ever seriously consider kicking any of them out, or was it all a publicity stunt? And most importantly, was it the right choice?
I tried to keep an open mind at first. I was even optimistic. And after careful consideration/ watching the S/mileage live-streaming concert…
Somehow, it feels like a desperate attempt to stuff as many warm bodies in to the group as possible in hopes that someone would fill the hole left by Saki. The auditions were, as admitted by management (Tsunku I think) “rushed”. There was no application round, little time between the announcement and the actual audition, and only girls who were able to be in Tokyo on the appointed day and showed up were able to audition. The result? A much smaller field of girls to choose from. You can disagree if you’d like, but comparing the S/mileage audition finalists to the Morning Musume audition finalists, I believe that the overall “idol” quality was much lower in the S/mileage pool. Sure there was Karin, but she is apparently needed elsewhere (TBA). Miyazaki Yuuka was cute, but too old and too tall. Yamaga was a good singer, but just not pretty enough to be an idol (sorry, but she wasn’t). Oda Sakura was too shy, a terrible dancer, and again, not pretty enough. Jang had zero energy and couldn’t remember the song to save her life.
Keep in mind, S/mileage is quite a high quality idol group. They were chosen as the best of the Eggs at a time when there were tons of Eggs running around. All three remaining girls are very pretty, good dancers, and two of them are good singers as well. I’ve come to expect a certain quality from S/mileage, and I believe that at the very least, Nakanishi Kana and Katsuta Rina aren’t up to par.
First, Kana. Didn’t stand out at the audition, and even now I’m not sure why she was picked other than that she had a nice smile and seems like a hard worker. Her singing, and especially her dancing just aren’t nearly good enough. Period. She’s going to drag the group down. This isn’t Morning Musume which, to a certain extent, celebrates having different types of girls. It’s S/mileage. They all got the same hair cut for goodness sake. And did you ever notice how the S/mileage girls’ costumes are usually very very similar or exactly the same? (the other h!p groups almost always have variety from girl to girl). They’re supposed to kind of “match” when they’re performing. And Kana does not match.
Next, Rina. Is she talented enough? Sure. She’s probably the most consistent singer of the new members. There’s two problems. 1. Her looks. I don’t think she’s “ugly” as some have said. She’s even cute in some photos, but she’s no where near the three original S/mileage members. And looks are so very important in the idol world. 2. The much bigger problem, in my mind, her personality. Or lack there off. She seems kind of sweet… but that’s about it. S/mileage is known for their energetic, playful personalities. Rina bores me.
I still have hope that Meimi and Akari could become worthy S/mileage members, and really, I think they should have been the only two picked in the end. Both are good dancers, and both are pretty cute (though still probably not as cute as the original S/mileage members). Meimi definitely has a perfect S/mileage personality, and while her vocals are squeaky, that fits in with the group’s style, and she does have a strong voice. Akari also has pretty good vocals, and at least she has an idol persona to distinguish herself (Sporty Spice Girl).
So yeah, the girls would be heart broken, but if they were truly looking to create the strongest overall S/mileage, I think they should have cut Kana and Rina (or never let them in in the first place). It looks like their plan is to use Yuuka’s recent popularity surge (her mixi numbers are climbing like crazy!) to carry the group despite some weak members, and it’ll probably work, but it makes me sad to think of the S/mileage that could have been. All I know is that I like S/mileage a lot less with the new members than I did without them, and it’s not because I hate the idea of adding new girls. It’s because I care about S/mileage and they deserved better than getting stuck with the results of this hasty audition.
I really think the song is very nice. It was probably a good move giving it a very different feel from “All for 1 and 1 for All”. I especially like the “ready?” lines. The PV however… sigh. It’s just boring unfortunately. You think they could have put in some effort to make this one a little special.
But what really upsets me about this release is the fresh surge of “Riho-hate” it has caused. That combined with the whining and obnoxious crys of “IT’S NOT FAIR!!”. Well no shit, it’s not fair. When and how did you ever get it in your head that the idol world was fair? Or even that it should be fair?
The two primary arguments are this “Everyone should get an equal amount of focus” and “The most senior members, or group leaders, should get the most focus (and therefore, Riho should be in the back)”. So let’s look at this from a business standpoint.
1. “Everyone should get an equal amount of focus”. How many girls were in that PV? 28 or so? If everyone gets an equal amount of focus, NO ONE gets much focus. Which groups in h!p have the most equal line distribution? S/mileage (when they had 4 members) and C-ute (NOTICE: The line distribution only became closer to even after they lost a couple members). When you have a small group, you can afford to focus on each girl more without taking away from your most marketable members. Not possible if you’ve got 28 girls. The purpose of this Mobekimasu song, as I see it, is to draw some new attention and new fans to h!p. They’re getting to perform it on some shows that h!p rarely appears on lately, and it will likely be viewed by many people who are unfamiliar with h!p. It’s important that they highlight their most marketable members, because they’re the ones most likely to draw in new interest. The girls who are, to put it nicely, less conventionally attractive, charismatic, or talented (though they have their own good points blahblahblah) CANNOT be allowed to take valuable camera time away from the money makers. It’s not “everyone is equally special and valuable let’s all hug” time. It’s a business, and in the idol business, some girls are just more special and valuable than others. You’re kidding yourself if you honestly think otherwise.
2. “The most senior members (or group leaders) should get the most focus”. Wrong for a couple simple reasons. First, the most senior members may not be the most popular/most likely to draw in new fans (see above). Remember, if they decide to push a girl, it’s not a random decision. They have a reason, and they have plenty of experience picking out which girls could be the most popular. Secondly, the older a girl, the less time she likely has left in the idol world. What happens when Risa and Maimi and Saki S. graduate (it will happen eventually), we’re just left with the younger girls, and everyone says “Who?”. For the long-term health of the company, it’s important for h!p to promote their future stars as well (Yuuka, and especially Riho).
I’ve talked about this before, and I know I’ve ruffled some feathers, but I hope I explained it a little more clearly this time. I’m not saying I wouldn’t be happy if Gaki or Chisa had gotten a solo line, but I know why they didn’t, and I’m not going to rage about it.
PS: Not entirely on topic, but I want to get this off my chest. Many of us (myself included) have grown up in a generation that’s been taught that the world should be fair and “everyone is equally wonderful”. That you should feel proud of yourself and have high self-esteem for merely existing. I believe that mentality has created an entire generation of lazy, entitled, and arrogant kids and young adults. The fact is, in the real world you don’t always get what you deserve, and you don’t always deserve what you get. (though your odds improve with hard work and natural talent) Point being, people transfer that sense of entitlement over to their favorite idols as well. Japan doesn’t seem to have a problem separating people into winners and losers (no crappy, everybody gets a participation trophy!, we’re all winners!, “competitions” there), and so they have less problem with their idols being separated into winners and losers similarly. Just look at the annual AKB “elections” if you don’t believe me.
Hey guys. I made some new AKB themed “Name That Song” videos, and I needed somewhere to post the answers. Rest assured, I am still primarily a h!p fan, but my youtube channel dabbles in both fandoms.
So, apologies that this isn’t related to h!p. I promise that the next blog post will be back to our regularly scheduled programming.
1. When did Riho learn to sing like that?? It’s like she found a flaw (okay, but not outstanding vocals) and corrected it in a matter of months by sheer force of will. You’ve got to admit, this girl is very serious about reaching the top of the Morning Musume pyramid as soon as possible (and it looks like she’s only got Reina in her way at this point, though some of these 10th gens may be trouble)
Tomo- 256 “na”s 256!! That’s got to be a world record number of “na”s. It’s like “The Song That Doesn’t End” except every word is “na”

Apple has come up with the biggest change to the iOS to address the growing chorus of discontent against the operating system whose UI has remained static since iOS 5 was released. Apple’s new OS has a radical new look which is pretty similar to android. The visual overhaul is a clean sweep of absolutely everything from color schemes to the iconic apple button shaped icons. While there are a few notable new features in iOS7, it does nothing to threaten its competitors. However, there is a feeling that apple is saving some major reveals for its next iPhone announcement.
Gone are those bubbly icon effects and in come the flat and sharp graphics and pastel color scheme. Apple promises a 3D effect that makes your wallpaper appear distant from the icons when you move your phone. And the “slide to unlock” screen lock which was so synonymous with the iPhone goes out the window and in comes the “slide up to unlock” lock screen which is very Android-esque.
Another feature which is pretty synonymous with android users is the control center from where you can access pretty much everything your phone boasts of. The only difference is to access the control center you have to slide down in android whereas you gotta slide up in the iOS7.
In notification center three tabs show you all the alerts, the calls and messages you’ve missed and a new “today” pane tracks all your goings-on.
The biggest change to the browser is a unified search and URL field. And now you can preview the tabs vertically again very much android-esque. And guess what you are no longer limited to 8 tabs in the browser. And not to forget the new safari icon is not one that would be liked by everyone.
This feature would be liked by Mac users, a peer to peer file sharing that supports all of the Apple devices. It works by creating a local ad-hoc network among nearby users.
Apple has launched this service which is pretty much an expansion of iTunes as a direct competition for slacker radio, Pandora , Nokia music and pretty much any other music service. It’s free for all and ad-free for iTunes match users.
A feature which is bitter sweet for users,while we don’t like constantly looking at the update notifications, there are some apps which we would want to see the new features before we update. But Apple has assured that auto updates can be turned off in settings.
This is a feature that most of us would be uncomfortable with, basically it’s made to store all your sensitive data like credit card numbers and passwords which u can access using a password that u need to require, though it’s uncertain how secured is your sensitive information.
Since Steve Jobs had passed away Apple has lost a little bit of direction under Tim Cook. Though there is a major effort being made to significantly improve iOS Apple have ended up mimicking Android. The biggest disappointment to the iOS users is that iOS doesn’t seem to be unique anymore. But on the other hand though iPhone users would be happy that they no longer need to jailbreak their devices.
By now, most of us know that BlackBerry 10 devices are different animals from their earlier counterparts. I still love my BlackBerry Bold 9900 smartphone, and it still works great. In the spirit of my dueling BlackBerry devices, I thought I’d share five quick things I’ve noticed as being big hardware differences between my BlackBerry Bold 9900 and the new BlackBerry Z10.
Front-Facing Camera. I love having a front-facing camera for video conferencing, and I found myself wanting it on my BlackBerry Bold smartphone so I wouldn’t have to grab my BlackBerry PlayBook tablet. It’s a small thing, but to me it’s an important feature.
4G LTE. Availability of 4G speeds depend a great deal on your carrier, but the download speeds I’ve noticed on the BlackBerry Z10 definitely make videos and sharing faster and smoother.
Apps and Games. While I definitely had a great collection of apps and games on my BlackBerry Bold smartphone, the graphics and processing capabilities of the BlackBerry Z10 are just that much better. What I’ve found in BlackBerry World is an awesome collection of fun and high quality games and productive apps that help me get through my day.
Screen Resolution. Can we talk about 356 pixels per inch for second? It’s gorgeous. I remember being blown away by the 286 pixels per inch my BlackBerry Bold smartphone sported, but 356 is so much sweeter. And don’t get me started on the 1080p HD recording versus the BlackBerry Bold 9900’s 720p.
Of course, since BlackBerry 10 is an entirely new OS, there are also a ton of user experience differences, but these five hardware goodies offer their own slice of mobile deliciousness as well.

Justin Bieber’s Christian faith has been growing and on display in recent months, and now he just used it to reach out and minister God’s goodness to a British nation reeling from recent terror attacks.
Terrorists used a vehicle to mow down pedestrians on London Bridge Saturday night and then jumped out and stabbed more people to death. That came two weeks after a suicide bomber killed 22 victims, many of them young girls, attending an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.
At the “One Love Manchester” concert Sunday night, which had already been scheduled before the London attack, Grande returned to the stage to offer comfort to a grieving city.
Other music stars like Katy Perry and Justin Bieber also joined in the concert to encourage the hurting and raise money to help victims. But Bieber didn’t just offer some music and a message of resilence, he had a message of faith to offer as well.
“God is good in the midst of the darkness. God is good in the midst of the evil,” Bieber told the massive crowd.
“God is in the midst no matter what’s happening in the world, God is in the midst, and He loves you and He’s here for you,” he said.
“I just want to take this moment to honor the people that were lost, that were taken. We love you so much. To the families, we love you so much,” he said. “Put both hands up to honor those people right now. Everybody say, ‘We honor you. We love you.'”

If you are an ISNA donor, you will be hearing from us very soon. In a major Parliamentary report in Australia, published in October , the Senate Community Affairs References committee was "disturbed" by the possible implications of current practices in the treatment of cancer risk. With Accord Alliance in place, ISNA can close its doors with the comfort and knowledge that its work will continue to have an impact. Getting rid of misleading language: At present, the new standard of care exists as little more than ideals on paper, thus falling short of its aim to improve the lives of people with DSDs and their families. One of the challenges in explaining Intersex is that we often confuse it with transgender.
Unfortunately, many people who were Intersex were dealt a crushing blow by psychologists and surgeons who felt they knew better than nature. Today we know to leave well enough alone. Treating cancer may be regarded as unambiguously therapeutic treatment, while normalising surgery may not. If you are an ISNA donor, you will be hearing from us very soon. More cautious approach to surgery: Although being intersex is relatively common, there remains a startling lack of awareness among the general population. A German study conducted by a medical team between and covered the experiences of intersex individuals of all ages, from Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Certain intersex rights advocates argue that this may dispel the myth that intersex people are "hybrid degenerated" to be sex criminals, creating more understanding for intersex people. In , ISNA sponsored and convened a national group of health care and advocacy professionals to establish a nonprofit organization charged with making sure the new ideas about appropriate care are known and implemented across the country. The vast majority of people who are transgender are born with genitals that look perfectly normal. The committee is disturbed by the possible implications of this One of the challenges in explaining Intersex is that we often confuse it with transgender. An exception is an intersex condition called AIS, which I will discuss below. This website will remain up as a historical artifact. At present, the new standard of care exists as little more than ideals on paper, thus falling short of its aim to improve the lives of people with DSDs and their families. Human rights institutions question such approaches as being "informed by redundant social constructs around gender and biology". Many Australian study participants stated a need to educate their physicians. Accord Alliance believes that improving the way health care is made available and delivered is essential to ensure that people receive the services and support they need to lead healthy, happy lives. Their parents can raise them as boys or girls based on best guess, the way we were all raised. While there will be social hurdles, kids with ambiguous genitals will probably do better if their genitals are left for them to decide what to do with. Two-thirds made a connection between those problems and the medical and surgical treatment they had been subjected to. This is just one of many forms of intersexuality, and other intersex people have very different traits from Odiele. It also states that the functional outcome of genital surgeries should be emphasized, not just cosmetic appearance. We believe the most fruitful way to move beyond the current dynamic is to support a new organization with a mission to promote integrated, comprehensive approaches to care that enhance the overall health and well-being of persons with DSDs and their families. Participating children reported significant disturbances, especially within their family life and in relation with their physical well-being.

Despite having lived in Israel for 22 years with no criminal record of any kind, Omar Barghouti was this week denied the right to travel outside the country.

In the twenty first century, few things are more difficult than running a small business. Achieving success requires a massive amount of patience and expertise. It’s worth stating that the modern business environment is actually quite competitive. You have any number of rivals, and each one wants to take your share of the market.
If you want to succeed in this environment, it’s important to take a holistic approach. Advertising is crucial, and you also need to look at the hiring process. At the end of the day, though, your number one priority should be to assess payroll. There are actually many ways in which payroll will influence your company.
It can affect morale, but it will also influence how your employees do their jobs. At the same time, though, managing payroll can be quite difficult. It takes real ability to achieve success. If you’re not sure of how to improve this process, you will want to use an online pay stub generator. If you use a pay stub generator, it will be relatively easy for you to be successful.
As you are certainly aware, though, no two pay stub generators are ever one hundred percent the same. It’s up to you to find a pay stub generator that inspires confidence. Remember to consider your own expectations when you’re looking for a pay stub generator. Before you do anything else, you will want to look at price. Remember that you should not need to spend a great deal of money to find a good online pay stub generator. If you do your homework, you should be able to find a pay stub generator that fits within your budget. A good pay stub generator can give you the help that you will need to improve your small business.
It’s important to look at design once you have thought about your pay stub generator’s price. You will need to have a pay stub generator that is intuitive and easy to use. If a pay stub generator is confusing, you will make mistakes when you use it. In some cases, you may not want to use the generator at all. From there, you will want to assess the tax system. If you want your company to grow, you need to handle your tax liabilities. There will be significant legal consequences if you are not able to do this. Fortunately, there is a solution. A good online pay stub generator can give you the help that you will need to more efficiently administer your company’s payroll.

About a month or so ago, I read an idea about how to address car pollution (maybe it was in a book by Jane Jacobs?).
The idea was to require car manufacturers to move the exhaust pipe to go into the cabin of the car, instead of outside the car. Very quickly, a solution would be found for the pollution coming out of cars.
It's not at all unfair. It's against the law to litter and car exhaust can easily be described as a form of litter. In fact, it's also a form of assault (a very slow and drawn out assault, but it does cause harm - eventually fatal).
The more I've thought about this idea, the more sense it makes. I can't see anything unfair about it, either - whereas there is much that is unfair about the current policy and practice of allowing pollution from cars.
I figure that if we said to the car manufacturers: "In three years, you will not be permitted to have any pollutive emissions from new or refurbished cars," that they would very quickly come up with a solution.

Having just hit the milestone of serving 1,000,000 maps via HAC’s in-game downloader and serving well over 100,000 maps/month, it seems like a fitting time for a rundown of the most popular maps.
The Halo 4 medal pack has had slight adjustments to its animations and the audio files have been replaced with the high-quality originals rather than lower quality recordings than were previously used.
The Halo 3 medal pack received a small change to its script to correct an oversight (perfection can no longer be attained after a suicide or a betrayal) and a single sound file replacement.
You can download the Halo 4 medal pack here and the Halo 3 pack here. See this post if you need instructions on installing the packs.
Added a command, ‘visible_objects <number>‘, that can be used to control the number of objects drawn. Most users will have no need for this command.
Fixed a medals related bug some users were experiencing that would cause the game’s process to remain open after exiting.
Fixed a small typo that causes the Halo Reach medals script to fail when awarded the ‘Unfriggenbelievable’ medal. Download the updated script here.
Just a minor update to redirect all 1.09 clients (update to 1.10 already) to the new master server now that Gamespy has pulled the plug.
Fixed a bug with 1.10 where the draw distance wasn’t automatically being increased for certain custom maps.
For those using WINE, if you could post your distro and whether you’re using HPC or HCE in the comments, that’d be helpful.
Windows XP users will now be able to see the custom chat, although it’ll use an installedÂ typeface rather than the featured one. Â This bug is caused by Windows XP itself and there isn’t a suitable workaround (apart from getting a newer OS), although you’ll be able to select your own typefaceÂ at some point in the future.
Some maps could cause the game to crash after downloading. This was a regression (plain English: it worked, then I broke it) introduced in the January update.
This update introduces a Lua scriptable medal system. To get the ball rolling, I’ve provided three example medal packs (click to download); Halo 3, Halo Reach and Halo 4. To install a medal pack, simply download it to your HAC folder under the ‘packs’ directory (create it if it doesn’t exist) but do not extract it. For example:
The optic load command only needs to be used once. HAC will remember your preference for the next time you start the game.
Although you’re welcome to open the provided medal packs to see how I’ve done things, documentation will be forthcoming (next week, ideally).
Fixed a HUD issue where the game type icon wasn’t being scaled correctly on extremely wide resolutions.
Corrupt chat text on low-end graphics hardware. May not be able to solve this without access to a machine experiencing the problem.
Halo Chat V2 won’t work if custom_chat 1 is being used (and vice versa). This isn’t considered to be a bug, so there are no plans to fix this.

"Briefing – BDS: a Legitimate Human Rights Movement to be Respected and Protected by States" (BDS Movement, May 11, 2016): click here!
Individuals, groups, associations, local councils and public institutions participating in BDS campaigns in Palestine and elsewhere are human rights defenders. They are entitled to protection and support by governments and national authorities in accordance with the UN Declaration on Human Rights Defenders.
Belal DABOUR: "BDS doesn't hurt Palestinian settlements workers" (The New Arab, May 7, 2016): click here!
Israel claims that boycotting settlement products harms Palestinian workers, but if it leads to long-term liberation, it's a choice Palestinians should be allowed to make, writes Belal Dabour.
On February 22 of this year, the House of Commons passed a motion condemning the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement initiated in 2005 by Palestinian civil society. The BDS movement is a non-violent, global campaign which encourages organizations, activists and citizens to apply economic pressure on Israel “until Palestinian rights are recognised in full compliance with international law.”
The Alliance of Baptists is examining its investments to determine if the church has bought shares in firms profiting from the Israeli occupation. The probe follows a decision taken at the church’s annual meeting in St. Louis last month to support the Palestinian call for boycott, divestment and sanctions against Israel.
Update your wardrobe with a little help from Caro to make sure all you marvellous mums are looking your best this season... read more
Being a mum is one of the best things to happen to us women but it can also be a very time consuming and tiring job, especially when it comes to keeping ourselves looking our best. The lovely Caro from The Twinkle Dairies shows us that sometimes the infamous mum style can be fun and stylish, with a few simple pieces.
Mum style. It’s a term that gets bandied around a lot these days, isn’t it? One of the things I notice about my own style since I had my twin boys four years ago, is that there seemed to be a list of wardrobe choices that suddenly became off-limits.
I stopped wearing very pale colours and I didn’t wear too many clothes that needed dry cleaning either; why bother when there was a good chance they’d get splattered with various bodily fluids? Or, more recently, daubed with sticky fingers and hands covered in paint. Long necklaces were also one of the things to go because they always got tugged by tiny, grabbing hands.
Anything in a lacy or delicate fabric that could be pulled or easily damaged was put to one side. Bags suddenly became very practical. Gone were the sweet clutches or stylish totes that I used to carry around; instead, large and functional baby changing bags replaced them. And finally, statement sleeves that suddenly became off-limits. They were a definite no-no. The mere thought of a frilly sleeve getting caught up in any kind of nappy changing paraphernalia or dangling in the baked-bean sauce as I stacked the dishwasher was enough to make me recoil and put a self-enforced ban on an exaggerated cuff. I truly fell under the typical mum style category.
However, these days, when I am childfree for a few hours, my standard mum style changes, to include more of the things that I’ve put to one side over the last few years. Last week I had a lovely afternoon, without children, bumbling round the shops and indulging in a spot of people watching, in a café, wearing practically everything that I’ve avoided since I became a mama.
I wore a gorgeous lace blouse inky blue broderie Anglaise with the longest, laciest, frilliest statement sleeves I could find topped off with a denim jacket. And not an everyday blue denim either — oh no — this girl about town chose to wear the palest stone-coloured jacket; safe in the knowledge that no little fingers would be leaving sticky prints all over it.
I also wore the most beautiful long and delicate necklace. A length of fine silver links, beads and charms. So pretty and the kind of thing I’ve avoided over the last few years (due to fear of asphyxiation). These days, the twins are less likely to throttle me with my necklaces but are still very keen to touch and play with them. This has resulted in lots of breakages and some tears.
Finally, I ditched the changing bag in favour of something a little less utilitarian. This was perhaps my favourite exchange. No baby-wipes, odd socks or boxes of raisins. It is just a bag that contained nothing more than my phone, purse, lippy and sunglasses.
Oh, and what a bag! Bamboo handles and a daisy cutwork design that echoed the lace on my gloriously impractical sleeves.
I love being a mama. I waited for such a long time for it to happen and I cherish every day I wake up to my two tousle-haired little sons. But I also love being me. Being able to regain my sense of self and my sense of style even for just a few short hours felt very good indeed. It’s amazing how differently certain items of clothing or accessories can make you feel. I managed to create a mum style that wasn’t frumpy and unglamorous, that also worked for me.
The addition of a dainty necklace or a lacy top works wonders for the soul, as does a hot uninterrupted, cup of coffee and a giant slab of chocolate cake.
Just because you’re a mum it doesn’t mean you have to hang up your favourite impractical staples. Treat yourself to some you time, get glammed up and strut your mum style with pride!

Extended Apple care also can be purchased from USA if so desired. The following information you should find helpful. Please visit the following link for full details.
"If you seek service in a country that is not the country of original purchase, you will comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. Where international service is available, Apple may repair or exchange defective products and parts with comparable products and parts that comply with local standards. In accordance with applicable law, Apple may require that you furnish proof of purchase details and/or comply with registration requirements before receiving warranty service."
I did import a few MacBooks and loads of iPhones (when they were new on the market 3 years ago) and I never had a warranty issue.
In Germany we have by law an extended warranty of 24 months. First year is Vendor Guarantee, second year is down to the reseller or shop, who sold the product to you. But it has to be clear, that the defect has to be from the very beginning.
So, if we buy a product in Germany, then you pay the currency uplift for most of the products, but you get the "extended warranty".
If you import the product legally, then you save probably 10% over local prices. If you get around customs - which would be illegal - then you could safe another 19%.
If you live out side USA and purchase an iPAD or other Apple products please read the TERMS AND AGREEMENT on Apple's website. ( See link below) The iPad is covered by a limited international warranty. Its important to register the iPAD when you receive it and keep the receipt in case you require service.
My question is do we really need to activate AT&T in USA or just grab it and use it in Indonesia without activate it ? I heard from some people that we need to activate it in USA before took it to other country ouside USA otherwise we'll face problem to activate it using the local sim card.
I bought my IPad2 via a reseller. Receipt is not availabe, so in case of problems I would have to go through him.
If I would buy the Apple Care would this settle it? Would I then be able to go directly to the Apple store?
As far as we know, when you activate an AT&T iPad, the software expects to find an AT&T SIM card in the iPad and it takes you through the process of activating this card.
If you take your iPad back to Indonesia and put in a local SIM card, it is not clear how you would be able to negotiate this procedure. We have several Members who purchased iPads in the US and returned home with their iPads and did not activate them in the US. When they got home they were not able to activate the 3G functionality.
Thanks for the reply. But the website said that iPad 2 is unlocked. What does it mean, if we still have to activate it in USA ?

Update: Wolf2191 has corrected the absence of a Wikipedia entry for Rav Yeshayah Berlin that I had lamented in note 4.
Update II: I recently encountered a transcript of a speech by Rav Aharon Kotler, in which he takes for granted that Ya’akov’s meticulousness has aspects “that are not found in the שלחן ערוך ” and in which an employee is not obligated. As we have seen, this is the position of Rav Yeshayah Berlin, in contradistinction to that of Rav Ahai and Neziv:

Follow two families living in a Southwest desert town on the United States-Mexico border and how these two families inevitably cross and are bound by friendship and conflict.
As much as I wanted engagement pictures, we waited to add them to our package until we had a better sense of our budget. (I was really worried about going over budget!) Luckily, we can afford them. I’m thrilled because I think the pictures will be a great practice for the wedding day.
The engagement sessions package with our photographer includes a guest book for us to use at the wedding. As with our wedding photos, we will have full rights to them.
Planning for the pictures was a lot more work than I had expected. Here are the steps that need to be done:
Check out the weather. It is supposed to be in the mid-60s and partly cloudy. 20% chance of rain. Fingers are crossed.
Choose locations with photographer. Our photographer suggested Grant Park. We are also going to some places that are meaningful to us as a couple: 175 W. Jackson, Starbucks, & the el.
Choose/ buy attire. Neither me or my FI are the type to wear jeans. We are debating between wearing business casual attire or something a little more dressy. We've considered getting really dressed up but we don't want to look stuffy.
Practice beforehand. The things that I make my poor FI do! I want to make sure that he is really comfortable in front the camera.
Schedule a make-up artist. I am using a gift certifcate that I have for a free make-up session at Endo Exo.
Get a manicure and pedicue. Cute nails are a must for photos that are going to be on display at our wedding!
Lose 3lb. I know it is only 3 lb but I will feel so much better about myself if I am in my happy weight range.
Buy an umbrella. Even if it doesn't rain, an umbrella can be a great prop. I am hoping to find one with polka dots!

This blog post outlines the techniques required for the removal of HumiSeal UV cure conformal coating. The products covered in this article are:
All three methods will effectively remove the coating, depending on the process requirements, to allow individual component replacement and subsequent re-coating.
A powder abrasion system will safely and selectively remove HumiSeal UV cure conformal coatings from various components on printed circuit boards without causing any mechanical or ESD damage. The HumiSeal powder abrasion system is fully equipped with adjustable powder flow control and air pressure regulation to enable removal of the coating from pinpoint areas to larger areas. This method requires some relative dexterity as it uses high velocity particles delivered through a nozzle.
De-soldering techniques can be used to burn through or degrade a conformal coating. The temperature of the soldering iron decomposes the coating into a powdery solid that is easily removed from the substrate. This allows access to the underlying solder connections for component removal and replacement.
The temperature of the soldering tip needs to be at least at 450C. Place the tip next to the areas that need to be reworked and touch the tip on the coating surface. As HumiSeal UV coatings have excellent high temperature stability, the high temperature of the tip will only melt the coating into white solid powder rather than actually burn it.
Although fumes generated by HumiSeal UV coatings have been proven not to be harmful, adequate ventilation is recommended to dissipate any fumes generated during this process.
HumiSeal UV conformal coatings can be removed using select strippers after UV cure, before the secondary moisture mechanism has completed. See Table 1 for the appropriate stripper selection.
HumiSeal UV40, UV50LV and UV40-250 can only be removed using Stripper 1100 once the coating has been UV and moisture cured.

Aluf Benn's proposal for Israel's left to establish a base of domestic support for its positions is hopeless considering the brainwashing, ignorance, blindness, the good life, lack of opposition and increasing extremism of our society.
A single state would bury both the Palestinian national movement and the Zionist vision. People who view the boycott as 'saving Israel from itself' might find themselves living in a Masada.
When you boycott Israel, or reject the ideology on which it was founded, you are estranging yourself from much of the Jewish world.

The annual Hardware Trades Karting Challenge came into its 19th year on 2 June, when 11 teams competed for the Hardware Trades Charity Trophy to raise funds for the Rainy Day Trust.
The event, organised by Stax Trade Centres’ joint managing director David Hibbert, was held at the Speedkarting arena in Warrington, which has the longest indoor track in the UK. Competitors’ skills were strenuously tested by the Monaco-style tunnel and slingshot hairpin bends of the 3-tier circuit.
In a monumental year, the Individual event was won for the first time ever by a female driver. Trisha Seenan, who was representing Akzo Nobel’s Aces on the day, was closely followed by David Bate of the Leyland Darts and Bobby Mills from CIC.
The fastest lap was awarded to Bate, who missed out on the circuit record by just under 3 seconds, and the fastest female driver was Tasha Redman, driving for DLF Trifolium’s The Grass Karters.
PPG’s team, the Leyland Darts, came to the event with their own helmets, gloves and boots, and topped the team leader board.
The AKW Speedos crossed the line in second place, narrowly beating the Workhouse Marketing team by seconds, who finished the day in third place.
Along with the competition trophies, the Bent Axle Award was presented to Colin Burgess of the Leyland Darts for being given the only black flag of the race meeting.
Mr Hibbert said: “With a few less teams than the previous year you might be forgiven for thinking the race would be less competitive, but it was quite the opposite. An event first with Trisha Seenan winning the individual event – being the first woman ever to do so – and some incredibly fierce karting battles resulted in a fantastic day for a fantastic cause close to all our hearts in this industry. Thanks to everyone who took part and a special thanks to all our suppliers who have supported the event.”
The Rainy Day Trust helps all those who have worked in the UK’s home improvement and enhancement industry to provide support through unexpected and unpredictable events, such as ill health and financial uncertainty.
If anyone is interested in taking part in next year’s event, please contact David Hibbert on 0161 728 8000.

Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have officially shared the name of their brand new baby daughter, and the little sister to North and Saint evidently took inspiration from an American city.
Yup, Chicago West is now officially the couple's third child, Kim and Kanye announced collectively on Kim's website.
Kardashian first confirmed she was expecting a child via surrogate in a September 2017 preview of Keeping Up With The Kardashians. In the clip, Kardashian appeared on FaceTime with her sister Khloe when the conversation got serious. “What happens every time I say, ‘Guess what?’” Kim asked, to which Khloe replied, “The person’s pregnant.”
"Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl," she wrote. "We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care. North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister."
"I think if it's a boy I'll go with Junior, Tristan Jr., but for a girl I don't know where to begin," she confessed The Ellen Degeneres Show. "I want a 'K' or a 'T.'"

Stephany WESTBROOK: "Scholars in Italy debate Israel boycott despite censorship" (The Electronic Intifada, April 13, 2016): click here!
Academics in Italy held the country’s first scholarly discussions about boycott, divestment and sanctions measures on Israel in support of Palestinian rights — in spite of attempts at censorship during a major Middle East studies conference in Sicily.
As feminist scholars, activists, teachers, and public intellectuals we recognize the interconnectedness of systemic forms of oppression. In the spirit of this perspective, we cannot overlook the injustice and violence, including sexual and gender-based violence, perpetrated against Palestinians and other Arabs in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, within Israel and in the Golan Heights, as well as the colonial displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the 1948 Nakba.
...the absence of professional organizations representing scientists is hard to miss. The failure of the campus’s other half to engage collectively in any way with the growing movement contrasts sharply with the situation in the spring of 2002, when, in the wake of the Israeli reoccupation of the West Bank, two petitions, precursors of the BDS movement, were initiated by scientists in Britain and France and collected hundreds of signatures.
"European call: Stop the criminalisation of the BDS movement for justice in Palestine! Support grassroots human rights activists across Europe!" (European Coordination of Committees and Associations for Palestine, April 12, 2016): click here!
As Israel is increasingly unable to defend its regime of apartheid and settler colonialism over the Palestinian people and its regular massacres of Palestinians in Gaza, it is seeking supportive governments in Europe and the US to undermine free speech as a way of shielding it from criticism and measures aimed at holding it to account for its gross violations of international law.

Omar BARGHOUTI: "Israeli Ministers Call For "Civil Targeted Killing" of BDS Activists" (The Citizen, April 3): click here!
As was reported in the Israeli media, Israeli Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz said (Hebrew) at the largest Israeli anti-BDS conference, held ​on ​March 28 in Jerusalem, that Israel should engage in “targeted civil eliminations” of BDS "leaders" with the help of Israeli intelligence, intentionally using language that plays on the Hebrew term for “targeted assassinations.” My name was mentioned in this context.
Richard SILVERSTEIN: "Israeli Minster Calls for “Civil Targeted Killings” of BDS Leaders". (Tikun Olam, March 30, 2016: click here!
The Yediot Achronot conference attacking BDS has become a veritable carnival of hate. Everyone from delusional Hollywood celebrities (Roseanne Barr) to cabinet ministers, to the leader of the Opposition have pledged fealty to the cause. Two of the speakers are under criminal investigation for corrupt political or financial dealings.
The first ever anti-BDS conference in Israel brought together politicians of all stripes to show their commitment to the fight against boycotts. In doing so, however, they showed just how effective the boycott movement really is.

“The European Union has once again abandoned its own policies that consider Israel’s settlements illegal. By failing to vote at the UN Human Rights Council for establishing a UN registry of companies implicated in Israel’s occupation regime and by joining the far-right Israeli government’s fight against BDS, the largest nonviolent Palestinian-led human rights movement, the EU is underlining its already well-known hypocrisy and declaring its disregard for human rights.”
"Boycotting Israel is a free speech right". Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions National Committee (BNC) (The Electronic Intifada, March 18, 2016): click here!
Efforts by the Palestinian-led boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement to hold Israel accountable for its serious violations of international law and to end international complicity in these violations are more widely supported and impactful than ever before.
The main objective behind BDS, an entirely non-violent movement that is championed by civil society across the globe, is not to punish ordinary Israelis, but to raise awareness of the suffering of Palestinians and to create a moral threshold that must be achieved if a just peace is ever to be realized.
Perspectives of a Canadian in the Old/Deep/New/Geographic South: This is where I ramble on about nothing in particular and post a few nice pictures.
What is it about people that makes them think they can make others responsible for their own stupidity? More and more now, you read in the news about someone suing some company or another for something stupid that they did. All because they think it's someone else's fault. True Stella Awards has loads of stories like this.
This morning I was reading in the paper about Phillip Morris settling a case for $2M because some woman left a burning cigarette between the front seats of her car resulting in her daughter getting burned by the subsequent fire. A tragic accident yes, but I fail to see how PM would be responsible for her stupidity for leaving a burning cigarette anywhere other than the ashtray of her car.
Now I'm not advocating PM or anything, or any of their products (especiallyl cigarettes). I just think that in this particular case (granted that I know very little of the details), PM shouldn't have settled. Even though there was no explicit acknowledgement of responsibility, settling out of court always seems to imply responsibility.
People need to take responsibility for their actions and choices, and the consequences and results of those actions. Making other people take the blame for your own stupidity sends society into a rapid downward spiral that benefits nobody except lawyers.

Abu Hamza al-Misri, or Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, was born in Alexandria, Egypt. He is 48 years old. In 1979, he came to London intending to become a civil engineer. He studied in Brighton, and later worked as a doorman in the West End. Abu Hamza married Valerie Fleming in 1981 and received his British citizenship. However, they divorced five years later. In May 2004, Abu Hamza was arrested on an extradition request by the US government, and was detained at Belmarsh High Security Prison. The US wants to extradite him over allegations of hostage taking in Yemen and supporting terrorism. The FBI is thought to have built a case against him using information from James Ujaama, who was imprisoned in the US and then released after signing a plea agreement. Abu Hamza had been a regular preacher at the Finsbury Park mosque until he was banned by the Charity Commission in February 2003. Extradition proceedings to the US were put on hold in October 2004, when he was to face terrorism charges in the UK. On 19 October 2004, Abu Hamza was charged with 16 offences. He faces 10 charges of soliciting to murder under section four of the Offences Against the Person Act of 1861. Four charges were brought of using threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour with intent to stir up racial hatred. He is also accused under section 58 of the Terrorism Act of possessing a document which contained information "of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism". It was reported in March 2005 that Abu Hamza was assaulted by an inmate. He was allegedly hit while detained in the segregation unit, and claims it was an attempt on his life. He also claims he is being victimised by prison officers, and is compiling a dossier of alleged incidents.
Abu Hamza suffers from diabetes, has no hands and is blinded in one eye. He is also covered from head to foot in scabs because he has an ailment that makes his skin bleed. He has been repeatedly refused heating when requested and refused blankets to keep him warm. The heating in his cell gets deliberately switched off leaving the cell extremely cold. This leaves him exposed to the cold for long periods contributing to sleep deprivation. He is even being put into situations where he is made to sleep on the floor. Other complaints include problems when visiting the toilet, especially when his deteriorating health frequently makes him ill. Any utilities and prosthetic arms Hamza had in order that he can conduct a normal life have been taken away. Medication is either refused or not given on time, hence affecting his health. It has been reported that inmates are encouraged to intimidate him and to attack him.
Boston Children’s Museum is the second oldest, and one of the most influential children’s museums in the world. It was founded in 1913 by the Science Teachers' Bureau, a group of visionary educators dedicated to providing new resources for both teachers and students, as a center for the exchange of materials and ideas to advance the teaching of science. For over 100 years it has been engaging children in joyful discovery experiences that instill an appreciation of our world, develop foundational skills, and spark a lifelong love of learning.
The Museum’s exhibits and programs emphasize hands-on engagement and learning through experience, employing play as a tool to spark the inherent creativity, curiosity, and imagination of children. Designed for children and families, Museum exhibits focus on science, culture, environmental awareness, health & fitness, and the arts. In addition to extensive child-centered exhibits, Museum educators develop numerous programs and activities that address literacy, performing arts, science and math, visual arts, cultures, and health and wellness. The Museum is also one of the few children’s museums in the world to maintain a collection. The Museum’s collections of Americana, Natural History, Global Culture, Native American, Dolls and Dollhouses, and Japanese artifacts encompass more than 50,000 items.
As one of the largest children’s museums in the world, Boston Children’s Museum also provides museum consulting services and creates award winning traveling exhibits, staff training curriculum, and exhibit kits for Museum professionals.

Anyone who’s ever been to the track knows that racetracks are loud. Quite frankly, it’s one of the things many people (including me) like about actually being at the track as opposed to watching on television. But could that noise be doing your hearing permanent damage? Is it any worse than any of the other sounds we encounter on a daily basis?
TL;DR: No. As the extent of Kyle Busch’s injury Saturday evening at Daytona became evident, Twitter erupted in angry calls for SAFER barriers to be put up on every wall at every track. An interesting division of sides appeared. A small number of people cautioned that simply plastering every track with…

SpaceX’s Starlink aims to put over a thousand of its communications satellites in super-low orbit – TechCrunch - Amtrea
SpaceX’s planned communication satellite constellation, known as Starlink, will now be targeting a much lower orbit than originally planned, at least for over a thousand of the satellites, the company revealed in an FCC filing. The move should help mitigate orbital debris and provide better signal for the company’s terrestrial users as well.
Starlink plans to put 1,584 satellites — about a third of the 4,409 the company aims to launch — in an orbit just 550 kilometers about the surface of the Earth. For comparison, many communications satellites are in orbits more than twice as high, and geosynchronous orbits are more than 20 times farther out (around 36,000 miles).
At that distance orbits decay quickly, falling into the atmosphere and burning up after a handful of years. But SpaceX isn’t daunted; in fact, it writes in its application, lower orbits offer “several attractive features both during nominal operation and in the unlikely event something goes wrong.”
In the first place, orbital debris problems are naturally mitigated by the fact that anything in that low orbit will fall to Earth quickly instead of cluttering up the orbit. Second, it should shorten the amount of time it takes to send and receive a signal from the satellites — ping time could be as low as 15 milliseconds, the company estimated. And 500 fewer kilometers means there will be less spreading for beam-based communications, as well.
The satellites will have to do more work to stay at their optimal altitude, as atmospheric drag will be higher, and each one will be able to see and serve less of the planet. But with thousands working together, that should be manageable.
The decision was informed by experimental data from the “Tintin” test satellites the company launched earlier this year. “SpaceX has learned to mitigate the disadvantages of operating at a lower altitude and still reap the well-known and significant benefits discussed above,” it wrote.
This change could lead to competitive advantages when satellite communications are more widely used, but it will also likely lead to a more intensive upkeep operation as Starlink birds keep dropping out of the air. Fortunately a third benefit of the lower orbit is that it’s easier to reach, though probably not so much easier that the company breaks even.
Starlink is aiming for the first real launches of its systems early next year, though that timeline may be a little too ambitious. But SpaceX can do ambitious.

this blog loads a lot faster then most. Can you recommend a good internet hosting provider at a fair price?
Greetings from Colorado! I’m bored to death at work so I decided to check out your blog on my iphone during lunch break.
Howdy, i read your blog occasionally and i own a similar one and i was just wondering if you get a lot of spam responses?

I discussed this responsum in a Reading Responsa lecture several months ago; it, along with its accompanying handout, is available at the Internet Archive. At the time, I was ignorant of Rambam’s comments on the episode of the son of the woman of Sarepta, although I was aware of some controversy over what exactly had transpired in that incident:

This single is from my NEW CD Title “I`M Glad” This one is for everyone that have a wife, or girl friend, or engaged, you should be glad, for that special someone in their lives, I dedicate this song to behalf of all the men to their special lady!
Friends words cannot explain about this single on my new CD I`M Glad, Please read some Review, First song," He Didn't Die."
First, let me say I love the rhythm and the funky groove! This song has a joyful, happy, fun sound from the beginning and the drums/bass are so nice. The words and the vocals are a good marriage, and pleasing to the ears. Letting the listener know that Jesus died for them, for everyone is a powerful message... The song could perhaps benefit by having a classical guitar in the mix, and a nice "solo"/interlude would make this song even sweeter than it is... My overall reaction to this song is "thumb's up". I would like to hear more of the song in it's entirety. This song is a great gospel song for all people regardless of their musical tastes... It makes me want to dance before the Lord! Keep up the great work. Michael D'Aigle

The ChişinEU – POETIC INTERVENTIONS action is part of an attempt to radiography Chisinau’s public space through the light of artistic interventions, in which the participants in the action were encouraged to take hold of several streets segments, as well as texts and inscriptions on the facades of buildings, billboards or other surfaces, visible to the city’s inhabitants. Public space had an important role in the process of accumulating texts and other materials, being a primary source of information and influencing capitally the content of the works that the participants in the action produced later. Strolling through Chisinau, in a process of exploring the city, they became preoccupied with extracting information and writing texts, and their bodies joined a process of activating the space through which they moved, transforming it in a space of message production and dissemination.
The three journeys taken by the artists, writers and poets allowed them to familiarize better with the city and its specificity, offering a frame for information acquiring. They outlined a direct method for exploring the political, but also the social and economical, inscribed on the walls’ facades and in the anonymous inscriptions found along the three main city highways, selected according to a specific objective.
One of the action’s aims was to identify messages that the inhabitants of Chisinau conceived and expressed by the means of words and texts inscribed in public spaces; these were supposed to be collected (recuperated) as sources and raw material. During the examination of Chisinau streets and boulevards, the participants remarked a severe lack of voice and expression on the part of the city’s inhabitants, these being in some cases jammed, and in other – replaced by painted boards and advertisings belonging to various local – or, more often, foreign – companies.
At the same time, the layering of different discourses and types of messages could be observed and promoted depending on their particularities, without them intertwining in any way, making thus manifest the lack of almost any communication between the government representatives, private companies and civil society or simple citizens, which proves that Chisinau public space is visibly marked by the interests of some investors and commercial structures, but also by the interests of political groups that, for the most part, exclude the city inhabitants from configuring it according to their needs and specifics.
The present publication aims at reintroducing the citizens’ voice in the public circuit, by the means of texts written by participants in ChişinEU – POETIC INTERVENTIONS project.
In April 2010, an ash cloud generated by a volcano whose name only Icelandic speakers can pronounce correctly, paralyzed Europe. At the other end of the continent, 10 poets embarked on a search for poetry in the cloud of public inscriptions that Chisinau’s inhabitants can tell better, beyond the clouds covering them, either from the East, or from the West.
And all this happened only in order to find the meeting point between poetry and the voices from today’s Chisinau streets. We didn’t have to search for too long. Still, it is the city where M. Eminescu and V. Micle meet even now, just between August, 31 and Stefan cel Mare Bd.
We mapped only three streets, with historical names for Chisinau: Dacia Boulevard, from the city gates until MallDova, Moscow Boulevard, which goes up to the North-East of the Capital, and The Iasi Highway, which goes slightly down to the West. On each street you can find the whole city, the same way in a city you can meet the whole world. With all its political motivations: both the one belonging to romance, and the one influenced by the economic and, inevitably, the political motivation included in gastronomy.
The poetic map of Chisinau is now in the hands of anyone who wants to develop it further, and the bird profile that the Moldovan city sketches on any map is ready now to fly towards the readers.
As long as there is no political or diplomatic horizon, as long as the power dynamic allows Israel to dictate the terms of any negotiations, as long as the occupation seems hopelessly unending, BDS is one of the most powerful non-violent tools available for Palestinians to fight for their fundamental rights, and for enlisting allies around the world to fight alongside them.
In conclusion, whether or not one supports BDS, we commend the McGill students who voted in favour of BDS for standing up against repression in the face of increasing attempts by governments and other organisations to spread vilifying misinformation about the movement. Any statement about academic freedom in the context of Israel-Palestine must absolutely take into account that academic freedom is blatantly violated for Palestinian faculty and students every day.

Steven BOTTICELLI: "Over 300 psychotherapists oppose holding annual research conference in Jerusalem" (Mondoweiss, March 10, 2016): click here!
The usually quiescent world of psychotherapy has been struck by a blast of anti-occupation activism, in the form of a petition signed by over 300 psychotherapists opposing the choice of The Society for Psychotherapy Research (SPR) to hold its annual meeting in Jerusalem this June.
"Protect Your Right To Boycott: Anti-BDS Legislation by [US] State" (righttoboycott.org): click here!
These bills are the result of a campaign to suppress Palestine human rights activism in the U.S. Israel's interest in restricting this activism should not override our right to advocate for change.
Asa WINSTANLEY: "Has the UK really banned boycotts?" (The Electronic Intifada, March 7, 2016): click here!
In a statement sent to The Electronic Intifada, London Palestine Action said the Department for Communities and Local Government was engaging in “smoke and mirrors” and that the much-touted “boycott ban” was more of an attempt to intimidate than an actual ban.
It’s not anti-Semitism that makes pro-Israel Jewish students at Vassar feel uncomfortable, it’s anti-Zionism, sometimes championed by fellow Jews.
Jonathan COOK: "﻿Emerging from a ‘reign of terror’: Palestinians in Israel hold first BDS conference" (J.C.: The View from Nazareth, March 3, 2016): click here!
Israel’s large Palestinian minority held its first-ever conference on BDS – boycott, divestment and sanctions – this past weekend in spite of anti-boycott legislation introduced five years ago that exposes activists in Israel to harsh financial penalties.
Regardless of one’s views of BDS, it is ridiculous that one should have to tell self-proclaimed ‘democracies’ that the right to boycott is a basic civil right, not a punishable crime.
"Mental health professionals protest decision to hold conference in Jerusalem" (MEMo, March 2, 2016): click here!
Over 140 psychotherapists, researchers and other mental health professionals have written an open letter to the Society for Psychotherapy Research (SPR) to express dismay at its decision to hold its next international conference in Jerusalem.
Browsers are a really nice target for attackers of all stripes and skill levels. But, unless you're a savant or have just landed here from the future, you may want to take a pass on going after Google Chrome, judging by the insane level of effort and skill that an anonymous security researcher had to deploy in order to compromise Chrome during the company's Pwnium contest in March.
The researcher who received one of two $60,000 rewards handed out by Google for full sandbox escapes and compromises of Chrome during the contest used the alias Pinkie Pie. At the time that his accomplishment was announced during the CanSecWest conference in March, Google officials did not specify exactly how the researcher had been able to break Chrome's many layers of security, but just said that he had used multiple bugs to do it.
Now, Google security researchers have revealed the method and techniques that Pinkie Pie used, and if anything, the whole story is even more impressive than observers had thought at the time of the contest. Pinkie Pie used a total of six vulnerabilities in various components of Chrome, chaining them together in a long sequence that eventually enabled him to break out of the Chrome sandbox and completely compromise the browser.
The first part of this long process was exploiting a bug in the way that Chrome uses pre-rendering to handle Native Client content on Web pages.
"Prerendering is a performance optimization that lets a site provide hints for Chrome to fetch and render a page before the user navigates to it, making page loads seem instantaneous. To avoid sound and other nuisances from preloaded pages, the prerenderer blocks plug-ins from running until the user chooses to navigate to the page. Pinkie discovered that navigating to a pre-rendered page would inadvertently run all plug-ins—even Native Client plug-ins, which are otherwise permitted only for installed extensions and apps," Google's Jorge Lucangeli Obes and Justin Schuh said in an analysis of the attack.
"Of course, getting a Native Client plug-in to execute doesn’t buy much, because the Native Client process’ sandbox is even more restrictive than Chrome’s sandbox for HTML content. What Native Client does provide, however, is a low-level interface to the GPU command buffers, which are used to communicate accelerated graphics operations to the GPU process. This allowed Pinkie to craft a special command buffer to exploit the following integer underflow bug (117656) in the GPU command decoding."
Once he had control of the GPU process, Pinkie Pie needed to find a target for his overwrite. He need the target to be something that was worth his effort to modify, so he went after the GPU buckets.
"For this, he used the GPU buckets, which are another IPC primitive exposed from the GPU process to the Native Client process. The buckets are implemented as a tree structure, with the first eight bytes containing pointers to other nodes in the tree. By overwriting the first eight bytes of a bucket, Pinkie was able to point it to a fake tree structure he created in one of his transfer buffers. Using that fake tree, Pinkie could read and write arbitrary addresses in the GPU process. Combined with some predictable addresses in Windows, this allowed him to build a ROP chain and execute arbitrary code inside the GPU process," the Google analysis said.
"The GPU process is still sandboxed well below a normal user, but it’s not as strongly sandboxed as the Native Client process or the HTML renderer. It has some rights, such as the ability to enumerate and connect to the named pipes used by Chrome’s IPC layer. Normally this wouldn’t be an issue, but Pinkie found that there’s a brief window after Chrome spawns a new renderer where the GPU process could see the renderer’s IPC channel and connect to it first, allowing the GPU process to impersonate the renderer (bug 117627)."
From there, Pinkie was able to find another bug in one of Chrome's renderers that gave him the ability to access a privileged renderer through an unprivileged one, something that should not have been possible. He used that flaw to gain access to the extension manager inside the browser, and then impersonate that process. Then came the hard part: breaking out of the Chrome sandbox.
"Once he was impersonating the extensions manager, Pinkie used two more bugs to finally break out of the sandbox. The first bug (117715) allowed him to specify a load path for an extension from the extension manager’s renderer, something only the browser should be allowed to do. The second bug (117736) was a failure to prompt for confirmation prior to installing an unpacked NPAPI plug-in extension. With these two bugs Pinkie was able to install and run his own NPAPI plug-in that executed outside the sandbox at full user privilege," Google said.

Due to their nature, fork bombs can be difficult to stop once started. Stopping a fork bomb from reproducing further requires the termination of all running copies, which can be difficult to achieve. One problem faced is that a separate program to terminate the fork bomb cannot execute if the process table is fully saturated. The second major problem is that in the time taken between finding the processes to terminate and actually terminating them, more may have been created.
bomb(){ bomb | bomb &}; bomb The fork bomb in this case is a recursive function that runs in the background, thanks to the ampersand operator. This ensures that the child process does not die and keeps forking new copies of the function, consuming system resources.
You'll need a Wii remote or "Wiimote" to start with. Normally they are about $40, in the end that is not too bad for a pretty awesome sensor. Otherwise you can check out ebay or elsewhere for used or broken Wii remotes.
You'll need to rip apart the case. It has some crazy three pronged screws. I didn't want to completely trash the case so I made a small tool to take it apart.
Now you need to desolder the 8 pins and the 2 struts holding the camera on the board. I used some desoldering braid. It wicks the solder away and makes it easy to get the camera out. Be careful, don't break the camera!
You might want to keep the rest of the parts. You might be able to scrap other parts. Also, If you decide later to use the Wiimote again, you could always put the camera back in.

I'm deep into NaNo this month on a new book, so here's a dip into the archives for one of my favorites. Enjoy!
Some writers craft meticulous settings and build an amazing worlds, while others use the minimal details to suggest a place. But no matter what kind of story you write, it takes place somewhere. Maybe it's a small room, a town, or even a galaxy. What's more, setting can be a backdrop or a character in the novel. It's versatile!
But what if you're not sure where to set your novel? Then here are a few questions you can ask to find the right setting for your story:
If you’ve always loved a particular location, that passion will spill over into your novel’s setting. A favorite city could be the perfect place for your characters to live. If there’s no specific place, something more general like the beach or the mountains could work as well.
If you want a dark and creepy novel, odds are you won’t set it on a bright and sunny beach. (or maybe you will, because you'll want the contrast) The atmosphere of a place bleeds into the story and will either enhance the mood, or give all the wrong signals if it’s conflicting with what you envision.
If most of the novels in your genre are set in small towns, that’s a pretty good indication that readers expect and look forward to this setting. But that doesn’t mean you have to go with the norm. Do you want a similar setting or something new? Maybe a compromise with a slight twist to what is common for the genre.
If your story is about the effects of war, setting it in the middle of a war gives you a lot to work with. If the theme is love, setting it in the most romantic city in the world might be a solid idea. You might even want to flip it and use the setting to show what’s lacking in that conflict or theme, like having a love story set in a land of war and hatred.
Odds are you have things you know you want from your setting. Perhaps they’re plot elements, or character history, or even a social construct you want to explore. If there’s something critical about your world and setting, make sure you choose a place that will reflect that.
You might want the reader to bring her own memories and views of a real place to the story, or you might want to create an entirely make believe world. A fantasy realm, a distant planet, or even a small town that doesn’t actually exist. Real places might require a little more research to ensure you’re not getting facts wrong, but they also bring a sense of realism to the story. A made up place gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, though it might take more work to build that world.
Consider the scope of your setting. Maybe you want a small town, or just a small room. You might want the story to spread across continents or galaxies.
Big cities offer things rural places don’t and vice versa. Even if your setting is made up, you have options on how metropolitan it will be.
A setting feels differently to someone who’s live there her whole life versus a newcomer. Do you want the reader to feel like a newcomer as well, or like a native?
You might choose to set the novel in your hometown, or pick a place you’ve always wanted to visit. Knowing the locale might be easier to write, though you might also feel the need to get every detail exact (which can bog you down). The freedom to explore a new location could spark excitement and make the setting come alive, (though you could get details wrong and have readers call you on it.)
The setting brings so much to a story, it's worth taking time to find the one that best enhances that story.
Go step-by-step through setting and description-related issues, such as weak world building, heavy infodumping, told prose, awkward stage direction, inconsistent tone and mood, and overwritten descriptions. Learn how to analyze your draft, spot any problems or weak areas, and fix those problems.
With clear and easy-to-understand examples, Fixing Your Setting & Description Problems offers five self-guided workshops that target the common issues that make readers stop reading. It will help you:
Fixing Setting & Description Problems starts every workshop with an analysis to pinpoint problem areas and offers multiple revision options in each area. You choose the options that best fit your writing process. It's an easy-to-follow guide to crafting immersive settings and worlds that draw readers into your story and keep them there.

Great things to consider, Janice. I still remember how you shared about picking the setting for The Shifter. I think it was awesome how you picked some of a real setting that had what you were looking for and used it to create the setting for your story.
Natalie, thanks! It's my lazy side that take over there, but it does provide a nice foundation. Anything that makes the process easier is good!
I prefer to use a setting that I know. Being a hobby writer, I prefer to spend my limited time writing rather than researching (and research is my job, so I get plenty of it anyway; science I mean)
Keri kicked off her shoes and dug her toes into the sand. Focusing on the almost-unendurable heat rising from the beach might keep the scream down. Maybe.
Her friends dropped their gear in a heap. “C’mon, let’s go in!” Veronica dashed off towards the waves.
“I’ll watch our stuff.” Keri waved weakly as they ran off, laughing. The brutal sun pounded down on her head, driving her to the ground. She hunched inside her hoodie. Maybe she could give herself heatstroke and have an excuse to go home.
Keri frowned as her eyes swept up and down the narrow strip of sand, taking in the relaxed, smiling beachgoers. There was nowhere safe to look. This direction: her friends about to get slammed by a monster wave and sucked out with the undertow. That direction: little kids flirting with the water’s edge, parents yards away and yakking over sangria. Further on: a stone-still lifeguard lounging on her perch, probably asleep behind her mirrored shades. Beside her: a lipstick-red woman courting melanoma. Keri closed her eyes. All she needed now were some circling shark fins to make the horror complete.
Something purple washed up beside a toddler. Keri was on her feet before she knew it. She grabbed the kid’s shovel, flipped the Portugese man o’ war into the rocks at the base of the breakwater and thrust the shovel back at the now-wailing child.
Laura opened the door slowly, her right eye twitching slightly at the screeching hinges. She hoped the sound of the shower drowned out that noise, but she wasn’t deterred. Then the smell of freshly sprayed, canned cinnamon and apple slapped her in the face. At least it did its job she thought, giggling slightly before she could help herself. Throwing a hand up to cover her mouth, she looked into the mirror of the oak medicine cabinet, watching his form behind the light blue curtain. He made no noise in response and his movements didn’t stop. He hadn’t heard her. She let out the breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding and continued into the room. The cool grey tile chilled her; she looked down at her exposed flesh, knowing he would be pleased. The confidence she normally lacked was bursting from her thanks to the two sea breezes she’d consumed. She was unapologetic for at being a cheap date. The water shut off abruptly, causing her panic in the unplanned silence. Unsure of what to do next, she sat on the only thing there was to sit down on. Turning sideways, she crossed her legs and let her blonde hair spill over a shoulder.
CA Heaven, smart. Knowing what you want out of your writing and work goes a long way to knowing how much time to spend on what. Saves you a lot of worry, too!
The water dulled each grain of sand to blunt redundancy. As numerous as the stars in the sky and burning as hot as a dying supernova. The heat lay like a shroud over anything that made a sound. Even the insects only dared sing in pianissmo minor tones. A trail of clouds strangled the horizon line where the last crimson stain of sun was vanishing into the ocean. The palm trees bowed their leaves in defeat to the oncoming darkness. Not even a wind to breathe life back into them.
Broken glass circled a rock at the border between beach and cement. It would turn to sand, one day, if given the chance. But the resort staff would dispose of it before it had the chance to attain that potential. Instead it was just another broken dream.
The flowers all looked up at the sky. As if in disdain of their surroundings. Elitists who whispered amongst each other about the ugly scars of humanity all around them. They knew the secret to simplicity but kept silent for the pleasure of seeing humanity suffer.
Empty beach chairs sat straight-backed under folded umbrellas. Each one’s age evident by the sag where a thousand people had sat. Leaving the weight of their troubles behind on the sun-bleached plastic. A few discarded chairs had broken under the burden.
He looked at the crumbled pink slip in his hand. He didn’t know why he thought he could escape it here.
For setting, I just pick a general location and then roam around a tour book until I find something that catches my eye as a potential place. It doesn't have to be a place I've been. Part of the fun is being a book tourist. For a story I'm researching now, I picked the location because I wanted fog for the story.
But I'm also a lazy researcher. I don't want to research the setting as if I were doing a term paper. I pick a couple of good tour books -- what are the unusual features, what animals and plants are there, etc. Older Google free books can also be sometimes helpful. I got some really great descriptions of how the sea behaves in that area from a county history. I also look for photos of the place to help me build on the setting.
I've recently been experimenting with picking a date in history for the story and researching the weather. This is NOT for the .1 percent of the readers who will nitpick the story, but to make me pay attention to the details that I'm likely to miss entirely. It forces me to make a conscious decision about time of the year and think about if it's cold or hot or windy (time of the year is important to get the fog). For my Point Reyes research, I also checked when low and high tide was because that would make a difference in a key piece of the story.
BTW, none of this is complicated. I probably took 2-3 hours on the research, mainly because I want to have enough that I could reuse the research on future projects.
I would not, could not let go of her hand. The lights glared down from on high. Exposed. Nowhere to hide. The hairs on my skin stood to attention at the sound of the click clacking approach of no nonsense heels. Escape – now, before the woman arrived. I turned to the door. Too late. Through the heavy frosted glass panel I saw her, a vast figure silhouetted by the florescent lights. She threw back the door and I gagged as the smell of hospital grade disinfectant assailed my nostrils. “Good morning!”
I mumbled a reply. It was all too soon, a mistake, it hadn’t really been my choice after all, to be here now gripping the little hand in mine.
The paper work all signed at the front desk. I was committed now. I squinted into the corners of the ceiling, searched for a dark recess at the edge of the room; nothing, no dark space or quiet corner to hide in, no den to retreat to. No unseen space to call my own. Correction, her own.
The floor tiles are too white and the furniture too colourful l. I am reminded of the time my technicolour vomit sprayed across Aunt Stella’s stark minimalist bathroom. (Five years old – too many lollies.)
The little hand tugs in mine, pulling away. “Hello. I’m Zoe.” My daughter addresses the woman with confidence. Distant squeals reach our ears. Freed from my grip she darts into the bright independent world of the pre-school centre.
Linda, love the term "book tourist." I also love the weather tip! What a great way to get into the feel of a setting from a unique angle. It's the small things that can really bring a setting to life. Fantastic ideas.
The rainbow of colors blurs in my eyes. The sun has freshly risen, drowning us in light and brilliance. The pimpled hills shimmer with color and plastic. Behind them towers rugged rock, torn bare by the wind. The valley is empty, echoing with the crunching of our steps.
“The boarding house is getting full,” he says, peeling his hand away from mine to pluck a pink baggie from the ground. His fingers play around with silver ring inside it.
My eyes float past the hill, and a spear of sunlight curls around my head, blindfolding me. Everything under our feet glows.
“We need one more room.” I’m caught in the web of his eyes again– gray and warm. Soft like a bird’s fuzz. Fringed with black lashes. “I was thinking you could move out of yours.”
“Move where?” My voice flies over the polka dotted hills. It's so quiet, only the rustling of leaves and grass behind us brushing in my ears.
Two flies buzz around a rotten rose that’s squished between grimy garbage bags. My face crunches up at the repugnant smell blown into my face by the wind. Then I catch the spiciness of his cologne.
“It’s not supposed to be crazy. It’s supposed to be a marriage proposal.” That’s when he squelches down on one knee.
People like to say that small children see their parents as saints. And for the most part that might be true, but Maxwell knew from the age of five and a half years old his parents where hardly higher than the dirt that liked to stick to his clothes and get him in trouble. From the age of 8, he knew what the word alcoholic meant, and by the time he was 10 he knew how to pay for a weeks worth of food with just fifteen dollars. The dysfunctional family lived in a miniscule house that was painted an awful shade of yellow. The inside wasn’t much better, what with peeling wallpaper and the always present smell of cigarette smoke that liked to stick to Max’s clothing and never leave. The electric bills were never paid, neither where the water bills. The only thing that kept them from getting evicted entirely was that the landlord didn't give a damn about this house.
I'm also on the same NaNoWriMo path as you are and the words come in a hurry or they come like giving birth......which I guess is what it is. Happy writing Janice, I'll think of you at your keyboard (nearly said typewriter!!) whilst I'm at mine. Jan

Summertime comes along with a lot of fun and activities that can be enjoyed inside the waters. You probably are a business that looks to cash in heavily during this incredible period. Well, one of the business opportunities you can take advantage of would be having plenty of boats for sale. However, before going into the market, you should be aware of the boats you want to sell. This is a guideline that will inform you about the boats you should look to sell during summer:
Personal Water Craft (PWC) – This should probably be the very first boat on your list. The vessel is highly preferred by people because it is economical and fun to drive. Initially, they were designed to fit either one or two people. However, bigger and more powerful models can accommodate up to four people in one trip. The personal watercraft comes in different lengths and sizes. The boat is highly sought after by those who enjoy both speed and thrill in the waters.
Cruisers—Cruiser boats are ideally designed for those looking to spend either a day or night in the waters. The vessels are bigger in length with enough space that can be used for an enclosed head, some berths as well as a small galley. They also have a cabin where people can relax to keep away from the scorching sun or the cold night breeze. Such a boat can be ideal for a family looking to have some quality time deep in the waters.
Ski Boats – Ski boats are perfectly designed and customised for people who enjoy skiing. They can also be used as family boats as they come with adequate space to fit at most six people. The boats are comfortable and have accessories such as ski-lockers which can come quite in handy while skiing. They also offer maximum speed for perfect skiing thus making the experience fun and memorable.
Pontoon Boats – These boats are excellent for a family which requires some quality time in the waters to connect and have fun. They are made from sturdy pontoons which can adequately support their broad platform. They also possess shallow drafts which play a great role in their stability. The boats can be found in small water bodies where they are used for fishing as well as cruising. For their power requirements, the pontoon boats use either a stern-drive or an outboard.
Hey! My name is Ella and I would like to tell you about the fantastic weekends I have been having ever since I met my amazing boyfriend Simon. Before I met Simon, I was one of the least active people in the world. I would love to sit around all day watching my favourite TV shows. However, all of that changed. On our first date, Simon took me to a tennis court and taught me how to play. The following weekend, he took me deep sea fishing in a boat. Next week, I don't know what we will be doing but it will be a lot of fun. I decided to start this blog to share my new found passion for recreational activities.

Known principally for his weekly political columns and his commentaries on radio and television, Chris Trotter has spent most of his adult life either engaging in or writing about politics. He was the founding editor of The New Zealand Political Review (1992-2005) and in 2007 authored No Left Turn, a political history of New Zealand. Living in Auckland with his wife and daughter, Chris describes himself as an “Old New Zealander” – i.e. someone who remembers what the country was like before Rogernomics. He has created this blog as an archive for his published work and an outlet for his more elegiac musings. It takes its name from Bowalley Road, which runs past the North Otago farm where he spent the first nine years of his life. Enjoy.
The blogosphere tends to be a very noisy, and all-too-often a very abusive, place. I intend Bowalley Road to be a much quieter, and certainly a more respectful, place.
So, if you wish your comments to survive the moderation process, you will have to follow the Bowalley Road Rules.
Comments which are defamatory, vituperative, snide or hurtful will be removed, and the commentators responsible permanently banned.
Anonymous comments will not be published. Real names are preferred. If this is not possible, however, commentators are asked to use a consistent pseudonym.
Comments which are thoughtful, witty, creative and stimulating will be most welcome, becoming a permanent part of the Bowalley Road discourse.
However, I do add this warning. If the blog seems in danger of being over-run by the usual far-Right suspects, I reserve the right to simply disable the Comments function, and will keep it that way until the perpetrators find somewhere more appropriate to vent their collective spleen.
‘WE HAVE MAINTAINED a silence closely resembling stupidity." Do you remember who said that – and when?
The words belong to Neil Roberts, New Zealand’s only suicide bomber. He spray painted them on a toilet wall shortly before blowing himself to pieces outside the Wanganui Computer Centre on 18 November 1982.
Thirty years ago, when personal computers and cell-phones were still in their infancy, the Wanganui Computer Centre loomed large in New Zealanders’ imagination as the ultimate symbol of the "Big Brother" state.
Fourteen months after the massive upheavals of the Springbok Tour, and just 9 days shy of the first anniversary of Rob Muldoon’s re-election, the 22-year-old anarchist and punk rocker, despairing of his fellow citizens’ commitment to freedom and democracy, detonated a carry-bag-full of high explosive directly outside the Wanganui Computer Centre’s front doors.
While Neil Robert’s acute depression found an extreme form of self-expression, he was by no means the only person alienated from New Zealand society under Rob Muldoon.
Paradoxically, the supreme effort of the preceding year, when tens of thousands of Kiwis rose up against the suffocating conservatism of the Muldoonist regime, had only made things worse. For young idealists like Roberts it seemed as though the country had turned a corner. But, almost as soon as the Springboks boarded their flight to Johannesburg, the great tide of anger and frustration which their visit had occasioned began receding. Far from wanting to carry the revolt against Muldoonism to new heights, most of the anti-tour protesters could not escape fast enough into normalcy.
By November 1982, the National Party’s grip on New Zealand had regained its full strength. A wage and price freeze had reduced the economy’s machinery to a slow grind. Unemployment was rising rapidly. And Labour’s new leader, David Lange, had yet to hit his stride as Opposition leader. The whole country seemed to have retreated into itself.
For thousands of young people the words of Blam Blam Blam’s "There is No Depression in New Zealand" had taken on the ring of prophecy.
It was this: New Zealanders’ wilful political denial; their sullen, self-defeating silence; that Neil Robert’s bomb was intended to shatter.
Today, nearly three decades later, both Neil Robert’s name and the final devastating act of his tragically short life have fallen victim to the collective historical amnesia that allows New Zealanders to repeat their political, economic and social mistakes over and over and over again.
Reviewing 2010, I cannot escape a feeling of déjà vu. The route John Key has chosen may differ markedly from Rob Muldoon’s, but he has led New Zealand back to all the old familiar places.
We are gripped by the same collective urge to deny the evidence of our eyes and ears. As if the dismissal of the Canterbury Regional Council; the creation of Auckland’s "democracy-proof" CCOs; the Canterbury Earthquake Reconstruction and Recovery Act; Simon Power’s and Kate Wilkinson’s relentless stripping away of our civil and workplace rights; and the extraordinary expansion of the State’s search and surveillance powers; are happening in some other country – to some other people.
There’s that same sullen refusal to be moved by the plight of our fellow citizens. Paula Bennett’s hand-picked razor-gang terrorises the sick, the disabled, and the solo mums. Judith Collins privatises the administration of misery. Nick Smith dismantles the world’s most successful no-fault accident compensation system. Sir Peter Jackson (to the frenzied cheers of the news media) pummels Actors Equity to a bloody pulp.
New Zealanders appear to have forgotten how to resist their government. That glorious anti-mining march aside, there’s the same "What’s the point?" fatalism that seized the country following the Springbok Tour and Muldoon’s subsequent, demoralising, success at the polls.
Neil Roberts never got to see what happened after his bomb went off. We are luckier. Looking back, it’s clear that New Zealand’s "silence closely resembling stupidity" was not maintained. In less that two years, change came – and on a scale young Neil could scarcely have imagined.

A Gift for Levitation: Asked to explain the difference between himself and the Prime Minister in an interview for North & South magazine, Bill English famously responded: "I’m a stayer, he’s a sprinter. I grind away, John just bounces from one cloud to another".
JOHN KEY’S greatest political gift is his levity. Which is not to say that the Prime Minister is inappropriately frivolous or comical – although he does have a politically endearing talent for self-deprecating humour. The word’s original meaning was "lightness", and it is in this sense that I am using it.
This quality of lightness has not gone unnoticed by Mr Key’s colleagues. His Deputy, Bill English, famously explained the difference between himself and his boss in an interview published in North & South magazine: "I’m a stayer, he’s a sprinter. I grind away, John just bounces from one cloud to another".
In many countries Mr Key’s light touch would not be regarded as an asset. When politicians become prime ministers or presidents in these much older societies they are expected to put on political weight, and to evince at all times a judicious seriousness. In short, they are expected to display gravitas not levitas.
New Zealanders are more than a little ambivalent on the subject of levitas versus gravitas. On the one hand, we do not expect our leaders to embarrass us on the world stage. On the other, we don’t like leaders who put on too many airs and graces or talk down to us.
Like so many other populations descended from pioneering stock, New Zealanders place a much higher value on practical achievement than they do on artistic talent or intellectual accomplishment. Artists and intellectuals tend to make most Kiwis nervous. As voters, we regard a surfeit of intelligence and/or creativity in our leaders as an implied reproach for our own (meagre?) abilities and tastes. In politics it is never wise to let the public think you think you’re better than they are.
Strangely, we don’t seem to mind if our leaders are richer than we are. Money, after all, is a wonderfully democratic thing. With sufficient hard work (and just a little bit of luck) just about anybody can become rich.
By contrast, great intellectual acuity and creative power are innate qualities. No amount of hard work can increase our native stock of intelligence and creativity (although it will certainly sharpen the skills we do possess). It’s an inconvenient truth which gives the lie to, and undermines, New Zealanders’ cherished egalitarian faith. That’s why so many Kiwis are suspicious of individuals with too much talent. It smacks of unfairness, privilege and elitism. Such people are not to be trusted.
Mr Key is certainly a very wealthy man, but that fact alone does not condemn him in the eyes of most New Zealanders. After all, he did not inherit his money – he made it, himself, by deploying the skills he was born with to their best effect. Indeed, the Prime Minister’s humble background; the fact that he and his sisters were raised in a state house by their widowed mother; only serves to reinforce his fellow citizen’s confidence in the universal attainability of the New Zealand dream.
A large pile of cash in the bank does, of course, possess the power to levitate just about anyone up, up and away from the daily drudgery of earning a living. For many people, however, the levity money confers can be personally devastating. It either breeds a sneering sense of superiority, or crippling feelings of guilt and/or obligation.
But, Mr Key’s public conduct reflects neither of these classic responses. His wealth does not appear to have had any malign effect upon him. Miraculously, he has risen above even this.
What it has done is allow him to deploy the otherwise quite ordinary aspects of his life and personality as a devastating political weapon.
The Prime Minister is not a connoisseur of fine art. He doesn’t attend the opera. He has penned no books, made no scientific breakthroughs, climbed no mountains, written no songs. He does not mix with artists or intellectuals, nor does he espouse with any noticeable fervour the grand, all-encompassing ideologies and religions of mankind.
He is, however, a husband and a dad with two teenage kids. He does like to watch the Rugby. He turns a mean steak on the family barbecue, and he drinks his beer straight from the bottle – just like hundreds of thousands of ordinary Kiwi blokes.
John Key’s political balloon is inflated not simply by the fortune he made as a currency trader, but by the paradoxical pressures of New Zealand’s thwarted egalitarianism. Ordinariness is his helium. We push him up to prove that we, too, can rise.
The Prime Minister is said to practice "the politics of aspiration". To aspire is to breath out, to reach up, to soar. John Key bounces from cloud to cloud on the warm updrafts of his nation’s confidence. On New Zealanders’ desperate conviction that politics can be, and should be, the province of ordinary men and women.
"And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn." - The Gospel of St. Luke. The painting is: The Arrival at Bethlehem (1897) by Luc-Olivier Merson.
"WHO WAS THAT?" Martha set down her laundry basket with a thud and cast a practised eye over her husband’s face. She’d always been able to tell when he was troubled, and forty years of marriage hadn’t made it any easier for him to hide his feelings.
"Oh, I don’t know, it just didn’t feel right sending them away. The girl was so very, very young, and so very, very pregnant. And the young fellow she’s travelling with – the baby’s father, I suppose – he wasn’t much older. Seemed like a steady sort of fellow though: a carpenter by trade. Both of them from some tiny place up north. They’re down here for the Census."
"That’s what I said. I told him he’d be lucky to find accommodation anywhere. Said he knew that already, that ours was the seventh place they’d tried. I tell you, Martha, the poor lad sounded desperate. And the girl seemed ready to have her baby at any moment."
"May the Good Lord forgive you, Joel Benjamin! How could you send that poor girl out into the night to give birth in some ditch under the stars, with no help near except a frightened boy. Have you forgotten what can happen to a woman in those circumstances? What can happen to her baby!"
The old man takes his wife in his arms, presses her head against his shoulder, feels the gentle shudder of her sobs.
"Go after them, you fool! Fetch them back! In the name of the son you could not save, Joel Benjamin, fetch them back!"
The old man hurries toward the gate, pushing past his startled guests, calling the gatekeeper to him.
The inn-keeper steps out into the crowded street, turning his head to right and left, trying to locate the pair in the gathering darkness.
"I wasn’t lying to you about the rooms, you know. There’s not a spare bed to be had. But my wife would not hear of you being turned out into the winter chill – not with your good lady so close to her time."
"Come in my dear. This is no season to be giving birth alone. And there are skilled hands here tonight. Three Parthian priests, great healers it is said, arrived at sundown from Jerusalem. They were asking after a child.
"Dozens of children here, I told them. Take your pick! But they shook their long oiled beards at me and said it was a new-born child they were seeking. Well then, I said, I don’t like your chances, because there are no …."
"Mine is the child they seek", the young woman said softly, "and it is here your wise men will find him. The Magi left a prince in his palace to see a king born in your stable."

Guardian Angels: Julian Assange, like the prophets of the Old Testament, has called the powerful to account. It is to be hoped that he is afforded the same divine protection.
"HE’S NOT at all like him. How can you even think that?" Gabriel’s pinions flutter with indignation, casting off tiny splinters of golden light into the frigid evening air.
"Oh, I don’t know," replies Raphael, brushing Gabriel’s still glowing sparks from his robes. "If you cast your mind back, you’ll recall that He wasn’t everybody’s favourite activist either. In fact, didn’t just about everyone in high places call him a trouble-maker? A terrorist even?"
"Oh, come on, Gabriel. You know as well as I do that ‘prophet’ is just another name for troublemaker. How do you think the kings of Israel responded to being called to account by the likes of Isaiah and Amos? Do you think they liked having their misdeeds discussed openly in the marketplace? Do you think they appreciated those bearded vagabonds striding into their palaces, pointing their fingers, laying bare their sins? I don’t think so!"
"They were speaking for God, Raphael – that’s what makes the difference. They were His mouthpieces. Their mission was divine."
Gabriel spreads his wings, and with an upward beat brings himself to a position just above a pair of forbidding wrought-iron gates. Gathered in a noisy semicircle around the gateway are the outside-broadcast vehicles and satellite dishes of the world’s media. He counts at least a hundred journalists stamping their frozen feet in the snow-shrouded Suffolk countryside.
"As individuals? No, not really. But then they are mortals, Gabriel. Sinners, every one. Just like Isaiah. Just like Amos. Just like all the human bearers of God’s word. He fashioned them, Gabriel. Endowing them with the wit and skill to subdue the whole earth: root and branch; fish and fowl. This is how they speak to one another nowadays – twittering and tweeting. Voices in the air, Gabriel. Hasn’t God always spoken thus?"
"And the man they seek, Raphael? He’s no stranger to the sins of the flesh. Does it seem likely that God would place his word in so flawed a vessel?"
"But isn’t that the point!" With a mighty beat of his wings he propels himself several thousand feet higher into the darkening sky. "Look about you! Look at what they have done to the garden we made for them to dwell in! They are fallen, Gabriel! Fallen! They should be left to freeze – or to burn. And yet here we are – just as we were that night on the hillside above Bethlehem, when we spoke to the shepherds, and just for a moment let them see the splendour of our wings. Because he loves them Gabriel – he loves them. Flawed though they be. Sinners though they are. He would not have them fall."
"But where were the signs? The wonders? Where was the gold, the frankincense, the myrrh? Where were we thirty-nine years ago when this fellow came into the world? I have no memory of a maternity ward in Townsville."
"I don’t think it works like that any more, Gabriel. That first time, remember, they called him Emanuel – "God is with us". And I don’t think he ever left. He remains with them, don’t you see? To be born again in every generation. The same story, Gabriel, told over and over and over again. What was it that Paul said: ‘For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places’."
"That certainly sounds like our friends in Washington", chuckled Gabriel, as the two archangels descended slowly towards the English country house.
I think I understand you now, Raphael", Gabriel smiles, "We’re here to bear witness. From the first betrayal to the final crucifixion. To the whole tragic passion play which, for twenty centuries, these doomed mortals have prepared for anyone who dares bid them be free."
"But we’re not the only witnesses," Raphael replies, spreading his wings protectively around half the house. "For each time the drama is played out there are always more who grasp its meaning. Who hear, as if for the first time, the words we heard Him speak to Pontius Pilate all those centuries ago: "For this purpose I was born and for this purpose I have come into the world – to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."
The Biggest Company You've Never Heard Of: Serco plc sits at the centre of a vast international web of business operations, including prisons, immigration detention centres, nuclear facilities, services to the US National Security Agency, air traffic control systems, railways, hospitals and schools.
ADAM RICKWOOD was just 14 years old when he died. His "carers" at Hassockfield secure training centre in County Durham found him hanging in his cell. Adam’s suicide, in August 2004, remains the United Kingdom’s youngest-ever "death in custody" case.
The following year a judge ruled that, shortly before his death, Adam had been subjected to "unlawful force" by his so-called "carers".
The incident that led to Adam’s suicide began when he resisted being placed in solitary confinement. Employing one of the "pain compliance techniques" secretly recommended to Britain’s privatised secure training centres by the UK Ministry of Justice, Adam’s "carers" struck him violently on the side of his nose, causing it to bleed profusely.
Having administered their state-sanctioned "nose distraction technique", Adam’s "carers" then confined their sobbing, blood-covered "client" to his cell, where he lay, without medical treatment, for several hours. Alone, in pain, fearing further assaults and convinced that he would never again be free, the traumatised teenager took his own life.
The private-sector organisation contracted by the British Government to run the Hassockfield secure training centre is called Serco plc.
Earlier this week, our own Minister of Corrections, Judith Collins, announced that this vast transnational conglomerate, memorably described by Guardian journalist Jane Martinson as "the biggest company you’ve never hear of"; the same company in whose "care" 14 year-old Adam Rickwood was driven to suicide; would soon be running the Mt Eden/Auckland Central Remand Prison.
In a press-release announcing the contract, Ms Collins explained: "Serco has a strong track record in managing prisons. I’m confident that the company will bring the high standards of professionalism, safety, rehabilitation and security expected by the Government to Mt Eden/ACRP."
One wonders exactly how Ms Collins and her Department of Corrections define "high standards of professionalism" when the fatal brutalisation of a 14 year-old boy – but one of many cases of prisoner and detainee ill-treatment uncovered at Serco-run facilities in both the UK and Australia – is part of the corporation’s "strong track record in managing prisons".
One certainly hopes that the ex-police, ex-military, security guards employed by Serco to keep order in the "Aussie Archipelago" of Immigration Detention Centres (security guards who bear more than a passing resemblance to the Blackwater Corporation’s notorious "contractors" in US-occupied Iraq) are not what Minister Collins has in mind when she talks about Serco bringing in "new ideas and international best practice".
Serco will certainly bring a wealth of experience in the business of privatisation. Three-quarters of the 50,000 people employed by Serco across the planet are former civil-servants. Not that there’s anything like a one-to-one correlation between the state-sector employees Serco replaces and the people who end up on its permanent payroll.
As Bevan Hanlon from the Correction Officers’ union noted in his response to Ms Collins’ announcement., Serco take-overs usually result in about 30 percent of the workers formerly employed by the State failing to secure re-employment in the new, privately-run entity.
This is hardly surprising, since Serco’s ability to turn a profit on the "business" of incarceration is almost wholly dependent upon its ability to provide the State with an equivalent level of "service" with fewer resources and far fewer staff.
It’s a Devil’s bargain. Ms Collins must know that Serco’s loss-leading tender can only be recouped at the expense of the prisoners in its "care". When fewer corrections staff are available to perform their highly demanding and often dangerous duties, the international literature all points to inmates spending more time in dangerously overcrowded and unsanitary cells, receiving reduced rations of inferior quality, having fewer exercise and rehabilitative opportunities, and being afforded considerably less dignity than when they were the responsibility of the State.
And, of course, these cut-backs come at a price. For individuals suffering from mental illnesses and/or drug and alcohol problems – prisoners without the intellectual or physical resources to withstand the constantly degraded living conditions – the stress will quickly become unbearable. Violence – against staff, other prisoners and, most tragically, against themselves – will increase.
In recommending Serco to her cabinet colleagues, Ms Collins has – wittingly or unwittingly – injected a deadly toxin into our correctional facilities. The outcome is horribly predictable: "deaths in custody" will rise dramatically.

A Great New Zealander: Tom Newnham, founder of the Citizens Association for Racial Equality (CARE), author of By Batons & Barbed Wire: A Response to the 1981 Springbok Tour of New Zealand, and a ceaseless fighter for the rights of oppressed people everywhere, died on Wednesday, 15 December 2010, aged 84.
The Squeezed Middle: Employing the political tactics perfected by the American strategists Mark Penn and Dick Morris, Phil Goff is attempting to play both sides against "the squeezed middle" - a phrase which, along with "Soccer Moms" and "Reagan Democrats" has more to do with polling than principle.
MARK PENN and Dick Morris have a lot to answer for. Between them they have managed to change the practice of politics in the modern world fundamentally. If you’ve ever wondered why today’s politicians never seem to do anything large or inspiring; or why modern politics appears to revolve around the petty and the paltry; then look no further than Penn & Morris.
It was Mark Penn who invented "Soccer Moms". This wonderfully evocative term was his shorthand way of describing middle-income mothers of young families more-or-less uninterested in political and economic issues – but absolutely committed to the moral and physical welfare of their families. The way to come at these voters, Mr Penn told his client, President Bill Clinton, was not via their back pockets, but through their values. Convince them that you care about the same things they care about, and they are much more likely to vote for you.
This is where Dick Morris enters the picture. His main claim to fame is as the inventor of the political technique known as "triangulation". His advice to President Clinton, as he contemplated his campaign for a second term, was brutally simple. Abandon fixed ideological positions and re-fashion your political message so that it incorporates elements of both the Left and the Right. In other words, if the liberal and conservative ideologies represent the base, your new position should be "above and between them" at the apex of a new "triangular" political configuration.
President Clinton’s ringing declaration that "the era of big government is over" and his support for Republican Party-inspired "welfare reforms" are two of the best known examples of "Clintonian Triangulation".
Political observers in the United States point to President Barack Obama’s latest White House-brokered compromise over bitterly contested tax and benefit legislation as evidence that he has embraced his Democratic Party predecessor’s "triangulation" technique. That President Obama recently played host to President Clinton at the White House has done little to dampen this speculation.
The Penn-Morris combination: intensive and continuous "neuro-personality" polling of the electorate; combined with the constant re-positioning of political parties – to keep them "above and between" the extremes of Left and Right. In the 21st Century, this is simply the way politics is done.
The National Party polls the electorate continuously, accurately tracking the smallest shifts in public opinion and building up "psychographic" profiles of the many (and often quite contradictory) components of the Government’s electoral base. Mr Key follows the results of his party’s polling assiduously – borrowing freely from the policies of both his right- and left-wing competitors to preserve the public’s perception of him as a leader refreshingly unencumbered by ideological baggage.
Labour’s leader, Phil Goff, attempted a little triangulation of his own last Monday with a speech to a gathering of well-heeled Auckland lawyers and businessmen entitled "The Squeezed Middle".
Promising a future Labour Government would "operate within tight fiscal restraints"(a clearly conservative commitment) he also pledged his party to growing "better jobs and higher incomes" (a traditional left-wing objective).
The subject of his speech – "The Squeezed Middle" – is clearly born of the same mixture of demographic and psychographic profiling that gave birth to Clinton’s "Soccer Moms" in the 1990s, and to "Reagan Democrats" back in the 1980s.
The picture it conjures up is one of deep social anxiety and economic insecurity. At its heart is the sort of middle-income family which did well in the boom years, but which now finds itself just a paycheque away from disaster. These are the folk who borrowed heavily – maybe to buy a better house or to set up a small business – and who now find themselves shivering in the bitter recessionary winds.
The "squeeze" they feel comes, on one side, from their fear of falling back into the poverty from which their family only recently escaped, and, on the other, from the pressure of a pitiless economic system that will crush their hopes without the slightest hesitation.
Mr Goff must know that such people are deeply conflicted. Strong believers in free enterprise, their values cast the poor as lazy "bludgers" – undeserving of the vast quantities of taxpayers’ money spent annually on their relief. But, they also know that if the worst happens, and they lose everything, it will not be for lack of hard work. Why doesn’t that count? They ask themselves. Why, when the chips are down, is the banker never your friend?
That’s the weakness of Penn-Morris politics. Power isn’t something that can be triangulated, and polling merely describes the voters’ predicament. Real politics is about making choices.
New Zealand’s problems need solutions: whether they be left-wing or right-wing solutions matters much less than locating a politician with the guts to give them a try.
Ruler by Divine Right?: The Maori King, Tuheitia, has unilaterally dismissed the Chair of the Tainui Parliament, Tania Martin. The King's advisors argue that Tuheitia's status as paramount chief of his people over-rides the democratic elements of the Iwi's constitution. The English King, Charles I, asserted something similar in 1641 and sparked a civil war.
Over-riding the tribe’s constitution, the Maori King, and Paramount Chief of the Tainui Iwi, Tuheitia, has dismissed Tania Martin, the democratically elected Chairwoman of Te Kauhanganui – the Tainui parliament. Her offence? Issuing a report sharply critical of the way the King and Te Arataura – his advisory board – have been managing the tribe’s resources. Her report has been interpreted as a direct thrust against the King’s mana – his authority and prestige. The equivalent in European law is lèse majesté – "injured majesty".
The first is whether or not the Tainui people, acting through their marae representatives, will challenge the King’s actions.
The second is whether or not the King and his advisors will allow themselves to be over-ruled by their own people.
And the third is whether or not the political leaders of Pakeha New Zealand will have anything to say about the political drama unfolding in the Waikato.
They should. Because Tainui’s drama is practically identical to the drama our own ancestors lived through more than 300 years ago. The rights and privileges which Members of Parliament still enjoy, and which we, as free citizens, hold dear, are all directly traceable to the bloody drama known as the English Civil War.
King Charles I found it intolerable that he was fiscally accountable to his own people through their Parliament. Believing that his political authority came directly from God, he refused to accept that his powers could be circumscribed in any way by the will of his subjects. When Parliament refused his demands for money, and declared his closest advisors traitors, the King, with 400 soldiers, tried to arrest the five politicians responsible. Forewarned, the parliamentary leaders escaped. London erupted in fury. Charles and his family fled, first to Oxford, then to Nottingham, where, on August 22nd 1642, he "raised his standard" – effectively declaring war upon his own subjects.
To date, King Tuheitia’s coup has been considerably more successful than King Charles’s. His dismissal and replacement of Te Kauhanganui Chairwoman, Ms Martin, is a fait accompli. It’s as if Charles had succeeded in arresting those five members of the House of Commons – leaving their stunned colleagues to debate their next move under the watchful eyes of the King’s musketeers.
That’s where the Tainui parliamentarians are now. They must either convene Te Kauhanganui in defiance of the King and reconfirm Ms Martin in the Chair, or accept that Tuheitia and Te Arataura have successfully asserted their right to manage Tainui’s affairs independently of, and without reference to either the local marae – or Te Kauhanganui.
What will Te Arataura’s next move be if Te Kauhanganui defies the King’s fait accompli and reinstates its discarded Chairwoman? If past practice is any guide, the Advisory Board will ask for a court injunction to enforce its executive authority.
Right there is where Tainui’s drama starts spilling out of the realm of Tuheitia and into the realm of Elizabeth II. So, right now, the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Attorney General, and every other New Zealand MP, need to start thinking about what their next move will be if the worst happens, and a Pakeha judge, by sanctioning the subversion of Tainui democracy, shreds Article Three of the Treaty of Waitangi.
If our political leaders do not step in and prevent Tuheitia from succeeding where Charles I failed, then more than the whanau and hapu of Tainui have reason to feel afraid. Because, at that moment, all of us – Maori and Pakeha alike – will know that John Key’s deal with the Maori Party, has solidified into a dangerously intimate and profoundly undemocratic alliance between the executive arm of the Pakeha state, and a small, legally protected clique of aristocratic Maori politicians and businessmen.
The very same combination of unaccountable political and economic power which our ancestors, for nine bloody years, fought a vicious civil war to break up and bring under their control.

Reluctant Witness: In every thriller there's always someone who doesn't want the detective to see what lies just beyond his line of sight. Why is Pike River Coal sending its lawyers to sit in on the Department of Labour's interviews with its employees?
IN JUST ABOUT every movie thriller there’s a blocking scene. Some thing or some body which gets in the way of the hero’s investigation.
At the door to the key witness’s apartment, the detective’s confronted by someone who very obviously doesn’t want to let him in. When he gives the witness’s name, the doorkeeper shakes his head:
But the detective (and, of course, the audience) can tell he’s prevaricating. There’s something "off" about the guy’s entire behaviour. His gaze keeps shifting to something standing just out of the detective’s line of sight. When the hero attempts to get a better view of the apartment, the doorkeeper becomes even more agitated:
And, if they don’t, then I’ve got to ask its top guys another question: Why is the Company insisting that its lawyers sit in on the interviews Department of Labour officials are conducting with mine workers?
The Company says it’s only concerned about safeguarding its employees’ – the mine workers’ – rights. But, if that’s the case, then wouldn’t they be talking to their union representatives? After all, that’s what the union’s there for – to protect the rights of its members.
And, in the case of Pike River Coal, that protection is provided by one of the country’s largest and best resourced trade unions – the Engineering, Printing and Manufacturing Union (EPMU) led by Andrew Little.
If Pike River Coal was only interested in making sure that the rights of its employees were being safeguarded, then wouldn’t the presence of the EPMU have reassured them that all was well?
So, why didn’t the involvement of the EPMU reassure Pike River Coal at all? What made it so touchy? Why, when Mr Little and his officials questioned the propriety of the Company’s lawyers being present at what are, in essence, evidence-gathering interviews by the Department of Labour, did everything become so heated?
When the prime suspect is being questioned by the Police it’s quite usual for him to have his lawyer present. Legal representation ensures that the suspect is not pressured into saying something that may later be used against him in court, should the matter ever come to trial. Suspects (especially in American thrillers) enjoy full constitutional protection against self-incrimination.
But have you ever seen a thriller where the suspect’s lawyer sits in on witness interviews? Just imagine how intimidating that would be. The detectives are asking an eye-witness to a shooting if he can identify the gunman – and the prime suspect’s lawyer is sitting there taking notes! How much co-operation do you think the Police’s key witnesses are going to provide under those conditions?
Pike River Coal is also, unbelievably, demanding that the Department of Labour inquiry team hand over any audio or video recordings they have already made, or make in the future, of evidence-gathering interviews with Company employees and/or sub-contractors.
I fervently hope that the Department’s officials to do not comply with Pike River Coal’s demand. Like the Company’s insistence that its lawyers be present during the gathering of evidence, it runs the risk of sowing very worrying seeds of doubt in the public’s mind as to whether the Department of Labour’s statutory inquiry into the Pike River mining disaster is being undertaken "without fear or favour".
Charging in with lawyers like this isn’t the only aspect of Pike River Coal’s behaviour which has struck a number of observers as being a little "off".
What, for example, lay behind its decision to hold on to the CCTV record of the original explosion for so long? Was no one monitoring the live feed from the mine’s mouth? Had someone been physically present outside the mine’s entrance to see and feel the blast, how long would it have taken to raise the alarm and activate the rescue procedures?
And why, if Pike River Coal is genuine about putting the interests of its employees first, did the Company not insist that union representatives be seated among the dignitaries at last week’s memorial service? The West Coast has long been a bastion of trade unionism in New Zealand. Am I the only one who found it strange that the 29 miners’ union and the CTU weren’t allowed to speak at their funeral?
Is there something – just out of their line of sight – that someone is desperate the detectives don’t see?
Second Time Farce: The unlucky generation born between 1929-39 had Roosevelt and Churchill, Hitler and Stalin, heroes and villains to match the epic scale of world-wide depression and war. The unluckier generation born between 1968-78 had to make do with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.
NEW ZEALANDERS born in the decade between the Wall Street Crash and the outbreak of World War II were dealt a truly unlucky hand. Their formative years were lived in the shadow of the Great Depression. War scarred their teens. And whatever hopefulness and idealism they carried into early adulthood was snuffed out by McCarthyism and the onset of the Cold War. Even the rising affluence the 1950s and early 1960s proved conditional. Yes, their new-found prosperity could be celebrated and enjoyed – but only soberly and responsibly, in ways that didn’t rock the boat.
I’m pretty sure the tightly constrained circumstances of this unlucky generation explains the baffled rage they visited upon their gloriously unconstrained off-spring. The cultural revolution of the late-1960s and 70s not only exploded the tight cocoon in which New Zealand was wrapped, but also revealed how very flimsy it was. Like the citizens of the Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz, when Kiwis peered behind the curtain of post-war conformity, they discovered they’d been living in awe of some very little men with very loud voices.
No sooner had the conservative post-war cocoon been destroyed than its makers began spinning another. This new restraint would be much more sophisticated than its predecessor. Within the second cocoon there would be more room to move, but it would be constructed of material far stronger than the first. This time there would be no breaking of the ties that bind.
Because, if 1929 was one of History’s sign-post years, then so was 1968. New Zealanders born in the ten year period between the high-tide of the 60s youth rebellion, and the final years of post-war affluence became a second unlucky generation.
The formative years of New Zealanders born in 1968 were years of unprecedented prosperity. But, by the time they entered primary school the country was already reeling from Britain’s entry into the EEC and the first oil shock. Dominating their childhood were the divisive politics of Sir Robert Muldoon. Their teenage years opened with the 1981 Springbok Tour and closed with the 1987 Stockmarket Crash. Most could not remember a time when the New Zealand economy was not in crisis. Their early adult years were disfigured by the economic "fixes" of Rogernomics, Ruthanasia and Jennycide.
This second unlucky generation could not even console themselves with the thought that they were living through an era of existential danger. The Neoliberal Counter-Revolution which got underway as these unfortunate kids were entering secondary school in the early 1980s was a distinctly tawdry affair. Where the first unlucky generation had Roosevelt and Churchill, Stalin and Hitler – heroes and villains to match the epic scale of world-wide depression and war – the second had to make do with Margaret Thatcher, and Ronald Reagan.
They were the prisoners of a fetishised economics: cocooned not in the morals of a long departed Victorian Age, or the paranoid fantasies of anti-communist America, but in a notion much more dangerous and difficult to overcome: that the world we inhabit is as good as it gets; that there are no longer any viable economic or political alternatives to the free market and the self-commodification it requires.
It is difficult to overstate the importance of this difference between the two unlucky generations. In the 1930s and 40s politics dominated economics absolutely, so the priority was clearly to prevent the twenty-somethings of the 1950s from considering either of the contemporary alternatives to capitalism – social-democracy or communism. It’s why the post-war social order had to be couched in terms of the citizen embracing a strict social and political conformity in return for affluent security.
For the "Rogernomics Generation" no such Faustian bargain’s been on offer. By successfully subordinating politics to economics, Neoliberalism has deprived them of the only possible means of escaping their cocoon.
This generation’s curious passivity has opened a yawning gap between the rapidly ageing rebels of the 60s and 70s and the generation of young New Zealanders only now entering their 20s. Not even the threat of global warming or the biggest financial disaster since 1929 have been able to shake the Rogernomics Generation's conviction that all intervention is futile.
But, if the dangerous fatalism of this zombie generation isn’t overcome, then very soon the luck will run out for all of us.

Gearing Down: To preserve the machinery of capitalism sacrifices will be made - but not by those who own it.
"A MENACING and Punitive Environment". As I watched the YouTube clip of mounted policemen charging student protesters in the streets of London, I couldn’t help thinking how accurately these words describe our present predicament.
From Athens to Dublin; from Lisbon to London; from Washington to Wellington; everywhere; you can hear the sound of political gears shifting down. For the first time in eighty years, the largest, slowest cogs of the state apparatus, its prime drivers, are being engaged.
At this, their most basic level, the relentless and implacable processes of government have only one purpose: keep the state machinery functioning. By any means necessary and without reckoning the human cost, keep the wheels turning. Under no circumstances should the machine be permitted to stop.
Those at the bottom of our society feel the downward shift first. "In all our public meetings, and in many of the written submissions," writes the Alternative Welfare Working Group, "there was a consistent message that Work & Income as an institution has become more intimidating."
The policy has yet be openly acknowledged, but it is already in effect: Get as many people as possible off the Invalids and onto the Sickness Benefit. Get them "work ready". Get them off the books.
What does that mean in practice? One of the beneficiaries who made a submission to the Alternative Welfare Working Group explains: "I have to explain my medical conditions to a different case manager every three months, who is a complete stranger. It is totally humiliating."
Last Saturday evening, the former leader of the National Party, Dr Don Brash, returned to the popular seaside resort of Orewa, north of Auckland, to deliver a speech. (Orewa was, of course, the scene of Dr Brash’s extraordinary "Nationhood" speech – the message which caused National’s poll-rating to surge an unprecedented 17 points in January 2004.)
On this occasion, however, it wasn’t Maori "privilege" in Dr Brash’s gunsights. This time his target was the National Party’s present leader and Prime Minister, John Key. The lanky economist’s natural civility precluded a direct assault upon his former colleague, but no one in the Orewa Branch of the National Party could’ve been in any doubt as to whom the following sentences were addressed:
"New Zealand is a great country, and we in the National Party are proud and passionate New Zealanders. But our great country is perhaps more at risk today than at any time since the Second World War. I believe it’s safe to say that our relative decline – both in terms of our economy and in terms of racial harmony – will never be reversed if our political leaders allow themselves to be driven entirely by political polls."
As the former Governor of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, Dr Brash is, naturally, familiar with this country’s precarious financial situation. He knows, too, that the global capitalist system will require a whole generation – maybe two – to absorb the economic, social and political consequences of the catastrophic financial collapse of 2008.
New Zealand’s experience of the Global Financial Crisis has, so far, been considerably less harrowing than that of Iceland, Greece or Ireland. But, as any economic historian will tell you, this country was also slow to feel the full effects of the Great Depression. Dr Brash must know that, in spite of one or two encouraging swallows, the summer of economic recovery is still a very long way off.
Indeed, it is probable that the winter of New Zealand’s fiscal discontent is only just beginning. When it finally takes hold, the political downshift will begin in earnest.
Stripped of their flummery, societies like ours stand revealed as the private property of a tiny elite. To protect that property, and to preserve their access to the capital that makes it a going concern, they will not hesitate to make the lives of the rest of us considerably poorer and more precarious. That’s what has happened in the United States, That’s what is happening in the United Kingdom. And that is what Dr Brash is not-so-subtly telling Mr Key must soon happen here.
A capitalist society in low gear is never a happy place. Governments struggle to retain office and individual politicians become extremely unpopular – as the Irish Prime Minister, Brian Cowen, has discovered. It is precisely at such critical historical junctures, however, that the ability to make unpopular (meaning undemocratic) decisions becomes all-important. Indeed, it is probably the most important duty in a Prime Minister’s job description.
With Dr Brash playing the role of Mr Key’s Work & Income case manager, the Prime Minister may soon discover that he has more in common with invalid and sickness beneficiaries than he could possibly have imagined.
The Utopian Viewpoint: The dream of building a new and much improved society is as old as Plato. The perennial problem with such utopian schemes, however, is that what promises to be a collective dream all-too-easily translates into an individual nightmare. New Harmony by F. Bate 1838 (This carefully planned industrial community was proposed by the utopian British Capitalist, Robert Owen.)
"ANOTHER AOTEAROA Is Possible" – that’s the hopeful title of a conference getting underway in Mangere tomorrow morning. This grand political hui – featuring some of New Zealand’s leading leftists – was conceived with not one, but two agendas. Or, to employ the steely jargon of yesterday’s revolutionaries: a Maximum Programme and a Minimum Programme.
For the Maximum Programme to prevail, the radical Unite Union leader, Matt McCarten, had to attract 5 to 10 percent support in last Saturday’s Mana by-election. If he’d ended the evening with 1,200 to 1,500 votes, Te Wananga O Aotearoa’s Mangere campus – the conference venue – would almost certainly have witnessed the birth of a "New Left Party".
Unfortunately for the Conference organisers, Mr McCarten ended up attracting the support of just 3.6 percent of Mana voters. This failure to surpass even the 5 percent MMP threshold means that tomorrow’s conference agenda will default to its Minimum Programme: "a day of dialogue with activists against injustice and inequality".
Apparently, "Another Aotearoa" is not possible – at least, not this weekend. Rather than the perennial struggle against injustice and inequality, surely this is the problem everyone attending tomorrow’s conference should come to grips with:
The British historian, Simon Schama, argues that revolutions are born of two volatile and often conflicting emotional states: Hope and Desperation. What, then, are New Zealanders’ hopes? And how desperate are they to fulfil them? That’s what the "New Leftists" attending tomorrow’s conference have to determine.
There can be little dispute that many of the people living in electorates like Mana are becoming increasingly desperate. Recently released statistics detailing the declining real incomes of Maori and Pasifika families make that shamefully clear. But, to give their desperation a radical political edge, someone or something must inspire them with hope.
If the low turnout of 55 percent is any guide, hope’s in pretty short supply among Mana’s desperate poor. With so many of the Left’s natural constituency unwilling to even participate in the by-election, the best Labour’s Kris Fa’afoi and Unite’s Matt McCarten seemed capable of inspiring was either an apathetic shrug of the shoulders or a grudging trip to the polling booth.
This lack of enthusiasm on the part of the poor was in sharp contrast to the mood of the actually wealthy or "aspirational" supporters of National’s Hekia Parata. Their generally hopeful disposition brought the Right’s feisty Maori diva perilously close to relieving Labour of it’s ninth safest seat.
The genius of Capitalism lies in the way it combines the promise of personal transformation with "equal" access to the cultural, legal and financial mechanisms required to bring it about. Of course, not everyone possesses the knowledge, the confidence, or the skill to make these mechanisms work for them. But most people do not attribute these deficiencies to weaknesses in the capitalist system – they attribute them to weaknesses in themselves.
Social-democracy’s appeal lay in its determination to make the capitalist’s promise of equal access to the mechanism’s of personal transformation real. Public health, public education, gainful employment: make these things universally available and the social barriers to individual achievement will disappear.
Presumably, the new Aotearoa will be a place from which injustice and inequality have been banished – an unquestionably desirable Minimum Programme. But this new, this "other" Aotearoa must offer the individual something more than just social security. Our brave new world needs a Maximum Programme.
Because, if the urge to enlarge the scope of individual achievement; "to strive, to seek, to find and not to yield" until one has tested the boundaries of human experience, "become all that you can be", is also banished from the New Left Party’s utopia, then I fear it will never clear even the lowest threshold of public acceptance.

Loud and Clear: The Mana By-Election result not only shows the importance of getting people to vote, but of giving them something to vote for.
Today, the "green" political brand is so potent that no major party can afford to issue a manifesto without at least paying lip-service to its core principle of "sustainability".
It was not always so. In the early 1970s New Zealand was still the sort of country where drowning lakes and rivers in the name of cheaper power was considered good politics by both the Right and the Left.
That was before the "Save Manapouri Campaign" – a mass political movement which for the first time successfully challenged, on a national scale, the view of "progress" which attributed no intrinsic value to New Zealand’s wild and beautiful places.
The second pebble was the Values Party. Launched just a few months out from the 1972 General Election by a young journalist named Tony Brunt, Values was the world’s first "green" political movement to wage a nationwide electoral campaign.
Though Labour ran away with the 1972 election, the Values Party exerted an extraordinary influence on the campaign. Its superb advertising (produced virtually free-of-charge by a couple of sympathetic cinematographers at the National Film Unit) gave focus to the widespread longing, especially among the young, for a political vision that encompassed something more than the endless accumulation of material wealth. Though it only secured a minuscule 2 percent of the popular vote, the Values Party opened a door for Labour: a door upon which was written: "Another world is possible".
Much of this has been forgotten. The landslide upon which most political historians focus their attention is the landslide that swept Robert Muldoon’s National Party to victory in 1975. Viewed from the perspective of 35 years, however, it is clear that the dramatic shift in people’s perceptions of the environment – the shift represented by Values' best-selling manifesto, Beyond Tomorrow – has proved to be the more enduring.
Analysing last weekend’s Mana by-election results, I’m wondering if we may be witnessing another seminal political moment. Like the 1972 General Election, it’s possible that the closely fought Mana contest holds some crucially important lessons for the major parties.
At the most superficial level, the result was a clear moral triumph for the Government and its very effective candidate, Hekia Parata. In a country only slowly emerging from recession; in an Opposition-held electorate perfectly positioned to send the Government "a message"; it almost beggars belief that the by-election campaign ended with a 14 percent swing towards the governing party.
Indeed, without radical left-wing trade unionist, Matt McCarten’s, last minute entry to the by-election race it's possible Ms Parata could've won the seat.
Mr McCarten saw the Mana by-election as an opportunity to send his own message. Not to the National Government of John Key, but to Phil Goff’s Labour Party.
Like the Values Party in 1972, he was determined to make Labour understand that "another world is possible". A world in which it is possible to campaign (and, ultimately, to govern) "as if you were free".
His challenge to Labour was to give on-the-ground, practical expression to the progressive policy initiatives announced at its Annual Conference by campaigning – as he did – on the issues of low wages, inadequate housing and the urgent need for job creation.
Labour’s candidate, the woefully inexperienced TV journalist, Kris Fa’afoi, wasn’t equal to meeting this last-minute challenge, and Mr McCarten’s dramatic intervention prompted the by now thoroughly alarmed Labour hierarchy into pouring everything it had into the Mana campaign.
It was this massive intervention which ensured Mr Fa’afoi’s victory – albeit with a sharply reduced share of the popular vote.
To the cynical observer, Mr McCarten’s 3.6 percent share of the Mana vote may seem derisory. But then, so did the 2 percent share won by Values in 1972. Besides, there are moments in politics when, as Prime Minister Key told Ms Parata’s jubilant supporters on Saturday night: "losing is winning."
Hopefully Labour’s "got the message" Mr McCarten was sending it throughout the campaign. That, if it is to successfully counter Mr Key’s (obviously still effective) appeal to "aspirational" Kiwis, it has to maintain the sort of "on the street" presence for which Mr McCarten and his radical Unite union are justifiably famous, and which, ultimately, is all that rescued Mr Fa’afoi from catastrophic defeat.
But, even more important than getting Labour out on the street, Mr McCarten’s candidacy – like Values' campaign in 1972 – should remind Labour that getting people to vote is only half the battle: the other half is giving them something to vote for.
In 1972, that was the environment. In 2011 it should be for the two million hard-working New Zealanders whose greatest aspiration is simply to make ends meet.
George Orwell's Chilling Image: "If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face— forever." With his latest legislative assault on our civil liberties, the Minister of Justice, Simon Power, has not only pulled the boot onto his foot, he's lacing it up.
On Monday, 15 November 2010, the Justice Minister, Simon Power, secured Cabinet approval for the introduction of the Criminal Procedure (Reform and Modernisation) Bill – his 526-page "reform" of the way the State treats New Zealanders accused of a criminal offence.
If that last sentence jars a little in your ears, it’s because the State generally prefers to describe the citizen’s experience of criminal prosecution as "The Justice System".
But "Justice" is the outcome we all hope the process will deliver. The process itself is an altogether different phenomenon. And, as anyone who has ever been arrested and brought to trial will tell you, it is far from pleasant.
The first thing that strikes you upon being arrested is the extraordinary disparity, in both power and resources, between you, the citizen, and the State agencies into whose hands you have fallen.
And those "hands" are anything but metaphorical. Police officers really do lay hands on you. You’re tossed into a malodorous concrete cell, a steel door slams in your face, and you’re "held in custody" until such time as they, or a judge, decide to let you go.
No one who’s ever suffered this deprivation of personal liberty ever forgets it. To say it inspires something close to pure panic seriously understates the experience of being locked up. Some people simply cannot endure it – as the grim tally of holding-cell suicides attests.
When you, "the accused", enter a courtroom the first thing that strikes you is how many people there are NOT on your side.
There are the Police officers, of course, the ones responsible for your arrest and detention. There’s the Crown Prosecutor – surrounded by a team of thin-lipped lawyers and clerks. Assisting these formidable-looking personages is another team of austere court officials. And presiding over them all is the Judge – another lawyer who, prior to being "elevated to the bench" by a bunch of politicians, was probably also a Crown Prosecutor.
Strange as it may seem, the most important thing you’ve got on your side is history: the long history of ordinary people’s struggle against the overwhelming power of the State. Hundreds of years of subjects and citizens imposing upon the agencies of Crown and State a set of rules designed to protect all those unfortunate enough to fall into their hands.
Rules that make it possible, at least some of the time, for the outcome of these grotesquely unequal struggles between ordinary people and the State to be worthy of the name "justice".
Like the rule that the accused must be considered innocent until the State is able to prove him guilty. Or the rule that no accused person can be forced to incriminate, or testify against, himself. Or the rule that the State must disclose to the accused all the evidence which it claims to have against him. Or the rule which says that the accused must be permitted to confront his accusers. Or the rule that says he is entitled to professional legal counsel.
Or the most ancient and important rule of all: the rule which says the accused is entitled to be judged by a jury of his peers.
Because if anyone is on the accused’s side in a court of law it’s the twelve ordinary people sitting in the jury box. The twelve ordinary people the State is required to convince "beyond reasonable doubt" that the accused is guilty.
The twelve ordinary people which Simon Power, in the name of efficiency, is proposing to remove from the courtroom for all but the most serious crimes.
Mr Power is also proposing to dilute many of the hard-won protections against arbitrary state power described above.
Small wonder that Dunedin lawyer and Vice-President of the New Zealand Law Society, Anne Stevens, told the Otago Daily Times that the Criminal Procedure (Reform and Modernisation) Bill, introduced to Parliament on Monday, sets up the "efficient regime totalitarians dream about".
Biographical Note: During the 1981 Springbok Tour, Chris Trotter was arrested, charged, photographed, fingerprinted, held in a cell for six hours, released on bail, eventually brought to trial and triumphantly acquitted of the heinous crime of "Obstructing a Footpath".

The Smiling Assassin: Pete Hodgson's mastery of the dark arts of politics goes back a long way, but his latest scalp - Pansy Wong's - was taken in a 'sting' operation that came pretty close to perfection.
IN RETROSPECT, the year I spent editing the Otago student newspaper, Critic, probably did me no good. In terms of journalism, I started at the top and have been working my way down ever since. In terms of sheer fun and excitement, however, being the editor of Critic in the tumultuous year of 1981 was hard to beat.
As a sort of insurance policy against what I suspected would be a strong on-campus reaction to the mass protests planned for the Springboks Rugby tour in July-September 1981, I agreed to give a young, right-wing history tutor, Michael Laws, his own weekly column – "Dragonfly". Things were going to get ugly, and I wanted the students of Otago to know that their newspaper was open to all shades of political opinion.
After Critic I left varsity and got a job at the University Book Shop. Years passed. And while I was making my way up the ranks of the trade union movement in Dunedin, Michael was working in the National Party Research Unit in Parliament. His highly successful association with Winston Peters marked him out as "one to watch". Certainly, I had little doubt that he would enter Parliament within a very few years.
Another man on his way towards a parliamentary career in the 1980s was Pete Hodgson. When I first met Pete he was selling vegetables out of a barrow on the student union lawn, where "The Ancient & Royal Anti-Scurvy League" had become something of a fixture in the 1970s. In the 1980s, however, Pete had left the barrow behind and was rapidly winning himself a reputation for formidable political craftsmanship as the Labour Party’s Otago Regional Organiser. Following the Labour victory of 1984, Pete’s talents were re-directed towards protecting Labour’s marginal seats.
What this meant only became clear to me one day in the mid-80s when Pete sauntered into the University Book Shop and asked me if I still had copies of Michael Laws’ "Dragonfly" columns from 1981. A little alarm-bell started ringing somewhere far off in the back of my mind, but as a loyal Labour Party member, I dutifully photocopied a complete set of Michael’s 1981 columns and handed them over to Pete.
In the 1987 General Election Michael Laws ran as the National Party candidate against Labour’s Bill Sutton in the highly marginal electorate of Hawke’s Bay. He lost, but only narrowly. Just 859 votes separated to two leading candidates.
When I asked him about it, many years later, Michael told me it had been a dirty campaign. Labour, he said, had dug up all sorts of embarrassing material from his past.
Pete Hodgson’s talents as a plotter, schemer and highly skilled political manipulator have seldom been better displayed than in the downfall of the Minister of Women’s and Ethnic Affairs.
The first act of the drama was to accuse Ms Wong of improperly using her ministerial title to support a private business contract involving her husband, Sammy Wong. An indignant Ms Wong denied doing any such thing. She’d simply added her signature to a Deed of Variation and given her occupation – quite correctly – as "Minister of NZ Government" and her address as "Parliament Buildings, Wellington, NZ".
At first it appeared as if Pete Hodgson’s rocket had misfired. The Cabinet Office absolved Ms Wong of any impropriety, and her husband rallied to her defence by publicly admitting that, with hindsight, he was foolish to embroil his wife in a private business deal.
But Pete’s rocket hadn’t misfired. In releasing the information about the Minister’s signature on the Deed of Variation, he had merely put a match to his rocket’s blue touch-paper.
Perhaps Pete began the final act of the drama by quietly prompting one or two friendly Press Gallery journalists to start asking questions about exactly who paid for the flight to China back in April 2008 (when the Deed was signed).
Or, maybe he didn’t have to. Maybe the final act began with him waiting for the spousal international travel rules ‘penny’ to drop of its own accord. Either way, his rocket was always bound to score a direct hit.
The moment anyone – journalist, Prime Ministerial aide, fellow Cabinet Minister, anyone – asked Pansy Wong if her husband’s travel costs had been subsidised on their April ‘08 "holiday" to China, her political career was over.
All-in-all, it was pretty close to being the perfect ‘sting’ operation. Certainly, poor Pansy never saw it coming.
The "right time" is right now: Matt McCarten's campaign for the working-class parliamentary seat of Mana is a timely reminder that the fight for justice preceeds us, envelops us, and will go on long after us. And though, as Marx observed, working people are everywhere in chains, the most important revolutionary lesson is learning to act "as if you were free".
WHEN MATT McCARTEN told me he was thinking of putting his name forward for the Mana by-election, I shuddered inwardly.
I didn’t, of course. I just waited for Matt to make his case and, as always, he produced a host of compelling reasons for proceeding with his plan.
By choosing Kris Faafoi, a journalist with no discernible links to either the Labour Party or the wider progressive movement – until he became Phil Goff’s press secretary – Labour’s leadership have made it very clear that, as far as the Mana electorate is concerned, it’s going to be business as usual.
Even though, as Matt pointed out to me in the most forceful terms, "business as usual" in the streets of Porirua means poverty, unemployment, homelessness, crime and despair.
"With the Labour Party moving steadily to the Left," he intoned disapprovingly, "this is precisely the wrong time to challenge Goff’s hand-picked candidate in an important by-election in one of the party’s safest seats."
Then I caught the gleam in Matt’s eye, and I told my inner political analyst to go stick his objections where the sun don’t shine.
Because if being on the Left means waiting for the "right time" to fight for your principles, then, as the hero of Howard Spring’s wonderful political novel, Fame Is The Spur, discovered, when the fight comes to you, the bright sword of principle can no longer be drawn. Through all those years, while you were waiting for the "right time", the sword’s blade was rusting fast to the scabbard.
Matt McCarten has never been that sort of leftist. His sword never rests long enough in its scabbard to gather a speck of rust. And the trade union he built from scratch – Unite! – has never waited for the "right time" to do anything.
The way Matt set about organising the supposedly "unorganisable" workers of the service sector always reminded me of General Woundwort, the fearless rabbit leader in Watership Down. No matter how formidable the enemy, he always attacked. Watching Unite’s young, low-paid workers take on MacDonald’s, Sky City Casino, and Restaurant Brands, you could almost hear General Woundwort’s rallying cry rising-up from the picket lines: "Come on lads, dogs aren’t dangerous!"
And now Matt’s out there in the Spring sunshine, standing on the street-corners of Mana with his crew, talking to state house tenants about homelessness; to low-paid workers about a minimum wage of $15.00 per hour; to unemployed workers about creating jobs.
And there’s work to be done. Matt’s canvassers have already discovered several empty state houses, while just a few streets away a young family, crowded into a friend’s garage, waits for Housing New Zealand to find them somewhere to live. The empty properties are already being vandalised and the copper piping is long gone.
"What do we need?", asks Unite organiser, Joe Carolan: "We’ve got carpenters, we’ve got plumbers, we’ve got electricians. We can fix this place up. We’ve got people in need. A young family in need … Are you telling me that the only thing we need is to wait for a bureaucrat for another year or two years? We should move people in now."
That’s the way the Labour Party used to talk – back in the days when it still remembered how to fight.
I asked Matt if he’d heard of Slavoj Zizek – the Slovenian socialist currently setting a principled cat among the fat, pragmatic pigeons of the European Left.
"Well, Matt", I replied, "Zizek is challenging Europe’s social-democrats to stop looking over their shoulder at the European Central Bank; to govern ‘as if they were free’.
"Maybe that’s what you should ask the Mana electors, Matt. To stop looking over their shoulder at Labour.

Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937): Gramsci's revolutionary insights into the nature of political authority are dramatically illustrated in the "counter-hegemonic" decision of 220 primary and intermediate school boards of trustees to challenge the "common sense" of the National Government's untested and widely criticised regime of "national standards".
THE MAN was considered so dangerous the Prime Minister had him jailed for 20 years. His crime? Heinous. He’d come up with a new way of explaining things.
On one level, the answer’s straightforward: because if we don’t obey our governments we end up – as he did – in jail.
At a deeper level, however, the answer is much more complex than that. Yes, the state enjoys a monopoly on the legitimate use of physical force. But, if you think about it, an exclusive reliance on force is a very inefficient and ultimately self-defeating way to run a country – just ask the Burmese generals.
Our man’s great insight was that to secure popular obedience the state requires not only a monopoly on the use of force, but also a monopoly on what the overwhelming majority of the population regard as "common sense".
The man we’re talking about, Italian political theorist, Antonio Gramsci (1891-1937) described this state monopoly on common sense as "hegemonic".
This past week we have witnessed an open challenge to the New Zealand state’s hegemonic control. Two hundred and twenty primary and intermediate school Boards of Trustees (BoTs) have announced their intention to obstruct the Government’s policy of requiring all primary and intermediate schools to implement "national standards" in reading, writing and numeracy.
In what is fast becoming a classic Gramscian confrontation, the 220 BoTs (representing one tenth of the total) are contesting the common sense of the National Government’s policy.
In defence of their position they cite the research of leading educational scholars and point to the superiority of assessment mechanisms already in place. The real experience of teachers and pupils in school classrooms, they say, matches the data of empirical research in contradicting the claims of the Education Minister, Anne Tolley. According to the rebel BoTs, Ms Tolley’s claims are not rational but ideological.
But the Minister is not without ammunition of her own. To the mostly middle-class New Zealanders who support the National Party, requiring the nation’s primary and intermediate schools to focus on ensuring all children are proficient in the "Three Rs" is unquestionably a matter of common sense. To these folk, it is the BoTs and the teaching profession who are behaving "ideologically".
Gramsci would clap his hands in delight. Because the way in which the stand-off between the Government and its opponents is unfolding dramatically illustrates why the concept of "hegemony" embraces not only the struggle between state and citizen, but also the ideological struggle between antagonistic social classes over what exactly constitutes common sense.
The middle class, with its ready access to "cultural capital" (books, computers, overseas travel, family associations with the universities, professions and the arts) enjoys a strong advantage in education systems geared towards competition and ranking.
The working-class, with much less access to cultural capital, relies upon the public education system to make up the experiential deficit between itself and the middle-class. A focus on the process of learning, and on helping each student to master a steadily expanding range of skills, rather than a harshly competitive, pass/fail results-based pedagogy, is thus of much more benefit to working-class families.
That so many BoTs are willing to challenge the National Government’s education policies strongly suggests that it (and its middle-class allies) are losing the hegemonic struggle.
Perhaps the fierce, recession-driven competition for a dwindling number of high-paying jobs (and the social status that goes with them) and the not unrelated exodus of their children to Australia, is persuading more and more middle-class parents that the way New Zealand society is currently configured has very little to do with common sense.
Like Dr Don Brash and his colleagues on the 2025 Task-Force, Ms Tolley appears to be defending a version of common sense that has fewer and fewer adherents. This process of reality overtaking ideology, Gramsci dubbed "counter-hegemonic".
But the steady advance of counter-hegemonic thinking, Gramsci warned, could only end one way: in what he called a "crisis of authority".
Already in the dispute between Ms Tolley and the rebel BoTs we are hearing veiled references to the Ministry of Education’s extensive powers of to "discipline" those schools which refuse to come back into line.
Already, what Gramsci called the "mask of consent" is slipping, and beneath it the metallic gleam of the State’s monopoly on force is clearly visible.
And what happens when the citizens’ new definition of what constitutes common sense is resisted by the iron fist of the State?
Ah well, that is how Gramsci defined revolution. And that is why, at Gramsci’s 1926 trial, Mussolini’s fascist prosecutor told the Court:

Unless you are the grouchiest Grinch, your mailbox may be stuffed with cards, pictures and holiday letters over the next few weeks.
Call me old-fashioned but I still do the whole Christmas letter business. Starting in October, I carefully select cards – Christian cards for friends who share my faith and cards for those who celebrate the Festival of Lights or nothing at all. I choose stamps that reflect the card’s message, and then I write one of those horribly obnoxious Christmas letters — complete with well-selected pictures.
Perhaps you roll your eyes and toss my letter in the trash. I hope not. I come from a long line of women who liked notes, cards, and pictures in the mail. My grandmother LeNore Enz wrote something annually called the “Enz-o-Gram.”
In her 1967 version, she refers to the ten-year-old me as a “sweet and loving child who is a good reader and student.” She told about my singing in the children’s choir at the 450th anniversary celebration of the Protestant Reformation at the Fort Wayne Memorial Coliseum. I remember singing in the choir; I don’t remember being particularly sweet and loving.
My grandmother’s letter has that certain air of hyperbole of many holiday letters. While her letter is not particularly braggadocio, it’s also not entirely truthful and may slightly stretch the truth by not offering the full picture. Our family then, as our family now, is far from perfect.
For many years, I wrote something called “The Newburgher” (a nod to “Talk of the Town” in “The New Yorker.”) Long on words and short on pictures, I realized it was a snooze to everyone but me. Even my husband wouldn’t read it. I’ve considerably shortened the letter and added several pictures.
Like my grandmother, I am also guilty of the sin of omission. But who wants to read a holiday letter about the bad stuff? And everybody has the bad stuff.
For example, our 2013 letter highlights a once-in-a-lifetime trip that five family members took to Scotland and Ireland. We had a wonderful time and saw many interesting sites. With five aging bladders in our family, we also saw every bathroom, john, potty, outhouse, privy, loo, washroom and truck stop lounge in Scotland and Ireland.
For my money, I preferred the antiseptically clean bathrooms at the Giant’s Causeway Visitors Center in Ulster, Northern Ireland, to the tiny bathroom at Edinburgh Castle where you descended a fourteenth century stone stairwell.
I included a photograph of our son in this year’s letter. He completed an internship at the House of Representatives. It’s a nice picture of him standing in front of the door of the office. Did I have a better picture? Yes, there is a photo of him outside the White House attending a Congressional event. His dress shirt is buttoned at the top, he has on no tie, and one jet black hair clump stands straight up. He looks exactly like Alfalfa, if the Our Gang Little Rascal stood in front of the White House.
I did not include several wonderful photographs from our spring vacation to Las Vegas, because then I would have been unable to include photos from the Big Trip. Why? Because the reader would then note my weight gain. Vanity, thy name is Raven Lunatic.
Every year, I say this will be the last time I do this. When I add up the cost of cards, stamps, and the time involved, it’s too much. I swear, I’m finished. Stamps are reportedly going up again. I now have arthritis in both thumbs. My husband signed all of the cards this year, and I did not include personal notes.
Despite the truth-juggling, I still defend the holiday letter. I enjoy getting them, and people tell me they enjoy receiving ours. Okay, so I left a few things out. I’m sure all the letters I receive include the absolute truth and full gamut of family life throughout the year. I’m sure of it.

I subsequently located the comments of Rambam to which Rivash refers, although what Rambam actually means by his remarks is the subject of considerable controversy:
As you probably already know, getting your plumbing repaired can be expensive. If you would like to avoid this costly service in the future, it might be worthwhile to learn to solve plumbing problems yourself. Read on if you would like to become a plumbing expert and save money.
Avoid plumbing problems! Do not stop up the toilet! Some common items that will stop up a toilet include: toys, hair, paper towels, birth control items, and feminine personal products. Do not flush these items down your toilet - unless the instructions say otherwise! These can stop up your toilet - to the point that nothing else will work - except calling a plumber!
Don't be afraid to call a professional. Don't take on jobs to save money, if you aren't sure how to fix them. Calling a professional plumber saves you money, the experience and know-how can fix your problem sooner and with less fuss.
You do not give the plumber all the money until he is finished with his work. You may have to pay a portion of the cost before the plumber works on the job, but you should never have to pay in full until after everything has been correctly finished. It is good to know that the plumber did everything as promised before he gets his money.
Unclog drains with ease. Try using a plunger and drain cleaner, as your clog may simply be a build-up of hair and debris. If this doesn't work you may have to clear the drain with a snake. Feed the snake into the drain line as far as it will go. Turn the crank gently, which will help to loosen the clog. Remove the snake, and run water down the drain to see if the clog has been removed. You may have to use the snake a couple of times, before the clog is cleared so don't give up!
Find a better way to discard of cooking oil instead of pouring it down the drain where it can easily clog your pipes. Keep a coffee can or other metal container handy to pour grease into after cooking. Place the can in the freezer to harden the grease and when it's full, discard it with the trash.
In cold climate areas, sometimes the pipes in the plumbing system freeze. You can thaw them out without calling a plumber. Before beginning this process, open the faucet and begin thawing closest to the faucet and then move down the line as sections thaw out. One method you can use is to wrap the pipe with a heavy towel or burlap and then pour hot water over it, set a bucket underneath to catch the water.
Never hire a plumber that is not licensed, insured and bonded. If the plumbing company cannot provide you with reference numbers for their credentials, move on quickly. It is a common question and it should be a no-brainer for them to provide them to you. If they have issues with you asking, take that as a big red flag.
One way to avoid a common plumbing problem is to make sure never to flush anything but human waste and toilet paper down a toilet. Other things made of paper like tissues, paper towels, and the like do not dissolve the same way toilet paper does and can get stuck.
To compare the quality of your pipes or sewers over time, create a video for documentation purposes. Several months later, make the same video so that you can see if there are any new cracks or holes that require fixing. This can serve as a great way to analyze your infrastructure.
When using please click the up coming post , let the water run for a few minutes even after you shut off the disposal itself. The ground up waste matter generated by the disposal exits your house plumbing via water force and without that water, it can sit in pipes and cause clogs.
If you have been working outside for a long period of time, be sure to take a break to get out of the sun. You can easily forget that the sun's hot rays are shining down on you while you are working.
To prepare for the cold weather, properly drain all outside faucet bibs and turn off the water supply to those faucets. A piece of foam taped to the outside bib can provide excellent insulation to prevent any remaining water from freezing or splurge for a specialty cover that comes complete with velcro closures.
The most important plumbing tip you need to know is -- how to turn off your home's main water supply. Once the water is shut off, you can investigate problems and figure out how to resolve them. Walk the family through the house and show them where all the water shut-off valves are, and how to use them.
If your kitchen sink sprayer hose is hard to get out, it might be catching the valve underneath the sink. Protect the valve with an insulation foam pipe. Cut the foam pipe in half and place it over the valve. Tape it if you need to. You can repeat this operation on other valves too if they are exposed.
When you are working on any kind of plumbing project, you always need a backup person. This is because, when working with water, you never know when an emergency can happen and that second pair of hands can come in very useful! This can even be an unskilled person who can follow directions.
As have a peek at this website can see, maintaining and repairing your own plumbing isn't as difficult as it may appear at first glance. It just requires doing research, getting documents in order and asking a lot of questions. The work will pay off once you see how it can help save you money.
In this young adult novel, a mathematically inclined teenager who ignores the sad events she does not want to remember learns to deal with them by literally revisiting her past through wormholes.
There are some unusual and unique things about this book. I have never seen anything like the course Gottie H. Oppenheimer is taking from an especially creative and inspiring teacher. The quiz in that class asks high school students questions like "Describe the Gödel metric" and "What is a key characteristic of a Möbius strip?"
The mathematical ideas and mathematicians discussed in this book are unusual in fiction (or even non-fiction) aimed at this age group and that is something good in itself. Still, I do wish there were not so many inaccuracies. For instance, the Gödel metric is not a "solution to the E=MC2 equation" which proves that the past still exists. (It would have been more accurate to say that is a solution to the equations of general relativity which is interesting because time in the universe it describes is entirely cyclical.)
Also, I have some appreciation for the implication that Gottie will be famous for discovering an equation when she grows up. This could definitely be an inspiration for some children. However, the idea that this discovery suggests an important role for human emotions in physics, directly affecting the shape of spacetime, struck me as a bit melodramatic.
In conclusion, however, I realize that all of my concerns and complaints above would be irrelevant to the young adults who are this book's intended audience. Such a reader could learn some important ideas about math, physics and dealing with emotions from this unusual story, and would probably enjoy reading it as well.

The undergraduate student union at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, passed a motion on 22 February to support the Palestinian-led boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign. The vote passed with a 58 percent majority.
There is only one logical and civilized way to determine the owners of the land of Palestine and that is in the United Nations and its charters as agreed upon by 194 nations. Boycotts, divestments and sanctions may be the only route to compel Israel to understand that fact.

The Israeli government played a direct role in recent policy and legislative moves in the US, UK and other countries to suppress the free speech rights of citizens calling for the boycott of Israel over its human rights abuses. Israel is now planning to significantly step up its efforts to thwart the Palestine solidarity movement, through its embassies in key capitals.

The British government formally published Wednesday new guidance ostensibly intended to “stop inappropriate procurement boycotts by public authorities.” While the Conservatives have presented the document as a way of protecting Israel from the growing Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) campaign, activists say that the measures actually fall short of a ‘ban’ on boycotts.
There is a very coordinated and well-financed campaign led by Israel and its supporters literally to criminalize political activism against Israeli occupation, based on the particular fear that the worldwide campaign of Boycott, Sanctions, and Divestment, or BDS — modeled after the 1980s campaign that brought down the Israel-allied apartheid regime in South Africa — is succeeding.

The boycotting of goods produced on settlements in the West Bank by local councils and public bodies is to be outlawed, the government will announce this week.
The call for boycott is a response to the complicity of Israel’s cultural institutions in Israel’s crimes.

In the Belgian city of Liege, organizers of an annual dance festival turned down an Israeli sponsorship of the event last week after boycott threats. Israel had initiated and offered to sponsor the festival after the Batsheva Dance troupe was chosen as an opening act. But, “at a later stage,” a cable sent from the embassy in Belgium to the Israeli ministry reads, “they informed us that they did not want to be tied to the embassy, were forgoing our support and returning the money. All of this because of the threat of a boycott. Protests made to the festival organizers failed to yield any results.”

But they aren't the only major killers. In fact, they're not even the leading killers anymore! Today, cancer claims more lives globally than HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis combined, and the death toll from cancer is only going to grow.
Cancer is a major burden of disease worldwide. Each year, tens of millions of people are diagnosed with cancer around the world, and more than half of the patients eventually die from it. In many countries, cancer ranks the second most common cause of death following cardiovascular diseases.
Women with high-grade ovarian cancer live longer and respond better to platinum-based chemotherapy when their tumors have BRCA2 genetic mutations, researchers at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and the Institute for Systems Biology report in the Oct. 12 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
“BRCA2-mutated tumors are more vulnerable to these DNA-damaging agents, which is really exciting because there are a number of drugs in clinical trials now that block DNA repair that might prove effective against these tumors in combinations,” said senior author Wei Zhang, Ph.D., professor in MD Anderson’s Department of Pathology.
BRCA2 and its cousin, BRCA1, are tumor-suppressing genes involved in DNA repair that, when mutated, raise a woman’s risk for having breast or ovarian cancer.
“Uncovering the separate potential effects of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations takes us a step towards a more personalized approach to treating ovarian cancer, and perhaps other cancers,” Zhang said. “This paper suggests those two genes, and the many others involved in DNA repair, are prime targets for further research.”
Past studies of the possible clinical impact of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations tended to look at the two genes together and were limited by small sample sizes.
First author Da Yang, Ph.D., an Odyssey Fellow in MD Anderson’s Department of Pathology, said their in-depth study was made possible by The Cancer Genome Atlas project. TCGA published a study of 489 cases of high-grade serous ovarian cancer, the most common form of the disease, that combined an exhaustive analysis of each tumor’s genome with comprehensive clinical data on each patient.
“TCGA gave us enough analytical power to differentiate between BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and conduct a survival analysis,” Yang said.
Of 316 cases, 29 tumors had BRCA2 mutations tumors and 37 had BRCA1 mutations. Tumors were similar in grade and stage. Findings include:
* 61 percent of patients with BRCA2 mutations survived for five years, compared with 25 percent of those with normal BRCA2 in their tumors.
* 44 percent of those with BRCA2 mutations lived three years after surgery and platinum treatment without disease progression, compared with 16 percent of those with normal BRCA2.
* All of those with BRCA2 mutations responded to platinum chemotherapy, compared to 82 percent with the normal gene and 80 percent whose tumors had BRCA1 mutations.
* Their response to chemotherapy lasted 18 months, compared with 11.7 months for normal BRCA2 and 12.5 months for BRCA1 mutations.
* Tumors with BRCA2 variations also are hypermutants - they had more genetic mutations - with 84 mutations per tumor sample compared to 52 for normal BRCA2
Zhang said this last aspect - called the hypermutator phenotype - might be both a factor in the development and growth of the tumor and a sign of its vulnerability.
The ovaries are part of a woman’s reproductive system. They are in the pelvis. Each ovary is about the size of an almond.
The ovaries make the female hormones - estrogen and progesterone. They also release eggs. An egg travels from an ovary through a fallopian tube to the womb (uterus).
When a woman goes through her “change of life” (menopause), her ovaries stop releasing eggs and make far lower levels of hormones.
BRCA2 is normally involved in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks. Cells with BRCA2 mutants are less capable of repair, allowing other genetic mutations to survive and grow, the type of genomic instability that cancer thrives upon.
However, cancer cells in turn rely on DNA repair to defend themselves against DNA-damaging drugs, such as platinum-based agents. So adding drugs that inhibit DNA repair could increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy, Zhang noted. PARP-inhibitors, a new class of drug in clinical trials, block DNA repair and may also be effective in treating BRCA2 mutated ovarian cancer.
Doctors cannot always explain why one woman develops ovarian cancer and another does not. However, we do know that women with certain risk factors may be more likely than others to develop ovarian cancer. A risk factor is something that may increase the chance of developing a disease.
Family history of cancer: Women who have a mother, daughter, or sister with ovarian cancer have an increased risk of the disease. Also, women with a family history of cancer of the breast, uterus, colon, or rectum may also have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.
If several women in a family have ovarian or breast cancer, especially at a young age, this is considered a strong family history. If you have a strong family history of ovarian or breast cancer, you may wish to talk to a genetic counselor. The counselor may suggest genetic testing for you and the women in your family. Genetic tests can sometimes show the presence of specific gene changes that increase the risk of ovarian cancer.
Personal history of cancer: Women who have had cancer of the breast, uterus, colon, or rectum have a higher risk of ovarian cancer.
Menopausal hormone therapy: Some studies have suggested that women who take estrogen by itself (estrogen without progesterone) for 10 or more years may have an increased risk of ovarian cancer.
Scientists have also studied whether taking certain fertility drugs, using talcum powder, or being obese are risk factors. It is not clear whether these are risk factors, but if they are, they are not strong risk factors.
Having a risk factor does not mean that a woman will get ovarian cancer. Most women who have risk factors do not get ovarian cancer. On the other hand, women who do get the disease often have no known risk factors, except for growing older. Women who think they may be at risk of ovarian cancer should talk with their doctor.
Additional studies of the function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are needed to more fully understand and exploit their findings to treat cancer, Zhang and colleagues note.
The Cancer Genome Atlas is a joint project of the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both of the National Institutes of Health, to comprehensively characterize changes in genetic mutation and regulation of various cancers.
Co-authors with Zhang and Yang are Sofia Kahn, Ph.D., and Yan Sun, M.D., Ph.D., of MD Anderson’s Department of Pathology; Kenneth Hess, Ph.D., of MD Anderson’s Department of Biostatistics, Anil Sood, M.D., of MD Anderson Departments of Cancer Biology and Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine and the Center for RNAi and Non-Coding RNA; and Ilya Shmulevich, Ph.D., Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle.
This research was funded by the National Cancer Institute; the Blanton-Davis Ovarian Cancer Research Program, MD Anderson’s NCI Specialized Program in Research Excellence in Ovarian Cancer; MD Anderson’s Odyssey Fellows Program; and an ASLA-Fulbright Research Grant.
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ranks as one of the world’s most respected centers focused on cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. MD Anderson is one of only 40 comprehensive cancer centers designated by the National Cancer Institute. For eight of the past 10 years, including 2011, MD Anderson has ranked No. 1 in cancer care in “Best Hospitals,” a survey published annually in U.S. News & World Report.

There will be a second collection at all the Christmas Masses. This collection is for Christmas Charities for Children and Youth. Please be as generous as you can.
The Christmas Eve 4:00 Mass is the "Children's Mass"! Needless to say it is wonderful on one hand, and noisy and chaotic on the other. If you have no young children, you would be well advised not to attend this Mass. The 7:00 pm Christmas Eve Mass is filled with some folks standing. The 10:00 pm Christmas Eve Mass is filled, but with extra seating available. The Christmas Day 10:00 am Mass is a great time to come to Mass for Christmas: it is not too early and there is room for all to be seated. Think about changing you routine at Christmas and coming to the Christmas Day Mass. Fr. Ken
Thank you to those who participated in St Scholastica's Christmas Gift Project. Generous donations from our parishioners will help make Christmas more hopeful for many less fortunate children in our area, and for children in Haiti and Kenya. Your donations are appreciated very much!
Any Middle school or high school youth (and their family) that would like to participate in the December 29th snowtubing trip to Seven Springs should contact Jamie Dillon by December 19.
We will be selling gift certificates after Masses this Sunday, December 18th. A wide variety will be available including Giant Eagle, Community and Whole Foods. Cash or checks (payable to CDTCA) will be accepted. Thank you for your continued support.
Our call to stewardship includes all of the ways in which we receive God's gifts with gratitude, cultivate them, and share them with others. Find more news in the online version of Stewardship Corner at our parish website: www.saintscholastica.com. Look for "Stewardship Corner" in the Quick Links.
This weekend we are collecting dried beans for the food pantry at East End Cooperative Ministry in East Liberty. Please place donations in the food bin in the vestibule of the church. Thank you!
Thanks to all who contributed to all of our Christmas giving projects! Your generosity has flowed to local people and families and to others, especially children, in West Virginia and as far away as Good Samaritans School in St. Marc, Haiti, and Hekima Place in Kiserian, Kenya. For some Christmas joy, search for HEKIMA_CHRISTMAS.wmv on YouTube.
Parishioners in the Ministry of Praise volunteer to pray at home for parish needs and parishioner requests. A list is sent to them every two months. If you would like to join this group, or have a prayer request, please contact Mary Catherine Scanlon at: prayerlist@saintscholastica.com.
I am pleased to announce that the Notre Dame Chorale will be coming to our parish in January. They will be here to participate in the 5:00 pm Mass on Saturday, Jan. 14th. They will then present a concert following this Mass. We encourage you to mark that date on your calendar. Also, we need host families who will be able to house students overnight on the 14th. To register as a Host Family you may contact Stephanie Bonaroti, she is from our parish and is with the Notre Dame Chorale. Stephanie's email is: sbonarot@nd.edu. This is a good way to celebrate a New Year. Fr. Ken
This year the March For Life will be on Monday, January 23, in Washington, D.C. There will be a bus leaving from St. Scholastica Church going to the March For Life. We have been blessed to obtain tickets for the morning Youth Rally and Mass in Washington. Chaperons will be provided for students. The Mass is usually concelebrated by Cardinal Wuerl, the Papal Nuncio, and several hundred priests. We will join the March directly after the Mass. For more information please call Mary Catherine Scanlon at 412-781-6550.
Christmas cards are available. A set consists of 10 cards for $6. Your purchase helps the Pro Life cause. Call Mary Catherine Scanlon at 412-781-6550.
INFANT BAPTISM is celebrated at noon on the 2nd and 4th Sundays of the month. Please make arrangements with the pastor at least 6 weeks prior to the desired date.
RECONCILIATION (CONFESSION) is celebrated at St. Scholastica Parish on Saturdays after 9:00 a.m. Mass. For your convenience, the parishes in our cluster have the following opportunities for reconciliation:
Madonna of Jerusalem has reconciliation on Wednesday evening from 5:30-6:45 and Saturday from 3:00-4:00 p.m..
There were a bunch of folks who believed that the world was going to end in October of 2012. They based that belief on the supposed long count of the Mayan calendar. Since you're reading this, the world obviously didn't end. Of course, there are some dissenters who are holding out for December 21. Guess they won't be celebrating Christmas this year! Last year it was the people who followed Harold Camping who thought May 21, 2011, would be the last day. When it wasn't, Mr. Camping did a quick recalculation and informed everyone that it was really going to be October 21, 2011. Why is it that Americans seem to get caught up in these predictions? These are not just recent occurrences. The nineteenth century was rife with these kinds of predictions and movements. In uncertain times it may be that some people find a certain solace in having a date in their minds as to when things will end.
In this weekend's Gospel, Jesus points out that there are signs to accompany the end of time. The sun will darken and the moon will not give light. Scientists tell us we've only got about 4.5 billion years left on this one. As for the Son of Man coming in the clouds, Jesus has not left us with a date on which he is returning.
For those who can get wrapped up in predictions of this sort, the words of Jesus are pretty clear: "that day or hour, no one knows" (Mk 13:32). As Christians we don't need to know the date of Christ's return in glory. Whether it happens this afternoon or a million years from now really makes no difference. What is important is that we live our lives in such a way that we are always ready for his return. If we follow his commands, live according to Christ's law of love, and care for those in need, we will be ready whenever our Lord comes to take us home.
This weekend, we will be taking up a special collection for the retired religious brothers and sisters. These retired religious are the ones who taught us and served in our parishes many years ago. Now that they are retired they need our support in their elder years. Please be generous.
Two weeks ago I reported that on average 889 parishioners attend our four weekend Masses which is about 25% Mass attendance. This 25% attendance is about the average for all the 204 parishes of the Diocese of Pittsburgh. These are the average number of people attending Mass for each of the four Masses: 213 at the 5:00 pm Saturday Mass; 138 at the 7:30 am Sunday Mass; 240 at the 9:00 am Sunday Mass; and 309 at the 11:00 am Sunday Mass. It is more and more evident in this Year of Faith that we must reach out especially to those who have walked away from the Church or those who feel rejected or unwelcomed. Bring a friend or family member to Mass and promise to buy brunch!! Fr. Ken
Once again this year as part of our Advent preparation we have our Christmas Sharing Tree project. This weekend, November 17th-18th, we will invite you to come forward during Mass to take a tag or envelope from the tree. Each tag represents a gift for a needy person; the envelope represents a money donation to educate a child in Haiti or Kenya. All gifts and money donations are to be returned the weekend of December 8th-9th. Thank you for participating in this wonderful way to "prepare the way for the Lord." Fr.Ken
We will be selling gift certificates after all Sunday Masses this weekend, November 18th. A wide variety will be available including Giant Eagle, Labriola's, Community and Whole Foods. Cash or checks (payable to CDTCA) will be accepted. Thank you for your continued support.
Advent begins the weekend of December 1st and 2nd this year. It is time again to volunteer to light the Advent Wreath candles at each of the weekend Masses for the four weekends prior to Christmas. Sign the sheet found in the back of church to volunteer for the Mass of your choice. Please sign up by November 22nd.

· Nancy Heil sponsors a Thanksgiving program for poor families. Those who wish to donate a frozen turkey may do so only on Monday, November 19, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. During those hours, you may leave frozen turkeys only on the front porch at 318 Third St. Please do not deliver turkeys to the church.
· In addition, Nancy and her coworkers need many donations of stuffing mix (not just bread crumbs) and large, heavy throwaway aluminum roasting pans. Nancy's food pantry is completely out of large cans of spaghetti sauce. They also need canned vegetables of any kind. These items may be left in the usual donation area in the back of the church. Thank you for your generosity!
· Finally, Nancy asked us to print the following message from her about one of her Christmas giving programs. [Note: this is different from our parish Giving Tree program.]
"Our Christmas gift program is now underway. We accept any NEW items that would make good Christmas gifts—clothing, jewelry, toys, purses, socks and similar items. Please, only NEW items, and please leave the store tags attached. We use these gifts not only for homeless people, but for many needy families as well."
"Judy Ostrosky has headed this program for many years, and I would like to thank her for the endless hours she has devoted to helping make Christmas brighter for those in need. Judy's deadline for the NEW items is December 7."
· Finally, the Heils appeal to all: please do not leave items on their porch (except for the frozen turkeys on November 19th) or in the space between their house and the one next door. They are physically unable to deal with donations left in these areas. If you cannot leave a donation in our church bins, please contact Nancy's volunteers to arrange a delivery. There is contact information in signs on the Heils' porch and on the side basement door of the house next door.
Members of our youth group and adult helpers worked last Saturday on behalf of Catholic Charities. Congratulations to all who participated, following in Jesus' path of service!
The St. Monica Society was formed to pray for and reach out to families and parishioners who no longer worship with us. The group meets monthly on the first Saturday at 9:30 am to pray to the Holy Spirit, ask for the intercession of St. Monica and her son, St. Augustine, and to study and discuss ways to reach out to and welcome others. For more information, contact Mary Catherine Scanlon at: stmonica@saintscholastica.com.
The St. Scholastica Pastoral Council would like the members of the parish to be aware of the Council, what it is doing, and who its members are.

The 2012 Autumn Song Benefit Luncheon raised more than $10,000. The money will be used to fund Church and School projects, our Youth Ministry, and various local charities. In recent years, the funds raised have been used to repair the cement and steps in back of the church and to purchase liturgical vestments and altar cloths, new funeral pall and vestments, a cover for the Gospel book and other items that enrich our celebration of the Mass and other sacraments. The luncheon has been held annually for more than 50 years.
A special thanks to all the women of the parish who attend the benefit each year and those who purchase raffle tickets and support the event with their donations. In last week's list of donors, several names were inadvertently omitted. Local businesses who contributed to Autumn Song this year include: Weddell-Ajak Funeral Home, Thomas M. Smith Funeral Home & Crematory, McCabe Bros. Inc., Funeral Homes, Jimmy Wan's Restaurant, Loafers, Luke and Mike's Front Porch, Monogram It, Nancetta Ristorante and Vygor. The generous support of parishioners and local businesses insures the success of this event each year. A very sincere thank you to all!
St. Scholastica Parish would like to thank Tudi Mechanical Systems for their continued support of the St. Scholastica Bulletin. Please see their ad on the back page.

Progress of IEC 61850 has arrived in North America according to the March 2011 Newton-Evans Research report “Market Trends Digest, March 2011”.
The report found out interesting figures, e.g., “Within the Substation, IEC 60870-5-103 was the most frequently used protocol (40%). IEC 61850 (31%) fell close to serial protocols Modbus (31%) and DNP3 (33%), however, 24% indicated that they plan on implementing IEC 61850 within the substation by YE 2013. If that becomes the case, IEC 61850 will become the most used protocol by far.”
1 day Developers Workshop for IEC 61850 similar to the successful event at Myong Ji University, Yongin (RP of Korea)
NettedAutomation is confident, that their experience and service would meet all your expectations! You would get first-hand, very comprehensive, vendor neutral and up-to-date knowledge, experience, and guidance; learn how to reach interoperability of devices. NettedAutomation has trained more than 2.300 experts from more than 60 countries from more than 500 companies – all over.
Correctly speaking, the “ICD Designer” (as a product name) is a tool that has many functions for creating “IID Documents” – “Instantiated IED Description”. IIDs have been defined in edition 2 of IEC 61850-6 (SCL).
The tools supports also the instance specific binding of the model to the real world data points, e.g., referenced by DNP3 or 101/104 points. The tool uses an XML document with the TypeTemplates. Any extended model can easily be added to that XML document to define your own model. It is really that easy.
SystemCorp has implemented their stack software on the Beck IPC Chip SC143 in their IED "IEC 61850 WebCAN Substation Monitoring & Control System". The IED is a multifunctional monitoring and control system.
Test has been conducted according to the PICS, PIXIT, TICS, and MICS Documents that can be accessed through:
This is a major step towards the widespread use of the IEC 61850 stack from SystemCorp for small devices. The IEC 61850 software and the IEC 61850 communication behavior is almost completely implemented on the Beck IPC Chip SC143. Products that use the same chip with the software used for the conformance test would - by default - pass most crucial parts of the IEC 61850 conformance test.
The GPS time synchronization is one of the crucial underlying solutions for time synchronization in power system information sharing: in substations, between substation, and wide area applications (with or without applying IEC 61850).
A paper published by SEL discusses the issue of GPS time synchronization - and especially when it may become a single point of failure in a power system.
Event data can be logged in an IED by a Log according to IEC 61850-7-2 (IEC 61850-8-1, MMS Journal). The Log can be queried by time (before, between, after). This query returns MMS messages.
Logged event data in an IEC 61850 IED could now additionally be retrieved by an XML file called "COMFEDE":
This file may optionally rely on the information models defined by IEC 61850 Logical Devices, Logical Nodes, DataObjects, DataAttributes. An example of a file is shown here:
Even that standard is an IEEE standard, it could be understood as an extension of IEC 61850 - it extends the use of the information model, information exchange and system configuration language.
From a 40,000 ft point of view it is a kind of a SCSM (Specific Communication Service Mapping). I guess it is also easy in an IEC 61850 client to transform the ReadJournal response messages according to MMS into an COMFEDE file - it is the same payload carried.
Matthias Kurth, President of the German Federal Network Agency, is very supportive of IEC standards. In a short video he stated that "IEC can help put the innovative potential of industry on the right track so that we don't have island solutions: proprietary solutions that can hinder the growth of the market".
IEC can, according to Mr. Kurth, "help us to bring the different industry players together on common platforms which are transparent, open, and which are the basis of the individual innovation ... we need not to wait to renovate our own infrastructure [editor: meant is the energy sector] in Europe."
IEC has listed the crucial standards for Smart Grids in an Excel table. IEC 61850 seems to be understood as THE most crucial standard series for Smart Grids.
Mr. Kurth is right in requesting open standards as basis of innovation. The key innovations in the energy market needed will be the many SMART applications that keep the energy supply at a high level of availability - IEC 61850 and other IEC standards can help to support this objective! The easier it is to USE these standards the faster we can reach smart(er) applications.
One innovation is the simple IEC 61850 API developed by SystemCorp (Perth, Australia). The API can be used by application programmers immediately to develop SMART innovations for the energy market.
A successful Developers Workshop for IEC 61850 Client/Server and Publisher/Subscriber Applications was conducted at the Myong Ji University, Yongin/Korea, on 11 March 2011.
The interest was beyond expectations: 45 experts from all over of the RP of Korea attended the Workshop:
He explained the use of the API for different architectures (HW and SW) ... questions were discussed in English and Korean:
The attendees used the PCs of the lab and partly their own notebooks to run the API evaluation software. They exercised to configure the IEC 61850 server and to check the effect of SCL file modifications ... a great tool to work with.
After the workshop attendees told me that they have learned a lot about the standard, the stack software, the API, how easy it is to develop applications, and how to use the Beck Chip (with IEC 61850 @ Chip) in many different architectures. One crucial result was, that they figured out that the Beck Chip is a complete PC or PLC that can be used to implement applications (in C, C++ or IEC 61131-3) using IEC 61850 API. The Chip is much more than just a communication chip!!
Students will learn how to use an API for IEC 61850 (IEC 61400-25) for Client, Server (C/S), Publisher, and Subscriber (P/S) Applications. The API provides an IEC 61850 Stack (included in a Windows DLL) that is used by application software written in C, C++ and C#. Prior to the event, students will receive the DLL and sample executable and source code for the applications. Students that bring their own Notebooks will be trained to modify and extend the application examples. After the training sessions students can continue to write their own application software.
It is planned to repeat this workshop and provide more help for developers of IEC 61850 applications - the open and easy to use IEC 61850 platform is a crucial basis for the fast-to-market innovations of sustainable interoperable applications in the energy market.
The IEC TC 57 has proposed a new work with the title "System interfaces and communication protocol profiles relevant for systems connected to the Smart Grid".
The proposal states: "In order to achieve interoperable interfacing between the components, the consistent, cost efficient and unambiguous integration of the new domains into the IEC TC57 methods of energy management, architecture, data models and protocols is crucial."
The most prominent IEC TC 57 Data Models and Protocols are those defined in IEC 61850! New Domains are, e.g., Industry, Home and Building Energy Control Systems. My guess is that the various components in these domains have to communicate directly (interoperable) with IEDs in power systems. The Client/Server communication in IEC 61850 seems to be the most useful communication model applicable in the communication between power system IEDs and IEDs in the new domains. The application profile according to IEC 61850-8-1 requires just native TCP/IP !!
Since IP networks are (to be) installed everywhere, it is easy to apply IEC 61850-8-1 without any change in most applications. Many existing IEDs like the COM.TOMs from Beck IPC and others could be used right away! They can be used as IEDs for monitoring and control in the new domains or they can be used as gateways between IEC 61850 and protocols in the new domains like Backnet, Profibus, Interbus, EtherCAT, CAN, Modbus, ...
This will accelerate the application of IEC 61850! ... in order to make systems more energy efficient and smarter by seamless:
The ACSI was invented during a meeting of some experts that met here in Europe at the beginning of the project IEC 61850 (between 1995 and 1997). The reason was quite simple: We had TWO proposals for protocol profiles: (1) MMS TCP/IP and Ethernet (2) Profibus FMS. Each solution was supported by some 50 per cent of the members.
What to do now? I was deeply involved in the fieldbus standardization. We had so many fights since the late 80s ... which damaged the reputation of the standardization in the early 90s. I suggested NOT to fight in IEC 61850 but to define an abstract service model that could be mapped to MMS and to FMS. The first was specified in IEC 61850-8-1 and the second in IEC 61850-8-2. Even no official IEC draft has ever been published for IEC 61850-8-2.
Later we had a similar discussion in the project IEC 61400-25-4 in IEC TC 88 (Wind Turbines). We agreed to follow the approach of the abstract model of IEC 61850-7-2, to use the 8-1 MMS mapping, to add mappings for OPC XML DA, IEC 60870-5-101/104 and DNP3, and to define a concrete webservice for each abstract service of the ACSI.
My observation is, that (with some exceptions) ALL applications of IEC 61850 apply the MMS mapping ... that does not mean that everybody likes MMS ;-)
The conformance of devices with IEC 61850 has several aspects that are mainly specified in the following documents:
Which Communication services are supported ... Click HERE for a complete example (all examples shown here are for A specific IED: RTU of SystemCorp); the stack software from SystemCorp offers more.
Please ask your vendor of the IEDs or tools (you want to apply) for these documents. They provide you a good level of details you need to know when building multi-vendor systems.
After the Meeting of the IEC TC 57 WG 10 (Core IEC 61850) in Noosa (Queensland, Australia) four IEC 61850 Gurus of the Working Group 10 went down to Sydney to meet another IEC 61850 Guru to conduct a 3 day Tutorial and hands-on Training on 07.-09. March 2011.
The tutorial was a great Success! 48 attendees from 15 Utilities (!!) and 5 from 4 other companies attended the four half-day sessions in four parallel streams from Monday noon-time to Wednesday noon-time.
After this event it is likely that Australian utility engineers are ahead of the market - in most countries utility engineers are - more or less - watching the vendors commissioning and "turning on" TURN-KEY substation automation systems in their substations!! Usually - to my observation and experience - utility engineers have NO IDEA what they got delivered. Australian utilities are quite serious in getting deeply involved in specification, engineering, system integration, ...
NettedAutomation GmbH (Karlsruhe/Germany) will present the latest developments in products for IEC 61850 during the
Information of the public, of vendors, grid operators and other stakeholders of the energy market, of universities and research institutes about the running lighthouse projects
Discussion of the broad dissemination of the project results and how to overcome the existing barriers.
IEC Standards like IEC 61850 play a key role in the future Power Generation, Transmission and Distribution Systems. Several presentations and a workshop deal with THE Global accepted and used standard IEC 61850 in the context of Distribution Systems.
ABB's 800xA Automation System has been successfully tested for compliance with IEC 61850 recently. Bringing the world of process and power automation together is more than just a "nice to have". It is key to cost saving.
"The IEC 61850 standard ... has lowered the investment barrier for customers to integrate the process and power devices on their plant floors. The demand for integrated process and power automation is growing in traditional markets that are heavy energy users, such as Oil and Gas, Power Generation, Pulp and Paper, Minerals and Metals industries.
By integrating power and process systems on the common 800xA platform, customers optimize the design and performance of their electrical and automation systems and see additional benefits in reduced maintenance, engineering and overall lifecycle costs. According to ARC, typical savings can result in a 20% reduction in CAPEX (capital expenditures) and OPEX (operating expenditures) by integrating these two, usually separate, automation infrastructures."
IEC 61850 is THE crucial "link" within power automation systems and between power automation systems and any other automation system - it is likely that it will impact the whole process automation world. Why? Because it meets many crucial requirements in the cooperation of automation and SCADA devices by defining information objects like "circuit Breaker, XCBR" or "electrical measurement of 3-phase system, MMXU", a system configuration language (SCL) and information exchange services (read/write, reporting and logging events, control, real-time exchange, file transfer, ...). And it's based on native protocols like Ethernet, TC/IP, MMS, ... Any device that has Ethernet and TC/IP connectivity could use IEC 61850.
IEC 61850 has been implemented in hundreds of devices. The UCA Users Group lists some 181 certified devices with server functionality, 3 certified clients, and 2 Merging units (as per 2011-03-02; UCAIug Testing Quality Assurance Program).
Almost all of these devices provide a certain functionality like protection or control. Usually the devices do not provide a simple API (application program interface) that can easily be used by an application program written by a programmer. There is usually nor access to "IEC 6150 Stack". Some test tools may provide restricted access by manually entering values for a data attribute, or using a configurable simulation or providing a CSV (comma separated values) file for a profile. The evaluation licenses are usually quite restricted.
In contrast to this quite limited access to an API there is a free available server and client DLL (from SystemCorp) that runs for six (6) months. The DLL evaluation package comes with various client and server applications. The applications are provided in exe code and source code (C/C++ and C#). You have FULL control over the functionality YOU want to have for your client and server application.
The following example shows the .Net / C# client application provided by NettedAutomation GmbH. The received sequence of values can easily be copied and pasted:
Whatever you need - JUST program it ... or link the client and server applications to your real applications ... which may also be masters to any communication slaves like DNP.3, IEC 60870-5-101/103/104, Modbus, Profibus, CAN, ... This way you can easily and fast build your own GATEWAY. Just link the DNP.3 or 104 points to the DLL by YOUR IEC 61850 server application that is bound to corresponding Model. See next figure:
By the way, the API (and the underlying IEC 61850 stack) is also available on the embedded controller from Beck IPC for simple and FAST TO MARKET applications. All you program in C/C++ on a PC could be done on the Chip platform ... the Chip also supports IEC 61131-3 (CoDeSys) and soon ISaGRAF.
NettedAutomation offers public and in-house training courses using a comprehensive set of crucial evaluation tools - including the one shown here.
The 61850 Test Harness (one big package) has been divided in to three separate products, functionally extended and renamed to IEC 61850 Test Suite:
RIP: Legendary rapper Dwight Arrington Myers — better known as Heavy D — passed away today at the age of 44.
The former frontman of hip hop pioneers Heavy D & the Boyz was rushed to an LA hospital near his Beverly Hills home around noon, and was reportedly awake at the time. However, he was pronounced dead soon after arrival.
D found mainstream success with the 1991 hit single “Now That We Found Love.” The group remained popular throughout the early 90s, peaking with 1994’s Nuttin’ But Love, which hit #1 on Billboard’s Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The Boyz and D went their separately ways shortly thereafter.
Heavy D, who found some solo success in the late 90s, recently returned to the charts after adding reggae to his repertoire.
I’m in the midst of moving the site over to SSL/HTTPS for administration purposes at least. Which means changing my backend security and so on; which proved to be a bear where graphics where relative rather than direct links. Ah well. It’s working now. The Upgrade is working too! I have a valid SSL cert (I think) and it appears to be working.

If you think that Siberia is an unwired wilderness full of bears and lacking IT, think again — especially about Tomsk.
Tomsk is a notable educational and scientific center and one of the largest sources of IT specialists in Russia thanks to its six state universities:
Our universities offer a wide variety of courses, from fundamental classic to the latest trending technology, and are included on the international ratings lists.
Top schools produce top IT specialists and top IT specialists mean a major concentration of tech companies.
As is common elsewhere, we study trends, stay current with fast-changing technology, and most of us read, write and speak English. Along with all this, we have gorgeous wilderness areas, with great hiking, skiing, etc. That’s why NTR located a major development office here.
Additionally, one of Russia’s Special Economic Zones is located in Tomsk and our company is one of the residents. The specialty of the Tomsk Economic Zone is Technology and Development. I’m a native and proud of my hometown.
This was the sixth DevPRO’18 and it gets bigger every year. There were 700 attendees, 150 companies, and 30 speakers, including foreign speakers from the US, Netherlands and France.
The conference had five sessions: Trends, Web, Enterprise, Management, and Mix. At Trends there were great talks, including AI, Machine learning, Neural Networks and development. PPT and recordings of talks will be available shortly at the Conference website.
As at any conference, some of the best stuff happens during the breaks. It’s the time to check out the exhibitions and, most importantly, meet people, network and make connections.
In the picture below our colleagues Leonid Bulyga and Boris Pakilla are taking part in activities. The device is called Mindball and it measures brain activity. Here they compete to see whose activity is higher.
Leonid Bulyga, Drone Navigation Developer at NTR Lab: “To win it is necessary that the ball reaches the side of the opponent. Each has 3 indicators, one red circle is visible. This is the degree of brain activity. So our brain activity reached the top.” And our Leonid won!
In a scene from The Big Bang Theory, Sheldon is trying to blow up Leonard’s brain. Leonid is a major fan, so he copied Sheldon’s move when he tried to blow up his Mindball opponent’s brain — and succeeded.
Aleksandr Remkhe, Project Manager at NTR Lab, summed it up perfectly: “I’m delighted with the quality of the conference organization. Collect 700 people from the IT sector and from different cities. Invite experienced and bright speakers from several countries and highlight the most relevant topics. Take into account so many details — corporate identity, convenient and functional application for the conference and an excellent Siberian snack.
The original completion of the official part — meeting with the directors of IT companies. And this is all in small, cozy Tomsk.
From the speakers I want to mention Mark Smith. A professional in his field and an interesting speaker, listening to him is sheer pleasure. Justin Filmer and Daniel Doronkin shared live communication experiences in different time zones. Personally, I used that information on the next week.
About meeting with IT company directors — it was very useful to learn from the top people in IT Tomsk, what they expect from their employees, what qualities they welcome and in what vector they expect development.
This is annual conference. See you in Siberia next year! Tomsk is a town of great universities, where talented and inspired people gather.
Remember! NTR Lab develops unique technology solutions that others can’t. Contact our CEO Nick Mikhailovsky directly at nickm@ntrlab.com to explore what we can do for your business.
Usually I do not read post on blogs, but I would like to say that this write-up very pressured me to take a look at and do so! Your writing taste has been amazed me. Thank you, quite nice article.

Mavet signifies “death” and “severe illness,” as in “His heart died (va-yamot) within him, and he became as a stone” (1 Sam. xxv. 37), that is, his illness was severe. For this reason it is stated concerning the son of the woman of Zarephath, “And his sickness was so sore, that there was no breath left in him” (1 Kings xvii. 17). The simple expression va-yamoth would have given the idea that he was very ill, near death, like Nabal when he heard what had taken place.
Some of the Andalusian authors say that his breath was suspended, so that no breathing could be perceived at all, as sometimes an invalid is seized with a fainting fit or an attack of asphyxia, and it cannot be discovered whether he is alive or dead: in this condition the patient may remain a day or two.5
R. Yosef Qafiḥ is quite confident that Rambam is accepting the traditional view that the son of the woman of Sarepta had actually died, and not the approach of “one of the Andalusians” that he had not, and he scathingly dismisses the opposing understanding of Rambam’s position:

Apple said Monday that iPad sales have topped two million in less than 60 days since it first launched in the U.S. on April 3.
Word of the milestone comes just days after the Cupertino-based company expanded sales of the device to international markets, shipping units in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.
Customers around the world are experiencing the magic of iPad, and seem to be loving it as much as we do, said Apple chief executive Steve Jobs. We appreciate their patience, and are working hard to build enough iPads for everyone.
In April, Apple announced that it would delay international availability of the iPad by roughly a month's time after the company discovered that domestic demand for the device was far outpacing its estimates.
The company initially sold 500,000 iPad's during the device's first week on the market. That number doubled three weeks later when Apple announced on May 3rd that it had shipped its millionth unit.
On average, Apple would appear to be selling just over 35,700 iPads each day and the company boasts a catalog of over 5,000 new applications for the touch-screen device that have been authored by its developer community.
Apple also said Monday that the iPad will be available in nine more countries in July and additional countries later this year.

Howard Boetcher, Seaman Second Class, son of Mrs. Vera Boetcher, 544 Balcom Street, participated in the first wave of the invasion of France, according to word received here. He was stationed on an LCT landing boat, which operated on the coast of France. Since the invasion, Boetcher has bagged two German rifles and a German sub-machine gun.
Entering the service in January 1943, he received his training at Great Lakes, IL and Treasure Island, CA. After serving in the South Pacific Theater of Operations, he was sent to England in February last.
He was graduated from Eau Claire Senior High School in 1942. His brother, Charles, will leave Thursday for the Navy.
Howard Boetcher, Seaman First Class, and his brother, Private Charles Boetcher, have returned to their respective posts, after visiting their mother, Mrs. Vera Boetcher, 544 Balcom Street. Howard had taken part in the invasion of France. He was on a 30-day leave here, following an appendicitis operation. He is now at Norfolk, VA for reassignment. Charles was home for 15 days during that time and is now at a port of embarkation.
"We went in around noon on D-day and it took the Infantry 36 hours to reach the top of the hill with fierce fighting," Robert H. Bortle, Seaman Cook, Second Class, U.S. Navy, said during an interview today. Bortle is the son of Mr. and Mrs. Bruce Bortle, 413 Ninth Street, and was on an LCT, Amphibious Landing Craft, when France was invaded.
He entered the Navy on February 15, 1943 and received his boot training at Great Lakes. He went overseas in April of this year and was in Wales and England before going to France.
"Opposition consisted of machine guns, rifle fire, and mortars," he said. "Our craft was marked by a ship already sunk behind us, but we escaped with only a few dents in the bow and no casualties."
He told of the rough fighting in the area where the landing craft, which he was serving on, put into shore because they were unlucky enough to draw the spot where concentrated German troops were holding maneuvers at that time.
Bortle was right on the coast of France for three months, unloading merchant ships under the British command. When he left the battle zone, it was "pretty much quieted down, except for shelling from a hidden gun for about an hour each night," he said.
He told of seeing an Eau Claire boy after the invasion, while he was still in France, Howard Boetcher, who is serving on a LCT.
Bortle said he expected to go to the South Pacific area to serve aboard a LSM in the Amphibious Forces, when he leaves here, upon completion of his 20-day leave.

As a global boycott movement against Israeli universities gains steam, Israeli professors say they are feeling the pressure from their colleagues overseas. Although the movement ostensibly targets universities, not individuals, Israeli academics say they are often shunned at the personal level. They experience snubs at academic conferences, struggle to get recommendations and can experience difficulty publishing their work in professional journals.
170 academics [right now, Feb 19: 312] from more than 50 Italian universities and research institutes have signed a pledge committing to a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. For the actual call: click here!
"200 Brazilian academics to join the boycott of Israel" (Palestine News Network, Jan 21, 2016): click here!
In just three days, an online letter endorsing the academic boycott of Israeli institutions circulated by Brazilian intellectuals, received 200 signatories from faculty across Brazilian universities.
The growing delegitimization of Israel is this country's own handiwork. Should Israel decide to end apartheid, it will return to being legitimate in every respect... There's no boycott against states worse than Israel? Israel, which aspires to and can become one of the world's most enlightened countries, a light unto the nations, is not allowed to make such an argument.
The E.U., in short, is cannier, fairer, and stronger than the B.D.S. movement, though its sanctions may be misconstrued as calculated to add to the movement’s prestige. The real challenge to Israel’s economy, and sense of purpose, will not be B.D.S. but successive Likud governments that expect educated Europeans to buy into the idea that “terror” justifies what they’re doing.
British doctors have called for the removal of Israel from the World Medical Association (WMA) over claims of “medical torture” on Palestinians seeking treatment.
A group of prominent intellectuals and activists is defying France’s crackdown on the Palestine solidarity movement by publicly calling for the boycott of Israeli goods.
Amduscias is a demon and a powerful Grand Duke of hell with 29 Legions to his name and is the demon most connected to music with Goetia’s attributing him to bending music to his will.
On her right arm are the symbols for Cinder, Penetrate, and then the Sigil of Amduscias, followed by the words “Ave Satanas” on her wrist. On her left arm are the words “Music is Life”, the symbol for Sulfur, and the Sigil of Lucifer.
Her shirt says “In Nomine Dei Nostri Satanas”, a shorter version of the Latin Phrase “In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi” (In the name of our God, Satan Lucifer of the Most High). On her stomach is “For thi is the glory.” Both are references to “Ora Pro Nobis Lucifer” by Behemoth. “Thi” is a bit of a play on words: The actual words are “For thine is the glory.” Since it leads to her thigh, I think you get the rest.

I'm Lex Spoon, a software engineer working in Atlanta, Georgia. I'm a coauthor of Programming in Scala.
I've had a hard time explaining my views on package distribution. Let me try and wrap it up this way: DLL hell is a job description. Dealing with it is a work that has to be done, one large enough to consume full-time work. When DLL hell is really problematic is when that work falls on end users who aren't even software experts.
Break that down. First of all, I don't see how the root problem can be avoided. Large software is built modularly. The software is broken into components that are maintained and advanced by independent teams. No matter how hard they try, and no matter what advanced component system they use, those teams will always introduce unexpected incompatibilities between different versions of different components. I am highly sympathetic to WCOP's goal of controlling external dependencies, though I see it as a goal that can only be partially fulfilled.
Second, there is a role to play in finding versions of components that are compatible with each other. My favorite approach is that taken by Linux distributions, where within one distribution there is only one version of each component. Less centralized approaches are also plausible, but they have severe difficulties. An example would be Eclipse Plugins. However, in that example, it mostly appears to work well only when the functionality added is minor and the plugins being added don't interact with each other very much.
With all of that foundation, the DLL hell of Microsoft Windows is much easier to talk about: End users are playing the same role as those making a Linux distribution. Even computer specialists will resent this undesired work, and most users of Windows are not computer specialists. The only good way I see to fix this is to shift the distribution-making work onto some other group. That's challenging with Windows software being sold per copy, but perhaps it can be made to work with enough red tape. Alternatively, perhaps Windows could move over to a subscription model where the application bits can be freely copied. If the bits could be freely copied, then Windows distributions could sprout just as easily as Linux distributions have.
It’s hard to believe I’m writing this post while I’m in Daugu, Korea 🙂 Feeling very grateful for the opportunities to travel to the most amazing countries I have only dreamed of. I am speaking at a 4 day photography conference for the Professional Photographers of Korea. They have been so kind, and they are the most hospitable group of people I have met – plus a heap of fun!
Anyway enough about my adventures 🙂 the real reason for this post is to share some photos of my brand new Brisbane Newborn Photography Studio. My husband and I have been planning this space for the past 3 years and it was finally completed 2 weeks ago – making ME the happiest baby photographer around!
My very talented Husband designed and created the shelving unit for all of my newborn props – which couldn’t be more perfect! 😀 He has done an incredible job putting the whole studio together – and with a little help from of our good friend Garrett.
And my stunning hand painted backdrop was created by Conny Rogers who has just started offering them to photographers. The two canvas prints hanging on the wall are printed by Brilliant Prints.

Hi, I am photogrepher from Singapore. I wish I could receive any information about future workshops in Singapore?
I am transitioning from HS seniors and engagements as a S&B to families and newborns. I have taken 36 hours of safety classes and my background is a pediatric and NICU nurse. I am located in the US and would be so very interested in a posing class in the US.
You inspired me To become à newborn photographer. I Will die To receive you in my studio near Paris France ! If you plan to come IN France to make a workshop may sure many students are waiting for this Event !!!
I’m currently watching your “Baby Safety and Posing for Newborn Photographers” series and it is great! I’d highly recommend it to any photographer who wants to improve their newborn photography.
I would love to attend one of your workshops in person! I’ve watched all of your CreativeLive ones! I live on a small island in Alaska and there are never any workshops that come here..Seattle would be the easiest place to get to go to one for me! I hope to see you add that location to your list!
You had me from your very first Creative Live broadcast so many years ago. I have modeled so much of who I am as a photographer after not just your style of photography, but the way in which you conduct yourself and how you respect and regard each precious newborn. From your soft, delicate touch, to your knowledge and respect of baby’s needs – you have empowered me more than you’ll ever know. I will keep my eyes open for info. to come regarding your workshops. I’ve added San Francisco as a possible location for ya! I know you will love it! Fingers crossed on this end! xo
You have inspired me from the moment I decided to become a newborn photographer, which just happened to be at the same time your did your creativelive bootcamp 2 yeas ago! I have since bought more of your classes and anytime I need to be inspired before a session or just need a mental “top up” I watch them again. Thank you for sharing your passion and your beautiful art with the rest of the world! Perhaps one day in the future you can come to western Canada for a workshop! I can even provide the space to do it in 🙂
I would be absolutely amazed to do a workshop with you Kelly… Your work is to die for and training with you would be amazing. can’t wait to get some more information about the London workshops.
Kelly, I live in Texas but I’m coming to Russia in June! I wish I could join you there! Love your work. I watched all CreativeLive videos.
I’m wondering if there will be a workshop in France, Italy or Switzerland this year? I’d love to be there if that’s the case!
I live between this 3 countries, in the alps close to Chamonix. If you ever imagined to come here to teach, I’d love to host a workshop. We never get tired of these amazing views!
Hi, I am photogrepher from Bulgaria- Europe. I wish I could receive any information about future workshops in Europe?
I am really really intrested in doing the 2 day posing course hopefully early next year & just wanted to know how I find out dates etc and book.
I will be attending the Baby Summitt in Oct and I am so looking forward to meeting you. I am a newer photographer and ready to sign a lease for my new studio and really reaching out to the professionals in this industry. I am drawn to your approach and style. I would like to buy your book, videos etc. Will you be offering discounts at the Summit?
I’m a amateur newborn Photographer and staying in Hartbeespoortdam (near Johannesburg/Pretoria) any possibility that you might offer a newborn workshop in South Africa.
I purchase all you’re video courses on Creative Life and enjoy every class and detailed information during each session. I also purchase you’re E-book Newborn Photography Guide and almost all you’re Photoshop courses. But i would like to do a hands on workshop with you and to learn from the best. Can you please send me your’e workshop dates for 2016/2017 in Australia and London to make a oplan to attend one of you’re workshops …….
Hi Kelly would like to attend one of your newborn posing classes if you could please provide details of your next available I would really appreciate it,
I realise you are just coming off the back end of some amazing training and travels but was wondering if at any point in the near future you may have some workshops available in Melbourne?
I think that THE pressing issue is mertcis and measurement for social media. We cannot duck the ROI questions any longer. Corporations and other organizations have dived into social media with vigour. Now, we must find ways to assess the results of the social media programs. Do we measure results by conversions? By engagement? By something else? And what algorithms can we agree on.A panel on Social media mertcis and measurement would be a worthy agenda item for Mesh08.
Is there anyone out there that would like to do the Sydney 2 day intensive workshop, l have paid the deposit and have a spot but life has taken a twisty turn and cannot go to the workshop. Feel free to email mltyter@bigpond.com if you would like this spot.
Have you visited Bonny Scotland at all yet? It would be great if you could have a workshop here while you are in the UK. I would love to learn from you, from the best x

Once I get back from overseas in April I will announce the dates. At this stage it looks like the class will be in late November.
Hi Kelly! Just to say that I love your work and would like to follow you in Barcelona. I see that all the spots are sold so I would like to be in a “waiting list” if one of this spots are available later. Im a new photographer and learning from you most of the the things I know, you are inspiring all my new work so it will be a dream to learn from you. I still dont have website, no good logo, no marketing, even I still didnt earn one euro with photography, but I want to begin in the best conditions and that means to learn from the best nb photographer in the world: you. I let you my fb page. Regards, Ana.

Just wondering if you ever come to Sydney and if not is there any spots left for the Brisbane class?
Thank you for contacting me. I’m currently in Seattle about to teach a class on creativeLIVE with Sue Bryce. I have been receiving emails but unfortunately having problems sending them. I definitely have a spot for you at the workshop in Melbourne on the 6th Oct. If you have any questions and need to contact me – you can message me via my Little Pieces Photography page on Facebook 🙂
If you were interested I am definitely keen, and have a number of colleagues also wanting more posing etc. tuition, especially from someone like yourself.
Also, how much of a deposit do you require for your Australian workshops? And do you offer a payment plan?
Could you please email me with what I need to do to register for the above workshop in Brisbane. Also, could you please let me know some info on your one-on-one mentoring. I’m not sure what would be better for me at this stage.
Very interested in the Melbourne workshop. How much of a deposit do you require and do you organise payment schedules in the lead up to the course?

Can you please send me some details about this and any other workshops you have coming up next year thanks
When will you be posting dates for next year? Id love to get into your workshop. I just joined the aipp as an emerging member
I was wanting to enquire about a workshop in Melbourne or Victoria anywhere. I you have any dates available and price.
Could you please advise when your next workshop availability would be and if you intend on coming to Newcastle or Sydney for workshops.
Would love to do this- do you think you would do one in Adelaide??? Though I do have a friend who lives in Mandurah and I could visit her at the same time – just the problem of my 3 mth old son who is BF, so would be sooo much better if you could come to Adelaide
Can you please advise if you are able to travel to me for mentoring sessions in Townsville as I have three people who would like to attend a class and I have an excellent supply of newborn models. Or when your next class is in Brisbane as I am happy to travel.
Hello Kelly, I’m interested in your one-on-one classes for posing newborns. Could you please email me some info? I’m in North Brisbane.
I’m interested in your one-on-one mentoring, as I know you’re not going to have group classes in Brisbane this year. Please send me some info regards to whatever you offer, I’m really keen and would love to be inspired by you 🙂
Hello, I’m interested in your one-on-one and also group classes for posing newborns. Could you please email me some info? I’m in North Brisbane.
Hi there. Would you mind emailing me re: your one on one classes please? Caroline@mihajaphotography.com.au. Thank you xx
I am wondering if you have any spots remaining in your workshops in Brisbane, particuarly on the 6th of November 2011? I have a nephew due to arrive later this month and i’m trying to prepare 🙂
Hi Kelly, I am interested in enrolling in the next class. I am also pregnant & looking for a photographer to take some maternity shots.
I was just wondering if you still had availability in your Sydney workshop on 26 November. If you could let me know that’d be great!
Want to be part of the action? LOST BETS POV lets you feel like you're right there beating the pants off the girls!
A fan by the name of BD Suit twigged me to these. They're great: they're the most barely-there bottoms it's possible to wear. I doubt anyone would want to wear one in public who wouldn't want to be totally nude in public, because that's about what they will be. In today's update, Episode 322, two girls find themselves experiencing that nightmare. Enjoy. (Might be just a little bit late.)
I loved this game. Great reluctance and embarrassment. The c thongs looked amazing. Are there any more of these three and if so what are they risking in terms of forfeit?
@K: Glad you liked it! "At least I get to keep my dignity!" "Yeah, I see all your dignity hanging out." Sadly, this is the last one (for now) with these three. But I'd definitely like to get them back for more.
I can see the fun in embarrassing pictures on the losers, but maybe next time you do public exposure or post pictures, try no drawings, just the birthday suit.
Or, if you want to use markers, have people write ratings (numbers) for their bodies or tits so the will be covered in favorable or unfavorable ratings in the end.
I just had a great idea. Next time if the Person Loses they get walked about in a extremely revieling peice like now. The catch to this one is Free pics of the loser is spread around to random passerbyers who would like to have them.
Speaking of POVs I cant remember any POVs with a blowjob forfeit. Do you have any like that. Or perhaps if thats too standard maybe you could do a game between two girls with the forfeit being oral filmed from the winners POV. Wonder if that would interest people.
Well I certainly hope the c thong makes another appearence. So far it has been the hottest walk of shame garment to date. Im glad to see that 2 of the last three forfeits have been purely enf. I look forward to see more like them.
@Anon 10:57 (please sign your posts): Um, maybe. It might be a bit of a challenge to find girls who'd be willing to risk that level of pain.
@AV: I was actually thinking the same thing while reviewing this one: the drawing with markers is fun, but especially in a case like this, where the girls are virtually naked, bare pink skin might be a better look. Having members of the public write stuff on them would be pretty cool, too. But risky. Would depend where we were, I guess.
@DaM: You want the girls to be carrying naked pictures of themselves which they'd hand out to random passersby? Fun, but even riskier. Although I've been tempted to make the nearly-nude girls invite likely people back to the hotel room for a nude photoshoot...
I'm not making any promises on when the PoVs will finally appear, since I've broken so many such promises in the past, but I've got well over 50 of them on film now. I may as well publish them at some point.
@Pareto: I have shot one PoV blowjay and plan to shoot more. I'm not sure how well they work either, but we'll see.
@K: We'll C about the C-thongs returning. They worked great, but that particular bar in that partiuclar hotel has asked us to knock it off. Seems some of hte patrons complained. I doubt any complained about the show, it was more about the cameras. So I'll need to find a new place if I'm going to break them out again.
I loved the game! I know you've already said bringing the C string back is tough, but I'd totally pay to see it again! And hopefully with some of the other girls too! I would give anything to see someone like Ashley or Candle have to do something like that!
The public nudity forfeits remain my favorite. While I understand the limitations in that they usually aren’t actually fully nude in the forfeit, I was very interested to see if the c-thong moved us closer to true nude in the true public environment. So this one was clearly required viewing and inspired me to write a full review for the blog. It contains plenty of spoilers so be warned.
The Game – The camera work was spot on. All the girls did a great job of showing the goods when stripped. The viewers always win when the competitiveness of the players pushes for early nudity and pants go before shirts. Winner’s choice for striping is a mandatory rule. Clearly, none of the girls wanted to lose. And the game dynamics created some drama with Catherine losing early and then it still coming down to her and one card to determine the final winner. The game gets a perfect score in my book when all the players end up naked. Credit to Caroline for commenting on the order of card taking but fate is fate.
The Players – All the girls looked great. I found myself most interested in seeing Kimberly strip as the game went on. Catherine has a great rack and pussy cleft and I enjoyed many clear shots of it. Caroline’s facial expressions kept me entertained. She’s got a great overall body. The banter was great with the trash talking early and all of them really getting into the game. I liked the look on Caroline’s face when she lost with her sideways smile. She was like McKayla Maroney at the Olympics. The players really made the game enjoyable to watch. They are a great group of girls.
The Forfeit – When the c-thongs made their appearance, immediately I was like “Wow, that’s small!” And they just do cover the lower front. I don’t know what a really hairy girl would do which would be hilarious. I did not like the markers. I think they distracted from the “nudity” element. I think they need to be limited to lostbest.com on the shoulders. It was funny how Kimberly was so happy to win and decorate the ladies that she seemed to forget she was naked. She pretty much stopped trying to cover up.
Normally, I would want bigger and well-endowed girls to lose these games since they have more to hide. In this case, the c-thong and the losers were a clear match because the c-thong does not block anything in back for girls with some booty in back. And those were the best views. Women should always wear high heels and that combination with the c-thong made for the best views of the forfeit. Caroline has a great ass and it was rocking down the hall at the 19:56 mark. That is the clear image left in my mind. Plus Catherine’s great breasts looked great even with tape.
As for the walk down and the bar, the full elevator created quite the reaction. Plus the random plushie on there, wtf? As for the bar part, the pictures being taken was cool. But some of the patrons clearly ignoring them detracted some from the energy and gave it the wrong tension. It should be tension because the losers are embarrassed not because they are pulling a prank that irritates the public. But that is out of your control in this case.
Catherine – “I was the first one to get my pants taken off… and now I’m about to win.” (She doesn’t)
Final Summary – In my final assessment, I put this near the top of the public nudity games. Not the all-time best but in the ballpark and the groundbreaking c-thong was a clear success. Better than the g-string suit by far. See my updated personal favorites below.
A final recommendation, the puzzle for public nudity forfeits is if you want the loser to be fully nude, you need a controlled environment like running in the hall or ordering a pizza which seemed to the be the plan in the early episodes. Or if you want a longer, more interactive forfeit, they’ve got to have tape and a thong which is the recent plan. I have a suggestion going forward that might be the best of both. One of my all-time favorite clips is 133 where Raven is nude, hands behind back, being walked down the hall to a party. While the clip ends and we don’t see what happens, my imagination loves that ending. So that said, why not recreate that? Instead of the loser going down to the hotel bar, just have them led to another room. There you can have the room filled with your own folks to make up the “public”. Ideally, they would be people the players don’t know. Have the loser serve drinks and pose for photos. In the losers mind, while it is not as public as a hotel bar it should still have the same impact on them without the potential for trouble from the hotel or the law. This is similar to the parties or games in the past where you’ve had a gallery watching but in this case, the uncertainty and unknown should add to the drama and embarrassment. In a way, this is a variation on what Fear Factor did, search youtube fear factor Jessica.
I’ve been around since episode 1. It feels like just the other day that I was writing up the Best Awards to mark Episode 200. Keep up the great work. You are champion of men everywhere looking to escape into some fantasy.
037 – Strip Poker – Pizza guy gets lots of looks, good camera work and lighting give us the full view of the girls
209 – Lola in the thong. This remains my personal favorite. First, because it is an active game leading to the forfeit and second because the winner actually still wears bra and thong to the bar. And third, Mo’s rack is so awesome that the tape does nothing to cover it.
245 - Ashley messing with Cory and making her bend over and walk certain ways ranks this high. I consider it best of the g-string suit games.
183 - For some reason, I return to this game often. The game and forfeit is muted with neither girl really getting into it, but Navarre just seems very naked in the crowd. Plus her tear drop breasts look great even with tape.
Hey Red, I know it might be expensive but I hear there are C-thongs with built in vibrators that can be remote controlled. Just putting it out there- the one thing better than a nearly naked walk of shame is a nearly naked walk of shame while the clit gets teased.

Okay, it's been awhile (almost a year now) but I have finally posted a new POV. Watch Sassy try to take revenge for her humiliation in P146. She either succeeds or she doesn't; see both versions. Plus, I should have enough POVs on tap to resume weekly publication, so look for the next one next Wednesday.
In a couple of days, we'll meet Jesse and Jake who came along with their girlfriends Tessa and Jesse respectively in Episode 624. As usual, I started new players off with a simple game and a simple forfeit. The game is Spin the Bottle, well, sort of. I was bored and I coded an electronic version of Spin the Bottle as well as a few other games. You'll see. Two winners pose the two losers to give us all a show. If that's a bit soft for you, don't worry. Things will ramp up quickly.
We'll meet another new player, SarahBeth, in Episode 625. She plays with Stefanie making her long-awaited return. The game is Torange, and again in deference to the newbie, the loser gets posed for the camera.
Jake, Jesse, Leilani, and Tessa are back again in Episode 626. The men play darts, and high score each round gets to strip a piece from the loser's woman. The ultimate loser of the game is strapped helpless to the Greyjoy cross, forced to watch as the winners have their way with his girlfriend. I told you things ramped up quickly, diddn't I?
Carmen, Dylan, and Nancy star in Episode 627, playing Earth and Fire. The loser pays for her orgasm with her ass, taking a solid paddling. This was a weird game. The girls really seemed unclear on the concept, as they were slow and tender when on offense rather than trying to force the loser to cum as quickly as possible. I interrupted them several times to explain the game but they just didn't get it. Oh well, Cute girls fondling each other, right?
Longtime fan favorites Amber, Julie, and Sassy take each other on at Pirate Penguins in Episode 628. The loser's body gets slick and shiny as it's rubbed down with a large bottle of baby oil. That's another group that ramps up.
Carmen, Dylan, and Nancy are back for Episode 629. The loser of their game of Strip Rock-Paper-Scissors has to greet the pizza guy at the door naked. I might make this one part of a double-update weekend, since the pizza guy wasn't very cooperative and refused the offer to come inside for a lapdance, which I found a bit disappointing.
FYI, not the biggest thing in the world, but the preview clip for this week on Clips4Sale is at the very beginning of the video, so it only shows the LostBets logo and intro and not even a glimpse of any of the players.
Either the Loser/Losers can inflate their belly, or you can have it on your wheel of punishment. (Maybe the girl hast to plug up to keep her belly inflated). Or you can have a challange that gets harder and harder the bigger the belly gets?
Would you ever consider doing another team Sybian contest? Either as a punishment for a losing team or on it's own. Your old one is the hottest video on the internet and no other site has done one.
Just thought of something to add to the belly inflation punismhemt idea. If you have like a bunch of girls and belly inflation as one of the punismhemts on the punishment wheel, and there is one girl that really doesn't want to do it, you can add a rule where she can trade the punishent with another girl. So if the girl who took the belly inflation punishment loses, she can then have the girl who traded to her punishment :)
Glad to see the povs are back. The oral sex forfeit pov episodes are some of my favorite porn ever. I'd be so happy if you made more. Thanks!
Yeah, it would be great to see Sybian contest again. Except this time it could be combined with Earth and Fire. It would be game for 3,4 or 5 girls. First girl strip naked and sit on a sybian, while others try to make her squirt, while time is counting. After she is done next girl goes until all of the girls squirt. Girl with the least time (from the moment when she sit on a sybian till moment she squirt) gets punished.
No exact discreption of the forfeits in the new Sassy POVs Red? Assuming its something minor enough not to be listed in its own genre keyword. (ie its not a JOI/masturbation forfeit) which sucks ): been waiting this year for the return of the POV and I was one of the original and loudest voices to propose them in the first place! haha. When the girls break that 4th wall it is insaneeeeeeely hot and sexy. All the same keep up the good work legend
@D: I don't know if I'm allowed to post any spoilers but I think you'll be pleasantly surprised with Sassy's new POV ;)
Learn something new every day. Been around the block a few times but I have never heard of belly inflation as a sexual fetish. Had to Google it. Who knew?
"In a couple of days, we'll meet Jesse and Jake who came along with their girlfriends Tessa and Jesse respectively in Episode 624." I'm guessing the second Jesse should be Leilani based on the 626 text.
I love the paysite, but my one issue is the thumbnails. Part of the fun is the anticipation of seeing them strip and seeing who wins. The thumbnails give both away.
I bought 626 (and I'm delighted I did!) because seeing guys tied up and helpless to resist as their clothes are cut off and completely destroyed is one of my favorite things ever. I love that there's nothing they can do to prevent slowly becoming more and more exposed, and ultimately completely naked and exposed, unable to even use their hands to cover up.
(I would have taken his shoes and socks, too, but the ultimate would be the near-impossible-to-safely-film scenario of him being shown being released at the end and having to walk down the streets going home completely naked...)
Anyway, wasn't sure whether he'd be restrained dressed or naked. Reading the spoiler blurb showing that his clothes were cut off immediately sold me on it, and I'm glad I bought it.
Just wanted to drop by and give my thanks, I was keeping track for awhile looking out for when the POV would eventually be dropped, but then lost track. Was pleasantly surprised to see a couple POV's up now, and of course quickly got one. Keep up the fine work.
In 1963, I bought a new red Fairlane. I met my wife, dated, went on our honeymoon and brought our daughter home from the hospital in it. In 1968, I traded it off for a ’68 Torino, but I always wanted another 1963 Fairlane. About 14 years ago I found this one. It was in very bad shape. $30,000 later and a lot of hard work, I think it turned out pretty good. It has a strong 302 engine and a C4 transmission. I narrowed the 8″ rear end so I could fit larger wheels and wider tires. It has classic gauges, a Flaming River steering wheel and tilt column, and a Lokar shifter with a custom console. Front seats came out of a Mitsubishi Galant. Wheels are Cragar 390s. The color is 2007 Mustang Red. Hope you all enjoy the pictures!
Howard, I have a 1963 Sports Coupe with a 260 v8. I’ve added mag wheels and I have trouble with the rears scrubbing. How did you modify the rear end and by how much?
My first car was a ’63 Fairlane Sports Coupe. Ran the wheels off that thing, even did a little drag racing and managed to blow the rear (getting repaired here)

You know how it is, Holiday Season is one of those times where everything tends to be hectic and things have got to go fast. Well, no exception for ordering great customized books for your loved ones in time to put them under the Christmas tree.
Considering books have got to be printed and then sent to wherever you are in the world, if you want to have your books ready for Christmas and want to be able to tuck them in your loved ones' Christmas Sock, you need to get busy.
Our Customer survey showed that most people take around 10 to 30 minutes to make a great book. However, well, all this knowledge takes a little more time to be printed and shipped. So this week, the first 15 minutes you have available should be dedicated to make your customized Wikipedia books. Any order made before December 6th will get to you in time, any order after that date, we cannot guarantee that it will make it in time to the Christmas Tree. The good news is, our German customers have a little more time, as for them the deadline for any book shipped within Germany is the 15th of December.
Get going, start the book creator and make your book. If you're short of ideas, look up the posts we filed under our ideas tag, this should give you plenty of material to work with. In these times of end-of-the-year Season though, you might want to add a Yearbook to your collection (retracing all great events of the past year) or who knows, a book about Christmas and everything related to it!
And of course, don't forget all the beautiful-books goodness we've been introducing in the past few weeks, hard covers and color content for even more fantastic books.

On 27 March 2015 the Law on Amendments to the Law on Joint Stock Companies dated 19.03.2015 No. 272-VIII (hereinafter, the Law) came into effect. Under the Law, a general shareholders meeting is eligible subject to the participation registration of shareholders jointly owning more than 50 percent of the voting shares.
The Law has rendered the Law of Ukraine on Amendments to Article 41 of the Law of Ukraine on Joint Stock Companies invalid. It should be noted that the Law has delayed the reduction of the quorum for JSCs without a state share.
Also, the Law empowers a JSC’s general shareholders’ meeting to decide on shortened dividend payment terms. If dividends are not paid in due time, shareholders are entitled to apply to notaries for writs of execution, under which debts are recovered without recourse. The list of such documents shall be set by the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine.
Apart from that, it is established that the rights of shareholders to submit proposals on matters put on the agenda of the relevant JSC’s general shareholders’ meeting as well as regarding new candidates for members of the company’s bodies and the procedure for their submission may not be changed by the joint stock company’s articles of association. In case of early termination of powers of one or several supervisory board members and until its whole composition is elected, a supervisory board meeting shall be deemed eligible, provided that the number of active supervisory board members constitutes more than half of its members.
It is also stipulated that JSCs’ articles of association shall be applied to the extent that they do not contradict with the Law, until they are brought into line with it.
The Law applies only to JSCs and does not change the quorum requirements for meetings of other legal entities, including limited liability companies.
It should be noted that one of the key companies to be influenced by the new Law is "Ukrnafta", in which the minority shareholders have repeatedly blocked the conduct of general shareholders’ meetings, the change of management as well as the payment of dividends.
In our view, the establishment of a quorum at the legislative level was not necessary. Thus, in some European countries the law does not set any quorum for general shareholders’ meetings. In the Anglo-Saxon law system, there are no quorum requirements for general shareholders’ meetings at all, while in the US and the UK the eligible number of shareholders is that of the shareholders attending the meeting. We believe that the most reasonable solution is to entitle shareholders to determine the quorum, while the relevant provision should be integrated in articles of association rather than at the legislative level.
JSCs should amend their articles of association to bring them into line with the Law. The Law does not prescribe the term for such amendments or liability for failure to make them. However, the provisions of the Law prevail over JSCs’ articles of association regardless of whether the latter have been brought into line with such provisions.
It is obvious that Rivash, on the other hand, does understand Rambam to be espousing the nontraditional view that the child did not actually die. Indeed, Abarbanel begins his lengthy discussion of this brief Maimonidean passage with the assertions that:
[A]ll the commentators have stumbled and there is no help, and they have all agreed that the opinion of the Master [Rambam] was that the son of the woman of Shunem did not die… and they have also said that his opinion was that the son of the woman of Sarepta also did not die …

iTunes has always been a pain in the ass. Everyone knows it and will agree to this. Being on a jailbroken iPhone, every user will literally have sweat rolling down their brow when it comes to messing with their iPhone. I feel no differently.
My iPhone 4S had been sluggish for quite a while where Camera.app used to take about 12-15 seconds to launch (If I was lucky in case it did not crash first), Messages.app took anywhere between 12-15 seconds again.
I decided to finally restore my iPhone and it was a decision whether to do a SemiRestore or iLEX RAT. Both had their fair shares of raves and rants on Reddit and other forums. Even on YouTube, equal number of people kept recommending both of these softwares. For the ease of use, iLEX Rat seemed to be the better option of the two and I decided to take the plunge
I backed up my iPhone on iCloud and on iTunes multiple times (you can never have enough backups) and I was sure that iTunes is going to screw me over.
I installed iLEX Rat via the Cydia repo http://cydia.myrepospace.com/iLEXiNFO/ and I was in for a slight surprise. I got a UI based interaction instead of the CLI based installer. I went for the CLI based steps anyway
The famous option 12 was what I chose and it did it’s magic and asked me to reboot to go back to ‘stock’, which again, did not fail me.
This is where the pain started. After rebooting, I got the Set Up Your iPhone screen and I went through the steps. On the last step, it asked me whether I’d like to set it up as a new iPhone, Restore from iTunes or Restore from iCloud. Realizing that my backup was ~10GB, I selected iTunes. I connected my iPhone and the process started.
Halfway in the restoration process, the progress bar seemed to be stuck and it was such for at least an hour. Tried changing USB cords, ports, rebooting, updating iTunes, etc. Nothing helped.
Finally, the last option was to restore from iCloud. So once I was in the phone in the above steps, I turned off Photostream (which takes the maximum amount of time for your iPhone to be restored) from Settings.app.
iLEX Rat does what it says: Bring you back to Jailbroken Stock mode. However, you will still feel the pain that iTunes causes and you are better off with restoring from iCloud. This is how you restore iTunes backup on to your jailbroken iPhone or iPod
Last night Bernice Burgos was in Boston turning the party on at passport Saturdays. Check out the video that she posted on her social media account featuring herself and her fans from the party getting all excited!
‘Boston!! You guys always show me so much love?❤️ thank you for having me tonight !’she captioned the video that was showing her heating up the atmosphere at the party.
Her fans began praising the young grandma and telling her that she’s gorgeous. On the other hand, not all her fans are thrilled with Bernice’s activity anymore.
For instance one follower posted that ‘She gets paid to turn the party up the party do not get started until she’s arrived she is the head, and one of the highest paid I don’t really know what’s the name of what she really do I know what she does but I can’t give it a title I will say she’s a club turn up model no no no that doesn’t sound right.’
The same commenter continued saying that ‘I’m quite sure she gets calls booked the most out of anyone else probably more than celebrities rappers and singers if not more just right beside them right up there with them because the name Bernice Burgos is a brand now looks like all the rest.’
A day before this she posted a picture showing the event that she attended and invited everyone to join it!
‘Tonight BOSTON❗️We lit TONIGHT? I need all Boston Baddies to come turn up with me. Fellas, I need you all in the BUILDING too,’ Bernice captioned the photo advertising the Boston party.
Just recently her daughter, Ashely Burgos, debuted her baby bump and she posted a picture of herself on her social media account. Naturally, fans were thrilled, and they absolutely loved her pregnant look.
Rob Gronkowski and his family are raging through New England — hitting up 3 children’s hospitals in less than 24 hours … in a mission to give away a TON of cash!!
Rob — along with his bro Dan and father Gordie — decided today would be the day they distributed the $75,000 they raised by raffling off tickets to the Super Bowl.
The donation spree started off at Boston Children’s Hospital — where the Gronks played games with the kids and then presented a big, ol $25,000 check!!!
Dan tells TMZ Sports the family is en route to Barbara Bush Children’s Hospital in Portland, Maine — followed by Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Rhode Island.
The Gronks raised the money through their Gronk Nation Youth Foundation — which has a great relationship with all three hospitals.
When you’re getting ready to sell your home, it’s easy to get carried away in those excitement of trying – get it in its best condition before this task hits the market. However, before you get aroused up in the “fix-up and upgrade” excitement, really wise to first be aware of the everything you can change information on your home and the ones over which you acquire no control. Here ‘re a few ideas dealing with things you can charge and those things shoppers can’t.
First, let’s have a look at the important things you can’t change, no matter strategies about how much you’d reminiscent of to. You’ve heard the old maxime that the significance of a resources depends upon working out things: location, location, location. Well, it’s true, but the same as it or not, your home happens to be where it is, and you in a position to change that.
The next two things are from a commercial perspective changeable, but in case that you’re looking to make the the majority of possible money on the sale linked to your house, families don’t want so that you change them. I appreciate talking about your style and dimensions of your family. Both of the factors would selling price large sums in money to change, and the in all likelihood are that in the case you were open to spend your much money that would make the indispensable changes, you’d plainly go ahead and remodel your home instead of offering up it.
You also simply cannot change your property’s proximity to variety of services or buying things centers. Although potential may consider these factors when wanting at your home, they’re not a little something you can turnaround. If you’re when it comes to doubt, refer all over again to the paragraph on “location.”
The next concern you can’t decrease is the superior quality of the schools of pediatric medicine in your corner. You can cook a difference throughout your schools close to time by helping out and working and teachers, but training centers won’t change effortlessly the moment they decide to give your home, and whether they’re to # 1 to standard will be reflected doing the value along with desirability of your own personal home.
The last thing over which you will have no take care of is your family. You have not for choice about who lives to the type of left and most appropriate of your home, or about the neighborhood as a major whole.
On the another hand, there are some relatively really things you will probably control to enhance your chance of a quick conversion. Get your non commercial ready to deal in with these tips:
* Spruce up each interior as exterior associated with your home, cleaning and thus painting even necessary.
* Selling price tag to be sold. Make absoluetly certain your property’s price is within the parameters along with the geographic area by getting competitive niche market analyses from several legitimate estate agents.
There could be some issues you can easily do and simply others a can’t when getting ready to to offer up your home, but if you spot the difference, you certainly won’t spend any great deal of profit to improve your most likely used of outcomes. Preparing your entire home of sale uses work, not a bunch of finance. Get compensation for the work training your home based when you’ll sell your home.

Chiropractic is a form of alternative medicine mostly concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of mechanical disorders of the musculoskeletal system, especially the spine.[1][2] Proponents claim that such disorders affect general health via the nervous system,[2] through vertebral subluxation, claims which are demonstrably false. The main chiropractic treatment technique involves manual therapy, especially spinal manipulation therapy (SMT), manipulations of other joints and soft tissues.[3] Its foundation is at odds with mainstream medicine, and chiropractic is sustained by pseudoscientific ideas such as subluxation and "innate intelligence" that reject science.[4][5][6][7][8] Chiropractors are not medical doctors.[9]
One of the most common concerns about the neck that is not especially worrisome: signs of “wear and tear” on the cervical spine, arthritis, and degenerative disc disease, as revealed by x-ray, CT scans, and MRI. Many people who have clear signs of arthritic degeneration in their spines will never have any symptoms, or only minor, and/or not for a long time.10 For instance, about 50% of fortysomethings have clinically silent disk bulges, and even at age 20 there’s a surprising amount of spinal arthritis. The seriousness of these signs is routinely overestimated by patients and healthcare professionals alike.11
In this video Dr. Justin Bryant discusses neck pain. He talks about the various muscles and ligaments connected to the neck and the numerous causes of neck pain. Dr. Bryant also explains why Airrosti’s approach to treating neck pain differs from traditional healthcare. At Airrosti we treat the issue directly at the source to eliminate pain quickly. Learn more about what to expect at your first Airrosti visit.
The treatment of soft tissue neck and shoulder pain often includes the use of anti-inflammatory medication such as ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve or Naprosyn). Pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) may also be recommended. Depending on the source of pain, drugs like muscle relaxers and even antidepressants might be helpful. Pain also may be treated with a local application of moist heat or ice. Local corticosteroid injections are often helpful for arthritis of the shoulder. For both neck and shoulder pain movement, exercises may help. For cases in which nerve roots or the spinal cord are involved, surgical procedures may be necessary. Your doctor can tell you which is the best course of treatment for you.
Headache. A 2011 systematic review found evidence that suggests that chiropractic SMT might be as effective as propranolol or topiramate in the prevention of migraine headaches.[110] A 2011 systematic review found evidence that does not support the use of SM for the treatment of migraine headaches.[111] A 2006 review found no rigorous evidence supporting SM or other manual therapies for tension headache.[112] A 2005 review found that the evidence was weak for effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation for tension headache, and that it was probably more effective for tension headache than for migraine.[113] A 2004 Cochrane review found evidence that suggests SM may be effective for migraine, tension headache and cervicogenic headache.[114]
The most common cause of shoulder pain and neck pain is injury to the soft tissues, including the muscles, tendons, and ligaments within these structures. There is nearly double the risk for developing neck pain for people who spend most of their day sitting at work. Neck pain is twice as likely for those sitting in poor posture with the head in a flexed forward position.
Chiropractic has seen considerable controversy and criticism.[25][26] Although D.D. and B.J. were "straight" and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called "mixers", advocated the use of instruments.[23] In 1910, B.J. changed course and endorsed X-rays as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students.[23] The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.[23] That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights. By the 1930s, chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.[23]
Many other procedures are used by chiropractors for treating the spine, other joints and tissues, and general health issues. The following procedures were received by more than one-third of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey: Diversified technique (full-spine manipulation; mentioned in previous paragraph), physical fitness/exercise promotion, corrective or therapeutic exercise, ergonomic/postural advice, self-care strategies, activities of daily living, changing risky/unhealthy behaviors, nutritional/dietary recommendations, relaxation/stress reduction recommendations, ice pack/cryotherapy, extremity adjusting (also mentioned in previous paragraph), trigger point therapy, and disease prevention/early screening advice.[73]
I lost my insurance last month because I switched jobs and my new employer does not offer insurance. Can I just get small look at my shoulder joints that I sprained 3 years ago. For cheap please. I don’t make much. It is a 3rd degree joint sprain between my left shoulder and clavicle. It has been really painful lately I’m afraid it could be getting worse.
I’ve never really considered going to a chiropractor—I’m healthy, moderately active and I don’t really have much pain on a regular basis. But I work for a health and wellness company that encourages its employees to take an active role in their health, and many of my coworkers swear by their chiropractors. I wasn’t sure what a chiropractor could really do for me, but after a bit of word-of-mouth research, I found out that chiropractic care actually has benefits for your whole body! So I decided to give it a try.

I came across one of these on some website or another a while back and didn't really understand it, but I did some poking around online and the ribbon-tag blankie became my newest obsession. (I guess this kind of object is just something very tactile to occupy a baby -- the different textures and colours are fun and stimulating. Seems like a good idea.) This one, for example, is just so sweet. Some are smaller, like these ones. (And this ribbon-tab "monster doll" is inspired and awesome.) I had to make one of these little blankies, too. So I had a look at the instructions on the Craftzine.com blog, bought some short lengths of ribbon to add to my own meager scraps (several in black and white, for the recommended high contrast), and did just that:
I cut 16-inch squares of a cotton print and a plain white flannel. (Lots of people favor super-soft Minky fabric, but it's too expensive for me.) I cut the ribbons at 2.5-inch to 4-inch lengths -- short enough that the baby won't get tangled up in the loops. Pressed, pinned, sewed, top-stitched, and voilà. It's very cute! I have ribbon left over, so I might make another, smaller one. Plus it was fun to make -- a very rewarding result with little effort.
Have any of you made one of these before? If so, was it a success with the baby? (And how old of a baby would dig this kind of thing? Is my friend's 14-month-old too old for one?)
Thanks for your comments on my last post. It sounds like the wrist braces at night can really help, so I may go that route. I'm going to wait another week to see if the pain lessens a bit. A real week without knitting, unlike the five days that have passed since I got the bad news.
I know I should have dropped the needles immediately, but I just couldn't. I saw Dr. K on Thursday morning, and he diagnosed the carpal tunnel; I went straight from his office to the hospital for a blood test, and I had brought knitting with me for the waiting room! So, in the spirit of "new rules start tomorrow," I cast on and knit most of a Foolproof Baby Hat (from the Knitter's Book of Yarn) while waiting. (It was quite a wait: 45 minutes for my number to be called at reception, and then I had to drink glucose, wait one hour [plus 15 minutes because the technician was having lunch], and have the blood taken.)
Such a cute little hat! I'd been inspired by seeing Purlewe's version on Ravelry. My version (like Anj's) came out just as cute as could be. It's tiny, but the mistake rib makes it super stretchy. The yarn is Mountain Colors 4/8's Wool.
Besides this wee hat, I had a baby cardigan on the go that was one sleeve away from finished, so I couldn't very well just leave that, could I? So there was a little more knitting there. But I've definitely set aside the blanket I was working on: linen stitch with a double strand of fingering-weight wool. Definitely too hard on the hands.
So I really need to stop knitting now. It's really hard -- knitting is what I do when I watch TV at the end of the day. Last night I went to bed with a book at 8:30 p.m. because I couldn't really think of anything else to do. I can use my sewing machine, but not if I want to watch TV or hang out with Bill (because it's in my office). But I really don't want to mess up my hands more than they already are messed up, since I have a lot of work to do, so wish me luck! I've had to quit things before that I enjoyed. And it's only temporary. Maybe I should just take the extra evening time I'll have and use it to keep working on my thesis. I think my hands are going to hurt either way; if my hands hurt but my thesis is finished, I'll take that.
First of all, please imagine my "Nooooo" in that slowed-down, cinematic way -- like when, in a movie, something precious is falling and someone dives to catch it, all in slow motion, shouting in that low, distorted voice. Thank you. That will be sufficiently dramatic.
I saw my doctor this morning and told him that for the last three or four days I've woken up with stiff, numb hands, and that some swelling and stiffness persists throughout the day. He said this is (pregnancy-related) carpal tunnel syndrome, and that to keep it from getting worse, I need to stop doing anything repetitive with my hands -- like typing and knitting.
Now, I have to admit that normally, I might not actually stop knitting. I might tell my doctor I will stop knitting, and then keep knitting. But he said I should stop knitting and typing. And there's no way I can stop typing, unless my supervisor will accept a five-hour thesis on tape. Stopping typing is simply out of the question, which means I'm going to have to sacrifice knitting in the interests of getting my work done.
It had occurred to me at that at some point in this pregnancy, something might go wrong with my health that would lead to bed rest. I figured that would be bad, but I could still have my laptop and knit. But "don't use your hands"? I hadn't anticipated this one, and I think it's worse -- for me, anyway. (It's funny -- I've never thought of myself as a person who works with her hands, but I am. Bed rest would be devastating for an athlete, or a bike courier, or the mother of a toddler, but "don't use your hands" is worse for someone who spends most of her time sitting and typing and reading and making stuff.) (And I know this carpal tunnel thing is quite common in pregnancy, and the doctor said if I was at 37 weeks it wouldn't really matter. But since I'm only at 27 weeks, there's plenty of time for it to get a lot worse. The word "splints" was mentioned.)
As I clicked "publish" on that last post, I gave myself a little pep talk about how blogging probably wouldn't be like it used to be after all this time -- it might take a while for people to notice me again, etc. And when I checked back the next day and saw "0 comments," I was OK with that. And then a few hours later (thinking, "Really? Not even one?"), I remembered that I have to approve comments before they appear. And lo and behold, more than 40 lovely notes were waiting for me in comment-modification limbo, making me feel very happy and humbled. I thank each of you from the bottom of my heart. Welcome back to you, too.
And thanks for the burp cloth comments! I'd like to make more that involve simply adding a fabric trim to cloth diapers, or with flannel over one whole side. (Where does one even buy cloth diapers these days? Zellers? Do I have to go to Walmart?) I'm spending most of my time this week polishing off a couple of draft chapters, but I have a second flannel receiving blanket on the go, too, so I can take a break from writing and just roll my chair a few feet over to my sewing table. So far, I've cut the fabric and pressed/pinned the hem around it. At some point this afternoon, I'll do that sewing. From my googling, I see that lots of people sew double-layered receiving blankets, but I'm just using a single layer. A 40-inch-square piece of flannel is big, and I think getting two pieces to match exactly in size -- and to sew them together perfectly so that the blanket lies flat -- would just be needlessly frustrating. I'd rather make a pile of single-layer blankets and just use two if the extra warmth is needed. I'm all about layers. It's because I started dressing myself in the '80s.
So life is all about flannel and writing these days. As for other baby stuff, we're slowly amassing the things we'll need. I've bought plenty of baby clothes secondhand (PLENTY); I scored a Boppy pillow (with a dinosaur-patterned slipcover) on eBay; and my best friend found a really good carseat at a yard sale last weekend. I've signed up for prenatal classes, which don't start until October, and I've put the baby's name (i.e., "Baby") on the city's central daycare waiting list. (Quebec is good to babies, offering things like subsidized daycare, because they need more of them -- but the waiting list is long.) I'm 26 weeks pregnant today. It feels to me like I'm right in the middle of "we've still got lots of time" and "not too much longer now." It's a nice place to be.
ETA: Funny -- I just noticed that the last photo I posted of Mooky was almost exactly one year ago. That's a long time without Mooky! I apologize! (It obviously wasn't so hot at this time last year, or he never would have been sleeping in the house.)

Asa WINSTANLEY: "Israel's 'war' against BDS is increasingly desperate" (MEMo, Jan 18, 2016): click here!
At first ignored, and later derided, the BDS movement has by now become one of the top strategic threats to Israel's ability carry on the business of occupation as usual.
It is beginning to seem as if the arrival of winter spells academic boycott season as well as the festive season. This year in November, the business meetings of two major associations voted overwhelmingly to endorse the call of Palestine civil society to engage in a boycott of Israeli academic institutions until such times as they—and the state with which they are so deeply intertwined—respect the internationally recognized human rights of Palestinians.

This is the first time a major church pension fund has acted to preclude investment in Israeli banks that sustain Israel’s illegal occupation of Palestinian land.

Aziza NOFAL: "Why Palestinian housewives are taking lead in boycott campaigns" (Al-Monitor, Jan 8, 2016): click here!
BDS campaign coordinator and Palestinian politician Majida al-Masri told Al-Monitor, “This campaign is unique in that it addresses housewives in their capacity as those in charge of household spending and the best suited to make decisions related to buying products. As the campaign developed, it garnered the membership of all women’s groups and organizations that are active in the West Bank, subsequently spreading to Gaza, thus empowering and driving it forward.”
Members of the American Historical Association on Saturday voted down, 111 to 51, a resolution “upholding the rights of Palestinian faculty and students to pursue their education and research freely” and committing the AHA to “monitoring Israeli actions restricting the right to education in the occupied Palestinian territories,” among other points. The vote came at the association's annual meeting here.

The United Nations' Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination points out with alarm that Israel maintains two separate educational systems for its citizens — one for Jewish children and another for the children of the Palestinian minority — a structure that reinforces the profound segregation of Israeli society in everything from matters of citizenship and marriage to housing rights.
French telecoms giant Orange has announced the termination of its franchise relationship with Israeli company Partner Communications, confirming the BDS movement’s announcement last year that this was likely to happen.
Recent Israeli efforts to fight BDS smell of deep despair, which is giving rise to hopeless aggression, even worse bullying and patently irrational measures that can only help BDS to grow in the coming few years.
On December 15, 2015, the United Auto Workers (UAW) International Executive Board (IEB) nullified the resolution passed last year by members of UAW Local 2865, the 13,000 teaching assistants and student-workers at the University of California system, that called on the International to endorse the Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel by withholding their financial investments in companies “complicit in severe and ongoing human rights violations as part of the Israeli oppression of the Palestinian people."
MLA (Modern Language Association) Members for Justice in Palestine is a group within the MLA Commons that was established in 2014 and submitted a Resolution Endorsing the Boycott of Israeli Academic institutions to the Organizing Committee of the Delegate Assembly for consideration at the 2015 Delegate Assembly meeting. The vote on the Resolution was postponed until the 2017 MLA Convention allowing for further debate and discussion of the issue with the aim of educating the membership. The organizers and supporters are scholars at all levels within the academy working in a various fields of language and literary studies. [The Open Letter can be signed online.]

Yes, baby food maker Beech-Nut has issued a recall on 2,000 pounds of baby food because there is reason to believe they contain pieces of glass. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), "using the product will cause serious health consequences or death," making the recall a Class I priority.
The product that was recalled was Beech-Nut CLASSICS sweet potato & chicken. The jars were distributed across the nation. Here is what to look for on the jars:
Jars that have the number “P-68A” inside the USDA mark of inspection, with an expiration date of December, 2016
Fortunately, no one has been injured due to the contaminated jars. Only one report has been found so far with a jar containing a small piece of glass.
According to Beech-Nut, consumers who have jars with these product numbers should call the company at (866) 674-4446 to get a full refund, or return the products to the store where they purchased them.
During my first job as a nurse’s aide in a nursing home, I found out a few surprising things. I had the usual, lowly job of cleaning up after patients, feeding them, walking them and bathing them. I had learned in my first year of nursing school to treat people respectfully, and call them by their real names. I quickly saw that on the job, things were different. The other aides, all more experienced than I was, and even the nurses in charge called the nursing home residents, “dear”, “honey”, and “sweetie” regularly. I felt puzzled by this. I noticed that some of the residents didn’t seem to care what they were called, but others did seem to be bothered by these so-called terms of endearment. The constant use of “dearie”, rather than the resident’s name was annoying, even to my 19 year old ears. Though it was part of my nursing instruction to avoid talking down to a patient, I never saw a study which demonstrated any health related reason for avoiding use of “honey” or “dear”. A recent article describes the effect of this kind of talk to elders on their perceptions of aging, and on their longevity.
In October, 2008, the New York Times reported on a study of how some elders are insulted by these names, and how the perceived insults contribute to adverse health affects. Dr. Becca Levy, the article reports, a professor of epidemiology and psychology at Yale University, studied the effects of negative attitudes toward aging communicated by other through their comments. Health care workers, in particular treat elders in a way some elders perceive as belittling. When health care workers use terms like “dear” or “sweetie”, some elders perceive this as a message that they are incompetent, or that they are being treated like a child. The 660 person survey Dr. Levy conducted over a long term, found that those who had more positive perceptions of aging lived longer. Continued messages that the elder is incompetent can lead to a negative perception of aging, and a downward spiral in self esteem, particularly with Alzheimer’s patients. These persons are struggling to maintain a sense of their personhood. The wrong message about their competence can be very upsetting. The findings held up, even when variables in health conditions were factored in. Negative perceptions of aging were equated with shorter life spans.
Healthcare workers who spend the most time with elderly residents in care facilities are the aides, not the registered nurses. Aides have less training, and sometimes no training, in how to address their aging care recipients. Although some aging persons do not object to being called “honey”, rather than being addressed by name, many object and feel insulted and talked down to. Some even consider these terms a form of bullying. Some aging persons may, on the other hand, like these terms and consider them friendly.
If you are a caregiver, what does this mean for you? If you know the person you’re caring for, have genuine affection for him or her, and you believe your resident likes a term of affection, using “dear” may be fine. However, if you aren’t sure, the best way to find out if calling someone “dear” is bothersome to him or her is to ask. “Does it bother you if I call you ‘dear’?”
If it really upsets the individual, he or she may honestly tell you. If your resident has difficulty speaking, or is perhaps shy about being open concerning feelings, take the more conservative approach. Call him or her by name. Few people are so formal as to want to be called by “Mr. Jones” or “Mrs. Smith”, but there are older persons who feel that it is disrespectful to do otherwise. “Sir” or “ma’am” are what others may be accustomed to hearing, and it could be offensive for them to be called “honey”. It is no trouble for the caregiver to simply say, “May I call you Mary?” The elder is likely to feel respected by this effort. It says you think enough of the elder to give him or her a choice about how he or she wants to be called. The caregiver can use this courtesy to establish trust right away, and build the foundation of a caring relationship.

I just don't know what to do about the estranged sister who has exploited well over $50K of my mother's savings and my Mothers admitted " lack of "will power" to say no to her."

We've heard that the Scandinavians may be practically perfect in every way. To us, this seems to be true! We love Scandinavian weddings.. Malin & Asmund's wedding was no exception.
Katrina & Lucas proved that not only summer or Christmas weddings are beautiful. Their early January snow sprinkled wedding was just magical.
Finding a location for your wedding that will wow everyone yet will make everyone feel like at home is a recipe to a perfect wedding.

Berries, apples, red balloons, candles, family and friends and amazing macaroon tower.. Jekaterina & Jevgenij wanted to have a small family wedding and their October wedding was just.. cozy!
Moeko & Jan weren’t about to have a large glamorous wedding. Instead they chose to celebrate their day in their family country house in the West Bohemia. Even on the official site of the town, Prebuz is described as „the town at the end of the world“. It’s a town with the lowest population in the Czech Republic surrounded with beautifully rough highlands. It turned out to be the perfect place for Moeko & Jan’s intimate family affair, just as they wanted it.
The history of the Mirror Chapel at Clementinum attracts couples to say their I do's. It's located in the heart of Prague just few steps from the Old Town Square and Jiqi & Yichi could not have chosen a better venue for their small family wedding.
If we had to describe Jana & Pierre’s wedding in one word, it would be sweet. Though if you have a look at the gorgeous gallery bellow, you can see it was much more than that.
We had just two months to plan Jana & Pierre’s wedding and we were thrilled about how beautifully it turned out and how happy the couple was.
