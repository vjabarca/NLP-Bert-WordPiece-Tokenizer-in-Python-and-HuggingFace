To gain more insight into why startups fail, sign up to the Autopsy Subscriber List or to help entrepreneurs by sharing your story, you can submit an Autopsy here.
Most of us never would like to see the inside of an auto body repair center. At most we can often smell the solvents being emitted by automotive body vehicle repair center even as we drive by and ask yourself how those individuals makes it through a work day never being exact and exact in both corresponding the colour of car panels and repairing car, pickup truck and S.U.V physiques after vehicle collisions.
It is merely unintentionally - automobile accidents that almost all of us end up inside the premises of our own local, supplier or a string vehicle body shop.
Most retailers now bear little relation to the establishments you might remember as a kid - dark and dusty bounded by both hemorrhoids of used and new car parts and a mean officer dog in the garden. There could be some of those still around nonetheless they are a dying breed. Mending autos now, especially with the gadgets in the current vehicles, requires both skill, education and training, advanced tools and an ultra clean, modern shop.
Modern body shops now seem to be to be uniformly clean, well organized and well lit. As well many body retailers are organized in several particular split staging areas. Vehicles are projected in a single area, body work done in another, digital repairs in yet another area, painted in an exceedingly separate area, and lastly detailed and offered to the client in a display area.
If the vehicle has major destruction, then it is transferred to a disassembly area and onto a body machine. Unibody building is utilized by most autos today. Unibody is a an motor vehicle and mechanical body term which describes how sheet steel is stamped, produced and welded jointly to create the structural portion of the automobile or pickup truck body.
The goal of the "frame machine" is not to straighten the automobile framework now - alternatively it is to straighten the unibody building of the automobile.
Measuring the vehicle body for appropriate unibody position is more than critical. As little as one millimeter mistake is all that is allowed by most car, truck and S.U.V. manufacturers. Laser measuring systems are being used by many body retailers along with the shape machine to ensure that everything is straightened effectively to the decimal point.
While using unibody of the vehicle straight, the car, pickup truck or S.U.V. steps to the metal work area where new sheet steel is attached and damage area straightened. This work continues to be done by skilled technicians and tradesmen using hammers and dollies, but even the work done by body shop technicians has been altered by modern technology. Over head vacuum lines are linked to the grinders and sanders to move dust and dirt and grime away from this part of the shop. Modern body outlets can continue to be very clean and particles free- indeed modern electronics , and even the modern hi tech gadgets of hybrid vehicles demand this.
With the entire metal straight, it's on to the paint preparation area, commonly known as "paint prep". Quality outlets will use dust particles extraction systems to eliminate the dust particles when sanding and spraying the coloring primers. Infrared light systems may be used to cure primer color quickly and properly. These infrared lighting can shorten the treatment time from 24 hours remarkably to as little as 20 minutes. Many of these procedures both enable you to get a higher quality reassured job and get you back on the highway in a minimal time span.
Painting the final colors and clear jackets is performed in a color booth. You will discover many types and brands of paint booths, nonetheless it is normally accepted the best are the "downdraft" units where fresh filtered air gets into the very best of the booth and any underspray is taken downward and out through grates in the ground. The downdraft method of color booths can produce the best and most consistent of coloring finishes. In addition a proper trained operator can make a great difference in final more info paint and appearance quality and persistence. A dust particles free paint booth of any design is preferable to a soiled and dusty color booth of the best end. Before spending your money or committing you to ultimately the work or repairs it is always best to ask to examine several examples of the shops work on several vehicles. Furthermore ask to see finished examples of a number of different body types - cars, vehicles, vans and SUVs. Search for smooth finishes with minimal dust technical specs and colors that match from panel to panel. These are the signs of a quality coloring job done by a skilled and professional painter.
It's understandable that a professional coloring shop will be pleased with their faculties- the layout, equipment, training of their staff - and the majority of almost all their people.
Such a shop must have no trouble, barring practical logistics, of allowing you a tour of these facilities. Indeed in the end with their careful efforts they should be most proud to give you a tour and point out their strong things and capacities as well as examples of their completed product.
In the end it's your automobile that has been repaired - whether it's your brand-new S.U.V, car, pick up truck, truck or bus.
"It's about beating the time clock." This estimate comes from a sensible old service administrator, advising me on how to increase my income as a flat-rate specialist. If you've ever wondered why your car doesn't get set correctly, or your entire concerns weren't resolved, you can blame, partly, the flat-rate pay framework.
Flat-rate simply means that your auto mechanic is paid a flat fee for a specific repair, regardless of how long the repair actually takes. In other words, if your vehicle needs a drinking water pump, which gives two hours of labor, and the auto mechanic completes the job in one hour, he gets payed for two.
In theory, this can work to your advantage. If the work takes longer, you still only pay the "predetermined" labor amount. THEORETICALLY, not reality!
The flat-rate pay structure is designed to drive productivity. It is rather effective. The flat-rate pay system encourages technicians to work hard and fast, but it generally does not promote quality.
In terms to getting your car fixed appropriately, the flat-rate pay structure has disastrous effects. Flat-rate technicians are constantly looking for shortcuts to conquer the clock to be able to maximize the number of hours they expenses. Experienced flat-rate technicians can costs from 16 to 50 time within an 8 hour day.
It's these shortcuts and the breakneck rate at which even rate technicians work that result in a few of the most idiotic mistakes. Within the rapid-fire pace of your shop I've observed technicians start machines with no oil. I've seen transmissions fallen, smashing into little parts onto the shop floor. And I've seen automobiles driven through bay doors--all in the name of "beating the time."
Flat-rate technicians can get quite complex with shortcuts. The best was the execution of any 6-foot-long 2-by-4, that was located under the engine unit for support while a motor unit support was removed. It made a job predetermined to adopt 1.5 hours achievable in twenty minutes. A win-win, right? The technician makes extra money; you get your vehicle back faster.
Actually, oftentimes the placement of this 2-by-4 ruined the oil pan. Moreover, it caused the car, your vehicle, to balance precariously 6 toes in the air, as the technician manipulated the car lift to access your engine support.
This tactic was abruptly discontinued when a technician's 2-by-4 snapped triggering the automobile to crash nose area down onto the concrete floor.
Sometimes the shortcuts create very delicate disturbances, which create problems overtime. An instant example: a vehicle had its transmitting serviced with a fresh filter, gasket, and substance. During the method, the technician was able to save time by twisting the transmission dipstick tube somewhat, to be able to have the transmission pan out faster. The automobile was reassembled, and the technician re-bent the pipe back to place and off it went--no concerns....
Half a year later, the vehicle returned with an intermittent misfire. The engine motor wasn't running on all cylinders. After intensive diagnostics, it was found out that the transmitting dipstick tube experienced chaffed through the engine unit harness, intermittently grounding out an injector. Hmm, that's peculiar. Don't usually see that.
The high-speed environment and the subsequent shortcuts demonstrate the devastating effects of the flat-rate, sales-driven pay framework on the grade of car repairs.
The poor quality of work prompted by the flat rate pay framework is disconcerting enough. Alas, it doesn't stop here. The negative effects of flat-rate get exponentially even worse, as it starts "wide" the entranceway to rip you off!
The majority of us never may wish to look at within a car body repair shop. At most we could usually smell the solvents being emitted by automotive body vehicle mechanic shop once we drive by and wonder how the individuals causes it to be via a work day never ever being precise and precise in both matching colour of vehicle panels and repairing automobile, truck and S.U.V bodies after car collisions.
Its only unintentionally – motor vehicle collisions that many folks wind up inside premises of our neighborhood, dealer or perhaps a sequence auto human body store.
Most shops today bear small reference to the organizations you may possibly remember being a youngster – dark and dirty surrounded by both piles of made use of and brand new car parts in addition to a suggest guard dog in garden. There may be a few of those nonetheless around however they are a dying type. Restoring cars now, specially aided by the electronics in today’s vehicles, needs both skill, training and education, sophisticated tools and an ultra clean, modern shop.
Modern body shops today be seemingly consistently clean, well-laid on and well-lit. And many body shops tend to be outlined in lot of distinct split staging areas. Vehicles are believed in a single area, human anatomy work carried out in another, electronic repair works in still another area, painted really split area, last but not least detail by detail and presented into the client in a screen area.
In the event that car has actually major harm, then it is relocated to a disassembly area and onto a frame device. Unibody construction is used by most autos these days. Unibody is a an automotive and technical body term which describes exactly how sheet metal is stamped, created and welded collectively to form the architectural portion of the vehicle or vehicle body.
The goal of the “frame device” isn't to straighten the automobile framework today – rather it really is to straighten the unibody building of automobile.
Measuring the vehicle human body for proper unibody positioning is much more than critical. Less than one millimeter mistake is perhaps all that is allowed by most car, truck and S.U.V. producers. Laser calculating methods are employed by many people human anatomy stores combined with the frame machine to ensure everything is straightened accurately toward decimal point.
With all the unibody associated with the car directly, the vehicle, truck or S.U.V. moves towards steel work area where brand-new sheet metal is attached and harms location straightened. This work is nonetheless done-by competent specialists and tradesmen using hammers and dollies, but even the work done-by human body shop technicians has been altered by contemporary technologies. Overhead vacuum outlines tend to be connected to the grinders and sanders to pull dirt and soil away from this part of the store. Modern human anatomy stores can stay extremely neat and dust free- undoubtedly contemporary electronic devices , and also more modern hi tech electronic devices of hybrid automobiles need this.
Utilizing the entire material straight, it's to the paint planning area, frequently referred to as “paint prep”. High quality stores will use dirt removal systems to get rid of the dirt when sanding and spraying the paint primers. Infrared illumination methods may be used to cure primer paint rapidly and properly. These infrared lights can shorten the treatment time from 24 hours remarkably to less than 20 mins. Most of these processes both help you to get a high quality ensured work and get you back traveling within a minimal span of time.
Painting the last colors and obvious coats is done in a paint booth. There are many types and labels of paint booths, nevertheless it is typically acknowledged the best would be the “downdraft” devices where fresh filtered air goes into the top of the booth and any underspray is pulled downward and away through grates in the flooring. The downdraft treatment of paint stands can produce ideal and a lot of consistent of paint finishes. Also a well trained operator can certainly create a great difference in final paint and look high quality and consistency. A dust no-cost paint booth of any design is better than a dirty and dirty paint booth of the greatest end. Before spending your money or committing you to ultimately the task or repairs it will always be far better ask to examine a number of samples of the shops work on a few vehicles. In addition ask to see done examples of various human body kinds – cars, vehicles, vans and SUVs. Seek out smooth finishes with minimal dust specifications and colors that match from panel to panel. They are the signs of an excellent paint work done by an experienced and expert painter.
It's obvious that a professional paint store is likely to be proud of their traits- the design, equipment, training of the staff – & most of most their individuals.
That store must have no trouble, barring practical logistics, of enabling you a tour of the facilities. Certainly all things considered of the cautious attempts they should be most happy to provide you with a tour and mention their strong things and abilities also samples of their particular finished item.
All things considered it is your automobile that's being fixed – if it is your S.U.V, vehicle, truck, van or coach.

Hello! Thanks for stopping by and I hope all is good in your little part of the world. I've been having a wonderful time as it's been school hols here so three weeks of no early mornings, lazy days at home and lots of knitting time! We go back on Monday but I'm trying not to think about that too much....
I finally finished the "redo" sweater that I was reknitting and it came out rather well. Want to see?
(Excuse the quality of the pics but my Mum took them on a cloudy day. The wearer was busy with building work and was less than impressed about stopping to model it!)
I was very happy with the result although it's a little short in the sleeves. This will be remedied by picking up stitches around the cuffs and knitting another inch or so. The join won't show once its washed. I've done that a couple of times before and it works like a charm!
Just LOVE that cable! It's a new one that I've never tried before and whilst it was a bit fiddly to do in the beginning, I soon got the hang of it. I love the contrast between the simple moss stitch panel down the centre and then that huge chunky cable! Gorgeous!
What else, I hear you say? Well, I made a little shawl/scarf for a friend of mine. She loves pink so when I saw this yarn I knew it was perfect for her. The pattern is Linus and this is the second one I've made now. The first you can see here.
I love the simplicity of this pattern which lends itself well to fancy yarns. I've seen it made up in sock yarns, self-striping yarn and various tonal yarns. It's easy, very quick (I made this in 2 evenings) and is a great stashbuster project. Because it's knitted end-to-end you can just keep going until you run out of yarn which is fab for me as I'm not very good and working out how much yarn I have! I really hope she likes it....
Then I started a project which I am VERY excited about. Let me first give you a little bit of background so you understand the reason behind my enthusiasm.
Here in South Africa there is very little choice when it comes to yarn. Almost all of the stuff you buy in the shops is 100% acrylic and whilst this is fine for most projects, sometimes I crave something a little more special. I see all the blogs of my UK and American friends where they show the most amazing yarns that they can get at their LYS but it's all just too expensive for me to even think about importing.
A few local companies are cropping up now with some locally produced yarns for example Nurturing Fibres, African Expressions and Vinnis but we have nothing like the variety that my overseas friends have.
However. For a long time I have coveted a yarn from African Expressions called Soul which is handpainted and I finally took the plunge these hols and acquired some! So exciting! It lay in my drawer for a few days and I kept looking at it and touching it and then going on Ravelry to choose a pattern, then going back to look at it again ..... I'm sure you know what I mean. You so desperately want to cast on but the anticipation is all part of the process.....
I finally decided on Over The Sea to Skye which I have to confess, I chose largely because of the name!!! I cast on yesterday and this is my progress so far -
The yarn is made up of 15% kid mohair, 15% mulberry silk, 50% merino and 20% acrylic. It's beautiful to work with and with all the stitch variations, I'm able to see how it responds with each one. I can't tell you how much I've loving this project and I know I'll buy this yarn again (even if it means remortgaging my house to do so)! I will need to invest in a ball winder tho as I had to wind this by hand which wasn't easy. This was how it started out ....
All those yummy colours! They do various other colourways but I know I'll never make socks with this yarn as it's just too gorgeous to be hidden inside shoes!
I'm off to knit (of course) and will hopefully finish my shawl before going back to school on Monday!

The defendant (appellant) is, and during the year 1910 was, engaged at Verdi in an extensive general business of sawing and manufacturing lumber and forest products. In April of that year one Eric Erickson entered into a written contract to haul the lumber sawed by appellant in its mills at Verdi from its trimmer to its yards, and there to pile the lumber, at the price of 80 cents per thousand feet, without help or assistance furnished by, or other expense to, the appellant. The contract did not mention cars, track, or appliances or provide that the defendant should furnish Erickson with any instrumentalities for moving the lumber. It was taken from the trimmer and loaded in the mill and hauled on the cars and track of appellant to the yard, where it was piled. The track was in place apparently for the purpose of hauling the lumber; and, although it was not mentioned in the written agreement, it may be implied that it was to be furnished by appellant, and that it was to be used by Erickson in moving the lumber for appellant's benefit, instead of a team or other track to be constructed by him.
While plaintiff was in the employment of Erickson and partners, and engaged in driving a horse drawing a car of lumber from the trimmer to the yard, over the track,
and while he was standing on a space about one foot wide at the side of the lumber, and holding the lines with one hand and the brake stick with the other, the car went down on one side, the load of lumber slipped from the car, crushed his right leg, and bruised his back and left arm.
In the complaint it is alleged that plaintiff was otherwise injured, wounded and cut, and became sick, sore, lame, disordered, and will so remain during the rest of his life, and that he expended the sum of $690 for medical attention, hospital accommodations, and nursing in attempting to cure himself of the injuries. He asked for damages in the sum of $15,000. By the verdict the jury allowed $3,000.
There was testimony that the lumber was 16 feet long, the car about 6 feet in length and 5 feet wide, and that the load of lumber was piled about 5 feet wide and extended over the ends of the car. The plaintiff testified:
A. I took that car at the mill and pushed it onto that track where the car it is supposed to go, and about three blocks from that mill, where the ties were torn and broken there. I didn't notice it; the rail sank down. I did not have time to get away, and I standing there, and no chance to get away whatever. * * * I hit the spot; I didn't see anything; it was dark. I went down, and I tried to get away. I didn't have time; there was no chance to get away.
Q. Explain, as you drove along, what occurred to the car and the load of lumber. A. It sunk down to one side, that side I was standing on.
[1] It is claimed that the appellant is not liable because plaintiff was not in the employment of appellant, but was in the exclusive employment of an independent contractor, and that there was an assumption of risk and contributory negligence on his part. We conclude that, under the circumstances indicated, these contentions cannot avail the appellant. The instances in which the owners of property become liable to parties injured who have
no contractual relations are very numerous. Liability for accidents resulting from defective sidewalks or excavations carelessly left open or unguarded are illustrations. If the plaintiff had been a mere trespasser, or had been working for some one using the track who had no business relation with the appellant, different questions would arise. It may assumed that the jury properly concluded that under the conditions and custom there it was intended that the company should furnish the track and that the use of it by the plaintiff as an employee of Erickson was with the consent and for the business and benefit of the appellant. We regard the case on principle ...

Six suspects are expected in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate’s Court on Thursday after they were bust by the Port Elizabeth Flying Squad while still hatching out their plan for a business robbery.
On Monday, at about 16:00, members from the Flying Squad, W/O Hein Steenkamp, Constables Rayno Te Brugge, Michael Williams, Ludi Retief and Ustinov Fischer, followed up on information received about a possible business robbery being planned at a shop in Sidwell.
“The members spotted the suspected vehicle and closed in on them, leaving no room for escape. Six suspects, aged between 25 and 32 years old, were arrested,” police said.
“The suspects were detained for unlawful possession of unlicensed firearms and unlawful possession of unlicensed ammunition.
It was further established that three of the suspects have pending cases of robbery and vehicle hijackings against them.
In another police success; on Tuesday, at about 14:00, the same members were involved in the arrest of a 31 year-old man for being in possession of mandrax tablets.
“It is alleged that the members were patrolling in Commercial Road, Sidwell, when they observed a suspected drug deal taking place in the street.
“A plastic bag of 100 tablets of mandrax was found on him. The estimated street value is R10 000. A substantial amount of cash was also confiscated.”
“Drugs and substance abuse contributes enormously to the commission of various crimes, including serious and violent crimes. Therefore, the police will continue to crack down on these drug dealers,” the police said.
“The police officers are commended for their swift response and arrests. We encourage the community to continue to provide information on any suspicious activity that is taking place in their areas. In order to eradicate criminal elements it is essential that communities join hands with the police.”
The Mena School Board is prepared to move ahead on a couple of major projects that are upcoming for the district. In their March monthly meeting, the school board signed an easement for the North Morgan Street roadway agreement, contingent upon the State Highway Commission’s plans.
Although an exact start date is not set for the construction of the new roadway that is hoped will alleviate traffic coming in and out of Holly Harshman Elementary, bids will be let out on May 31, 2017. Work is expected to begin within 45 days of bid approval. That pushes the dates out to around July 2017, with the completion date coming before the beginning of the 2017-2018 school year. The street will run from Highway 71, near Sun Country Inn, to Holly Harshman.
Another major project that is steaming ahead is the expansion of Louise Durham Elementary. “I’m glad to say, at this point, everything is coming together in our budget,” said District Superintendent Benny Weston. He expects documentation to be complete by mid-April, and the bidding process will begin. Once the documents and bids are approved, the contract price on the large expansion will be provided to the school board with construction start dates to follow.
The $8 million renovation/expansion of Louise Durham Elementary will include a systems upgrade and the addition of approximately 16,000 square feet to the existing building, including approximately 14 classrooms, a new office area, and a large bathroom being built near the existing front entrance. The current renderings of the proposed project show a new exterior design that will match closely with Mena High School, keeping the same color schemes and large façade. The addition will see an end to modular units now in use and all students will be housed in the main building that will accommodate up to 600 students. Student drop-off and pick-up areas will change slightly when the project is completed.
The systems upgrade portion is a $2.4 million project. Mena Public Schools will be responsible for only half of that cost, $1.2 million, because the district seized the opportunity to secure a matching grant from the Arkansas Division of Public School Academic Facilities and Transportation, which will pay the remaining $1.2 million. Mena’s portion will come from their building fund. The renovation and expansion of the facility will cost approximately $5.6 million and will be paid for through the district’s building fund and bond extension.

The 19-year-old, who will take the No.29 shirt, joins the Reds following the expiration of his contract with Chelsea.
Solanke has put the finishing touches to his switch to Anfield in time to join the early stages of preparations for the 2017-18 campaign.
“Even just pulling on the training top, I was over the moon. Hopefully I can put on the shirt in the near future and make some good history here.”
Solanke joins the Reds fresh from scoring four goals in England U20s’ successful World Cup campaign this summer.
Baring in mind that Mesut Ozil has been frequently criticized in recent times and the primary criticism of Ozil is that he does not do enough to seize control of games, and he lacks hunger and drive, it was a cruel twist of fate that it was his inability to finish a golden opportunity that swung this match away from Arsenal.
The German midfielder was clean through on goal, with almost enough time to stop and brush the hair out of his eyes, Ozil had the most welcoming of opportunities to extend the lead given to his side by an unlikely Per Mertesacker header in the first half of the game.
He fluffed it, Heurelho Gomes saved, and barely a minute later Watford was awarded a controversial penalty which Troy Deeney converted. Not long after that, the ball fell invitingly to Tom Cleverley and Arsenal had magicked three points into none.
Ozil’s omission in the starting line up was an indication of Wenger’s reluctance to change his winning formula and also possibly rely less on him and Alexis as its becoming clearer that they will be on their way out of the club by January. Since the 4-0 humbling at Liverpool, Arsenal have won five out of their last six matches, with Ozil playing in just seven minutes of those games.
The most notable change in Arsene Wenger’s side was the return of Mertesacker to the heart of the defence. Although he has played in other competitions, with a man-of-the-match performance in the FA Cup final last season, the German had not started a Premier League game for 532 days before this.
The first real chance fell to Watford. Abdoulaye Doucoure twisted his way down the left wing and flashed a cross for Roberto Pereyra, who could not quite contort himself and glance his close-range header home.
Still, this was encouraging for Silva, who refused to give his players a moment of peace from the touchline as he cajoled and clapped and nagged his way through the first half.
His most dangerous player, as has been the case for much of this season, was the direct Richarlison on the left, who nearly burst into Arsenal box but was thwarted by a fine challenge from Hector Bellerin.
Then Mertesacker ambled up for Granit Xhaka’s corner, held off the helpless Cleverley a curious choice to mark the 6ft 6in German and powered his header home for a goal that was scarcely deserved but ruthlessly finished.
Now the Arsenal machine was whirring, and Bellerin missed the target when he should have made it two before the break.
Watford’s half-time instructions seemed to be to move further up the pitch. Richarlison soon had their first effort, cutting in but curling wide, but the more aggressive approach almost immediately left holes at the back.
Iwobi, in particular, took pleasure from raiding those spaces, and both he and Welbeck could have been clean through if it Lacazette had not botched the final pass. It was enough to prompt a change of shape from Silva, who threw Deeney into the fray after an hour.
Ozil then had his big moment, and choked. Richarlison was almost immediately sent flying in the box, and Deeney stepped up to make it 1-1.
Watford had plenty of chances to win it before they finally did. Etienne Capoue’s deflected effort spun against the post and then Richarlison volleyed over from close range.
The golden moment eventually arrived following a goal mouth scramble that was finally, emphatically, finished by Cleverley.
Under both Walter Mazzarri and and Quique Sánchez Flores, Watford had spells of good form before falling away, ultimately costing both managers their jobs.
But this current crop looks better than any other side over the past two seasons. Marco Silva has them well-organised at both ends of the pitch their focus should certainly be on a top half finish rather than avoiding the drop.

to what extent did each of the following play in the development of industrialization of the america
Factors contributing to this include the lack of relevance of some questions to aboriginal people in remote areas following traditional life styles, particular sensitivity of some topics in aboriginal society, and language difficulties (abs 1991. Australian aboriginal peoples, one of the two distinct groups of indigenous peoples of australia, the other being the torres strait islander peoples fish-trapping fence fish-trapping fence in north-central arnhem land, northern territory, australia.

Nationalism in australia, being australian, becoming australian, sose: history, year 10, vic introduction nationalism in australia is believed to have emerged within the society of emancipists during the early 19th century. Indigenous overrepresentation in prisons factors that contribute to indigenous overrepresentation the notion of a treaty in australia: an indigenous.
Cases of oppression are very much present within our world's history, and even in most societies today being rich in history, australia is a large example of oppression in our world. Aboriginal people are still rebounding from an era of discrimination and oppression furthermore, many residents in australia are feeling the negative effects of the r eduction of social welfare payments such as newstart, the parenting payment, and the disability support pension. Britain continued to expand by colonizing countries such as new zealand and australia, both of which were not empty land as they had their own locals and cultures [12] : 175 britain's nationalistic movements were evident with the creation of the commonwealth countries where there was a shared nature of national identity.
Family violence in aboriginal communities factors contributing to the high levels and oppression violence against aboriginal women includes many forms. Given the great disparity in wealth, income, health, housing, incarceration rates and age of death of indigenous and non-indigenous australians, to treat indigenous and non-indigenous people equally would not be justice. The other fundamental aspect of women's oppression in capitalist society and one that has roots in earlier systems, is the lack of democratic rights this affects women of all classes in social systems, such as slavery arid feudalism, the mass of people had no democratic rights and were in fact owned to a great extent by other humans. The very ink with which all history is written is merely fluid prejudice mark twain since the european invasion of australia in 1788, the aboriginal people have been oppressed into a world unnatural to their existence for thousands of years.

In 1967 australia voted in a landmark referendum to finally include aboriginal and torres strait islanders in its census but, as paul daley reports, the fight for genuine equality is far from over. These factors interact in complex ways and contribute to the over-representation of aboriginal people in the criminal justice system 1 consequently, addressing over-representation requires systemic, community, family and individually focused responses. In addition, the children resulting from relationships between indigenous and non-indigenous australians often identify as indigenous, accelerating the growth of the indigenous population. The evidence of oppression against the aboriginals has existed since the seven-year war in 1760's within north america it first started when the british feared the aboriginal population would fight for independence, which would throw the british out of north america.
An underpinning belief of the sacred site program is that indigenous peoples' unresolved grief is a major contributing factor to the range of social and health issues which exist in indigenous communities today. Introduction this section outlines what the literature says about causal factors of family violence and child abuse in aboriginal communities while the broader literature on the causes of family violence outside aboriginal families is not reviewed in detail here, it should be noted that there are strong parallels between the two bodies of literature.

Wow, Vendlus records has yet another positive surprise for me in stock. I have not heard of V:28 from Norway before, which is kind of a pity if you take into account that they just have split up. A consequent move – “VioLution” is the last part of a trilogy V:28 were unleashing about nothing less than the end of the world, and as they have stated that this trilogy was the whole point of V:28 it seems that with this goal achieved they have no more to add.
On to the music: A kind of atmospheric intro erupts into the first real song, “Shut It Down”. And how they shut it down lets me rejoice; blastbeats right into your face, killer riffs and belligerent vocals. Some calm parts show what V:28 are also capable of, and the next song, “The Absolute”, combines this even better. At this point I ask myself why the unholy hell V:28 do claim to play Death Metal – This song is an orgasmic mix of the best bands USBM has to offer; reminiscences to LEVIATHAN, XASTHUR and KROHM are no exaggerations, and the calm middle part with Garm’s (yeah, there he goes again) yet again flawless performance preparing for the climax makes one hell of a song. Definitively a must hear. “Pattern Of The Weak” is more on the shredded side of metal with some industrial influences, and “Surrender To Oblivion”, “World Wide Bombing Day” and “Desert Generator” scream KROHM again so loud that it is hard to believe that these guys come from Norway and not from the US, except for the end which is a great, melancholic and atmospheric piece with a subliminal industrial tone. All in all, the song writing has a whole lot of variety; each song stands out, there are – at least in my humble opinion – no fillers here. And the really dark and unique mood does the rest to please me.
The production, too, is really good. Everything is audible anytime – LRZ of RED HARVEST, who is responsible for it, did a great job. The artwork is uncommon, but suitable. “VioLution” has become a record where everything fits together, thus having a very long half-life period; and its diversity should appeal to a vast audience. Thumbs up here, and a definite recommendation. Too bad that there is no album after that, but if you have just destroyed the world, what else is there left to do?

Julian Charger – What happens if the pipeline gets completed? “I really have no idea. I’m hoping it doesn’t because we all need water to survive. It would be bad if that pipeline busted and contaminated the water. I mean, did you see what happened in Alabama? We don’t want anything like that happening here and contaminate it. Those pipeline workers must not have hearts cause they don’t care. They must not drink water.” Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “I’d like to think so, but I’m not sure right now.” What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “It scares me. He thinks he can buy his way into or out of anything. I don’t like him very much.”
Sara Jean Banks – What happens if the pipeline gets completed? “From my perspective it’s very symbolic, obviously there are a host of environmental consequences that could happen in the future if the pipeline is actually built. I also think it represents a lot of the priorities of our policy makers, legislators, and people in power and what their priorities are for people of this country.” Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “I do. I think it’s hard to do, but I also think that given recent events and the climate of our country right now that it might be easier to take this energy and place it somewhere else then if this had happened 5 years ago because I feel people right now are more willing and feeling like they need to be united in different ways. I think it could be if they had the right leadership.” What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “As a teacher it affects me in a lot of different ways, I have already seen the affects on our students and how fearful they are for their families and just trying to help them deal with that. I think personally, in so many different ways. Specifically I think about my family who is Tunisian so they are all Muslim. I don’t think my sisters would be able to come visit me now. I think about how my family would be viewed and there’s so many different things have been talked about in terms of Muslims and coming in this country. I think of an Afghani refugee family that we mentor and I think about what their lives look like right now and what the future might look like for them if people really feed into this fear mongering that’s happening with Islam. I think about my kids and their parents and how many of my kids are not here legally, but this is where they belong and this tis their country. It might not affect me directly, but everyone I love.”
Benji Buffalo – What happens if the pipeline gets completed? “It’s just like Iowa, when they went under the Mississippi, what can we do. It’s up to the president, it’s up to the army corps of engineers to stop it. I have no idea what we do if it gets completed?” Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “A lot of people from Iowa came here, now they have a thing they want to do in Florida, it’s warmer down there.” What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “It don’t ever affect me. I could care less about the president. If the law changes, the law changes. You just have to conform and do whatever they say. If it’s a law, don’t break the law. If things change and the economy changes, you’ve gotta go with it. There’s nothing you can do. It’s them with the money that control things. I’m not a puppet, I just live. Still go home, have to go to work. I still have to raise my kids whether Donald Trump is president or not.”
Chris Bakke – What happens if the pipeline gets completed? “Once again, we’re ignoring the environmental concerns of a pipeline going through this water which is at the head of the Missouri River which will affect a lot of people if there were a spill. There’s a civil rights component here where I think if this was land owned by white people or were graves of white people that this wouldn’t be allowed to happen. It’s another statement that our society continues to ignore sub groups of Americans who aren’t white.” Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “I hope so, but I’m not sure. This has been months in the making and this energy has taken a long time to get to where it is and it still isn’t very public. The awareness is still pretty low so I’m not super optimistic that it can pivot to other pipelines although I really want it to.” What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “It affects us pretty immensely. I teach in a title 1 school in Denver, it’s about 35% African American, and 65% Latino and most of my students are terrified. I teach undocumented students and they’re afraid for the safety of their family. I teach LGBTQ students and they have no idea what their rights look like in the future. Right now it’s interesting to try and support my students and their families because of the intense uncertainty that’s been put into their lives and overall their sense of security and safety has been shaken.”
Magen Kilcoyne – What happens if the pipeline is completed? “I think it will set the stage for other companies, for other factions of the government to get free reign. If this pipeline gets put it, I think it sets the tone for our use of energy in general. I think this is a country that should be far and away above in gather and using alternative sources, but the money behind it is really setting that stage. I think if the pipeline is completed I think it has larger implications for others in other countries as well because it’s going to be continuing the exploitation if you will. I think it sets the tone for corporations and big money, gives them immunity, which is really dangerous moving forward.” Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “I hope so. We marched in downtown Denver last weekend, with Denver public school students. It was really interesting, I’ve taken part in other civil disobedience it varies realms, but it was really interesting to me because the people who were downtown having a normal Saturday night were approaching us and I’m used to being defensive when an outsider approaches an action and I found that it was very different. These people were genuinely inquisitive and curious and were appalled when they found out that their media sources were not feeding them this information. I think if anything else this is an awakening in which people in various realms of our society, you see teachers, you see environmentalists, you see people of all different ages. I think it has definitely lit a fire that if given the proper attention through our more makeshift forms of media, I think it has that potential. It’s a bigger symbolism of big money vs. earth. The actions we’re taking are unsustainable. I think it not only takes this sort of resistance, but I also think it takes shifts in our standardized education curriculums. This group of teachers, we’re really lucky and being a social studies teacher, I’ve always fought that curriculum because it think it’s the agenda of the big money and government. I used to teach in Chicago and I’ve always been brave enough to say “fuck that curriculum” and I think we’re all at a school right now where we are given that license. I think it needs to happen under an umbrella of people. I think we need to shift what we teach our kids in school and I think we need to shift where we get our news. How else does it happen but from the bottom and it’s scary, but we’re teaching our kids to speak up even if your voice quivers. I sleep better at night knowing that we have riled up thousands if not 10s of thousands of kids in our generation of teachers. My hope is that it spreads and it might happen slowly, but it has to. “ What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “It will affect me probably more indirectly. We have a very large population of students whose parents might not be documented, or some of them might not be documented and it’s been a couple weeks of fear. I know trying to process what happened as an adult, and then trying to calm thousands of kids. I think the election of Trump has awakened some of these schisms that I think if it had turned out otherwise might have been swept under the rug. I’d like to believe that this is the catalyst that might really shift people because so much has been brought to light. I think we need election reform but it’s one thing to complain about what the next four years is going to bring but I think it’s equally important to start raising questions about the process itself. We know the mess the primaries brought us , let alone the bigger picture. One thing I’m really proud about is how our mayor in Denver, Mayor Hancock has said that our families in Denver and Aurora are safe. We will not enforce those federal laws coming down. I’m hoping that this election will bring not only the people rising up to say no more to this big government that’s in bed with big media and big money. My hope is that local and state governments will step up and stand as obstacles to some of these policies passing. We can’t ignore this. It has polarized people, but I hope it ignites people to say this is not what we will stand for. I told my kids, I stand for you, I stand for your parents, and I stand for your grandparents who have fought so hard to have a decent life. When we’re gone, what are the next generations going to have. I’m standing today because it’s just not a time to sit.”
Matt Otterson – What happens if the pipeline gets completed? “It won’t get completed, there’s no other way to put it. If they put the pipe in, the oil won’t go in it. We can’t contaminate the water. It’s not an option. That’s why everybody’s here.” Is this resistance movement something that can move to another fossil fuel fight? “I think it is already. A lot of people around us are fighters and they’re here camping right now. They already have their next destination planned and they’re timing it. They’re putting in as much effort here as they can to make sure everybody is safe and then they’re going to move to the next fight. For me, it’s not until this is done and everyone is safe and goes home.” What affect will Donald Trump’s election have on you? “Same as it did before. They’re all puppets to me. I don’t believe that any of them have any say and I think that they’re chosen long before so that they’ll carry out the orders of the above and you watch them stress, and wrinkle up, and turn grey and shrivel while they’re in that position, so it won’t affect me at all.”

In non-breeding season, North-western Australia is home to more migratory shorebirds than any other region in Australia and arguably in the East Asian – Australasian flyway. The most important two sites in north-western Australia are Roebuck Bay and Eighty-mile Beach, both of which are designated as Ramsar areas. This report presents findings from workshops and extensive shorebird and waterbird surveys carried out in north-western Australia in December 2008.
The Saemangeum Shorebird Monitoring Program (SSMP) was initiated in 2006 by Birds Korea and The Australasian Wader Studies Group. The aim of the SSMP is to monitor and publicise changes in shorebird numbers during northward migration (April/May) 2006-2008 at Saemangeum and the adjacent Gomso Bay and Geum Estuary (collectively known as the SSMP Study Site). The SSMP links with the Monitoring Yellow Sea Migrants in Australia (MYSMA) program, and was supplemented by a national shorebird survey in the ROK in May 2008.

The Turkish lira fell at least 13 percent Friday, as President Erdogan called for people to exchange their other forms of money to the lira. The currency is down about 40 percent so far this year.
Trump intensified the alarm on financial markets with his new tweet doubling the tariffs, noting for good measure the lira was sliding "rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar!".
Speaking to a crowd in his hometown of Rize on Saturday, Erdogan addressed the recent U.S. decision to sanction two Turkish officials over the detention of American pastor Andrew Brunson, who has been held in Turkey since 2016 over claims that he was linked to the failed coup attempt in July of that same year.
President Tayyip Erdogan told Turks on Friday (Aug 10) to sell their gold and dollars to support the crumbling lira, with the currency in free fall as President Donald Trump escalated a feud with Ankara by doubling tariffs on metals imports. "Repeated efforts to communicate to the U.S. administration that none of the stated criteria driving America's tariffs are applicable to Turkey have thus far proven fruitless", he said.
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed Saturday to defy USA "threats" over a detained pastor, showing no signs of concessions in a bitter row that has caused the Turkish lira to crash. "He has done nothing wrong, and his family needs him!"
"If there is anyone who has dollars or gold under their pillows, they should go exchange it for liras at our banks", he said during an address to supporters.
The news comes as tensions between the USA and Turkey continue to grow over the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ally's continued detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson.
The plunge in the value of the currency coupled with an inflation rate of almost 16% could cause a lot of damage to Turkey's economy.
Turkey said it would respond to the new USA tariff action "without delay" and warned the move would further harm relations between the two countries.
The sudden drop came when Donald Trump announced on Twitter he was doubling United States import tariffs on Turkish steel and aluminium.
Last week, the United States imposed sanctions on Turkey's justice minister and interior minister for not releasing pastor Andrew Brunson.
"President Erdogan's strengthened powers under the new presidential system have made it increasingly uncertain whether policymakers will be able to act to stabilise the economy", said William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics in London. "Look at what we were 16 years ago and look at us now". The White House said he had authorised them under Section 232 of USA trade law, which allows for tariffs on national security grounds.
Turkey, home to the Incirlik air base that is used by USA forces in the Middle East, has been a North Atlantic Treaty Organisation member since the 1950s.
Erdogan also Friday held telephone talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin, discussing economic and trade issues as well as the Syria crisis, the Turkish presidency said.
"The US has to rehabilitate its addiction to sanctions (and) bullying or the entire world will unite - beyond verbal condemnations - to force it to", he warned. Sanctions and pressure would only serve to harm ties between the two North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies, Hami Aksoy also said in a statement.

Areas of activities in nanotechnology include physical, chemical and biological research, synthesis and exploration of the properties and development of nanomaterials and nanodevices for use in different fields of science and nano-engineering.
The congruence of polymers with inorganic materials offer new possibilities to develop new nanomaterials with different properties and nanocomposites that are better than their components. Previous experimental study demonstrated that most classes of nanocomposite materials give new properties more favourable than macrocomponents properties. Therefore, nanocomposite materials have a big challenge for implementation in many areas of sciences and industry, such as nonlinear optics, sensors, photonics, new optical and electrical media for recording information, nanofibres and other systems. Of particular importance is the choice of inorganic and organic components of composite materials for specific applications.
Zinc oxide is a material characterized by a wide direct band gap (3.37 eV at 300K), with a low specific resistivity which allows to use it for the manufacture of light emitting diodes. ZnO is characterized by high concentrations of native defects: vacancies, interstitial atoms of oxygen and zinc, supra-stoichiometry of oxygen (vacancies of zinc, VZn), leading to the possibility for modification of the optical properties, conductivity and luminescence intensity in the "green" region and also in the "red" part of the spectrum. Thus, the development of the technology for obtaining nanocomposites p / n-ZnO-polymer with an attractive architecture, with a variable concentration of native defects which is an actual task for the development of optoelectronic devices possessing predicted optical and conductive properties.
Larger and richer populations are increasing the pressure on natural resources, further exacerbated by the immediate problem of a changing climate, with serious impacts on water, energy, and food security.

“He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth” Psalm 72:8 KJV
Where do I begin...?Im very loving person that has a passion for Music and people. The whole music thing started off at a early age for me. I met Nick Carter when we were 8 Years old. He moved from Buffol NY, down to Fl. just so happens that they moved into to our Neighborhood Rolling Green Village, We met at one of our friends house..I rode up on my bike and was like .."Who is this guy"..We went to the Lake and talked and became great friends!! Which is very one of a kind for both of us. We would play Nintendo all hours of the night..untill my mom told us to get off cause we are going to go blind..I think she was right.lol. Then Nick’s mom Jane got him into acting and singing..He allways had a great voice..Just so happens that he ended up getting signed to a record label at age 12 with the BackStreetBoys!!.I was very happy for him but very sad that My best friend was moving away.. B4 he moved we would play around with singing and me playing the Guitar(I was BAD at that time)..He allways told me to never give up on what you love!! I listened to him, He went on his path and I went on mine. My path wasn’t good for me. I Got involved with the wrong people, skipping school and experimenting with things you should never do. The only thing i had was my mom and sis and my guitar..When BSB became the biggest POP group in the world, I got a call from Nick saying" Yo Dude..you still playing the guitar right!" ..I said Yes I am!!..and he told me again to don’t ever stop learning it and practice everyday..so I did. He got back from his first eroupe tour and want to get back to our friendship..becuase for him..I knew the real Nick..not the BSB Nick..and I was so happy that he didn’t forget about me. I went to his place that was in Apolla Beach and stayed with him for 2 weeks and it was just like old times. He quickly saw that the Path I was going down was bad, and he wanted the best for me.Nick made me think about the Talent that I was throwing away and really take a look in the mirror. from that moment I made my path change. Then we went to Canada to suprise Aaron for his B-Day..I love Canada by the way. It was an EYE OPENER for me..to get away from all the bad things that I was getting into, I thank him for that! We had a blast then the family took me under there wing for about a year or so..I went to MTV Music Award show 9-9-99, from there he took me out on tour with him for their MILLENNIUM Tour. I saw how things worked on a huge table. It was the best thing that could have happened to us becuase he needed someone that really knew him to be there. It is very hard to be the biggest thing in the world and to have Fake people around you.. can really mess you up..When the tour was over he told me that If I got a Rock band together that he would Manage us under his N- Conrol Managment!!...So I found the people and we did it..He guided us into how to write Hooky parts, everything he learned he was showing us!!...It took time for Born into Kaos to develop the direction we wanted to go in!..He did great with us, we got singed to MCA Records in 03 and recorded and Album that got shelfed... but in the end We lost Frank Prevatte(Lead Singer) to Suicide. It killed me, the person that I loved took his own life. I miss him everyday and this is for you man!!...It took time for me to play again but I did. I work for the Best Rock radio station in the world 98 ROCK WXTB, Thanks Mike O. I love the gig. I know who my real friends are ....for the others...oh well..everything happens for a reason! Nick and I are now doing a RnB+ POP+RoCK= BAND..trust me...His Vocals are GREAT on this. We look forward to bringing this to the world!! I would not be where I’m at today if it wasn’t for my mom and Nick and my TRUE FRIENDS(you know who you are) We will see wht the future holds!!!

In my opinion this is a stunning colorful fish especially if the male is in a school with females. He will display beautiful blue and red color.
The most commonly know variety is the "Gold Fin" with the male being red in the body,blue face and blue fins. Females are silver with orange anal and pectoral fins,with a tipping of orange on top of the dorsal fin. They have several very faint vertical lines from the head to the caudal area. Other color descriptions of the Haplochromis Borleyi Redfin depend on location within Lake Malawi. The Haplochromis Borleyi Red Fin is one color variety of the Haplochromis Borleyi RedFin .Other common names or different spellings these fish are known by are the Chakhuta, Haplochromis Goldfin, Happy, Red finned Borleyi, and Utaka A few names related to the location are Kandango, Liuli, Sambia Reef, and Gold Fin. They are one of the largest Utakas. The are larger then mbunas and were once categorized as Haplochromis. Available in several color varieties, this species provides lots of choices to compliment your collection.
The Haplochromis Borleyi Red Fin are easy to care for as long as the tank is large enough,water is kept clean, and the aquascaping is correct. Though they are easy to breed, avoid cross breeding with similar cichlids to keep strains pure. The streams that flow into Lake Malawi have a high mineral content. This along with evaporation has resulted in alkaline water that is highly mineralized. Lake Malawi is known for clarity and stability as far as PH and other water chemistries. It is easy to see why it is important to watch tank parameters with all Malawi fish. This fish is not considered to be a community fish. The Haplochromis Borleyi Red Fin rarely shows any aggression to other tank mates except during mating when the male defends his territory. Even then, the male is more "bark" then bite. They should not be housed with aggressive cichlids or mbunas. They can be housed with Aulonocara and other peaceful Haps. Avoid keeping similar color and similar size to keep aggression to a minimum. They are said to fight with any blue colored fish. They are best kept in groups of one male and several females. The males are very gentle with the females and they will even school together if there is a larger group. These fish grow to to a length of 6-7 inches sometimes larger in home aquaria.
Widespread throughout the lake in open water areas, forming large schools in shallow or deep waters, they are also found over the same rock piles as mbuna.
Has been bred in captivity. The male is ready to breed in about a year. The female is a mouth brooder and will carry up to 60 eggs. The eggs take a little longer then the typical 21 days. They can take just over three weeks to hatch.The young are born silver with orange fins and they are slow to grow.
Please remember that the following comments are personal experiences and may or may not apply to your setup. Use them as guide to help better understand your fish, like us all individuals will behave differently under different circumstances.

The present work aimed to produce variety of colored samples of wool, silk and cotton from ‎natural dye extracted from onion scales for the application in the field of conservation of ‎archaeological textiles. Thus, wool, silk and cotton fabrics were dyed at three dye ‎concentrations using five mordants namely alum, tin chloride, potassium dichromate, copper ‎sulfate and ferrous sulfate. Different strong bright fast colors were obtained. The dyeability, ‎i.e. color and light fastness ratings were found to depend on the fabric type, dye concentration ‎as well as the mordant used. Wool samples showed the best dyeability and light fastness rating ‎followed by silk then cotton samples. High dye concentration gave the highest dyeability and ‎stability to light. Also it was found that light fastness of the onion scale's dye on the three ‎fabrics is very good on using copper sulphate mordant. The least values were obtained with ‎tin chloride mordant, especially on cotton samples. Unmordanted wool and silk fabrics ‎samples gave medium values, while cotton samples recorded low light fastness ones.‎

But we disagree. As we ve said, you won t get dramatic results from green tea. But it can be a very helpful part of any weight-loss plan. And considering the many other health benefits of green tea, losing one pound a month seems like a very nice bonus.
God is most glorified in us, when we are most satisfied in him. New videos uploaded daily. Subscribe today. "God's Plan" is a song by Canadian musician Drake. It was released on January 19, , as a single from his second EP, Scary Hours (), and the lead single from his fifth studio album, Scorpion ().
That s just not going to happen. Even at large doses, the effect of green tea for weight loss is minimal. For example, in a study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition in 2016, overweight women took either a daily dose of about 1,350 mg of green tea extract in supplement form the equivalent of roughly 15 cups of green tea or a placebo for 12 weeks.
Villain or hero? Debated for centuries, the volcanic soul of Julius Caesar comes dramatically to life in the new masterpiece of historical fiction from the #1 bestselling author of The Thorn Birds.
In this sweeping saga, McCullough traces Caesar's rise to prominence in his world, beginning with his triumphant entry into a new battlefield -- the Roman Forum, where wars are waged with words and schemes, and where today's ally may be tomorrow's foe. Caesar's victories are not limited to the political arena, however; he also conquers Rome's noblewomen, including the powerful and vindictive Servilia, mother of a youth called Brutus. Yet the one thing he never gives to any of the women who love him or want him is himself -- to Caesar, love is just another weapon in his political arsenal.
Epic in scope, razor-sharp in detail, Caesar's Women paints an indelible portrait of a man willing to seize any means of moving toward his ultimate goal -- to be the greatest of all Rome's First Men, the leader of a world that echoes our own too closely for comfort.
Colleen Margaretta McCullough was an Australian author known for her novels, her most well-known being The Thorn Birds and Tim.
Raised by her mother in Wellington and then Sydney, McCullough began writing stories at age 5. She flourished at Catholic schools and earned a physiology degree from the University of New South Wales in 1963. Planning become a doctor, she found that she had a violent allergy to hospital soap and turned instead to neurophysiology – the study of the nervous system's functions. She found jobs first in London and then at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.
After her beloved younger brother Carl died in 1965 at age 25 while rescuing two drowning women in the waters off Crete, a shattered McCullough quit writing. She finally returned to her craft in 1974 with Tim, a critically acclaimed novel about the romance between a female executive and a younger, mentally disabled gardener. As always, the author proved her toughest critic: "Actually," she said, "it was an icky book, saccharine sweet."
A year later, while on a paltry $10,000 annual salary as a Yale researcher, McCullough – just "Col" to her friends – began work on the sprawling The Thorn Birds, about the lives and loves of three generations of an Australian family. Many of its details were drawn from her mother's family's experience as migrant workers, and one character, Dane, was based on brother Carl.
Though some reviews were scathing, millions of readers worldwide got caught up in her tales of doomed love and other natural calamities. The paperback rights sold for an astonishing $1.9 million.

This one is strange... it's a SCSI-2 device to read/write PCMCIA flash cards. It's quite complex, it has its firmware and processor. I never tried it, but it should read PCMCIA cards, and even some SRAM cards!
This device is very flexible, it's well documented and allows even to access rare types of cards, such as ROM, EPROM cards, or reading OTP cards. It can erase EEPROM cards too. Reader supplies 5V and 12V according to card's requirements. Compatible with PC, Apple and some Unix systems. Definitely high-end device, in external version coming in a small 3.5" enclosure.
Unfortunately my unit lacks very important component - the front panel. It still can be powered and operated, but is incomplete.
You can find support files on Manufacturer's website or in package here. Docs are in separate package.
In some rare cases, it's needed to downgrade firmware to this version (/G version only, version 3.8).

Max carefully and curiously looked through the keyhole of his this little girlie's room and saw her lying on the bed. Her rosy vest was lifted up, so he could clearly see her gorgeous ass and full pussy lips that drawn him like a magnet. He slowly opened the door, came up to her bed and pounced on her fishing out his throbbing cock and thrusting it into her juicy pussy.
Ron entered the girl's room and was stunned to see her sucking her finger and rubbing her nipple through thin fabric of her top. He flung her blanket away and saw that she wore no panties and her pussy is dripping with juice. She tried to hide the porn magazine she watched and cover her pussy with her hands, but he grabbed her by the hair and forced her to suck his cock to make it ready for her juicy slit.
Nicole was sitting in the tub and didn't notice her ancient neighbor entering the bathroom. He stood behind her for a while staring at her charming young body and then grabbed her by the hair and threatened to drown her if she didn't open her mouth and suck his cock.

He told Mike that she was a really charming young lady and Mike said that he dreams to fuck her since the moment she appeared in his flat. Old lechers smiled to each other and began banging the crying girl pounding her tight holes with two restless cocks.
Kate was washing glasses left over from the night before, when the host of the house came up to her and said that she should wash all the dishes over again. Tired from cleaning the house she turned around and gave him the finger saying that she's tired to clean everything around each time he hangs out with his friends. Enraged with her naughtiness, he bent her down and taught her a lesson of good manners by fucking her mouth, pussy and ass.
Cameron got furious when discovered that this little ho was stealing money from his wallet. He stormed into her place and demanded an explanation. At first she tried to think up a reason, but then confessed that she just wished to hang out with her friends. Angered with her deed, Cameron forced her to repay each cent with her hot mouth and juicy pussy that he insanely slammed with his throbbing cock.
Jack was taking a shower, when he noticed this girlie peeping at him through a chink in the door. It was obviously a great chance to fulfill his dreams to enjoy her sexy young body, so he quickly got out of the bathtub, grabbed her by the jacket and dragged her inside. She tried to tear from his hands, but he quickly removed her bra and panties and thrust his stiff cock into the warm depth of her juicy pussy.
Cindy was dressing up for a school disco when one of her teachers entered her dorm room and said that she had to study instead of partying. Cindy said she had already done her homework, but he was inexorable. He tossed her onto the couch and began removing her socks and skirt and panties and then produced his stiffening cock and forced her to suck it. She said she would tell everything to the principal, but it didn't save her pussy from a violent fuck. Seductive teen coed gets brutally shagged by an aged thug

She tried to resist him, but he then bound up her neck with the hose, gagged her with the sponge and began enjoying his yelling victim to the fullest.
Ashley and her old neighbor were sitting on the couch and talking, when he suddenly hugged her and ran his hand over her springy tits trying to push it underneath her blouse.

She called for help, but he gagged her with his cock, then slammed her pussy and stuffed her little pinkie full of cum. Virgin pussy gets stretched by old violator's cock

He then came up to her, pressed her to the couch and thrust his cock into her mouth. He fucked her face for a while and then popped her virgin pussy and stuffed it with his cum.

No matter what type of writing that you do, whether you are writing an essay in a nursing class or an essay for a literature class, it has a main topic. In college level writing, most professors agree that this topic should be expressed in a thesis sentence. The thesis is a very important part of an essay because it summarizes what you have in mind for this essay and guides the reader in reading your essay accurately.
It is a statement that unifies the paper by stating the writer's most important or significant point regarding the topic;
It is placed most often in the beginning of the essay, preferably towards the end of the introduction, but at least within the first or second paragraph; and
Now that we know what a strong thesis statement is, we can begin to craft one of our own. Most effective thesis statements often answer these three questions:
Let’s suppose that I want to write an essay about playing sports. I might begin with a sentence like this:
This is a good start because it does express my position without announcing it; unfortunately, it is vague and general and therefore ineffective. It is not all that exciting for my reader, and it leaves my audience too many unanswered questions. WHY is playing sports good for people? HOW does playing sports benefit people? WHICH people benefit from playing sports? Asking questions about the topic is a great way to find more specific information to include in my thesis.
Let’s suppose now that after asking these questions, I’ve decided I want to narrow my topic into children and sports. I might next have a thesis like this:
Now my thesis is more specific, but I still haven’t really answered the WHY and HOW questions. Maybe I think that playing sports helps children develop better cooperation skills, better coordination, and better overall health. I might have a thesis that ends up like this:
Playing sports is beneficial for children because it helps them develop better cooperation skills, better coordination, and better overall health.
Notice that I have beefed up my vocabulary a bit by changing “really good” to “beneficial.” For help with specific vocabulary, check out the Using Precise Language page.
Most effective thesis statements contain this type of structure, often called an action plan or plan of development. This is such an effective type of thesis because it clearly tells the reader what is going to be discussed; it also helps the writer stay focused and organized. How can you now use this pattern to create an effective thesis statement?
Remember, this is not the only type of effective thesis statement, but using this pattern is helpful if you are having difficulty creating your thesis and staying organized in your writing.
I don’t need the announcement element of this thesis. I can simply write, “The importance of ABC is XYZ.”
I don’t need to write that “I feel” this because if I am writing it, then chances are that I feel it, right?
Discussing a statement of fact is extremely difficult. How will I continue the discussion of something that cannot be disputed? It can easily be proven that George Will did in fact write about equality in the United States, so I don’t really have a strong position because it is simply a fact.
Remember, a thesis states your position on your topic. A question cannot state anything because it is not a statement. A question is a great lead in to a thesis, but it can’t be the thesis.

On June 7th the top management of Isdefe came to Kongsberg for the signature of an agreement between Isdefe and Norwegian Institute for Systems Engineering (NISE) at University of Southeast Norway (USN). Isdefe is owned by the Spanish Ministry of Defense.
– For us this is an honour. NISE is the most renowned institution in Europe with connection to the most prestigious universities in the US, says Director of Consultancy and Strategic Processes in Isdefe Ángel L. Sanz. – So from one side we will get the best knowledge from academia. On the other side NISE has a unique system of industrial cooperation. Their programs are industrial oriented and they have a very good scheme of relation with the industry. And that is something we want to know how to implement. We want to learn from that specific way of creating knowledge, says Sanz.
Isdefe has 31 years of experience in very technological projects around systems engineering. The company is based in Madrid with 1 500 employees.
The company wants to increase their organisational knowledge on systems engineering, project management and logistics support. They want to identify the state-of-the-art in those domains, absorb the appropriate knowledge, and also position themselves as an entity capable of earning international recognition due to their contributions in those disciplines.
–We can also provide our own expertise, find new ways and generate knowledge from both knowledge bases, provided we respect security regulations in order not to transfer knowledge that can be restricted by security and defense section obligations, says Sanz.
– Probably in the future we can have students of NISE in our company helping us as a part of their curricular activities, says Sanz.
For NISE this collaboration agreement is a milestone – it is their first international agreement of this type in the ten years they have existed.
– This is a very special event for us, says professor Alberto Sols at Norwegian Institute for Systems Engineering (NISE). Sols has good knowledge in the disciplines Isdefe was looking for and was asked if he could help them. Sols replied he wanted to help via NISE.
– We are especially proud of NISE´s achievements in the Master in Systems Engineering. The students are tailored for our industries, says Pro-Rector at USN Nils Kristian Bogen who signed the contract with Business Development Director, Jesús Alonso from Isdefe.
After the agreement was officially made, the management from Isdefe visited GKN Aerospace and Kongsberg Defense & Aerospace.

The beginnings go back to the year 1947 when, right after the Annexation of the Primorska region to the native land of Slovenia (Paris Peace Treaties, 10. 2. 1947), the clubs of the neighbouring villages Bilje, Miren and Šempeter joined into the athletic society Telovadno društvo Gorica. They played on the football field located behind the Šempeter Hospital.
In Solkan, too was a club - the origins of which go back to the year 1918 with the foundation of the Volga Club - which developed football parallelly to the one in Šempeter. After the Second World War it changed its name into the football club NK Branik.
The first visible success of the new club in Šempeter originated in the season 1954/1955 when the sports association then called ŽŠD Nova Gorica became Slovenian Champion for the first time. It qualified itself for the Second Yugoslav Federal Division. The competitive strategy at that time was in general rather complicated, the names and the division systems changed from season to season.
An important turning point experienced the club in 1963 with the move from Šempeter to Nova Gorica – to the stadium Sports Park which, however, wasn’t yet completed. At the same time the Šempeter club merged with the club Branik from Solkan and got the name: Football club Nova Gorica. The team from the Goriška region was – except for two short-lasting periods of time when it played in the Division II - up to the declaration of Independence of Slovenia in 1991 member of the Slovenian First Division.
The Vozila club, named thus in the period between 1971 and 1991, achieved its best results in the season 1968/69 when it was second and in the season 1987/88 when it came third.
With the Declaration of Independence in the year 1991 the Slovenian football experienced its greatest decisive moment. The National Football Association of Slovenia (NZS) and the clubs had on the one hand a brighter future ahead of them but on the other also a more uncertain one. The Gorica club, sponsored from 1993 to 2012 by the local gaming and tourist company Hit d. d., achieved its first sensational classification – the third place - in the season 1994/95.
Already the very next season the football fans in the Goriška region could rejoice for the first time the title of Slovenian National Champion. In Nova Gorica that season, also for the first time, they played in the UEFA Cup.
In the following four years the club was always classified almost at the top of the scale - twice it came second and three times third. In the years between 2001 and 2002 the Club HIT Gorica was champion of the Slovenian Cup.
The result of the reorganization of the whole operating of the football collective and the orientation towards football players who are instructed and coached at home, was in the year 2004 the second Slovenian National Champion title.
After that Gorica achieved also the best classification in the European Cups. In the Champions League qualifications, in the second round, they beat the Danish champion FC Kopenhagen 5-0 and competed for the entrance in the Champions League with Monaco which was better.
In the years between 2005 and 2006 Nova Gorica rejoiced two more Slovenian National Champion titles. The season 2006/07, however, they closed on the second place, the season 2207/2008 ended as third, and in the season 2008/09 in the second place.
In the season 2009/2010 ND Gorica finished on the third place, on the year later on 5th place. In the season 2011/12 the white-blues closed on the 5th place also, and in the season 2012/13 of First Slovenian football league finished on the 6th place.
The season 2013/14 ND Gorica started with almost new team with lots of new players. On the competition Prva liga (Slovenian First division) ended in 4th place, but the club reached the final in Slovenian Cup.
ND Gorica won the final game on 21th of May 2014 at Bonifika stadium in Koper against NK Maribor. This is the 8th trophy for the club, the first since 2006. After three years ND Gorica also qualified on European clubs competitions.
Football Club Gorica (ND Gorica) played in Europe 42 matches and for four times they played in the first round of the UEFA Cup.
In 1999 they played against Panathinaikos from Athens, one year later against the Italian AS Roma, in the year 2001 against the Croatian NK Osijek and finally in 2004 against AEK from Athens.
In addition to the mentioned results also the exemplary organized operating of the football club ND Gorica has to be pointed out.
The young football talents emerge from the very successful and acknowledged Hit Gorica football school. The best football players compete first in the football team and there distinguished European clubs notice their excellent playing performance.

When it comes to looking for the perfect apartment, bigger is not always better…or affordable. And with the main demographic of apartment dwellers in Omaha being Generation Y—those ranging in age from 22 to 27 years-old—they are making their feelings known and developers are listening.
Christian Christensen, owner of Bluestone Development, has been working in commercial real estate for nearly two decades and owns several apartment buildings, including The 9ines and Joslyn Lofts. He knows intimately the wants and needs of those looking for their next space to live.
“We have done condos, townhomes, row homes, historic renovations…” says Christensen, “but our focus right now is on apartments…all urban. Part of that is due to the market and part of it is due to our passion for apartments.” While the Old Market has been for years the go-to location for urban living, Christensen says that things are changing, especially with the development of Midtown Crossing. “Basically, anything east of I-680 are projects that we look at.”
With his primary customers being Generation Y, Christensen says that price is a big concern. “To make [these spaces] affordable, you’ve got to work hard on floor plans.” He explains that most developers today are designing smaller floor plans because, not only are they more reasonably priced, but “people are heading toward a no-waste type of living.”
“When you look at how homes were developed 15 years ago, you really only utilize 60 percent of your home on a daily basis. The other 40 percent you’re paying for, but not really utilizing it. It’s the same thing with apartments.”
Combine this with the fact that fewer people are living with roommates, these highly sought-after urban apartments are becoming more accessible to people who, a few years ago, could only dream of living in these locations.
Jerry Banks, portfolio director of real estate for NewStreet Properties, LLC, also works with developing and remodeling apartments, as well as retail and office spaces. The Omaha-based company owns properties all over the country, including Tiburon View and Huntington Park Apartments in Omaha,. While NewStreet does not develop urban locations and his tenants tend to range from 20- and 30-somethings to empty nesters, Banks says that his tenants are also looking for scaled-down floor plans. “We’re seeing more and more trends toward smaller units, both in studios and one bedrooms.”
Safety and security is another big focus of his tenants, says Banks. “That’s always been and will continue to be a very important renter requirement…very high on the list.”
To meet the demands of his residents, Banks says that NewStreet has been actively addressing a variety of security concerns, including changing all exterior lighting to brighter, more efficient LED bulbs, as well as implementing new, fully automated locks for all their apartments.
Banks refers to the possible security breach of buildings that have master keys or by former residents who may have had copies of keys made in the past. “None of our apartments have a master key of any type…we’ve de-mastered 100 percent of all the locks on all of our properties.” Each key is also tracked by a bar code, allowing the property owner to know who has borrowed a key and when that key was returned.
“We put a real emphasis on safety and security for our residents,” says Banks. “These are just some things that most residents don’t see and think about but just take for granted.”
Both Christensen and Banks say that their tenants are looking for convenience and ways to make their lives easier. Fitness facilities, both indoor and outdoor, as well as pet-friendly spaces and amenities, fire pits, and plenty of grilling areas for entertaining are options that NewStreet is providing to their residents.
Bluestone is exploring the options of adding a hot yoga studio, as well as the possibility of shared gaming rooms and a community kitchen that may provide cooking lessons and opportunities for socializing.
Both Christensen and Banks say that customer service is their main priority. “Going forward, everyone is going to have to look at their operation and see how they can deliver outrageous service,” says Christensen. “Because that’s what our customers get when they go to other places. They go to Starbucks…they go to Urban Outfitters…they get outrageous service. They can expect that service where they live.”

The CNC Machinist program is helping to tackle a skills shortage in the Ontario manufacturing industry by connecting talented and hardworking youth with manufacturing companies for much needed positions as CNC Machinists. It opens youth up to a new career, while paying them to learn a new trade. Following an initial screening process, successful applicants enter a 26-week employment and training program – three weeks of classroom instruction and 23-weeks of shop floor, hands-on on-the job learning on production CNC machines.
This industry-led initiative is a different model for learning and training, providing an outcomes-based approach that offers tremendous benefits to companies. Rather than having to find good candidates on their own, employers can rely on the Ontario Manufacturing Learning Consortium (OMLC) to do the searching and screening for them. Initial results from the program have been very strong, producing results in an accelerated time frame, which is attracting the attention of more companies looking to address their own shortage of CNC Machinists.
The Structural Airframe Assembler program is helping to tackle a skills shortage in the Ontario aerospace industry by connecting talented and hardworking youth with aerospace companies for much needed positions as Structural Airframe Assemblers. It opens youth up to a new career, while paying them to learn a new trade. Following an initial screening process, successful applicants enter a 20-week employment and training program – eight weeks of training shop instruction and practice and 12 weeks of shop floor, hands-on on-the-job learning on structural assemblies in their employer company.
Our goal is to have 150 young people hired, trained and certified as Structural Airframe Assemblers by March 2016.

If you’re majoring in accounting or pursuing your Master of Accounting degree at TCU, you’re in one of the top programs in the country.
For the second year in a row, the TCU BBA and MAc programs rank among the best in the nation in the Public Accounting Report.
The TCU undergraduate accounting program ranks No. 15 and the TCU Master of Accounting (MAc) ranks No. 16 among all accounting programs of similar size throughout the nation (16 to 21 accounting faculty members), and No. 46 and No. 49 among all colleges and universities in the U.S. offering accounting degrees.
The Public Accounting Report surveys accounting professors at all colleges and universities in the U.S. for the ranking.
The success of the TCU accounting program shows. Every year, TCU MAc graduates boast exceptional pass rates for the Texas CPA exam, consistently placing in the top five schools in Texas. TCU MAc students have a 100 percent placement rate at graduation for the past two years in a row, with placement rates of 97-98 percent in preceding years.
“Our graduates are recognized for their professionalism due to the TCU Professional Program in Accounting (PPA), an innovative approach to provide a seamless transition from undergraduate studies to graduate,” Mary Stanford, chair of the TCU Department of Accounting, said.
The TCU PPA helps undergraduate accounting students develop professional and leadership skills, network with accounting professionals and participate in internships that lead to ongoing success in the TCU MAc program. Critical thinking and communication skills are an integral part of the curriculum.
The TCU MAc program is a 30-hour, full-time program that hones accounting knowledge and refines students’ critical thinking skills. It also provides the additional hours required to take the CPA exam in Texas. Students can declare a concentration in assurance, taxation, or financial reporting and valuation.

This was quite a quick project and I layered the different blossom sizes with pads and slightly shaped the layers.

What a pretty die, that's one I don't have. It does make a lovely topper and I'm sure it will look lovely on the gift box. Thanks so much for your lovely comments, always nice to make a new friend.

Hi my loves! For the first time I’m getting the chance to try the amazing and extremely popular advent calendar from Lookfantastic. I’ve been so exited, because I have heard nothing but great things and each year they sell out like crazy. I can finally try it for myself and tell you guys if it’s worth the money or not!
Lookfantastic launches the 2018 advent calendar to get you ready for the party season. A mix of deluxe sample size and full-sized products it encases 25 products sure to get you ready for party season.
The premium collection contains a range of all things beauty; from skincare treats to tanning, haircare to cosmetics, branded tools and exclusive products, this Christmas you can have it all and look fantastic.
Retailing at 750 kr ( $115 approx), and valued at over 2500 kr (around $387,45), it is the perfect treat for yourself or to give as a gift. The calendar acts as an ideal way to discover both new products and brands and is encased in a reusable vanity unit perfect for storing all your beauty treats and essentials.
https://www.lookfantastic.dk/beauty-box/lookfantastic-advent-calendar/11194782.htmThere 25 drawers filled with nicely wrapped products. I won’t spoil it for you guys of course, if you want to know what’s in it beforehand, you can always google it, there’s websites for that. Lookfantastic sent out a newsletter with spoiler warnings where you can see some of the brands included etc, so there’s an opportunity to know more. I just want to respect the people that are thinking about buying it and want to be surprised and have something to look forward to during december. If you don’t know if it’s worth it or not: Just remember it’s valued at over 2500 kr (around $387,45) and the past years have been filled with amazing brands and so many incredible products.
I have opened all 25, to see what’s in it so I could tell you guys if it’s really worth the money and if I would go out and purchase it myself, if I didn’t get it sent.
Now just the whole packaging is … Much more than what I thought it would be. And by that I mean, it is HUGE and super heavy. It feels solid and the drawers fit a ton of product, so you can easily use it after for storage. I would be mad if I spent a lot on money on something and all I got was shitty quality that would be ruined after you’re done opening. That’s not the case with this one. And that plays a huge part in why I feel like it really is worth it. Because this is not cheap packaging. It’s heavy duty, my mom was ready to buy one JUST because of that. She didn’t care about the products, she just wanted the whole thing to store her things in it. Now let’s talk about the actual products. We are all different and we ‘expect’ or want different things. Some prefer skincare, others prefer makeup, etc. So some will find it disappointing and some will LOVE it. This has gotten amazing reviews though and it seems to please a lot of people every single year.
I was VERY happy with the makeup selection. There’s some good brands, some good fullsize products. That surprised me and that alone made it worth it. There’s mostly skincare products. Some of them I could do without. Only a few of the products disappointed me. But there’s a good selection, a little bit of everything. There’s so many good brands included, a lot of my favorites which made me super happy. And I also discovered some new ones. And I can honestly say that it IS worth it. I truly loved it and would without a doubt purchase it myself. They did amazing and I can see why it’s so popular!
Bonus: buy an optional subscription on a Beauty Box and the lookfantastic advent calendar at once and save 20% on the advent calendar with the code: ADVENTBB
(this is a public code and not one made for me, so I do not earn anything on it, you can find it on the lookfantastic website)
Hi my loves! If you’re a beauty fanatic like me, from Europe and you are absolutely heart broken that you can’t get your hands on all of the amazing hyped up brands that you see constantly on YouTube – fear no more! I have found my new favorite website, from the UK and they have a TON of the most popular brands that I have been dying to try for so many years. They’re called London Loves Beauty
Just to mention a few of the brands they sell: Colourpop, TATCHA, Natasha Denona, Milk Makeup, Pat McGrath, Tarte and the list goes on! I really encourage you guys to check out their website: https://londonlovesbeauty.com/
They were so kind to send 2 products – Colourpop x Kathleen Lights Dream St palette & TATCHA The Silk Canvas Protective Primer. Two crazy hyped up products. I know the palette isn’t the newest collab from Kathleen, but I have wanted it for sooo long. Sorry not sorry! TATCHA The Silk Canvas Protective Primer £70.00: A velvety priming balm of pressed silk that smooths and makes makeup last longer while keeping it out of skin, helping to prevent clogged pores and breakouts. Now this has blown up everywhere. People are literally going crazy over it. And yes it is super expensive, but TATCHA is a very luxurious brand.
This multitasking skin-protecting, makeup-perfecting primer is for face, eyes, and lips. Silk extracts feel nourishing on skin and diminish the look of pores, fines lines, and imperfections for the perfect canvas before makeup. Silk powder makes makeup glide on more evenly and last longer, minimizing excess shine with a soft focus finish.
Now normally I stay away from these types of products, because they always just make me super matte and since I have dry skin, that’s the last thing I want. But I’ve seen a lot of reviews from people with dry skin and they are all loving it. So I decided to just go for it. And they were right. It does mattify a little, but it doesn’t dry out my skin or remove the glow I have from my other primer, which is so nice. The description of this product is spot on. My face looked photoshopped. There’s something about this product, it’s SO different and it really does work – which is why I can justify the price tag. I have no problem repurchasing this once I run out. My foundation glides on so much easier, it makes my makeup last longer and it just creates the perfect canvas. It IS worth the hype!
The packaging is stunning, it’s heavy and feels luxurious. Colourpop x Kathleen Lights Dream St Palette £30.00: Super versatile warm toned nudes with rich pops of colour can take your look from heavenly to out of this world in only a few swipes. Mattes, metallics, satins – every shadow is buttery soft and so easy to blend.
I assume everyone has heard of this palette by now. Colourpop is so affordable, keep in mind the price will be a bit more than usual because it’s a UK website. It’s still quite affordable. If you live in the EU, all items include all import tax, duties & courier clearance fee charges, unlike if you ordered off a US company which can really mount up when ordering from outside of the EU trade zone.
Anyway! This palette is amazing. Surprise, surprise. This is my first time trying Colourpop eyeshadows and I am so impressed. The formula is great, the shadows are buttery and the colors are stunning, easy to blend and it’s a good go-to palette. The only thing is, Star Dust and Twinkle are so similar, it would’ve been nice with a different shade, because on the lid they end up looking the same. Other than that, I’m really happy with the palette! All in all, I’m blown away. By the products and by the website. I know where I’ll be shopping from now on. I’m so glad I can finally get my hands on brands that I’ve been dying to try for years. London Loves Beauty are also really quick to get newest launches, so you won’t be waiting for ages. I hope this helped you guys that are in the same situation as me.
This may seem a little odd but for now I’m going to slump these two together . I’ll do my best to keep them separated..but feel free to lump your thoughts together. btw, check back next week as well and I will tell you a story of how I met the set of HIMYM…True Story.
I don’t have a lot to say about this episode. It was awesome to see some focus on Marshall & Lily. In fact this may be the most even episode of the season. Even, in the sense that everyone was involved. What I don’t get is other than the continuation feel of going from one episode to the next, why call it “The Magician’s Code” as well?
I digress. The point of the episode was baby MArvin “Wait For It” Eriksen… that and possibly giving us enough story lines to fill up next season.
Old Ted: Kids, sometimes the universe sends you exactly what you act for…other times, it sends you Lily’s dad.
despite not being a huge fan of Lily’s dad, this may have been the best we have seen of Chris Elliott on HIMYM yet.
Knowing that Barney’s bride was teased so much in the promo, twitter, act…I just want the baby to be born and move on…you knew it would be the last moment of the season. And seriously, baby’s are cute and all but I was over it before it happend. Awesome middle name though.
This finale honestly seemed so intense at moments I had trouble taking notes…so if I missed anything or got it off, just consider that your invitation to fill in the blank. Cool?
Barney. A wedding that that went horribly wrong. That’s what Ted said. So knowing that and seeing who Barney’s bride was/is… is that good or bad news for Robin/Barney fans? And what else do we know about the wedding once we put the pieces together:
Does that lead you to any conclusions? Or just more questions. Since we won’t know that till later…I’m curious if it caught you by surprise? The proposal to Quinn was predictable, not how Barney planned initially it seems but extremely well played out.
Ted. A bigger suprise may have been Ted’s decision with Victoria. The way I figure things…either he is trying to write “The Wedding Bride Part 2” or HIMYM writers got tired of throwing Robin at us and said “What other woman the we have told fans isn’t the mother that we could put Ted back with before the show ends?” I’m not sure they actually, physically said that but when I played it through in my head it had a female voice saying it. Not sure why. Will they be together at Robin & Barney’s wedding? Will there be cake? Did I mention that I love cake?
So much more to take in honestly, I feel like I need to watch it again to get my full thoughts. I’ll make this all for now though and leave my future thoughts in the comments.
While Robin wasn’t as much of a surprise, the Victoria moment came out of nowhere. I love being taken off guard.
I reserve the right to talk bad here if in the future I don’t like what happend with Robin & Barney… I trust the show peeps and all but hated the fact that Ted started by saying it was a Wedding that went badly…
What’s the end game of the Ted & Victoria piece? We know (unless all the clues so far are false) the she isn’t the mother… so what are you thoughts on there this is going?
Will Season 8 end it? No official word yet but Carter & Craig they won’t keep that a secret once it’s for sure.
I got the recipe for this ridiculously named beer from here and converted it in beersmith to look like this. I converted liquid extract to dme, and brought the projected OG into line with the recipe projected OG. Beersmith was calculating the og about .010 lower than the recipe called for, so I bumped it up by that amount. We ended up .010 over, so beersmith must have been off. Oh well.
For our 100th gallon we wanted to make something a little out of the ordinary. This thick, strong stout with coffee, chocolate and a bit of smooth oatmeal flavor will hopefully be a good cellaring candidate and have a coming out party toward the fall. It’s a bit over the top, since it has all of the big stout buzzwords, but it’ll hopefully be tasty.

There has been a lot of chat about the current floods and how they are affecting people which is somewhat sobering in this holiday season so when I saw Kate had done a list of Happy Things to focus on I thought I would have a go too.
A husband I love and two blue eyed children who smile and keep me on my toes. Parents I can call and other family popping in to read my blog and cheer me on from the sidelines. Thank you! You can leave comments you know, just click the 'annonymous' user option.
Our block of land. At the moment it is acres of thistles and an old house but we are turning it into our home. It is hard work but I feel happy here and love the local community we have found ourselves a part of.
Friends. Thank you for your friendship, support and blog comments over the past year. Keep it up next year too please ;)
Knitting and Sewing. I love the quiet time, the fact that I am creating something useful and nice for our use in and around the home. And the dancing Possum does when she gets to wear something new always makes me smile.
Thankfully, while our creek does flood, it does not cut our access or affect our arable land. We are lucky and our thoughts are with those who have an uneasy eye still cast on the weather reports. Spare a thought for the flooded houses, the ruined crops, the stock and the workers on enforced downtime.
I love all of the things you are thankful for on your 'Happy List' and your pictures were so moving as I read through each and every 1!!!
That is one great list. I realte to so much of it and reading it has made me happy all over again. There is so much hardship and disappointment right now but if we focus on the god stuff we are sure to get through it and to move on.
Oops, I meant relate and good. I think it is a bit funny that my typo said to focus on the god stuff. X
Nice to see that you can find the happy even in difficult times. It is what makes survival easier. Cherrie
Ahhhh Ms Becky your list has made my heart melt, so beautiful, so loving, you're one special, much loved, happy girl. Stay safe and dry Darling. xoxoxoxo.

What to Look For. The truth is, &apos;nature inspired&apos; does not necessarily mean it&apos;s all about flowers and fauna. It can be a marine-inspired theme, or simply a color scheme that is drawn from natural hues. For a color palette, look for colors that you would expect to see occurring naturally outside your window. This does not necessarily translate into muted olive greens or other soft, muted tones. If you&apos;re drawn to the red poppies in your garden, or that bright yellow hibiscus, then you&apos;ve been inspired by nature and you can easily incorporate that into your bedroom design.
Storage: All bedroom design ideas have to cater for adequate storage space. Cupboards should be designed keeping in mind the variety of items which are going to be stored there - dresses, shoes, jewelry, hats. Depending on the size of the bedroom, the cupboards could be large walk-ins or have to be incorporated into the space available. Spaces under the cots could be used to create storage areas or shoe racks. Cupboards could have more shelves or drawers, depending on the requirements. The bedroom could have ceiling to floor cupboards on one wall to optimize use of the other walls.
May you all enjoy good food, company, and of course, beer this fine Thanksgiving Day. I intend to go indulge in all three.
Tart ales are, like tropical rainforests, strange, fecund places that give many people the willies. Some just don't like acidity--fair enough. But for others, tart ales are filled with unknowable flavors that may be as lovely as small, colorful songbirds or vicious and aggressive as carnivorous snakes. Because of the variability, they prefer not to risk it. They leave tart ales to the fanatics.
Because of the wide variability of this broad category, that seems to be where we have landed: sour ales attracts fanatics and wards everyone else off. I am sympathetic. I was an early proponent of tart ales, back in the mid-90s when they mainly came from the relatively civilized wilds of Flanders and Payottenland. I came to adore gueuze, which, in my own idiosyncratic view, is the most accomplished beer style in the world. Yet I've stumbled across enough terrible, gone-wrong science experiments passed off as potables that I, too, have become gun-shy.
Which brings us to a new release by Breakside called La Tormenta. It's got several things going for it that make it one of the most approachable tart ales in recent memory. For one, it's dry-hopped, which gives it a point of familiarity. I don't know why brewers don't use hops more to accent tartness--fruity flavors and acid are a perfect marriage. Second, it's a lacto-soured beer, so it doesn't have the more exotic flavors that come from Brettanomcyes and other microorganisms. Finally, it's a nicely balanced beer, with plenty besides the acidity going on. (La Tormenta seems an odd name for a crowd-pleasing ale--at least until you learn it means "the storm," not "the tormentor.")
The brewery relied on Equinox, a newer hop, for this batch, and it produces a lot of wonderful citrusy and fruity notes--lemongrass and passion fruit tinged with white wine grape. The clean lactic tartness frames these flavors, and caramel malts tie them together by adding a hint of sweetness. It should be in stores now, which is good news for anyone planning on feasting this week. Although a robust 7%, it is light and palate-cleaning. On a day when heavy, sweet foods can overwhelm, tart ales can help scrub the tongue for more feasting. (And boon of boons, it's apparently getting sold for $6 a bomber, which is wonderfully reasonable pricing for specialty beer.)
A quicky follow-up on my two-part series at All About Beer on staling. Some folks pointed out that a few styles do age well and some improve. I did acknowledge that in the second post, and it's definitely something worth noting. The problem is that this truth seems to have overwhelmed the far bigger truth that most beers don't improve with age. Worse, the focus on the beers that do improve creates a subtle sense that age is good for beer, and this is definitely not true. I'm pretty certain that many fans are not aware of how perishable beer is nor do they recognize that a "bad" beer is actually just stale. (If you spend any time reading the ratings sites about your favorite beers, you can identify the many times this happens.) It is definitely true that some beers age. But they are the extreme minority, and if that's the one fact you know about beer and time, you have learned the wrong fact.
Staleness is not identical to oxidation. Long before you get those flavors of paper or wet cardboard, you get dullness; the intentional flavors placed in the beer leech out. These are the flavors we love in most of the styles we drink: delicate, bready malt flavors, vivid, green hop aromas and flavors. As a beer stales, those delicate notes are the first to go. Whereas in those beers that do age well, new flavors emerge as old ones fade, in most beers the process is one of subtraction. Arguing that this is good for beer is like arguing that bread tastes better once you leave it on the counter for a week.
Modern IPAs, which owe so much of their character to post-kettle hopping, are especially vulnerable. (Since they are the most popular styles among beer geeks, this fact is muy important.) But it happens in just about all the beers most people drink--light lagers, all of the light ales of Britain, most of the lagers in Germany and the Czech Republic, and even many Belgian ales. More than 99% of the world's beers fall into this category. (Because Belgian ales almost invariably go through bottle-conditioning, oxygen is scrubbed from the bottle and those beers age a lot better than most. Belgian ales also have fewer hops--and almost never late-addition hops--and usually have higher alcohol, two other advantages.)
I don't consider myself an expert on beer but I am a pretty reliable emissary from the brewing world. I've talked to hundreds of brewers in several countries. Except for the lambic brewers (who produce, collectively, something on the order of less than 50,000 barrels a year) I have not encountered a single one who argued that their beer should be drunk stale. Rather, they talked extensively about the processes they use to keep their beer fresh. I don't doubt that there are people out there who like stale beer, but it's akin to liking lightstruck beer. (There's no arguing about taste!) Except in the case of a few types of beer (either high ABV or wild, usually dark), the flavors are closest to what the brewer intended when the beer is freshest. Don't believe me, believe the brewers.
If this all seems outlandish, you can actually run your own experiment. Select an IPA you admire with a lot of perfumy scents and rich hop flavors, buy a bottle, and put it in a warm cupboard. Wait three months, and then buy a fresh bottle and do a blind tasting of the two. This experiment also works with English bitter, session lagers, pale ales, wheat beers, German ales, light Belgian ales--pretty much anything that's not strong or wild.
For your Friday surfing pleasures. Over at All About Beer, I have a two-parter about beer freshness: part 1 discusses why beer gets stale and what breweries do to ensure fresh beer and part two discusses why you still find stale beer on shelves and what you can do to avoid it.
I've also launched a website to accompany my forthcoming cider book. Both are called Cider Made Simple, and while the book won't be out til next fall, the website--still a work in progress-- is here now. (Fans of Cider Saturday may recognize some of the content.)
There's a lot of talk--way, way too much, actually--about which city is the best beer city. It's a pointless argument because no one can ever define the terms of debate. Every city has at least one good brewery and some great beer. Limit the variables, though, and then we're talkin. When I travel around, I judge cities on a single dimension: how advanced is the culture of beer in the city? There are a lot of ways to measure this (who's doing the drinking; what are they drinking; and where are they doing their drinking?), but one sure way is to see what they're drinking in places you don't expect to find good beer. Like dive bars.
The notion is this. Go into a dive bar, see what they're serving on tap. We would expect that bars on the outer fringes of the city to have fewer good beers on tap, while in the heavily-breweried, hipster enclaves, there should be more. I've been toying with the idea for awhile, but fate forced my hand when I found myself in the Clinton Street Pub, a dive in the pretty-cool 26th and Clinton nexus. I decided in the moment that the time had come to issue the Dive Bar Challenge.
Anyone can play. I assume Portland will easily crush all comers, but I don't actually have the data yet. Over the next few months I will tour the city's dive bars and report back to you, tavern by tavern. Should you live in another city and like to participate, just follow my handy template. If you fancy your city as "Beer City USA" or "The Napa Valley of Beer" or somesuch, let's put it to the test. I'm pretty sure Portland is in a class all by itself, but I'd like to see for sure.
The Clinton Street isn't at ground zero for beer in Portland, but it's ground-zero adjacent. Moreover, it is immediately next to the Clinton Street Theater, the kind of place that has hosted a midnight screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show every Saturday since 1978. One door down in the other direction is a vinyl record store (trivia note: I held the lease on that property for a year in the late 1980s when I has a teenage hippie artiste--way before that neighborhood was cool). In other words, it's definitely a neighborhood where you should expect to find a decent beer.
Nevertheless, Clinton Street is a true dive bar festooned with old beer paraphernalia like a classic Meister Brau sign and the distant-yet-lingering scent of cigarette smoke from years gone by. Clinton Street specializes in pinball, and on the night we were there, had a rousing pub quiz going on. It caters to all ages, but gets a lot more young customers than some dives. Of eight taps, only one was given over to mass market lager (Hamm's, my fave). Perhaps tellingly, the pub also had an obscure-to-Amerians Czech pilsner on tap (Staropramen).
*I may tune these up over time, but this seems like a good start. Breweries in ZIP code determined by the Oregon Brewers Guild listing. I selected Pioneer Courthouse Square, "Portland's living room" as the heart of downtown.
Here's a little question for the internet. As you may recall, I am experimenting with the pleasures of natural fermentation. Having secured three gallons of unpasteurized, fresh-pressed apple juice from Draper Girl's farm, I relocated it to a carboy and let it sit outside, where nature could run its course. And run it did. (A little too quickly, I think--late October was unseasonably warm in Oregon, and I the cider was fermenting at between 55-60 degrees. I'd been hoping for 50 or lower.) I racked the cider on Sunday and it was already down to 1.006 and tasting great. It's been unseasonably cold for the past week, and the cider is now slow-fermenting in the 30s, so it should finish out nicely.
Anyway, here's the question. It was only as the last drops of cider were getting suctioned up that I recognized the potential gold I was sitting on: a rich layer of wild Oregon yeast and bacteria, smelling funky and alive. I had not planned ahead, so I dumped it, but here's the thing: wouldn't that be a perfect slurry to pitch on a fresh batch of wort and get a cheater's version of wild ferment? Is there any reason I should not go back down the Gorge, get another gallon of Draper Girl's juice and use it effectively as a wild-yeast starter?
Imagine the beer market as a large celestial body with dense gravity. At the core of that weighty market are drinkers who love love love beer and wouldn't think of drinking something that tasted only beer-esque. They want the genuine article. Further out toward the fringes, you have people who dabble in other alcoholic drinks and are amenable to beer-esque drinks. Like me, they may choose from time to time to have a glass of cider, wine, or dram of whisky instead of a beer. Finally, way out on the fringes are people constantly drifting over to cross-over beverages; beer that tastes like margaritas or clams or iced tea.
The markets flow with the currents. If the beer market is down, it starts trying to appeal to drinkers beyond the core. That's what's happening now, as Americans, bored with mass market lagers, drink less and less beer each year. It can have very positive effects, though; that's the reason people have turned to craft beer. It can drive breweries to make bad decisions, too, as when they begin to put more and more emphasis on alco-pops, which further undermines the interest in their core products. (The hard lemonades and shandies are crack to the big companies--easy, short term highs that fall off the cliff after a few years.)
Into this environment comes cider, a beast that is, from the brewer's perspective, neither fish nor fowl. Cider's an ancient beverage that has national traditions and a distinctly artisanal vein--but it's also an easily-manufactured product that can appeal to those hugely fringey players. Brewing companies can co-opt the market, but they have to ask themselves: which market? Will they make an alco-pop, or try to appeal to the core cider drinker and slowly build a market that they might come to dominate in a decade or two? Is cider good for beer, or will it ultimately become a stiff competitor? These are not idle questions. Cider has become a big-ass deal:
As Symphony IRI points out, if hard cider were in the craft beer category, it would rank as the third-largest style behind IPA and seasonal. It also notes that 84% of cider drinkers also drink beer, which means a cider that could appeal equally to both cider drinkers and beer lovers could be a very powerful product in the right hands.
Whether beer guys like it or not, cider has become part of their landscape, and they're going to have to contend with it one way or another. In my constant effort to read the tea leaves, I decided to do a round-up of recent major supermarket-cider releases to see which way the wind was blowing. Keeping in mind that big drinks companies have millions to spend on R&D and market research, one would think that a theme would be emerging. It's a testament to the weirdness of cider that they seem to all be headed in different directions. Here's what I found.
For the past few decades, as ciders have constituted a tiny segment of the drinks market, supermarket cider has been keyed to the flavor notes of soda and aimed squarely at soda drinkers. It is an engineered product composed of apple juice concentrate (and sometimes, though rarely, a portion of whole juice), sugar, water, malic acid, and natural flavors and aromas. It generally has no more than 50% actual juice; the rest is flavorings and sugar-water. It is characterized by sweetness and an artificial candy-like aroma, and usually flavored to make it taste like fresh supermarket apple juice. (Interestingly, the intense, Jolly-Rancher smell and flavor comes from distillates of apples that are added back in--natural but artificial-tasting.) Many times I find a chemical quality to these ciders that I assume is the unfortunate side-effect of using such a heavily industrial process.
That's the baseline drink, one that has had decent success in Britain but been ignored in the US. Now that cider is growing in popularity here, how are the big breweries responding?
The gigantic borg that owns Strongbow (if you trace it back far enough, you come to Heineken) has decided to tempt the market with ciders that actually taste sort of ciderish. This may not be entirely shocking, because Strongbow is a Bulmers brand, and Bulmers has long had massive contracts with farmers growing proper cider fruit throughout Herefordshire in England. Strongbow recently introduced two products for the American market, Gold Apple and Honey and Apple. They have the classic sweet hallmarks of traditional mass market ciders, but also contain a fair amount of tannin, presumably from the vast acres in Hereford. Honey and Apple is made for the soda fans (I think "honey" is a signifier for "sweet"). It has a strange, heavy scent of flowers and over-ripe fruit and has an unpleasant chemical flavor. Still, the tannins are appreciable and remind you that actual cider is the benchmark here.
Gold Apple is actually kind of pleasant. It is very pale and has that damnable Jolly Rancher aroma (fortunately, it's volatile, and will dissipate after five minutes or so). But it has some nice body, a crisp effervescence, a touch of stone-fruit complexity, and is decently balanced thanks to the tannins. If you're thinking of Ross-on-Wye or Oliver's Ciders, it's pretty dispiriting. But if you're the kind of person who develops a taste for Gold Apple, you're probably also the kind of person who might find yourself drifting toward more real ciders down the road.
Anheuser-Busch's lunge at the cider money comes in the form of Johnny Appleseed, a name clearly the result of at least two minutes of deep Googling over in the marketing department. It is pretty much exactly what you would expect, only worse. It's the most pure reproduction of liquid Jolly Rancher I've ever encountered, from the artificial aroma to the intense candy sweetness (limned by a tiny touch of balancing acidity, same as in the candy). It's even has the same pale translucence of a candy. But A-B didn't stop there--it threw in a dash of chemical harshness for good measure. As I was trying to choke down two swallows for the review, I was prepared to call it the worst cider on the market. But then I cracked a Smith & Forge and realized that MilerCoors wasn't about to accept second fiddle that easily.
I guess MillerCoors decided to carve out a different segment--and they have. I'm just not sure it's a segment anyone wants to own. If I didn't know better, I'd say that Smith & Forge was an evocation of the old "New England" ciders that were fortified with brown sugar. I do know better, and I think this is serious over-interpretation. Smith and Forge is both "made strong" (6%, a tad higher than the others) but also made dark. There's not a drop of acid or tannin in the cider; instead we are offered the unpleasant cooked aroma and flavor of prunes by way of balance. The character of sweetness is not candy but molasses. It is heavy and listless, with almost no fizz. Appalling and undrinkable. Choosing between this cider and Johnny Appleseed for the title of "worst" is a real challenge.
In sum: A-B and MillerCoors are peddling an alco-pop they plainly don't expect to survive five years on the market (and neither do I). The companies made throwaway products for throwaway brands. If cider ends up getting a decent share of the beer market, Bud and Coors don't plan on participating in it long term. (And keep in mind they came to the opposite conclusion with beer. Shock Top and Blue Moon are brands designed to stick around and grow.) Heineken's calculation seems to be the reverse: cider will be a popular segment in the drinks market, and they want a piece of it along with Woodchuck, Angry Orchard, and the like. Indeed, they really seem to be appropriating the Angry Orchard model whole cloth. Establishing Strongbow as a line means they can adapt to the changes in the market. Honey and Apple may be appealing to the same alco-pop market as Smith & Forge and Johnny Appleseed, but they can also release other products, including, presumably, a traditional cider if that's the way the market goes.
Big beer is happy to cash in on the trend of cider, but for the most part, it doesn't yet seem to think that trend will turn into something substantial. That could be a pricey assumption. My guess is that once we've long forgotten about Smith & Forge and Johnny Appleseed, A-B and MillerCoors (or AB MC InBev or whatever) will be back with something new to try to crack the market.
Last week, Alaska and Oregon joined Colorado and Washington in legalizing recreational marijuana. What do these four states have in common? Robust local brewing scenes. Indeed, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado--along with California, another state likely to pass recreational marijuana--are the most active and influential brewing states in the country. Alaska may not have the influence of the big four, but it is a top-ten state in terms of breweries per capita. (DC, which also legalized weed, ranks 13th.)
That's some intriguing correlation, but does it mean anything? And more to the point from the brewing perspective--will marijuana affect beer sales?
It looks like the jury's still out--and probably will be for another year or two. Researchers looked into how medical marijuana affected beer sales, but the results were mixed. The results are made muddier because craft beer and mass market beer weren't disaggregated in the studies. This points to a larger problem with data in general--we know that a small slice of beer drinkers consume a large majority of the beer, but we don't know what kind of beer they're drinking. That pattern, known as the Pareto principle, also applies to marijuana. Until we have a better sense of who heavy users are and what they consume, it's hard to make predictions about the future.
I'll be watching two competing factors. The first is a cultural harmony or resonance between the two worlds. Beer has long used the language of ganja to describe certain aromas and flavors in hops, and the mellow, West Coast culture applies to both equally well. We've already seen Washington breweries have some fun with the new law. On the other hand, good beer and marijuana habits are expensive. Wages have been flat forever, and people have limited resources to spend on luxuries like booze and weed. Will their budgets allow them to spend lavishly on both?
Big public policy changes generally arrive with a bunch of unexpected outcomes. Legal marijuana hasn't been around long enough for us to fully assess them, but time will tell. Anyone willing to lay down a prediction?
Two new books are arriving on bookshelves (just in time for the holidays) from local writers. The first is a companion to Pete Dunlop's history of Portland beer: Bend Beer by Jon Abernathy (and a foreward by Gary Fish). The second is the long-awaited guide to Oregon breweries called, well, Oregon Breweries by the peripatetic Brian Yaeger, just back from Amsterdam. I have read neither book (Yaeger's isn't actually available yet), and yet having read Jon and Brian for years, I feel certain they are going to be worth owning.
By chance (or rather good planning), both will be at Belmont Station on December 6 at 5pm for a joint signing and beer-sampling event. (And Brian's release party happens December 1, 7pm at Widmer.)
After yesterday's surprising news that Anheuser-Busch had acquired Bend's 10 Barrel Brewing, I wrote a post for All About Beer discussing some of the implications. I was trying to make two main points: 1) there's no benefit for A-B in dumbing-down 10 Barrel's beer--they purchased the brewery because it makes such good beer, and 2) that this kind of thing is the way of things in mature markets, so we should expect more.
The reactions on Facebook to that post are worth a read--and were totally enlightening. According to a preponderance of the comments, my points weren't just wrong, they were heresy: "Beer with no soul is not beer I care to drink" and "I say we see one more brewery who made a devil's bargain and lost the appeal of those who supported ... them."
This is absolutely fascinating to me because it illustrates the degree to which people relate to beer not as a widget produced by a business, but something of a higher calling. Let's do a thought experiment, and keep in mind the notion of souls and devils as we do it. A group of DIY-ers start a small business that makes an innovative, creative, and well-made product. Because they're a start-up, sales are small and the principals are earning enough to keep going, but they're not getting rich. A large company comes along and offers to buy the business and infuse it with money. They will keep the principals on to continue making their product and selling it to a now much-larger audience. Think about how people would respond if that business were:
It's hard to see how the outrage would be the same, yet shoe fans and comic book fans and tech fans are all passionate.
I'm not trying to make any bigger point here. Even though I no longer hold the view, I'm not entirely sure the idea of a beer with soul is wrong. We all live in the bubble of our own experience. I've spoken to brewers like Jim Bicklein at Anheuser-Busch, and his excitement and commitment to the beer he brews is no different than Jean Van Roy's (Cantillon) or Dan Carey's (New Glarus) or Matthias Trum's (Schlenkerla). My bubble has been formed by interacting with all of them.
But there are other bubbles out there, where people have different relationships to this thing we all love. One of the reasons we're in a golden age of beer is because people do feel this level of passion. Those who were outraged by A-B's purchase of 10 Barrel will help keep small, independent breweries in business, and I can certainly sign up for that. If they had felt this passionate about beer 50 years ago in Belgium, dozens of old, quirky breweries wouldn't have gone out of business and would still be around making traditional, sometimes world-class beer. Passion is good.
Actually, now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure beer does have soul. I just subscribe to a slightly different religion: I think all beer has soul. Well, maybe not Natty Light.
Update. As this story develops, it's worth following Twitter to see the reactions. 10 Barrel is saying "trust us," but that mainly seems to be sowing more mistrust (though 10 Barrel has their supporters). Comments on the Facebook announcement make for similarly interesting reading.
ST. LOUIS and BEND, Ore. (November 5, 2014) – Anheuser-Busch today announced it has agreed to purchase 10 Barrel Brewing Company, located in Bend, Ore. One of the country’s fastest-growing and most innovative breweries, 10 Barrel was one of only four U.S. breweries to win three medals and tied for most medals won at this year’s Great American Beer Festival, the largest beer competition in the world.
Over the weekend, Leuven, Belgium was the site of the 3rd annual Brussels Beer Challenge (which is like having the New York City Beer Challenge in Hoboken, but let's not go down that rabbit hole). It's Belgium's answer to the World Beer Cup--similar in structure, but slightly more Belgiany. There's an international panel of judges, but the majority come from Belgium (21%), The Netherlands (15%), UK (11%), and Italy (10%). Only 5% came from the US. I don't know what affect that had, but the results (pdf) look a lot less like they do at the American-hosted version.
The United States has been by far the most significant driver of the current bloom of new breweries in the 21st century--and also on the types of beer they brew. Because of that, the US has taken a lead role in defining not only the taxonomy of flavors (with the always-metastasizing style guidelines), but what counts as "good." It's time that other countries weigh in on these questions. The Brussels Beer Challenge has too many styles (51), but they are nevertheless far more constrained than the World Beer Cup (94). They are slightly different, and slightly more focused on continental beer. Excellent!
I also love the third of three points in the competition's mission statement. In an industry that sometimes tends to garland itself in the exalted language of a nonprofit, this is refreshingly honest:
To offer beer producers a promotion and marketing tool. The international scope of the Brussels Beer Challenge opens up significant opportunities in new markets. Award-winning producers will be given broad-ranging exposure and be able to use this first-rate accolade to support their business and marketing development.
This is the best story in homebrewing since October 14, 1978: native, American neomexicanus hops grown at the the Benedictine Monastery of Christ in the Desert in Abiquiu, New Mexico went on sale today to homebrewers. They have precious little stocks, and therefore the hops are mighty expensive. Nevertheless, this is an extremely cool prospect for nerds like me (I wisely ordered my 3.5 ounces of Latir before writing this post) for whom the idea of indigenous hops--even ones grown thousands of miles away--are irresistible. It's a bit of a pig in a poke, flavor-wise, but here's what's on offer:
If anyone does pick up some of these hops and wishes to do some bottle-trading down the line, I'd be happy to participate. I'll be doing a relatively low-alcohol (~5%) neutral pale ale or lager with my Latir, hoping that the hops have a chance to express themselves in that format.

The bedrooms are today sophisticated, elegant, stylish and comfy. There are lots of decisions that entered allowing the perfect bed room space, making it a personal oasis that guarantees a great night’s sleep, but additionally a location to flee, read a magazine or simply relax following a lengthy day in the office. To create an amazing finish towards the room your bed room, you need to pick the luxury bedding that simply doesn’t blend together with your overall design, but additionally offer you comfort and luxury. You can’t take merely a duvet set and expect to supplying you with similar results, you’ll need to concentrate on numerous factors to make sure that the folks you select will give you comfort and thus, cut costs over time.
The very first essential aspect you should think about may be the material you select. The quilt cover set comes in both materials of poly-cotton blend, the least expensive choice for 100 % cotton is much more costly for 100 % Cotton options. Clearly if you are searching for bits of comfort and luxury, then you need to select a high-count Cotton into yarn. Cotton is definitely the best option, but try to select a bed set consists of 100 % cotton plush. Cotton is really a material that’s very durable, strong and breathable. Simultaneously it’ll help you stay warm in the winter months and awesome throughout the summer time, making the answer ideal season to include your bed room space.
The 2nd essential aspect to think about may be the size. When you may buy a double duvet and it is now searching for any cover, you have to measure blanket after which match set. This is because high-quality luxury bedding comforter sets are frequently made by a few different manufacturers as well as their size might be very slightly different. You don’t want to create a tad too big or not big enough, to ensure that bunches in the covers in to the cover. You have to set to suit your bed and canopy just like a glove.
Next you’ll have to consider the color possibilities. Clearly you would like your fancy set to improve just your bed room, mixing together with your current color scheme. When you purchase the style of the bed room light, vibrant and minimalist, you might like to select a set which will provide that a little color, if you don’t select a color which will blend seamlessly together with your design, create a statement whenever you enter the area. This pattern can also be important. If you don’t like bold patterns, very trendy at this time, so there’s many plain obtainable in various colors. A design is really a hip, trendy and may give a spectacular finish towards the overall style of your bed room.
Always take the time to browse the descriptions when purchasing online to determine which is incorporated within the group of luxurious sheets you are thinking about buying. Generally the set includes a duvet and matching pillow cases. To pay for you will get one pillow situation, while double or bigger includes two pillow cases. You will have to find extra pillows along with a sheet that suits the colour of your liking perfectly. Two final part of selecting luxury bedding may be the cost and delivery. Always look around before you get the best cost to fit your budget and browse with the policy of shipping companies to find out how lengthy they take to obtain the products sent to you before placing the transaction.
The entry of your email address, password and verification value are the key parts of the AlertMail signup process.
You should enter your primary email address, one which supports full size messages. Do not use a cell phone or pager address here, as these types of accounts are size limited. You can add a secondary address for a cell phone later. Your email address is used to gain entry to the AlertMail web interface to manage your account. You have the option of receiving Alerts Only or Warnings and Alerts. The Alerts Only setting means you will only receive high priority alerts. If you want to receive Warning messages in addition to Alerts, choose Warnings and Alerts. This setting will increase the number of messages you receive from the AlertMail system as there are more warnings posted than alerts. You can change this setting at any time.
Choosing a good AlertMail password is important to safeguarding your account. It should contain letters and numbers and should not be easy to guess. Do not share your password with anyone. If you suspect any tampering with your account, change your password immediately and contact us.
The Verification Code is a special value that is sent with each AlertMail message. Whenever you receive an alert from AlertMail, this unique code of your choosing should be at the top.

So this month in Glamour magazine, there's the chance to pick up 4 full sized nails inc. polishes worth £11 each! This is probably one of the best magazine freebies in a long time. I love freebies with Glamour, it's only £2 which means you can try new brands really cheap.
Motcomb Street - this may seem black at first glace but it's actually a really deep and dark navy blue. This applies really well, it's opaque, creamy and will be perfect for the colder months.
St James - this is described as a pillar box red that will add glam to any outfit. I'm loving bright red nails at the moment and this nail polish couldn't have come at a better time. It's my favourite out of the selection and again, this is has the same lovely formula as Motcomb Street.
Glamour Glitter - from the name and not being able to find this online, I believe this is a limited edition polish you can only get with Glamour magazine. It's a fine, gold glitter polish that would look perfect as a top coat, especially with the 3 other polishes.
Elizabeth Street - I'm wearing this polish at the moment and really like it. It's a perfect baby pink that would be great for French manicures! If you're just starting out with nail polish, this would be the best polish for you to pick up. Again, it has the same amazing formula and gives a healthy look to your nails.
All the polishes have a glossy finish and look great with just 1 coat! These are my first ever nails inc. polishes and would love to try some more.
I'm also currently giving away a nails inc. Glamour Glitter polish in my Christmas Giveaway, click on the link to enter!
I got gold glitter and st james and the other two look very similar to polishes i have. I was also in christmas mode when buying these and for christmas time i can't think of a better colour then red and gold glitter. I am yet to try them but for £11 each i have high hopes these will also be my first time with nails inc.
I bought Glamour Glitter and St James first and they are so pretty :) Especially layered together, perfect for Christmas xx
I picked up Motcomb Street, but I want the Glamour Glitter so much! I'll have to go on another hunt for it haha xx
I am giving on away in my Christmas giveaway :)! But I think those two layered together would be so pretty xx
Wow, you have the best freebies in the UK with magazines!! I wish US magazines did the same but I've sadly never seen a freebie included :(
You're so luck you ran into the glittery one! It's the only one I want TBH but i can't find it anywhere! I think I might pick up the red for Christmas! Followed you. xx
i currently have the elizabeth street polish on, it looks amazing & since i giving my nails a break from colored nail varnish this was a perfect freebie from glamorous mag!
I'm definitely your newest follower - Do you think you could check mine out and possibly follow back please?
Great post and I made the most of this offer too !!!! I also did a post on my blog; www.imitationisthegreatetformofflattery.blogspot.co.uk
I got the gold version, I found it kind of peeled off with just one layer though, I will try it again over a better nail varnish though.
I'm having a Christmas giveaway over on my blog if you'd like to have a look http://picklejarsxo.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/christmas-giveaway.html

(a) Availability. Without leave of court or written stipulation, any party may serve upon any other party written interrogatories, not exceeding 40 in number including all discrete subparts, to be answered by the party served or, if the party served is a public or private corporation or a partnership or association or governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who shall furnish such information as is available to the party. Leave to serve additional interrogatories shall be granted to the extent consistent with the principles of Rule 26(b)(2). Without leave of court or written stipulation, interrogatories may not be served before the time specified in Rule 26(a).
(1) Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in writing under oath, unless it is objected to, in which event the objecting party shall state the reasons for objection and shall answer to the extent the interrogatory is not objectionable. The answers shall first set forth each interrogatory asked, followed by the answer or response of the party.
(2) The answers are to be signed by the person making them, and the objections signed by the attorney making them.
(3) The party upon whom the interrogatories have been served shall serve a copy of the answers, and objections if any, within 30 days after the service of the interrogatories. A short or longer time may be directed by the court or in the absence of such an order, agreed to in writing by the parties subject to Rule 29.
(4) All grounds for an objection to an interrogatory shall be stated with specificity. Any ground not stated in a timely objection is waived unless the party’s failure to object is excused by the court for good cause shown.
(5) The party submitting the interrogatories may move for an order under Rule 37(a) with respect to any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.
(c) Scope; Use at Trial. Interrogatories may relate to any matters which can be inquired into under Rule 26(b), and the answers may be used to the extent permitted by the rules of evidence.
An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable merely because an answer to the interrogatory involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact, but the court may order that such an interrogatory need not be answered until after designated discovery has been completed or until a pretrial conference or other later time.
(d) Option to Produce Business Records. Where the answer to an interrogatory may be derived or ascertained from the business records of the party upon whom the interrogatory has been served or from an examination, audit or inspection of such business records, including a compilation, abstract or summary thereof, and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the party served, it is a sufficient answer to such interrogatory to specify the records from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and to afford to the party serving the interrogatory reasonable opportunity to examine, audit or inspect such records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts or summaries. A specification shall be in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as readily as can the party served, the records from which the answer may be ascertained.

If defendant is indebted to plaintiffs for the goods mentioned in the complaint, he is indebted to them jointly with G. H. G. H. is alive; is subject to the jurisdiction of this court; and has not been made a party.
Defendant admits the allegation contained in paragraphs 1 and 4 of the complaint; alleges that he is without knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the truth of the allegations contained in paragraph 2 of the complaint; and denies each and every other allegation contained in the complaint.
The right of action set forth in the complaint did not accrue within six years next before the commencement of this action.
(Here set forth any claim as a counterclaim in the manner in which a claim is pleaded in a complaint.)
(Here set forth the claim constituting a cross-claim against defendant M. N. in the manner in which a claim is pleaded in a complaint.)
NOTE—The above form contains examples of certain defenses provided for in Rule 12(b). The first defense challenges the legal sufficiency of the complaint. It is a substitute for a general demurrer or a motion to dismiss.
The second defense embodies the old plea in abatement; the decision thereon, however, may well provide under Rules 19 and 21 for the citing in of the party rather than an abatement of the action.
Nevada Rules of Civil Procedure; Form 19 Motion to Dismiss, Presenting Defense of Failure to State a Claim
1. To dismiss the action because the complaint fails to state a claim against defendant upon which relief can be granted.
Please take notice, that the undersigned will bring the above motion on for hearing before this Court at [specify name and location of court], on the November 12, 2018, at [time set for hearing] or as soon thereafter as counsel can be heard.
NOTE—The above motion and notice of motion may be combined and denominated Notice of Motion. See Rule 7(b). A motion to quash and not a motion to dismiss must be used to raise defenses (2)-(4), Rule 12(b), to avoid making a general appearance.
1. On or about June 1, 1935, plaintiff issued to G. H. a policy of life insurance whereby plaintiff promised to pay to K. L. as beneficiary the sum of ten thousand dollars upon the death of G. H. The policy required the payment by G. H. of a stipulated premium on June 1, 1936, and annually thereafter as a condition precedent to its continuance in force.
2. No part of the premiums due June 1, 1936, was ever paid and the policy ceased to have any force or effect on July 1, 1936.
3. Thereafter, on September 1, 1936, G. H. and K. L. died as the result of a collision between a locomotive and the automobile in which G. H. and K. L. were riding.
4. Defendant C. D. is the duly appointed and acting executor of the will of G. H.; defendant E. F. is the duly appointed and acting executor of the will of K. L.; defendant X. Y. claims to have been duly designated as beneficiary of said policy in place of K. L.
5. Each of defendants, C. D., E. F., and X. Y. is claiming that the above-mentioned policy was in full force and effect at the time of the death of G. H.; each of them is claiming to be the only person entitled to receive payment of the amount of the policy and has made demand for payment thereof.
6. By reason of these conflicting claims of the defendants, plaintiff is in great doubt as to which defendant is entitled to be paid the amount of the policy, if it was in force at the death of G. H.
(1) That none of the defendants is entitled to recover from plaintiff the amount of said policy or any part thereof.
(2) That each of the defendants be restrained from instituting any action against plaintiff for the recovery of the amount of said policy or any part thereof.
(3) That, if the court shall determine that said policy was in force at the death of G. H., the defendants be required to interplead and settle between themselves their rights to the money due under said policy, and that plaintiff be discharged from all liability in the premises except to the person whom the court shall adjudge entitled to the amount of said policy.

The forms contained in the Appendix of Forms are sufficient under the rules and are intended to indicate the simplicity and brevity of statement which the rules contemplate.
Each district court by action of a majority of the judges thereof may from time to time make and amend rules governing its practice not inconsistent with these rules. Copies of rules and amendments so made by any district court shall upon their promulgation be furnished to the Supreme Court, but shall not become effective until 60 days after approval by the Supreme Court and publication or as otherwise ordered by the Supreme Court. In all cases not provided for by rule, the district courts may regulate their practice in any manner not inconsistent with these rules.
These rules shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the district courts or the venue of actions therein.
(a) To What Proceedings Applicable. These rules do not govern procedure and practice in any special statutory proceeding insofar as they are inconsistent or in conflict with the procedure and practice provided by the applicable statute. Where the applicable statute provides for procedure under the former statutes governing civil actions, such procedure shall be in accordance with these rules. Appeals from a district court to the Supreme Court of Nevada, and applications for extraordinary writs in the Supreme Court are governed by the Nevada Rules of Appellate Procedure.
(c) Removed Actions. Whenever a cause shall have been removed from a state court to a United States court, and thereafter remanded, judgment by default shall not be entered therein until the expiration of 10 days after service of written notice upon defendants that the order remanding such cause has been filed. Within such time the defendants may move or plead as they might have done had such cause not been removed.
(c) Stenographic Report or Transcript as Evidence. Whenever the testimony of a witness at a trial or hearing which was stenographically reported is admissible in evidence at a later trial, it may be proved by the transcript thereof duly certified by the person who reported the testimony.

Unless local conditions make it impracticable, each district court shall establish regular times and places, at intervals sufficiently frequent for the prompt dispatch of business, at which motions requiring notice and hearing may be heard and disposed of; but the judge at any time or place and on such notice, if any, as the judge considers reasonable may make orders for the advancement, conduct, and hearing of actions.
To expedite its business, the court may make provision by rule or order for the submission and determination of motions without oral hearing upon brief written statements of reasons in support and opposition.
(a) District Courts Always Open. The district courts shall be deemed always open for the purpose of filing any pleading or other proper paper, of issuing and returning mesne and final process, and of making and directing all interlocutory motions, orders, and rules.
(b) Trials and Hearings; Orders in Chambers. All trials upon the merits shall be conducted in open court and so far as convenient in a regular court room, except private trial may be had as provided by statute. All other acts or proceedings may be done or conducted by a judge in chambers, without the attendance of the clerk or other court officials and at any place either within or without the district; but no hearing, other than one ex parte, shall be conducted outside the district without the consent of all parties affected thereby.
(c) Clerk’s Office and Orders by Clerk. The clerk’s office with the clerk or a deputy in attendance shall be open during business hours on all days except Saturdays, Sundays, and nonjudicial days. All motions and applications in the clerk’s office for issuing mesne process, for issuing final process to enforce and execute judgments, for entering defaults or judgments by default, and for other proceedings which do not require allowance or order of the court are grantable of course by the clerk; but the clerk’s action may be suspended or altered or rescinded by the court upon cause shown.
When an order is made in favor of a person who is not a party to the action, that person may enforce obedience to the order by the same process as if the person were a party; and, when obedience to an order may be lawfully enforced against a person who is not a party, that person is liable to the same process for enforcing obedience to the order as if a party.
Jay YoungFebruary 24April 4Alternative Dispute Resolution, Arbitration Arbitrator, Jay Young, Litigation, Mediation Mediator
If a judgment directs a party to execute a conveyance of land or to deliver deeds or other documents or to perform any other specific act and the party fails to comply within the time specified, the court may direct the act to be done at the cost of the disobedient party by some other person appointed by the court and the act when so done has like effect as if done by the party. On application of the party entitled to performance, the clerk shall issue a writ of attachment or sequestration against the property of the disobedient party to compel obedience to the judgment. The court may also in proper cases adjudge the party in contempt. If real or personal property is within the State, the court in lieu of directing a conveyance thereof may enter a judgment divesting the title of any party and vesting it in others and such judgment has the effect of a conveyance executed in due form of law. When any order or judgment is for the delivery of possession, the party in whose favor it is entered is entitled to a writ of execution or assistance upon application to the clerk.
(a) In General. Process to enforce a judgment for the payment of money shall be a writ of execution, unless the court directs otherwise. The procedure on execution, in proceedings supplementary to and in aid of a judgment, and in proceedings on and in aid of execution shall be in accordance with the practice and procedure of the State. In aid of the judgment or execution, the judgment creditor or a successor in interest when that interest appears of record, may obtain discovery from any person, including the judgment debtor, in the manner provided in these rules.
(b) Service of Notice of Entry Required Prior to Execution. Prior to execution upon a judgment, service of written notice of entry of the judgment must be made in accordance with Rule 58(e).
(a) The Offer. At any time more than 10 days before trial, any party may serve an offer in writing to allow judgment to be taken in accordance with its terms and conditions.
(b) Apportioned Conditional Offers. An apportioned offer of judgment to more than one party may be conditioned upon the acceptance by all parties to whom the offer is directed.
(2) Offers to Multiple Defendants. An offer made to multiple defendants will invoke the penalties of this rule only if (A) there is a single common theory of liability against all the offeree defendants, such as where the liability of some is entirely derivative of the others or where the liability of all is derivative of common acts by another, and (B) the same entity, person or group is authorized to decide whether to settle the claims against the offerees.
(3) Offers to Multiple Plaintiffs. An offer made to multiple plaintiffs will invoke the penalties of this rule only if (A) the damages claimed by all the offeree plaintiffs are solely derivative, such as that the damages claimed by some offerees are entirely derivative of an injury to the others or that the damages claimed by all offerees are derivative of an injury to another, and (B) the same entity, person or group is authorized to decide whether to settle the claims of the offerees.
(d) Judgment Entered Upon Acceptance. If within 10 days after the service of the offer, the offeree serves written notice that the offer is accepted, either party may then file the offer and notice of acceptance together with proof of service. The clerk shall enter judgment accordingly. The court shall allow costs in accordance with NRS 18.110 unless the terms of the offer preclude a separate award of costs. Any judgment entered pursuant to this section shall be expressly designated a compromise settlement. At his option, a defendant may within a reasonable time pay the amount of the offer and obtain a dismissal of the claim, rather than a judgment.
(e) Failure to Accept Offer. If the offer is not accepted within 10 days after service, it shall be considered rejected by the offeree and deemed withdrawn by the offeror. Evidence of the offer is not admissible except in a proceeding to determine costs and fees. The fact that an offer is made but not accepted does not preclude a subsequent offer. With offers to multiple offerees, each offeree may serve a separate acceptance of the apportioned offer, but if the offer is not accepted by all offerees, the action shall proceed as to all. Any offeree who fails to accept the offer may be subject to the penalties of this rule.
(f) Penalties for Rejection of Offer. If the offeree rejects an offer and fails to obtain a more favorable judgment,
(1) the offeree cannot recover any costs or attorney’s fees and shall not recover interest for the period after the service of the offer and before the judgment; and
(2) the offeree shall pay the offeror’s post-offer costs, applicable interest on the judgment from the time of the offer to the time of entry of the judgment and reasonable attorney’s fees, if any be allowed, actually incurred by the offeror from the time of the offer. If the offeror’s attorney is collecting a contingent fee, the amount of any attorney’s fees awarded to the party for whom the offer is made must be deducted from that contingent fee.
(g) How Costs Are Considered. To invoke the penalties of this rule, the court must determine if the offeree failed to obtain a more favorable judgment. Where the offer provided that costs would be added by the court, the court must compare the amount of the offer with the principal amount of the judgment, without inclusion of costs. Where a defendant made an offer in a set amount which precluded a separate award of costs, the court must compare the amount of the offer together with the offeree’s pre-offer taxable costs with the principal amount of the judgment.
(h) Offers After Determination of Liability. When the liability of one party to another has been determined by verdict, order or judgment, but the amount or extent of the liability remains to be determined by further proceedings, the party adjudged liable may make an offer of judgment, which shall have the same effect as an offer made before trial if it is served within a reasonable time not less than 10 days prior to the commencement of hearings to determine the amount or extent of liability.
(a) In an action in which any part of the relief sought is a judgment for a sum of money or the disposition of a sum of money or the disposition of any other thing capable of delivery, a party, upon notice to every other party, and by leave of court, may deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing to be held by the clerk of the court, or upon court order to be deposited in an interest-bearing account or invested in an interest-bearing instrument, subject to withdrawal, in whole or in part, at any time thereafter upon order of the court.
(b) When it is admitted by the pleading or examination of a party, that the party has possession or control of any money or other thing capable of delivery, which, being the subject of litigation, is held by the party as trustee for another party, or which belongs or is due to another party, the court may order the same, upon motion, to be deposited in court, or deposited in an interest-bearing account or invested in an interest-bearing instrument, or delivered to such party, upon such conditions as may be just, subject to the further direction of the court.
Jay YoungFebruary 24April 4Alternative Dispute Resolution, Arbitration Arbitrator, Jay Young, Litigation, Nevada Arbitrator and Arbitration
An action wherein a receiver has been appointed shall not be dismissed except by order of the court.
Whenever these rules require or permit the giving of security by a party, and security is given in the form of a bond or stipulation or other undertaking with one or more sureties, each surety submits to the jurisdiction of the court and irrevocably appoints the clerk of the court as the surety’s agent upon whom any papers affecting the surety’s liability on the bond or undertaking may be served. The surety’s liability may be enforced on motion without the necessity of an independent action. The motion and such notice of the motion as the court prescribes may be served on the clerk of the court, who shall forthwith mail copies to the sureties if their addresses are known.
(2) Consolidation of Hearing With Trial on Merits. Before or after the commencement of the hearing of an application for a preliminary injunction, the court may order the trial of the action on the merits to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the application. Even when this consolidation is not ordered, any evidence received upon an application for a preliminary injunction which would be admissible upon the trial on the merits becomes part of the record on the trial and need not be repeated upon the trial. This subdivision (a)(2) shall be so construed and applied as to save to the parties any rights they may have to trial by jury.
(b) Temporary Restraining Order; Notice; Hearing; Duration. A temporary restraining order may be granted without written or oral notice to the adverse party or that party’s attorney only if (1) it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified complaint that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result to the applicant before the adverse party or that party’s attorney can be heard in opposition, and (2) the applicant’s attorney certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if any, which have been made to give the notice and the reasons supporting the claim that notice should not be required. Every temporary restraining order granted without notice shall be indorsed with the date and hour of issuance; shall be filed forthwith in the clerk’s office and entered of record; shall define the injury and state why it is irreparable and why the order was granted without notice; and shall expire by its terms within such time after entry, not to exceed 15 days, as the court fixes, unless within the time so fixed the order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or unless the party against whom the order is directed consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The reasons for the extension shall be entered of record. In case a temporary restraining order is granted without notice, the motion for a preliminary injunction shall be set down for hearing at the earliest possible time and takes precedence of all matters except older matters of the same character; and when the motion comes on for hearing the party who obtained the temporary restraining order shall proceed with the application for a preliminary injunction and, if the party does not do so, the court shall dissolve the temporary restraining order. On 2 days’ notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining order without notice or on such shorter notice to that party as the court may prescribe, the adverse party may appear and move its dissolution or modification and in that event the court shall proceed to hear and determine such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.
(c) Security. No restraining order or preliminary injunction shall issue except upon the giving of security by the applicant, in such sum as the court deems proper, for the payment of such costs and damages as may be incurred or suffered by any party who is found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained. No such security shall be required of the State or of an officer or agency thereof.
(d) Form and Scope of Injunction or Restraining Order. Every order granting an injunction and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in reasonable detail, and not by reference to the complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and upon those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.
(f) When Inapplicable. This rule is not applicable to suits for divorce, alimony, separate maintenance or custody of children. In such suits, the court may make prohibitive or mandatory orders, with or without notice or bond, as may be just.
At the commencement of and during the course of an action, all remedies providing for seizure of person or property for the purpose of securing satisfaction of the judgment ultimately to be entered in the action are available under the circumstances and in the manner provided by the law of the State. The remedies thus available include arrest, attachment, garnishment, replevin, sequestration, and other corresponding or equivalent remedies, however designated.
If a trial or hearing has been commenced and the judge is unable to proceed, any other judge may proceed with it upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the proceedings in the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties. In a hearing or trial without a jury, the successor judge shall at the request of a party recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify again without undue burden. The successor judge may also recall any other witness. But if such successor judge cannot perform those duties because the successor judge did not preside at the trial or for any other reason, the successor judge may, in that judge’s discretion, grant a new trial.
(a) Automatic Stay; Exceptions—Injunctions and Receiverships. Except as stated herein, no execution shall issue upon a judgment nor shall proceedings be taken for its enforcement until the expiration of 10 days after service of written notice of its entry. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, an interlocutory or final judgment in an action for an injunction or in a receivership action shall not be stayed during the period after its entry and until an appeal is taken or during the pendency of an appeal. The provisions of subdivision (c) of this rule govern the suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting of an injunction during the pendency of an appeal.
(b) Stay on Motion for New Trial or for Judgment. In its discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party as are proper, the court may stay the execution of or any proceedings to enforce a judgment pending the disposition of a motion for a new trial or to alter or amend a judgment made pursuant to Rule 59, or of a motion for relief from a judgment or order made pursuant to Rule 60, or of a motion for judgment in accordance with a motion for a judgment as a matter of law made pursuant to Rule 50, or of a motion for amendment to the findings or for additional findings made pursuant to Rule 52(b).
(c) Injunction Pending Appeal. When an appeal is taken from an interlocutory or final judgment granting, dissolving, or denying an injunction, the court in its discretion may suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of the appeal upon such terms as to bond or otherwise as it considers proper for the security of the rights of the adverse party.
(d) Stay Upon Appeal. When an appeal is taken the appellant by giving a supersedeas bond may obtain a stay subject to the exceptions contained in subdivision (a) of this rule. The bond may be given at or after the time of filing the notice of appeal. The stay is effective when the supersedeas bond is filed.
(e) Stay in Favor of the State or Agency Thereof. When an appeal is taken by the State or by any county, city or town within the State, or an officer or agency thereof and the operation or enforcement of the judgment is stayed, no bond, obligation, or other security shall be required from the appellant.
(g) Power of Appellate Court Not Limited. The provisions in this rule do not limit any power of an appellate court or of a judge or justice thereof to stay proceedings during the pendency of an appeal or to suspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction during the pendency of an appeal or to make any order appropriate to preserve the status quo or the effectiveness of the judgment subsequently to be entered.
(h) Stay of Judgment as to Multiple Claims or Multiple Parties. When a court has ordered a final judgment under the conditions stated in Rule 54(b), the court may stay enforcement of that judgment until the entering of a subsequent judgment or judgments and may prescribe such conditions as are necessary to secure the benefit thereof to the party in whose favor the judgment is entered.
No error in either the admission or the exclusion of evidence and no error or defect in any ruling or order or in anything done or omitted by the court or by any of the parties is ground for granting a new trial or for setting aside a verdict or for vacating, modifying or otherwise disturbing a judgment or order, unless refusal to take such action appears to the court inconsistent with substantial justice. The court at every stage of the proceeding must disregard any error or defect in the proceeding which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.

Building on our post last year about Marcal’s line of earth-friendly paper products, Kimberly Clark has taken green innovation to the next step with its new Tube-free bath tissue.
Launched exclusively in Walmart and Sam’s Club stores, the new tube-free bath tissues offer consumers a visible way to help reduce the 160 million pounds of trash (usually not recycled) generated by discarded toilet paper tubes.
One downside – the new Tube-free offering does not use recycled paper, like the rest of the Scott Naturals line. However, K-C personnel indicate a move to at least 40% recycled-content paper is in the planning stages, especially if the product is launched into other retail outlets.
Summer 2010 could have been dubbed the “Summer of Snooki”, named for the much discussed breakout “star” of MTV’s hit reality show Jersey Shore. For months, Snooki and her male counterpart The Situation have been getting more than their 15 minutes of fame via constant exposure – tabloid TV and magazines, website chatter and tweets – all anxiously reporting on every drunken stumble, questionable wardrobe selection and salacious hookup. It’s been widely reported that Snooki was paid $30,000 per episode to appear in Season 2 – not bad for a 22 year-old former veterinarian technician student; and Elle magazine has just selected her as one of Hollywood’s most powerful women, alongside studio heads, network chiefs and Oscar winners such as Angelina Jolie and Sandra Bullock.
But this discussion is not about the supposed shame Jersey Shore’s cast has brought to the Garden State, but rather some thoughts on the impact of extreme personalities in our dynamic media and marketing environment. Some, including The Atlantic’s Mark Ambinder posit that the pervasiveness of reality show characters has made wacky, crazy political candidates more acceptable:
But all the reality shows — and the characters who have been mainstreamed and are now a part of our lives, people who we would otherwise encounter when we browsed the tabloids at the supermarket — have conditioned us for “wild and woolly” candidates. Culture bleeds into politics, and the other way around.
Next week’s elections won’t spell the end of the parade of dysfunctional loudmouths – the winners will take their places in Washington DC and state capitols around the country to pontificate for the next 2, 4 or 6 years. And some of the losers will leverage their new-found visibility into talk shows, book contracts and continue to assault our senses for months to come. And every night we’re treated to another batch of reality show contestants – teen parents, addicts, alleged singers and dancers – will marketers’ messages be able break through this cacophony?
As mass media content (both entertainment and news) becomes extreme will marketing tactics need to become even more extreme to capture the attention of consumers? Or will a softer tone get the message across more effectively?
” the global tide of conspicuous consumption is turning away from traditional status symbols of the past and moving toward products and brands that support sustainability. Protecting the environment, improving healthcare and reducing poverty are the causes that global consumers care about most.”
Marketers are taking notice of this. As discussed in a previous post, we believe there are new value areas to be mined-areas that people will resonate to more deeply-a higher order level of value. And ‘Green Value’ represents one of those opportunities.
One of the more visible efforts in this direction can be observed with P&G’s Dawn Dishwashing Liquid. When the brand came to the rescue in the Gulf Coast what quickly followed was an eco-friendly advertising message featuring Dawn as “the only product that can be used to clean oil-soaked animals” and a promotion where portion of sales would be contributed to Save Wildlife.
Yes, the notion of green (which initially spoke to environmental or macro-level conservation) has trickled down and has become personal. And, as green becomes personal, consumers are finding ways to make more personally and socially responsible decisions about how they spend their money-choices they view as long-term solutions.
Reduce-Reuse-Recycle is a long standing initiative referring to minimization of waste materials, and you don’t have to go very far to see charts instructing us on how to accomplish this.
What we want to explore has to do with the mindset that consumers are bringing to their decision making process. To this end, let’s take a look at three living green solutions!
The growth in the buy local movement speaks to a sustainability strategy with benefits that extend beyond the “feel good” support your community. Not only might it have favorable economic implications for a community or region, it becomes a deeper way for consumers to demonstrate environmental responsibility. In addition to thinking of local in terms of geography, we propose thinking of it as a micro concept so we actively include smaller enterprises in our decision-making set for whatever we consume.
Just as individuals flock to farmers’ markets in cities across the country or seeing ‘buy local’ triggers one’s commitment to support local growers, people are applying this concept to other sectors.
Imagine customers being motivated to switch their financial portfolio from an investment banking leader to Domini Social Investments, an investment firm committed to socially conscious investing. Investors can directly support underserved communities in every state through a special Social Bond Fund.
Then there are restaurants like Red Robin being recognized by the National Restaurant Association in an annual reward designed to “raise awareness about the restaurant industry’s contributions to local communities and to inspire other restaurant operators and owners to do the same.” Or Jimmy’s No. 43, one of the first restaurants in New York City to stop serving bottled water, hosting slow-food events and featuring a slow-food menu as part of its commitment to the Slow-Food movement.
The impact of ‘local/green’ solutions can also be applied to other product and service providers. Let’s spotlight some existing and potential opportunities.
Apparel. Environmentally friendly clothing is no longer limited to niche brands. Now you can count Van Heusen, Levi and Eileen Fisher among the companies with organic entries.
Food/Beverages. Major soft drink and beverage marketers, such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi maintain dozens of bottling facilities across the country. Prominent label copy highlighting “bottled in Philadelphia, PA, or Tampa, FL, or Portland, OR” would remind consumers of the reduced carbon footprint and improved product freshness of a product bottled nearby.
Restaurants. Jim Denevan, founder of the traveling restaurant series Outstanding in the Field, has made it his commitment “to re-connect diners to the land and the origins of their food, and to honor the local farmers and food artisans who cultivate it.” The OITF experience is captured vividly in Deborah Moss’ column, Foodie feasts straight from the farm. Restaurants participating in New Jersey’s Restaurant Week promote special efforts to include locally grown/sourced ingredients in their menu offerings.
Retail. From Whole Foods to supermarket giant Kroger, grocery stores are highlighting locally grown produce and specialty products.
Travel. The Staycation (or vacationing close to home) phenomenon, triggered by the economic downturn, has become a feature of hotels from luxury brands like The Breakers Palm Beach or major chains like Marriott or Hilton. Even state tourist boards are seeing the value of strategies to encourage travelers to spend their recreation dollars in their state or neighboring states. In addition to the cost savings, travelers also get the benefit of lightening their carbon footprint.
In this time of near double-digit unemployment, rampant underemployment, sky-rocketing home foreclosures and other adverse economic factors, the emergence of the tightfisted consumer was totally predictable. What was spawned from necessity does not appear to be a short-term strategy. Rather, it is becoming a way of life for a majority of Americans.
Harris Interactive reports that American consumers continue to hold the line on spending, with 63% purchasing more generic (private label) branded products. This behavior is consistent across generations.
A recent study from Decitica, “Marketing to the Post-Recession Consumers“ posits that consumer spending patterns have been profoundly altered by the current recession and we are now entering a period of “new normal.” Decitica has identified four distinct consumer segments – Steadfast Frugalists, Involuntary Penny-Pinchers, Pragmatic Spenders, and Apathetic Materialists.
While consumers’ commitment and focus on finding the lowest prices vary, it’s clear that price-related value is no longer a competitive advantage. Rather, it has become an expected attribute for many purchasers.
The traditional retail “fix” of offering discounts is no longer (or is fast becoming) like email SPAM. In other words, buyers are applying their own mental filters to these offers, going for the lowest price point across many product categories. But, this approach has resulted in store brands in some categories becoming category leaders – suggesting that lower pricing as a strategy is a form of value that brand marketers cannot sustain.
Given these conditions, it is clear that the days of price discounts as the sole expression of value are over.
As consumers navigate the new economic world order, more than ever, they want to feel they are getting the best value for their money. Marketers will need to be more inventive in their offers and create products as well as marketing messaging that imbue brands with discernible value. So the question is this:
In recent years, companies have begun to enhance brand value with what might be described as product-driven, functional value strategies.
Some brands, many in the Procter & Gamble stable, are combining well-recognized attributes of premium brands such as Dawn Hand Renewal with Olay Beauty, Mr. Clean with Febreze Freshness, Tide with a Touch of Downy to offer consumers an assurance of product performance and desirable attributes. This brand-combining strategy has enabled P&G to maintain its premium priced edge.
In the current new campaign for 1800 Tequila, the commercial’s protagonist points to the functionality of the cap as a point-of-difference with Patron.
Clearly, if there are product elements that can be leveraged as these examples demonstrate, marketers should naturally capitalize on these product advantages. But, there is also a consumer-driven factor that is likely to strengthen this trend towards a new value paradigm and we believe this is an attitude of responsibility. Specifically, people are becoming more responsible when it comes to the ‘stuff’ they acquire.
When you layer on facts like declining disposable income or postponing retirement out of financial necessity, it is inevitable that the purchase decision process will be more conscious, even introspective as buyers weigh their choices. And, the factors weighed are likely to reflect factors that might not have considered in the past. With these shifting attitudes, we believe there are new value areas to be mined-areas that people will resonate to more deeply-a higher order level of value.
As we look to redefine value in this new era, it is important to look at areas that are likely to have an enduring impact on consumers’ purchase decision process. We believe these reflect what used to be incidental benefits but now are more at the forefront that ever before. By tapping into these avenues of opportunity, brand perceptions will be enhanced and companies will have a chance to make a new impression in the marketplace.
In subsequent posts, we will feature the New Value opportunities. Stay tuned to our first discussion – the Green Value opportunity.

THE MODERN ROCK SHOE is often a pretty well-designed and made piece of gear. It is, after all, the only tool in the climbing kit that literally molds itself to fit the climber’s body. Just ask anyone who has dropped a shoe off the middle of a multi-pitch route, and they’ll have an opinion as to which piece of climbing gear is the most crucial! While today’s shoes have leather and stitching that can survive years of regular use, the modern sticky rubber on its sole can wear thin in months, or even weeks. This relatively new phenomenon of “hard” shoes and soft soles makes resoling a common sense alternative to replacement.
Next time you’re mid-crux, mid “moment of truth” as it were, it’s important that both you and your most crucial piece of climbing gear are up for the task. Let Bend Resole replace your rubber, so you can focus on other things, like replacing skin, chasing after moments of truth, and finding out how good you really are!

CSP developers must optimize baseload generation, solar heat production and innovative purchase contracts to gain a share of the growing mining customer market, sector experts told New Energy Update.
Mining groups are increasingly seeking renewable power contracts, lured by competitive prices and growing environmental commitments. (Image credit: Roccomontoya)
Mining companies are increasingly turning towards solar and wind power contracts, attracted by falling costs and environmental targets. Miners typically use fossil fuel power generation, either on or off-grid, and they face rising carbon reduction requirements in the coming years.
The quest for lower power costs will be the main driver of renewables demand from mining companies in the coming years, Fitch Solutions consultancy said in a report last month.
Energy costs currently account for approximately 30% of miners' balance sheet costs, and this is expected to increase "as ore reserves are depleted, forcing companies to adopt more energy-intensive mining methods," Fitch said.
While PV and wind costs have fallen much faster than CSP technology, CSP with thermal storage can provide unique benefits to mining projects.
Mining projects typically seek stable day and night power supply to optimize production, favoring CSP with storage over intermittent renewable sources, Tom Georgis, senior vice president of development at CSP developer SolarReserve, told New Energy Update.
The ideal storage capacity for a CSP plant for the mining sector would be 10 to 14 hours, Jes Donneborg, executive vice president, solar thermal development at Aalborg CSP, said. Aalborg CSP develops power and heat solutions for industry and local heating networks.
Longer storage durations are key to maximizing the competitiveness of CSP plants and most of the latest global CSP projects have incorporated large storage capacities.
Acciona's 110 MW Cerro Dominador CSP plant under construction in Chile will host 17.5 hours of storage and be joined with an operational 100 MW PV plant to provide a 24-7 hybrid solar power complex.
In U.S. and Europe, CSP developers are pursuing new high-temperature designs which should lower the cost of CSP storage and open up new market opportunities.
CSP investors typically require long-term PPAs due to the relatively high capital costs of plant construction.
Long-term PPAs also suit mining operations and the exact contract length may depend on whether the site is grid-connected or a remote "captive" customer.
SolarReserve's development pipeline in Australia includes a number of projects to supply mining and industrial customers.
The California-based company has also bid to build plants in Chile, where the mining sector is responsible for over a third of total power consumption, the highest share in the OECD, according to the International Energy Agency.
“In Chile most of the big mines are connected to the grid so we can have an initial power contract for 15 to 20 years, and then sign another PPA when it expires, or sell power on the merchant market,” he said.
For grid connected sites, CSP plants will need to be cost competitive against alternative power generation sources, such as Chile’s large coal generation stack. However, new environmental initiatives are steadily boosting the case for CSP plants.
Chile and Canada, another key mining hub, recently introduced a “carbon price” at $5/tonne and $10/tonne, respectively, Fitch noted in its report.
Remote off-grid mining operators typically use diesel-fired generation which can cost as much as $200/MWh. Remote operators may require a longer PPA to match the lifespan of the mine, potentially 20 to 30 years in duration, Georgis said.
CSP developers could use multiple PPAs to combine a number of mining sites into a multi-offtaker contract, he noted.
As demand for corporate renewable energy PPAs grows, new contract innovations are opening up the market to smaller customers. In the PV and wind sectors, energy-hungry tech groups such as Facebook and Microsoft are already acting as "anchors" for corporate PPAs, lowering risk for smaller counterparties.
Going forward, CSP plants that provide both electricity and heat supply may be the most attractive solutions for many mining companies.
The economics of concentrated solar heat (CSH) plants suit sites that requires temperatures over 100° C and those requiring 24-7 operations, and are particular attractive for those in remote locations, Christian Zahler, managing director at Industrial Solar, a CSH developer, told New Energy Update.
"Thermal energy has to be generated and used locally and the cost of large [separate] thermal storages would deteriorate the return on investment," he said.
Industrial Solar is currently developing projects in the mining sector. The company typically develops CSH plants of capacity 2 to 20 MW (thermal) and expects to sign its first CSH PPA in 2019, Zahler said.
CSH PPAs might also typically be in the 15 to 20 year range, but can be as short as seven or eight years for sites with high solar irradiation levels or high fossil fuel costs, Zahler added.
“In locations with high fossil fuel costs, such as remote locations, we expect to achieve payback in around three years, or around five for locations with average conditions,” he said.

Meet Katie, a super sweet girl who has a whole lot of enthusiasm for life. She loves to get out and explore and is a friendly and affectionate girl who is looking for the stability of a loving home. Katie has been waiting for the right family for far too long.
Katie likes to be active and loves to go for walks, go swimming and just get out and have fun. She is well suited to a country home where she will have lots of opportunities to romp and play.
Her leash manners need work when she is around other animals, especially cats. She is currently enrolled in classes to work on her manners and with the help of a number of volunteer handlers Katie is improving greatly. She is boarding at a training facility and doing really well in this environment.
Katie knows basic commands, has lovely house manners and is easy to get along with. After her exercise time is complete she'd be happy to chill out at your feet and relax, snoring away contentedly.
Katie loves attention and adores being hugged, petted, getting ear scratches, belly rubs and more. She has a lot of love to give! If you are looking for a cuddly Newf she's your gal!
Katie would very much love to live with a mild mannered dog that enjoys the occasional romp. Katie has a strong prey drive and loves to chase cats. She is not suited to a home with a cat or other small animals roaming about.
Katie came to Newf Friends on January 22/12 after her owner decided she'd be better in a home where she would have space to exercise. Katie was placed into an adoptive home but things changed with her adopters and Katie came back to Newf Friends.
Katie was born May 27, 2008 so she is 5 years old. She has been spayed and her vaccines are up to date. She's not a big girl, but she does have a lot of love to give!
Katie is being fostered in the Cookstown area. Her new family will need to pick her up in person. The typical adoption donation of $500 is reduced to $400 to offset the cost of her training needs. If you think you'd like to adopt Katie, fill out an adoption application and email it back to us. A securely fenced yard is a must for Katie and is non-negotiable - given her love of chasing cats, and electric fence will not qualify.
Nope, I'm not a Newf! I'm a gorgeous young St. Bernard that these kind Newfie people took under their wing. I'm so glad because I'm told I'll find a super family to cherish and take care of me forever. Let me tell you a bit more about myself to help you decide if I'm the girl for you.
I came to the Newfie folk on January 18, 2012 because my Momma had a whole bunch of really awful stressful things happen to her over the past few months. Terrible! Anyways, she had me since I was 6 months old (I'm 2 1/2 now), took wonderful care of me and made me into the awesome, well socialized girl that I am. She was devastated to have to let me go but the Newfie foster lady told her that she would only adopt to me to the most wonderful family. That made us both feel better.
Anywho... enough about that.. let me tell you some good stuff. I love other dogs and am great with all sizes... giant, medium and teeny tiny. I also love cats! Another favourite thing of mine? People!! I love to give big goobery kisses and receive loads of attention. I'm nice to everyone I meet, never jumping up or misbehaving. I grew up with children so I love them too and am very gentle and sweet. I would positively be over the moon if i could join a family with another dog for me to play with and kids for me to snuggle. Heaven!!
What else?? Oh oh oh, I know! I love the car! I hop right in and settle in for a drive to somewhere fun. Maybe the dog park or the beach or a hike. You name it, I'm game! I'm really good at listening to my peeps and want to please. I might need a little work with my leash skills but no worries, I'm easy to manage, especially when I'm wearing my harness. Yahooo!
When I'm the house, I'm calm. I don't really bark much or get into things that I shouldn't. I'm a just a perfect big girl and could fit in almost anywhere! I love other dogs, cats, people, kids... what a catch I am!
Now I know if you're on this website you probably like those big black hairy dogs but guess what? Newfs and Saints go together like PB&J. Check me out with fellow foster dog Rosie in the videos. We just met and we already love each other and look at us play... awesome eh?!? Us Saints are perfect playmates for Newfs. We both drool a lot, same size, love to snuggle and like to be with our people. And one more added bonus about me? I'm a smooth coat Saint! I don't require as much brushing as a Newf. What do you think of that! Foster Mom said it was great.
I am in great shape, have no health concerns and I have now been spayed. I'm 2.5 years old and weigh about 114 lbs. I'm being fostered in the Guelph Ontario area and if you're approved to adopt me you have to come and pick me up in person. An adoption donation of $500 applies. To be considered for adopting me just complete the Newf Friends adoption application (you can pretend it says Saint wherever you see Newf.)
Sweet girl Rosie is doing great in foster care. We've received loads of applications for her and will be screening this week to find her very best match. Read her bio here.

River is ready to find a home! Her follow-up x-rays look good and her treatments are now complete. She still has some weeks of rehab ahead of her, but the exercises can be done in her adoptive home. Applications are now being considered. Read about River here.
Grace here!! Well, there is so much to tell that I hardly know where to start. I will include some Christmas pictures at the end, it was a wonderful day and there was a taste of turkey at the end! I am still settling in and am learning something new everyday it seems. One big thing that I have learned is that it is NOT a good idea to take the pie off the counter while it is cooling. HOT! HOT! HOT! And it doesn’t really make anyone else happy either. I am learning to play with my new toys that Santa brought me and not steal India’s when she has picked one out of the basket. I love to take walks and play outside and they tease me as I am not really sure that I love the snow that we’ve had here. Not much yet this winter, but everyone tells me there is sure to be more. I will have Mom help me write more in a couple of months!
Her foster family included two young boys, and although she lived with them only three weeks, the 160 pound Newfoundland dog took her role in the household seriously.
"She would wander into my boys' room and look them over as if to say goodnight," said foster mom, Sarah. "And as soon as she got up, she would run in to check on them."
Zoe was rescued in northern Ontario after a volunteer with Newf Friends Newfoundland Dog Rescue heard about her situation. But, despite the efforts of some volunteers, several months passed before Zoe was surrendered.
"We were aware there was a Newf in need and had extended the offer to help, but the family didn't follow up," said Sandra, founder of Newf Friends.
Eventually she was surrendered. When that happened, Sandra looked to her volunteers to help transport Zoe to southern Ontario.
"Doing transports is extremely time consuming, trying to sort out who's going to meet the dog, finding volunteers who are all available on the same day," she said. "If someone's late it may throw the transport off. It's one of the more challenging aspects of the process."
Zoe's journey was certainly a challenge. It took five people more than 12 hours to transport Zoe to her final foster home.
When she embarked on her journey, Zoe was shy, suffered skin issues and had an ear infection. But it wasn't difficult to see, despite the hardship she'd faced and her haggard appearance, Zoe was a gentle soul.
After half a day on the road with different Newf Friends volunteers, Zoe arrived in southern Ontario and met Sarah for the first time.
"My first impression was she was pretty reserved, but still as sweet as they come," said Sarah, who works at an animal shelter and regularly fosters dogs and cats.
"After we dropped the boys off at school, she was fine. She just leaned on us and watched through the fence," she said. "You could tell she was a little out of her comfort zone but nothing negative."
Next up, a visit to some local pet stores. Zoe couldn't walk in the door at first - she was petrified of a bird squawking inside. So they stood outside and absorbed the environment.
"She was the most well-behaved dog you'd ever meet in your life," said Sarah, who has three cats and two dogs of her own. "Once we did the trick-or-treating she soared."
Through three weeks of fostering, Sarah took Zoe everywhere with her. And when it was finally time to say goodbye, the timid Newfoundland had gained confidence and healed.
"I took her to the pet stores a couple weeks later and she walked right in the door. It shows we just needed to show her the world," she said.
While letting go of Zoe was particularly difficult, Sarah said she has to think about why she fosters.
"I always remind myself it's not about me. It's about the animals," she said. "I'd rather feel sad and help, than not do anything."
It's hard to believe a full year has gone by, since Charlie came to our home.As I write this email,Charlie is fast asleep beside me on the sofa while the fireplace warms the room. A typical night other than Sophie (our golden) is usually cuddled up as well. She's decided to call it a night and is currently sleeping on our bed. They had a good run today when we took them for a hike with their buddy Bear,our friends' Bernese Mountain Dog.
Charlie has been such a great dog! He has been easy to train and knows all his basic commands. The hardest one was "down" as he kept trying to give me his paw (newf joke I suspect).He finally understood the hand signal after some work,which wasn't long, as Charlie is veryyyyyy food motivated. Friends by the dozen he has made this year, four and two footed,because of his gentle personality. Even my parents joked at Christmas that if we just happened to leave him behind at their place, we could visit him often.
He LOVES being touched,brushed,stroked! The first time he went to the groomer, he didn't even wait for the table to be lowered, he just hopped up waiting patiently to be brushed.The groomer said she had never seen anything like it.
His first Christmas was special. He was able to meet some of our extended family for the first time. They loved him! Christmas dinner was a fabulous night with 19 people and 5 dogs,including Sophie and Charlie. He fit our dog crazy family like a glove and was showered with attention,which he lapped up.
The best thing is that Sophie and Charlie have become the best of friends. I spent many a summer nights this past year sitting on the deck watching them play together, which was so entertaining. Their nicknames are now frick and frack as they have become truly inseparable.
Charlie is our third dog, but our first rescue and as this has been such a positive experience for us, we have decided to adopt only rescues from now on.

If you are thinking about adding a Newf to your family there are several things to consider. Due to their size, grooming needs, exercise needs, social needs and tendency to leave slobber everywhere they go, Newfoundland Dogs are not the right breed for every family. Before adopting a Newf, time should be spent researching the breed to ensure that a Newf is the right dog for you.
You can visit this breed info page to learn more about Newfoundland Dogs before deciding if adding a Newf to your family is a good decision.
Hypnotherapy is a healing technique using hypnosis. It works to overcome destructive and undesirable behaviours and patterns to create lasting change. Deep relaxation, that is a normal healthy state of mind and distraction of the conscious mind are used during hypnotherapy. Deep relaxation is the feeling experienced before drifting off to sleep.
Occurring in an induced, calm state with specific, detailed, and realistic suggestions being given to imagine, remember, create, and respond positively, promotes health and wellbeing. During the process, the conscious, analytical mind gets to have a rest and physical, emotional and mental relaxation is encouraged. Dr Milton Erikson, a leading American hypnotherapist, described the process of hypnosis as “a free period in which individuality can flourish”, as the unconscious mind is reprogrammed through positive suggestions and heightened awareness, to choose more healthy options through the use of the imagination. Thoughts or images are imaged as being real to move the mind to a more healthy state of being.
Unhealthy habits, beliefs, compulsions, behaviours, thoughts and emotions are able to be broken with desired, fresh images replacing patterns that interfere with a productive, happy life. A plan to ensure this happens with be set up in consultation with the therapist.

I started this enterprise back in April as an experiment. I work at various levels - academic papers, teaching, textbooks - and I learn something in each medium that I can use in the others. I saw other people writing blogs and thought: Why not? What do I have to lose? Some people I talk to worry that this will burn up a lot of time, but I find it doesn't. It's actually useful discipline for me, that forces me to pick up institutional details and facts about data that I otherwise would be too lazy to spend time on. If no one else is learning anything, at least I am. As Neil Young said once (or something like this - you can find this somewhere in your blu ray Neil Young Archives): "I do this for me. F*** the audience." Actually, that's not really true. I do care what you think.
Now, sometimes this is a tough business. I have opinions, or I wouldn't do this. I've aired plenty of those opinions in public outside of the blogosphere without much adverse reaction, but apparently there is a segment of the blogosphere where opinions like this are seen as the equivalent of attacking someone's religion. My friend Kartik Athreya certainly suffered for posting something on his personal web site suggesting that economic research published in traditional venues might be somehow superior to a typical blog entry. I would characterize most of the reaction as bullying. I can see why people who write blogs would be upset that someone would express disdain for what they do, and I understand that the freewheeling and democratic nature of the blogosphere is refreshing. However, most assistant professors in serious research universities who are worried about getting tenure are not going to learn their economics from blogs. I would not counsel my graduate students to devote any of their precious time to reading blogs. Kartik's opinions are not unique. I think they are widely held in academia, though of course I have not taken a poll.
Yesterday I was feeling a little down about this whole enterprise, but I think I feel better this morning. What makes me feel bad is perhaps surprising. While one might think that free entry into blogging would produce a plethora of opinions and freewheeling exchange of ideas, the outcome is actually rather monolithic and intolerant, at least in terms of what I see in the macroeconomics blogosphere. The blog readers I find to be fair, for the most part (though people drop occasional turds in my comment box), but the blog writers (at least the guys with the big audiences) are prone to exaggeration, ideological rigidity, and misrepresentation of positions they oppose. I feel that it's not fair to pick on people who aren't endowed with some power. For me, Woodford (I know him well and he is a nice guy and has a sense of humor), Kocherlakota (a good friend - he's not going to take my criticism personally), and certainly Krugman (never met the guy, and I'm sure he doesn't give a hoot what I say about him) are fair game. Picking on some poor guy working at the Richmond Fed who is relatively unknown outside of the macro conference circuit and the group of scholars working on bankruptcy is not really fair.
Anyway, to get to the point, here's my game plan from now on. What I'm shooting for here is more Neil Young (old, irreverent, maybe a little sloppy, but aiming for integrity, with a Canadian lack of pedigree) than Lady Gaga. I don't want a large audience, as that would mean going for the Macro 101 Keynesian-Cross approach of most of the macro blogosphere. Trying to keep Krugman honest is obviously a waste of time. Krugman's blog writing and his recent NYT columns are like Fox News or organized religion. It's either obvious to you what its faults are, or you are committed to it, and I'm not going to change your mind.
One last point. Where are the women in the macro blogosphere? All the bloggers are men, and any non-anonymous commenters I get are also male. Look at the pictures of my followers - a bunch of men except for the Canada Goose. There has to be something wrong if we're scaring the women off. Obviously too much aggression is floating around.
The Fed conducted its first auction of funds through its new term deposit facility on Monday, as described here. Recall that the term deposit facility allows banks with reserve accounts to effectively tie up reserve funds in an account that cannot be used in intraday transactions and cannot count towards overnight reserve requirements. The idea, as I have discussed before (though I couldn't find the relevant blog piece) is that this promotes inflation control by somehow tying up reserves so that they cannot "escape." I have also argued that this is misguided - the Fed can achieve all the inflation control it needs, and at lower cost, by setting the interest rate on reserves appropriately.
Now, what happened in the auction? $2 billion in 28-day term deposits were offered, and an amount greater than $11 billion was the amount tendered. I have no idea how an auction like this might go, but this looks like healthy demand, though of course you would have to see all the prices that were associated with the $11 billion quantity to determine that. The "stop out rate" was 0.27%, which is the lowest accepted bid rate. Since the interest rate on reserves is currently 0.25%, the Fed does not have to pay much of a premium to get a bank to commit to locking up reserves for 28 days. Of course this is due to the fact that there is a huge quantity of reserves in the system, so a marginal unit of reserves has close to zero value in making intraday transactions or in satisfying reserve requirements. Thus, these term deposits are not costing the Fed much more than liquid reserves, though presumably it costs something to run the auction. One would expect though, that as the quantity of reserves falls, the margin between the term deposit rate and the interest rate on reserves will rise.
In a previous post, I gave Narayana Kocherlakota a hard time about his stand on New Keynesian economics. A couple of commenters characterized this as unnecessarily vitriolic and personal. Of course it was personal. I have an enormous amount of respect for Narayana, but he is a public figure now, with some influence on public policy in this country, and I expect a lot from him. I have said nice things about him before (see this piece), but if I disagree with what he says, I think I should say so. Economists need thick skins to survive, and I can assure you that Narayana has one as well.
Now, some of you seem to think, like Narayana, that New Keynesian economics is coherent. A while back I took the time to study what New Keynesians were doing. This research program was getting a lot of attention, and I wanted to see if there was something to it. I came to the conclusion that New Keynesian Economics had nothing to offer in its current form, and since then I have taken the opportunity to criticize this stuff whenever the opportunity arises. Here are some critical pieces I have written (two of these with Randy Wright, which also provide a constructive alternative):
What is incoherent about New Keynesian Economics? As represented in Woodford's "Interest and Prices," the paradigm has the following problems, among others:
1. Firms whose prices are "stuck" in the current period behave suboptimally, and in ways that drive all of the results.
2. These models are stated to be immune from the Lucas Critique, but for a number of reasons (e.g. fixed decision rules for price-setting) they are not.
3. The framework is supposed to be about analyzing monetary policy, but does not contain the most basic elements of what monetary policy is about, i.e. the quantities on the central bank's balance sheet. Recent work by Curdia and Woodford tries to correct this problem, but in a somewhat pathetic way.
Some people wondered what I meant by the current predictions of New Keynesian models being laughable. I'm not sure why this was not obvious. The example I gave, which is typical, was of a New Keynesian model that was currently predicting that the nominal interest rate should be less than -5%. What would you think if I offered up a model that predicted that the unemployment rate should be -5%, and tried to interpret this in terms of what policymakers should actually do? Should you take me seriously? Of course not. We all know that arbitrage dictates that "the" nominal interest rate cannot fall below zero. The zero lower bound should be in the model, as should "quantitative easing," if we think that is important.
In my comment in reply to a commenter to "Kocherlakota Sells Out," I mentioned that I wasn't currently concerned about the unemployment rate, which of course drew the reaction that I was insensitive to the plight of the poor. As I have pointed out in a number of previous posts, I think that the US economy is recovering nicely. However, the behavior of the labor market and productivity is unusual. My conjecture, based on readily available aggregate observations and nothing more, is that this unusual behavior (including the high unemployment rate) is due to sectoral reallocation in the United States, away from manufacturing and housing, and toward services, and within the manufacturing sector. As such, there is little the government can do about it, except to wait for the reallocation to work itself out, and ease the transition with relatively generous unemployment insurance benefits.
I just returned from Shanghai China where, as it turns out, one cannot access Google blog sites, which explains why I have been silent for a while. While there I learned a little more about the financial system in China, and have some things to say about recent issues related to China’s exchange rate policy and US deficits.
The savings rate in China is very high, and much of the high quantity of savings is accounted for by households. Financial institutions in China are not well-developed, with the banking system dominated by state-owned banks which lend on favorable terms to state-owned enterprises but give short shrift to private firms. There are significant barriers to entry for foreign banks, which account for about 2% or 3% of market share. A significant fraction of Chinese savings gets channeled through Chinese financial institutions into US Treasury securities, thus lowering rates of return on those securities. US (and other) firms, looking for high rates of return, invest directly in China, so some of the savings which exits China comes back as foreign investment. However, given the obstacles to foreign investment in China, there are plenty of would-be high-return projects that go without funding. The phenomenon of high savings in China creating a Chinese current account surplus and driving down real rates of interest in the world is sometimes called a “savings glut” (Bernanke coined this term I think). However, it is more useful to think of this as being associated with an underdeveloped, indeed an obstructed, Chinese financial system, which does not efficiently channel savings into investment.
Now, for a long time, Americans have been bashing China over its exchange rate policy. The idea seems to be that the nominal exchange rate is “artificially low” or “undervalued,” so that China is somehow forcing us to buy its goods at too low a price. In the meantime, as the argument goes, the Chinese are being far too frugal, in the process making our interest rates so low that our housing market goes crazy and causes us to go into a panic. Something should be done. After a long period of whining from the United States, China finally changed its exchange rate policy, but of course that’s still not good enough for our friend Paul Krugman.
What China does with its nominal exchange rate is of minor importance for the issues at hand here. Consider the following. Suppose that China had allowed its financial system to develop like its manufacturing sector. This would have involved a relaxation of barriers to starting up private banks and of restrictions on the activities of foreign financial institutions in China (to create a stable financial system, the Chinese would of course had to establish appropriate regulations to prevent excessive risk-taking). What would the result have been? Domestic savings in China would have been channeled into domestic investment in China, investment would have been much higher, and the current account surplus would have been much lower. Indeed, with a large enough investment boom in China, there would be a Chinese current account deficit currently, and the world real interest rate would be much higher.
What would things have looked like in the United States? Our government would be paying much higher interest rates on its debt and running a higher deficit, and foreigners might be thinking a lot harder about whether it was a good idea to lend to our government. We would also be running a current account surplus and working a lot harder to send goods off to China as inputs into their investment projects. Do you think we would like that world better than the one we are currently living in? Maybe Krugman would think we had struck the appropriate balance, but I think most of us in the United States would think that we were worse off.
In the middle of an otherwise innocuous educational piece, Narayana Kocherlakota, President of the Minneapolis Fed, in discussing "successes" in macroeconomic modeling, has a section on "Pricing Frictions: The New Keynesian Synthesis." Here is Narayana's description of how the "real world" works:
If the Federal Reserve injects a lot of money into the economy, then there is more money chasing fewer goods. This extra money puts upward pressure on prices. If all firms changed prices continuously, then this upward pressure would manifest itself in an immediate jump in the price level. But this immediate jump would have little effect on the economy. Essentially, such a change would be like a simple change of units (akin to recalculating distances in inches instead of feet).
In the real world, though, firms change prices only infrequently. It is impossible for the increase in money to generate an immediate jump in the price level. Instead, since most prices remain fixed, the extra money generates more demand on the part of households and in that way generates more production. Eventually, prices adjust, and these effects on demand and production vanish. But infrequent price adjustment means that monetary policy can have short-run effects on real output.
This is a more-or-less mainstream textbook description of how the Keynesian "transmission mechanism" works in some kind of IS-LM, AD-AS model, or (as of course is no accident) the so-called "microfounded" version in Woodford's Interest and Prices, or Clarida, Gali, and Gertler's survey piece in the Journal of Economic Literature.
For me, this was more than a little puzzling, as the Narayana I knew would have thought the worldview represented in standard Keynesian economics was hopelessly naive. But read on, it gets better (or worse, depending on whether you want a good chuckle or actually care about the state of policymaking in the world). We then get this:
Because of these considerations, many modern macro models are centered on infrequent price and wage adjustments. These models are often called sticky price or New Keynesian models. They provide a foundation for a coherent normative and positive analysis of monetary policy in the face of shocks. This analysis has led to new and important insights. It is true that, as in the models of the 1960s and 1970s, monetary policymakers in New Keynesian models are trying to minimize output gaps without generating too much volatility in inflation. However, in the models of the 1960s and 1970s, output gap refers to the deviation between observed output and some measure of potential output that is growing at a roughly constant rate. In contrast, in modern sticky price models, output gap refers to the deviations between observed output and efficient output. The modern models specifically allow for the possibility that efficient output may move down in response to adverse shocks. This difference in formulation can lead to strikingly different policy implications.
1. "...a foundation for a coherent normative and positive analysis..." No way. Woodford's view of the world is not coherent, and it certainly isn't a normative theory - the Taylor rule has never been shown to be an optimal response to anything. Also forget the "positive analysis." One would think that New Keynesians would be thoroughly embarrassed by the financial crisis, which obviously has nothing to do with sticky prices, and left them at a loss for policy prescriptions. What is most laughable are the attempts of people like this to make sense out of estimated Taylor rules that predict (very) negative nominal interest rates currently.
2. "This analysis has lead to new and important insights." First, there is nothing new in New Keynesian economics, which is successful in good part because it is completely unobjectionable to (i.e. the same as) Old Keynesian economics. Some people might tell you that it's forward looking price-setting that makes the difference, but I don't buy it. Second, New Keynesian economics leaves me empty. There is nothing "important" going on there.
3. As implemented by policymakers, there is absolutely no difference in the old notion of the output gap and the new one. It may be the case that, in Woodford's "Interest and Prices," the core model is essentially a monopolistic-competition real-business-cycle framework, and the output gap is clearly defined as the difference between what output is, and what it would be with flexible prices. In practice, take a look at how Glenn Rudebusch does it here. Rudebusch's output gap is the difference between the unemployment rate and the CBO's measure of the natural rate. But that seems to come from this paper, where the natural rate is
the unemployment rate that arises from all sources other than fluctuations in demand associated with business cycles.
This is basically an Old Keynesian natural rate, and if you look at the time series for the natural rate in the paper, it's clear that it will not differ much from what you get from fitting something like an HP filter to the unemployment rate series. So much for progress.
However you look at this, it's not good. Narayana either believes these things, or he doesn't. If he does, too bad for us. If not, maybe this sells well with some people but, again, too bad for us.
The April employment report from the BLS seems to have been greeted widely as shockingly bad news. For example, see this story. Here's the key paragraph, which is representative of the viewpoint you will see almost everywhere:
The headline numbers for May suggested reason for optimism — employers added 431,000 jobs and the jobless rate fell to 9.7 percent, from 9.9 percent in April. But the underlying numbers showed that almost all of the growth came from the 411,000 workers hired by the federal government to help with the Census. Most of those jobs will end in a few months.
Now, I'm not sure exactly what numbers are being used here. The news reports focus on seasonally adjusted establishment survey numbers. The increase of 431,000 is in seasonally adjusted payroll employment from March to April. However, I'm not sure whether the 411,000 workers hired to do the census is a raw number or a seasonally adjusted number, or whether it is coming directly from the federal government or from the establishment survey. Indeed, in the seasonally unadjusted data, the change in federal employment from March to April was (guess what?) 411,000. If we look at the unadjusted data, the total gain in employment from March to April is 1,090,000, of which 711,000 is coming from the private sector and 379,000 from the government.
This is now beginning to look somewhat better for the private sector, but of course private sector employment tends to grow at a high rate in the spring, coming off its low point in January. It's clearly important to account for seasonal variation in some manner. However, let's forget the above numbers for the time being and focus on year-over-year percentage changes in establishment survey employment, and see what that tells us. I have provided the chart.
Now, I don't see any reason for pessimism in this picture. Year-over-year employment growth is increasing at a very rapid rate currently, and there is a lot more strength than was the case after the last recession. While government employment has increased 3.3% (April 2009 to April 2010), government employment is currently 17.8% of the total, so most of the strength in the employment picture is coming from the private sector.
You can find an interesting contrast between a policy paper written by Narayana Kocherlakota, Minneapolis Fed President, and a speech by Jeff Lacker, the Richmond Fed President. Narayana thinks that the financial sector is fraught with externalities. For example:
It is important to distinguish my notion of a risk externality from two other types of externalities that are mentioned in discussions of bank regulation. One of these is a systemic externality. The failure of a given Bank X may affect the profitability of many other firms in the economy even though Bank X has no direct contracts with those firms. In this sense, any decision by Bank X that increases its probability of failure has a systemic implication, because it also increases the expected losses by the entire financial—and indeed economic—system.2
My notion of a risk externality is also distinct from what might be termed a fire sale externality. During financial crises, many financial institutions may have to sell assets or collateral at the same time. These simultaneous sales will put downward pressures on the assets’ prices. A given financial institution will not internalize the impact of its sales on the price of other institutions’ assets.
According to Kocherlakota, then, there are three important externalities, a risk externality (the primary focus of his paper), a systemic externality, and a fire sale externality. Now, let's turn to Lacker, who says:
First, I am skeptical of the characterization of systemic risk as an externality that leads market participants to undervalue or ignore risks. Those spillovers are usually ascribed to the interconnectedness that is said to be more prevalent among financial firms. But those interconnections are all the result of mutually agreed-upon contracts. Creditors have voluntarily chosen their counterparties, and they have no inherent reason to neglect the implied exposure to their counterparties' counterparties. Similarly, financial asset owners have voluntarily agreed to a range of potential returns, and they have no inherent reason to neglect any particular possibilities. Interconnectedness, by itself, is not a market failure.
Skepticism is also warranted, I believe, regarding the systemic consequences of an individual firm's failure, no matter how interconnected. Arguments that one firm's failure can spark costly runs at other firms rely on the logic of panics as self-fulfilling prophecies. While this logic is correct as far as it goes, it provides an unsatisfactory guide for policymakers, because it does not provide a means for determining whether creditors are justified in pulling away from other firms. After all, news that one firm has failed can be genuinely informative about fundamental prospects at other firms with similar exposures.
I do think there is a fundamental deficiency in the way our financial markets have performed. And you could describe this deficiency as an externality that leads both to the overexposure to risks in the financial system and to contagious reactions of markets to problems at one institution. But this externality is the product of government policy — namely, the provision of government protection to creditors through an ambiguous, implicit financial safety net. The widespread belief that some financial firms are too big or too "systemically important" to fail and their creditors will benefit from government support increases those firms' appetite for risk. In this setting, allowing a firm to fail creates contagion by forcing market participants to adjust their beliefs about the extent of future government protection.
Now, since Kocherlakota sees the financial crisis as in part an externality problem, this gets him thinking about how we can use standard Pigouvian taxation to solve the problem. There's nothing new about that of course. For example, some of the IMF's taxation proposals (see my piece here) have that flavor.
Kocherlakota's idea is the following. Large financial institutions understand that they are too big to fail, and that they will inevitably be bailed out in a crisis. We would like to prevent these large financial institutions from taking on a level of risk that is in excess of what is socially optimal. However, monitoring what these financial institutions are up to is difficult and costly. Why not let the market help this solution along, much like a cap-and-trade arrangement for a pollution externality? Kocherlakota proposes a solution, somewhat reminiscent of Charlie Calomiris's subordinated debt proposal (see here), described as follows:
Here’s what I have in mind. Suppose that, for every relevant financial institution, the government issues a “rescue bond.” The rescue bond pays a variable coupon equal to 1/1,000 of the transfers actually made from the taxpayer to the financial institution or its stakeholders. (I pick 1/1,000 out of the air; any fixed fraction will do.) Much of the time, this coupon will be zero. However, just like the financial institution’s stakeholders, the owners of the rescue bond will occasionally receive a large payment. In theory, or in a perfectly functioning market, the price of this bond is exactly equal to the 1/1,000 of the expected discounted value of the transfers to the financial institution’s stakeholders. Thus, the government should charge the financial institution a tax equal to 1,000 times the price of the bond.
Well, that seems appealing, but doomed to failure I think. As I discussed here, a key problem in the financial crisis was that assets were not correctly priced. If we can't price mortgage-backed securities, we do not have the ability to price rescue bonds correctly either. Further, the approach appears to warrant that the payoffs on the rescue bonds should include all of the benefits that financial institutions receive from the government. How do we account for the effects of monetary policy on asset prices, which could benefit banks and other financial intermediaries? What about the benefits from access to the discount window? Conclusion: There is no cheap fix here - you just have to bear the pain of figuring out how to correctly regulate the financial institutions. But if Canadians can do it right, we can too. I like this quote from Lacker's speech:
A compelling alternative premise, one that I personally believe is most likely to emerge as the consensus assessment among future scholars, is that the incentives created by the financial safety net were the chief cause of the financial crisis. Richmond Fed economists have conservatively estimated that in 1999, 18 percent of the U.S. financial sector was covered, or believed to be covered, by the implicit safety net.5 Another 27 percent received explicit protection such as deposit insurance, meaning that a total of 45 percent of financial sector liabilities benefited from explicit or implicit government safety net support. The implicit coverage was accounted for almost entirely by the housing government sponsored entities (GSEs) and several large commercial banks — all of which were important players in the build-up of risks related to housing finance over the last decade.
The Bank of Canada announced a reconfiguration in its monetary policy stance. In case you do not know the institutional setup, the Bank of Canada lends at the "Bank Rate," roughly equivalent to the discount rate, and accepts deposits at the "deposit rate," the equivalent of the interest rate on reserves (IROR) in the US. The policy target rate is the overnight rate. For some time now, the Bank of Canada has set the target overnight rate at 0.25%, and the deposit rate was also 0.25%. The Bank Rate was 0.5%. Consistent with that, the Bank had aimed to have a positive quantity of reserves in the system overnight (a significant quantity, but modest by current Fed standards). The change in policy is the following. The deposit rate stays at 0.25%, the target overnight rate increases to 0.5%, and the Bank Rate is now set at 0.75%. The relationship among the three rates is identical to what it was pre-financial crisis, i.e. the Bank Rate is the target rate plus 25 basis points; the deposit rate is the target rate minus 25 basis points.
Given that the Fed is now in a regime where it pays interest on reserves, it is useful to pay attention to how the Bank of Canada conducts policy - they have been doing this for a long time now (and with no reserve requirements as well). What the Bank understands is that, if they want a positive quantity of reserves in the system overnight, the target rate has to be equal to the deposit rate. In the US, the fed funds rate can be lower than the IROR because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do not earn interest on their reserve accounts with the Fed, and there is some friction (which nobody seems to understand completely, as far as I know) which inhibits arbitrage. As I have said in the past, the relevant policy rate in the US currently is the IROR, given the positive quantity of excess reserves in the system.
The Bank of Canada has an inflation target of 2% per annum, which they appear to be concerned about. If you read their description of the state of the Canadian economy here, they are New Keynesian Taylor Rule policymakers - they care about output gaps. Note that the recession in Canada looks broadly similar to the US one, in terms of the path followed by GDP - their last couple of GDP numbers came in quite strong. However, the labor market picture is different - for example the unemployment rate is considerably lower than in the US (by the way, I couldn't find conveniently accessible Canadian data, other than downloading from the StatCan site - can anyone help me?), and on average it is usually higher (due to differences in unemployment insurance for example). Canada also has a somewhat booming housing market - very different from here of course. Their resource sector (commodity price fluctuations aside) seems to be looking quite good as well.

I was able to learn a lot more about Ole Miss from their first game than I was from MS State. It’s not that State didn’t play well, they did fine. No the problem was the opponent. Southern Miss was just so bad, I have no idea how good MS State really is, and I don’t expect the next two opponents to show much either. I guess I’ll just have to wait till the LSU game to know what MSU is working with and toward this year.
I guess on the positive side, they’ll get 3 games to work out the kinks before being tested. One the negative side, they may get lazy or complacent after 3 easy games.
The most conservative, Old Order groups of these reclusive, religious people drive horses and buggies rather than cars. Many have no telephones or electricity in their homes.
They eschew technology and preach isolation from the modern world. They do not join the military or accept assistance from the government.
The Amish community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania was a model for the 1985 film Witness starring Harrison Ford, a thriller which contrasted the violent modern world with their peaceful existence.
The oldest group of Old Order Amish, about 16,000-18,000 people, live in Lancaster County, a rural, farming area where Amish first settled in the 1720s - many fleeing religious persecution in Europe.
The Amish are divided into dozens of separate fellowships, broken down into districts or congregations. Each district is fully independent and lives by its own set of unwritten rules, or Ordnung.
The Old Order are the most conservative of these groups, and observe strict regulations on dress, behaviour, and the use of technology, which they believe encourages humility and separation from the world.
Old Order Amish women wear modest dresses with long sleeves and a full skirt, a cape and an apron. They never cut their hair, but wear it in a bun on the back of the head.
Men and boys wear dark-coloured suits, straight-cut coats and black or straw broad-brimmed hats. They grow beards only after they marry.
Modern technology is not rejected out of hand. Some farms have telephones and local groups can allow electricity to be used in certain circumstances.
Most Amish are trilingual. They speak a dialect of German called Pennsylvania Dutch at home, use High German at their worship services, and they learn English at school.
In some ways, the Amish are feeling the pressures of the modern world. Commentators say child labour laws, for example, are threatening long-established ways of life.
While many Amish own firearms, used to hunt and kill wild animals, their communities have until now been largely free of violent gun crime.
FORT MYERS, Florida -- A 19-year-old Florida man rode a whale shark in the Gulf of Mexico last week and posted the video on You Tube.
Although not illegal, Chris Kreis told NBC-2 that he "would jump in if I saw one again, but next time I wouldn't touch the fish."
Whale sharks are the biggest fish in the ocean. They can grow to 50 feet, weigh 40 tons, and live up to 100 years. The filter-feeders are commonly affable and allow divers to interact with them, according to NOAA.
Although Florida is well known for thrilling rides at its theme park, harassing marine animals have become an impromptu amusement lately in the Sunshine State. Last month, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission opened an investigation after video of a man cannon balling on a manatee in Cocoa Beach, Florida surfaced on Facebook.
In another incident, a Fort Pierce, Florida man was arrested for allegedly harassing or disturbing a manatee calf in Taylor Creek in St. Lucie County back in in January after photos of him hugging the sea cow were posted on Facebook.
Last September, a woman was photographed riding a manatee at Fort DeSoto Park in Pinellas County, Florida. The woman contacted the Pinellas County Sheriff's department after the photos were made the news, but was not immediately arrested because authorities said it was an arrestable offense since the manatee harassment did not occur in a deputy’s presence. She was later arrested and charged in November 2012.
But on a lighter note, a Florida lifeguard actually saved a beached shark by pulling it back into the Atlantic Ocean with his bare hands in May.

Congo has approved the use of four more experimental treatments in the Ebola virus outbreak in its northeast, as health officials try to contain the spread amid the threat from armed groups in the region.
The treatments ZMapp, Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Regn3450 – 3471 – 3479 can now can be used on those suffering from Ebola, the health ministry said Wednesday. On Tuesday, health officials administered Remdesivir to a patient in Beni, the ministry said.
Health officials began using the first experimental treatment — mAb114 — on 10 patients on Aug. 11. The ministry said they were doing well.

Congo's tenth Ebola outbreak was declared in Mangina in North Kivu province on Aug. 1. So far there are 75 confirmed Ebola cases and 27 probable ones. Of the 59 deaths, 32 have been confirmed as Ebola, according to the health ministry.
More than 1,600 people have been vaccinated since Aug. 8 in Mabalako and Beni in North Kivu province and in Mandima in Ituri province, the ministry said.
Insecurity in the region, especially in what the World Health Organization calls "red zones" where several armed groups stage attacks, is hampering efforts to treat everyone.
North Kivu is densely populated with more than 1 million displaced people. Health officials say the local population near the heavily travelled border with Uganda is not familiar with the disease, making outreach important.
Ebola is spread via contact with bodily fluids of those infected, including the dead, and can be fatal in up to 90 per cent of cases, depending on the strain.

That’s why it’s no surprise that searching for iPhone price comparisons is a very popular search query.

The tax would have cost Amazon about $800 per employee, or 0.7% of their average salary.[202] In retaliation, Amazon paused construction on a new building, threatened to limit further investment in the city, and funded a repeal campaign. Although originally passed, the measure was soon repealed after an expensive repeal campaign spearheaded by Amazon.[203]
You're here! That means you either love finding a good deal or maybe just need a mindless distraction from work. Either way, we're here to help. We don't just show you the first handful of sales we see when we log in to Amazon. Anyone can do that! What we do, instead, is dive deep into Amazon, hunting for sales on products and services we know for sure are worth your hard-earned money. Why? Because we've all gone to buy something online that sounds perfect only to have it turn up broken, be 5 times smaller than expected, or just not do what it promised. No one deserves that, so we use our in-house expertise, hands-on experience, and deal-hunting skills to sort out which sales are actually worth your time.

Sous vide is a style of cooking that immerses food in a hot water bath that is heated to the exact ideal temperature of the food being cooked. This allows the food to cook evenly without any risk of over- or undercooking it. As someone who basically cannot cook chicken by herself, I can make a gourmet-quality chicken breast or a steakhouse style steak with next to no effort.
To avoid copyright violations, Amazon does not return the computer-readable text of the book. Instead, it returns a picture of the matching page, instructs the web browser to disable printing and puts limits on the number of pages in a book a single user can access. Additionally, customers can purchase online access to some of the same books via the "Amazon Upgrade" program.[citation needed]
On Amazon, the basic search lets you filter returns on the left side-rail by product specifications, brands and reviews. Once you start to narrow your search, you can define it further by price and discount. The fewer restrictions you put on your search, the higher the number of returns. For example, many people mistakenly only search for items with “Free Shipping”, which could exclude better deals.
In 1999, Amazon first attempted to enter the publishing business by buying a defunct imprint, "Weathervane", and publishing some books "selected with no apparent thought", according to The New Yorker. The imprint quickly vanished again, and as of 2014 Amazon representatives said that they had never heard of it.[37] Also in 1999, Time magazine named Bezos the Person of the Year when it recognized the company's success in popularizing online shopping.[38]
Apple iPhone and Samsung Galaxy Smartphone Deals - Last year, Best Buy offered savings up to $200 with qualified activation on the Apple iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (review deal). It also offered $300 off on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S8 Plus with qualified activation (review deal). Amazon rarely mentions iPhone and Galaxy phone prices in its initial announcement, while Best Buy always puts its iPhone and Galaxy phone deals front and center.
Tablets are super portable, making them great to do check emails, do school work, or play games on-the-go. Right now, Prime members can get $40 off the Fire HD 10 Tablet, which has a great display and Alexa built-in, making it easier than ever to pause videos and open other apps. This is $10 more than the lowest price we've ever seen for this model and we can expect this price again around Black Friday. But if you've wanted a tablet for work or school for some time now, we still think it's a great buy.
What’s great is the ability to search for exactly what you want instead of wasting your time scrolling through a list of deals. You can also search by category. Each one has a separate webpage with multiple tabs - including tabs listing special offers, coupons and markdowns taken off the already discounted outlet price! Just keep in mind, this may not be the best the price on Amazon. A search for digital cameras pulled up good deals on both Amazon and Amazon Outlet.
Apple iPhone Deals - Expect Best Buy to announce several different iPhone deals in its Black Friday ad scan. I predict the main deal will be a saving of up to $200 on the Apple iPhone XR with Qualified Activation. If it offers iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max deals, it will likely be $0 down and a free gift card valued at up to $300 with Qualified Activation. Amazon won’t be able to match these gift cards and will instead have modest discounts of 5-8% when you buy the phone outright.
For ecommerce merchants, comparison shopping engines are an opportunity to put your products in front of very interested buyers. These are not people glancing at a virtual storefront like a window shopper at the mall. Rather, CSE users typically have already made the decision to buy and are simply looking for the best deal. With their high-intent to purchase, comparison shoppers are often an ideal audience for promoting your products.
9 profitable intra-day forex trading strategies you can use right now! They identify best forex traders strategies in teaching-day trading strategies that are tried, tested. They stick to a strict money management regime.
How do I find intra-day trading strategies that actually work? And Are there some day trading rules that will help me to trade forex, commodities, stocks? All you need to do is: set aside a few minutes of your day to tackle one of the following forex day trading strategies which I outline for you below. That’s the uncomfortable fact of life that marketers don’t like to speak of! And those few people are most probably trading with other peoples money, like traders working for a bank or a hedge fund.
That means the stakes are not as high for them, as they are for a person trading their own capital. There are intra-day trading strategies beginners can use to maximise their chances to stay in the game for the long haul. These can be use in most markets like forex, commodities or stocks. Awesome forex day trading strategies that are used successfully every day. The main chart patterns associated with these forex trading strategies.
How to manage your trading risk to stay in the game for the long haul. 1 The strategy seeks trading opportunities through the combination of fundamental and technical analysis. 2 It requires a trader to analyse the fundamental aspects of the traded currency to establish mid to long term trend first. Then it uses the price momentum, support and a resistance zones to spot market reversals. 3 The strategy allows to enter the market at low risk and provide a large profit potential through advanced money management.
4 All trades are planned in advance to give a trader enough time to enter the market every time. Most trades are placed as pending limit orders often executed during London’s session. 5 The strategy works well on all major US Dollar crosses. It generates between 1-5 signals per month. All trades are entered and held for anything up to several weeks depending on the price action and the market fundamentals. After establishing your bias and long term trend through Commitments of Traders report, it’s time to switch to daily charts and look for a price reversal phase. Has the market been clearly falling or rallying recently?
Is the weekly and daily stochastic showing overbought or oversold levels on daily charts? Is the price trading around major support or resistance zones? In the USDJPY chart above you can see four examples of the price being in a reversal phase. Weekly and daily stochastics are above 70 zone and the market has been in a substantial rally prior to that.
A trader should be marking this zone as bearish and switching to intraday charts to seek a bearish reversal price pattern. A trader will be marking this area as bearish and switching to intraday charts to seek a bearish reversal price pattern. Once again, the momentum is now overbought and the price is forming a clear resistance. A trader will be marking this area as bearish and switching to intraday charts to seek a bearish reversal pattern. The price declined and reached a support at 117 area. A trader will be marking this area as bullish and switching to intraday charts to seek a bullish reversal price pattern. The above setups will be attempted only in the direction of the trend established by the trader during a fundamental analysis.
The fundamentals were pointing to the downside in USDJPY. The first 3 setups would be considered and the 4th would be either ignored or entered as a counter trend position with a lower lot size. Fore more information CLICK HERE 2:The Moving average crossover strategy. Moving average indicators are standard within all trading platforms, the indicators can be set to the criteria that you prefer.
The 20 period line is our fast moving average, the 60 period is our slow moving average and the 100 period line is the trend indicator. How do I trade with it? And a SELL signal is generated when the fast moving average crosses below the slow MA. So you open a position when the MA lines cross in a one direction and you close the position when they cross back the opposite way. How do you know if the price is beginning to trend? Well, If the price bars stay consistently above or below the 100 period line then you know a strong price trend is in force and the trade should be left to run. The settings above can be altered to shorter periods but it will generate more false signals and may be more of a hindrance than a help.
The settings I suggested will generate signals that will allow you to follow a trend if one begins without short price fluctuations violating the signal. On the chart above I have circled in green four separate signals that this moving average crossover system has generated on the EURUSD daily chart over the last six months. On each of those occasions the system made 600, 200, 200 and 100 points respectively. I have also shown in red where this trading technique has generated false signals, these periods where price is ranging rather than trending are when a signal will most likely turn out to be false. The first false signal in the above example broke even, the next example lost 35 points. The above chart shows the first positive signal in detail, the fast MA crossed quickly down over the slow MA and the trend MA, generating the signal. Notice how the price moved quickly away from the trend MA and stayed below it signifying a strong trend.
The second false signal is shown above in detail, the signal was generated when the fast MA moved above the slow MA, only to reverse quickly and signal to close the position. We can immediately see how much more controlled and decisive trading becomes when a trading technique is used. There are no wild emotional rationalisation, every trade is based on a calculated reason. Heikin-Ashi chart looks like the candlestick chart but the method of calculation and plotting of the candles on the Heikin-Ashi chart is different from the candlestick chart.
They who on meare curiositie (where no urgent necessitie requireth) try whether their children may not as birds be nourished without sucking, offend contrary to this dutie of breast feeding and reflect that meanes which God hath ordained as best; and so oppose their shallow wits to his unsearchable wisdom. ~William Gouge, 1622

"windy reply" Just the reply you expect from an ideologue who lives in a fantasy. Does reality hurt your lil brain? I addressed more than one issue of perspective that you don?t appear aware of, and I entered into some historical detail to highlight its importance, which you demonstrate your obliviousness to. Meanwhile, your response is breezy and uninsightful, all meaning poorly informed.

Who is doing that? No actual people fit your bill. So, why are you comparing invented charicatures of atheists to atheists? If that isn't what you are doing then I am sure that your experience as an American would be to have people talk about Christians more. Also American Muslims are more moderate than other Muslims around the world so the Muslims that regular liberal people know are not fundamentalists.

Hi, my name is Dustin Greenwood and if you're interested in having an environmentally friendly home built, welcome to my blog. I am passionate about environmental issues so when I decided to have a home built, I wanted it to be as green as possible. I researched the various ways that homeowners can build an earth friendly home and you'll learn all about them in my blog. This information includes properly insulating the home, types of sustainable materials, recycling usable materials and installing solar panels. You'll also discover the benefits of energy efficient appliances and windows. You can also speak with your construction contractor for additional ideas about building an environmentally friendly home. I hope this blog gives you all the information you need about ecofriendly home building.
Do you cringe every time you open up your heating bill? If the answer is yes, you definitely need to make some changes. Your heating bills do not have to break the bank. Here are some steps you can take to reduce your heating bills.
An easy way to retain heat in your house is to leave the oven door open. After you get done cooking a meal, keep the door open for 15 to 20 minutes. The warm air coming out of the oven will give your heating system a break.
Most electrical boxes in houses are not insulated very well. If insulation is not installed correctly, a lot of warm air can escape right out of these electrical boxes. It is a good idea to check these electrical boxes for gaps at least once a month. If you find a gap, you should fill it with acrylic latex caulk as soon as possible.
If the windows in your home are old and not very energy efficient, your heating bills will likely be a lot higher. Consider replacing your older windows with more energy efficient ones. Newer windows are a big investment, but they will help you save more money in the long run. If newer windows are not in your budget right now, at least cover up your windows with plastic wrap to prevent cold drafts from coming in.
One of the simplest ways to save money on your heating bills is to just turn down your thermostat. If you just turn it down four or five degrees, you will see a difference in your heating bills. If you feel chilly inside your home, put a space heater in the living room. This way, you can still feel warm when the thermostat is lower.
If you want to keep your heating bills low, you must remember to replace the furnace filters every month. When these filters fill up with dust and dirt, the furnace can't run as efficiently.
Keeping your heating bills low is not impossible. If you follow these helpful tips, you will not dread opening up your heating bills every month. However, if your heating bills are still through the roof, you should have a heating contractor inspect your furnace as soon as possible.

In case you’ve been living under a rock this past week, legendary jockey Frankie Dettori has signed-up as our new racing ambassador.
And to celebrate we’re going all out to show our support for the Italian by offering you even greater value at this weekend’s huge meeting in the Middle East.
The Dubai World Cup is the world’s richest race and the centre piece of an incredible card this Saturday.
We won’t be beaten on price today between 09:00 – 12:00 (Prices compared with William Hill, Coral, Betfred, Bet365, Skybet and Paddy Power).
With bigger prices there’s even more reason to back our man, starting with Sloane Avenue in the first race at 12:20.
Frankie feels his charge has unfinished business in this contest after narrowly missing out in last year’s Godolphin Mile.
The Marco Botti-trained Lazzam is another lively chance, this time in the UAE Derby at 13:35 while six-furlong specialist Domineer (14:45) is also likely to offer great value.
Meanwhile, Euro Charline can go well in the Dubai Turf at 15:45 before we get round to the big one at 17:00.
Mshawish is Frankie’s Dubai World Cup ride and the Al Shaqab-owned six-year-old has more than just an outside chance of upsetting the favourite, California Chrome.

Malayalam leads among magazines with 1.610 million copies, Dainik Jagran and Dainik Bhaskar at No. 1 and 2 among top 10 publications
The Audit Bureau of Circulation’s (ABC) report released on May 8 says Hindi publications witnessed the highest growth with a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 8.76 per cent between 2006 and 2016. Telugu was the second fastest growing with a CAGR of 8.28 per cent and English stood at No. 5, clocking a 2.87 per cent CAGR.
The results were presented by Shashi Sinha, CEO, IPG Mediabrands and a member of ABC at an event in Mumbai. Others present at the event were I Venkat, Director, Eenadu and Chairman, ABC; Devendra Darda, MD, Lokmat Samachar; Sandip Tarkas, former President, Customer Strategy, Future Retail Ltd., Girish Agarwal, Dainik Bhaskar and H Masani, General Secretary, ABC.
The report suggested newspapers are thinking along the lines of greater local news coverage in order to cater to every segment of consumers as well as readers.
ABC certifies a total of 967 publications, of which 910 are daily/ weekly newspapers and 57 are magazines.
Even among the top 10 publications, Dainik Jagran and Dainik Bhaskar stood at No. 1 and No. 2 spots with average qualifying sales figures (July-December 2016) of 3.921 million and 3.813 million, respectively. The Times of India was the only English publication to be listed in the top 10 with average qualifying sales of 3.184 million, at No. 3.
Next in the list were Amar Ujala (Hindi), Hindustan (Hindi), Malayala Manorama (Malayalam), Eenadu (Telugu), Rajasthan Patrika (Hindi), Daily Thanthi (Tamil) and Mathrubhumi (Malayalam).
ABC-India releases two reports every year, certifying circulation figures of member publications. The trend of certified circulation figures by ABC show that the print medium (member publications of ABC) is thriving, growing and expanding in India in spite of stiff competition from all other mediums -- television, radio and digital.
Publishers voluntarily enrol themselves as members of ABC to get their circulation figures audited. Founded in 1948, ABC is also the founder member of International Federation of Audit Bureaux of Certification (IFABC) since 1963.
In the last 10 years, about 2.37 crore copies have been added with an increase of 251 publishing centres in India. The latest report also mentions that the average copies per day in 2006 were 3.91 crore, which has grown to 6.28 crore in 2016. The number of publishing centres has grown from 659 to 910 in the same period.
Speaking about languages, Malayalam led the flock among the magazines with 1.610 million copies, out of the total 4.528 million copies. Hindi followed with 899 million and Telugu stood third with 470 million average copies.
Considering the zone-wise growth, north zone has seen the maximum growth with 7.83 per cent CAGR, closely followed by south zone with 4.95 per cent CAGR. West and east zones clocked CAGRs of 2.81 per cent and 2.63 per cent, respectively. In India, regional language newspapers have largely contributed to the growth.
Giving a sneak peek into the international perspective on the growth of the Indian print industry, the report established how India is the only country with positive growth numbers in print. The WAN IFRA report numbers of 2016 established that when compared to Australia (growth of -6 per cent), France (-3 per cent), Germany (-3 per cent), Japan (-2 per cent), the UK (-12 per cent) and the USA (-2 per cent), India is the only one showing a growth of 12 per cent in 2015.

This is certainly one of the more premium sites about. Proud Winner of the AVN & XBIZ Awards 2013, they certainly know how to stand out from the crowd. Their focus is simple, providing top end features, the biggest names in porn, the hottest videos about, all quality, and all wrapped up in a nice bow, with an on-line store to boot. Everything about these guys says that you are dealing with top end of porn, and though it may lack the niche pockets that some may crave, for a bulk hot porn fest, you are definitely in safe hands.
This site simply provides the top end of porn about. There are the biggest names in the game, the hottest porn stars, and the fittest fresh faces you could dream of. There are over 1000 of the hottest babes around – many of them familiar faces (and familiar tits, ass, and pussies). And you can search by girls as well, so you are never far away from finding your favourite in all her best roles. They hold over 500 awarded feature movies, with over 3000 HD videos, 48000 bonus videos, and tons of exclusive content (and exclusive always adds that extra value).. This overall gives you plenty to choose from, and it all comes with a trusted stamp of approval. But it doesn’t end there, with cam options galore you can also access hot live action – and this includes FREE LIVE SEX SHOWS!, which always makes a great change from those scenes we love, by watching these naughty minxes do what you want, as you want. Hottest babes, tick. Full high definiton, professional shoots, tick. Lots of it? Tick, tick, tick. Oh yes, and it is all updated 17 times a day.
These guys really offer it all, with unlimited downloads, a full mobile version, plenty of formats, and even have a Wicked On The Go – meaning that you will never be without your favourite web resource. This is definitely the professional end and a big company that put their stamp on not only the quality of their porn, not only the options that there are, but also on how the site is run, how you can access it, and really the whole package is taken care of.
The great news just keeps coming. First, there is two day trial available for $1 – so you don’t need to take my word for it but can see for yourself with a very small investment. Should you join, the monthly option is $19.95, about average, but that is for sites that do not offer extras and that stamp of approval that these guys do. But if you really like it and want to sign up for a full year, this comes down to the equivalent of $4.99 a month – which is right down the bottom end of what a site can cost you, and for what these guys are offering, it really is a bargain.
Really, unless you are looking for a particular niche that you want filled (special interest porn if you will), then this site has to be one of your best options. It is decently priced (if not cheap), offers great exclusive content, full HD, 100% downloadable, free live shows, cams…what more could you want? And all of this with the biggest and hottest name in porn! Oh, you can also watch the biggest names in porn fuck live straight from you computer! In terms of quantity, they have hit that mark as well, with a staggering amount of updates, plenty already there, and a lot of it award winning features. If you really want a site this is one to be considered near the top of the list.
All Tessa Chansen ever wanted was a stable place to call home. She though she'd found that when she moved in with Jared -- until his home became her prison. When his control escalates, the only answer is to escape -- an escape that's hampered when she falls and fractures her ankle.
While building his graphic design company, Nate Brooks is focused on the future he's dreamed of: traveling around the country from the comfort of his renovated school bus. But when he picks up a wounded, mysterious hitchhiker, those well-laid plans take a backseat to protecting her.
Hobbled by her injury, Tessa fears she'll never find freedom. Or has she found it with the family who graciously opens their home to her? And with Nate's protection put his family -- and his heart -- at risk?
This is the eleventh book in the innovative Potter's House series -- a multi-authored series of standalone books loosely linked through the theme of "hope, redemption and second chances."
"I'm learning that when God sends me on a detour, I need to enjoy the view." (p 58). That's Nate Brooks -- gregarious, mission-minded and compassionate. Always ready to share the gospel and come to the aid of someone in need. In fact, he has a reputation for picking up 'strays' of the two-legged variety. He can't help it when those God nudges prompt him to offer help before he can think things all the way through.
Nate is young -- just out of college and starting up his own business. He's all about fiscal responsibility and making a dent in those student loans. He doesn't have the time or inclination to get mixed up in Tessa's complicated story...only there's that divine nudge...more of a shove, really that has him reaching out to help even though Tessa's loathe to accept it. She's aggravating and captivating and it doesn't take long for Nate to become completely entangled in her life.
Fleeing an emotionally abusive relationship, Tessa hardly recognizes the woman she's become. So far from the faith she grew up with and the music she lived for. Watching her slowly regain her confidence and sense of self makes for a captivating read. Alternately sweet and heart-wrenching. Even funny in places.
Place Called Home is a short novel that packs a wicked punch. A story with heart and hope and the miracles that come in the form of divine second chances.

seo professional | what is seo optimization | website optimization services | pay per click advertising
Search engine advertising (SEA) is an efficient and affordable online marketing strategy that helps your company website enjoy greater visibility by advertising on Google using varying methods. We differentiate between Google Ads, which are paid advertising, and the organic search results, whose ranking is determined only by the search algorithm. When you advertise on Google, text is displayed above, next to, or under the search results if it suits the search query, and is identified through the "ad" label. Aside from this, there is little difference between them and the snippets (text extracts from websites) in the middle. Ads on google are free initially; the clicks that the advert generates are billed. The price per click depends on your budget and how accurately your website is suited to the search query. As Google is by far the most used search engine in the US, search engine advertisement here is among the most profitable. AdWords is a program that Google uses to sell its adverts worldwide. With our tool you can invest in Google-AdWords campaigns in just a few clicks. The 1&1 experts can give you advice on finding the Google advertising plan that's right for your budget and takes into account the right keywords. With the right strategy for search engine adverts, you can then directly and efficiently target potential clients.
While organic search has the advantage of being free and can be influenced by your website content, it is limited to the number of people searching for your business or the products and services you offer. Paid search advertising allows you to reach a broader target audience which has more potential customers who may not be aware of your business, all while providing you full control over your messaging and costs.
Another one of the benefits of SEM is that people who see your PPC ads are those most likely to want to buy your product or service. PPC ads require you to choose a geographic location and specific search queries to target. As a result, you can be sure that anyone who clicks on your ad is not arbitrarily surfing the web, but rather, is looking for your product or service and in a position to do so.
Understanding the working mechanism of social algorithms is not a piece of cake. The algorithm for each social platform works differently. For instance, on Facebook, a core factor that affects the rankings of a post is its relevancy score, whereas on YouTube the total watch time of the video per session decides whether a video enters a ‘Recommended Video’ section or not.
Anyone who types in a search query has a specific intent. And they’re expecting the content that they find in the SERPs to satisfy that intent. If you can understand the search intent of your prospective customers, it will transform your marketing in several ways. You’ll be able to predict what keywords your potential customers are likely to use. It’s easy to start targeting keywords with no structure or strategy. But that’s a mistake.
I agree with the point that a small or medium-sized business will have limits for budget and resources in generating brand search, but I wouldn't say that stops them from potentially producing huge growth there if they do something interesting/innovative etc. I can think of quite a few small to medium sized brands that have more name recognition than larger companies in their space. The challenge is that many of those brands are led by people who are very good at generating marketing and publicity - it's harder for small brands to be able to afford to pay for a top level consultant or agency.
I have always believed in good quality content, well structured and written in a way that isn’t just about promotional talk. Thanks for sharing this information with us, it’s always helpful to have everything written in a concise manner so we can remind ourselves now and again of what it takes to increase organic traffic. As an SEO consultant myself I come across websites all the time that are messy and still using tactics that have long been out of date. Having a successful website is all about quality content and links. I like it that you stated what the problem was and then how you fixed it for the client. Great article.
An effective tactic to use to improve your SEO analysis is to measure the sources of your visitors and leads. By doing this, you will understand how impactful your tactics and strategy truly is. By using website tools such as Google Analytics and Adobe Omniture, you can learn about your traffic sources which can be helpful in learning if your SEO optimizations are effective. For example, are your users entering your website through your social media posts or are they finding your content through an organic search? Or maybe, you’ll find that your paid marketing tactics are more effective than you’d imagine. The bottom line is tracking your visitors and leads can provide many insights for both your paid and organic marketing strategies.
Check out the average CPC for some top industries. These are the costs of one click. Mind you, that’s a click that is not guaranteed to convert a customer. With paid campaigns, you have to keep optimizing and testing the ad creative to lower your CPC and increase your CTR. You can imagine that it takes a massive budget to even set a paid campaign in motion. And it requires just as much to keep maintaining it.
Apart from the above mentioned factors, analyzing your competitors’ social strategy, the industry your business falls into, and individual social platforms will also help you in deciding the right social strategy. For instance, last year Facebook reduced the exposure of organic content, so for exponential results on Facebook a brand must go for paid ads.
The Platforms and Content: Because of all this information, your content should be step-by-step instructions with visual guides and images on how to create a wide variety of decorations for children’s rooms. This means that your platform would need to be both visual and instructional. Based on all this I would recommend creating social profiles on Pinterest, Instagram, a Youtube channel, and a blog. You will then want to create a wide variety of kid’s room decoration ideas. These should be posted widely and often on your social platforms.
Ad groups allow for each campaign to be further subcategorized for relevance. In our hardware store example, one ad group could be for different types of rakes or varying models of leaf blowers. For the power tools campaign, one ad group might focus on power drills, while another could focus on circular saws. This level of organization might take slightly longer to set up initially, but the rewards – namely higher CTRs at lower cost – make this effort worthwhile in the long run.
Publishing quality content on a regular basis can help you attract targeted organic search traffic. But creating great content that gets ranked higher in the search engines isn’t easy. If your business doesn’t have the necessary resources, developing strong content assets can prove to be a challenge. Which affects your ability to have a working content strategy.
The term “organic traffic” is used for referring to the visitors that land on your website as a result of unpaid (“organic”) search results. Organic traffic is the opposite of paid traffic, which defines the visits generated by paid ads. Visitors who are considered organic find your website after using a search engine like Google or Bing, so they are not “referred” by any other website.
A few links down and I've noticed that Brian has a link from WordPress.org. Not bad! Turns out that his content has been referenced within one of WordPress's codex posts. If I were to reach out and offer some additional insight, citing one of my articles, there's a chance I could bag a similar link, especially considering they have a 'Useful Resources' section.
There are also a few more similarities. All of these marketing methods are measurable to an extent never seen in any other media. Every click can be measured – where and when it came – and followed through to the conversion, the sale and the lifetime customer value. This feedback loop creates optimization opportunities that can create huge incremental improvements in your SEM campaigns.
Paid inclusion is a search engine marketing method in itself, but also a tool of search engine optimization, since experts and firms can test out different approaches to improving ranking and see the results often within a couple of days, instead of waiting weeks or months. Knowledge gained this way can be used to optimize other web pages, without paying the search engine company.
Hi Rand! Thanks for a really informative and thought provoking Whiteboard Friday. I agree with Namrata about the challenges to local and small businesses that all the rapid changes with little to know warning from Google as far as they're concerned. In many cases, they're just rapping their heads and marketing strategies around having someone create and optimize their website and content for how Google SERPs used to work, and even with basic GMB listings, they have been unaware or unsure of how to use them. Some have been taken advantage of because of lack of understanding and awareness of how Google listings and GMB work and that it's free.
Organic products have shifted from being a lifestyle choice for a small share of consumers to being consumed at least occasionally by a majority of Americans. National surveys conducted by the Hartman Group and Food Marketing Institute during the early 2000s found that two-thirds of surveyed shoppers bought organically grown foods. For a literature review of organic consumer studies, see the ERS report:
Even if you don’t have a website, you can still make sure customers can find you online by creating listings on sites like DexKnows and Yelp. Just be aware that your customer base will be relying more and more on the internet to learn about your company, and a website will better provide the information they seek, as well as helping you build their confidence in your business.
Since there is an obvious barrier of entry for anyone trying to beat you once you’re established, you won’t have to worry about having competitors “buying” their way to the top. Their only option is pay per click ads, but then again, it isn’t the same as getting a higher position on the SERPs. Again, this is assuming that you took the right steps and were patient enough to solidify your place in the top search results.
Encourage incoming links. Google prioritises sites that have a lot of incoming links, especially from other trustworthy sites. Encourage clients, friends, family members, partners, suppliers, industry mavens and friendly fellow bloggers to link to your site. The more incoming links you have the higher your site will rank. But beware SEO snake oil salesmen who try to trick Google with spammy links from low-reputation sites. Some links can actually damage your SEO.
Hubspot found that their articles up to 2500 words drive the most traffic. Similarly, posts with more than 2500 words generated more social shares and links. Naturally, it takes some investment to create that quality of content. The key is to come up with evergreen ideas. This way, your investment will more than pay for itself because your content will be serving your business goals years down the line. Put people first. The thing about search engines and how they rank content? It’s unpredictable. But one thing will remain constant. The job of a search engine is to connect users with the most relevant and useful information. If your content serves that purpose, you don’t have to fear algorithm changes.
Think about this. Where do you first turn to when you have a problem or when you’re curious about a topic? Google, right? It’s a no-brainer. Search engines are the ideal matchmakers between you and potential customers. In fact, 93% of all online interactions begin with a search engine. To leave this prospects in the dust is to leave revenue on the table. But here’s where search engines and organic traffic give you a real marketing edge.
Another part of SEM is social media marketing (SMM). SMM is a type of marketing that involves exploiting social media to influence consumers that one company’s products and/or services are valuable.[22] Some of the latest theoretical advances include search engine marketing management (SEMM). SEMM relates to activities including SEO but focuses on return on investment (ROI) management instead of relevant traffic building (as is the case of mainstream SEO). SEMM also integrates organic SEO, trying to achieve top ranking without using paid means to achieve it, and pay per click SEO. For example, some of the attention is placed on the web page layout design and how content and information is displayed to the website visitor. SEO & SEM are two pillars of one marketing job and they both run side by side to produce much better results than focusing on only one pillar.
To give you an idea of just how much money is being spent on paid search, take a look at Google. Google's AdWords program is the most used pay-per-click (PPC) advertising program available today. While the tech giant owns YouTube and Android, among hundreds of other profitable brands, AdWords accounts for roughly 70% of their revenue -- which speaks wonders for its effectiveness.
In 2007, Google announced a campaign against paid links that transfer PageRank.[29] On June 15, 2009, Google disclosed that they had taken measures to mitigate the effects of PageRank sculpting by use of the nofollow attribute on links. Matt Cutts, a well-known software engineer at Google, announced that Google Bot would no longer treat nofollowed links in the same way, to prevent SEO service providers from using nofollow for PageRank sculpting.[30] As a result of this change the usage of nofollow led to evaporation of PageRank. In order to avoid the above, SEO engineers developed alternative techniques that replace nofollowed tags with obfuscated Javascript and thus permit PageRank sculpting. Additionally several solutions have been suggested that include the usage of iframes, Flash and Javascript.[31]
I think for agencies as far as how we appear in organic search ourselves, we are definitely going to need to leverage all 3 of the solutions you talk about and agencies who haven't branded their products/services are going to have to do that and are going to have to also employ branding strategies. In addition, we have to optimize for other search ares like you say in your point #2 and we must look at optimizing existing content for voice search and answers/featured snippets like you say in point #3.
Keyword difficulty is a number that lets you know how difficult it will be to rank for a certain keyword. The higher the number, the more difficult it will be to rank on that keyword. There are a few sites online that will tell you keyword difficulty of a word or phrase. Record these numbers in your Excel document or Google Sheet that you made earlier.
Paid Search (PPC): Paid search results are advertisements. A business pays to have their ads displayed when users do a search containing specific keywords. The ads are typically displayed above and to the right of organic search results. The exact placement of the ads is determined by both a bidding process and quality score. The advantages and drawbacks of paid search are often the opposite of organic listings.
The piece on generating demand for branded queries rather than just product-based ones is particularly interesting here. It sounds as though it'll be more important than ever to have a strong brand in order to succeed (rather than just having a well-optimized site -- and ideally, having the strategic, technical, and creative sides all working together cohesively). Perhaps it's possible that brand exposure through things like answer boxes can still deliver some value too, even if it's difficult to measure, and CTRs are diminished?
Let’s first take a quick look at what organic marketing is and what it is not. Organic marketing is an array of marketing disciplines that create a cohesive and comprehensive approach to inbound marketing. It is using the online search and traffic habits of potential clients to reach them by creating high-quality and high-visibility content for them to consume.
Organic social media is anything that happens on social media without paid promotion. When you post as your page but don’t put any money behind this post to “boost” it, you are creating an organic post. If you comment on a business’s post in your news feed, and the “Sponsored” tag does not appear on the post, that action qualifies as organic. In other words, organic actions occur on non-ads.
Optimise for your personas, not search engines. First and foremost, write your buyer personas so you know to whom you’re addressing your content. By creating quality educational content that resonates with you>r ideal buyers, you’ll naturally improve your SEO. This means tapping into the main issues of your personas and the keywords they use in search queries. Optimising for search engines alone is useless; all you’ll have is keyword-riddled nonsense.
“Organic” is something of a buzz word. In the food sector, it carries connotations of healthy living, natural growth and honest, responsibly sourced products. Those connotations are just as relevant when the term relates to marketing campaigns. Companies encourage and maintain healthy growth through the use of carefully targeted organic content marketing. Doing so builds trust in the customer base while extending the brand’s reach. You may already be using organic marketing as part of your business strategy (perhaps without even realizing it). But, if you aren’t, it’s time to consider how to plant the seeds of a new campaign that helps your business to grow and flourish.
Google is a king. What best Google has done, kept all the bloggers life in a big web. Try to become as independent/different as you can, which Google might not have heard. It can be either name, brand, activity, etc...People focus on that things which they have never heard. It's unique way to come up in SERP's. We are used to EverydayHealth, EverydayLife, gets bored. Make sure people have reasons to return to YOUR site as often as possible.
Utilizing keywords in your URLs will also help with your rankings. Unfortunately, there isn’t much you can do to change the home page URL of your website without your domain authority being reset. However, each additional page you add is a place to insert a keyword, as long as it is relevant to the actual page content. We’ll go over blogging shortly, but URLs of blog posts are a great place to use your keywords.
Organic search should not be viewed as just one of many different marketing strategies. Instead, it should be the cornerstone of your efforts. Your materials should all be optimized to maximize their appearance on the SERPs. You should also be using the insights that can be gleaned from organic search to inform the rest of your marketing endeavors.
Look at your short- and long-term goals to choose whether to focus on organic or paid search (or both). It takes time to improve your organic search rankings, but you can launch a paid search campaign tomorrow. However, there are other considerations: the amount of traffic you need, your budget, and your marketing objectives. Once you’ve reviewed the pros and cons, you can select the search strategy that’s right for you.
Content is one of the 3 main Google ranking factors. As a matter of fact, having a blog can help you get your content indexed faster. An active blog – relying on qualitative and insightful content, and backed by authoritative links – will help you improve your rankings and thus your organic traffic. Also, long-form copies (above 1200 words) tend to rank higher and be crawled more often.
In short, press request alerts are requests for sources of information from journalists. Let's say you're a journalist putting together an article on wearable technology for The Guardian. Perhaps you need a quote from an industry expert or some products that you can feature within your article? Well, all you need to do is send out a request to a press service and you can wait for someone to get back to you.
So if you're in the local space and you're saying, "Gosh, Google has really taken away the ability for my website to get the clicks that it used to get from Google local searches," going into Google My Business and optimizing to provide information such that people who perform that query will be satisfied by Google's result, yes, they won't get to your website, but they will still come to your business, because you've optimized the content such that Google is showing, through Google My Business, such that those searchers want to engage with you. I think this sometimes gets lost in the SEO battle. We're trying so hard to earn the click to our site that we're forgetting that a lot of search experience ends right at the SERP itself, and we can optimize there too.
SEO may generate an adequate return on investment. However, search engines are not paid for organic search traffic, their algorithms change, and there are no guarantees of continued referrals. Due to this lack of guarantees and certainty, a business that relies heavily on search engine traffic can suffer major losses if the search engines stop sending visitors.[60] Search engines can change their algorithms, impacting a website's placement, possibly resulting in a serious loss of traffic. According to Google's CEO, Eric Schmidt, in 2010, Google made over 500 algorithm changes – almost 1.5 per day.[61] It is considered wise business practice for website operators to liberate themselves from dependence on search engine traffic.[62] In addition to accessibility in terms of web crawlers (addressed above), user web accessibility has become increasingly important for SEO.
Google doesn't always include a whole paragraph of text in the Featured Snippet. If you add "Step 1," "Step 2," "Step 3," etc. to the start of each HTML heading within your content (for example, within your H2 tags), Google will sometimes just list out your headings within the Featured Snippet. I've started to see this happen more and more in keywords beginning with "how to".
For our client: We monitored everything on a daily basis. If something came up, which needed to be fixed, we were quick to implement it with the development team at the business. We also rolled out numerous campaigns multiple times as they worked effectively the first time around in generating significant traffic so it was second nature to do the same thing twice.
Early versions of search algorithms relied on webmaster-provided information such as the keyword meta tag or index files in engines like ALIWEB. Meta tags provide a guide to each page's content. Using metadata to index pages was found to be less than reliable, however, because the webmaster's choice of keywords in the meta tag could potentially be an inaccurate representation of the site's actual content. Inaccurate, incomplete, and inconsistent data in meta tags could and did cause pages to rank for irrelevant searches.[10][dubious – discuss] Web content providers also manipulated some attributes within the HTML source of a page in an attempt to rank well in search engines.[11] By 1997, search engine designers recognized that webmasters were making efforts to rank well in their search engine, and that some webmasters were even manipulating their rankings in search results by stuffing pages with excessive or irrelevant keywords. Early search engines, such as Altavista and Infoseek, adjusted their algorithms to prevent webmasters from manipulating rankings.[12]
Student teams that demonstrate strong Google Ads knowledge, develop a thorough online marketing strategy, execute optimized Google Ads campaigns and provide a post-campaign analysis with future recommendations for their nonprofit partner will receive a personalized certificate from Google recognizing their academic achievement and social impact. Top performing teams also have the opportunity to submit their story to be featured in Google’s Social Impact Spotlight Series, as well as Hangout on Air with Googlers near and far.
In order to quickly identify the correct content and websites that will meet their needs almost all users will use a search engine such as Google. Typing a query into a search engine will generate a set of results that are a combination of paid and organic search listings. The user can then choose the most relevant link from these results or search again if the results are not helpful.
By relying so much on factors such as keyword density which were exclusively within a webmaster's control, early search engines suffered from abuse and ranking manipulation. To provide better results to their users, search engines had to adapt to ensure their results pages showed the most relevant search results, rather than unrelated pages stuffed with numerous keywords by unscrupulous webmasters. This meant moving away from heavy reliance on term density to a more holistic process for scoring semantic signals.[13] Since the success and popularity of a search engine is determined by its ability to produce the most relevant results to any given search, poor quality or irrelevant search results could lead users to find other search sources. Search engines responded by developing more complex ranking algorithms, taking into account additional factors that were more difficult for webmasters to manipulate. In 2005, an annual conference, AIRWeb, Adversarial Information Retrieval on the Web was created to bring together practitioners and researchers concerned with search engine optimization and related topics.[14]
If both page are closely related (lots of topical overlap), I would merge the unique content from the lower ranking article into the top ranking one, then 301 redirect the lower performing article into the top ranking one. This will make the canonical version more relevant, and give it an immediate authority boost. I would also fetch it right away, do some link building, and possibly a little paid promotion to seed some engagement. Update the time stamp.
Some search engines have also reached out to the SEO industry, and are frequent sponsors and guests at SEO conferences, webchats, and seminars. Major search engines provide information and guidelines to help with website optimization.[18][19] Google has a Sitemaps program to help webmasters learn if Google is having any problems indexing their website and also provides data on Google traffic to the website.[20] Bing Webmaster Tools provides a way for webmasters to submit a sitemap and web feeds, allows users to determine the "crawl rate", and track the web pages index status.
Hi Chris, "Good content" means a couple of things - good for readers and good for Google. Good content for readers means that the content answers questions, provides value, offers solutions, and is engaging. You want to keep the reader on the page and on your website for as long as possible. To make good content for Google, you have to provide the search engine with a set of signals - e.g., keywords, backlinks, low bounce rates, etc... The idea is that if you make good content for readers (engaging, valuable, actionable, and informative), your content will get more engagement. When your content gets more engagement Google will see it as good content too and put it higher in the SERPs. Making "good content" is about striking that balance. Let us know if that answered your question!
70% of marketers use Facebook to gain new customers, while 47% of marketers say that Facebook is their number one influencer of purchases, according to a recent report published on Business2Community. Below I’ll explain how to make the most of your Facebook marketing – read on to discover exciting, new ideas for increasing your page’s engagement and discover my top tips for propelling your paid and organic reach.
Social media changes so quickly that it can be difficult to keep up with terminology and best practices. One of the biggest points of confusion that I see with business owners and marketers is the distinction and strategic balance between organic and paid social media. Understanding this is essential to creating a successful social media marketing strategy. Organic and paid social media have distinct advantages but work best when implemented together. Every popular social media outlet has paid and organic elements, but since Facebook is the largest social network (both in terms of users and advertisers) I’m going to focus on that platform in this article.
This topic seems actually quite controversial. Google answered the question by what could be taken as a denial. But their answer was kind of open to interpretations. And on the other hand, there are studies (one of them from Moz) that showed linking out has an impact. So, how can you be so assertive? Is it something that comes out from your own experiments?
Online Marketing Challenge (OMC) is a unique opportunity for students to get real-world experience creating and executing online marketing campaigns for real nonprofits using a $10,000 USD monthly budget of in-kind Google Ads advertising credit through the Google Ad Grants program. This global academic program brings two worlds together, partnering students and nonprofits, to support digital skill development and drive positive change around the world.
So, closely monitor and analyze all yours, and your competitor’s social marketing activities. Find the kind of posts your followers and target audience find interesting by analyzing social channels, campaigns and posts. Figure out what works best for your brand in a given scenario. Based on the inputs you gain from analyzing your social channels, craft the social media marketing strategies for your company.
Google claims their users click (organic) search results more often than ads, essentially rebutting the research cited above. A 2012 Google study found that 81% of ad impressions and 66% of ad clicks happen when there is no associated organic search result on the first page.[2] Research has shown that searchers may have a bias against ads, unless the ads are relevant to the searcher's need or intent [3]
STAMFORD, Conn., May 21, 2012 - Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI) today announced notice of its election to redeem $400 million of its bonds which are scheduled to mature in October 2012.

We are a solidly profitable company and expect to generate $700-$800 million in free cash flow this year. Our free cash flow is sufficient to pay our dividend, reduce our debt and support ongoing investment in our business. This action also reinforces our support for maintaining our investment grade ratings.”
The company is reaffirming its guidance for the year for revenue, adjusted earnings per share and free cash flow as provided in its first quarter earnings press release.

Nuclear Energy for Hydrogen Generation through Intermediate Heat Exchangers: A Renewable Source of Energy
It's been more than a month since president Trump said drugmakers would announce “voluntary massive drops in prices” in two weeks, but Politico’s Sarah Karlin-Smith reports that many drug companies have been going the other way, especially with brand-name drugs: “A Wells Fargo report found 104 price increases in June and the first two days of July, with an average jump of 31.5 percent and a median increase of 9.4 percent. That followed 48 increases in May. The list price hikes don’t factor in discounts that companies may provide to some insurance companies and patients.”
Drug manufacturers typically post price hikes at this time of year. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Congress last week that he hoped drug companies will “practice restraint” when raising prices. But the industry has little incentive to do so — and plenty of reason not to.
“Forgoing drug price hikes means forfeiting one of the few easy ways to boost their top and bottom lines,” writes The Wall Street Journal’s Charley Grant. “In certain cases, skipping a price hike could mean a decline in revenues if the drugmaker can’t offer a big enough rebate to middlemen in the supply chain.” And big drug companies have already been struggling to post the kind of growth shareholders want to see. Grant notes that their stocks have lagged the market for nearly two years.
“The industry isn’t taking the administration seriously on drug pricing because there doesn’t appear to be a credible threat if they don’t comply with these requests,” Stacie Dusetzina, a drug pricing expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, told Politico’s Karlin-Smith. “While there are some items in the [Trump administration’s] recently released Drug Pricing Blueprint that explore ways to incentivize companies to not increase prices or to increase accountability for price hikes, these are a long way from being implemented.”
The bottom line: “The bully pulpit and rhetoric alone are proving insufficient to affect bad behavior on prices. Congress and the administration need to take action,” John Rother, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, told Politico.

SPRINGFIELD - A proposed $45 million shopping center at the former Westinghouse Electric Corp. property in East Springfield is delayed, triggered, in part, by the poor economy. Packard Development of Newton is proposing the shopping center on the 41-acre parcel on Page Boulevard. When announced in March of 2008, the company anticipated approximately 20 stores including discount department stores, neighborhood convenience stores and two restaurants. The retail center was expected to cover 450,000 square feet, and create between 700 and 800 permanent retail jobs.

After saving money for a down payment on construction, the last thing you want to deal with is a project that lags or doesn't come out right. I have experienced a few issues like this in the past, which is why I focus carefully on choosing the right contracting team. This blog is all about working hard to find the right team of building professionals so that you can enjoy a beautiful home of your own. Check out these tips for vetting different experts, knowing the signs of trouble, and communicating effectively with your contractors. After all, you never know when you will need these tips.
The holidays are coming! Now is the time to get your garbage disposal ready to work hard. These tips will help you get your unit ready for heavy use at big holiday meals.
Gunk that builds up inside your garbage disposal can cause clogs over time. Luckily, there are many natural products that you probably keep around your house that you can use to clean out the inside of your garbage disposal.
Ice. Crushing ice in your garbage disposal helps grind away food particles stuck to the inside of the unit.
Salt. Like ice, coarse salt also produces a scrubbing action against the walls of the garbage disposal, which helps to clean the walls and the blades of the unit.
Vinegar. Vinegar is slightly acidic and will eat away at old organic material stuck in the blades and walls of the disposal. Flushing your garbage disposal with vinegar also helps neutralize any unpleasant odors coming from your unit. You can flush vinegar down your garbage disposal on its own, or put it in the garbage disposal with other ingredients like salt or lemon juice.
Lemon juice. Much like vinegar, lemon juice helps flush away old food particles inside the unit while also covering up unpleasant smells. Some people may prefer to use lemon juice because of the pleasant scent, while others may prefer vinegar because it's often less expensive.
Baking soda. Sprinkle baking soda into the garbage disposal and pour boiling hot water down after it. Baking soda can unstick difficult to remove foods like melted cheese and grease.
Pouring any one of these items down the drain and then turning on the garbage disposal can help clean out your unit for the holidays. Doing this on a regular basis will help keep drain clear and keep the inside of the unit clean and fresh.
You probably have rules about what things can and can't go down your garbage disposal. Make a small sign clarifying which items aren't supposed to go down the garbage. Post that sign near the switch that turns the disposal on and off. This will help ensure that any holiday visitors who want to help clean up dinner will know the proper procedure for using the disposal.
If your garbage disposal is draining slowly now, it's likely to get worse. Have a professional plumber come snake your drain now before the situation becomes an emergency. This will help ensure that your kitchen will be ready for your holiday guests.
Hello everyone, Due to IRL issues, I have been inactive, But I'm back now. So let's begin, TodayOnce we hit 5-10 online again, we will have massive bossing trips, and...
We don't have a way for you to look up oem parts yet but you can use the parts search HERE to get part numbers then use the OSD search to see if we have what you need. If the part doesn't show contact us and we'll add any parts not listed to our site (if not discontinued).
When searching our site, you may notice out of stock parts. Parts not in big demand aren't kept on hand but we can usually get any out of stock item in quick. On our OSD parts (will have OSD in the title) and aftermarket parts we can usually have those here in 2-3 days once ordered. On most OEM parts those take about a week to get in. If you want one disregard any "0" quantities and order for quick service!

Psychologist Raphael Rose, associate director of UCLA’s Anxiety and Depression Research Center and an associate clinical professor in the department of psychology and the department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences, has been awarded a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for research to support the health of astronauts on deep space missions.
Rose’s research is one of 24 projects selected from 178 proposals nationwide to receive a total of about $12.9 million during a one- to three-year period from NASA's Human Research Program and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute. All of the projects will contribute to knowledge needed for NASA’s journey to Mars by investigating the impact of the space environment on various aspects of astronaut health, from visual impairment to sensormotor adaptation.
Rose’s study, “Asynchronous Behavioral Health Treatment Techniques,” will explore methods of delivering evidence-based behavioral health care that could be used on a long-duration space mission such as one to Mars, where there will be 20-minute communication delays— asynchronous communication — between Earth and the crew. The study will take place at UCLA and will involve a randomized, controlled trial comparing in-person-delivered behavioral health care to a self-guided approach such as a computer-based software program for an area of relevance, such as anxiety, to long-duration space travel.
Rose has been conducting research with NASA for the past seven years on stress management and resilience training. He is currently principal investigator on a project that is evaluating a self-guided multimedia stress management and resilience-training program that he developed with flight controllers at NASA-Johnson Space Center.

There have been one page visits from such far away places as Paraguay and Madagascar and even Iraq. Despite Google's entry into China we are seeing relatively few visitors form there but I guess that will take time to develop.
Naturally we were also visited by 28 different robots during March - several of the larger ones come every day and it is interesting to note that Yahoo's bot made twice as many hits as Google bot. Is it just inefficient or is the number two just trying harder?
Like any global business our site is working round the clock with a peak at 15.00 UK server time when both Europe and the Eastern seaboard of the US are awake. This peak is four times the trough at 07.00 hours when both the West Coast and Western Europe are still asleep.

Poking around in the Web Design section of Google Analytics this morning brought out a couple of interesting observations:
1. Over 21% of our visitors now use FireFox - this has been growing steadily since we started getting any kind of tracking and I think was around 7% in the early days so that has trebled. As a member of that fraternity myself I can understand why it has caught on so strongly.
2. Only about 11% of our visitors use dial up connections. There are another 10% that the system can't identify but everyone else is on broadband of some kind. As some one who used to work in the telecomms industry and was in at the start of the R&D for ADSL this is extraordinary. Obviously the MP3 focus of the site leads to a strong self selection bias but it is helpful to know how strong this is. It also means from a practical point of view that we don't need to worry too much about page loading times or the size of downloads.
The rate of decline is the same on Google and Yahoo and in the major Keywords there are no obvious victims. Similarly the most frequently visited pages are showing no distinctive performance.
Our updating efforts on the streaming sample pages have brought no obvious benefits. The bounce rates on them have gone up nearly as often as they have gone down.
Just looking at the competitive sites on a 'Debussy MP3' search flags up the changes which have been going on. It looks as if there are legitimate piano recordings on sale for as little as $0.17 and there are amateur piano recordings offered free of charge by an Italian pianist. Where as in the past these offers were not evident we were often the first site you got to with a straight forward download offer. Our strategy from the outset was to take our price from the market leaders - iTunes and it is beginning to look as if we need to seriously reconsi…
In order to find the right tools to research high paying AdSense keywords, it is important to know what information you want to know about keywords. It would be just great if there were a tool that told everyone exactly what Google pays for each keyword, but that doesn't exist and anyone who creates such a tool is certain to be barred from Google forever because it is a clear violation of the terms and conditions of having an AdSense account to reveal any income information to anyone else.
You can use Adwords keyword tool to select keywords and you'll get some information. But there are many, many great tools out there that will help you select the right keywords for your AdSense campaign focus. Look for only those tools that provide information about the number of searches performed, the number of competing websites and a &quo…
Both are showing very few differences between data centers for key words that have been good indicators of Big Daddy progress up to now so it looks as if that is done. With Reladvance we can also see the variations in PR, Backlinks and Pages indexed which are extant across the data centers but evidently they are incidental to the Search Results rather than causal which is a useful lesson for the future interpretations of what is going on with Google updates.
Our problem is that we have been seeing a steady decline in visitor numbers from all sources over the last several weeks. Big Daddy has seen significant swings and roundabouts for various of our key words and phrases.
While updating the sample pages we have noticed potential sources of confusion between the composer and sample pages and part of that update has been to make the purpose of the sample pages clearer and make their optimisation. We are also working on the Ringtone pages to make t…
Just couldn't resist a quick peek with Analytics but it is either too early or it has had absolutely no impact.
The famous Matt Cutts Google posted yesterday about the current state of Big Daddy and confirmed that it is almost complete with only one or two data centers remaining to be updated.
It looks to us as if we are already benefiting from the first fruits of this change but the emphasis on infrastructure changes suggests that there may be subsequent changes as some of the new functionality is switched on and brought into use.
This article caught my eye as I was ignorant of this new development - knowing what this human editor excludes from this blog I'm a bit doubtful but read on and see what you think:
First of all, there may be some of you that have never even heard of Autoblogger Pro. So let's examine this new script. Autoblogger Pro is really a very simple concept. It integrates itself into a Wordpress blog and then uses RSS feeds from news sources and blogs to populate the blog with relevant content. For example, if you want to build a blog that focuses on 'Mortgages' then you would simply locate several blog or news feeds that focus on mortgages and then load them into the admin area of the script. Every time the script is executed it will then pull in the RSS feed from all of the sites you've entered, and post them to the blog. In essence, you end up with a blog that contains highly targeted content, blended and unique because it comes from a variety of sources. All maintained by …
A few key words have fallen back significantly and we can see the impact of that but others have been moving forward or holding their ground.
Without daily access to McDar we can't see if it is Google flux which is at play or some early reaction to the changes we have been making to our pages.
The sample page conversion program is making good headway now and we can see some light at the end of the tunnel. On reflection I think we'll use a slightly different template for the Ringtone products because we have never used the pop-up pages to display them and they are complete recordings rather than samples - just Lo Fi rather than Hi Fi.
We will be going through one composer at a time because the composer page has to be modified as well to cope with the larger pop-up file.
One of the last minute snags was Firefox suddenly deciding not to accept pop ups from us even though it was showing the acceptance rule for our site - it has recovered now thank goodness.
It is strange how dependent one can become on a regular source of information and it is hard to be patient but then again it is free, so I guess that you get what you pay for and we should just be grateful for their kind efforts.
McDar has been down for a few days now and so we have been unable to track the most recent progress of Big Daddy and we are still not sure what the overall impact will be for us even though it has rolled out to most data centers now. Rankpulse is showing exceptionally low levels of activity or flux, as it is often known, for all but one of the last six days.
Our overall visitor numbers are drifting very slowly downwards but we can't see any underlying trend. The spread of key words which our visitors use is so broad it is very hard to pick out what is going on in these circumstances even with he power of Google Analytics.
There are some straws in the wind which suggest that it might turn out OK. Certainly we are getting good coverage but there are a disturbi…
Yesterday's little panic about the site: search results for www.download2mp3.com is over we are restored albeit not quite to our former glory.
The number of links to is back down to 15 after sometime at 38 - not sure what this really signifies since it seems to be a pretty arbitrary although all the guidance says that links are important nobody really comments on the contents of these site search results.
The other elements such as pages from site and sites containing are relatively straight forward and you can see parallels with what the other major search engines pick up.
The more entertaining results are from the similar to or related to: search results . For a while we got a very odd collection of sites but it is settling down to a number of independent music sites. This is quite encouraging because this feature doesn't always work for other sites I keep track of.
Of course when I went back to check a couple of details it had gone again - just a touch of the flux - no doubt.
We were a bit previous on Friday - those last few surplus pixels have proved too elusive and the template still isn't fit for use.... Otherwise it looks great so more tedious experimenting today.
Big Daddy rolled out a little further this weekend and there are only a few data centers that have not been updated now - Google still on schedule.
- just a little bit of a shock to the system when this happens as it did this am. Some links from and pages that contain search results are available albeit on a relatively modest scale compared to what we are used to. This hasn't happened to other sites I look out for so we are hoping this is a passing glitch.
Following up on the template solution for the 'main' pages we have been working on a template for the samples pages. This has been tricky because we have been going from a flexible page width format to a fixed narrow centered one. Lots of fussy table design to get the graphics right. Just the update drudgery now.
The purpose of this is to strengthen the branding on the site and enable site wide update/messages more easily. The caching of the template material by visitors' browsers should mean that there is no significant addition to the download time for these pages.
On the Big Daddy front there has been no real movement on the data centers for a few days but we are seeing the potential impact of Big Daddy on our pages reduce as the results pre and post get closer together - let's hope Google haven't been doing all this for nothing!
Some Internet Marketing bloggers will post topics that vary greatly. Other Internet Marketing bloggers feel most comfortable when they are posting on a particular topic. The question has often been: which way is best? Studies demonstrate that defining your niche creates better blogging. So, using this discovery, it is assumed that it is best to choose one route to take, and stick with it. This can mean that you choose one large topic and use it to produce your total blog topic list. You will likely get repeated visitors if you are posting on the same subject matter in any case. If you are still not sold however, check out these other explanations for why defining your niche can lead to more successful Internet Marketing blogging.
While it can be monotonous to post on the same topic each day, there is one thing to be said about it. You will certainly know your topic. The more you post on a topic, the more thinking and res…
There has been absolutely no response to our startling announcement of the great advance of the '+' in our keyword phrases as reported on Analytics.
Not only was there no reaction here - not too surprising but nothing on the SEO forum where you ususally get a rasberry at least.
We've also noticed the impact of Big Daddy diminishing in terms of the differences between results from the different data centers but it ain't over yet.
Of course it will take a little longer to establish what effect it has on our visitors, if any, and longer still to see what reaction, if any, we get from Google. The new template removes a whole column of internal links from some pages and adds a side bar to others. We have also take the opportunity to remove the new page generator off links to all pages except the reference pages, like our commercial terms, to try and make it easier to navigate around the site.
We have started with Mozart as Composer of the week and The Entertainer as ring tone of the week with prominent links so we'll see what that does. We will use the side bar and the footer for trying out site wide changes and developments because it is so much easier to make consistent changes now. Analytics gives us a good appreciation of the use being made on the links on our pages which facilitates this sort of experimentation.
If a common word is essential to getting the results you want, you can include it by putting a "+" sign in front of it. (Be sure to include a space before the "+" sign.)
And they have been saying pretty much that for years so why is it that our visitors in the last week have augmented the spaces between their keywords with a "+"? This is not just a mild perturbation but a universal picture over the first 100 phrases. Phrases without "+" are sinking without trace.
Don't get me wrong the "+" has always been there but until now it lurked around the bottom of the list of keywords, an indication of the presence of slightly more sophisticated searchers who had been experiencing some mild frustration with their "+" free searches.
When something like this happens you tend to doubt your measuring instrument but we are now looking at a massive week on week change. So you check to see if anyone else has noticed but searches…
Now that our new Dreamweaver Template based pages are almost ready to launch we can start to look at how best to exploit the facility for change and experiment that they offer. One of the options is the use of scripts to provide more interaction and possibly automated update. So here are some ideas:
At the moment it looks like Big Daddy is stalled - Rankpulse has gone back to sleep again - the impact so far on us appears to be broadly neutral based on some ups and some downs across our broad range of keywords.
The phasing is quite unusual - normally Google will test an update or an update phase on one or two data centers and then roll it out quite quickly to the rest with a bit of subsequent flux while things settle down. With this one it seems to have stalled after rolling out to nearly half the data centers but there is some evidence of minor flux on some of our keywords using good old McDar. Perhaps there are issues at the remaining centers which need to be fixed before they can take it on - Google Knows!
The template adoption job is progressing slowly but surely, though we are still plagued by an irritating browser clash. The pages work fine on IE but one area is out by a couple of pixels on FireFox. On the other hand the p…

Newsweek, which prides itself on its award winning reporting, took the first week of September to push back against the broad based public perception that President Obama sold himself as someone he was not, and has pushed forward an agenda against the will of the American people.
The noticeable public response to this has been catalyzed in the Tea Party, all of which Newsweek manages to get wrong, and wrong in the biggest way possible. Take Jonathon Alter's lead article on "The Illustrated Man"
"President Obama is our era’s Illustrated Man. His enemies—and even some of his ostensible allies—have been busy for three years painting Obama as some kind of alien threat. His name, race, exotic upbringing, and determination to reach out to moderate Muslims have given those who would delegitimize him a fresh palette of dark colors. The caricatures are almost comical, as the president himself recognizes."
Yes, and that has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the anger and outrage this president has managed to engender against himself. Ray Bradbury's character had been the victim of a time traveling witch. Barack Obama is the victim of his own arrogant, grasping, power hungry, statist thuggish behavior. The man presented himself as an empty canvas, defining himself in only the vaguest of terms. What eighteen months of his presidency have revealed is that the man called Obama is the most liberal president this nation has ever had. He is a unparalleled disaster. This guy is the uniter? The post racial president? The bridge builder? This clown's agenda is all about taking advantage of whatever ails us, pretend it is a national disaster, whip up as much fear as possible and then use that as the impetus to push forward vast, sweeping changes that will change our nation at its core. And Alter - we didn't vote for this. We didn't vote for any of it.
Have we left the limited republic we were founded upon? Is 'a government of the people, by the people and for the people' a thing of the past, never to be seen again? If Barry has his way, the answer is yes, it's gone forever. He has something better in mind. Well guess what Newsweek? We the people are not happy. You think that's because we just are uncomfortable with a black man in the White House? We don't like the name Hussein? You're an idiot, Alter.
Snuck in before Alter's total whiff job is an equally inane Julia Baird piece, who offers that blacks are getting happy, and whites are less so. Who would write such drivel? Julia Baird is not likely to provide us insights into race relations. Her 'writing' comes off largely as a Glen Beck hit piece. And what are the reasons she offers for the supposed changes in happiness? Jules offers us three: first, blacks used to be very unhappy, and now they are less so. Second, it's something you can't measure, the erosion of prejudice. And the third reason? You'll never guess. The third reason is that whites have grown less happy.
Can you believe this? A Newsweek editor read and approved this article, seeing it as an informative piece on the culture we live in. How can that be?
Like you would know? When have you ever done anything other than carry the guy's water? Worthless pukes. Newsweek, as a member of the vaunted fourth estate, you have a constitutionally protected job to do.
The picture above is taken from their website - but it wasn't supposed to depict their crack reporters from the newsroom. Only Larry is looking a little askance at the liberal cool aide they are handing out.
Seriously though...look at Baird's conclusions. I swear, Moe would be right at home there. Plus, he could hand out some badly needed smacks. I think Moe should take over as news editor.
"Did you write this, Alter? You checked sources on this and have two independent sources for these wise ass claims you're making? No?!! Why you NUMBSKULLS!"
Here she is again. This time, she's wearing the knitty top of the week... (this week, it's all been about BROWN).
The knitty top was made on the knitting machine last weekend, from freebie wool (from an inherited stash). The skirt is a friend's cast-off from a few years ago (made by her - from a remnant, I suspect...).
The boots were a bargain from an op shop a few years ago and the polo-neck skivvy is from K-Mart (last year).
The model done good on very little budget! Loving the knitty top of the week, but alas, I know I could definitely not carry it off!
You are rockin that look. Skirt is a brilliant fit and the jumper looks like it came from exclusive 'one of a kind' rack at DJ's, (where it would sell for $680 big ones). You're a fashion star regardless of the price tags.
Do you have a pattern for the sweater? It is lovely. And...I love that the entire ensemble was $20. Brilliant!

John Hinderaker -- my favorite blogger on my favorite blog -- was crushed by what he sees as Paul Ryan's "weak and submissive" debate performance:
I thought Paul Ryan’s performance was highly disappointing. He came across as weak and submissive. There were many opportunities for him to turn to Biden and say, “Joe: shut up! It’s my turn.” But he never did it. I can’t imagine why. Maybe Ryan and his advisers thought Biden would come off poorly because he was such a jerk, but this strikes me as a poor strategy. No one votes for a presidential ticket out of sympathy.
Did anybody here really want to see Mad Dog Paul in the Veepbate? I know I'm awfully glad he didn't turn the debate into a steel-cage smugfest. What I saw was a candidate for Vice President debating in the normal way that such candidates always used to debate... until the Left, starting in the 2000 election, developed the delusion that Democrat domination of government was an entitlement program, like Medicare, Social Security, or crony kickbacks from green energy.
For the entirety of the third millennium, Democrats have acted as if the levers of power are theirs by divine right (provided we allow the worship of socialism to count as "divine"). When they lose, they wail, gnash their teeth, and set up a yowling that can be heard all the way to the dog star Sirius, notwithstanding the eight and a half lightyears of hard vacuum in between. The safest prediction a "pundant" could make would be that, when Barack "Video victim" Obama loses the November vote, he will immediately commence re-litigating the election... in federal court.
Paul Ryan represents the "normal style" of candidates running for high office: They have deeply held core beliefs, from which they generate policies, present them to voters, and argue that their ideas, policies, and leadership are better than their opponents'. Under the normal style in American politics, after the election, voters generally accept the outcome and consider the election to have been legitmate. Citizens, even those who opposed the winners and voted for the losers, can nevertheless come together to try to help the new government going forward; because they believe that regardless of political differences, all candidates are acting in good faith and sincerely want America to succeed.
But since the 2000 contest, we have increasingly seen, not the "paranoid style" (as Richard Hofstadter put it in 1964) but the Apocalyptic style in American politics: Democrats, liberals, and the leftover Left cast every election as Armageddon, the final battle betwixt the forces of Ultimate Evil (the "extreme, radical Right") and those of Pure Good (take a wild guess). It is an existential, all-or-nothing struggle that is so vital, so infused with the fierce urgency of Now, that it can never end unless the Left utterly conquers the world.
The Left must win every vote, every debate, every exchange of "mal mots" on cable TV, no matter how trivial; else it's irrefutable evidence of corruption and skulduggery so monstrous that investigation by a United Nations committee is the very least that should be undertaken.
(Barack Obama is the ne plus ultra of that trend; he has achieved apotheosis, and a new religion of Obamunism has sprung up among his enthused acolytes. Who but a god could promise the cool the Earth and quiet the waters, and a host of other such vows? Who but a little tin god with feet of clay could so cavalierly break all of his pledges without a scintilla of shame?)
Tonight, the Normal Style fought the Apocalyptic Style... to mixed results. On the plus side, despite Joe Biden's 316 years in the U.S. Senate, Paul Ryan easily held his own against the Delaware Dirt-Devil. My gut reaction was that Ryan won by a nose, on points; this was confirmed by the CNN snap-poll that showed Ryan winning 48 to 44.
On the minus side, he merely held his own; Ryan was unable to do to Biden what his principal, Mitt Romney, did to President Obama.
But what if Paul Ryan had taken Hinderaker's advice and gone after Biden hammer and tooth? Might he have won more decisively? Perhaps, but probably not: Being an ambulatory incendiary is Joe Biden's holy calling; it would be tough to outsnide, outsmirk, and outboor a man so perfectly bred to the task. (No matter how learned and clever you are, you'll never outstink a skunk.)
But even if Ryan rose -- all right, plummeted -- to the challenge, the real losers would be the American people... because the Apocalyptic Style would score a default judgment, having coöpted both Left and Right into amoral self-immolation; and the war of all against all would win by technicality. (The Left's favorite way!)
Instead, the American people were reminded that it doesn't have to be this way. They were jolted into remembering that political campaigns and national elections used to be intellectual choices between two futures, often starkly different but nevertheless comprehensible. (As opposed to racking up ten of trillions of dollars in debt, impoverishing the nation, emasculating the military, socializing medical care, and accelerating Obama's determination to lead from behind by pronunciamento, diktat, and decree.)
By not pulling a Howitzer out of his pants and cannonizing Biden, Ryan may have failed to annihilate the enemy tribe; but he did save us from the bestial specter of tribalism. And I count that as a very significant battlefield victory in the ongoing holy war of the Normal against the Apocalypse.
Just a quick add-on to our previous post, Vex Popular, in which we speculated that Bill Clinton's entry into the Barack "You Didn't Build That" Obama campaign would not be the smashing success for which the Left pines; the very reason that Clinton has such a high "favorability" is precisely that he has not engaged in overt political campaigning since he tried to push his lovely wife Hillary across the finishing line in 2008's Democratic presidential primary. Thus, leaping into the fray now on behalf of America's Trillion-Dollar Taxman won't boost Obama so much as it will diminish Clinton.
Former President Bill Clinton hopes to give a boost to President Barack Obama when he speaks at the Democratic national convention and places Obama’s name in nomination, but voters aren’t sure if the two agree on how to deal with the economy.
In a new Rasmussen Reports national survey, just 32 percent of likely voters said they believe Clinton and Obama hold similar views on how to fix the economy, while 39 percent think they have differing views on what’s needed. Another 29 percent are not sure....
Only 19 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of voters who are not affiliated with either major political party believe Clinton and Obama are in agreement on what economic course the country should follow.
Into that stat I read a dire implication to the Big Stick's retention as Chief Occupier. If a strong plurality of Independent voters believes that:
Bill Clinton doesn't support or agree with Obama's handling of the economy, the most important issue the looming election; in fact, he agrees more with Mitt Romney's position;
Nevertheless, Clinton is going to flog the Obama line anyway, and to heck with America's dire fiscal straits;
...Then won't voters conclude that Clinton's support for Obama is nothing but rank, knee-jerk partisanship? "My party, whether right or catastrophically wrong."
Former President Bill Clinton's popularity is polling at record highs, a factor that may give a boost to beleaguered President Barack Obama’s re-election bid.
Clinton, who will formally nominate Obama at the Democratic National Convention in September, is viewed favorably by 66 percent of Americans, tying his highest rating recorded in January 1993, Gallup found.
Gallup explains its reasoning thus; first, they show a graphic of Clinton's favorable ratings from inauguration up to today:
Clinton's solid popularity with Americans today might help attract new support to Obama from outside the party, particularly from whites, men, seniors, and political independents -- all important voting groups that Obama is struggling with in trial heats against Republican Mitt Romney.
But let's think again, starting with first principles: Where did Clinton's sky-high favorability come from?
Perhaps we can find some clues by examining its ups and downs throughout Clintonian history. Let's reflect upon Clinton's presidential and post-presidential career with a couple of questions; perhaps the answers will give us a clue to his popularity today:
Contrariwise, why did he hit a high point in 1996-1998, and why is his favorability so positive today?
By Gallup's account above, his favorability plummeted from 66% in January of 1993, when he assumed office, to 47% in late 1994, precipitating the Republican takeover of Congress in November of that year. What had happened during those two years? Bill Clinton made a campaign promise to be a uniter, not a divider; he swore he would work with the GOP; he ran as the darling of the Democratic Leadership Council of moderate, non-Progressivist Democrats. Then as soon as he was safely elected, Clinton swerved to the Left:
Pronounced the new "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" (DADT) policy for gays serving in the military. (Personally, I wish he had simply gone to the mattresses -- perhaps a bad expression regarding this particular president -- in Congress to repeal the law banning gays from serving in the military, thus allowing them to serve openly; DADT was an engraved invitation to blackmail.)
He signed the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (a.k.a. Gingrich's welfare reform) in 1996, after being seen negotiating with the Republicans for many months.
He signed the Defense of Marriage Act, protecting traditional-marriage states from having to recognize the same-sex marriages of other states (forgot about that one, didn't you?).
And he signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, also in 1996, which appeared to most voters as a reasonable compromise between compassion for illegals who had lived here peacefully for many years, including children who had been brought here as infants, and a well-justified concern for border security and the sovereign right of every country to control immigration. (Again personally, I wasn't much impressed. All hat, no steak.)
Each of these was an example of Bill Clinton "triangulating," negotiating with the more moderate members of both the Democratic and Republican parties for a working majority, rather than aligning himself with either fringe. Lo and behold, Clinton's favorability rose steadily from 1995 to 1997, when his second term began. It continued high until 1998, when Clinton's favorability started its long decline to 42% in late 2000.
Since most voters opposed Clinton's 1998 impeachment, the GOP prosecution of the president probably raised his favorability leading up to it. Too, his "bloodless" Bosnian attack seemed successful at first; but by 1998, Clinton's feckless foreign-policy sacred cows finally came home to roost:
Saddam Hussein went on a tear, slaughtering his own people with tanks, aerial bombardment, and poison gas.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom Clinton had practically shoehorned back into control of Haiti, was seen more and more as a ruthless and bloody dictator.
And of course, this period also saw a huge increase in al-Qaeda activity, culminating in their bombing of two U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 and the bombing of the USS Cole in 2000, each of which killed many Americans.
In other words, when Clinton was behaving in a bipartisan, moderate, and effective manner, voters loved him. But when he was partisan, radical, feckless, and incompetent, they despised him.
The correlation is too strong and exact to ignore; in the end, a strong majority disliked him, because they finally figured out that they'd been suckered. In reality, Clinton was always more liberal than he admitted; and voters finally realized he didn't have a dang clue what he was doing on any front, foreign or domestic.
Bill Clinton's "favorability" is not a fixed quantity, nor has it much to do with the man himself. Rather, it reflects what he has been doing lately.
Lurching back into partisan campaigning, after years of being a neutral "elder statesman," making sage pronouncements and staying "above the fray," definitely counts as changing his behavior.
In this case, by hitching the Clintonmobile to an angry, thin-skinned, radical, partisan President Obama, Clinton evokes the Bad Clinton of 1993 through 1994, not the Good Clinton of bipartisan cooperation and moderation in his liberalism.
Thus Clinton, by joining forces with Barack Obama, the wildly divisive Trillion-Dollar Taxman, makes it far more likely that Obama will drag Clinton's favorability downwards, rather than Clinton dragging Obama's favorability upwards.
The forceable recollecting of Clinton's sly, dishonest, corruption (remember his and Al Gore's campaign-financing and other financial scandals?) will likely highlight Obama's own liberal-fascist, crony-capitalist culture of corruption, funneling trillions in tax dollars to Obama's cronies and financial backers.
The Gallup pollsters make the amateurish mistake of thinking that Clinton's likeability oozes naturally from his DNA and will rub off onto anyone he buddies up to. But the reality is, by embracing Obama, Clinton will come to be seen as a political "parole violator." He will be swallowed whole by Obamunism, eventually to be spat under the bus... like everyone else who becomes an Obamic liability.
In a primetime exclusive interview, the head of the executive branch of New York City's government provided his solution for implementing stricter gun laws in America:
"I don't understand why the police officers across this country don't stand up collectively and say we're going to go on strike," Bloomberg told the "Piers Morgan Tonight" host. "We're not going to protect you unless you, the public, through your legislature, do what's required to keep us safe."
To be fair, however, Bloomberg said the next day that he didn't literally mean it and his words were taken out of context. But he still wonders why they don't literally do what he didn't literally mean anyway.
Note the liberal-Fascist, ultimatum-style argument -- government by threat and extortion. But that should hardly surprise: Michael "Mr. Conviction" Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat and the eleventh richest person in the world, switched parties to run for mayor in 2001; the Democratic field was crowded with five strong candidates, and Bloomberg reckoned he had a better shot at nomination on the GOP line, which had only one candidate.
Meanwhile, back at National Urban League convention, President Barack H. "Big Stick" Obama responds to his leftist, Progressivist base:
Faced with a clamor in his party for stricter gun control in the wake of the Colorado movie-theater massacre, President Obama said Wednesday night he would "leave no stone unturned" in seeking new measures to reduce violence nationwide, including more restrictive background checks on gun purchases.
"A lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals," Mr. Obama said at the annual National Urban League convention in New Orleans. "They belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities."
That second paragraph sounds a lot more like an "assault rifle" ban than "more restrictive background checks." But perhaps I'm just taking his words out of context.
The president blamed "politics and lobbying" for defeating gun-control measures when outcries arise after mass shootings in the U.S.
O for the good old days, when every sensational shooting produced a spontaneous, irrational, hysterical overreaction and more useless gun-control laws!
"Police officers want to go home to their families. And we're doing everything we can to make their job more difficult, but more importantly, more dangerous, by leaving guns in the hands of people who shouldn't have them and letting people who have those guns buy things like armor-piercing bullets," he detailed. "The only reason to have an armor-piercing bullet is to go through a bullet-resistant vest. The only people that wear bullet-resistant vests are our police officers."
The drumbeat continues, and our Trillion Dollar Taxman appears to be gingerly but consistently wading his way into a gun-control presidential campaign. Every day that the debate du jour is gun control, or anything else other than the miserable economy, is a good day, as far as the permanent presidential campaign is concerned. He's headed for the deep end; keep watching the skies!
But it won't work. As I said before, voters will be outraged by a condescending campaign at war with guns, when our real problem is a federal government at war with prosperity.
The White House hinted on Tuesday that President Barack Obama may address the politically sensitive issue of gun control more broadly in the aftermath of the recent shootings in Colorado....
Obama traveled to Colorado on Sunday to comfort family members and victims of the shooting at an Aurora movie theater in which 12 people died and dozens were injured. In remarks after his visit the president hinted at the prospect of a new discussion about gun control measures.
"I hope that over the next several days, next several weeks, and next several months, we all reflect on how we can do something about some of the senseless violence that ends up marring this country," he said.
On Tuesday White House spokesman Jay Carney also said Obama could talk about the issue more broadly but he declined to offer details or a time frame.
"It's certainly possible the president could address ... these issues in the future but I don't have any scheduling updates for you," Carney told reporters on Air Force One.
The title refers to the animated movie Up, wherein an intelligence-augmented dog who can talk (it's the collar) interrupts his speech, now and again, to stare wildly left or right and yelp out, "Squirrel!" It's the ideal image when thinking of Barack "Big Stick" Obama's campaign, which comprises nothing but a series of ludicrous attempted distractions from the big picture, our collapsing economy.
The ranks of America's poor are on track to climb to levels unseen in nearly half a century, erasing gains from the war on poverty in the 1960s amid a weak economy and fraying government safety net.
Food-stamp mania has struck the country. More and more Americans are applying for disability payments from the government at the same time that Americans enjoy better health than ever. Unemployment is mired in the eights, with real unemployment about 15%-16% and no relief in sight. Small-business owners and entrepreneurs are still reeling from the president's speech denigrating and insulting them.
Atop this pile of bad news for Obamunism, three new polls today tell us that Americans are souring on the president and especially on his broader thesis, that government deserves most of the credit for jobs and economic growth... and that the "previous administration" must shoulder all the blame for their lack:
One from the Hill finds that two-thirds of likely voters blame the (current) federal government for the weak economy, with a plurality saying it's mostly President Obama's fault.
According to a Rasmussen poll, 72% believe that entrepreneurs who start a business "are primarily responsible for their success or failure. Only 13 percent disagree." 77% believe entrepreneurs work harder than employees. 57% believe that entrepreneurs and small businesses do more to create jobs and grow the economy than big businesses (16%) or state and local government (11%); only 7% think that the federal government creates the most jobs and wealth. And "61 percent believe that small businesses provide more valuable service to a community than big business or government at any level."
Finally, this poll from USA Today/Gallup has a raft of noisome news for President B.O.: Mitt Romney has a "significant advantage" over Obama on "managing the economy, reducing the federal budget deficit and creating jobs;" Republicans and Republican leaners have a huge advantage in enthusiasm over Democrats and Democratic leaners; 61% of respondents say "the government is trying to do too many things that should be left to individuals and businesses." And this is from a poll of adults, not likely voters or even registered voters; likely voters would be even more pro-Romney.
And what is the response of America's Trillion-Dollar Taxman to this incessant threnody of electoral woe?
President Barack Obama dashed to Colorado on Sunday to meet with families of those gunned down in a movie theater and to hear from state and local officials about the shooting that left 12 people dead and dozens more injured.
Many argue that the visit was a wonderful, heartfelt attempt to reach out and comfort those in dire need of it, who have lost loved ones including children, wives, husbands, and other beloveds. The elected officials of Aurora are convinced that the president's visit was a vital part of the grieving process:
"These families need that kind of contact by our elected leader," said the Aurora police chief, Dan Oates. "It will be very powerful and it will help them. As awful as what they've been through and what they're going through has been having the president here is very, very powerful, it means a great deal to them and all of Aurora," he told CBS'"Face the Nation."
"I think the president coming in is a wonderful gesture," said Aurora's mayor, Steve Hogan. "He's coming in, really, to have private conversations with the families. I think that's totally appropriate." Hogan told ABC's "This Week" that it "certainly means a lot to Aurora to know that the president cares."
But does it really? Does it truly comfort the grieving when the President of the United States shows up with full entourage, trailing a bus-sized complement of paparazzi, and turns grief into a very public spectacle with distinctly political overtones? Particularly when the grieving and the wounded know full well, as do we all, that at least one purpose of the presidential visit to Aurora is to buttress Obama's reelection bid.
I don't speak for anyone else, but I can tell you that the absolute last thing I would want, were I in a situation I don't even want to think about, the very last thing, would be to abruptly discover myself to have become an integral part of a presidential campaign event... even if I liked the president in question. (With this president, such forced exploitation would be intolerable.)
But I have the feeling that this burst of "compassion" is more than just a momentary bolt, a duck and fade, a quick trip to avoid, for another couple of days, grabbing the bear by the tail and looking the economic facts in the face. Rather, I think there is a distinct possibility that this shooting might transform and refocus the Obama campaign on the next new squirrel, a distraction that could possibly carry them all the way to November without Obama ever having to articulate a solution to our fiscal crisis.
The Permanent Progressivist Presidential Campaign might decide to base their entire campaign on a nationwide series of repressive gun-control laws. He could, for example, make a point of signing the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty (assuming it get finalized in time), then making great theater of saying he'll present it to the Senate for approval after the election (because he doesn't want to "politicize" such an urgent and vital issue).
This will allow him to ride the gun-control hobby horse, clinging to the pommel until the bell rings on November 6th, without ever having to show any results for all that sound and fury.
Again I caution, this is sheer speculation, a "might," not a "will;" I have no hard evidence of this, since it hasn't happened yet. Consider this merely a musing with a heads-up.
But there are portents; Sen. Diane Feinstein (D-CA, 90%) and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-NY, 80%) have already waved the obligatory bloody shirt, demanding we cast aside our essential liberty and do something about those awful guns. That supplies the framework on which Obama can hang his new campaign theme.
It's easy enough to coax other anti-gun extremists, never shy about publicizing their cause, to redirect, repeat, and retweet the clarion call. Just look how easy it was, as Korso points out below, for ABC chief investigative reporter Brian Ross tried to falsely blame Tea Partiers for the Aurora shootings with breathtaking alacrity. How many Americans heard (and believed) the accusation but not the retraction? A concerted anti-gun campaign could drum up hundreds of voices, from shrill to solemn, from measured moderation to maximum madness, to try to pull off the greatest presidential-election misdirection of all time.
With so many "reputable" sources blaming this shooting on the guns wielded by that ghoul, can the White House itself lag far behind? How long until some genius in the Permanent Campaign realizes the opportunity that has just been handed to them, the ultimate distraction from that which they cannot discuss?
We are continually lectured that we should not "politicize" tragedy, generally by liberal "instructors" doing precisely that. Republicans and conservatives rightly see themselves as much better mannered than Democrats and liberals; but the latter exploit that Republican reserve and dance, booted and spurred, upon our politesse. And despite the effrontery, they make great inroads in the meme wars by doing exactly what they demand the rest of us to abjure.
Consider the case of Hurricane Katrina: George W. Bush did more to mitigate damage and prepare for the disaster, even before that catastrophic storm, than any president in history. In the immediate aftermath, the Left warned the president, in stentorian and censorious voice, not to politicize the devastation -- then instantly fell to attacking Bush for his "incompetence," "disconnect," and "indifference."
The president, in an excess of good manners and basic decency, refused to fight back; and the Left had the airwaves all to themselves for many days. The result was that the false stench of presidential failure was firmly established, despite reams of evidence that the response to Hurricane Katrina was perhaps the best example of federal disaster response. Today, even most conservatives have been brainwashed into seeing Katrina as the nadir of Bush's presidency. Worse, it colored Americans' perception of his entire tenure, and perhaps helped saddle us with the current Occupier in Chief.
We must not enable yet another one-sided war in the name of seemliness, when those who would destroy America from within -- for example, by obliterating our cherished right to keep and bear arms -- are about as unseemly as it's possible to imagine. If I offend, I won't apologize; the loss of traditional American virtues is too dire to be held hostage to inappropriate silence.
Let us be clear what I suggest and what I do not. First, there is no chance in Hades that the Arms Trade Treay could garner 67 votes in the Senate; there are already 57 senators who have come out against it, at least as envisioned by the anti-gun crowd.
But that's irrelevant to the Progressivist point. Obama need not actually enact gun control or confiscation; he need only change the subject (again) away from the economy to something else, anything else.
Many Americans would be "up in arms" about such a bait and switch. But with the stakes so high -- four more years of Obamunism to finish transforming our nation -- the Obama campaign might well calculate that the ill-will generated by going after guns is the lesser of two evils.
Look at the size of the hole they've already dug on jilted jobs, guttering growth, risible regulations, and just plain mean-spirited mudslinging at "the rich," which today appears to mean everybody not ensconced beneath the liberally defined and infinitely movable "poverty" line.
Obama cannot fix or even staunch the bleeding of our economy, because that would require the Big Stick to embrace Capitalism and the free market, anathema to Progressivists. But his other option is a simplistic, "black and white" battle cry: "Cling" to evil, talismanic guns, and you'll have a bunch of dead innocents in movie theaters.
And every minute spent discussing something other than the economy is a minute precious and helpful to Barack Obama.
But in the end, I believe this (speculative) distraction would explode in the president's face like a trick cigar, as have all the other sleights he has tried. Obama's biggest and most intractable problem is that he fundamentally does not understand what it means to be American, proudly American, uniquely American. I don't care where the man was born, he is not one of us.
If the president gives in to his baser instincts and his clueless advisors, or the other way 'round; if he pulls the trigger on running a "gun-control campaign;" he will discover that the roots of American independence stretch much deeper than he could possible imagine. Even many liberals would be outraged by a campaign at war with guns, when our problem is a government at war with prosperity.
So if that's the direction the permanent campaign has chosen, bring it on. I have no proof that gun control is their Plan B, and I'm certainly not making such a prediction; there are so many other distractions to choose from! But an anti-firearms campaign knits together so many threads that Progressivists love that I cannot imagine they haven't at least kicked the gong around.
I've been fretting about one of the four recall elections against Republican senators in the Cheesy State. I understand that as of the day before the election, Republicans very narrowly held the state senate, 17 to 16; thus if any one of the four senators undergoing recall proceedings lost his election, the senate would switch to Democratic control by the same margin.
In three of the races, the Republican incumbents won easily; but in the other race, District 21, the Democratic challenger, John Lehman, is ahead of GOP incumbent Van Wanggaard by 779 votes. I fretted that we -- that is, lovers of individual liberty and Capitalism, as opposed to the lovers of thuggish public-employee unions -- would win the big battle to save Gov. Scott Walker but lose the tiny skirmish over one state-senate race, stymying total victory. I pictured brutal gridlock, with the Left refusing to allow any bill or appropriation to move, no matter how urgent or bipartisan, unless Walker and the legislature agreed to undo everything Walker has done up until now.
Easing the loss for Republicans is the fact that the Senate has already adjourned its regular business for the year and that a new set of legislative district maps approved by GOP lawmakers last year will give their party a strong chance of reclaiming the Senate in November's elections.
"It's a nice moral victory for the Democrats -- it gives them something to hang their hat on," said Joe Heim, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. "But I think the November election will very likely undo what happened on Tuesday."
Specifically, Lehman wouldn't have to face a GOP opponent until 2014, unless the GOP calls another recall election after the November general election... which seems extraordinarily unlikely to me, since Wisconsonians are already suffering from "recall fatigue." Either way, the next vote will be held under the newly redistricted map, which favors Republicans.
If [the District 21 election result] holds up, Tuesday's victory for Democrats could be undone in November.
Republicans have their sights on the seats held by Democratic Sens. Jim Holperin of Conover and Jessica King of Oshkosh. Holperin is retiring and King is new to the Senate, having won a recall race in August against then-Sen. Randy Hopper of Empire.
"It's not a big hit," Sen. Mike Ellis (R-Neenah) said. "We're going to have the majority back in November."
Sen. Carl Levin (D-MI, 95%), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has forced not one, not two, but three investigations -- two by the Pentagon and one by the Government Accounting Office; Levin insists there simply must be something crooked about former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's program to enlist retired military officers (RMOs) to analyze and explain the Iraq and Afghanistan war efforts to the people. Where there's hokey smoke, there oughta be fire... or at least an awful lot of hot air.
Somewhere, somehow, some RMO simply must have gotten cash under the table from Rumsfeld for talking up the wars; they can't have all actually believed in what they did!
Alas for the Chairman, all three investigations turned up bubkes. Zip. A big, fat bagel. Thank goodness there's nothing important going on in the country that might require the Senate's attention.
Now Chairman Levin, facing the possibility of becoming a Senate laughingstock for his failed Inspecteur Clouseau Javert-like persecution, is reduced to begging the Pentagon to throw him a bone, something disreputable enough to justify his obsession. Say, couldn't they at least allow the Chairman and his staff to rewrite the report to Levin's (and his party's) satisfaction?
The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee is intervening with a Pentagon investigator to influence the final wording of a report that exonerates George W. Bush-era officials who gave war briefings to retired military TV and radio commentators.
Sen. Carl Levin, Michigan Democrat, has tried for three years to convince federal investigators that the briefing program violated government rules and that some of the retired officers turned analysts received preferential treatment for Pentagon contracts....
A source close to the third probe said that a Levin staffer, committee general counsel Peter Levine, has engaged in written communication with John Crane, the Pentagon inspector general’s congressional liaison.
The source said the communication is designed to convince Mr. Crane that wording should be added to the findings that criticize the analyst program devised by staff for Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. [Emphasis added -- DaH]
Ah yes, the lone whistleblower, crying in the wilderness: "You can't handle the truth!" But the truth may oft be inconvenient:
Two previous government probes found no misconduct, and the Pentagon inspector general now has wrapped up a third investigation....
The findings, as written, say the program followed Defense Department rules, the source told The Washington Times.
All this reminds me of one of the few scenes in the television show M*A*S*H that I found genuinely funny. Season 10 had a two-parter titled "Snap Judgment"/"Snappier Judgment"; it was the double-episode where Sgt. Klinger (post-transvestite phase) is accused of stealing a Polaroid instant camera and trying to sell it on the Korean black market. He is eventually brought up before a general court-martial.
Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester III volunteers to be Klinger's defense "attorney," despite having no legal training whatsoever. He botches the case (naturally); and Klinger is standing on the bring of being wrongly convicted when Dr. Winchester gives his closing argument. I can't find the exact quotation, but it goes something like this: "Before you render your verdict, think about me! Think of my reputation. No Winchester has ever lost a legal case; if I lose here -- I'll be ruined!"
At least Maj. Winchester was honest about his real motive, which is more than I can say, sadly enough, for Sen. Levin.
A friend of mine frets that today's capture and execution of Muammar Qaddafi will change the dynamic of the 2012 presidential election, starting a cascade of support for the embattled incumbent that will allow him to eke out a narrow victory. Many readers may likewise worry that this putative "victory" for Barack H. Obama will "turn the tide," undoing everything conservatives, tea partiers, and even Republicans have done to try to restore fiscal and regulatory sanity to the country, along with the blessing of liberty that are now so imperiled.
But I reject the very premise that this happy death will affect Obama's electoral chances whatsoever. Here's why.
President B.O. has long since proven himself a fool as far as actual governance goes; but if he tries to grab credit for the death of Qaddafi, killed by as yet unknown rebels within the anti-Qaddafi alliance very loosely controlled by the so-called National Transitional Council, Obama will prove himself a fool even as a politician.
(As of this moment, AP is trying to push the meme that Qaddafi's death is part of "a string of foreign policy victories this year for the Obama administration" for Obama; but the President himself is disclaiming personal credit. For a man as conceited as he, that can only mean even he thinks it will not be helpful to his campaign. Consider: The killing of Osama bin Laden was clearly of tremendously greater significance to Americans than the killing of Qaddafi; yet the former assassination yielded only a two-week blip in Obama's approval polling, before it resumed its slide towards Obamic irrelevancy.)
So why doesn't this "victory" translate into a big boost to Obama's faltering reelection campaign, even on the foreign-policy front?
The death of Qaddafi does not signify the end of hostilities; it signals only the transition from rebellion against tyranny to full civil war. The NTC controls nothing; there are countless armed militias and armies based in many different regions throughout what used to be called Libya (I say that because I expect the country to fracture into several countries -- de facto if not de jure!) These armed groups will never peacefully surrender their arms (hence their power) to any one of the many factions; they will fight their way to a seat at the big table. Does Obama really want to claim "credit" for a massive civil war with tens or hundreds of thousands of dead in a failed nation of only six and a half million?
Because Obama tried to do this on the cheap, without sending any serious contingent of the American military, we shall have next to nothing to say about the ultimate configuration (if any) that X-Libya takes. It could easily end up more like Afghanistan than like Turkey or Iraq, and might even be more like Iran. Does Obama really want to claim credit for Libya going from a brutal fascist dictatorship under Qaddafi to a brutal, radical-Islamist dictatorship under a Muslim Brotherhood-based terrorist coalition?
Any putative political benefit the administration might hope to gain due from the Libyan situation already happened when Qaddafi was driven from power months ago; the dénouement of Qaddafi's bodily death is actually an anticlimax. It will likely produce nothing but a shrug from voters before they return to worrying about the economy and Obamacare.
Finally, the entire country knows that Obama tried to "lead from behind" in the Libya adventure; he refused even to take the lead role in the NATO involvement, let alone the lead role in the fighting.
We mostly fought with drone planes armed with Hellfire missiles. While this reticence may have been justified, given the uncertainty of outcome, the One cannot then turn around and believably claim to be Dwight David Eisenhower, or even David Petraeus. We did little, and the whole world knows it.
Maybe it was a good we did little; frankly, I wish we had done even less. But passive acquiescence isn't the "right stuff" on which a jubilant reelection is founded. I believe that Obama has maybe a 30% chance of being reelected; weirder things have happened in presidential years. But the chance that the death of Qaddafi will in any way influence the American presidential election is nil, as near as makes no difference.
The 2012 election -- like every presidential election -- will turn on three cosmic issues, none of which lines up in Obama's favor:
The voters' assessment of Obama's character and tenure, which at the moment is hovering just slightly above the similar assessment of George W. Bush in 2008.
This assessment alone is the strongest force pushing towards Obama's defeat: As president, he comes across as weak, vain, vacillating, pompous, incompetent, cowardly, bullying, and peevish; and his policies have almost uniformly enraged the electorate ever since the passage of Obamacare (without a single Republican vote).
The continuing and deteriorating economic situation, exacerbated by policies such as the trillion-dollar stimulus; the failed attempt at a second, half-trillion-dollar bride of stimulus; the tax increases; continual threats of more punitive actions against "the rich" and more redistributionist policies; the staggering number of major, new regulations inhibiting business from recovering; the terrible economic uncertainties stemming from Obamacare; Obama's war on fossil fuels and nuclear power, which has crippled our ability to develop sufficient energy to run a rich country of 300 million souls; and the economic "epistemic closure" of the minds of his advisors and cabinet members, the pandemic of ignorance about Capitalism actually works, which has ripped through the organs of government like fast-moving financial neurovirus, leaving every public civic agency and institution in a state of anti-market madness.
The utter folly of Obama's foreign policy, notwithstanding AP's "string of foreign policy victories." This election, foreign policy is of lesser impact than the other two elements of reelection; but it's still significant, both for the disrespect and mockery which other countries now turn upon America (where once was respect and even fear), and also for the forced kow-towing to Red China (we're so desperate for their investment, which keeps us from total collapse), and our inexplicable, fatalist acquiescence to the provocations of Iran.
Iran's obvious contempt for us as adversary rose to a crescendo with the massive terrorist bombings Iran tried to perpetrate on American soil, attacks thwarted only because the FBI and DEA took time out from their busy schedule of funneling automatic weapons to Mexican drug lords to befool the Iranian agent at the core of the terrorist attacks.
Those three questions -- assessment of the first term, of the economic state of the Union, and of foreign policy -- are the three legs of the reelection stool for any president. They vary in respective importance from election to election, depending on the situation; but taken together, they nearly always determine the outcome. And the voters' assessments of President B.O. are in freefall on all three fronts.
Can Obama turn it all around in the remaining twelvemonth? It would take divine (or diabolical) intervention to reverse the trendline and pull off what would be the greatest electoral comeback in American history.
But even the possibility of such intervention is stifled by Obama himself, who appears, astonishingly, to believe that he's been a spectacularly good president, that he still enjoys the 70% approval he had right after being elected, and that the people simply love his policies; he thus sees no reason to change even jot or tittle of policy or demeanor. The President thinks that all he must do to be swept into a second term by general acclamation -- possibly without even the fuss and feathers of an election -- is just explain himself better, so the rabble understand his transcendent brilliance and how lucky America is that he has deigned to become our philosopher king. He thinks that he needs only give another speech or two, or fifty, and all will be well.
But for most Americans and for some time now, his speeches have had the opposite effect: They solidify dissent and convince voters that Obama is even more clueless today than in 2008. When charged with being all hat and no cattle, the very worst defense the accused can offer is -- another speech!
For these and many other reasons sufficient to my mind, I cannot see Barack H. Obama managing to pull yet another rabbit out of his sleeve. He had a phenomenal run of luck in 2008, both in world events and in picking the perfect opponent; but such "perfect storms" happen only once in a century. To slightly paraphrase George Orwell, the liberal-fascist octopus has sung its swan song.
And here's Peter Orszag, former Director of the Office of Management and Budget under Barack H. Obama, writing in the New Republic (clipped from the free excerpt):
To solve the serious problems facing our country, we need to minimize the harm from legislative inertia by relying more on automatic policies and depoliticized commissions for certain policy decisions. In other words, radical as it sounds, we need to counter the gridlock of our political institutions by making them a bit less democratic.
Speaking at the Cary Rotary Club, here's North Carolina Gov. Beverly Eaves "Bev" Perdue (a liberal Democrat -- and if you didn't already know, this quotation should make it plain):
You have to have more ability from Congress, I think, to work together and to get over the partisan bickering and focus on fixing things. I think we ought to suspend, perhaps, elections for Congress for two years and just tell them we won't hold it against them, whatever decisions they make, to just let them help this country recover. I really hope that someone can agree with me on that. The one good thing about Raleigh is that for so many years we worked across party lines. It's a little bit more contentious now but it's not impossible to try to do what's right in this state. You want people who don't worry about the next election.
If Gov. Perdue is worrying about the next congressional (and presidential) elections, she's got good reason!
Tomorrow marks the final round of recall elections in tattered and bedraggled Wisconsin. I suspect Badger-State voters are thoroughly disgusted, worn out, and getting angrier by the minute; but they can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel.
But of course, Wisconsin Democrats are already plotting yet another round of recall elections in 2012, the moment Republicans elected in 2010 are eligible for being recalled. Evidently, waiting all those months for the normal elections in November is just too great a burden for the Left to be asked to bear.
Attention: Due to the present economic emergency and energy crisis, the light at the end of the tunnel has been temporarily turned off. Please check back later.
Current polling is wildly divergent: What appears to be a conservative web site, Red Racing Horses, commissioned a poll by We Ask America that found the Holperin-Simac race to be within two points; by contrast, the Daily Kos commissioned a poll from Public Policy Polling (PPP, affiliated with the Democratic National Committee) that found Holperin ahead of Ms. Simac by 14 points, 55-41.
Everyone seems to agree that Democrat Wirch in the other race is in a better position than Holperin; at least, Wirch appears to be favored against his challenger by both sides.
Both polls are for public consumption -- that is, for propaganda and get-out-the-vote (GOTV) purposes, so it's hard to take either of them seriously; there are many ways to manipulate the results of a poll, if that is your intent (which it likely is in both cases). Besides, the Washington Post's Rachel Weiner suggests that both polls are "automated," meaning robo-calls where respondents, whoever they are, poke buttons on the phone to indicate their preferences:
Polls are not much help in predicting the contests’ outcome. Republicans are touting an automated survey that showed the race for Holperin’s seat as too-close-to-call. Democrats counter by pointing to an automated poll that shows both Holperin and Wirch with double-digit leads. (The Washington Post does not publish automated poll results.)
Such polls can be well conducted or utterly meaningless, depending on how well they control for getting the specific respondents they're targeting (rather than the fourteen year old babysitter who answers that evening) and how persistent they are (to avoid the self-selection fallacy). But the WaPo sees both races as volatile and close:
"Our polling shows a bump [in the Holperin race] after last Tuesday’s election, that it’s neck and neck," said Adam Temple, spokesperson for the Republican State Leadership Committee. "It’s anybodys race at this point."
Polling suggesting these races should be easy is wrong,” said Kelly Steele, spokesman for the labor coalition We Are Wisconsin. "Anyone in the know here will tell you Holperin is a toss-up, and the activity on the ground in the district ... along with the huge TV dump on the Republican side suggests they’re definitely pulling out all the stops. Wirch is safer, but by no means a lock."
Those who can remember all the way back to last Tuesday will recall that the Democrats needed to win three of the six recall elections against the Republicans, but they won only two. That leaves Republicans still in control of the state Senate... but by the thinnest possible margin. Democrats are already wooing several Republicans, hoping to get a defection -- always a distinct possibility when only one is needed: When politicians are told they can name their own price, it takes a stronger character than most of them possess to stand on principle.
But if the GOP can capture one or both of the two Democratic seats up for grabs tomorrow, that will make it much less likely that any Republican will defect. Who in the world would want to be the only defecter when two are needed? He would be defecting from the majority to the minority!
I believe the safest bet is to assume the Holperin race will be close, thus will be won by GOTV -- how many voters each side can motivate to the ballot booth. I suspect turnout for both races will be significantly lower than last week's, since the majority in the Wisconsin state Senate is no longer at stake; that means activists will be much more important, both pro and con.
I can't begin to predict the outcome; but then, neither can anybody else, except partisans confidently prophesying a landslide for their guy (or gal, in Simac's case). But keep watching the styes for tomorrow's tumult!
President Obama’s senior political adviser David Plouffe said Wednesday that people won’t vote in 2012 based on the [greater than 9%] unemployment rate.
I've been toying with the reapportionment numbers triggered by the 2010 Census, and it's rather interesting. (Well, interesting to math folks.)
My first curiosity was how the current reapportionment (and the 2000 one) would have altered the 2000 election. In that contest between George W. Bush and Al "Lawfare" Gore, Bush prevailed by an electoral score of 271 to Gore's 266. (In 2000, one of D.C.'s three electors abstained instead of voting for Gore, who won the District; thus Gore only got 266 votes instead of the 267 he actually earned.)
But following the two reapportionments -- that is, adjusting the states won by each party according to the newest electoral-vote count for each state -- the result in 2012 would be 285 for the Republican and 253 for the Democrat; in other words, Gore could have won up to 15 more electoral votes than he did, one or two (or three or four!) extra states, yet still have lost by a clear majority of electoral votes, 270 to 268... that's how much strength the Republicans have gained since 2000 by population growth and shifting alone.
Side issue: I just read a risible article on Newsmax.com titled Census Won't Help GOP in 2012 Presidential Race, the take-home of which is this:
Any gains that flow to Republicans in Congress because of redistricting after the 2010 census are not likely to carry over to the 2012 presidential race, The New York Times FiveThirtyEight political blog reports. President Barack Obama, for example, would have won the White House in 2010 even if the electoral college then had looked like it will in 2012.
In fact, FiveThirtyEight’s Nate Silver writes, “the outcome of every presidential election in the past century would have been the same had the new numbers been used.”
This has to be one of the stupidest articles ever written. What the headline writer actually meant was not that reapportionment "won't help GOP in 2012," but rather than reapportionment has never been determinative... which is trivially true, as it's rare that the electoral college vote is so close that a swing of fifteen electoral votes (EVs) would switch it; and in the 2000 election -- when it was that close and even closer -- the winning party is also the party that saw electoral improvement due to reapportionment.
But consider: If any small states (adding up to 15 or fewer EVs) on Bush's side had fallen to Gore, then Algore would have won the electoral vote by 269 to 268 or better. And if that had happened, then had 2011's electoral numbers been in effect, they would indeed have reversed the outcome. So it's not only possible that reapportionment could make the difference, it could have done so in an election we all vividly remember!
In the 2008 election, Barack H. Obama won a lot more states than did Al Gore -- 28 states (not counting the one Nebraska electoral vote that went to Obama), eight more than Gore; and of course, several of those states were very significant: Virginia (13 EVs), North Carolina (15), Ohio (20), and the whopper, Florida (27). This propelled the Democrat to a resounding victory of 365 to 173.
But with the 2010 shift, those same states would have given Obama an electoral-college count of only 359 to 179, making it a little easier for the Republican to make up the difference in 2012.
The states that flipped between the razor-close 2000 election and the substantial Democrat victory of 2008 were:
The six (out of nine) states depicted above in bold italics enjoyed major Republican gains in the 2010 election, making them very strong candidates for flipping back to the Republicans in the 2012 presidential election. As you can see, those states would yield an electoral GOP pickup of 84 electoral votes, based upon their EVs in 2010; when we add in the changes from the 2010 reapportionment, that EV switch drops to 83: Florida gains two seats, but Ohio loses two, for a wash; then Nevada -- which I assume doesn't switch and stays with Obama -- gains one. If these six states actually switch back to the Republicans in 2012, that would make the total 275 (Dem) to 263 (Rep).
This still leaves the GOP slightly short; but flipping just seven electoral votes would bring victory to Republicans and defeat to Obamunism. For example, flipping any one of the states of Iowa, North Carolina, or Pennsylvania would do it, three states that Obama won (relatively) narrowly.
So perhaps that's the GOP game plan: Focus on the states that flipped from R to D between 2000 and 2008 and go after those that seemed to be returning to the fold in the 2010 mid-terms; then try to pick off at least one other state whose devotion to Obama looked a little weak in 2008.
That scenario also implies that a victory over Obama in 2012 is likely to be pretty thin... which not only means the reapportionment is likelier to be determinative but also raises the specter of the Hewitt Hypothesis Corollary: If it is close, they can cheat.
Unless of course the electorate has soured even more on Barack H. Obama and Obamunism two years from now than they did in the elections this November, in which case a myriad of viable routes to Republican victory present themselves. But that happy thought requires, I believe, at least one of three extraordinary circumstances:
Obama manages to economically infuriate voters even further -- perhaps by vetoing many attempts by the GOP to improve the economy, followed by an anemic rise in employment (or even a further drop), so that Obama takes the blame for it.
We suffer a huge terrorist attack that the American people blame on Obama's feckless national-security policy.
Or a hitherto unknown Republican presidential candidate rises who truly captures the imagination of the voters; not another Ronald Reagan, who would already be known right now, but perhaps a Republican version of Obama -- though with more and better substance, one hopes!
Naturally, none of these three is predictable or reliable; and if the last is to occur, it must begin within the first couple of quarters of calendar 2011. At this point, I would put my money on a very close presidential election in 2012... with the result unknown right down to the wire, and in which we'll be very glad for those extra few EVs from reapportionment.
We used to say there were two major parties in the United States: The Corrupt Party and the Stupid Party; and most of us reading this blog are members of the latter.
A food safety bill that has burned up precious days of the Senate’s lame-duck session appears headed back to the chamber because Democrats violated a constitutional provision requiring that tax provisions originate in the House.
By pre-empting the House’s tax-writing authority, Senate Democrats appear to have touched off a power struggle with members of their own party in the House. The Senate passed the bill Tuesday, sending it to the House, but House Democrats are expected to use a procedure known as “blue slipping” to block the bill, according to House and Senate GOP aides.
The debacle could prove to be a major embarrassment for Senate Democrats, who sought Tuesday to make the relatively unknown bill a major political issue by sending out numerous news releases trumpeting its passage.
Note that this guff about tax bills needing to originate in the House, not the Senate, is not just a congressional regulation or even a law; it come straight from the United States Constitution, Article I, section 7:
All bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.
Although there was a previous version of this bill that did originate in the House in 2009, it seems that Senate Democrats added "a set of fees that are classified as revenue raisers;" that triggers the constitutional concerns (and Democrat embarassment).
Majority Leader Harry "Pinky" Reid (D-Caesar's Palace, 95%) can try to ram it through the Senate again after (if) the House wastes time passing it.
Or Reid can just drop the issue -- and look even more of an ass, after that PR blitz -- to focus on the DREAM Act, granting amnesty and full voting rights to any illegal immigrant willing to swear allegiance to the Corrupt and Stupid Party.
This is not the first time that Reid has run afoul of the Constitution’s tax origination provisions. His efforts to pass a tourism promotion bill that was key to his re-election hopes was temporarily stymied earlier this year because the Senate passed a version with revenue raisers similar to those in the food safety bill.
Scott Johnson of Power Line posted today about the Senate GOP's letter to Reid, in which they promised to filibuster all bills until and unless Congress (a) passes a budget, and (b) rejects the built-in tax increase that the Democrats forced into George W. Bush's tax cut bill of 2001. Scott concluded his post thus:
The letter is a good idea, but couldn't they have signed off on it before the Senate passed the stupid and misguided Nanny state food bill on Monday?
In his remarks, Mr. Bayh expressed frustration at what he described as an increasingly polarized atmosphere in Washington that made it impossible to get anything done.
“For some time, I have had a growing conviction that Congress is not operating as it should,” he said. “There is much too much partisanship and not enough progress. Too much narrow ideology and not enough practical problem solving.”
This was a Senate seat that the Democrats already marked down as a dead-cert hold; but now it's just one more open seat in a state that went for Barack H. Obama by the narrowest of margins (50-49) in the heavily Democratic year of 2008. But that was thirteen months and a thousand years ago; a poll of Obama's support in Indiana today would find probably find 35%-40% job approval, with even lower marks for Congress.
Conservative former Republican Sen. Dan Coats (Wolf Howling's best friend!) was already edging his way into the race against Bayh; with Bayh out, the edging will likely turn into a sprint, and then a stampede, as several other Republicans join the wild hunt. Indiana is now an excellent opportunity for another Republican pickup.
Reading between the lines, I don't believe Bayh is leaving because he thinks he can't win; rather, he's leaving because he's disenchanted by today's Democratic Party:
He cited two recent examples of the Senate not stepping up – the voting down of a bipartisan commission to deal with the federal deficit and the stymied attempt to craft a jobs bill....
Mr. Bayh had been growing increasingly discontent with the Senate, an associate said, and told some advisers in 2006, when he briefly explored a presidential bid, that he did not know whether he would seek re-election to the Senate. He was seen by some fellow Democrats as someone who was not very active in the chamber on a daily basis. He often popped in for votes and was quickly gone, only occasionally giving floor speeches. He was also known to make time for the school and sports events of his children. [Great Scott, sounds like a conservative! -- DaH]
In the past two years, Mr. Bayh has been focused on budget and fiscal issues and frustrated some of his colleagues by balking at the Democratic budget proposals. According to analysis by The Times of Mr. Bayh’s voting history, he has voted with a majority of the Democratic caucus roughly 71 percent of the time during the 111th Congress — the lowest percentage of his career. (He has also been the Senate Democrat least likely to vote with the party this Congress.)
We may be seeing the beginning of a flood of disenchanted Democrats, the radioactive fallout of the Obamacle's scorched-earth radicalism: Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT, 85% Dem) was driven out of the party for being insufficiently belligerent and bellicose; Majority Leader Harry "Pinky" Reid (D-Caesar's Palace, 70%) has moved sharply to the left since the inauguration; Squeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Haight-Ashbury, 100%) is practically running the Senate. Many Democrats who are not in Ted Kennedy-land must be finding the environment much like Yellowstone National Park: scalding hot and stinking like rotten eggs.
They've seen Republicans retake seats that switched to the Democrats in 2008; and in some cases, like Scott Brown grabbing Kennedy's seat, winning seats that have been Democratic since the Cretaceous Period. Like the dinosaurs of that time, Democrats are starting to go politically extinct.
Keep watching the skies, and expect more and more defections, rejections, and insurrections over the next couple of months; 2010 could turn out to be a bigger year for the GOP than 1994.
UPDATE: John Hinderaker at Power Line passes along a rumor that the next Democratic senator out the door will be Barbara Mikulski (D-MD, 95%). The skies, I tells ya; keep watching the skies!
The latest electoral drop-out is (drum roll)... Rep. Patrick Kennedy (D-RI, 100%), scion of the late Sen. Ted Kennedy. P. Kennedy has just declared that he will not seek reelection... for a race in which he was a shoe-in for another (ninth) term:
The decision comes less than a month after a stunning upset by Republican Scott Brown in the race for the Massachusetts Senate seat his father held for almost half a century. Last week, as Brown was sworn into the seat, Patrick Kennedy called Brown's candidacy a "joke" and predicted Brown would betray his union supporters.
Kennedy did not give a reason for his decision, but he began the message by saying it had been a difficult few years for many people, then segued into the death of his father.
"Illness took the life of my most cherished mentor and confidante, my ultimate source of spirit and strength," he said, as a black-and-white photo of him as a boy sailing with his father appeared on the screen. "From the countless lives he lifted, to the American promise he helped shape, my father taught me that politics at its very core was about serving others."
This means that yet another Democratic congressional seat is up for grabs. Kennedy was so favored in the race, primary and general, that no other Democrat bothered to file against him for the primary; any Democrat starting now is already behind the power curve.
The only Republican in the race, state Rep. John Loughlin, has been working with Brown's campaign team, the Shawmut Group, and was raising money. But Kennedy was heavily favored to win the race: Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans more than 4 to 1 in Rhode Island. Loughlin has little statewide recognition, and Kennedy had four times as much campaign cash on hand coming into the year.
He told The Providence Journal shortly after Brown's win in January that he wasn't worried about Loughlin, saying "bring it on."
What weaves all these threads together is a common theme of "winning" debate -- legislative, administrative, judicial, and academic -- by gagging the opposition, by mandating assent, by locking out dissenters, and by throwing freedom of speech under the bus of the permanent campaign.
Bearing that in mind, here's another datum; this comes from the post "Free speech for me - not for thee," by Mark J. Fitzgibbons; I think you'll see the relevance:
I recently received a direct mail fundraising appeal from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) that contained a premium (direct mail term for ‘freebie'). The letter was signed by Senator John Kerry. The premium was a flexible magnet, the type people put on their refrigerators and such.
Silence them? Does the fundraising appeal also include a free SEIU t-shirt and standard-issue truncheon?
The Democratic Party fantasizes that it's "the party of dissent." It's certainly true that an inordinate number of Democrats were "dissidents" when they were young; but that was when Richard Nixon was president, for the older members -- or when Ronald Reagan was president, for the rest (including the current president, Barack H. Obama). That is, these radicals only dissented to Republican or conservative ideas; by contrast, they accepted the ideological ravings of the Left with uncritical cheerleading... and for the most part, they still do.
Thus they're not really the party of dissent; they're the party of anti-Rightism. But now that the shoe is on the other hand, and wishy-washy leftism has become the establishment, dissent seems to the new power elite, to put it bluntly, unAmerican.
First, as widely reported, since gaining control of both chambers of the Congress, Democrats have moved to shut Republicans completely out of most policy debates -- at times even changing the locks on House committee rooms to keep the GOP from mucking things up by joining the discussion:
Last Thursday [October 15th, 2009], the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee was set to hold a routine business meeting. Before the session, its ranking Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa (Calif.), made clear that he planned to call for the panel to subpoena Bank of America for documents related to Countrywide Financial Corp.'s infamous "Friends of Angelo" VIP mortgage program....
When Thursday's committee meeting began, however, the Democrats were absent, and Republican members said they waited for more than half an hour before being told the session had been canceled because of scheduling conflicts. Democrats, meanwhile, were meeting in a private room behind the hearing room.
A Republican aide saw the Democrats scuttling out of this backroom and videotaped them, posting the video on YouTube and the GOP website.
On Monday, panel Democrats had the lock changed on the door leading from the GOP's office space into the main hearing room. They did so, Towns' office said, because Republicans "don't know how to behave."
Rather than castigate these House Democrats, party members across the nation cheered them on, hooting and mocking the "defeated" Republicans. Defeated? Why yes... they were stopped from participating in their own committee meeting, a glorious victory!
More glorious victories followed; they roll upon one another like waves against the shorline. Yesterday, lefty Joshua Micah Marshall, who runs Talking Points Memo (now called just "TPM," rather like how Kentucky Fried Chicken turned into KFC, and the International House of Pancakes mysteriously morphed into IHOP) reported the Democratic response to amendments Republicans offer to the ObamaCare bill under debate in the Senate:
Currently, Reid and the Democrats are considering their options for moving the debate forward, and actually holding votes. The main possibility being considered is that Reid could move to table irrelevant Republican amendments.
"If we're not allowed to move we're going to have to start tabling amendments," [Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA, 100%)] said.
So whenever the Democrats decide (without consulting the GOP) that a Republican amendment is "irrelevant" -- Marshall's word, but I'm sure he has support on the Hill -- they will simply table it, which means to stuff it in a sack and throw it into the ocean... without debate.
But it's not just Congress, where one expects at least a certain amount of stepping on the minority's toes (though always so many more broken toes when the minority is Republican); the chief executive is supposed to be "President of the United States," not president of the Democratic caucus. But this particular fellow, who ran an entire campaign congratulating himself on his "post-partisanship," has also proven to be allergic to dissent against his meshuge pronunciamentos; John Stossel reports on today's "jobs summit":
"We want to make sure it is not just the public sector doing this in a vacuum," said Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama. "It's important we engage the private sector as well." Administration officials, however, have excluded major trade associations from the summit....
Some of those groups privately complain that their job creation ideas, including enactment of stalled free trade deals that they say would boost exports, are opposed by labor unions, which will be heavily represented at the forum.
The White House, which has clashed with some of the business groups over their opposition to health-care reform and other initiatives, says it has met repeatedly with those organizations and wants to hear fresh ideas.
Yes. I am sure those "fresh ideas" will come from the trade unions whom the White House just hasn't heard from much over the past year. At the summit they will also hear from environmental groups “Green for All” and “Coalition for the Green Bank.” I’m sure they’ll have great ideas for job creation.
Will at least some free-market economists get to speak? No. The White House will hear from Paul Krugman, Joe Stiglitz, and Jeffrey Sachs. "Fresh ideas" won’t be heard from these folks.
Yes, I'm sure all readers of this blog know that a "summit" is generally used to mean a meeting between opposing heads of state to bring a long-term negotiation to a final conclusion. The operative word here is "opposing": If everyone is already singing from the same page, that's not a summit; that's a party.
But this is hardly anomalous in the administration of the Obamacle. When dissenters are so obviously wrong, why bother listening to them? It will only waste time on "irrelevant" proposals. On issue after issue, in task force after task force, he has excluded not only Republicans but even Democrats who are insufficiently subordinate. In fact, his appointment of scores of "Czars" to make decisions in place of secretaries, administrators, and other positions subject to Senate confirmation is a gigantic conspiracy to wall off any congressional dissent to Obamic policy-making.
Democrats in the judiciary evince the very same philosophy of "See no Republicans, hear no Republicans, Allow no Republicans to speak." No better example exists than the liberal judges who have repeatedly overturned the decisions of the people -- often even when those decisions were expressed in democratic elections -- and tried to force same-sex marriage (SSM) on us all, willy-nilly. The astonishing and relentless assault on government of, by, and for the people is particularly brutal in California:
In response to rumblings for SSM from the Left, Californians voted very strongly (61-39) for traditional marriage, Proposition 22, in May of 2000.
Not willing to accept the vote of mere peons -- can't let the inmates run the asylum! -- the California Supreme Court overturned Prop 22 eight years later, May 2008, declaring SSM to be a fundamental right under the California state constitution. Thus shocking those of us who had never actually seen it there before.
This forced the people back to the polls again six months later, where they enacted Proposition 8 by 52 to 48 (in a very Democratic year with Barack Obama on the same ballot). Prop 8 had exactly the same wording as Prop 22, but it was an initiative constitutional amendment, rather than a lowly legislative initiative. Thus, Prop 8 trumped the California Supreme Court's decision by amendmending the constitution.
But the Left refuses to admit defeat. Liberal activists filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to overturn Prop 8 under the federal Constitution, which everybody knows was expressly written in 1787 in order to legalize same-sex marriage.
Notwithstanding all that voting goin' on, a three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals -- all three judges were appointed by Bill Clinton -- has signalled that it is poised to find Prop 8 unconstitutional and throw it out. The voters can go jump in the Pacific.
This will eventually force the issue to the Supreme Court (perhaps after a detour at an "en banc" hearing of the 9th Circus), where I am utterly convinced the current Court will side with the people, not their self-appointed judicial masters.
Regardless of the likely good ending to this long legal saga, my point is that the Democratic response to dissent from its utopian schemes is "shut up and go away." In this case, we actually held a debate in the most public and democratic way: by a democratic election. Now that debate is over and the Right has won, the Left wants the vote overturned by judicial warrant; their own losing side shall be declared the winner, and the votes of millions of Californios become null and void.
This arrogance even permeates the lowest levels of "government," in this case a state-owned, public university.
In the Fall of 1996, the debate over California's Proposition 209 raged. The initiative constitutional amendment threatened to end "affirmative action," that is, race and gender preferences in California -- and the Left was in a lather. How dare those conservatives take seriously all that nonsense about judging folks by the content of their characters, rather than the color of their skins; didn't those religious extremists and social troglodytes understand that skin color completely determines character, as well as determining ability, temperment, and opportunity?
To top off the insult, the campaign for Prop 209 was run by a black conservative, Ward Connerly. How could such a creature even exist, let alone run a successful campaign to change California's constitution?
The wording of the initiative was truly convoluted, contorted, tortuous, and impossible to understand... at least to liberals. It read, "The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public education, or public contracting."
The Left was terrified that the idiot sheeple, in the privacy of the voting booth, might become so befuddled by the sly and tricksy language that they fail to understand that voting for Prop 209 would stop the state from discriminating against, or granting preferential treatment to individuals or groups on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin.
The California State University at Northridge (CSUN) decided to hold a debate on September 25th, 1996. Speaking against the initiative would be famed civil-rights leader Joe Hicks; so obviously, the logical choice to speak in its favor would be Ward Connerly himself.
But the CSUN student council had other ideas... or at least half of them did. It comprised 22 members, as I recall, split evenly between supporters and opponents of Prop 209. When the council called the first question, to invite Hicks to speak in opposition, the vote was unanimous.
But then Student Body President Vladimir Cerna, an outspoken opponent of eliminating "affirmative action" and opponent of Prop 209, pulled a rabbit up his sleeve: Rather than call a vote on the proponent nominated by supporters of the initiative, Ward Connerly, Cerna took it upon himself to introduce a different candidate: He moved that CSUN invite, as its Prop 209 proponent in the debate, David Ernest Duke, former Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan.
Proponents of Prop 209 were aghast; they all voted against the obvious "poison pill." But the lovers of affirmative action unanimously voted for David Duke to represent their opponents, making the vote an 11-11 tie. This allowed Cerna to exercise his power as president to cast a second vote for Duke, and the motion carried 12 to 11. It was official: The pro-Prop 209 side would be represented in the debate by a white nationalist and demonstrated racist.
The Left succeeded in picking a racist monster to "speak for" the Right... but Prop 209 was enacted anyway by a 10-point margin.
I can only conclude, as I have on too many occasions (but don't expect me to exercise admirable restraint in the future), by quoting the late great Robert Anton Wilson, when he ate too many magic mushrooms and channeled Lemuel Gulliver *:
And so... these Learned Men, having Inquir'd into the Case for the Opposition, discover'd that the Opposition had no Case and were Devoid of Merit, which was what they Suspected all along, and they arriv'd at this Happy Conclusion by the most Economical and Nice of all Methods of Enquiry, which was that they did not Invite the Opposition to confuse Matters by Participating in the Discussion.
* Wilson, Robert Anton; "The Persecution and Assassination of the Parapsychologists as Performed by the Inmates of the American Association for the Advancement of Science under the Direction of the Amazing Randi;" p. 85, Right Where You Are Sitting Now, ©1982, And/Or Press, Inc. -- first printing.
Rasmussen reports that the number of Democrats in the United States -- well, let's be specific... the number of folks willing to fess up to being Democrats -- is shrinking; it's now down to 36.0% of the population (rather, of the pool of respondents in the survey).
Back in 2008, Democrats hit a local peak of 41.7% in May; at the election, they were still 41.4%... and we all know how that turned out.
At the same time, Republicans crept up to 33.1%, leaving a shrinking gap of 2.9% (Democrats minus Republicans); that of course is the real statistic to pay attention to. In November 2006, Democrats enjoyed a 6.1% advantage over Republicans; in November 2008, the gap was 7.6%. (These are numbers for "all adults;" Republicans show up and vote at higher percentages than Democrats, so the gap shrinks somewhat during actual elections.)
In November 2004, however, the gap was only 1.6%... yet Republicans only gained 3 net seats in the House and 4 in the Senate. Let's hope that we do better a year from now.
Of course, if the Democrats keep slipping next year as they have this year -- from 40.9% down to 36.0%, while Republicans rose from 32.6% to 33.1%; the gap shrank from 8.3% to 2.9% -- if that trend continues (unlikely, but let's run with it), then by November 2010, Democrats would be down to 30.7%, Republicans would be up to 33.6%, and Republicans would actually enjoy an advantage of 2.9% -- the exact reverse of the gap right now.
In November (monthly tracking, not the daily tracking poll -- and we're back to "likely voters" on this one, not "all adults"), the overall approval rating of President Barack H. Obama was 48%; his overall disapproval rating was a majority, 52%; and his "approval index" -- that is, the number strongly approving minus the number strongly disapproving -- dropped again to -12%, 28% minus 40%. Note especially that while 52% disapprove, fully 40% strongly disapprove; that is, 77% of likely voters who disapprove of the Obamacle do so strongly.
So let's take stock of the Defector General, Arlen Specter (D-PA, 45%), and look forward to the 2010 elections, when Specter next confronts the voters. There are of course three possibilities:
I believe that Pat Toomey, Specter's opponent in the 2004 Republican primary, entrepeneur, restauranteur, president of the Club for Growth, and former U.S. Representative -- who came within 1.7% of unseating Specter in the primary last time -- will be the Republican Senate nominee in 2010. To me, this is much more certain than than Specter will win the Democratic primary (though I think that's likely as well).
So I will simply assume that will be the case until some act of God or analysis by Michael Barone persuades me otherwise. So here are the three possibilities:
In this case, the most likely one, Pennsylvania seemingly would have a clear-cut choice between the conservative-right Toomey and the center-left Specter. But look above at Specter's percentile number... that's not his number from the American Conservative Union (as I would have used yesterday); that 45% is his score from Americans for Democratic Action, the main congressional ranking organization on the Left.
Even assuming that he moves more towards the Democratic side post-switch, Arlen Specter is highly unlikely to be a loyal liberal (he's never been a loyal anything; he's always been a problem child). Remember, he was originally a Democrat but switched in 1965 to run for District Attorney of Pennsylvania, basically for the same reason he switched today: because he couldn't have won the Democratic primary.
Specter is not going to vote party-line for the Left; therefore, he will anger much of the Left, who live by an all-or-nothing credo (just ask Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-CT, 85% D... written out of the Democratic Party despite a much, much more liberal voting record than Arlen Specter's).
Democrats may be stupid about many things but not about politics. They are well aware that Specter's switch has nothing to do with an evolving ideology or "growing in office" and everything to do with crass political calculation, just as it did 44 years ago. Many will resent a moderate Republican, who they have trashed for decades, "stealing" the Democratic nomination, thus preventing a clean shot at conservative Toomey.
I'm sure the Democratic Party will try to lean on and force out any such candidate; but I'm equally sure that at least one Democrat will ignore the central committee and run anyway.
Therefore, whether or not Specter has a divisive primary fight, he is certain to draw a true-blue liberal opponent as a third-party candidate. So instead of Toomey vs. Specter, neat and clean, we're quite likely to have Toomey vs. Specter vs. Mr. Leftie. This may well suck much of Specter's Democratic support away from him... boosting Toomey's chances considerably.
In another boost, Toomey will certainly have access to far more Republican money in 2010 than he did in 2004 or than he would have had running against Specter in the Republican primary. Don't forget, Specter won the nomination last time only because a number of establishment-oriented elected Republicans, including Specter's conservative then-fellow Sen. Rick Santorum and even President George W. Bush, lined up behind him as the best shot at holding the seat (almost certainly true)... and Specter correspondingly sucked up nearly all the big GOP campaign cash.
Some of those same folks will continue to support Defector Specter if they think he's still the favorite to win (the donors who follow the power); but with Specter's reelection in much more doubt this time, they will hedge their bets by supporting Toomey as well. And there are plenty of big-money GOP donors who actually believe in the Republican Party -- shocking, I know -- and they will have no choice but (a) support Toomey or (b) sit on the sidelines and do nothing. An awful lot of money is going to flow into Toomey's coffers.
Finally, there is the delicate question of Specter's age and health. He is both a cancer survivor and also quite old; in 2010, Arlen Specter will be 80.
While some senators have been reelected in their 80s, that is generally when they reign in a one-party state with little opposition; think Strom Thurmond who won reelection in South Carolina at 82, 88, and 94, and Robert Byrd, reelected in West Virginia at 83 and 89. Both these Senate institutions had only token opposition, easily brushed aside, in their later elections.
But Specter's reelection is probably more like that of former Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska. Specter has not been convicted of any felonies, whereas Stevens -- at the time of the election -- stood convicted of seven (all since voided due to prosecutorial misconduct). But Specter has his own comparable problems, including his narrow squeaker against Toomey in 2004. With a strong challenger, Specter's prospects are nowhere near as rosy as Thurmond in 1996 or Byrd in 2006. No matter what, a race between Specter and Toomey will be close -- especially with a liberal third-party candidate.
So under this scenario, I think Toomey has his best chance to be the next Republican senator from the Keystone state.
Judging from Specter's oversized ego -- colossal even by United States Senate standards! -- if he loses the Democratic nomination, there is a very, very good chance he will run anyway as a third-party candidate. If he does, he will suck far more votes from the Left than the Right... though probably not that many.
NOTE: At the moment, according to the Hill newspaper, Pennsylvania election law would not allow him to run as an independent or under a third party if he competed in the Democratic primary and lost:
“It’s pretty hard to run without a party,” Specter said. “It’s always something that could be a possibility. But then I wouldn’t be in the Republican caucus -- wouldn’t have quite the standing as a Republican.”
The decision would be harder for Specter, too, because Pennsylvania state law does not allow someone who has lost a primary to run as an Independent, as Lieberman did. Specter would need to decide to run without a party in advance of the primaries.
However, Pennsylvania voters might soon recognize the registration status of "Independent," and Independent voters might be able to vote in any primary:
Specter lamented that his home state doesn’t allow for him to run as an Independent if he loses the primary. He also said he supports an upcoming effort to open the primaries to independent voters.
So it appears he will not be running as an independent if he loses the primary. (Hat tip to Mr. Michael)
I don't know how who is favored in this case, but probably whichever Democrat runs against Toomey, just because Pennsylvania is a fairly blue state; it went for Obama by 54.65% to 44.23% -- though there will be a much smaller "Obama effect" this time, as Obama is not personally on the ballot. It's not a lost cause, especially if Specter plays dog in the manger with the Democrats.
Even if he doesn't run third party, Toomey is not fated to lose; much depends upon voter sentiment after another year and a half of Obamunism: If the economy has not significantly recovered, if things aren't looking too good on the national security and foreign-policy fronts, if Barack H. Obama and Joe Biden continue making foolish, rookie mistakes and embarassing themselves, then yes, Pat Toomey has a great argument to make that one-party rule is antithetical to Americanism... the very same argument that Democrats made in 2004, by the bye.
I believe this is the least likely of all scenarios by a huge margin -- for the reason of Specter's planet-sized ego, perhaps even eclipsing the overweening ego of William Shatner. (The latter is so supremely confident in his own superiority that he's even willing to satirize himself and his own arrogance -- for example, appearing as the "Big Giant Head" in 3rd Rock From the Sun.)
But if somehow Arlen Specter decided that potential humiliation from losing the race outweighed his desperate desire to cling to power at any cost, if he withdrew from the race and campaigned for the Democrat, then that would give the Democrats their best shot at holding the seat -- the equivalent of what would have happened had Specter remained a Republican, then lost the primary to Toomey. Then we really would have a clean tête-à-tête between the conservative Toomey and the liberal Whoever. In that case, barring a truly serious crisis for the Obama administration, the Democrats hold.
That would be bad, because the new senator would be very liberal, and he would assuredly be the 60th vote to crush Republican fillibusters (or 59th vote, if Sen. Norm Coleman, R-MN, 48%, somehow manages the hat trick of beating Al Franken).
A goodly chunk of Democrats are disgusted enough with Specter as their nominee that they support the spoiler (on the theory that they have such a huge majority anyway, and a chance to pick up more in other states, that they can afford to jettison the former Republican);
That's not a particularly unlikely scenario; and I believe that one gives Pat Toomey a very, very good chance of taking that seat away from the liberal-fascist party of Obama.
Back in the precambrian era -- in fall of 2008, I of course mean -- we warned in several posts that when the federal government takes an "equity interest" (ownership in whole or in significant part) in private companies, it creates a grave threat to the capitalist system:
When government buys a significant stake in private companies, it creates a terrible conflict of interest; decisions that should be made entirely on economic grounds -- attempting to maximize the long-term profit for the owners of the company, whether stockholders or private consortia -- are made instead by politicians pushing a particular political ideology, or else trying to benefit big campaign donors.
Corporate management is ultimately accountable to the owners (though owners can be derelict in their fiduciary duties), while politicians are accountable only to voters and donors, neither of which may have any particular concern about the financial viability of particular private companies in the government's stock portfolio.
The latter especially is a key element of Woodrow Wilson, Benito Mussolini style fascism; it invariably leads to the State, as the $700 billion gorilla on the board of directors, exerting overwhelming control over corporate decisions... which it will exercise on the basis of politics, not profits.
When people read "fascism," they immediately tend to envision concentration camps, jackboots, and Nazis goosestepping at mass rallies; but the real danger of fascism, especially liberal fascism (fascism with a smiley face, as depicted -- against author Jonah Goldberg's wishes -- on the cover of his book Liberal Fascism), is government control of corporations. The more control is handed over to politicians and bureaucrats who have no hand in actually producing the product (loans and securities, in this case), the more critical decisions will be made on irrelevant political considerations, often leading to financial disaster... and another bailout, leading to even more government control. Eventually, the State completely hijacks the corporation for political purposes... and we're well on our way to Hugo Chavez-land.
The threat posed by the government taking an equity interest in private companies can be minimized by making it a matter of law that the holdings are fully divested as soon as buyers can be found at market prices -- either the company buying back its own stock or private third parties taking it off government's hands; in the third Big Lizards post linked up top, "Is It Adios to Capitalism - or Only Au Revoir?", we discussed this possibility:
With the long-expected decision today by President George W. Bush, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, and Fed Chief Ben Bernanke that Treasury will spend $250 billion of the $700 billion buying equity stakes in nine top banks, thus injecting "liquidity" directly into the industry, we stand at a crossroads. The question is whether this is "goodbye" to Capitalism or just "see you soon"... whether this is a permanent break from free markets or just a necessary but temporary bank holiday....
The direct injection of liquidity by Treasury buying equity is also outside the market, because that money is extracted from people by force, in the form of taxes. But at the core, even this direct investment is an attempt to buy time to complete the "transparentizing" (horrible neologism, I know) of the toxic assets -- the recreation of the information that was lost by multiple unregulated securitizations of massive collections of mortgages.
Once the [timely, honest, accurate, and believable information] has been restored to the mortgage-backed securities and other instruments, the market can reboot itself...
With the restoration of the missing THABI information, the market can reboot, and the catastrophe will be averted. So long as partial-nationalization of the banking industry lasts only long enough to retransparentize the toxic assets, thus allowing the market to begin functioning again, it will be an acceptable, even necessary intervention.
Alas, there is nothing in the Obama administration's bailout that implies they will, in fact, consider this a temporary expedient; from everything I've read, they see it as a permanent "reform."
There are two classic anti-capitalist examples of divesting funds for political reasons; together, they point out the very real danger when government becomes a part owner of the private sector through enforced or distressed nationalization (we have seen both in the present crisis):
When universities, big corporations, and of course government programs in the 1970s dumped all their investments in companies based in South Africa or doing business in South Africa, even if they were based elsewhere, to protest Apartheid; this was in response to purely political pressure from black activist groups here in the United States.
And when the usual suspects more recently dumped all investment in Israel, Israeli companies, or companies that did not ritually denounce Israel, in response to purely political pressure from antisemitic, anti-Israel, and generally pro-Palestinian and Islamist activist groups.
Both are examples of government trying to use equity ownership to bully the private sector into purely political actions that have nothing whatsoever to do with the companies in question.
When the government is a significant investor in a company, it cannot help running those companies; government funds never come "string free." Worse, the State runs those companies not to make profits, but to score political points.
In fact, that is exactly what is happening in the case of American International Group (AIG): We have such a huge investment in that company now, $80 billion, that how much they pay employees in retention "bonuses" (inducements to continue working for AIG, rather than jumping ship to some less shaky company) has become a political football.
In fact, the U.S. House of Representatives has just voted overwhelmingly, 328 to 93, to enact a confiscatory tax on AIG employees -- almost by name! -- if AIG fulfills its contractual obligations by paying the employees who stayed on for the work they did (reducing AIG's liability from $2.7 trillion to $1.6 trillion):
Spurred on by a tidal wave of public anger over bonuses paid to executives of the foundering American International Group, the House voted 328 to 93 on Thursday to get back most of the money by levying a 90 percent tax on it....
But there was no doubt after the House vote that the lawmakers were keenly aware of their constituents’ anger, which was focused on A.I.G., although the House measure would apply to executives of any company getting more than $5 billion in federal bailout money.
Hours after the vote, the office of Andrew M. Cuomo, the New York attorney general, said A.I.G. had turned over the names of employees who received bonuses, in response to a subpoena.
Before releasing the list, the attorney general’s office plans to review it and assess whether individuals on it might have reason to fear for their safety.
“We are aware of the security concerns of A.I.G. employees, and we will be sensitive to those issues by doing a risk assessment before releasing any individual’s name,” Mr. Cuomo’s office said in a statement.
So the bill was openly and unabashedly driven by constituent anger -- anger that cannot possibly be based upon a sober and detailed consideration of whether those particular employees deserved those particular bonuses; in fact, the most likely culprit in ginning up such rage and fury is Congress itself, along with the president, who have been demonizing AIG and its employees for months now. It happened again in the debate on this very bill:
“The people have said ‘no,’ ” Representative Earl Pomeroy, Democrat of North Dakota, shouted on the House floor. “In fact, they said ‘hell no, and give us our money back.’ ”
“Have the recipients of these checks no shame at all?” Mr. Pomeroy continued. Summing up his personal view of the so-far anonymous A.I.G. executives, he said: “You are disgraced professional losers. And by the way, give us our money back.”
Great leaping horny toads. I had to wipe spittle-spray off my face after just reading it! "Disgraced professional losers?" Is Earl "Elmer Gantry" Pomeroy (D-ND, 85%) under the impression that these bonuses are going to the actual folks in the credit default swap area, who are the ones who brought AIG down? Or is Pomeroy just blindly striking out against anyone who makes more money than he?
And while we're on the subject, I think there is not a single Democrat in Congress to whom I could not say, “You are disgraced professional losers; and by the way, give us our money back.” And with a damn sight more justification, Earl.
Contrariwise, John Hinderaker -- my favorite blogger on my favorite blogsite, Power Line -- makes a compelling case that the bonuses were in fact perfectly proper:
They were paid, not to the employees responsible for the collapse, but to other employees who have worked hard for months after the collapse to rescue AIG... rather than jumping ship with their expert knowledge of AIG's exact portfolio problems, taking jobs with other companies that had better futures.
As John writes, "[the employees] satisfied the terms of the bonus by wrapping up a portfolio for which they were responsible and/or staying on the job until now. As a result of the efforts of this group, AIG's financial products exposure is down from $2.7 trillion to $1.6 trillion.
They stayed at AIG precisely because of those bonuses; but now the government, having eaten the fruit of that labor as an equity holder, wants those bonuses to go, not to the people who earned it, but to the government itself!
But note how carefully the Times dances around the question of who exactly is getting the bonuses, and what those people's roles were in the collapse:
The $165 million in bonuses has spawned rage in part because it was paid to executives in the very unit of A.I.G. that arguably turned a stable, prosperous insurance company into a dice-rolling financial firm in search of quick profits.
But there must have been hundreds of employees working in the financial products division! Does the Times think that every employee, from vice president down to secretary, was personally responsible for the foolish decisions that nearly killed AIG? Do liberals fantasize even that every executive in that division was responsible?
If new (post-collapse) AIG CEO Edward Liddy is telling the truth, and so far no current or former employee has come forth to contradict him, then the bonuses are going to people who were not responsible for the collapse, but are responsible for helping AIG deal with the collapse after the fact.
Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee and has been among A.I.G.’s fiercest critics, spoke contemptuously of the bonus recipients as people “who had to be bribed not to abandon the company” they had nearly ruined.
Wouldn't that same language, "bribed not to abandon the company," apply to every employee who ever demanded a raise?
It's another example of liberals' inability to deal with complexity; for all their protestations of having more subtle minds, they are really quite simplistic: The poor (and the rich who "represent" them) are always good; the productive core are always bad; and every moral question is the same shade of neutral gray.
John makes the same point as we anent this ridiculous 90% "tax," which is actually a deliberate attempt at confiscation, as the president made clear yesterday in Orange County. John writes:
The legislation introduced by the Democrats today to tax these bonuses (and possibly a few others, although it isn't clear that any others have been or will be paid that are covered by the statute) at a 90 percent rate is an outrage. It is, in my legal opinion, obviously unconstitutional. It is evidently intended to calm the current political firestorm and not to achieve any real objective.
John refers to the legislation as "introduced by the Democrats;" while that's technically true, it's only a half-truth: Democrats may have proposed it, but the House GOP split almost 50-50 on what Hinderaker (a lawyer) and I (a "sea-lawyer") see as an obvious bill of attainder.
In fact, the AP version of the Times article demonstrates Republican cowardice in the House: 87 Republicans voted against the "tax"; but 85 Republicans voted with the Democrats, blaming those retained employees for all of our woes... most switching at the last minute:
Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said the bill was "a political circus" diverting attention from why the administration hadn't done more to block the bonuses before they were paid.
However, although a number of Republicans cast "no" votes against the measure at first, there was a heavy GOP migration to the "yes" side in the closing moments.
This is out and out pandering by the GOP... and it's vile. If we cannot even count on the House Republicans to stand up to liberal demagoguery, to stand up for Capitalism, then what is the point?
It's time for Minority Leader Boehner (R-OH, 100%) to fish or get off the pot: Does he lead a party that is distinct from the liberal Democratic majority, that is center-right, and that still believes in Capitalism, the rule of law, and conservative principles of governance? Has he learned the lessons of 2006 and 2008? Or does Boehner believe that the GOP's best shot at returning to power is to morph into a quieter, gentler version of the Democratic Party, pushing a slightly more restrained version of Obamunism?
"Operation Rushbo" (I think the term belongs to Jonathan Martin at Politico) is the concerted campaign, begun by embedded Clintonistas and now run straight out of the White House, to paint Rush Limbaugh as "the head of the Republican Party,” as White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs put it. It has two goals:
To drive a wedge between conservative and moderate Republicans, as they choose up sides on Limbaugh;
To make Limbaugh the face of the GOP, hoping this will turn off voters (who are supposed to hate the man, according to the Clintonista cabal).
It's the top story everywhere today, it seems. It was the subject of a lengthy article on Politico, articles on AP and other major news feeds, and it has been discussed throughout the blogosphere, including "dextrosphere" phenoms Power Line, Hot Air, Michelle Malkin, and Patterico's Pontifications. (And now on Big Lizards, though we're not as phenomenal as the luminaries above. And we're really not part of the dextrosphere.)
Everybody appears to accept the unexamined conclusion of James Carville, Paul Begala, and Rahm Emanuel that this helps Rush Limbaugh, helps the Democratic Party -- and hurts the GOP. From the Politico piece:
The bigger, the better, agreed [James] Carville. “It’s great for us, great for him, great for the press,” he said of Limbaugh. “The only people he’s not good for are the actual Republicans in Congress.”
But let's take a deep breath and rethink this. Who says Operation Rushbo is good for Democrats and bad for the GOP? I believe it's the other way around: The longer Democrats obsess on radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, the more they will cement their reputation as the unserious party; and the more opportunities will come for Republicans to make up for their shocking, early failure to take advantage of the Democratic miscue. Let me explain via three points.
The president and all the president's men decided it was a great idea to attack a man with one of the world's biggest megaphones, a man with 20 million weekly listeners -- and who is one of the most articulate political debaters in America today... and who has been winning such political fights since before anybody ever even heard of Barack H. Obama (or Carville, Begala, and Emanuel, for that matter). Is this wise?
The more the Democrats focus on Limbaugh, the more exposure he gets; which means the more intelligent arguments against "Obamism" will be aired, the more people (including, increasingly, journalists) will demand that the president and Congress respond, and the more absurd it will seem as the incredibly shrinking president, Mr. "Spread the Wealth Around," debates a talk-show host -- and loses badly, just as he did against Wurzelbacher.
Any controversy that jerks Obama off the magic teleprompter into a real-time exchange is catastrophic for Obama, thus good for the GOP. This is why Limbaugh relishes this argument... and why he just challenged the president to a nationally televised debate (it'll never happen).
There is a famous but probably apocryphal story about Abraham Lincoln. During a trial where he was defending a man accused of biting off another man's ear in a bar room brawl, Lincoln got his chance to cross-examine the chief witness against his client.
"Because I saw him spit it out afterwards," says the witness -- and Lincoln realized immediately that he had asked "one question too many."
Democrats seem most exercised about Limbaugh's statement that he hoped that Barack Obama would "fail" -- which Limbaugh said at a time when the lion's share of the country, even including many who had voted for John S. McCain, wanted Obama to succeed in ending the recession.
The implication was that Limbaugh wanted America to fail, so that Republicans would be elected; but that dog won't fly. That sort of bull in the manger thinking is much more the Democrats' line than ours... remember Rahm Emanuel's comment about "Never allow[ing] a crisis to go to waste?"
If liberals could have let well enough alone, it would certainly have damaged Rush Limbaugh's image, thus the image of Republicans in general. But they cannot help themselves; by blowing this up into a huge national controversy, demanding to know just what Limbaugh meant, they ask one question too many; they let Limbaugh have another crack at making his point.
And of course, it turns out he really does have a good one: All Rush or any elected Republican leader has to say is, "Obama's radical schemes will destroy the America we know and turn us into Sweden or France... and I certainly do hope Obama fails in his radical agenda, so that the great American experiment will win; and our country will return once more to being that shining city on a hill that Ronald Reagan evoked so beautifully."
One of the original intents of Operation Rushbo, according to Hot Air, was to instigate internecine warfare between conservative and moderate Republicans. To the extent that top GOP officials have been running around like chickens with their legs cut off, alternately attacking Limbaugh then groveling to him, it has succeeded. Certainly, RNC Chairman Michael Steele (whom I very much support -- for the moment) did not cover himself with glory by trashing Limbaugh on a cheesy television talk show.
That aspect certainly helps Democrats and hurts Republicans. But the problem is not the operation itself but the stupid Republican reaction to it. The challenge is simply to respond better. Operation Rushbo is a two-edged sword that can be used to slice and dice its creators with a solid response.
The GOP should begin by ignoring it (that is, if nobody brings it up, don't let us do it!) When frustrated journalists directly ask a Republican elected official, he should say, "Rush Limbaugh has a great radio talk show; he practically invented the whole industry. He articulates conservative ideas very well, and we love to hear from Rush and every other host or pundit or sage who has the best interests of the country at heart. But let's get real: The leaders of the Republican Party are the top elected officials plus the Chairman of the Republican National Conference."
And then the GOP responder should look the journalist right in the eye, smile, and ask, "What I think Americans really want to know is, why do Democrats always go after ordinary people, like Rush Limbaugh or Joe 'the Plumber' Wurzelbacher, whenever taxpayers start asking the president and his liberal allies in Congress some tough questions? And why are you guys in the elite media always so anxious to become human shields, throwing yourselves between President Obama and the army of ordinary Joes and Rushes, who don't like the frankly Socialist schemes coming out of the White House? Why are you guys carrying water for James Carville and Rahm Emanuel?"
So if we're stupid and respond stupidly, then Operation Rushbo will be a success, and the Republican brand will be damaged. But if we're even halfway intelligent and respond accordingly (as half-wits, not lack-wits), it will be the Democrats who end up stammering like Robert Gibbs on a bad-tongue day -- and Republicans will gain significantly against the majority party.
A strategy that depends upon the enemy being utter fools is a foolish strategy. Once again, the Clintonista cabal has outsmarted itself; and it has also outsmarted Obama, Squeaker Pelosi, and Majority Leaner Reid in the process. But it's still up to Republican leaders -- I don't mean Rush Limbaugh -- to take advantage of the opening.
We've all been wondering -- oh, all right... I've been wondering -- whence came all those gazillions of Democratic voters who propelled the over-the-top Barack H. Obama over the top. Well, it appears that a new survey by the Josephson Institute of Ethics may have found part of the answer:
Teenagers lie. They cheat and steal, too. And they are doing it more often and more easily than ever.
That is the conclusion of the latest “Report Card on the Ethics of American Youth”, released this week by the Josephson Institute of Ethics, a partnership of educational and youth organizations. The institute conducted a random survey of 29,760 high school students earlier this year (as they have every two years since 1992) and found that the next generation of leaders have a somewhat casual relationship with the truth.
30% of teenagers (35% of boys, 26% of girls) claim to have stolen something from a store in the past year.
42% (49% M, 36% F) said "they sometimes lie to save money;" I'm envisioning 14 year olds crouching down in front of the Mann theaters ticket office, and in a squeaky voice, insisting they're only 12. But in addition, 83% told their parents a lie about "something significant;" again I'm guessing, but I'd say about smoking, drinking, toking, or, er, going a little too far with their boyfriends or girlfriends.
64% -- nearly two-thirds! -- cheated on a test; 36% let their mice do the writing, turning in papers they downloaded off the internet. (Perhaps these are the future Joe Biden voters?)
And to make things worse (and even more confusing), a quarter of respondents confessed that they lied about "one or two" of the questions on this very survey! Of course, that begs the question: lied which way, to make themselves sound more honest and trustworthy, or more wicked cool?
What this survey, which shows a growing trend of falsity, cheating, and amorality, tells us is that we are not only raising yet another generation of kids without a functioning moral compass, but more threateningly, a generation of kids who haven't the slightest idea that there is a real world out there where lying, cheating, and stealing not only won't get you anywhere, it can destroy your life.
I wonder how this recklessness with the truth -- heck, recklessness even with the things they make up -- affects their romantic relationships, their friendships, their own self respect? How can a person honestly, deep down, respect himself if he knows he's a lying sack of offal?
Of course such truth-challenged, reality-denying kids would be much more likely to grow into Democrat-voting young adults; the Democratic Party is the party of fantasy, denial, and situational ethics. Naturally, not every Democrat is dishonest... but the contemporary Democratic Party rewards brazen dishonesty in a way that I don't believe any previous political party in the United States has done.
I firmly believe this is the result of leftist government schools (followed, after a while, by secular private and even religious schools) ceasing to teach ethics, civics, or even basic right and wrong, for fear of trampling on some kid's "right" to choose his own "values." (For that matter, even the substitution of "values," a content-neutral term, for "virtues," which implies a fixed moral code, is a terrible symptom of the disease of nihilism.)
My worthy co-conspirator in a number of projects, Brad Linaweaver, has recently coined a neologism to describe another aspect of this; he refers to members of ELF, ALF, PETA, and other such eco-nut radical activist groups as "econihilists;" I believe he defines the term to mean self-identified ecologists who are so anti-human and pro-nature that they actually ache to see the entire human race destroyed, to make room for the more "moral" species -- spotted owls, blue whales, blue-green algae, Ebola viruses, and the like. I don't think they would put it exactly that way, but that's the gist of their practical philosophy, such as it is.
Both the econihilists and the teens in the Josephson Institute's survey seem to share a deep loathing of the human race... which I can only conclude comes from a deep inner loathing of themselves. Paradoxically, I believe this self-loathing stems from the self-inflicted soul-wound of lying, cheating, and stealing; it is both cause and effect.
By being afraid to tell kids that there is a real right and a real wrong -- that some moral codes are absolute, not subject to the whim of the actor -- we may be sowing the seeds of our species' own destruction.
Perhaps it's time to tell the leftists running the nation's schools to go take a long walk on a short shrift. In my political manifesto, I shall declare that it's time for the GOP, marginally better on absolute morality than the Democrats, to seize the schools back from the dark side... "for the sake of the children." It's one of several strategic goals that the Republicans must pursue with vigor, making the case without compromise, now that we're completely cut out of the legislative and executive power.
In an unusually blunt assessment, the New York Times as much as calls longtime, powerful Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel (NY) a crook:
Representative Charles B. Rangel has helped raise $11 million for a City College of New York school of public service to be named in his honor. In recent months, as questions have emerged about his fund-raising, he has insisted that he has kept his efforts to attract donors scrupulously separate from his official duties in Congress.
But Congressional records and interviews show that Mr. Rangel was instrumental in preserving a lucrative tax loophole that benefited an oil-drilling company last year, while at the same time its chief executive was pledging $1 million to the project, the Charles B. Rangel School of Public Service at C.C.N.Y.
On a nutshell, shortly after the September 11th terrorist attacks, Nabors Industries opened offices in the Caribbean to take advantage of tax shelters to duck paying "tens of millions of dollars annually," projected to be more than a billion over a decade; Rangel bitterly denounced the company in 2002-4 for doing so, even sponsoring (failed) legislation to prevent it.
But then in 2007, the CEO of Nabors, Eugene M. Isenberg, pledged a million dollars to help build the "Charles B. Rangel School of Public Service at C.C.N.Y."... and lo and behold, Charles B. Rangel abruptly saw the light; and now, as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Rangel vigorously defends those selfsame tax shelters.
Not to worry, though; both Rangel and Isenberg insist "There was no quid pro quo." In fact, Mr. Rangel goes so far as to say he had no idea about the megabuck donation to the Rangel School until a year after the fact.
What is clear is that Mr. Rangel played a pivotal role in preserving the tax shelter for Nabors and the other companies in 2007. And while the issue was before his committee, Mr. Rangel met with Mr. Isenberg and a lobbyist for Nabors and discussed it, on the same morning that the congressman and Mr. Isenberg met to talk about the chief executive’s potential support for the Rangel center.
In other words, Rangel flatly lied when he "maintained that he did not even know about [Isenberg's $1 million pledge] until this summer, more than a year later."
The essence of this story is not that Nabors Industries made use of a tax shelter; in fact, I'm all for tax shelters -- so long as they're open to any company, not limited to particular congressional "favorite sons." So far as I know, Nabors did nothing wrong or illegal; indeed, in 2004, the Republican 108th Congress gave its nihil obstat to those very shelters, including Nabors'. I have no reason to believe there was anything wrong or fishy about that decision.
No, the core of this story is the convoluted set of interactions between liberal idealism, ideology, and demagoguery, where raw political pragmatism always seems to triumph; administrations may go and come, but the Left abides -- whether under Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, or Barack Obama.
In 2006, the chattering classes were all agog about "the Republican culture of corruption;" the cry likely played a great role in the terrible loss by the GOP that year, when both the House and Senate tumbled from the right to the left hand.
As the Minority Leader of the House became Squeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Haight-Ashbury, 93%), she kept up a bombardment of furious denunciation of the "corrupt" GOP, lumping together everything from votes that favored business in general to successful fundraising to Mark Foley's clumsy passes at former congressional aides (who were adults).
Indeed, poll after poll showed that the attacks worked, with a majority of Americans believing the GOP was uniquely corrupt, or at least far more corrupt than their counterparts on the left. After winning the congressional elections of 2006, Pelosi was still on that hobby horse:
"The American people voted to restore integrity and honesty in Washington, D.C., and the Democrats intend to lead the most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history," Pelosi said.
Yet without the slightest sense of irony, she proved adamant in her refusal to lift a finger to rein in the most obvious, if not biggest, example of rampant corruption and abuse: earmarks. She also made no serious effort to purge the Democratic caucus of even the most egregious examples of "cold cash for legislation" (remember Rep. William "Freezer Bill" Jefferson, still a Member of Congress from Louisiana, despite being indicted last year for corruption?)
And the Democratic response to the continuing soap opera of Charles Rangel's ethics problems? He was just unanimously reelect him as chairman of Ways and Means last Thursday. So much for "the most honest, most open and most ethical Congress in history"... and the elite media's only reaction was a collective yawn.
They have no excuse; this story was published on the New York Times website yesterday and is on the front page of the print edition today; it is now part of "all the news we see fit to print," and it should be part of our national political dialog. So as a famous failed presidential candidate said more than a decade ago, "where's the outrage?"
Is the Washington Post going to pick up the story? They certainly haven't yet. Neither has any other major news outlet (unless one counts UPI as "major"). Nothing on the networks, not a word on CNN, MSNBC is silent; even Fox News seems to have missed the story -- which is not surprising, alas. We'll keep an eye on them to see if their consciences belatedly bait them into acknowledging this latest nigh-Jeffersonian (William, not Thomas) level of corruption by Mr. Rangel, but I doubt they will.
One would think that the elites would be a bit less reticent, given the powerful cover offered by the king of elite liberalism, the Times, which back on September 14th went so far as to call for Rangel to resign his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Evidently, however, "corruption" is defined as something that the Right does to the Left... just as liberals consistently define "racism" as something that whites do to blacks. By definition, it's not bribery if a Democrat -- especially a black Democrat -- accepts money in exchange for reversing his policy... but it's the rankest form of corruption if a Republican pursues policies, like tax cuts or the war in Iraq, that are supported by the folks who support him. (Republicans must continually prove their honesty by only supporting policies antithetical to everything their core constituencies want... which too many of them are all too eager to do.)
And equally evident is that the drive-by media are very comfortable letting the Democrats walk off with the cash register under one arm. No surprise there, either.
I don't believe anybody has yet noted that President-Erect Barack H. Obama, by choosing (as it now seems clear) Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano as his Secretary of Homeland Security (!) and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson as his Secretary of Commerce, has opened the door a crack for Republicans in those states.
Both governors are very popular... and both states are up for grabs. It's not like selecting Joe Biden as running mate; there was never any danger that Biden's Senate seat would end up being filled by a Republican. But both Arizona and New Mexico are battleground states, up for grabs in the 2012 presidential election.
Arizona voted for John S. McCain in the election, of course; but that's hardly surprising, with a favorite son running. However, it was a disturbingly close: 52.5% for McCain to 45.1% for Obama, a margin of 7.4%. New Mexico was a bigger win for the Democrats than Arizona was for the Republicans: Obama took it by 56.9% to McCain's 41.8%, a 15.1% Democratic victory. I believe in both states, a popular Democratic governor wooed a significant portion of the voters to the left (and of course, in both states, a very large percentage of the voters are Hispanic, and Hispanics lined up behind Obama this year).
In the previous election, New Mexico went to the GOP by the slim and unconvincing margin of 49.9% for George W. Bush to 49.0% for John Kerry, a difference of less than one percent; while Arizona went to the GOP by double digits, 54.9% Bush to 44.4% Kerry (Bush +10.5) -- considerably more robust than it went for Arizonan John McCain this election. Had McCain been from somewhere else, I suspect Arizona would have teetered on the knife-edge and might well have fallen to the Democrat.
Clearly, Obama thought that selecting the two governors for his cabinet would advantage the Democrats: Both Richardson and Napolitano are term-limited out in 2010; they would have to leave anyway. But their successors will get to run for reelection in 2010 as incumbents, instead of duking it out for an open seat.
In New Mexico, the successor to Bill Richardson is a Democrat, Lt. Gov. Diane Denish; but in Arizona, the successor to Janet Napolitano is Secretary of State Jan Brewer -- a Republican (Arizona has no lieutenant governor, so the secretary of state succeeds the governor upon the latter's resignation). Thus, Napolitano's selection immediately puts a Republican in the Arizona statehouse and sets her up as an incumbent to win in 2010.
But what about Denish in New Mexico? It's clear that she is given a boost by getting to run as the incumbent; but even so, I cannot see her as anywhere near as strong a candidate as Richardson was in his two elections. Though Obama has done what he could to help out in that race, the GOP has more of a chance there than they did in either 2002 or 2006.
It may seem a small thing, having a chance to convert two Democratic governorships to Republican hands. But it's of such "little things" that big results can flow. If Brewer can hold Arizona, and if a Republican can defeat Diane Denish in New Mexico, then it's somewhat more likely that in the presidential election of 2012, the GOP can once again hold Arizona's ten electoral votes (which had seemed dangerously close to flipping) and might even return New Mexico's five back into red territory.
Without the "rage against the red" that characterized 2006 and 2008, its unlikely that former red states such as Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio, and Nevada will remain blue; while even states that have been drifting a bit leftwards (such as Virginia and Colorado) will be more winnable by the Republican nominee... particularly if the nominee is someone exciting, like Sarah Palin or Bobby Jindal, running against a Barack Obama who has lost his aura of newness, change, and hope in the crush of day to day governing.
Commenter Baggi suggests that the Colin Powell endorsement wouldn't be Barack H. Obama's big "October surprise" against John S. McCain, because it comes too early in the month. The true October surprise ideally materializes the last week before the election -- as when George W. Bush's DUI arrest was released a week before the 2000 election, or when Iran-Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh announced the indictment of former Bush-41 Secretary of Defense Cap Weinberger four days before the 1992 election.
(And why is it that it's always Democrats who launch such surprises against Republicans, never the other way round? Of course, the essence of an October surprise is to catch the other guy falling short of his principles; so how can Democrats fall short of what they haven't got in the first place?)
Thus, Obama may still put one more shoe on the other hand. Here are some lizardian suggestions of what that bootless shoe might comprise:
During the several years when Sen. McCain resided abroad in Vietnam, he and his dorm-mates pooled all their resources and shared them equally. Can you say "spread the wealth around" -- Comrade McCain?
In 1946, in a 6th grade English assignment -- long after World War II had ended -- John McCain used a hurtful racist slur against our then-allies. He wrote, "When I grow up I want to be a solder because I will get to drive a tank and a jap and a airplan and kill Natzes." Apparently, McCain's violent, racist fantasies began a long time before his current campaign.
In stunning news, Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin turns out not to be eligible for that high office because she is not a "natural born citizen;" although her parents were both American citizens, she herself was born in Alaska, way up north past Canada -- not in the continental United States of America at all. Can we trust a foreigner in the highest office of the land?
Two years ago, John McCain proposed a risky scheme to give illegal aliens a "path to citizenship." But recent research has revealed one element of that plan that McCain never disclosed to the American people: Once those illegal immigrants were U.S. citizens, under the McCain plan, they would be eligible for drivers licenses. Illegal immigrants and drivers licenses -- now which pot is calling the kettle African American?
An independent congressional watchdog whistleblowing reform taxpayer's association has stumbled upon shocking evidence that "Senator Clean," John McCain, has allowed taxpayer money to be diverted into his own pocket for half a century. This diversion of funds went unchecked even after he was elected to the Senate. Do we need four more long years of the Republican culture of corruption?
By now, most of us have suffered through the embarassing video of Alaskan hussy Sarah Palin, wearing little more than lipstick, parading around on stage in front of hundreds of people. But a few years before that, she went much, much farther: We have obtained photographs she allowed to have taken where she is completely nude and giggling with glee, lolling on a rug made from the skin of a bear, which her father may well have personally slaughtered. Can America afford such a wanton roundheel just a heartbeat away from the presidency?
John McCain demands "honesty" in government economic policy. But independent researchers have discovered that he has funneled large sums of money to so-called "charities" and concealed those payments by not reporting them on his tax returns. Thousands to questionable special interests with no disclosure whatsoever. Falsifying tax forms is a federal felony. Would you cast your precious vote for a felon?
In 1967, the USS Forrestal suffered one of the most devastating fires ever on an American naval vessel. Many know that John McCain was a young officer on that aircraft carrier; but they may not be aware that a Navy investigation subsequently found a direct connection between McCain's actions and that horrific fire, as he voluntarily taxied his A-4 to the exact spot that a supposedly "errant" missile was going to strike. When his plane was hit, rather than stay and fight the fire, McCain ran from his plane, saving himself and allowing 134 brave sailors to die while he lived. America deserves better than a man with such depraved indifference to human life.
Many of those closest to hunter-killer Sarah Palin have noticed a frightening instability in the would-be vice president's emotional health. This instability manifests nearly every month; its symptoms include the inability to fully control her emotions, sudden anger with little provocation, distracted attention, inexplicable pain, and sudden bleeding from unknown lacerations, possibly self inflicted. Doctors have expressed grave concerns whether Mrs. Palin is medically fit to serve, given her condition. We feel sorry for anyone with such an infirmity -- but America needs a president who is healthy, emotionally stable, and mentally balanced.
Democrats are never more creative than when they're concocting bizarre charges of sex, corruption, or psychiatric disorders to lodge against Republicans... so that they never have to defend their actual policies, which the country by and large despises. I'm sure this post barely scratches the surface of what we'll see in the next fortnight.
After the Saddleback fiasco for Barack H. Obama, the first meme floated by Obama surrogates (in particular by Andrea Mitchell) was that the only way John S. McCain could have sounded so prepared, so confident, and so well informed was that -- he must have cheated.
He was outside the "cone of silence;" he heard the questions beforehand; he had an unfair advantage because Obama had to go first. But that has been pretty definitively debunked; guest blogger DRJ, for one, at Patterico's Pontifications has a timeline that pretty much rules out that possibility.
So now the desperate Democrats have floated a new meme: McCain's "cross in the dirt" story is "hauntingly like" a story told by Alexander Solzhenitsyn. McCain stole it! It never happened! Sure, John McCain may have done better answering the questions... but all that is negated because he's a serial plagiarist. After all -- didn't he also steal Jackson Brown's "Running on Empty," and didn't he insert a few words from a Wikipedia entry into some speech?
(Of course, if Barack Obama selects Joe Biden as his running mate, the accusation of plagiarism might be quietly dropped.)
In the first place, when did this Solzhenitsyn story appear? It dates from a 1997 article, but it is not even a direct quotation from Solzhenitsyn; instead, it's a retelling by Fr. Luke Veronis, "an American priest serving in Albania," of a moment when Solzhenitsyn had hit a nadir during his long incarceration and had given up all hope:
Laying his shovel on the ground, he slowly walked to a crude work-site bench and sat down. He knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up, and when he failed to respond, the guard would beat him to death, probably with his own shovel. He had seen it happen to many other prisoners.
As he waited, head down, he felt a presence. Slowly, he lifted his eyes and saw a skinny, old prisoner squat down next to him. The man said nothing. Instead, he drew a stick through the ground at Solzhenitsyn’s feet, tracing the sign of the Cross. The man then got back up and returned to his work.
As Solzhenitsyn stared at the sign of the Cross, his entire perspective changed. He knew that he was only one man against the all-powerful Soviet empire. Yet in that moment, he knew that there was something greater than the evil that he saw in the prison, something greater than the Soviet Union. He knew that the hope of all mankind was represented in that simple Cross. And through the power of the Cross, anything was possible.
Note the most significant difference: In the Solzhenitsyn story, it's not a guard but rather another prisoner who makes the sign of the cross. If McCain stole the story, why would he change the actor from prisoner to guard? After all, if he's trying to show the fortitude they all displayed, it makes more sense if the prisoners themselves keep each other alive and hopeful, as in his other story about his fellow prisoner who sewed a small American flag out of scraps of cloth.
Second, much is made (e.g., by Andrew Sullivan) that in McCain's first full account of his captivity, written in 1973, he doesn't mention this story. But of course, one could equally well note that in Solzhenitsyn's first full accounting of his story, the Gulag Archipelago, also first published in 1973 (in French; the first English version dates from 1974, I believe), he evidently neglects to tell his own "cross in the dirt" story as well. Lot of that going around.
The story does not come from the Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn's seminal work about his many years in the Soviet political prison system. If someone can find this story there, please let me know, and I will correct this post. I don't think the book is available online in a searchable format (it's probably still in copyright), and I have no intention of thumbing through each page of both volumes of the book to find a single short anecdote. But nobody so far has claimed that the account appears in that work... just in the Veronis article.
Various liberal commentators insist that McCain first told his own story in 1999, two years after the Veronis article. But what they mean is that 1999 was when he first used it publicly as part of a campaign stump speech. But we have a very different claim by one of McCain's fellow POWs, Orson Swindle, held in the Hanoi Hilton at the same time, sometimes in the same cell with McCain:
"I recall John telling that story when we first got together in 1971, when were talking about every conceivable thing that had ever happened to us when we were in prison" Swindle told me a few minutes ago. "Most of us had been kept apart or in small groups. Then, in 1970, they moved us into the big cell. And when we all got to see each other and talk to each other directly, instead of tapping through walls, we had 24 hours a day, seven days a week to talk to each other, and we shared stories. I vaguely recall that story being told, among other stories." [1971 would be 26 years before the Fr. Veronis story first appeared, and even three years before the Gulag Archipelago itself was published in English, just in case the new claim is that the story appears there. I find it unlikely that McCain would have obtained a review copy while in the Hanoi Hilton.]
"I remember it from prison," Swindle continued. "There were several stories similar to that in which guards -- a very few, I might add -- showed compassion to the prisoners. It was rare, and I never met one, but some of the guys did."
So now, for the Democrats to maintain this meme -- vital to proving that Obama really won the Saddleback non-debate, no matter what ignorant, uninformed voters may have thought -- they must pursue one of the following options:
Orson Swindle, who is campaigning for McCain, is a big, fat liar. McCain never told him any such story. Swindle, like his name, is just lying to save McCain from the consequences of the senator's own serial prevarications, lies, slanders, and vicious Swift-Boating of the One, "the leader that God has blessed us with at this time," as Squeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Haight-Ashbury, 93%) said last Sunday.
Swindle is simply addled and confused, probably dating to the days of his nightmarish confinement. He's just like Ronald Reagan, whom we now know began suffering the symptoms of his unusually slow-progressing Alzheimer's disease around 1947, when he became president of the Screen Actors Guild and developed an incomprehensible loathing of Communists. Swindle is senile and befuddled and, well, he's just a bundle of nerves. He can't help it... he probably really does hallucinate that McCain told him that story in 1971. But of course, we know that's impossible -- because Solzhenitsyn himself didn't recount the original until 1997. [The wheels on the bus go round and round...]
All right, so maybe Swindle is right and McCain really did tell it to him and other prisoners in 1971. But all that proves is that McCain was a serial fabricator even back then. Look at all the other lies that he has told through the years: That the surge is a success, that an embryo is a person from the moment of conception, that we should lower taxes... the man is obviously a pathological liar, and you don't become one of those overnight. Therefore, the evidence is overwhelming that McCain was simply lying about that, air quotes, "cross in the dirt" story as long as 37 years ago. How can even Republicans possibly elect such a corrupt, Bible-thumping Nazi to the presidency?
Paul Mirengoff over at my favorite blog has published a thought-provoking post that I urge you to read. He labors a bit for the punchline, creating occasion to refer to both Bill Clinton and Barack H. Obama as sorcerers' apprentices; but the label is worth the labor, and he defends it well:
This ability to transform things so fundamentally (like into unlike; unlike into like) resembles magic, and to a certain kind of personality, it can be intoxicating. Among these types, one imagines, is the future politician. The risk of such intoxication is heightened by the fact that the post-modernism I described above has seeped into legal education, which means that too many law professors behave less like the restrained “sorcerer” and more like the sorcerer’s apprentice. Clinton and Obama both were law professors when they were young.
The only nit I intend to pick is that the contemporary image of the sorcerer's apprentice is forever tainted by the wonderful Walt Disney film Fantasia, where the S.A. is "played" by Mickey Mouse. Since Mr. Mouse is always sympathetic, a certain benign tolerance bleeds into what should be the portrait of an arrogant apprentice monkeying with spells he is not fit to cast, thus endangering himself, his master, and indeed the entire village. In Fantasia, to the charming tune of Paul Dukas, the criminally negligent apprentice becomes a cuddly scapegrace, a lovable rascal.
I don't see either Bill Clinton or Barack Obama as mere scallywag; each is darker, more cold-bloodedly narcissistic, more beholden to the evil of his master. Here is where I think Paul took his wrong turn:
The second factor is the boundless (and largely justified) self-confidence Clinton and Obama possess. Both are entirely self-made. Both came from the periphery of society and, seemingly without much effort, grabbed its most glittering prizes. For both, glibness was a key to the success itself and to the appearance of its ease. No wonder both believe they can magically talk their way out of contradictions.
In fact, neither is "self-made," in the sense of a person who succeeds by his own initiative and intellect. Each pol, Clinton and Obama, hooked up, early in his career, with a mentor, guru, kingmaker who propelled him to the upper echelon of political society before he was seasoned. Clinton was the protege of Sen. William Fulbright; Obama became the eager acolyte of the vile Jeremiah Wright. Interestingly, both mentors were well-known racists and demagogues even at the time their proteges sought the relationship, seemingly without qualm in both cases.
The evil of these gurus precludes thinking of either follower as good old Mickey. To stick with Paul's metaphor of the sorcerer's apprentice, Bill Clinton -- until he seized his own power -- played Grima Wormtongue to Fulbright's Saruman; while Barack Obama spent twenty years as the Mouth of Sauron.
Both wings of the Democratic Party (the political wing and the elite media) have piled onto poor, old Charlie Black, a senior advisor to John S. McCain, for a comment of his. Yet nobody has the faintest idea how the exchange actually ensued, or whether Black was an idiot or was set up (after the fact).
Even so, and not surprisingly, a passel of crowing, self-righteous Republicans has loudly joined the scrum, eager to do as much damage to their own candidate as possible... a sadly typical manifestation of the Republican tendency towards self-immolation that we've seen in every election from 1988 onward. It seems we must always fight on two political fronts: against the Democratic nominee and against all Republicans who supported a different candidate to be the GOP nominee.
For the record, here is the entire "terrorist attack" exchange from Fortune Magazine that has caused all the ruckus. McCain is asked what will be America's biggest economic challenge during the next president's administration, and he answers, "Well, I would think that the absolute gravest threat is the struggle that we're in against radical Islamic extremism, which can affect, if they prevail, our very existence. Another successful attack on the United States of America could have devastating consequences."
Not a bad answer; the attack on September 11th, 2001, was apocalyptic not only due to the loss of more than 3,000 innocent lives (counting those who died in the moment and those who died later), but even more via the crushing blow to the American economy it precipitated, which affected everyone, rich and poor alike. McCain answered Fortune's question exactly, despite the rather adolescent response of Editor at Large David Whitford:
Not America's dependence on foreign oil? Not climate change? Not the crushing cost of health care? Eventually McCain gets around to mentioning all three of those. But he starts by deftly turning the economy into a national security issue - and why not? On national security McCain wins. We saw how that might play out early in the campaign, when one good scare, one timely reminder of the chaos lurking in the world, probably saved McCain in New Hampshire, a state he had to win to save his candidacy - this according to McCain's chief strategist, Charlie Black. The assassination of Benazir Bhutto in December was an "unfortunate event," says Black. "But his knowledge and ability to talk about it reemphasized that this is the guy who's ready to be Commander-in-Chief. And it helped us." As would, Black concedes with startling candor after we raise the issue, another terrorist attack on U.S. soil. "Certainly it would be a big advantage to him," says Black.
Following which, the article simply moves on, making no further reference to Black's response; evidently, the supposely staggering nature of this allegedly shocking admission entirely escaped the notice of Mr. Whitford at the time.
As Fortune admits, it was they, not Black, who "raised the issue" of who would benefit from a terrorist attack on the American heartland. Black merely responded to the question.
And to what question, exactly, was Black responding? Fortune doesn't tell us, and there is evidently no transcript or video available. Perhaps it was super explicit: Mr. Black... if there were another 9/11, would that benefit Barack Obama or John McCain most? Yet on the basis of that single, flimsy piece of evidence, Republicans are willing (eager) to ascribe the basest and vilest motives to Black.
One prominent conservative blogger (much prominenter than we) goes so far as to sarcastically ask whether Black thinks that it would be even more advantageous if a terrorist attack slew Obama himself and all other Democratic candidates in some blue state... a smear I consider low enough to have been published by a Markos Moulitsas or a Juan Cole.
But what is so outré about his answer? If Whitford asked Obama's campaign mangler whether a sudden downturn in the economy would be good for his client, and if he answered honestly that it probably would, would anyone -- even Republicans -- be up in arms? Or would they simply agree?
For some reason, when a disaster or catastrophe occurs, Republicans (but not Democrats) grow suddenly reticent about noticing that it might have a political impact among all the other real-world effects it causes. Desite our evident foot-scuffing, red-faced embarassment at noticing such trivia in the midst of crisis, politics is an integral part of our lives... and the shifting sands of electoral fortune usually determine whether we respond to adversity with courage and vigor -- or whether we turn tail and run from the fight.
Take Hurricane Katrina. Even before it made landfall (at a greatly reduced category 3), Democrats were already on the air slamming Bush for his "non-response" (which was actually one of the fastest and most effective disaster responses in history, as we noted more than two years ago). Yet rather than fight back against the Democratic smear machine, Republicans lined up by the score to castigate, ream, and verbally defenstrate the president for his "pathetic," "incompetent" preformance. They cheered Democrats on as the latter singled out FEMA director Michael "Brownie" Brown and called him a clownish dullard who allowed hundreds of helpless old people to drown -- by not waving his hands and magically diverting the storm elsewhere.
Republicans have a terrible penchant for joining any hysterical lynch-mob attack on fellow Republicans: Perhaps to prove they're not really the heartless, unfeeling fiends that liberals portray them to be; more often to advance their sectarian civil war with other GOP blocs. But rather than engender respect from the Left for their principled nuance and unbiased fair-mindedness, they call only even more energetic contumely upon their heads.
We have a bad habit of playing dhimmi to the Democrats... and it's so ingrained that many conservatives cannot help themselves, even when they know the scam being run. They eat their own as inevitably as a dead frog leg twitches when you zap it with a few volts of electricity.
As here. There is nothing indefensible about what Black said; he spoke the truth: Another terrorist attack would focus voters' minds on national security, just as another Senate scandal would focus voters' minds on congressional corruption. Either might turn the election.
So let's cut the dramatics and stop pretending that politics doesn't matter, or that it should be "above the fray" of real-world battles and other incidents. Had the counterinsurgency gone ill, doed anyone think Democrats would have hesitated for a nanosecond to use that failure -- which could have led to the deaths of far more than 3,000 Americans -- to ride their way into la Casablanca?
Instead of trying to suck up to the Left by cannibalizing our own troops, why don't we point out the hypocrisy of a party whose motto is "the personal is political," and which has in very recent memory politicized the war, 9/11, various natural disasters, and the funeral of Sen. Paul Wellstone, whining that Charlie black is trying to "politicize" a presidential election.
Of course a terrorist attack would affect the vote. So would an assassination, the capture of bin Laden, an Iranian demonstration of a nuclear bomb, or an economic collapse (which the Democrats are assiduously trying to bring about, in contrast to Republicans, who are doing their best to prevent another 9/11). How could such earth-shattering events fail to influence the vote?
Instead, let's defend the importance of politics and the election. Let us note that Democrats seem more than eager to return to the halcyon days of Jimmy "Malaise" Carter and Walter "We Must Not Arm the Heavens" Mondale. And let's stick up for Charlie Black telling it as it is... something Democrats couldn't do if their reelection depended upon it.
First, we all know the normal "Democratic freakout" scenario that everyone has been talking about for thirty or forty years:
Scenario 1: Hillary continues to lag behind Obama throughout the primary season; but because of the proportional awarding of delegates, she ends up only about 200-300 delegates behind him. Then, in a political back-room deal that is almost Clintonian in its deviousness, she manages to force the convention to seat the Michigan and Florida slates of delegates... and she bribes enough stupordelegates to switch that she just squeaks ahead of Barack Obama by five or six votes.
Hillary becomes the nominee -- by the most sculduggerous means since John Quincy Adams stole the presidency from Andrew Jackson in 1824.
Blah, blah, blah. Under this scenario, we can all guess what would happen: Hillary would offer the downticket slot to Obama, who would refuse (not wanting to tie himself to her losing campaign -- and being unwilling to play second violin to her screechy lead for four years in the unlikely event that she won). Thereafter, the huge majority of blacks would be enraged at the Clintons: For the first time ever, a black man would have been within arm's reach of the Democratic nomination... and then that white [rhymes with snow] comes along and snatches it away from him!
A record number of black voters might sit out the election in a snit, leading to the loss not only of the entire South (which is going red anyway), but also such Democratic states as Michigan, Illinois, New York, and Pennsylvania... each of which has a fairly high percentage of black voters.
But there is another scenario, even more likely, which could be just as delicious -- from a GOP point of view...
Scenario 2: Hillary continues to lag behind Obama throughout the primary season; but because of the proportional awarding of delegates, she ends up only about 200-300 delegates behind him. She tries to pull off a political back-room deal that is almost Clintonian in its deviousness: She manages to force the convention to seat the Michigan and Florida slates of delegates... but then she falls just short of enough superdelegates to squeak past Barack Obama.
Barack Obama becomes the Democratic presidential nominee... but Hillary supporters are screaming foul and accusing Obama of outcheating them.
So what happens under this scenario? How about this: Hispanics historically are suspicious of, and often have a great bias against, blacks; it comes from the social and cultural differences (religion, work habits, geographical orientation -- Southwest vs. deep South and New York); from the naked scorn that many blacks have for "Mexicans;" from the way that the much smaller minority of blacks has managed to seize total control of the entire civil-rights establishment and keeps Hispanics away from the levers of power; and indeed, just because of competition for government dollars.
In particular, Hispanics have pretty much backed Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama. So when she fails to steal the nomination (as she has promised them), Democratic Hispanic voters blame Obama -- and they sit out the election in a snit. Worse, because John McCain is best known for his attempt to regularize illegal aliens (the vast majority of whom are Hispanic), many of these disaffected former Democratic voters vote instead for McCain... and McCain ends up getting a greater share of the Hispanic vote than even George W. Bush did in 2000 (35%) or 2004 (44%).
Maybe McCain gets 50% or 55%... and suddenly states like Washington, Rhode Island, Oregon, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Connecticutt, and even California come into play.
Scenario 3: Hillary Clinton continues to lose, but she loses catastrophically, leading her to drop out of the race early. Hispanics are disappointed, but there is no way to spin this as some sort of slight by Barack Obama. Chalk it up to Democratic voters finally deciding they're happy to see the backs of the Clintons, once and for all!
While (3) is plausible, I don't think it likely; the very structure of the delegate-awarding process argues against it. Thus, we will either have a wonderful opportunity to increase the Republican share of the Hispanic voting population... or else a great chance of reducing the Democratic share of black votes. Either way, we could win big. And either way, somebody's going to sulk and demand a nationwide recount.

Squeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Haight-Ashbury, 95%) said, just a few days ago, that despite the now impossible to deny military success of the "surge" (how I hate that misleading word, whether Democrat or Republican uses it), the entire Iraq war is lost because the Iraqi government hasn't made any political progress.
Then Wednesday, as if on cue, the Iraqi parliament enacted legislation for provincial elections... resolving one of the three central political -- er -- quagmires standing in the way of building a relatively free and relatively democratic Iraqi nation. (The other two are anti-de-Baathification, which was passed some weeks ago; and oil revenue sharing, which is very close to being fully resolved.)
It appears the Iraqi parliament has accomplished more of its own agenda than has Nancy Pelosi since she and her cronies took over Congress thirteen months ago.
The capper came last night, when the Speaker refused even to call a vote on semi-permanizing the FISA reforms that passed by more than two-thirds in the Senate and had a solid majority already declared for passage in the House. It was simply more important to Nan to:
Slime the Bush administration by passing -- on a narrow, party-line vote -- "contempt of Congress" charges against White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten and former White House Chief Counsel Harriet Miers... for not confessing that political appointees were appointed for partially political reasons;
Pay off their biggest special-interest donors, the trial lawyers, who want to get rich feeding off the carcass of the telecom industry, which had the misfortune to agree to help the government track down terrorists in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. Indeed, no good deed goes unpunished -- by Democrat-supporting trial lawyers. (By the way... once the lawyers sue Big Telephone out of existence, who will offer the conference-call service litigators live for?)
Looks like Senate Majority Leader Harry "Pinky" Reid (D-Caesar's Palace, 90%) may have to share his booby prize with his sister across the Rotunda.
The gasps of shock and screams of outrage must have been audible from the pot parlors of Berkeley, to the brahmin bashes on Beacon Hill, to the tea and cucumber sandwich fundraisers in Chappaqua: John Murtha has "gone native!"
And indeed, Rep. John Murtha (D-PA, 65%) -- the poster boy for "immediately" ending the war and redeploying all of our troops to next-door Okinawa, whence they could respond to any sudden terror threat in a scant four or five weeks -- went to Iraq, came back, and made some remarks yesterday about the counterinsurgency (COIN) strategy that can only be described as a laudatory about-face:
The Pennsylvania Democrat gave qualified but likely his most glowing remarks Thursday about the Iraq war.
"I think the surge is working, but that's only one element," said Murtha, who chairs the defense appropriations subcommittee. "And the surge is working for a couple of different reasons. And one reason is the increase in troops."
Murtha hastened to assure everyone yesterday he was still for yanking the troops out instanter, and he quickly moved today to claim that the drop in violence in Iraq was another black eye for the Bush administration; still, however, he now finds himself in the growing club of anti-war Democrats who have been forced by circumstance -- or would that be "mugged by reality?" -- into admitting the surge of success by the COIN strategy led by Gen. David Petraeus (Commander Multinational Force - Iraq) and presided over by President George W. Bush.
This singular admission by more and more Democrats may well be responsible for the second leg of our political journey: Now that we are clearly winning, Democrats are simply losing interest in Iraq. They've abruptly grown bored with the Iraq war as an election issue. Now they want to talk about socialist economics, the evils of Bush, and -- ominously enough, from the Democratic perspective -- they want to talk a lot more about illegal immigration:
Congressional Democrats are reporting a striking change in districts across the country: Voters are shifting their attention away from the Iraq war.
Rep. Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat from Tennessee, said not a single constituent has asked about the war during his nearly two-week long Thanksgiving recess. Rep. Michael E. Capuano, an anti-war Democrat from Massachusetts, said only three of 64 callers on a town hall teleconference asked about Iraq, a reflection that the war may be losing power as a hot-button issue in his strongly Democratic district.
First-term Rep. Nancy Boyda (D-Kan.) -- echoing a view shared by many of her colleagues -- said illegal immigration and economic unease have trumped the Iraq war as the top-ranking concerns of her constituents.
In an interview with Politico, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) attributed the change to a recent reduction of violence and media coverage of the conflict, saying there is scant evidence that more fundamental problems with the Bush administration’s policy are improving. Even so, he agreed voters are certainly talking less about the war. “People are not as engaged daily with the reality of Iraq,” Hoyer said.
The change in mood perceived by Democratic lawmakers comes as one of Congress’ most vocal war critics, Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), returned from a trip to Iraq and told reporters Thursday that “the surge is working” to improve security, even though the central government in Baghdad remains “dysfunctional.”
So we're back to Murtha. But he didn't just stop after saying "the surge" was working; he went on to find so many different ways to contradict himself, it beggars the imagination. From the Fox News story:
Murtha, speaking to reporters Thursday in his hometown of Johnstown, Pa., mixed in renewed criticism of the Bush administration's management of the Iraq war, saying it was waged with too few troops, and that it is too costly.
"We can no longer afford to spend $14 billion a month on this war and let our readiness slip," Murtha said.
"But the thing is, the Iraqis have to do this themselves," he added. "We can't win it for them in Afghanistan or Iraq, and provinces they've (Iraqi forces) taken over, we've done better. We can't win."
So what is actually causing the sudden deflation of Iraq as an election issue, particularly among Democrats? I think it's pretty clear: Not just Democratic office holders but Americans in general are beginning to accept the reality that we're now winning the Iraq war:
For the first time in a long time, nearly half of Americans express positive opinions about the situation in Iraq. A growing number says the U.S. war effort is going well, while greater percentages also believe the United States is making progress in reducing the number of Iraqi casualties, defeating the insurgents and preventing a civil war in Iraq.
Roughly half of the public (48%) believes the U.S. military effort in Iraq is going very or fairly well. Judgments about the overall situation in Iraq have been improving steadily since the summer. As recently as June, only about a third of Americans (34%) said things were going well in Iraq.
Finally, back in January, 42% of respondents said that Iraq was the worst problem facing America today, making it number one; it's still number one... but now, only 32% say it's the worst problem.
And there's your genesis for the loss of interest in the war as a political issue in the upcoming election.
Democrats are still frantically trying to spin away the rising tide of belief that we're winning; they note that the same Pew poll that shows a rise in those who think we're winning has not yet shown any drop in the number of Americans who want the troops to come home. But there is no reason to expect different aspects of public opinion to move in lockstep; even within public-opinion polling, itself a lagging indicator, we have less-lagging and more-lagging elements.
Logically, public opinion on how we're doing must change first; then opinion on what we should do next will change in response somewhat later. Finally, I believe the last thing to change, the "most lagging" of the lagging indicators, would be the public decision on whether the war was worth it.
But I cannot think of a single instance in which a public perception of American victory was not followed by increased willingness to stay and fight -- and also by a retroactive decision that yes, the fight was indeed worth it all: Time mutes all pain.
(Vietnam is not a counterexample, because despite our resounding victory there under Gen. Creighton Abrams, the American public was tricked by leftists such as Walter Cronkite into believing we were losing, when in fact we were winning. There never was a public perception of American victory and still is not today -- though that is finally starting to change, with the advent of talk radio, which drives publishers to publish serious conservative tomes; and by the arrival of "new media," which allows Americans to discuss the new information coming out about Vietnam.)
If the election becomes focused on economics, that is a much easier argument for Republicans to win; they can contrast their own budgetary proposals to the wild taxing and spending that Democrats have already promised. If it becomes focused on illegal immigration, then I don't know if anybody has an advantage -- if anything, slight advantage to Democrats; but that's a far cry from the huge advantage on the Iraq war that Democrats enjoyed in the 2006 election. And of course, there will be a lot less focus on the "Republican culture of corruption," with the Democrats' predictable failure to do anything substantive about the very abuses they screamed about last year... notably earmarks. (And no Mark Foley problem!)
So we're moving in the right direction. I fully expect that by the time the election rolls around, the number of Americans demanding we pull out will have fallen drastically (it's about 50% right now)... and those saying the Iraq invasion was worth it will be well over the 50% line.
At that moment, the Democrats may bitterly regret their long and frantic campaign to cram defeat in Iraq down America's throat. Running against America has rarely been a winning electoral strategy; I believe the Democrats are about to re-experience that painful lesson.

Scarcely a day goes by without some top headline reference to some major ecological challenge. But so many of these issues, perhaps most of them, transcend traditional national territories even as these actors are the ones that are tasked with tackling such crises.
Indeed, the focus of most attention these days is upon the boundaries of the entire earth system, in particular the nine thresholds that Johan Rockstrom and colleagues at the Stockholm Resilience Centre first identified in 2009 as key to humanity living within a safe operating space in the planetary biosphere, including climate change, biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, ozone depletion and chemical pollution.
Climate change in particular makes it clear that environmental matters cross many boundaries in ways that make governing change using territorial borders very difficult.
In the last few years, we have seen the transformation of landscapes into their conception as carbon sinks, as well as the financial calculations of offsets and carbon trading and related climate strategies.
A key interest for researchers in this area is which environmental phenomena are governed by territorial strategies with definable borders, and which ones aren’t, and what forms do new structures of international environmental governance take.
Border arrangements have long been important for managing common issues such as rivers and waterways that have defined geographical features. But what they are managed for, and specifically what is it that is being sustained when it comes to fishing, navigation, water supply, electricity generation or recreational boating?
Clearly trade measures controlling cross border flows matter in such things as wildlife protection and stratospheric ozone, but at least so far not so much in terms of climate change.
Meanwhile, attempts to link Yukon to Yellowstone in a wildlife migration corridor emphasize the difficulties of borders in environmental management. Migratory species and agreements on managing birds in particular complicate the matter. And what cross-border strategies are appropriate for invasive species?
All of these sort of issues also raise key questions about the shifting territorial modes of rule in the face of rapidly changing technologies.
Can we tease out general principles where certain kinds of phenomena are amenable to management by bordering? How do atmospheric, terrestrial and aqueous phenomena differ in terms of governance strategies? What models have worked in each case in terms of dealing with borders, and which haven’t?

The name tells you most of it. It doesn't tell you that this used to be Ripples BBQ and Seafood restaurant but to all intents and purposes it is identical.
The venue is exactly the same. The ducks hanging in the front window, the aquarium next to the entrance, the cashier and bar set up,
pushing trolleys filled with small dishes also continue as before. Prices are marginally increased but pretty average for these meals.
The best thing was the quality of the dough in the dumplings. It was not too thick, well cooked and held the ingredients together well. Unfortunately the Singapore pork dumplings had no soup in them.
I fully endorse your comments on dim sum at Harmony. I enjoyed going to Ripples and now to Harmony. The renovations at the change of ownership have created a more spacious and comfortable restaurant without different levels in the main part of the dining room.
In April I held my eightieth birthday celebration at Harmony, eighty five guests at eight tables. Food and service were faultless. I commend dinner at Harmony.
By the way I suggest that the dim sum at Ripples, Bentleigh are also excellent with a greater variety than at Harmony.

Senior Project Manager Jim Beckerle is celebrating his 35th anniversary at Alberici this month. In honor of this milestone, we asked Jim to share some thoughts about his experience.
I have several favorites projects. Melvin Price Locks and Dam 26 was my first job, and I was in awe at all of the new equipment we bought for the project.
I enjoyed working on the three plant model changes that Alberici completed at Chrysler Belvidere from 1986 to 2006. Starting projects at the beginning of the construction scope development was a new way of doing business, and the owner completely trusted Alberici, knowing we were the contractor to follow through and complete the work.
The Holcim Ste. Genevieve Cement Plant is a recent favorite of mine simply because I was able to focus exclusively on the work in the field.
What do you enjoy most about your current role as Deputy Project Director at the Olmsted Dam project?
I enjoy being the lead Alberici representative and selling the resources Alberici has to offer to our joint venture (JV) partner and the owner. Hopefully exposure to the Alberici culture will positively influence the other members of our project team.
You’ve been at the mega-project, Olmsted, for a number of years. Can you share a little bit about your experience there? What makes this project different from others you’ve been on?
The size and scope of the project are amazing. Everything is big—including the largest Super Gantry Crane in the world and the 10-million-pound loads that the crane moves. There have also been a number of engineering innovations developed at the site to accomplish building the first “in the wet” navigable inland river dam.
I am most proud of being with Alberici for this long and being a team member at one of the top construction firms in the country.
I’ve always liked the small, family-owned atmosphere Alberici has to offer. Although we are a much larger company now than when I started, access to top management is not intimidating and that family-owned atmosphere still exists.
I think the two things that have changed the most are the attention we, as an industry, pay to safety and increased documentation of what you do in the field.
I would advise someone just starting out to get as much field experience they can and to get experience in the many markets and geographical areas Alberici serves.

* Am a bit embarrassed to ask, but if my flight into BFS is delayed, I could be pushed for time, so need to be certain.
If you mean via the gate opposite Olympia Street then that should be OK. It's the pedestrian access to the leisure centre beside the old Midgely Park gates/at the corner of the old Olympia 3g pitch which has gone.
we usually are in North stand going to the Kop west stand for this one, we come in from the adelaide train over the railway bridge/steps can we access the kop ok from there i assume?
You'll have to go in via Boucher if that's where the Kop entrance is. You're better going via Apollo Road from Adelaide station to Boucher rather than by the Windsor footbridge and Olympia Drive. There's a walkway at Adelaide which takes you to Apollo Road, then down past M&S and onto Boucher.
Still showing on Freesports schedule for Saturday, from 1:55. Sky Channel 424, also on Freeview (channel 95 I think). Freesports is a decent wee channel for random free football
Thanks for this. I will be at the match but it's good to be able to record and watch it again later.
Friendlies are traditionally terrible but for some reason I'm quite looking forward to this one now!
Unbelievable for a March friendly against South Korea, really looking forward to seeing Jordan Jones, this guy looks the real deal at club level, think he could be a real star in a green shirt.
I've been saying it for years now, but Belfast, like eg London, Glasgow, Liverpool or Manchester, is and always has been a proper football city.
All it needs to get people to attend in good numbers is a good manager and backroom set-up, which produces a competitive* side, playing in facilities which are up to contemporary standards.
Trying to find a bar here in Chiangmai in northern Thailand showing it - drawn a blank so far unsurprisingly ?
You would probably struggle to find a city centre bar in belfast who would be willing to show the match on saturday afternoon in case it offends someone.
Probably a better chance here then 'donaghy' - I'll continue my quest but I looks like I'll have to settle for the girlie bars down at the Thai Boxing arena to while away the night ?
Quite ironic actually as I was in the exactly same area when Ards played the Glens Seconds in the final of the Steel and Sons a few years back and I rang by brother every ten minutes or so for an update - Ards got tanked but that's the year the Glens played a 'ringer' and the trophy was taken off them but for some reason wasn't awarded to Ards.
At least this time I'll be able to follow the game on the 'net but with those ladies about I mightn't have any spare hands left to check my IPad ?
It’s not that I’m one of those “Apple sux, PC’s rule” people, but I’ve always enjoyed being able to get my hands dirty with my OS and up until the advent of OS X, anything from Apple just didn’t allow the end user a “hands-in” experience. Despite this, I recently purchased a gently used PowerBook 1400c on eBay and I now know much more about the Mac OS than I ever thought I would or could. This isn’t really a “how to” in the classic sense; it’s more of a “how NOT to lose your sanity” than anything else.
First, here are the reasons why I bought a seven year old laptop that has all the speed of an original Pentium:
1. If it’s a 1400C it has an active matrix screen. The 1400CS has a dual-scan passive matrix screen.
2. The machine came in three speeds: 117Mhz, 133Mhz, & 166Mhz. I have the 117Mhz and it’s painfully slow.
3. If you don’t have an original PB1400 install CD, you can not install OS 7.5.3! (This has been the biggest headache for me and my PB1400… Apple offers the full OS 7.5.3 install for free on their web site, but does not offer the PB1400 Enabler file.)
6. Unlike all other PowerBooks where you only hold down the C key, to boot from CD you need to hold down the command, option, shift and delete keys.
i remember my PB1400. I’ve been an apple man since day one. apple’s are great. compare the PB1400 to a Toshiba satelite pro from the same year, they dont match up. definitely run OS8.6, you can also make it dual bootable with Yellow Dog linux 2.2 if you want to. You should be able to hold down the Option key on start up to choose to boot from the CD, or hold down Cmd+C. If you put the G3 in it, upgrade to OS 9.2.1 and you should be set. OS X.1.5 will run on it, but it would be painfully slow because OSX needs at least 64mb of ram minimum.
Cannot say I am much impressed with the machine: although the processor is much faster than my 7200, it feels cosiderately slower: the video is really slow as molasses.
There is also the extremely annoying fact that it cannot record audio. It cannot keep up with a normal 44.1 stereo steam, which ens up full of glitches and clicks… That’s *really* sub standard performance!
There’s also a bug that makes it enter energy conservation mode after 10 minutes on batteries, and dims the already abysmally dim screen futhermore…
I had a PB 1400 CS 117. It was one of the most reliable laptops I’ve ever had. Eventually upgraded to G3 with a Sonnet card – but that reduced battery life to around 30 minutes.
what can be done in regards to using it for something audio related. I no longer have use of my Ethernet card so getting anythin off the machine is impossible. Maybe someone knows about a good stand alone plugin or something . PLEASE HELP
How can I make working my PB 1400c 117 with an Agere wifi pc card? do I need pc card manager? Please help me
I just got myself a powerbook 1400 to try out mac OS and come across your site.. I have some questions.. How do you check the OS version and other specifications of the laptop like RAM and processor speed? I also have some questions about the battery reconditioning program.. I tried running it and some buzzing sound appeared while the screen turned fuzzy..Is it supposed to be like that?
prologik- to check out the os version just click on the apple menu in the upper left hand corner and select “about this computer”, but I think to find out the processor speed you have to select “apple system profiler” in the apple menu. As for the battery reconditioning program, I had the same type of thing happen the first time I ran it, but I tried a different battery and it worked fine (a dialogue box came up and said that reconditioning was successful) . I haven’t tried the first battery again. I don’t believe that the buzzing is normal. Hope this helps.
Yes, I was wondering if someone could tell me what the problem might be with regard to the battery in my PB1400cs. I used the reconditioning program and got a rather unnerving buzzing sound. The dialogue read “recondition successful”,but every since then the battery meter display doesn’t show that the battery is receiving any charge. Does anyone have a clue to what might be the problem?

Prorating Maine real estate town or city taxes on the fiscal year should be easy, cut and dry simple right?
For starters, it used to be that every Maine town and city adopted, were guided by the April 1st to March 31 fiscal tax year golden rule. It was easy, simple and all towns fell in line. Everyone followed the same property tax structure template. But then in the 1980's, it seemed no two towns or cities had the same standardized property tax year. That was part of the confusion. Who's on first scenario.
The other hub bub started with the property listing owner. The guy, gal, or both named on the real estate property tax bill figures all paid in say late July or August when the bill came out. So all current, square. Not if the tax year in the town the property is in started last early spring and he is paying in somewhere close to the middle of the cycle.
The Maine real estate closing is where the HUD 1 closing statement reflects what the town or cities fiscal property tax year is. And how the taxes for the buyer and seller shake down, figure out as of the date of that real estate closing. If this year's property taxes are not known yet, the bill not mailed out, it can be figured on what the taxes were last year. But if they do go up, both parties agree to revisit and update the book keeping. Or it is spelled out that everything keeps sailing and the new buyer is on his own when the property tax bill does show up in the mailbox with a slight increase.
The property taxes for the seller are usually reflected as a credit on the HUD 1 standardized real estate closing tally accounting statement.
But when the Maine property tax bill does come out, the buyer can forget he received a credit from the seller months earlier at the real estate closing.
The buyer runs to the phone and asks the Maine real estate agent, broker, REALTOR hey, how come I get the entire bill for this year?
Any back property taxes from previous years are cleaned up and settled at the real estate closing. But unless both the buyer and seller of the property ante up a known, accepted figure for this year's taxes, confusion can happen. Loose ends, not dealing with this fiscal tax pro ration every day part of it.
Even when it gets figured out, all the parties start to recall the discussion about property tax proration at the real estate closing, it still boils down to someone has a bill to pay they did not figure on. Or a larger bill amount for property taxes than they had reckoned having to handle.
Discount for paying early can change the numbers slightly on property tax bills. And if the new buyer does not pay this year's property taxes when he receives the bill, guess what?
The seller, the owner of the property if the transaction happens after April 1st sees his name go up in lights, fresh bold black and white ink in the town report of delinquent taxpayers.
There is a legal process and legislation to address this situation so the seller's credit and reputation don't leave him with the dropped shoe. But still property tax pro rations are always a source contention, misunderstanding, elevated emotions.

Inspired by the homonymous armchair, this sofa bed has a unique personality. Although the tall headboard is reminiscent of the French Bergerè armchair, giving it an evergreen appeal, its innovated lines and slim armrests convey a very modern, almost futurist style.
The opening mechanism consists in tilting the backrest forwards until it is upside down below the bed base. It converts into a bed in one simple movement and doesn't require removal of the seat or backrest cushions. Sturdy and comfortable, with its electrowelded, 200 cm orthopaedic base, it can be used daily either at home or for the hospitality and contract markets.
A Move handle on wheels, which makes it easier to open and close the sofa bed, is available for the Modaku mechanism.

When you check Mercedes-benz Cl550 car engine light came on code P222B the reason should be . However Mercedes-benz manufacturer may have a different definition for the P222B OBD-II Diagnostic Powertrain (P) Trouble Code. So you should chech it on our car models.
P222B Mercedes-benz Cl550 engine diagnostic code is about in terms of how often you should get your tyres rotated, it's different for every vehicle and type of tyre, but having them rotated at every oil change is a good rule of thumb. Check with the tyre manufacturer for a more specific time frame. Remember that the more often you rotate your tyres, the more evenly they'll wear, and when you have the tyres rotated, you should also get them checked for balance and alignment.
OBD P222B Mercedes-benz Cl550 code and tailpipe testing are two different approaches to identify vehicles in need of repair. The OBD system looks for broken or malfunctioning emissions control components and , while tailpipe tests sample a vehicle's exhaust to see if it is above or below certain prescribed limits. Given the robust nature of today's emissions control components, it is entirely possible for an individual component to P222B Mercedes-benz Cl550 malfunction without leading to an immediate increase in emissions at the tailpipe. In such cases, other components (like the catalyst) can temporarily compensate for the part that is broken however, these other components can only do double duty for so long before they, too, begin to malfunction. In addition, OBD also monitors for P222B Mercedes-benz Cl550 and other malfunctions in the fuel system problems that traditional tailpipe tests were not designed to identify. Most state and local areas also include a gas cap pressure test as part of an emission inspection.

The TaxSlayer Center - formerly the iWireless Center and The Mark of The Quad Cities - has been the jewel of our community since it's opening just over 20 years ago. The arena has been home to championship teams and memorable concerts.The price of making new memories at the venue could be rising soon.
According to a local published report, TaxSlayer Center management is looking for a larger cut from ticket prices for events they host.
The venue currently receives a 3% cut of ticket sales for events, but they are looking to up that percentage to five from events that draw at least 8,000 people.
Manager Dave Mullen says the extra revenue, estimated at $160,000 is needed to help support local teams like the Steamwheelers and a replacement hockey team for the now defunct Mallards.
Moline City Council is the arbiter of whether the TaxSlayer Center gets a bigger piece of the ticket sales pie. They were presented with the plan yesterday and will discuss it at their next meeting.

Few spell casters are qualified to cast an Extreme spell as preparation time for each spell is time consuming, and the spell casting itself is very intense and often emotionally draining. However, the extra time and effort is worth it due to the spectacular results that often occur.
Although the cost of an Extreme spell can be prohibitive, only here at PaganShop1.Com these extremely powerful spells will be cast
Extreme spells are just what they imply: Spells intended to help those who feel they are on the edge and have nowhere else to turn. They are cast specifically for those who have tried everything else to no avail.
What is more important than knowing you are in a loving relationship with someone who only has eyes for you?
Your spell will be carefully prepared, then starting early evening I will cast your spell for the first time for a few hours, repeating the spell for the next 7 days for extreme power. This is a very draining and demanding spell for even the most gifted spell caster.
I had no where else to turn, I was going crazy and desperate, and you saved my life! I hope I'm protected, safe and happy till the day I day! Thank...

Heat the oven to 180 degrees. Mix the lemon peel with the sugar, then mix the butter and sugar until it goes to light cream. Add the eggs one by one, after each shake the mixture to its full absorption. Add the lemon juice and shake until everything is creamy. Add flour and mix by hand. The capsules should be filled three quarters of their volume. Bake for about 15 minutes until muffins rise up and turn pink.
Once they cool off well, with the help of a tool for cleaning seeds or small knife scrape small cylinders in the muffins. Fill the holes with lemon cream. This cream can be prepared 2-3 days earlier. If you do it the same day, you should start with its preparation so the cream can cool off while you are preparing the cupcakes.
Combine all ingredients, excluding butter and cream in saucepan and heat the mixture stirring constantly. Stir with a wooden spoon or silicone spatula. Boil on medium heat, about 10-15 minutes until it begins to “dress” the spoon but not to stick to the bottom of the pan.
When you finished remove from the hot plate and begin to add cream and butter spoon by spoon while stirring. If you want you can strain the mixture to remove the remains from lemon peel. Cover with fresh foil.
Cupcakes can be sealed with the lids from the carved muffins or after cooling the cream to cover directly with coloured fondant.
Stir eggs with the sugar. Add cream and coffee. All dry ingredients are mixed and mixed with the liquid mixture. Add chocolate, broken into small pieces and mix carefully. Forms muffins are filled to 3/4. Bake in a preheated oven 200 C for approximately 20-30 minutes.

Bake 20-25 minutes in a preheated 200 degrees oven until ready, check with a toothpick. Remove from oven, cool for 5 minutes and remove cupcakes from the form. If desired, sprinkle top with plenty of powdered sugar.
Heat the oven to 180 C . Prepare tray with 12 cups, put butter on the bottoms of each or place paper baskets.

The Business License Officer (Village Clerk) oversees the licensure of businesses located within the jurisdiction of the Village of Northbrook. At the present time, the Municipal Code does not require the licensing of home occupations, except for daycare service facilities operated as a home occupation.
The Zoning Code does permit home businesses, however, it does not allow more than 4 persons who are employees, clients, or independent contractors of the home occupation and are not domiciled in the dwelling units at one time. Day care service facilities operating as a home occupation shall be allowed attendance of up to 8 children, including family members, at any one time. (See Northbrook Zoning Code, Section 9-102 C. Use Limitations). Please submit a Zoning Analysis Application (PDF) to ensure your business is compliant with the Zoning Code.
Please note that certain businesses may require zoning approval or have a license restriction. It will then be necessary to contact the zoning or licensing department for clarification. Examples of a category that has a restriction or zoning issue would be a tobacco "only" facility or a restaurant.
Please note that all new businesses must have fire and zoning inspections prior to receiving their business license. Please schedule these with the following contacts:

The 2016 Goffstown State primary is Tuesday, September 13th. On the Republican Ballot, there are 9 contested races. On the Democrat ballot, only one contested race, for Governor.
Below, please find links to the official Town Election page as well as a sample for the Republican ballot that includes links to stories and campaign websites. Just hover your mouse over a candidates name and click. Please note: Not all candidates will have a link due to lack of available information.
The 2015 Goffstown School Deliberative Session is in the books. I would estimate there were about 36, to not more than 50, residents in attendance. Of that, maybe about 20 were not related to School personal, School Board or Budget Committee. Kind of sad, and a big difference from days gone by when you’d have 100’s in attendance.
For those attending, it was wonderful to touch base with old friends and watch the awards being passed out. A great video by GTV was shown commemorating the award recepiants. Log onto the link above to watch the video. Presentation of awards starts at 14:15.
The School Board presentation on the School Operating Budget starts at around 27:13. More details can be found on the Goffstown School District website.
Bottom line: Tax impact of the School Operating Budget is $1.51. Tax impact of the School district default budget is $1.48.
Elected Officials attending were Senator Lou D’Allesandro and NH House Representatives Pierce, Griffin and Rouillard. Budget Committee members, Dubrulle (chair), Manney, French, Spoerl, Pierce, Mitchell, McCarthy and Lemay. Also Selectman, Adams and Lemay.

the change in Tory Leadership was a certainty after Brexit, the identity of the new Prime Minister came as a surprise to me. The immediate scrapping of DECC (also a complete surprise to me, who knew her views on Global Warming?) still seems to me like a fairly conclusive statement of intent, even if a fresh budget was not announced.
The UK's Global Warming budget has stripped proper sciences of research money, and misappropriated Overseas Aid for local misappropriation. I don't know how many other programmes have suffered due to Global Warming wastage, but how many people have had to mention Global Warming in order to obtain research funding in UK Universities?
I am not anticipating "Carbon Taxes" to be scrapped. Chancellors do not look at gift horses in the mouth, that was, after all, one of the selling points of global warming to financiers, increased tax revenue.
Al Capone was not jailed for killing people, but tax evasion. Climate Science is not being banned or declared illegal. The US is just going to stop funding it. The Guardian has been campaigning for people and companies to "divest" from fossil fuels, perhaps The Guardian campaign inspired Trump?
The climaterati are well established behind sandbags full of other people's money. Where will they go to hide next financial year, let alone fire from?
Obviously Skeptical Skience will carry on the fight because they rely on private finance. Allegedly. Many from Skeptical Skience also write for The Guardian. Is money changing hands, if so, which way? How much of Climate Science's publicity machine, and mercenary army of attack dogs will be celebrating Christmas 2017?
2016 has been the best year evah (!) for political banana skins, and I certainly did not anticipate any of it. No complaints at all.
I still don't know whether Climate Science made one or more errors when they decided (behind closed doors, in secret, without telling anyone else) that CO2 was guilty of everything that had ever gone wrong since the industrial revolution. No minutes have ever been produced of the clandestine meetings, however Hillary Clinton may yet have more EMail correspondence locked away on a Sinclair ZX 81 in an unmarked offshore bank vault.
Whilst Climate Science remains in complete DENIAL of ever making a single mistake about anything, I can only agree that everything about climate science should be treated as suspect. Climate Science is guilty, it now needs to prove the innocence of it's mistakes.
golfCharlie. You should be careful about using "fairy 'nuff", it's very powerful stuff. Sho'nuff is more common but not so potent, but all should stand well clear of the Arabian mobster and climateer Nuff Said.
This is what Wikipedia says, and it quotes the IPCC. So on the assumption that both were written by the same experts:
The climate sensitivity (ECS) refers to the equilibrium change in global mean near-surface air temperature that would result from a sustained doubling of the atmospheric (equivalent) carbon dioxide concentration (ΔTx2). As estimated by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) "there is high confidence that ECS is extremely unlikely less than 1°C and medium confidence that the ECS is likely between 1.5°C and 4.5°C and very unlikely greater than 6°C."[4] This is a change from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), which said it was likely to be in the range 2 to 4.5 °C with a best estimate of about 3 °C, and is very unlikely to be less than 1.5 °C. Values substantially higher than 4.5 °C cannot be excluded, but agreement of models with observations is not as good for those values.[5] The IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) said it was "likely to be in the range of 1.5 to 4.5 °C".[6] Other estimates of climate sensitivity are discussed later on."
It refers to "ESTIMATES" for ECS. It is presumed/assumed that ECS is greater than 1.5. Is the missing X factor, phantom multiplier, or whatever you want to call it, the reason why climate science has got it all wrong?
I am not a mathematician, but if it is assumed ECS is between 1.5 and 4.5, that is a fair margin of error, but why can't it be less than 1.5? Or nothing at all?
Climate Science is very sensitive about low sensitivity, and tends to get hot under the collar. Their attacks on Lewis and Curry would be legendary, but they are true. On the basis of hostile reception, this seems to me, to be a good place to start looking for where climate science evolved into a disaster. What percentage of climate science papers could be scrapped, without further wasted money, by throwing out all papers, authors, co-authors, that have relied on ECS being greater than 1?
Translating EM to plain honest talk: "I can't discuss my faith with the faithless if they keep relying on facts, so I will stomp off, praying to the internet god's for the internet censorship the denialists so richly deserve."
ACK, the fairies inhabiting the bottom of most gardens believe in Climate Science, but their magic dust has failed to reveal the cause of the pause, so they had to wish it away with computer aided pixel power.
Assuming a linear warming effect, a doubling of CO2 would therefore be expected to produce an increase of 100/40 * 1 = 2.5C.
If that is so, why is the temperature on Venus where the pressure 1 at. not 27°C warmer than it is now? Why does it remain 66°C when, by your figures, it should be at least 93°C?
You really don’t get it, do you, Entropic man? You continue to claim that you are a scientist, yet you continue to cleave to the myth that the warming is only because of increasing CO2 in the atmosphere – where is the empirical evidence? Answer: there is none.
Can you not consider that there could be something else, other than changing CO2 levels, that might have an effect upon global warming/climate change? “Human generated CO2”, by its very definition, has only been since the start of the Industrial Revolution, yet the global temperatures and climates have been changing upwards and downwards since the birth of the planet. What caused the decline from the Mediaeval Warm Period to the Little Ice Age? What cause the rise from the Dark Ages to the Mediaeval Warm Period? What caused the decline from the Roman Warm period to the Dark Ages?
This could go on and on and on, and you would not be able to answer one of them – because WE HAVE NO IDEA! We have theories and suppositions and possibilities, but that is all they are, and all they will ever be – no actual, verifiable, definitive cause will ever be found. It is the same for the present – we have NO REAL IDEA what is happening; the best we can do is monitor it, and devise methods to improve that monitoring, so that we might – just might – be able to determine what is causing these changes. Whether we will ever be able to devise methods to actually affect the changes, or even to effect changes to our benefit are dreams for you in La-La-Land.
Faieries need their full quota of vowels and should not be confused with pixies (dusty types) who, as you suggest, might well use their charms creating climate models. Garden bottoms are more likely to be the territories of next door Toms who would welcome a drier climate.
Congratulations. You have found a soulmate in Senator Roberts. You share a similar cognitive dissonance.
Can you not consider that there could be something else, other than changing CO2 levels, that might have an effect upon global warming/climate change?
To the contrary, there are many variables which have changed climate at one time or another; industry, land use volcanoes, solar intensity, Milankovich cycles, position of continents etc. The problem is tha when you measure them the sum of all the natural variations is neutral.. That leavies humanity as the only significant warming driver at present.
I've been a bit out of sorts with regard to commenting on climate issues lately, but this from EM shook me up:
"The problem is tha[t] when you measure them the sum of all the natural variations is neutral.. That leaves humanity as the only significant warming driver at present."
That first sentence is one heck of a claim. It might be obvious to the climate alarmism community, but it certainly isn't obvious to me, and I'd love to see it expanded upon. Any takers?
You only have to look at the Earth's geological history when some of the climate-determining factors (some mentioned by EM) varied, and over time produced very different global climates. These varied to perhaps their greatest degree at the end of the Palaeozoic and during the early Mesozoic. During the Upper Carboniferous (Pennsylvanian in N. America) there was rapid climate and sea-level changes, in part caused by Gondwana glaciations, which resulted in widespread coal deposits across N. America and Eurasia. This contrasts with the later Upper Permian and Triassic where the huge supercontinent promoted global aridity and the formation of red sediments (many wind blown) and salt deposits. In the UK this enormous global climatic change is embarked by the change from the grey sediments of the Coal Measures to overlying red sandstones and marls, some contaiining salts (as in the Cheshire Basin).
These changes clearly indicate that the non-human climate factors do not cancel each out, producing neutrality. As I've already written that is "bilge".
ACK, if Climate Science is to get a full quota of fairiy vowels, a bit more "ou" is required. This could be an ou to rhyme and mean the same as ooh, or où as in where is French Climate Science.
Mark Hodgson, if CO2 is the only driver "AT PRESENT", then what drove the Climate in the past? Nobody knows, so Mann deleted the past with the shaft of his Hockey Stick, so Climate Science could pretend that the only explanation was man made CO2. History was wiped from the memories of climate science, historians, archaeologists, geologists etc.
"Bad Law" results from rushed legislation (Dangerous Dogs Act?) or gradual evolution with case law. Rapid advances in Medical Science have been keeping ahead of the legal concept of "life" and "death".
Science has major advances with a single discovery, and then lots of smaller advances. Climate Science hinges on a few big assumptions. One of those is ECS. The accepted theory is as EM describes above, I presume, because I would not know better. ECS is an "X" factor, that multiplies everything else, that can not be clearly defined or calculated. As someone with a background in troubleshooting technical issues, it does seem worthy of further investigation.
Data is adjusted to make theoretical models match reality. I have no idea what happens when you leave the data alone but adjust the ECS. I expect Climate Scientists will say they have tried that, and it didn't work. What it may mean is that they no longer got the scary stories they had been banking on (very nicely) for 20+ years. There are only about 100 days left to save climate science, and climate science remains in Denial about making a mistake. Evah!
You can’t even keep up to date with yourself, can you, Entropic man? Remember the figure 66°C? This is the temperature that the Earth’s surface would be, were it the same distance from the Sun as Venus; this is a figure that you have agreed with many times past, as well as a figure arrived at by a range of people you have not disagreed with. Coincidentally, it is also the temperature of the Venusian atmosphere at altitudes where the pressure is 1 at. Remarkable, no?
Now, according to you (Nov 20, 2016 at 3:02 PM), environmental climate sensitivity is 2.5°C per doubling; the atmosphere of Venus is nearly 97% CO2, or more than 11 “doublings” of Earth’s present concentration – hence the ECS dictates that the temperature of the atmosphere of Venus should be about (11 x 2.5)°C warmer than it is – i.e. about +27°C, giving the supposed temperature on Venus at altitudes where the pressure is 1 at. (66 + 27)°C, or 93°C, at least. However, it isn’t; it remains at 66°C (remember that number?) – surely – surely – even to you, that means that there has to be something else involved in this planetary warming thingy that you are either unaware of or just ignoring.
But, no, you are, in your petty, pedantic, ignorant arrogance utterly convinced that YOU are right, and everyone else is wrong. I know that others have been in similar situations before, but even Einstein admitted that it would only take one fact to prove him wrong; with you, however, every fact proves you wrong, yet you still maintain that you are right! That is taking stupid to completely new levels.
If only Neanderthals had worked out how to use a QWERTY keyboard and MS-DOS, with a wooden club and spear, sabre-toothed tigers might still roam the earth, and climate scientists would now have more accurate historic weather records, that they could adjust to suit their selfish modern needs.
I shall repeat the question I asked earlier, when I gave you a link to one who has also asked that question of one of the world’s leading climate science organisations, the CSIRO, and which, bizarrely, you then use to attempt to disparage me (or him – who knows?) by saying that we are soul-mates. A very odd ad hominem attack, as I would rather be soul-mate to one who seeks Truth, than one who seeks to ignore it, or, even worse, to conceal it. So, the question: what empirical evidence is there that increasing CO2 in the atmosphere is causing the atmosphere to warm? Answer: CSIRO could provide none. Perhaps, if you have such evidence, you could get yourself a bit of international recognition and provide CSIRO with that evidence that they will now crave and would no doubt be willing to pay absolutely anything to have.
(note: it does have to be empirical evidence, and replicable; just saying, “It is so, trust me,” does not count.)
When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever... "You will not apply my precept," he said, shaking his head. "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know that he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is no concealment possible. When, then, did he come?"
Climate Scientists claim to have eliminated all possible reasons why they might be wrong. Clearly they have made a mistake somewhere, no matter how impossible or improbable that sounds, but they are hardly going to admit it now, even if they have known for a while .....
The 33 degC greenhouse effect is a gravitational by-product when a planet has a radiative atmosphere. Anyone theorising trapped energy by any mechanism is barking (up the wrong tree). A temperature increase in a gas does not require an energy increase - only a decrese in volume. Gravity on Earth decreases the volume that is radiating to space near the surface but has no effect on energy radiation to space. The source of all energy in Earth's atmosphere (the background temperature of space and radioactive decay in its core being insignificant) is the Sun. CO2 does not add to that.
ssat. Small correction (does not affect your argument, because geothermal heat only constitutes 0.03% of the Earth's heat budget). Heat from radioactive decay comes from the crust and mantle, not the core.
ACK, as Climate Scientists threw away all knowledge of science and history that disagreed with their faith, I wonder whether leaving out that teeny weeny 00.03% geothermal heat has caused all their models to overheat.
When they get frightfully excited about CO2 rising from 00.03% - 00.04%, there does seem to be some symmetry in the number of zeroes that make up Climate Science, and them not amounting to very much.
The Earth's temperature seems to have been overall increasing (but with significant ups and downs) since the end of the little ice age. And on a longer time scale, with bigger ups and downs, since the end of the last real ice age.
To say "The 40% increase in CO2 since 1880 has produced a temperature increase of 1C" is an assertion by faith. There is a plausibility argument that CO2 has had something to do with it, but nothing better than that. Based on extrapolating what went on from 1600 to 1880, it's equally plausible to assert that CO2 had nothing much to do with it at all.
The theoretical calculations of so-called "radiative forcing" give results which roughly fit a logarithmic curve. So "assuming a linear warming effect", even for someone who has bought into the rest of the CO2 mumbo jumbo, is a dodgy assumption to say the least.
Yes it would - if all the other unverified assumptions and hypotheses of climate science were known to be valid.
But if no attention is paid to unverified assumptions, then ECS = 0 is by no means an impossible value.
golfCharlie. "there does seem to be some symmetry in the number of zeroes that make up Climate Science". Just WHO are you refering to - the "usual suspects"?
So desperate to show a significant effect of delta CO2 that the obvious has to be ignored in favour of the speculative, even with no agreement on the latter.

Gioseffo Guami (January 27, 1542 - 1611) (Gioseffo Giuseppe Guami or Gioseffo da Lucca) was an Italian composer, organist, violinist and singer of the late Renaissance Venetian School. He was a prolific composer of madrigals and instrumental music, and was renowned as one of the finest organists in Italy in the late 16th century; he was also the principal teacher of Adriano Banchieri.

Drivers must have held a full UK or EU driving license for a minimum of 2 years, be aged between 23 and 80 and have no more than 6 penalty points.
Minibus drivers will require category D1, have 2 years driving experience and must be over 30 years of age.
We can cater for license holders from Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America and Canada without prior clearance from our insurer. Drivers require at least 2 years driving experience and must be over 25 years old and under 75 years old.
Anyone from outside of these territories will need an International Drivers permit to authenticate/supplement the license and to assist in translation. Pre-authorisation will be required to facilitate hire and needs to be done at least 48 hours in advance and is only available Monday - Friday.
Aside from the license we require an additional form of identification which matches the address shown on the license (Utility bill, bank statement, council tax bill etc. If the license does not provide photographic identification then supplementary ID will be required, such as a passport
UK license holders are also required to provide a 'check code' from the DVLA's website (www.gov.uk/view-driving-licence) in order that we can check for penalty points. If you are unable to obtain this we can do it for you providing you know your National Insurance number.
UK license holders that are unable to obtain a check code and don't have access to their National Insurance number may still be able to hire. This requires a call to DVLA's premium rate number of which we charge a flat rate of £5 for. (This service is only available 8am-6pm Monday-Friday and 8am-2pm on Saturday)
The quoted cost of hire includes: the rental, insurance for one named driver, VAT, breakdown assistance and road fund tax. We do not charge mileage.
A maximum of three drivers can be insured on the vehicle, a one off charge of £10 per additional driver will be levied. Each driver must fulfill the criteria set out in the terms and conditions listed.
While in charge of our vehicles the client is responsible for the following excess. A pre-authorsation (holding deposit) for the same amount will need to be processed on a debit or credit card (this amount can be reduced by taking CDW - Collision Damage Waiver)
As we have a selection of petrol and diesel vehicles your rental assistant will give guidance as to what the vehicle requires on check out, for clarity the fuel type is also marked on the bottom line of your rental agreement.
Fuel is on a 'like-for-like' basis, in other words if you start with 1/4 tank please return the same.
There is some give and take in this regard but blatant short fueling will result in fuel costs being recovered from the holding deposit / pre authorised payment.
The holding deposit is done via pre-authorisation and must be done by debit/credit card - please be aware that some cards do not allow this type of transaction.
For clarity a pre-authorised payment requires cleared funds, as the amount comes out of your available balance. As this is a banking process the funds take 10 working days to clear back to the account from the moment they are taken.
Should the hire period exceed 10 workings days the holding deposit may be taken as a clear funds payment and refunded on retun of the vehicle.
We take a 50% deposit on advance bookings, this is none refundable as per the Consumer Contracts Regulations (2014).

It's finally here...After years in the making, an advance copy of my first book arrived on Friday. Back in 2010 I visualized this very book, and now it has arrived and I couldn't be happier. The folks at Schiffer Publishing have been tremendous throughout this process, and I'm very pleased with the result. I'm told the bulk of the copies are still 6-8 weeks out from release, but I'll be sharing updates as I get them.
Thank you to Jerry Hancock & Robert M Craig for their contributions to this book! There are so many more I wish to thank and hopefully I can do so at a book launch party in the near future.
Several websites offer databases that make it easy to search for local rescue groups. Below are a few of the most popular.
The Petfinder home page offers a search form that allows you to enter your location and the type, breed, age, and gender of the pet you want. You can further refine your results to only include certain features, such as pets that are housetrained. When you click on a pet's photograph, you will be able to view detailed information on personality and other features. Petfinder also includes information about the application process and preferred contact methods for each group.
Adopt a Pet also features a convenient search function on its home page. The search includes tabs for dogs, cats, and other pets and offers a function that allows you to search by shelter or rescue group. You will find plenty of information on each pet and a thorough explanation of the adoption process. When you sign up for New Pet Alerts, you will be emailed when a pet has been added that meets your criteria.
The Petango website also allows you to narrow your search by type, breed, and location. Petango offers real-time updates on adoptable animals across thousands of animal welfare locations in North America.
Are you interested in adopting a pet from a rescue group but aren't sure if it's the best option for you? We answer a few common questions about rescue groups and explain how adoptions work.
Shelters are usually run by cities or municipalities, while humane societies are managed by non-profit organizations. Both offer buildings where you can visit pets and meet with an adoption counselor. Open access shelters and humane societies accept all animals, but may euthanize pets if they run out of room, while limited access shelters only accept animals deemed highly adoptable.
Rescue groups may also conduct adoptions in their own building, but more often, they house animals in foster homes or local kennels. They can be run by one person or by a non-profit organization. Rescue groups are typically limited access and may only accept animals that are most likely to find homes.
Adopting a pet is a big decision. After all, you will be caring for the animal for the rest of its life. Before you make the decision to adopt, ask yourself the following questions:
Rescue groups want to make sure that you and the pet you choose are a good match. They will ask questions about your lifestyle, work schedule, family members, and property to ensure that the adoption will work out for you and your new pet.
Although these questions may seem intrusive, they help the rescue group staff ensure that animals will be happy in their new homes for the rest of their lives.
The questions also help the staff assist you in finding the best pet for your circumstances. For example, if you live a small studio apartment without a yard, they may point out that a high-energy husky may not be the best choice and recommend smaller, lower-energy breeds that may be a better option.
In some cases, you may be able to take your new pet home the same day you meet him or her. Some groups may want to pay a visit to your home and check your references before they approve the adoption. Many rescue groups include the cost of immunizations and spaying or neutering in the adoption fee. During your visit, make sure you understand which services are covered by the fee.
Are you planning to adopt a new friend? Regular veterinary care is an important aspect of pet ownership. Call us to schedule an appointment for your new pet.

Johnathan Gray had his way with Oklahoma's defense in this year's Red River Shootout. (Photo courtesy: USA Today Sports)
As I mentioned yesterday in the aftermath of Texas’ 36-20 win over Oklahoma in the Red River Shootout, the story of the game to me was the Longhorns’ ability to dominate up front in the running game. With two key pieces missing up the middle for OU, defensive tackle Jordan Phillips and Corey Nelson, UT ran right at the Sooners’ depleted front, generating 255 yards on 60 carries.
Honestly, from the moment the Crimson and Cream D trotted out to start the season in a new 3-3-5 alignment, I had been waiting for this to happen. All defensive schemes require trade-offs, and with the 3-3-5, you’re asking to get trucked by a power running game. You could see the signs of it against Notre Dame, which ran for more than 7 yards per attempt versus an OU D that did have Phillips and Nelson in the lineup.
Texas had the personnel to capitalize on OU’s weakness up front. The only question before the game was if UT offensive coordinator Major Applewhite realized that:
Texas’ dominance in the running game on Saturday underscored the impact of some lean recruiting years on the defensive side of the ball, particularly along the defensive line. Of the 24 DLs signed by the Sooners in the last five recruiting classes, nine of them either left the program or never made it in. The 2009 and 2010 classes, which would make up the players who would be fourth- and fifth-year seniors this season, saw six of 10 DL signees wash out. Add in the 2011 class, and the flameout ratio rises to eight of 14.
A few months ago, Bob and Mike Stoops covertly decided that Oklahoma would scrap its plans to run a 4-2-5 defensive scheme and implement the 3-3-5 instead. It’s more than reasonable to assume that all of the attrition up front played a role in a decision that was made so late in the game.
Yet, even in instituting a three-man front, Saturday’s loss showed that the Sooners remain perilously thin along the DL, not to mention the situation at linebacker. The lack of functional depth finally came home to roost.
Looking ahead, the good news for OU is that very few opponents left on the schedule this season are explicitly built to tax this defense with a physical ground game. Unfortunately, the margin for error with this roster is growing smaller, too.

8. Have you had any experience in any other private server with a staff position? yes ive been co-owner, hidden admin and a moderator.
Well null and null's staff should pick me to be a nullscape moderator because i often help people alot. I play the server alot and when needed even help out staff.

<1> Attach thin vibrating wires to the branches of two oppositely-growing trees. As the wires are stretched due to natural tree growth – or given slack – the wind blowing across them will produce different notes. A tree that began as, say, C-major will become B-flat. This could be done to a variety of trees, using a variety of wires of various lengths and thicknesses, so as to produce an acres-wide arborial instrument which never ceases to change its drone.
<2> Attach a large stone to a system of ropes and pulleys. Attach the other ends of these ropes and pulleys to the branches of growing trees, and then again, onward, to the branches of other growing trees. As the branches grow, if the force has been correctly distributed, the stone will be lifted off the ground.
<2a> Once the stone leaves the ground, another, secondary, mechanical process could come into effect: say a turning wheel that tightens and/or otherwise alters the positions of the original ropes and pulleys.
<2b> This could start-off further mechanical processes – perhaps a bag of seeds is upended and, a dozen years later, new trees grow, entering the system.
<3> Plant a new grove using only one tree species, and rope the branches of all the trees together according to a carefully architected pattern. Return over the years as the trees grow to tighten the ropes, pulling and bending the branches into their desired shape or mold. Eventually the trees will form a complicated network of hallways whose canopies are interlaced branches. Domes, arches, etc., could all be created.
<4> A rope is attached to the top of a newly-planted tree. The other end of the rope is attached to a complex spring-and-coil machine that includes within it a pre-sharpened axe. The axe is attached to a long handle, a handle whose length is the exact distance between the machine and the tree. Further, the axe is only barely restrained from swinging by a small lever. Once the tree, several years on, has reached a certain height, the rope's tension triggers the machine, lifting that small lever, and the axe swings round, burying itself into the tree's trunk: killing – perhaps felling – the tree.

Australia must act now to combat dementia, which is set to become the 'major illness of the century', an expert has warned. <?<p>
Glenn Rees, Executive Director of Alzheimers Australia, was reacting to figures released by Alzheimer's Illness International in September that show there will be 115.4 million people with the illness by 2050. 'Australia will be hit hard by this chronic health condition,' he told The Australian. 'Access Economics predicts that by 2050 there will be 7,400 new cases of dementia each week, and 1.3 million Australians will live with the illness.'
The current cost of dementia to Australia's economy is already rising, Glenn warned. 'It is estimated at about $5 billion a year, and projections indicate that the illness will become the third greatest source of health and residential aged care spending within two decades.'
Those responsible for health policy must give dementia a similar level of attention and resources allocated to cancer and heart illness, Glenn said. This includes dementia education and training for doctors, who should work closely with nurses. 'There is a need for the employment of practice nurses to better assess and maintain the active management of patients with dementia,' Glenn said.

Okay this is the cutest idea that ever happened. They are mini pies (filled with fruit or chicken pot pie filling) that you pre-make and serve up when you want. So dang cute I can’t wait to make them.
9. When ready set your oven at 375. Pull a few from the freezer and toss them into the oven for about 45 minutes. (Let them warm up with the oven so you don’t have any cold glass in oven issues).
10. When they are bubbly and warm throughout you serve and eat them in the JARS, is that adorable? I cant stand it, so cute.
If making chicken pot pies, and you can stand to do it, skip the crust on the insides of the jar and just add a top crust. It will save on the calories.

Teacher REMCO BAARS shares a student essay, written as a task for NCEA biology standard B1.2: Biological Issues.
Antibiotic resistance is a battle in which we are the underdog, writes Year 11 biology student KRISTEN BLABER-HUNT.
Would you do more or less practical work if assessment constraints were removed, asks DENIS BURCHILL.
Vocational pathways are designed to provide new ways to structure and achieve NCEA, as Josh Williams, Youth Guarantee Vocational Pathways’ Manager, at the Ministry of Education, explains:
One of the most topical scientific issues of the 21st Century has to be the antibiotic resistance of microbes. This issue threatens, at its worst, to take our health system back to the brink of the 20th Century. At its best, it is causing a paradigm shift in policy, and thoughts and practises around the application, distribution and cost of antibiotics.As Science educators, we are the banner bearers of change. What we teach, and how we teach it, can expedite vital social change around attitudes to health, and particularly the expectations we place upon our medical practitioners. »

John was the eldest of three known children born to Archibald MacPhail and Anne MacPherson on the Isle of Mull.
On 10th August 1835 aged 26, he married 21 year old Isabella Stewart, the daughter of Dugald Stewart (farmer) and Effy Fletcher. At that time he was recorded as living at Ardnadrochit, approximately 3 miles south of Craignure and a short distance from Lochdon.
Two of their four children appear to have been born at Ardnadrochit in the Torosay Parish (Hugh in 1836 and Mary in 1838), while Ann (1840) and Archibald (1842) were born at Glenbyre in the Kinlochspelvie Parish.
At a time when people didn't travel very far, we now know John had lived as a child at Rohill and Kilberg and, as an adult, at Ardnadrochit and Glenbyre. The move to Glenbyre would have been made in approximately 1839 (sometime after Mary's birth in 1838 and prior to Ann's birth in 1840).
Like his father, he was a farmer (and possibly also a cattle drover), a tacksman leasing a large tract of land at Glenbyre from Murdoch Maclaine ('Young Murdoch'), 20th of Lochbuy.
"Within the area of Kinlochspelvie and Lochbuie there were 10,000 acres including some of the finest grazings and arable lands in Mull"
John and Isabella lived at Glenbyre House, a two-storied stone walled house situated on the shingle and pebble shores of Loch Buie's western bank. Now sadly derelict, this house still stands today although appears to have had additions made over the years. The original house was possibly what was known as a 'butt and ben' (a house having two rooms upstairs and two rooms downstairs). A stone walled sheep pen stands on the property and the house is sheltered at the rear by rolling hills which would have made excellent grazing for the sheep and highland cattle John would have farmed. Today the hills are bare however the remoteness and beauty of the location makes the area popular for walking or tramping, with the Loch being popular for fishing.
The 1841 census shows the family at Glenbyre House as - Isabella, Anne (neé MacPherson - John's mother who was now a widow), the three children, Hugh (4), Mary (2) & Anne (18 months) as well as Angus Fletcher, Duncan Paterson, Anne MacPhail and Marion Fletcher. Although still alive in 1841, John wasn't recorded at Glenbyre House on census night.
John died at Glenbyre on 5 November 1842 aged 33, just five years after his father's death and shortly after his youngest son, Archibald's, birth.
Isabella remained at Glenbyre House as she appears as head of the household in the 1851 census (and described as a farmer), together with her mother-in-law Anne, children Hugh (14), Mary (12), Ann/"Nancy" (10), Archibald (8), Malcolm Currie and Anne McEachern.
Both John and Isabella had short lives, indicative of the challenging times in which they lived where hard work and a strong spirit would constantly be tested by famine, disease, crop/stock losses and uncompromising landlords.
A marble plaque in memory of John and Isabella can be found alongside that of his father and mother, Archibald MacPhail and Anne MacPherson, on the south wall of the chapel ruins in the Pennygowan Cemetery.

Cat eyes encompass both a heavy lining on the top and bottom lines to provide the full shape of a cat's eye. The winged look is only the top liner and occasionally lining of the inner corner. A cat eye is generally much more dramatic of a look. It's used for more dressed up makeup, like for events and evening wear. The winged look is often more casual and great for day wear. Below, we are going to see 4 new takes on the classic yet dramatic cat eye!
When stuck in a rut, flip it up; upside down that is! The inverted cat eye is bold and over the top. The wing is on the bottom. This look elongates your eye even more than the traditional cat eye. It is a great look for anyone with a smaller forehead because it opens up the face drastically. Plus, creating an inverted cat eye means you don't have to fuss with eyeshadow or heavy lips because the liner is all the boldness you will need.
2018 fashions have all been about being bold and lawless. One take on the cat eye that follows that trend is the rounded cat eye! It kind of reminds us of a nubbed cat's tail, but still looks way more awesome! This look has been seen on Tom Ford's & Jason Wu's runways and Lady GaGa's Joanne tour making it a full blow trend must try. This look is best created with a dark colored eyeshadow and rounded brush. Yep, a liner look that doesn't even need the liner!
What better way to shake things up than adding some color! This take on the cat's eye is perfect to customize to your own look or eye color too. The layered look is accomplished by adding a thin line of color above your traditional cat eye. Never be afraid to stop at one extra layer either, some MUAs have been seen sporting a whole rainbow and we gotta say its even more beautiful than you would imagine.
This look kind of changes your cat eye into a winged look but what the heck because it is gorgeous! It's created by changing out your underliner from black to colored. This change keeps your look dramatic and opens up the shape of your eye at the same time. It adds the perfect amount of playfulness to all looks. Plus it opens up your eye, making it look wider.

Last weekend, 2 - 3 February, I had the pleasure of accompanying 19 people on a journey of discovery to understand and/or confirm God's plan and destiny for their lives!
At this, the launch weekend seminar for Christian Leadership Ministries, we had people from a number of different church denominations, as well as someone who doesn't attend church, all working together in harmony, supporting each other, sharing, giving of themselves, having fun.
For me, the atmosphere was amazing. I witnessed many new friendships being formed and new connections being made. It was like I could actually 'feel' the presence of God with us throughout the whole weekend. Based on comments made and the feedback received, it was an amazing experience for everyone who participated. All in all, it was a God-inspired, confirming and connecting experience. It was wonderful.
So what was so wonderful about it? What did we actually cover over this weekend journey to discover our destiny projects and God's will for our lives?
5 steps that will move us from merely identifying our God-given purpose, to actually being in a position to fulfil it!
By the end of our time together, participants went away with, not only clarity in terms of the ministry they themselves want to get actively involved in, but the also left with a plan of action and their first 3 - 5 steps to move forward with.
I want to say a special "Thank you" to EVERYONE who was involved in making the weekend possible: to the Lord, for His guidance and vision; special thanks to Ann, Dave and all the staff at Purley Chase, who provided "home from home" hospitality to us; to all those who came along and took such an active part; and to everyone who has helped me in ensuring that this weekend was such a success.

Transradial access (TRA) is considered the standard in many parts of the world but in the United States, adoption has been slower. That said, the percentage of procedures that are performed radially in the US has increased steadily over the last decade, reaching approximately 30% in current practice.

Washington: Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg set a new record for corporate compensation in 2012 with a package worth more than $2.278 billion, according to a survey by a corporate governance firm.
The report by GMI Ratings showed Zuckerberg\'s salary of $503,000 and bonus of $266,000 were eclipsed by stock options worth some $2.27 billion.
This was the first year the survey found any chief executive collected more than $1 billion, according to the GMI report released yesterday.
One other CEO\'s compensation also topped $1 billion in 2012, energy giant Kinder Morgan\'s Richard Kinder, paid a salary of $1 and given stock worth over $1.1 billion.
Those two overshadowed other CEOs, with the third-highest paid being Sirius XM Radio\'s Mel Karmazin at $255 million, followed by Liberty Media\'s Gregory Maffei ($254 million) and Apple\'s Tim Cook ($143 million).
Maffei also collected $136 million for his role of CEO at Liberty Interactive Corp, the seventh highest on the list. Putting those two together would make him the third highest-paid with $390 million.
In the survey of 2,259 North American publicly traded companies, GMI said pay increased a median of 8.47 per cent.
For the companies in the Standard and Poor\'s 500 index, compensation rose 19.65 per cent at the median.
\"In the more than ten years that GMI has been publishing this report, I\'ve never seen a top ten highest paid list that loomed this large,\" said Greg Ruel, report\'s author.
\"While the companies in this year\'s list have performed well over the past three and five year periods in terms of shareholder return, generally speaking, it\'s the sheer size and volume of equity awards granted to these top executives that catapults their total compensation to astronomical levels.\"
The massive compensation packages are generally due to stock awards, often in the form of options which allow a CEO to buy shares at a fixed price and cash in on gains.
GMI said Zuckerberg exercised 60 million stock options, granted in 2005 and fully vested by 2010, at a strike price of just six cents.
When Facebook went public in May 2012, Zuckerberg\'s worth vaulted by more than $2.7 billion dollars on the difference.
\"Lest anyone think these are merely paper profits, readers may recall that Mr Zuckerberg immediately liquidated more than $1 billion worth of shares at the company\'s IPO,\" the GMI report said.
\"The second largest form of compensation for Mr Zuckerberg was perquisites totaling about $1.2 million, including personal use of company aircraft during 2012 for him and guests as well as security costs.\"
In addition to the cases where call() is useful, this method allows you to create an arbitrary number of parameters to pass to the function via code. The following (contrived) example takes input from the user as long as it's not an empty string, and then calls a function which processes the arbitrary number of arguments passed to it.
The above sample code assumes a function called GetUserInput, which would be implementation-specific. To help illustrate the how the above would work, consider the following example:
On the 28th of August the numerous visitors of Russian Cultural Center in Tel Aviv became the guests of a special occasion that opened a new season at RCC.
RCC director, Dr. A.A. Krjukov warmly welcomed the guests, both old and new visitors, told about RCC plans and informed that Russian International Center Agency in Israel created its own cite.
The event symbolizing the beginning of RCC activity was literary-musical evening devoted to the memory of Russian-Israeli journalist and poet Vladimir Dobin (1946- 2005). Vladimir Dobin became famous in literary circles still during the years of his work in Moscow (he was an executive secretary of newspapers "Moscovsky Komsomolets", "Sovershenno Sekretno", published his poems in "Ujnost" and in "Literaturnaya Gazeta"). Coming to Israel V. Dobin became a prominent personality in Israeli literary and journalistic circles.
"I'm Russian poet, because I exist in Russian culture", - Dobin said about himself. Vladimir Dobin had published six books of poetry and the scores of profound analytical and publicistic articles in Israeli newspapers and magazines in Russian language.
Among our honored guests who came to commemorate their friend's and colleague's memory were a famous Russian and Israeli writer Anatoly Aleksin, the Chairman of Russian Speaking Writers' Union Efraem Bauch, its Executive Secretary Leonid Finkel, Zakhar Gelman, "Russian Newspaper" Own Correspondent in Israel, and other prominent Israeli men of letters, journalists, painters, musicians and public figures.
A violinist Galina Glushkina, an Azerbaijani people's actress Dina Tumarkina, who brilliantly recited Dobin's poems, the singer Olga Umansky, who sang the songs on his poems with guitar accompaniment, performed before the audience.
Galina Malamant – a journalist from "Week News" (Tel-Aviv) conducted the evening. Dobin had been working for several years for this newspaper.
Happy Monday morning to you! I am usually not a morning person…or a Monday person…lol…but today is an exception. I received a lovely e-mail from my friend, Cathy McCauley, a few weeks ago, asking me to participate in the Creative Blog Hop that is circulating around the net. I am so very honored that Cathy nominated me as someone that she is inspired by! Here is my dear friend Cathy…
Cathy is such a sweet lady whom I’ve had the pleasure of meeting a few times in real life. I love the fact that she is very open with her faith and encouraging to others. We work together on the Sweet ‘n Sassy design team and Cathy is a big help to Korin with her business. Cathy also designs for Our Daily Bread. Cathy loves Golden Retrievers, hence her blog name Golden Inkspirations. She is known as cathymac on Splitcoaststampers where she is a Dirty Dozen Alumni and very active in the gallery and forums. Cathy’s projects are very inspiring! She tries new techniques and adds various details and stitching to her cards to create the most perfectly finished look. You can read more about Cathy here in her blog post for the Creative Blog Hop.
The past several months I have been working on projects for my daughter’s wedding (loving every minute of it!) and trying to keep up with design team work. Now that the wedding is over, I will be focusing more time back on my design team work and some stamping “just for fun”. With Halloween around the corner, I am participating in an ATC swap with some local friends in which I just finished 2 different Halloween ATCs with special cuts and folds. I’ll share those in the upcoming weeks but here’s a sneak peek.
I am also looking forward to designing some new stamp sets. You can find my Sweet ‘n Sassy stamps here.
I really don’t think my work is “different” since I love to create in all types of styles…multi layers, CAS, trying various techniques…whatever I am in the mood for. When life gets busy (like the past year) I tend to go CAS (clean & simple). I am looking forward to adding the layers back in now. I am easily bored so I always love to change things up and learn something new. I signed up for the Watercolor class online but haven’t had time to start yet so I am looking forward to dabbling in that! I also love to push my brain a bit and create my own tutorials and templates. I love creating 3-D projects as well as cards.
One reason why I create is to escape the everyday stress that life throws your way. But I guess my creative mind goes way back. I have been a “crafty” person for as long as I can remember. I enjoyed various crafts as a child and young teen…including painting ceramics and making macramé plant holders. Remember those?
I’ve always wished that I paid more attention to my grandmother when she tried to teach me to knit and crochet. As a young mother I started sewing and even made tiny Barbie clothes. Later on in life, as a wife, mother, and part-time worker outside of the home, stamping became the perfect fit for me and my busier life. It allows me to create and see a finished product in a short amount of time. It also allows me to share what I create with others. I love knowing that my cards or small gifts have brightened someone’s day. We can all use a little extra sunshine, don’t you think?
Most times I am creating for my design team work so my projects start with those products…using stamps or dies by Sweet ‘n Sassy (love, love, love these) or using the Scor-Pal and Scor-Tape (awesome stuff!) to create 3-D or creatively scored projects. I find inspiration everywhere and anywhere. This card I recently shared was inspired by a blouse in a clothing store. Occasionally I play along with some SCS challenges which are great for jump-starting your creativity. I doodled this card for a challenge one time and later the drawing was turned into a stamp. You can find that stamp set here. I also love trying new techniques or card shapes and folds. I like using different styles of stamps but I tend to lean toward the cute/whimsical images that make me smile. Lately I’ve had a little fun with the Art Impressions people. You can see those cards here. And when I am feeling tired or stressed…I just need to walk away because I know the creative process won’t work at all. lol.
I have put off typing all that until the last minute…LOL. I guess I was afraid I wouldn’t have anything to say! Now for the easy part. I have SO MANY friends that I have met or worked with in real life or on the internet that are SO very inspiring…I am blessed! I could be here for days!
First, I want to give a shout out to someone who was nominated before but I want to mention anyway because she is so inspiring to me…Michele Boyer.
If you haven’t read her Creative Blog Hop post, please RUN and read it here. Michele and I were on the SCS Dirty Dozen together way back in 2005. We don’t have weekly or even monthly contact but the friendship remains. I want to be Michele when I grow up. She is funny, witty, and someone I hope to meet in real life someday. Her cards are Eye Candy. period. I love her perfect choices of paper and fun layouts. And I am envious of how she takes the extra step to finish off the insides of her card to match the outside. I love doing this but rarely take the time. Michele is also awesome with coloring…earning her a spot on the Copic team. Michele. is. fabulous.
Cheryl is just the sweetest, kindest person and I’m lucky to call her my friend. Even though we live a few hours from each other, I have been fortunate to stamp with Cheryl a few times. I wish/hope that I get to spend more time with her. Cheryl has designed gorgeous cards for Magnolia-licious, Whipper Snapper, and Mo’s Digital Pencil to name a few. She is currently designing for the “Just Us Girls” challenge blog. Cheryl’s coloring is fabulous and her cards are very cheery and eye-catching! (I am very lucky to have a few!) Please visit her blog, Cottage Creations, to see her wonderful work!
Thanks so much to Cathy for nominating me as one who inspires her and be sure to check out Cheryl’s blog next Monday as she shares a little about herself!
I had an awesome time this weekend with 80+ stampin’ friends at the Spring Fest event in Buffalo, NY! It is always so much fun to meet up with these ladies… some of them I only get to see this one time out of the year. After months of planning, the weekend always flies by too quickly! The only thing I’ve unpacked so far is my camera, so here’s a few photos of the day…
Fab table favors made by Beth (who seems to have escaped all my photos). Perfect for our Wizard of Oz / Over the Rainbow theme!
Some ladies brought a dish to share and Laura Albertson made these CUTE-AS-CAN-BE olive penguins! They were really yummy too!
What a fun day!!! After all of the clean-up, everyone shopped at the best stamp store ever…Buffalo Stamps & Stuff. Then we went out for a yummy, relaxing dinner. Here’s our annual shot before we say goodbye…a few left and missed the photo. Cheryl, Lisa, me, Michele, Tracy, Jeannette.
I recently received a few Ultra-fine Nibs that attach to the Promarkers and was asked to try them out. I thought the best way to share this with you was to take a few pics so you can get a visual of what they are like.
Promarkers are often compared to Copics so I thought I’d include those as well, showing the thickness of the lines in each.
The top 2 markers are Copic Ciao and Copic Sketch…they have a brush tip and a chisel tip. The Promarker (bottom) has a bullet tip and a chisel tip. The Promarker bullet tip gives a slightly thinner line than the Copic brush. The chisel tips are very comparable as well, but the Promarker chisel tip is slightly wider. I like both products and honestly, it took a bit of practice to get used to a different tip. But after a few tries, I really started to feel comfortable with the bullet tip and I like the “feel” of how the ink flows in the Promarker.
The Ultra-fine Nib definitely gives a thinner line! It is very easy to use…just snap it on over the bullet tip and within seconds the ink is flowing. Very cool idea! I took one more pic so you can see how easy it is to color tiny spaces with the Ultra-fine Nibs…
Do you love your Scor-Pal as much as I do? I use mine on every card! And now Diana Crick, the creator of the Scor-Pal made it even better!
*a reference point at 6″ on the bottom! (Sorry you can’t see it in this pic…I wanted to get a close-up of the numbers across the top)
I hope I didn’t miss anything. I am gonna love those 1/4″ grooves! Personally, I am glad that it doesn’t have grooves every 1/8″ across the board like the “other” scoring board. I tried one a few weeks ago and I found it very confusing and hard on my eyes to find the groove that I needed. The scoring tool also kept wanting to jump the track I was in, but that may have been user error. 😉
Keep your eyes peeled on the Scor-Pal website…they should have full inventory of these in a few weeks! I received this one now because I am on the new Scor-Pal design team! I can’t wait to play with it! ♥
Please check out my new “Sale” page by clicking here or on the tab at the top of this page. I am going to try putting a few of my cards up to help aid my friend, Michelle Oatman.
In our efforts to support our dear friend, Michelle Oatman, Tina Wenke and Stampavie have worked together to provide the *cutest* little donkey image as a digital download.
Please visit the Stampavie DT blog to find out how you can download this sweet image. In return, Stampavie simply asks that you donate $3 or more to Michelle’s PayPal fund. Thanks for your support!
We at Stampavie would very much appreciate if you would join us in supporting our US Representative, Design Team member and dear friend, Michelle Oatman.
On Wednesday evening, June 23, Michelle had an accident while tending her beloved donkeys which has left her blind in her right eye. She has shared the news of her accident in her blog post here (http://donkeysmiles.blogspot.com/2010/06/i-will-be-out-for-awhile-i-have-had.html) Michelle is an amazing stamper and is eager to be able to start crafting again. But she also has a lot of healing that needs to occur and she needs our support.
We at Stampavie want to help her on her road to recovery. While we all would like nothing more than to support her in person, some things are just not possible. So besides sending cyber-hugs, we are asking for PayPal donations which will be sent directly to Michelle to help “kick” the mounting medical costs associated with her surgeries and also to help her obtain an artificial eye.
To show your support for Michelle, please, please log into your PayPal account and make your donation payment, no matter how small, to the account info@stampavie.com.
Tina Wenke is also kindly working on a digital download (of a donkey, of course!) so please check back here or on the Stampavie DT blog for more details on that. You’ll be able to download it directly from our DT blog, all we ask in return is that you donate $3 to Michelle’s PayPal fund.
Michelle is a very loving and caring person and we are all lucky to call her “friend”! Michelle says that she is lucky to be married to her best friend. Together, they are parents to their 2 Toy Australian Shepherds, a cat, and their Miniature Donkeys that they raise. The love she gives her animals comes right back, as they keep her busy, entertained and happy. Now, we hope that the love she sends out to the stamping community and beyond will come back as well! Thanks for your help!
Today is the sneak preview of my new set, Special Day, at All That Scraps! And if you scroll past my sample, I have a pic from a very special day this past weekend! It was sooo much fun!
My sneak preview card here was actually sneaked on Saturday, a little early, at the 3rd Annual WNY Spring Fest in Buffalo, NY. This was my shoebox project for the ladies at my tables to make. Tracy had the best idea this year to not only hold a shoebox swap in the morning, but in the afternoon as well. With some careful planning, she managed to seat everyone so they didn’t get the same projects twice and we came away with double the fun!
I used two of the images in the set here along with two sentiments (one was on the inside and I forgot to get a pic).
I love the ribbon woven through the punched border…that was a trick I saw on my friend Cheryl’s blog. Thanks, Cheryl!
You can check out the other samples made with this set on the ATS blog. And check back each day for new sneak peeks!
And here’s another pic from our special day on Saturday. This was taken after the day’s big event was over and after clean-up, shopping at the fab Buffalo stamp store, and our dinner out at My Tomato Pie. We were pretty tired but look how happy we are! I actually lifted this pic from Tracy’s blog since my pics are still unpacked, but I figure since she copied it from my camera, it’s all good. lol!
This is only a few of the ladies who attended (there were almost 100 from NY, PA and Canada!) and I think each of us in this pic attended every year so far.
This is Melissa (Tracy’s SIL), Tracy (our fab hostess), Lisa, Michele, Cheryl, me, and Karen. What fun ladies to spend the weekend with! More of our friends were still inside eating…I wish I had taken more pics at the event. sigh. Tracy and I are wearing the cutest shirts she made for the helpers so they could easily be spotted for anyone who needed help. She thinks of everything!
shhh….don’t tell him but I haven’t actually tried this recipe yet. It was the only one I found that included strawberry jam. LOL! But it does sound yummy, doesn’t it? he he. Let me know how it is if you try it out! ;0)
Sorry I am so late getting this post up! SCS is having an issue with their blogs and I am unable to post any photos. :0( I’m sure they will get it fixed soon, but in the meantime you can check out the previews for my new set, Valentine Critters on the ATS blog. And while you are there, post a comment to enter for a chance to win it! All of the sets will be available on Monday at All That Scraps . I’ll be back later with a pic here and more info.

i adore modern classics — favorite, even vintage elements cleverly updated with unexpected colors and fresh clean lines. i also adore how quality {with a dash of opulence} makes a statement like nothing else can. so my approach to design is simple — chic, modern, luxe.
we love to share unique ideas, exciting news, fabulous finds, and beautiful images from our own collections and from the wonderful artists we know and discover.
we strive to always give proper credit, but if we have shared something you would prefer us to change or remove, just contact us and we'll handle right away!
also, we don't accept favors or payments in exchange for blog coverage or advertising — every business and/or service featured on the paper olive blog is here strictly because we love it.
i first got the big idea for an invitation design company a year ago, when the knot magazine decided to publish a photo of the ceremony programs i designed for my wedding, which had been submitted by my photographer, god love him. i had been mulling around the idea of making a go as a designer when bam, the phone rang. the knot. quite serendipitously, they wanted to publish my program photo in their 2008 best of weddings issue and they needed the designer's name. "paper olive!" i exclaimed, in astonishment.
so, here i am a year later with a website, a slew of wedding invitations and designs, paper cuts and ink-stained fingers, a mad obsession with dupioni silk and embroidered vinyl, and a thousand other crazy ideas that won't let me sleep at night. i'm a designer now, committed and determined, and loving every opportunity to do something drastically new.
a blog seemed like a good idea, especially since my invitation designs are pulled anywhere from runway fashion to the food i eat, as well as everthing in between. i come across some seriously cool stuff in my endless adventures to push the envelope (no pun intended), so i might as well share, yes?
for my first blog post, it seems fitting to highlight my first bridal show, held at the famous queen mary hotel in long beach, california. it was a whirlwind and utterly exhausting, but it was also a blast.
i've included some of the glorious pictures supplied by art p suwansang, whose booth was right next to mine. art is a friendly, really talented photographer. you might want to give him a look if you're in the market. thanks again, art.
by far, the most popular invitation at the show was my peacock invitation, which i put together after a late-night project runway marathon. i can't even remember what season it was, but there were feathers, heidi looked sensational, and someone was crying. isn't someone always crying?
anyway, inspired by color and lack of sleep, i pulled this one together in just a day, specifically for the expo. i can't wait for someone to order it so i can make more. i think it might be my favorite.
it's been a lot of fun watching the additional flurry of traffic on my site since the show, which is still amazing to me. i am thrilled to see so many brides out there who think outside the box. each new client surprises me. i love it.
i have another show coming up on november 16, at the pasadena hilton, and i'm looking forward to seeing the response from that set of brides. i think i'm going to have to whip something up to beat my peacock invite, which shouldn't be tough with the incredible red silk i just found.

The first things you will notice about the Blue Mo-Fi Headphones is how LOUD they can be. The headphones have internal batteries that require no maintenance. The only thing they require is charge should you desire to use the amplied modes. The headphones have three settings: OFF, ON, ON+. OFF is what a normal person will use or what you will want to use most of the time if you’re not doing anything intense. This mode is still pretty loud compared to other headphones and it’s fine for everyday use.

Remember what I was saying the other day about good music videos not having to be expensive music videos? Well here's the most compelling proof you could hope to find.
Discovered via last week's b3ta.com newsletter, this is the best video I've seen this millennium - no exaggeration.
The whole thing took four directors - Masashi Kawamura, Hal Kirkland, Magico Nakamura, Masayoshi Nakamura (two of whom work for the BBH creative agency in New York) - and 64 fans, filming themselves on their webcams in a number of bedrooms around the world.
The song is called Hibi no Neiro (Tone of everyday) and it's by a Japanese band called Sour. Check out their website here.
How frustrating! You finally find the torrent you’ve been dying to download, but the download is taking hours, or even days. Isn’t there a better way? Yes! There is a better way. There are some tweaks and sneaks to help you get faster uTorrent downloads. Read below to find out more.
There are other options for downloading torrents, audiobook torrents and tv torrents. Find them out!
Seeders are those who have already downloaded the torrent and are now in the process of allowing others to download it. Peers are those who are still downloading the torrent. Peers can share the torrents too, but are only able to share what they have finished downloading.
When you add new trackers, it will add new seeds and peers. This can mean faster download speeds. Since the trackers close frequently and change a lot, adding new open trackers is critical for getting the best download speeds.
To do this, open the torrent with uTorrent. Begin the download, checking to see the speed under the tab called “Down Speed”. Right click on the name of the download, then select “Properties”. Find “Trackers” and paste the trackers you can copy off here. Choose “OK”. Soon, additional seeders and peers will show up, and your download speed could increase when that happens.
When you are downloading multiple torrents at the same time, you can allot more bandwidth to the one that you want to finish faster. Simply right click on the file that you want to download the fastest. Hover the mouse pointer over the selection “Bandwidth Allocation.”
On the side menu, choose the option, “High”. Now, go through this process with the other torrents that are downloading, only set those to “Low” instead of “High”.
You can also increase uTorrent download speeds by using the bandwidth settings. In order to do this, choose the selection named “Options”. Click on “Preferences”. Then find the tab marked “Bandwidth”. Use these parameters:
The seeder’s firewall settings can often inhibit the seeding process, meaning you aren’t getting any download data on some seeders. It isn’t necessary to reconfigure the seeder’s firewall settings, however. What you can do instead is to allow your uTorrent client to receive the data directly with no firewalls to interfere.
To set this up, choose the selection marked “Options” and then choose “Preferences”. Go to the option marked “Connections” and check to see that the option “Enable UPnP Port Mapping” is checked. This option allows you to avoid the firewall and connect directly with the seeder, speeding up the download process.
Of course, your Internet speed is also a contributing factor to how quickly you are able to download torrent files. If your speeds are really slow, talk to your Internet provider about a faster service package.

It’s rare when you have an establishment that is an “all-in-one” destination. A place that’s great for business lunches, dinners with friends, watching sporting events, and providing a decent nightlife. Arizona Bar and Grill in Etobicoke is that place.
Arizona Bar and Grill, located at 15 Carlingview Drive, is a favourite hangout for those travelling to or from Pearson Airport. It is also relatively close to various office towers in the area which means it’s not uncommon to see people in business attire discussing office politics over lunch (
Arizona Bar and Grill also offers free wireless internet). The space is pretty impressive with a huge main bar, a dining area, and four private rooms. Speaking of food, with over 70 menu items it’ll be hard to find something you won’t like. Oh, and you’ll want to take advantage of 1/2 price appetizers Monday to Friday (3:30 pm to 6:30pm) and on weekends (5:00pm to 9:00pm). However, I think where Arizona’s really shines is on the weekends.
Friday and Saturday nights are busy and loud and that’s a good thing. It’s quite the atmosphere where groups of friends, people on dates, and singles are all having a great time eating, hanging by the bar, and playing pool (which is free of charge). They also have a dance floor for all the dancers out there. Recently, we were trying to find a place to watch the UFC in Etobicoke and Arizona’s came to mind. The place was packed so you’ll want to show up early on these nights. The crowd varies in age but to my eyes everyone there was having an awesome time.
Arizona B-Bar and Grill isn’t your typical bar or your typical grill for that matter. It’s the total package!

Toronto is sometimes described as a "city of neighbourhoods." It seems an odd description, since nearly all cities contain neighbourhoods, but it is intended to imply that Toronto’s neighbourhoods are especially varied and distinctive. However, neighbourhoods are not fixed entities. Although some neighbourhoods change very little in their physical, social, and demographic composition over time, others may change significantly in the course of a few years.
This report provides a new way of looking at Toronto’s neighbourhoods. It focuses on who lives where, based on the socio-economic status of the residents in each neighbourhood, and how the average status of the residents in each neighbourhood has changed over a 35-year period. It shows that Toronto’s neighbourhoods fall into one of three categories — creating three distinct Torontos.
Why is this important? Cities have always had pockets of wealth and poverty. Neighbourhoods in the great cities of the industrialized world have undergone many transitions over the course of their history. However, the City of Toronto’s neighbourhood transition has been relatively sudden and dramatic, and the changes have serious consequences for Toronto residents.
The first, which we call City #1, is a predominantly high-income area of the City of Toronto in which neighbourhood incomes have risen a great deal relative to the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA) average since 1970; these neighbourhoods are generally found in the central city and close to the city’s subway lines. By contrast, City #3 is a generally low-income area of Toronto, in which neighbourhood incomes have fallen substantially over the past few decades compared to the CMA average; these neighbourhoods are found mostly in the northeastern and northwestern parts of Toronto. In between these two is City #2, a mainly middle-income area, where neighbourhood incomes have remained fairly close to the CMA average since 1970. While all cities can be divided into various groupings, the important finding in this research is the consistent trend over time: the three groups of neighbourhoods are changing at different rates and moving further apart.
The middle-income area of the city shrank dramatically between 1970 and 2005, while the highincome area increased slightly and the low-income area increased substantially.
Based on comparisons of neighbourhood income with the CMA average, the proportion of middleincome neighbourhoods (incomes less than 20% above or below the CMA average in each year) was 66% in 1970, but only 29% in 2005. Meanwhile, over the same period, high-income neighbourhoods (neighbourhood incomes 20% or more above the CMA average) grew from 15% of the city’s neighbourhoods to 19% and low-income neighbourhoods (neighbourhood incomes 20% or more below the CMA average) grew from 19% of the city’s neighbourhoods to 53% (extremely low-income neighbourhoods grew from 1% to 9%). Middle-income households have not simply moved to suburban municipalities beyond Toronto, because a similar trend can be seen in the rest of the Toronto CMA.
In the 1970s, most of the city’s low-income neighbourhoods were in the inner city. This meant that low-income households had good access to transit and services. Some of these neighbourhoods have gentrified and are now home to affluent households, while low-income households are concentrated in the northeastern and northwestern parts of the city (the inner suburbs), with relatively poor access to transit and services.
The study looked at trends for a 35-year period, and found most of the changes to be persistent. The polarization of the city into wealthy neighbourhoods and greater numbers of disadvantaged neighbourhoods is continuing and middle-income neighbourhoods are disappearing.
These trends could be slowed or reversed by public policies that would make housing more affordable to low-income households, by efforts to expand access to transit and services in neighbourhoods where the need is greatest, and by renewing the aging high-rise neighbourhoods scattered throughout City #3 (e.g., by the Tower Neighbourhood Renewal initiative: www.TowerRenewal.ca).
Neighbourhoods are complex blends of physical, social, and psychological attributes. Each neighbourhood provides different access to physical infrastructure and social and community services. Each has its own history. Each is the outcome of an ongoing process of collective action involving various social, political, and economic forces, both internal and external. These processes lead to neighbourhood change.
The price of housing is a key determinant of neighbourhood stability or change in societies where the real estate market largely governs access to housing. Higher-income households can always outbid lower-income households for housing quality and preferred locations. If a lower-income neighbourhood has characteristics that a higher-income group finds desirable, gentrification occurs and the original residents are displaced. The opposite also occurs. Some neighbourhoods, once popular among middle- or higher income households, fall out of favour and property values fail to keep up with other neighbourhoods. Over time, lower-income households replace middle- and higher-income households.
All these processes can be observed in the “city of neighbourhoods.” Rapid growth and a culturally diverse population have affected not only Toronto’s performance in national and world arenas, but also its neighbourhoods. In the 35 years between 1970 and 2005, the incomes of individuals have fluctuated, owing to changes in the economy, in the nature of employment (more part-time and temporary jobs), and in government taxes and income transfers. These changes have resulted in a growing gap in income and wealth and greater polarization among Toronto’s neighbourhoods.
There is no one way to draw boundaries that define specific neighbourhoods. Defining a neighbourhood is, in the end, a subjective process. Neighbourhoods encompass each resident’s sense of community life. There is no doubt, however, about the importance of neighbourhoods and their effects on health, educational outcomes, and overall well-being.
For statistical reporting and research purposes, Statistics Canada defines “neighbourhood-like” local areas called census tracts. In defining census tracts, Statistics Canada uses recognizable physical boundaries (such as roads, railway lines, or rivers) to define compact shapes, within which can be found a more or less homogeneous population
in terms of socio-economic characteristics. The population of a census tract is generally 2,500 to 8,000. The City of Toronto encompasses 531 census tracts (as of the 2006 Census). Each has an average population of about 4,700 people. “Census tract” is used here interchangeably with the term “neighbourhood.”
In this study, our definition of a “neighbourhood” differs from that of the City of Toronto, which has defined and named only 140 neighbourhoods. Each represents a group of census tracts — on average, 3.8 census tracts and about 17,900 people. The city’s definition of neighbourhoods helps define and provide names for districts within the city, but they are too large to represent the lived experience of a neighbourhood. Individual census tracts come closer to that experience, even though they are statistical artifacts and do not always capture the true notion of neighbourhood.
Neighbourhood Change > The Three Cities Home > Neighbourhood Polarization since 1970: Three distinct cities emerge in Toronto
The City of Toronto is huge: 632 square kilometres (244 square miles). With more than 2.5 million people living in its residential areas, a 20% increase since the early 1970s, the nature of its neighbourhoods has changed over time to reflect significant changes in the demographic characteristics and economic situation of their residents. Thirty-five years is an adequate period to examine the nature of change in neighbourhood characteristics and to identify trends.
Many of the questions asked in the 1971 census are still used in current census forms; therefore it is possible to analyse many aspects of neighbourhood change since that time. Thanks to a research grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, a data analysis team at the University of Toronto’s Cities Centre (formerly the Centre for Urban and Community Studies) organized census data at the census-tract level for the Toronto CMA between 1971 and 2006. To avoid confusion with dates, note that incomes reported in the 1971 and 2006 censuses represent those of the preceding calendar years (1970 and 2005).
Over the course of 35 years, the pattern of who lives where in Toronto on the basis of socio-economic characteristics has changed dramatically. There has been a sharp consolidation of three distinct groupings of neighbourhoods in the city. No matter what important indicator of socio-economic status is used, the results are very similar. In this report we use the starting point in any study of the socio-economic status of individuals — individual income.
Using the 2001 census tract geography, we started by comparing the average individual income of people 15 years and older in each census tract in 1970 with the average individual income of people 15 years and older in the same census tracts in 2005 (see Map 1 and Table 1 and the note on methods at the end of this report for definitions). To control for inflation between the two years, we divided the average census tract income by the average income of the entire Toronto census metropolitan area (CMA) thereby obtaining a ratio for each year, 1970 and 2005. We did this for every census tract for 1970 and 2005 (as reported in the 1971 and 2006 censuses). Finally, we calculated the percentage increase or decrease in the two ratios.
Three categories are shown in Map 1: (1) in City #1 individual incomes increased by 20% or more; (2) in City #2 incomes increased or decreased by less than 20%, and (3) in City #3 incomes decreased by 20% or more.
(The note on methods at the end of this chapter indicates why we used average individual income instead of other income measures, why we used 2001 census tract boundaries for mapping, how we reconciled changes in the number and spatial definition of tracts over time, how we compared census tract changes over time, and what categories were used to map the percentage increase or decrease in the two ratios.)
Map 1 shows that, instead of a random pattern of neighbourhood change, Toronto’s neighbourhoods have begun to consolidate into three geographic groupings.
Neighbourhoods within which average individual incomes compared to the Toronto CMA average individual income increased by 20% or more between 1970 and 2005, that is, City #1, are shown in blue on Map 1. These neighbourhoods represent 19% of the city (100 census tracts, census 2001 boundaries) and are generally located near the centre of the city and close to the city’s two subway lines. This area includes some of the waterfront, much of the area south of Bloor Street and Danforth Avenue (where gentrification is taking place), and in central Etobicoke,
The neighbourhoods that have changed very little, that is, in which the average income of individuals 15 years and over compared to the Toronto CMA average went up or down by less than 20%, have been left white on Map 1. This is City #2.
This area represents 39% of the city (208 of the 527 census tracts with census 2001 boundaries). For the most part, this group of neighbourhoods is in the middle, located between the other two groups of neighbourhoods.
Neighbourhoods within which average individual incomes decreased by 20% or more between 1970 and 2005 relative to the Toronto average individual income are shown as solid brown on Map 1. This is City #3. These neighbourhoods comprise about 39% of the city’s neighbourhoods (209 census tracts). They are mainly located in the northeast and northwest parts of the city outside the central corridor along Yonge Street and the Yonge Street subway.
The trends shown on Map 1 are both surprising and disturbing. Surprising, because 35 years is not a long time. Disturbing, because of the clear concentration of wealth and poverty that is emerging.
In the following section, we use individual maps for 1970 and 2005 (Maps 2 and 3), rather than the summary index of change in Map 1, to further explore the decline in “middleincome” neighbourhoods and the increase in “lower- and higher-income” areas.
Neighbourhood Change > The Three Cities Home > How have the three groups of neighbourhoods changed?
Maps 2 and 3 provide the same data used in Map 1 but for two specific years, 1970 and 2005, rather than the summary 35-year trend.
The maps for each specific year indicate in light yellow neighbourhoods that were “middle income,” that is, defined as having an average individual income less than 20% above or below the Toronto CMA average for that year. In 1970 (Map 2), average individual incomes in 66% of the city’s census tracts (341 census tracts), were close to the average income for the Toronto area.
By 2005 (Map 3) the proportion of middle-income neighbourhoods had fallen to 29% of the city’s census tracts (152 census tracts). Meanwhile, the proportion of low- and very lowincome neighbourhoods increased from 19% to 53%, and the proportion of high- and very high-income neighbourhoods increased from 15% to 19%.
Maps 1, 2, and 3 indicate the location of the neighbourhoods in particular income groups. Figure 1 provides a 1970 to 2005 summary of the change in the number of neighbourhoods in each income group, together with a straight-line projection to the year 2025. The projection assumes the current trends continue.
In Figure 1 we see what has happened to Toronto’s middleincome neighbourhoods — those with average incomes within 20% above or below the CMA average. There has been a 56% drop in the proportion of neighbourhoods with middle incomes between 1970 and 2005 (shown as the middle group of bars, which dropped from 66% to 29%). Most of this loss in the middle group can be accounted for by increases in the number of low-income and very low-income neighbourhoods, which increased from 19% of the city to 53% of the city over the 35-year period.
The poorest and wealthiest neighbourhoods have something in common: both were more numerous in 2005 than in 1970. The poorest category in Figure 1 — those with average incomes of less than 60% of the CMA average — increased from 1% to 9% of the city’s neighbourhoods. Similarly, the mirror opposite eighbourhoods — those with incomes greater than 40% of the CMA average — increased, from 7% of the city to 15%.
In short, the City of Toronto, over a 35-year period, ceased to be a city with a majority of neighbourhoods (66%) in which residents’ average incomes were near the middle and very few neighbourhoods (1%) had very poor residents. Middle-income neighbourhoods are now a minority and half of the city’s neighbourhoods are low-income when compared with the Toronto CMA average.
Neighbourhood Change > The Three Cities Home > Where are Toronto’s middle-income people? Did they move to the suburbs (the “905” region)?
The decline in the number of middle-income neighbourhoods has also occurred in the rest of the CMA, although to a smaller extent. The rest of the CMA includes the suburban municipalities around Toronto, often referred to by their area code as the “905 region.”
Figure 2 shows that in 1970 a vast majority (86%) of the neighbourhoods in the suburbs around the City of Toronto (the rest of the Toronto CMA) were in the middle-income group. As it did within the city, this share fell between 1970 and 2005, but by a smaller amount. As in Toronto, most of these neighbourhoods shifted to the low-income categories (from 0% in 1970 to 21% in 2005); neighbourhoods with higher average incomes also
What this means is that middle-income people in the city have not simply moved to the outer suburbs. Neighbourhoods with incomes near the CMA average are far less numerous in 2005 than in 1970 in both the city and the outer suburbs, although the decline is more pronounced in the city. The overall trends are the same.
Income is only one defining characteristic of the socioeconomic status of individuals and neighbourhoods. The
Population City #1, City #2, and City #3 contain 17%, 38%, and 43%, respectively, of Toronto’s total population (see Table 1). City #3 has had the largest population increase over the 35 years, because many parts of City #3 were underdeveloped in 1970. However, in the five years between 2001 and
2006, the population of City #2 and City #3 declined slightly, while the population of City #1 increased, primarily because of new residential condominium development in the central area of the city.
Households City #1 households are smaller (2.3 persons per household on average), and there are more one-personhouseholds and fewer two-parent families with children than in the other two cities. City #3 has a higher percentage of singleparent families than City #1 (23% versus 14%) and also a higher percentage of children and youth (33% versus 26%). Overall, there has been a citywide 35-year decline in the proportion of children and youth under 25 years old as a percentage of the population, from 43% to 29%.
Housing tenure Renters are found in most areas of the city, but are particularly prevalent in City #3, where they account for almost half of all households. Renter households spend much more of their income on housing than owners do. In City #3, for example, 47% of renters and 32% of owners spent more than 30% of household income on housing in 2006. In City #1, the gap is even wider, with 41% of renters and 21% of owners spending more than 30% of household income on housing. City #2 is between these two, close to the citywide average.
Immigrants In City #1, the percentage of foreign-born people declined from 35% to 28% between 1971 and 2006, whereas in City #3 the number of immigrants increased dramatically over the 35-year period from 31% of the population in 1970 to 61% in 2006. In 2006 City #2 is close to the citywide average of 50%.
Visible minorities City #1 is mainly white (82%) whereas only 34% of City #3’s population is white. City #1 has very few Black, Chinese, or South Asian people, who are disproportionately found in City #3. Only 11% of City #1 compared to 47% of City #3 are Black, Chinese or South Asian. In contrast to City #1 and City #3, City #2 is close to the overall City of Toronto average with respect to visible minority population.
Education In Toronto as a whole, persons in their twenties and beyond were much more likely to have a university education in 2006 than in 1971. This is especially the case for City #1. In 2006, 61% of residents 25 years and over in City #1 had a university certificate, diploma, or degree, compared to 35% and 31% of the same age group in City #2 and City #3, respectively. Consequently, the relatively large number of well-educated people in City #1 are in a much more favourable position than those in City #2 and City #3 to compete for high-paying white-collar jobs.
Employment As in most post-industrial economies, bluecollar employment in The City of Toronto declined substantially between 1971 and 2005, from 28% to 17%. During the same period, white-collar employment increased from 17% to 40% of all occupations. Most of Toronto’s remaining manufacturing
jobs are located in City #3, with a few in City #2. Not surprisingly, the residential population of City #3 is characterized by more blue-collar employees than City #1. The latter has a largely white-collar population, reflecting its relatively high proportion of university-educated residents.
Income Map 1 and Table 1 show 35-year income trends. City #1 not only has the highest average individual income, but income increased by 99% over the 35 years and by 29% between 2000 and 2005. In City #1, 37% of all households had incomes of $100,000 or more, compared to the citywide average
of 18%. In Cities #2 and #3, average household income as a proportion of Toronto CMA income declined between 1970 and 2005, with City #3 declining the most, by 37%. This shift in income reflects both the lower levels of education among residents of City #3 and their lower occupational status. Not only have incomes declined relative to the Toronto CMA in City #3, this area also has the highest proportion of persons in households with incomes below the Low Income Cut-Off (LICO) level.
Travel Residents of City #3, the neighbourhoods with the lowest average income, have to travel farther to find employment, yet they have the poorest access to the Toronto Transit Commission’s subway stations. Only 19 of the system’s 68 subway stations are within or near City #3 neighbourhoods.
Change is a constant in a dynamic city like Toronto. People move in and out of neighbourhoods in the context of everchanging economic, social, and government policy conditions. Are the trends identified here the result of a persistent pattern, or might they be a random result?
The results show that these three relatively consolidated and distinctly different cities within the City of Toronto have emerged, to a large extent, in a persistent manner. Many neighbourhoods have consistently gone up or down in average individual income compared to the CMA average individual income during each census period we studied. That is, there is no evidence that the changes represent temporary fluctuations or aberrations.
In the entire City of Toronto, over the 25 years from 1980 to 2005, for example, only 9% of all census tracts went up in average individual income consistently. Most of these are in City #1, where average incomes in 43% of the City #1 census tracts have been consistently rising for 25 years or more compared to the CMA average (Table 2, line 1).
The same holds true for census tracts in which average incomes are falling. In the City of Toronto, in 25% of all census tracts, average individual income consistently went down relative to the CMA average during each census period; most of these census tracts (115 out of 128) are in City #3 (Table 2, line 2).
The trends in City #2 are less consistent. Only 8% of City #2’s census tracts show a consistent pattern over the last 25 years (Table 2, line 3). Of these, three-quarters have shown a consistent fall in average income in each census period. This suggests that some of the census tracts in City #2 will eventually become part
of City #3. At the same time, some of the increases in incomes and housing prices occurring in City #1 could very well result in spillover gentrification into adjacent, relatively low-income census tracts that are part of City #2, as these areas become more attractive to middle- and upper-income people.
A map showing only census tracts that have persistently gone up or down for 25 years or more (Map 4) looks very similar to Map 1. Our conclusion that the City of Toronto has polarized into three distinct cities is based on these long-term persistent trends.
Neighbourhood Change > The Three Cities Home > What has changed in Toronto between 2001 and 2006? The most recent two censuses
Five years is a relatively short time for large-scale demographic change to take place, even in a city like Toronto that during the post Second World War period has often experienced sudden and dramatic change. Therefore, it is not surprising that most census tracts (89%) remained in the same group between 2001 and 2006 — that is, the “Three Cities” remained largely the same in 2006 as in 2001.
What about the 11% of census tracts that did change from one group to another during this period? The details of the transition are shown in Table 3 and Map 5. Table 3 shows the net result in terms of gains and losses of census tracts in the “Three Cities.” City #2 experienced a net loss of 15 census tracts during
this period and therefore shrank in size. During the same period, City #3 had a net gain of 14 census tracts and increased in size. City #1 achieved a net gain of one census tract, gaining 12 census tracts from City #2 but losing 11 census tracts to City #2. No census tracts jumped from City #1 to City # 3 or vice versa.
As noted in Map 5, 34 census tracts experienced a decrease in average individual income compared to the Toronto CMA, with 11 census tracts shifting from City #1 to City #2 and 23 census tracts from City #2 to City #3. Spatially, the result of the shift from City #2 to City #3 was a further consolidation of census tracts in City #3, especially in central Scarborough and to a lesser extent, northern Etobicoke.
At the opposite extreme, 21 census tracts underwent an increase in average individual income compared to the Toronto CMA, with 12 census tracts being reclassified from City #2 to City #1 and 9 census tracts from City #3 to City #2. The former include areas of emerging gentrification such as Roncesvalles, High Park, and South Riverdale, while the latter are generally at the edge of former City #3.
Although changes in the “Three Cities” maps between 2001 and 2006 are relatively minor, the changes reinforce earlier findings because they represent a decline in the number of middle-income neighbourhoods and an increase in the number of low-income neighbourhoods. Although the overall number of high-income neighbourhoods remained stable over the five years, the results show a continuing trend towards the creation
Neighbourhood Change > The Three Cities Home > “Reading” maps carefully: The location of Toronto’s lower income neighbourhoods
The dramatic increase in the number of lower-income neighbourhoods in Toronto has implications for the provision of many government and community services.
Maps are helpful, but can be misleading if what they depict is not fully understood. Map 6, showing the population density of Toronto’s low-income neighbourhoods, is important for people engaged in the planning, funding, and delivery of social and community services.
To identify the lower-income neighbourhoods in the most recent census, we need to look at Map 3. This map shows the average individual income of each census tract for one year, 2005. It is a map showing high-, middle- and low-income areas of the city. By itself, however, it can be misleading because census tracts are not all the same size geographically, even though the population of each census tract is approximately the same (averaging 4,700 in Toronto).
Map 6 corrects for the mismatch between the different geographic size of census tracts and the fact that census tracts have approximately similar sized populations. It shows only the lower income census tracts on the basis of their population density. Thus, even though most of the neighbourhoods in northeast and northwest Toronto have, on average, low-income populations, much of those areas are lower density — except for the clusters of high-rise residential towers. Areas south of the Danforth and areas west of University Ave. (north and south of Bloor St.) are Toronto’s traditional low-income “inner city” neighbourhoods. They continue to be high-density concentrations of lowerincome people in 2006, even though there is some gentrification occurring in and around those areas.
Map 1 in this report, in contrast, takes two points in time, 1970 and 2005. It maps trends — those neighbourhoods that have been trending upward in average individual income (coloured blue) or trending downward (coloured brown) over those 35 years. This important and dramatic map of trends, however, is not a map of low-income or poverty neighbourhoods. Most but not all of the neighbourhoods trending downward are indeed lower-income. However, many of the neighbourhoods that are not trending up or down (the white areas on Map 1, which is City #2), are low-income (as Maps 3 and 6 indicate).
It must be noted that Map 6 is not a perfect representation of the population density of Toronto’s low-income neighbourhoods. This is because the map is based on gross population densities rather than net densities, or in other words persons per square kilometre of total land area rather than residential land area. Gross population densities are calculated by dividing the population of a census tract by the total land area of that tract, while net densities are determined by dividing the population of the tract by its residential area. The difference in methods can give dramatically different results for census tracts with a considerable amount of non-residential land use (e.g. industrial, commercial, airports, open space, farmland). In that case, net densities will be substantially higher than gross densities. Thus, census tracts in the northeast and northwest of Toronto, which are largely non-residential, exhibit much lower densities in Map 6 than they would if net densities had been used. Unfortunately, land use information by census tract is not readily available, so net densities cannot be easily calculated.
Toronto has changed, and continues to change, in terms of who lives where on the basis of residents’ income and demographic characteristics. Over the 35 years of this study, the gap in incomes between rich and poor grew, real incomes for most people did not increase, more jobs became precarious (insecure, temporary, without benefits), and families living in poverty became more numerous (as the 2007 United Way report Losing Ground documents). These general trends have played themselves out in Toronto’s neighbourhoods to the point at which the city can be viewed as three very different groups of neighbourhoods — or three separate cities. This pattern did not exist before. At the start of the 35 years, most of the neighbouhoods in the city, and more of the people living in the outer suburbs (the “905 region”) were middle-income (that is, they had incomes within 20% above or below the Toronto CMA average). In 1970 a majority of neighbourhoods (66%) in the City of Toronto accommodated residents with average incomes and very few neighbourhoods (1%) had residents with very low incomes (Figure 1 and Map 2). By 2005, only a third of the city’s neighbourhoods (29%) were middle-income, while slightly over half of the city’s neighbourhoods, compared to 19% in 1970, had residents whose incomes were well below the average for the Toronto area (Map 3). It is not the case that middle-income people in the city have simply moved to the outer suburbs (the “905 region”), since the trends are largely the same in those areas too (Figure 2). It is common to say that people “choose” their neighbourhoods, but it’s money that buys choice. An increasing number of people in Toronto have relatively little money and thus fewer choices about where they can live. Those who have money and many choices can outbid those without these resources for the highest-quality housing, the most desirable neighbourhoods, and the best access to services. When most of the population of a city is in the middle-income range, city residents can generally afford what the market has to offer, since they make up the majority in the marketplace and therefore drive prices in the housing market.
In the late 1970s, the Social Planning Council of Metropolitan Toronto (now called Social Planning Toronto) launched a detailed study of change in Toronto’s “inner suburbs” — the suburban areas within the City of Toronto (then Metro Toronto). It was the first research organization to recognize and document the changing nature of the suburban neighbourhoods in the city. The suburbs that were in transition at that time are mainly the areas of the city that are shown in brown on Map 1. That study, titled Metro’s Suburbs in Transition, included this comment:
The post-war suburbs assumed one set of family conditions for child-rearing, and the physical environment incorporated these assumptions. The prototype suburban family — father in the labour force, mother at home full-time, ownership of a ground level home with private open space, two to four children, homogeneous neighbours — is no longer the dominant reality of suburban life in the seventies. It is now an image that belongs to the social history of the post-war period of rapid growth. (p. 236)
It is these postwar suburbs that now form much of City #3 — the concentration of people with incomes well below the area average, an urban landscape that has a 30-year history of abandonment by people who have a choice. The start of this process was already clear by the late 1970s. The 1979 report concludes:
The traditional suburban neighbourhood may remain physically intact, but it is no longer the same social environment as in earlier days. Within it, around it, at the periphery, in local schools, in neighbourhoods nearby, are the visible signs of social transformation. The exceptions have continued to grow. There reaches a stage when the scale of the exceptions can no longer be ignored for established earlier settlers. Nevertheless, we would conclude that the social minorities taken as a whole now constitute the new social majority in Metro’s post-war suburbs. (p. 236)
The shift from a traditional postwar suburban environment in the 1970s resulted largely from the development of high-rise apartment buildings, including many that contained social housing, and the consequent shift in social composition. Many census tracts included two contrasting urban forms — high-rise apartments on the major arterial roads and single-family, more traditional suburban housing on quieter residential streets. Over the ensuing decades, particularly in Scarborough, western North York, and northern Etobicoke, high-rise housing became home to many newly arrived, low-income immigrant families that came to Canada as a result of the shift in immigration policy in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 2005 the City of Toronto and the United Way of Greater Toronto identified 13 “priority neighbourhoods” — areas with extensive poverty and without many social and community services. All 13 are in the “inner suburbs” and were the subject of the 1979 Social Planning Council report. City #3 includes the 13 priority neighbourhoods. Figure 1, PDF Figure 2, PDF
The polarization of the city need not continue. It is not inevitable. The jurisdiction and financial capacity of the federal and provincial governments are sufficient to reverse the trend. A wealthy nation can use its resources to make a difference. Income support programs that keep up with inflation and are based on the cost of living and tax relief for households in the bottom fifth of the income scale can address inequality. Assistance with households’ most expensive budget item — housing — through social housing and rent supplement programs (which exist in most Western nations), will free up more of a household’s meagre monthly income for other essentials.
The provincial and municipal governments could implement specific policies to help maintain and promote mixed neighbourhoods. These include inclusionary zoning, whereby any medium-to-large new residential developments must include 15% or 20% affordable rental units. Also, the Province of Ontario could keep its promise to end vacancy decontrol — the right of landlords to charge whatever they wish for a rental unit
when a tenant moves — and thereby discourage the displacement of low-income residents in gentrifying areas. Implementation of the Transit City plan and the Tower Neighbourhood Renewal initiative are also essential for making City #3 desirable for both its residents and for a broader socioeconomic mix of households.
The segregation of the city by socio-economic status need not continue. It can be slowed and reversed.
Map 1 in this report shows trends in average individual income for Toronto’s neighbourhoods (census tracts) from 1970 to 2005. What happens to the spatial patterns of the “Three Cities” in Map 1 if we project these trends forward in time — say by 20 years, to 2025? Do more neighbourhoods within the City of Toronto show either a downward or upward trend in income relative to the Toronto CMA? Map 7 indicates clearly that this is what would happen under the assumptions outlined below.
Projections are based on certain assumptions about future change. Sometimes these are referred to as “scenarios.” The text in the box shows the assumptions upon which the projection in Map 7 is based. For City #1 (increasing income) and City #3 (decreasing income), it is assumed that no census tracts will
leave either group. The question then becomes: what will happen to census tracts in City #2 during this 20-year period? Three possibilities for City #2 are combined to produce the projection in Map 7.
First, we assume that City #2 census tracts that increased between 5% and 20% in income in the 1970–2005 period will continue to increase relative to the Toronto CMA; they will reach the 20% threshold by 2025, thereby joining City #1. Second, we assume that City #2 census tracts that decreased between 5% and 20% will continue to decrease and reach the 20% threshold, thereby becoming part of City #3. Third, we assume that City #2 census tracts that increased or decreased less than 5% in income between 1970 and 2005 will remain in City #2.
Thus, the number of census tracts in Cities #1 and #3 will increase substantially at the expense of City #2.
How do these trends translate into the projected spatial distribution of the “Three Cities”? In comparing Map 1 and Map 7, we see that both Cities #1 and #3 have expanded dramatically at the expense of City #2. City #3 now includes almost all of Scarborough, the northern fringe of North York, and almost all of Etobicoke north of Eglinton Avenue, as well as large parts of the former municipalities of York and East York. Most of the isolated census tracts that were part of City #2 in 2005 have now joined City #3. These neighbourhoods will increasingly attract newcomers, especially low-income immigrants, who cannot afford housing in the central city or the outer suburbs.
City #1 has grown to cover most census tracts close to the northsouth and east-west subway lines. By 2025, these census tracts will become increasingly desirable areas of the city, attracting higherincome
residents who want good access to downtown Toronto by public transportation and the amenities of a central location. With the exception of a few pockets of social housing or lower-cost private rental high-rise units built in the 1960s, the area south of the east-west subway line is now almost entirely part of City #1. This change will have been brought about by two ongoing trends: (1) the creation of more condominium apartments, either newly constructed or carved out of abandoned industrial space, and (2) the continued gentrification of older, low-rise residential neighbourhoods. Both of these types of residential areas attract a higherincome population.
In the meantime, City #2 has been reduced to a few census tracts, mostly found between Cities #1 and #3. As a result, the “Three Cities” model is approaching a “Two Cities” model, in which neighbourhoods are sharply divided between those in which average individual incomes have increased dramatically over the 1970 to 2025 period and neighbourhoods where the opposite has occurred.
Of course, this is just one scenario based on current trends. It assumes no changes to Cities #1 and #3, and that many census tracts in City #2 will move upwards or downwards to become part of Cities #1 or #3. In other words, it assumes no major policy changes in the next 20 years, especially policies that might lead to a more equal income distribution and a more equitable spatial distribution of an increased supply of affordable housing. This is a reasonable assumption, since neither of these changes is on the immediate horizon.
In any study, questions arise over the methods used and decisions made; we present answers to some of those questions here so that readers can assess the trustworthiness of the findings.
The Canadian census provides data on income in many forms, such as individual, employment, household, and family income, and breaks the data down into different subsets of the population, such as men and women, single parents and two-parent families. We used average rather than median income, because average income is provided by Statistics Canada for the entire 35-year period. In addition, for the purposes of this research, average income is a better measure than median income because it is more sensitive to the presence of very low- or very high-income persons in a census tract.
Individual income is the census category for income from all sources. Employment income includes only the wage income of individuals, and excludes people on pensions or social assistance and people who receive investment income. We used individual income rather than employment income, because it is more comprehensive (including pension, social assistance, investment and employment income) and includes more people (everybody who reports income and not just those with employment income).
When we carried out the analysis using employment income, City #1 and City #2 were slightly larger (23% and 42% of the 514 census tracts with data) and City #3 was smaller (36%) than with individual income.
We also tested the results using household income. In this analysis, City #1 and City #2 were slightly smaller (15% and 39% respectively) and City #3 was larger (46%) than with individual income. This difference is due to the differences in household size between these areas (see Families & Households section in Table 1).
There is, in short, no significant difference in the trends, whether we use employment, household, or ndividual income. All census tracts have some households with a few adults employed and some with only one adult. All census tracts have people who are temporarily unemployed or on social assistance or on low etirement incomes or have investment income in addition to their wages. Employment income tends to show slightly more census tracts near the middle if we use the same five income categories. Household income and individual income show very similar patterns for high and middle incomes. There is a slight difference in the results for low and very low incomes. An analysis by household income shows slightly more very low-income census tracts in 2005, whereas that for individual income shows slightly more low-income census tracts.
There is, therefore, no universal “best way” to measure neighbourhood income change. Furthermore, any factors that might bias the results from any one source of data tend to balance themselves out, given the large population being studied (2.5 million people in the city and an additional 2.6 million in the outer suburbs).
We also used the CMA average income rather than the City average, because the labour and housing markets of the city and its outer suburbs are connected. Many people living in Toronto earn their income from jobs in the suburban municipalities and vice versa. Also, using the CMA average as our benchmark allows us to compare Toronto neighbourhoods with neighbourhoods in the outer suburbs.
The maps in this publication are based on the 2001 census tract geography, the same geography used in Research Bulletin 41 (2007), The Three Cities Within Toronto: Income Polarization among Toronto’s Neighbourhoods, 1970-2000.
As the City of Toronto increased in population, especially in the suburbs, Statistics Canada divided several 1971 tracts into two or more tracts over the years to 2001. This alteration required some operational decisions on how to handle the 1971 income data. For the 1971 census tracts that were subdivided between 1971 and 2001, we assigned the same average income for 1970 to each of these tracts. That is, if a 1971 census tract was subdivided into two tracts by 2001, each of these tracts was assigned the same income for 1971.
For the 2006 analysis, incomes for the few tracts that were subdivided between 2001 and 2006 were averaged and assigned to the appropriate 2001 tract.
This approach introduces a small amount of imprecision to the analysis, particularly in the more recently developed northern parts of the City, but does not affect the overall trends, since most of the City was built up by 1970. The major advantage of our method is the creation of more detailed maps of change patterns, because one-to-one census tract comparisons between 1970 average income and more recent census years are possible. We did not map census tract changes using this method for the “905 region” because much of this area was undeveloped in 1970.
We calculated the extent to which the average individual income of people 15 years and older in each census tract in 1970 and in 2005 was above or below the average individual income for the entire Toronto Census Metropolitan Area (CMA). Specifically, we divided the average income for the census tract by the average Toronto CMA income for each year thereby obtaining a ratio for each year, 1970 and 2005. Finally, for each census tract we calculated the percentage increase or decrease in the two ratios.
We examined the percentage increase or decrease in the 1970 and 2005 income ratios rather than straight dollar-to-dollar comparisons between 1970 and 2000 for two reasons.
First, the cost of living in Toronto has increased over time, making a $10,000 income in 1970, for example, worth much more than $10,000 in 2005.
Second, direct dollar comparisons cannot tell us how far up or down the income ladder a neighbourhood is located and the size of the gap between different income levels. Any income figure is meaningless on its own
We used the average income for the Toronto CMA for an income benchmark because it takes into account the rapid growth in jobs and population in the surrounding outer suburbs — the “905 region” — which now has a slightly larger population than the City. Many people live in the area surrounding the City but earn their income from employers inside the City and vice versa. In other words, the labour market and the housing market are larger than the City of Toronto itself.
For mapping changes in average individual income (Map 1) we divided the percentage increase or decrease in the 1970 and 2005 income ratios into three categories: (1) City #1: an increase of 20% or more, (2) City #2: an increase or decrease of less than 20%, and (3) City #3: a decrease of 20% or more. While these are arbitrary boundaries, we did experiment with finer divisions of the data. Overall, the three-group categorization is a reasonable compromise and a useful public policy tool. In order to explore the trends in City #3, we have also developed a more detailed profile of City #3 as a supplement to this publication.

Toronto’s inner suburbs are home to many poor households, including members of many racialized groups. At the same time, social services in the inner suburbs are few and far between. This study looks at one neighbourhood (Kingston-Galloway/Orton Park) in Scarborough, and its social infrastructure. Social infrastructure is not just the social services or programs available to residents of a neighbourhood, but the area’s resources and relationships, such as spaces for gathering, opportunities for learning, as well as partnerships and networks within and beyond the community level. Social infrastructure exists at the local scale, but relies on public policy, capital investment, and social networks that are not necessarily local. This report draws on the insights of residents, community workers, non-profit agencies and public sector staff who are committed to improving everyday life for people in Toronto’s low income communities.
Vertical Poverty presents new data on the growing concentration of poverty in the City of Toronto and the role that high-rise housing is playing in this trend. The report tracks the continued growth in the spatial concentration of poverty in Toronto neighbourhoods, and in high-rise buildings within neighbourhoods. Its primary focus is on privately-owned buildings in Toronto’s inner suburbs. The geographic concentration of poverty can trigger of wider neighbourhood decline and disinvestment. This can affect the quality of the local businesses, and the condition and upkeep of housing. Understanding the extent to which geographically concentrated poverty and poor housing conditions are linked is critically important for building strong and healthy neighbourhoods in our city.
At their best, neighbourhoods can be inclusive places full of opportunity, activity, and enterprise that respond to the needs of residents. The challenge is to create a Toronto region where integrated, accessible neighbourhoods meet individual needs and aspirations, and realize shared community visions. All members of civil society – community groups, businesses, service agencies and residents – can work together to put in place the key ingredients for strong neighbourhoods including equitable access to an appropriate mix of jobs and appropriate social and physical infrastructure, such as affordable housing, transportation, schools, social services, recreation and open spaces. Responding to this challenge requires, among other things, better leveraging the capacity of civil society to plan, build and participate in communities.
This report presents new data for the City of Toronto showing a clear link between health and income across the city. Those areas of Toronto that have a greater proportion of people living with low income experience greater risk factors for illness, higher rates of disease, and death at an earlier age. Areas with a smaller proportion of low income – areas that are relatively richer – have better health. These differences are referred to as health inequalities. The report also shows that males in the highest income areas were expected to live 4.5 years longer than males in the lowest income areas. The difference for females was 2.0 years.
Inequality concerns persisting and widespread disparities among the resources available for people to sustain themselves and their families in secure and healthy ways, to make adequate provision for their old age, to take advantage of amenities beyond bare subsistence, to participate in political or community affairs, to engage in volunteer activities, and to pursue valued long-term goals such as succeeding in their occupations or developing talents (as for artistic enjoyment and creation or engagement in hobbies or sports). The contrast is a social ideal where, as several po­litical philosophers conceive of it, distribution of resources is sufficient for everyone to have realistic a chance of leading a meaningful, satisfying, or happy life.
Three chains of events that led to the United Way’s neighbourhood focus: socio-political changes in the late 1990s; growing concern for a new deal for solutions; and federal government launch of a pilot project on neighbourhood revitalization. In 2003 the United Way adopted a new strategic plan, Community Matters. It formalized new roles of research, public policy, and community development.
This report provides important new data about family incomes and family poverty in Toronto, Canada’s largest city. It is a story of lost ground – of a significant gap, which has opened up between the financial well being of families with children in Toronto and their regional, provincial and national counterparts. It is also a cautionary tale – one that points to warning signs that large numbers of vulnerable households are falling into serious financial trouble, evidenced by growing applications for eviction, indebtedness, and insolvency numbers. On every dimension of income examined, Toronto families lost ground, falling behind families in the rest of the country: overall family median incomes were lower, as were median incomes for both two-parent and lone-parent families, and overall family poverty rates were higher.
Income disparity between the region’s rich and poor families is widening, and incomes at the low end of the scale have stagnated or fallen. Housing costs continue to rise and gentrification is displacing lower income households from neighbourhoods with established services and infrastructure to serve low-income families. Many neighbourhoods are caught in deepening cycles of decline, marked by increased crime, homeowner flight, and changed commercial activity, including growth in fringe lending businesses. The growth in neighbourhood disadvantage is primarily taking place in the inner suburban neighbourhoods.
Explains how the “priority areas,” now commonly referred to as priority neighbourhoods, were selected (13 out of Toronto’s 140 defined neighbourhoods; minimum population of 7,000 to 10,000). They were defined by grouping income characteristics in combination with analysis of community infrastructure. Community infrastructure includes general services, such as community centres, libraries, schools and health centres, together with services for specific needs, such as children, youth, senior, newcomer, employment and food services.
Community infrastructure is defined as a complex system of facilities, programs, and social networks that aims to improve people’s quality of life. These assets work in tandem to form the foundation of a strong neighbourhood. Municipalities developing ‘strong’ infrastructure will integrate physical and social planning and development and will invest adequately in both. In contrast, ‘weak’ infrastructure will indicate a continuing separation of the physical and social requirements of the city. Thus, for a strong infrastructure to exist in a locality it is critical that there is adequate investment in both physical and social types of infrastructure.
The report provides a review of international, national and local practice in the use of indicator systems at the neighbourhood level. It outlines the final set of domains and indicators chosen for analyzing Toronto’s neighbourhoods. It looks at neighbourhood vitality in Toronto by deploying the tool in 140 Toronto neighbourhoods. The central conclusion of this study is that Toronto is behind comparable cities in terms of developing a neighbourhood indicator system. While there have been some positive and indeed central developments (such as the definition of 140 neighbourhoods thereby establishing the geography for analysis and response), Toronto lags in this area.
Poverty by Postal Code is a study of the spatial concentration of family poverty in the City of Toronto over two decades. The findings are deeply disturbing. In the twenty years prior to 2001, most ‘poor’ families in Toronto lived in mixed-income neighbourhoods. Today, they are far more concentrated in neighbourhoods with high levels of poverty. The increase in the number of higher poverty neighbourhoods in has been rapid. The growing spatial concentration of poverty has impacted certain vulnerable groups much more acutely than others. Falling median incomes, widening income gaps between rich and poor, and rising poverty levels are having a profound effect on the spatial distribution of poverty in Toronto.
The revival of interest in neighbourhoods is part of a re-assertion that ‘place matters’, to the well-being of individuals and to the health and prosperity of the broader community. The major reasons: concern about growing neighbourhood concentrations of poverty and disadvantage and their effects on individuals and the broader community; increasing recognition that cities and urban regions are socially, environmentally, and economically critical to the well-being of individuals, regions and countries; and the ‘discovery’ of social capital and its potential as a building block for social cohesion and to finding local solutions to problems. There are three inter-connected defining characteristics of a “strong neighbourhood”: those related to social relationships (e.g. community involvement, mutual responsibility); those related to ‘place’ (e.g. active street life); and those related to both (e.g. safety). This paper defines strong neighbourhoods as inclusive, vibrant, cohesive, and safe.
This issue of Ideas that Matter provides our readers with a glimpse of a remarkable community in transition. Last year Ideas that Matter was engaged by the Toronto Community Housing Corporation (one of North America’s largest public housing landlords) to convene a broad-based city-wide forum on the ‘revitalization’ process of one of their largest holdings, the community of Regent Park.
The era of suburban and metropolitan innocence in Toronto is over. The social development patterns reviewed in this report suggest that important social transformations have taken place in the post-war suburbs of Metro. This background report consists of review and analysis, providing a more comprehensive framework for understanding important trends and patterns in the social development of Metro’s newer suburbs. It introduces a set of issues and concerns. The newer suburbs now contain 50% of all inner city students in Metro’s schools, most of Metro’s families with both parents in the labour force, high numbers of single parent families, significant groups of unemployed and alienated youth, and a multitude of cultures and races.
This report contains policy, planning, and service recommendations arising from the 1979 Part 1 background report and from subsequent feedback and consultations. The Social Planning Council is calling for dramatic shifts in public priorities and planning to re-build Metro’s suburbs for what they were originally intended to be, a place for family living. The absence of urgently needed help for the diverse needs of suburban families is a deep source of concern. Severe spending cutbacks by the Ontario government have delayed the introduction of needed programs for the changing population. The report calls for government to assume once more a leadership role to address economic and social needs, and thereby reverse the passivity and drift of the seventies. What is called for are climates for renewed growth in Metro, responsible public spending policies, new planning capabilities, recognition of adaptation priorities, sensitivity to special needs, and a representative municipal electoral structure.

There’s a very informative article in the October issue of Buildings magazine that you may be interested in reading. It’s called “Tackle Sustainability,” and it’s about how green sports facilities are setting examples for other sites.
“It’s a huge challenge to make sustainability work at these places. Arenas aren’t occupied like an office or multifamily complex. They get a massive influx of people in a short period of time, and then they sit vacant for days,” said Steve D’Iorio, senior vice president at Jones Lang LaSalle, a firm that offers third-party property management. “Sports sites start with what’s feasible.”
One way to begin any sustainable effort is to start small, said IAVM member Scott Jenkins, general manager of the upcoming Atlanta Falcons stadium and chairman of the Green Sports Alliance.
“Easily achieved items include better discipline about turning things off when they’re not being used and implementing low-cost solutions like aerators on faucets and weather stripping on doors,” Jenkins said. “Start with a base knowledge of how you performed in the past and what’s business as usual. Then think about what you can accomplish with a new way of doing things.”

Why are some people successful and others struggle without ever finding the reward they deserve? The key answer is Support. Whatever the field of human endeavour, successful people don’t go it alone. They have support teams, and that means not just staff ministering to their needs. It means, above all, a team of peers and mentors who bring their knowledge and expertise to the table. These teams are called MasterMind Groups.
Youâ€™re setting up to run an Internet based business and obviously need to find a way to take money online. There are a large number of service providers who will allow Internet based businesses to do that. How do you choose between them?
First, there are your local and national banks that provide Merchant Services to businesses. This is generally a costly solution with set-up fees, recurring charges, and lots of hoops to jump through. For many Internet start-ups, these initial costs can be a bit prohibitive, as they have no idea at that stage what turnover they can realistically expect.
If for whatever reason you are unable to obtain the service you need at a reasonable rate from your bank, it isnâ€™t the end of the world. On the contrary, Paypal, Google Checkout, Nochex, Worldpay are probably the best known alternatives, but there are a host of others. Your favourite search engine will have plenty of answers for you.
Once you start checking out their offers and terms and conditions, here is what you have to look out for: Continue reading 6 Pointers To Help Your Internet Business Choose The Right Merchant Service →
The beauty of .Net configuration files (.config) is that they let you easily change the behavior of your application for individual installations. This allows for a great deal of flexibility, especially with service related settings. With this flexibility though, also comes a maintenance challenge. Unlike all of your other application files, configuration files usually can’t be simply replaced during a maintenance update. Doing so would lose any customizations made to support the specific application installation. As your application evolves, it is inevitable that your configuration files will require modification. With AppLife Update, you can easily maintain .Net configuration files without replacing them by modifying the existing files. I’ll cover three different methods that you can use, based on the type and scope of the config file modification that is necessary.
Using Xml Update Actions is great for adding elements and updating attributes. As an example, let’s say that we use appSettings in our application and we need to add a new appSettings value in support of a new feature. We can use an Add Xml Element update action to insert a new appSettings value into the existing config file.
To migrate version 1 installations to version 2, in addition to replacing the application assemblies we must add a new entry to the appSettings collection. To do this, we’ll use an Add Element update action.
When configuring Xml update actions, XPath expressions are used to reference the specific Xml elements that you are interested in reading and writing. To accomplish our goal, we will use an XPath expression to access the appSettings node, and then add a new element to that node. The config file is located in the Application Directory and is named Simple.exe.config.
The name of the element is add, and the new element has two attributes, key and value. Add a new Add Element update action to your update project and configure it as below.
With this action in place, the new element will be added to the configuration file when the update is executed.
Another scenario where Xml actions are great is when we need to update a specific attribute. Using a Change Node action, the value of an existing appSettings entry is easily accomplished. For instance, consider the situation where in v3 of our application, we needed the key2 value to be modified to value3. This can be accomplished in a very similar process. Instead of adding an Xml Element, we can use the Change Node update action to modify an existing value. To accomplish this, we need to know the XPath that references the specific value that needs to be changed. In this case, the XPath expression is /configuration/appSettings/add[@key=”key2”]/@value.
In some circumstances where there are wholesale changes to a config file that would require extensive modifications to the existing file, it could require less effort to extract specific values that are unique to the installation and migrate them to a new config file. In this scenario we use Xml Actions to read specific information from the existing config file and store that information in Shared Properties. We can then replace the config file with an Add & Replace Files update action, and finally use Xml actions to write the information that we stored into the new config file.
Reading the existing value, we’ll add and configure a Read Xml Node Action. Using this action, we set the config file name and XPath just as before. We’ll also designate a Shared Property to store the attribute value. Shared Properties are essentially variables that are scoped across the context of the executing updates. They allow for information to be shared between update actions. The Read Xml Node action will assign the string value of the designated attribute to the designated Shared Property.
After this action executes, the application configuration file will be replaced with a new updated version. However, the value of the attribute we are interested in will also have been reset to its default, non-customized value. To complete the update process we need to use the value that we previously stored to change the new configuration file. A Change Xml Node update action will update the attribute value. When using string value Shared Properties, the value of the Shared Property can be expanded using $SharedProperty$ syntax.
When using Xml Actions and Shared Properties, we read and write string values to the config file. In some circumstances, it can be beneficial to approach the Xml maintenance process within code, where the Xml can be manipulated in fragments. This too can be easily accomplished during an update using the Dynamic Code Action. A Dynamic Code action allows you to easily create a custom update action, which extends the UpdateAction class and overrides, at a minimum, the Execute and RollbackExecute methods.
With a Dynamic Code action you can use C# or VB.Net code to manipulate the deployed client. Here we use the context parameter to access the information we need to accomplish our goal in code. You can access local directory information as well as the Shared Properties collection. With this information, we load an XmlDocument and manipulate the file within our custom code.
During software maintenance updates, application configuration files that are uniquely modified for each installation cannot be simply replaced as changes are made to support new versions. These config files must be modified in-place during the maintenance process. Using AppLife Update, application configuration files can be easily maintained throughout the life of the application and we present three different approaches to accomplishing the goal.
For applications that deploy a Windows Service, updating the installed service can present a maintenance challenge. This is a scenario where integrating AppLife Update makes a difficult task extremely easy to accomplish. Using AppLife Update actions, a Windows Service can be updated in three easy steps.
The release of AppLife Update 4.5 included a few very small changes to our AppLife Update Windows Service. Specifically, in previous versions, if the Windows Application Event Log was full and not configured to replace old events, our service would not apply an update. This issue affects a very small number of systems as since Windows Vista, the default logging behavior is to replace old log events when the event log is full, and the event log has to actually be full to cause an issue. For customers who use our AppLife Update Windows Service, if you choose, you can update the AppLife Update Windows Service on your deployed clients during your next application update. This is optional because if the logging issue isn’t a concern, you can leave the previous version alone. Any past version of the elevation service will operate properly with the latest AppLife Update controller. If you do so choose, here is how you can update the AppLife Update Windows Service (or any other Windows Service for that matter).
To stop the service, we need to know the service name. If you don’t already know the name of the service you are updating, it can be found in the Services manager.
Open your application update project file (.aup). Add a Stop Service action to your update. Set the Service to Stop property to the name of your service. In this case, the service name is KjsUpdateService2.
We use an Add & Replace files on restart action to update the assemblies. The AppLife Update Windows service is initially deployed using an MSI merge module, and is always installed to the Common Files Folder\AppLifeUpdateService2 folder. To update the service, we’ll select the Common Program Files (x86) client folder and set the appropriate sub-directory, and then add the two assemblies that constitute the service. Choosing the x86 variant of the Common Program Files folder will ensure we target the x86 common files folder on x64 operating systems. Using the non x86 Common Program Files directory targets the x64 folder on 64-bit operating systems. On x86 operating systems, there is only one common program files directory, and either variant will target the correct folder.
Note: When updating most Windows Services, even when a service updates itself, the service assemblies can be replaced immediately, without deferring to a restart. The AppLife Update service core assembly houses a class used to marshal information between the User Interface process and the service started worker process. For this reason, even though the service is successfully stopped, a lock is still being maintained on the core service assembly while the update is executed. Because this lock is not released until the update completes, the file replacement is deferred until restart. We do not need to force an operating system restart, as the previous update service can be restarted and function properly until the system is restarted. If a restart were necessary, we could include a Restart Operating System action to accomplish this.
The service assemblies ship with AppLife Update already embedded into the AppLifeUpdateService.msm merge module. After an installation, the assemblies will be in the common program files folder and can be extracted from there. After this action executes, the Windows Service will be updated. Now we just need to restart the service.
The service is restarted by adding a Start Service update action. The action is configured by defining the name of the service to restart. In this case it is again, KjsUpdatService2.
This example assumes an existing update process exists and can be utilized to update the Windows Service. This is usually an installed application that utilizes the Windows Service, and can take responsibility for updating it. A stand-alone Windows Service can become “Self Updating” just as easily by integrating an update process using an AppLife Update controller. There is one point to make in this scenario. When applying an update, you want to use the option to instruct the update controller not to shut down the host application (the service). The Stop Service update action performs a proper service shutdown through the use of the Windows Service Control Manager, and is the recommended method to use when stopping a service for an update.
In my previous post I used a callable action list along with Xml Update Actions to read all of the database connection strings identified in an app.config file, then iterate and update each one of the databases during an application update. The approach I took to accomplish the goal only used built-in Update Actions that are available to me in the Actions Palette. I purposefully chose not to use dynamic code actions (custom update actions) to make a point of what we can accomplish without resorting to writing our own code. However, what can be accomplished with a little custom code is extremely powerful, so now I’m going to revisit the objective, removing the intent of relying only on built-in actions.
In this scenario, the local databases that need to be updated during our application update are listed in the application configuration file. This is very convenient, especially when I want to use built-in actions to find the information. But what if the databases were not so conveniently discoverable? What if you first had to connect to a database server and search through all of the databases on the server for a specific naming convention? What if the databases were passed into the update process from the host application? Using a dynamic code action, scenarios like this can be easily handled.
The feature duo that makes what might initially sound difficult to accomplish during an application update magically easy using AppLife Update are Custom Actions and Shared Properties. Custom Actions are simply classes that inherit from an UpdateAction base class and implements at a minimum, an Execute method and a Rollback method. Shared Properties are a collection of objects that are scoped to the context of the update and can be accessed from any update action.
Note: Custom Actions can also be created in Visual Studio and compiled to an assembly. Custom Action assemblies can be added to an update project through the Project..Settings dialog, or added the Custom Actions folder located within the AppLife Update install directory.
Notice that through the context parameter, the code can access the Shared Properties collection as well as other properties, such as the physical path to the host application. This code simply opens the application configuration file and reads the database connection strings. These strings are then added to a generic List of strings, and that List is added to the Shared Properties collection. If the list is not empty, another Shared Property is added that will be used in a conditional statement.
Using Update Actions and Shared Properties during an application update allows you to very easily accomplish complicated processing on deployed clients. The C# / VB.NET update action lets you add your own code logic to your update, and using Shared Properties, your code can easily interact with built-in actions as well as other custom actions.

This is the preface from Ralph Erskine’s Gospel Sonnets. I have greatly enjoyed this book. Ralph Erskine was a pastor of the Secessionist Church of Scotland. He was born March 15, 1685 and died November 6, 1752. I also own two other books of his containing his sermons. Erskine is Calvinistic in his theology, and helped to lead me down that path as well. As I have time, I plan to share sections of Gospel Sonnets here in this blog. I first learned of this book from reading John G. Paton’s autobiography. Paton describes that his father was reading Erskine’s Gospel Sonnets aloud in a garden when a young lady heard him and commented on its beauty. They married, and John was born to them. John Paton’s story is remarkable. So much so that Sheri and I decided to name our fifth child, Paton Valor Southerland in John G. Paton’s honor.

The good news is that your car insurance policy is not permanent. If you are not happy with the company covering you now, you can always switch to someone different.
If you want to legally drive a car, you need a license, you need a car, and you need to have an insurance policy that covers that car (and you). This is as far as most people get before they start to feel overwhelmed and confused. There are so many different companies and policies to choose from!
The cost of an insurance policy is not universal. You can get the exact same coverage at twenty different prices from twenty different companies. It is entirely possible that you can get the exact same coverage you have now for a fraction of the price from a different company. It is important to note that a lot of different factors go into figuring out what an insurance policy. Not all those factors center on you. The cost of running the business, offering other benefits, etc., also figure into what you pay for your policy. This is why you need to consider more than your out-of-pocket expenses before switching to a new provider.
One of the reasons that many car insurance policies are cheap is because you are limited when it comes to maintenance and repairs. Much like an HMO, your car insurance provider can require that you only take your vehicle to one of its approved repair shops or dealerships. Progressive is famous for this, as is Geico.If it is important to you that you decide who “treats” your car, you might have to come around to paying a higher price.
What “perks” does your insurance policy offer to you? Some of the best perks to look for are the lowering of your rates if you go twelve months without an accident. It is also good to go with a company that will pay for your rental car if you have to leave your car in a repair shop overnight (or for several days). Some companies will also lower your rates if you bundle your car insurance with other types of policies you might need. AllState, for example, offers discounts to people who bundle their car and rental/homeowners’ insurance policies.
When your circumstances change, you should start checking around for a new insurance policy. A new car often requires full coverage until the car is paid off. Some local insurance companies do not offer continued coverage when you move to a new city or state.Another big difference is when you add a new driver to your policy. Depending on that driver’s age (and, sadly, often gender), your rates might go up and you might have to add different areas of coverage to your policy.
What kind of customer service do you get from the company? Are the representatives attentive? Do they treat you with respect? How do the claim adjusters and representatives of the company treat the people who work on your car? It is important to know these things. If you (or your mechanic) is treated rudely or short-changed by the company, it is time to switch.It is also worth it to take some time to look into the ethics of the company. While not a car insurance company, GoDaddy lost floods of customers after it came out that the CEO of the company was into killing large animals for sport (and they lose more every time they air a new commercial). Make sure the powers that be at your insurance company are not engaged in anything that you find abhorrent. You don’t want your money to pay for things that you ethically disagree with, do you? It is possible that your current policy meets all of your needs and requirements. If it does not, though, use these criteria to help you choose someone else.
For one 30-something Florida couple, going without health insurance is a mixed bag of budget and principle.
Bill, Lisa, and their teenage son were covered on an individual policy through 2014. When their plan was cancelled at the end of last year, they found their options limited.
“We feel it’s unfair to have paid years of insurance and then be cut off and forced into higher premiums and less coverage,” she said.
So, they decided to dump their insurance, fork over the tax penalty, and pay their own medical costs as they go.
Millions of Americans have gained health coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The individual mandate means most people are required to purchase health insurance. There’s a bit of incentive, too. Not having insurance can subject you to a tax penalty.
But, the law leaves plenty of room to fall through the cracks. For some, it’s not a matter of choice. They can’t afford coverage but don’t qualify for a subsidy. This is particularly true in states that did not expand Medicaid under the ACA.
Then there’s another group: those who make the conscious decision to pay the penalty rather than pay for health insurance. For some of them, it’s a matter of principle, a rebellion against the mandate. Others compare the cost of insurance to the penalty and opt for the least expensive.
One advantage of health insurance is that insurers negotiate lower rates for services. Often, people without health insurance are billed at significantly higher rates. Bill and Lisa, however, found that many Florida providers offer reasonable self-pay rates.
“An office visit to the walk-in clinic was a $60 copay when we had insurance. The self-pay price is $109,” said Lisa. “That price is not breaking the budget.”
The couple sets aside money each month for medical expenses. They also retained their vision and dental coverage.
It’s not unusual for people without insurance or means to skip treatment or rack up huge medical bills. Bill and Lisa’s family has been lucky. They haven’t had any major health concerns and they’re grateful for that.
It’s a reminder that, after all, we’re mortal and one day we won’t be around anymore. In fact the subject bothers some people so much that they don’t even look into getting life insurance.
To help make getting life insurance easier for you I’m going to tackle a couple of common questions when considering life insurance — why do i need life insurance and how much should I buy?
Life insurance isn’t needed for everyone at every stage of your life. But there tends to be a few times when people get particularly interested in getting life insurance.
According to a recent State Farm survey (go take a look over at GoodNeighbors.com), 4 out of 10 people will buy life because of a life event such as getting married, buying a house, or having a baby.
Having children is what got my wife and I thinking about life insurance. We each wanted to make sure the other would be taken care of should something happen to one of us (or the kids would be cared for should we both leave pre-maturely).
The two biggest aspects we’ll consider here are why you need life insurance and how much you need to cover with it.
Before we look at how much life insurance you should get let’s first look at why you want the life insurance in the first place. This will help us in figuring out how much you need.
This is one of the most common reasons to get life insurance. You want it so that people who would normally depend on your income will be able to take care of themselves after you’re gone. Usually this is your spouse and children.
What you’re basically doing here is getting life insurance as income replacement since you were the wage earner. Take into consideration any income your spouse has as well. You may only need to cover part of your income if your spouse has significant income.
If you’re replacing income to provide for your children you’ll only need it until your youngest turns 18 or until she finishes college. The assumption is they can start their own careers and pay for themselves after that time.
At first this sounds like a strange reason. Why would you need money to payoff debts after you’re gone?
Similar to income replacement, this reason looks at leaving enough money to cover any outstanding debts you may have, the biggest one here probably being a mortgage.
You can also use your life insurance to cover your “final expenses.” By that I means expenses like funeral costs, hospital expenses, or estate taxes.
Some people want life insurance as a means to leave an inheritance to those they are leaving behind. The money isn’t to specifically pay for anything. It’s to make sure your heirs have a little something and are comfortable. Even if your spouse works you may want them to be able to not worry about going back to work.
The stay-at-home spouse provides incredible value to the household. If you have children you might want to consider what it would cost to care for the kids if the stay-at-home spouse we no longer there to care for the household. You might need to cover things like daycare in order to get by.
One way people use life insurance is as a means to help their children pay for college. You can be confident college costs are taken care of even if you won’t be around to see them graduate.
First, you may have other reasons for life insurance I didn’t mention here. That’s fine. This is a guideline of some of the more popular reasons.
Second, it’s OK if you combine different reasons in figuring out how much life insurance you need. The point in this first exercise is to see why you want the life insurance. Once you have your reasons you can better determine how much you’ll need.
Once you know why you want life insurance it gets easier to estimate how much life insurance you need.
There are some general rules of thumb, such as getting seven times or 10 times your yearly salary in coverage, but, really, how much life insurance you need comes down to your personal financial situation, and what you hope your life insurance will accomplish.
Another tool is to look at your income, debts, and any other monetary amounts your heirs may need after you’re gone and then figure out how much total capital you would need in an income-producing portfolio to produce that amount every year, taking out 4% for your yearly needs.
If you earn $50,000 a year, your family would need $1.25 million in capital. According to different economic theories, this method would ensure that money lasts indefinitely. You might want to add that number to estimated funeral expenses and your debt repayment amount so that your family has the needed capital after everything is taken care of.
Another way to figure out what your family needs is to add up yearly expenses or income, and figure out how long they would need to be provided until your youngest child is of age (if you were looking to provide income for your children if you were gone).
If you make $50,000 a year — and assume that you spend that much — and your youngest is five years old, you would need to figure $50,000 a year for 13 years (until the youngest turns 18). In our example, that would be $650,000. You can then add other expenses that you have, such as debt pay off, funeral expenses and other things you would like to pay for (such as college costs) to the base income replacement number.
When you are looking at how much life insurance you need make sure to take retirement account contributions (this could lower the amount you’d need), the cost of benefits (like health insurance), and the cost of services that might need to be hired (like child care or housekeeping) into consideration.
Again, this all depends on your reasons for the money. You wouldn’t need the same amount to cover college costs as you would as income replacement or debt repayment or if you just want to cover funeral costs.
A lot of employers offer up life insurance. Many times though this life insurance renews year-to-year and depends on you still working there (the plan may not be portable or be expensive if it is). Think of insurance from employers like this as icing on the cake and not as a big part of your calculations.
You may not want to think about not being around anymore but making a plan now can ensure your loved-ones are taken care of. It’s a pretty good feeling to know your family won’t have to worry about money as they mourn.
We didn’t go into the different types of insurance that are out there such as term vs. whole life insurance or other products like universal and hybrids but the typw you buy may have an impact on your calculations.
When you ask yourself ‘how much life insurance should I buy?’ take a look at the reasons you want life insurance and you have a good starting point in estimating your needs.
“Funke Akindele Has Few Years To Live, She Must Marry A Gateman Before She Can Have A Child – Lagos Prophet
Popular Lagos prophet, and the Founder of Mountain of Blessing and Miracle Church of Christ, Dr Olagoroye Faleyimu, in a recent chat with YMG, revealed that actress Funke Akindele must marry a gateman for her to have a child. .
His words: “Recall that I have once said that Funke Akindele will keep acquiring more wealth, this was even before she started getting endorsement deals. She chose wealth and fame when she was coming to earth. .
She is a promised child who has a limited time to live, and that is why I have been clamoring that she must have a special prayer so that she can genuinely conceive and have her own kids.
It is not something you ask a pastor to do for you. Counterfeit prophets have been predicting this and that about her, claiming they saw a set of twin in her womb, and that was why the rumour was everywhere a few months ago that she was pregnant. .
She needs to open her mouth to deliver herself. If she fails to do the prayer, another grace for her is to marry a poor and unpopular pastor, the person will get the solution and she will have her own child.
Another way she can break the covenant is to probably marry a gate-man. This is the promise she made with her members in the spiritual realm. It might be difficult for her to have a child if she fails to break the covenant. .
If she comes to me for prayers and I pray for her, she won’t conceive. I can only give her some prayer points as guideline. Immediately she engages in the special prayers, one of the signs she should watch out for is that, her money and endorsements will be reducing and within 2 months, the pregnancy will come.
For the husband, he also has his own battle that he needs to pray about, in order for him to be set free. If not, he will marry about 5 wives before one will eventually stay. His story is like that of the Ooni of Ife, the king needs to marry 2 wives at a go before he can experience a peaceful marriage. .
The Ooni of Ife can marry another wife and retake his first wife also. If not, he will marry 7 before one can stay.“
Garlic is known to be an extremely effective vegetable, which can provide an immense number of health benefits. The list of diseases that garlic can kill is long, and includes:
These are only a small part of the health conditions in which garlic can be of great use due to its powerful properties to fight infection.
This amazing vegetable has been used to treat and cure cancer throughout the ages. Even Hippocrates recommended the consumption of large amounts of crushed garlic as a cure for cancer.
If you decide to heal your cancer using this remarkable item as an anti-fungal, you should take at least 5-6 cloves of (crushed) garlic per day. There are about 12 cloves per the whole pod of garlic.
Moreover, note that you should let them sit for at least 15 minutes after they have been crushed. This amount of time is needed to release an enzyme (allinase) that produces these anti-fungal, anti-cancer compounds.
However, you can eat the raw or cooked garlic as part of sandwiches or other meals, but according to research, garlic supplements do not produce the same anti-cancer, anti-fungal results.
Garlic also permeates the research literature: the biomedical database known as MEDLINE, provided by the National Library of Medicine, contains 4245 study abstracts on garlic.
According to the data given there, garlic is extremely important in preventing or treating well over 150 health conditions, ranging from cancer to diabetes, infection to plaque buildup in the arteries, DNA damage to mercury poisoning.
Furthermore, in the research on Greenmedinfo.com, it was also stated that garlic has value in 167 health conditions or disease symptoms, but the greatest density of research indicates garlic’s role in preventing and/or treating Cardiovascular Disease and Cancers, the two primary causes of death within high-income countries.
Inexpensive, time-tested, safe and delicious, natural remedies and spices like garlic have been ‘life saving’, and consequently, in ancient times, many were worth their weight in gold.
Nowadays, although we are aware of its power and are starting to be more and more convinced in it, it seems that doctors will always prescribe drugs as part of our treatments.
Therefore, you are responsible for your own health. Learn how you can use the nature to improve your health and always use its items if they work and they are safe.
Bitter melon or karela is a member of the family Cucurbitaceae, which is common in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, Asia, South America and the Caribbean.
It is an extremely beneficial plant which has been valued due to its remarkable healthy properties for ages all over the world, and the Eastern populations mostly consume it as food.
The plant has fragmented leaves and resembles zucchini, but has a more elongated shape. Its flowers change the color from orange-yellow one to yellow as it ripens.
When ripe, the fruit opens in three parts, and its seeds are numerous and red in color. It is used as a medicine all around the world, and the Eastern populations mostly use it for consumption.
Yet, despite its various other favorable properties, it is a potent natural anti-diabeticand possesses powerful anti-carcinogenic qualities.
The bitter melon has a bitter taste and is loaded with essential nutrients. To illustrate this, the nutritional value of 100 grams of its flesh is as follows:
The unripe fruits are high in potassium, vitamin c, phosphorus, while when ripe, they are high in lectin which reduces blood sugar. This beneficial fruit fights against free radicals, which cause degenerative diseases and lead to aging.
Furthermore, it enhances the immunity, destroys carcinogenic cells, and treats HIV – infections. Another advantage is that the bitter melon is very low in calories, but high in vitamin C, B1, B2, and B3.
In the traditional Indian and Chinese medicine, this fruit has been used to treat a cough, burns, fever, skin issues, colic, and painful menstrual cycles.
It effectively detoxifies the liver and helps weight loss, and its leaves can be used to prepare tea which helps in the prevention of malaria, and viral diseases like measles and chickenpox.
Its ingredient glycoprotein lectin is very helpful since its activity is similar to the one of insulin due to its ability to reduce the glucose concentration in the blood and functions as an immunomodulator.
Therefore, the consumption of this fruit will be of great help in the case of leukemia, neuroblastoma, colon, liver, prostate, and lung cancer. However, remember that it should not be consumed by pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.
Scientific studies have shown that it can cure several different cancer types, due to the active ingredients it contains, which inhibit the metabolism of glucose in affected cells and reduce the sugar they need, thus forcing them to‘’starve’’.
The findings of researchers at the Saint Louis University Cancer Center show that the bitter melon has a double action: it destroys cancer cells and prevents its further development.
Additionally, experts at the University of Colorado Cancer Center found that this fascinating fruit can efficiently prevent the side-effects of chemotherapy, and also decelerates the growth of the pancreatic tumor.
Recent studies have confirmed that the bitter melon effectively prevents and treats diabetes, carcinomas, HIV infections, and also detoxifies the body.
The bitter melon can be consumed raw, as a tincture, juiced or cooked. Yet, note that its excessive consumption may cause abdominal pain and diarrhea.
His fruit has been used as an anti-diabetes natural remedy for centuries, s scientists decided to examine its activity. They isolated three major compounds of the bitter melon, identified as hypoglycemic agents:
-Charantin – it is a typical cucurbitane: type triterpenoid, with potent antidiabetic properties. The research has shown that it is even more effective than the agent tolbutamide.
-Polypeptide –p- a hypoglycemic protein which when injected subcutaneously reduces the blood glucose levels in gerbils, langurs, and humans. It can serve as a plant-based insulin replacement in the case of diabetes type 1 since its activity is similar to the one of the human insulin in the body.
A clinical study which was conducted in January 2011 and published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology showed that the daily use of 2000mg bitter melon greatly lowered the blood glucose levels in people with diabetes type 2.
Experts at the University of Colorado Cancer Center found that this fruit can be used to treat pancreatic cancer since its extract reduces the glucose metabolism in pancreatic cells and thus kills them.
Scientists wanted to find out if they could apply the extract directly to pancreatic cancer cells because the melon extract has a beneficial effect in the case of diabetes type 2, which is a predecessor of pancreatic cancer.
In the case of mice, those fed with bitter juice had 60% lower risk of developing cancer than the control group.
A study conducted in 2010 showed that the extract of this fruit can cure breast cancer as well. Namely, the extract reduces the cells proliferation and induces apoptotic cell death.
The apoptosis resulted in increased polymerase cleavage and caspase activation. Furthermore, researchers confirmed that BME modulates signal transduction pathways for inhibition of breast cancer cell growth and can serve as a dietary supplement in the prevention of breast cancer.
Numerous other studies have provided evidence that this impressive fruit effectively treats colon, prostate, and liver cancer.

I know there's a lot of hate and despair on /fit/ but I'd like to remind those with no gf, lifting should give you confidence. If you're able to lift heavy goddam weights then you should have no trouble with talking to women. Get out of the mentally that you might have autism and scare women off. Just think about how you lift heavy fucking weights and go up to them. Remember women can sense despair and its a huge turn off. I hope you'll be inspired and go talk to that qt youve been eyeing for awhile.
Has /fit/ ever had a true shoulder impingement? Did they actually cure it? I have had it for 6-7 months now and it still bothers me. I need to figure out how to fix this shit once and for all. I do the shoulders down and back thing all day but idk if its really helping. I need this shit fixed so I can get back to lifting. Please help
look you need to both keep the inflammation down in the shoulder joint and strengthen the rotator cuff and deltoid
look up proper form of standing overhead press, biggest thing is to shrug your shoulders during the movement,...
I cant afford a therapist but I saw a ortho 1 time and he prescribed me with epidural which is like a advil on steroids. Would that work too?
First time here and desu I'm looking for the thing that inspires people to become fit, I've found mine but I want to know what others define as their purpose for getting fit.
That's what motivates me brah. I hate how the last couple of years have been for me, that's my groove now. Get into life. "Get not fat, get fit."
Bro-science aside, is there really any point in doing anything other than Flat Bench Vs Incline Bench in terms of muscular development?
Right now I do both, but really want to focus on flat benching 3 times a week to bring my bench up...this means I'll have to stop doing incline bench for now. Will this have a negative impact on my upper chest even if I am getting stronger and stronger at flat bench?
if you want to flat bench for the sake of improving your flat bench. specific adaptation to imposed demand if gonna make your flat bench better.
if you're trying to build up ant delt because it is what is lacking aesthetics wise then you should keep incline.
Well I do Push-Presses and lateral raises for delts......hence why I really need to drop 1 major pressing movement in order to allow for more progress on specifically flat benching.
I recently switched from Flat bench to Incline bench just to bring my OHP up, aside from that Flat bench can hit upper pecs just as well with proper activation.
New to /fit/ not sure what your idea on calisthenics is but tell me, will I ever gain any weight with that? I am pretty skinny and from what Ive heard its harder to grow than with lifting weights.
My story: started about a year ago for a couple of months, was able to get from 0 pullups to 3 sets of 10 pull ups. but didnt rly get weight and didnt observe a visible progress. then I stopped
Now I am exercising again but still have doubts if I it's worth it- this time I am eating a bit better but still not sure if it's just the diet thing or if doing only...
You will gain some weight, but once you adapt enough without progressive overload you won't get much bigger. There's a lot of things you can do to make a certain exercise harder as you go along though, you can take it pretty far. But will you get HYOOGE? No.
what's stopping someone from claiming to be vegan on YouTube, but just eating animal products camera?
He clearly hopped on the extra gains boosting train. Probably uses it to prove how effective vegan lifestyle is. What a fagget
One time I was at somebody's house and he had a piano so I started playing and everyone was enjoying it. I usually hate being the center of attention unless it's me on the keys
It's not gyno I just recently had a visit with a doctor and said it wasn't. Just fat. I thought push-ups and rowing type excerices but I was told it actually makes it worse cause you build muscle more mass. That true?
And yes ur chest will add muscle under the fat pushing the fat out more. Looks odd but once u lose the fat its all gucci
you cant target fat. doing sit ups wont get rid of belly fat, doing push ups wont fix this. just drop a few pounds.
look up 75 hobbies for men on art of manliness. Go out on long walks in the sun, hell, maybe even socialize.
all i do is play games and watch anime until that time of the day where i have a little bit of meaning to my life
Enjoy the hard work you did the day before and the work yet ahead. Alternatively you could just be yourself :^)
alright so which one of you asian /fit/ autists tried to get the number of my 14 year old sister at the gym?
We have black bruhs/grills who frequient /fit/ but actual niggers dont know how to find us, and the few who do stumble here treat it like facebook

Do people really care? Most fans of these games are girls or people who havent touched a zelda game since the gamecube.
>The game will feature 16 playable Servants. Here is the full list of the characters that have been announced:
The dev just announced they sold above their target, next race release is Space Marines in June and then Tau a few months after that.
Animaniacs on SNES is also one of my favorites, also by Konami. Haven't played the Genesis game though (it's a completely different game)
I actually found this game to be really enjoyable, all the way up until the last chapter. The way the ending worked it, kind of just invalidated everything I'd done regardless of what choice I made, which was a really unsatisfying way to end the game.
No, when game companies realize that stopping piracy doesn't actually increase sales they'll stop wasting money on anti-piracy measures.

In a project, I need to benchmark some things and one of those thing is to time how long it takes to have an answer. In my code, this means measuring how long it takes between two different methods of an object are called. As I’m learning Python, I thought that a beautiful to do that would be with a class decorator.
If you don’t know anything about class decorator, I advise you read chapter 38.4 “Coding Class Decorators” from the book Learning Python by Mark Lutz and if you don’t even know anything about decorators, shame on you! No, I’m kidding, then just read chapter 38.2.
In a nutshell, a decorator makes it possible to replace a function (or a class) with another by just writing @myDecorator before the function or class. In my case, by writing @TwoMethodsTimer(“requestMedia”, “startPlayback”) before the class I want to benchmark, I will gather statistics on how long it takes to start the playback once I requested a media. Here is a first version of this decorator that I did after reading chapter 38.4 and some other blog posts and stack overflow threads:
In this example, we measure how long it takes between calling methodA and then methodB. It works great and all. We’re happy, until we do something new:
Here we see that internally calling methodB (self.methodB()) does not trigger the stopTimer! That’s because it doesn’t seem to be calling __getattr__ when being already in the same object. I tried several variant by intercepting calls to __getattribute__ but it’s a mess and when it’s not doing infinite recursive calls, I just don’t see the calls to the method I’m interested in.
To solve this problem, instead of hijacking calls for the __getattr__ method and looking at the name of the method being called, I just modify the attributes of the object when being created. Here is the code:
Just after the instantiation of the object, we change the mapping of the two methods we’re interested in with our own methods and store the old ones somewhere else. This trick works for external and internal method calls.

Tapping a global network of musicians, producers, engineers and other sonic innovators, Shure brings you exclusive interviews with the people shaping the world of audio.
For the latest episode, Thomas Banks checked in with Rick Valentin and Rose Marshack from the pioneering US indie band Poster Children.
Formed at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana back in 1987, the group has long been known for its intelligent brand of punk-infused rock and DIY ethic. They have just released their 12th album, which was produced by Chicago-area legend Steve Albini.
In the podcast, Valentin and Marshack discuss how they got started, what’s kept them going strong for so long and what it’s like to stay an underground favorite for their entire career.
“Every time we got a new drummer, we changed the name. And the last time was Poster Children,” explains frontman Valentin.
While they were establishing themselves in the Midwest by playing shows on the weekends, the couple had day jobs working as computer programmers for a flight simulator company.
“We would play in Chicago or Madison or Iowa City on a Friday night,” says band bassist Marshack. “Then we would drive up to Minneapolis, which is another five hours away, and play there on Sunday. We’d drive home and park in the lot for work and start programming assembler language on Monday. It was wild.”
Long before the internet, the indie musicians were part of a DIY network of bands, clubs, record stores and fanzines.
“Every town had these networks,” says Valentin, adding that such scenes still exist. But the web has changed the dynamic dramatically: “Someone from Norway can set up a death metal tour online through that grassroots network.”
Having built a solid regional fan base, they were initially reluctant to move to a major record label like the other alternative bands at the time.
“Hüsker Dü had jumped to a major label and it had seemed to ruin them in our perception as indie rockers. And Sonic Youth had jumped to Geffen and it seemed like they were okay, but they didn’t become hit superstars,” Valentin says.
But Poster Children would soon get swept up in the hysteria following the success of Seattle grunge giants Nirvana just as they were heading out on tour.
“By the time we hit New York there were 15 major labels talking to us,” adds Valentin. “It was like they were scrambling: ‘We have to get more Nirvanas.’”
They eventually signed with Sire but never managed to break through to the big time. But decades later, they’re totally fine with that.
“We would have liked to have been a hit band. Have millions of people listen to our records,” says Valentin. “But we were always realistic that we weren’t going to change our band to do that.”
Instead they used their advance money to buy computers and recording equipment so they could continue to do things on their own terms.
Now, after re-releasing their seminal work Daisychain Reaction during its 25thanniversary in 2016, the band is back with the new album Grand Bargain!, which was also recorded with the no-nonsense engineer Albini at the helm.
“I don’t want to just play old stuff,” says Valentin. “The thing about recording with Steve Albini is that he’s still doing it like how we did back then in the 90s.”

I wish I could give you a play by play of the farm vacation but 1.) you really don’t care that much and 2.) I don’t have that kind of time.
But I will do an extended post on the highlights, observations and musings. More details with likely come out as this trip cannot be summed up here.
I had really no expectations of how this vacation was going to be but it soon became clear that this was like no other “vacation” I had ever been on. Ilsa and I spent a few minutes trying to rename this trip and came to a cross between agro-tourism, alternative vacation, manual labor camp. It will take me a few days to really process everything but I do know that from this trip I gathered a new appreciation for food, manual labor, my place and position of privilege, hot showers, and friendship. I learned that value of sweat equity is immeasurable. I have a renewed sense of hope, spirit, optimism and faith. And I saw the power of prayer and action come to life.
Things I did: Raked, hiked, shoveled manure, transplanted seedlings, removed rocks from the fields, rescued barb wire from the forest, picked up litter, removed roots, demolished a dog house, built a deer fence, ate, laughed, relaxed, soaked up the sun, got soaked by the rain, watched a thunderstorm, fell asleep to the pouring rain, saw a moose, porcupine, raccoon, wild turkey, turkey vulture, hawks, slept, cooked, dunkin’ dought-ed, read, and so much more.
Besides the many “first” listed above, here are some notable first: First time in a laundry mat, first time to OHOP pizza with “The West Wing” shrine, first time eating fava beans, rice cakes with peanut butter, and leeks, first time not able to get the dirt out from under my toe nails, first time cutting a guy’s hair, plus a few more.
Things I did not do: Shave, cry, blow dry my hair, put on makeup, miss the office, drive a car, sit in traffic, wake up to an alarm, or anything else really related to city living.
One of the best things about mine and Ilsa friendship is our ability to talk the same talk, be brutally honest with each other with no judgment or resentment, and laugh at the ridiculousness of life. Here are just a few conversation highlights.
I: So, you’re telling me that if Clive Owen walked through the door right now you wouldn’t sleep with him?
I: Ok, but hypothetically, if Clive Owen were to walk through that door, you’re telling me you would not sleep with him.
We were sent to the grocery store to pick up milk. We came back with 10 bags of groceries. Ilsa says, “Never send two skinny hungry girls to the grocery store.”
After Removing 250’ of barb wire from the forest, Ilsa calls the hardware store to inquire about the cost of barb wire:
Ilsa called and was screaming at me today. Screaming. Screaming for joy, I think. I think the real purpose of her call was to 1.) tell me about the hawks nest with the baby hawks, 2.) share wha a beautiful day it was on the farm, 3.) make me laugh. Her day consisted of spreading cow manure. She was going to wait until I got there to help. I secretly thought, “Spreading cow-s is not my idea of a vacation.” But hanging in the sun with forest and fields…that, my friends, is a vacation.
“Does this look like a lot to you?” – Boss man referring to his Due Date Monitor (Yes, now would be a good day to look at your Due Date Monitor. And Yes, 3 pages does seem like a lot. Yes, yes it does.)
“I’m going to run out of days and when I do, its not going to be pretty.” – Boss man (Really? It being April 14th and all…)
Consider this a public service announcement: Your tax return is due in 3 days.Countdown to Anahata (The Farm): 3 Days
Well, its Easter. I suppose something reverent should come to mind besides the fact I wish I were more reverent. But I will say this: The farm is just starting out. The land once grew life, a family, memories. Now there is a new opportunity to breathe new life into it. New memories and new opportunities to find hope, healing and at the very least a vegetable or two. So on Easter, I pray for new beginning, life renewed and a love far greater than we will ever know.
Week 1: Felt very inspired and determined. Took the before pictures; that was a reality check. I know in my heart of hearts I can do this. I ate really well, exercised hard. I’m tracking what I’m eating at every meal and my snacks. I re-cut out wheat and trying to eat whole foods (non-processed foods).
Week 2: I was hungry. So hungry. Still running outside and returned to the gym, including spinning class. Going ok with food, indulging a little more than I should. But still really watching my sugar intake because that is my biggest weakness. I brought in my yoga ball to work and now sit on that to help with the core and improve posture. Still working on strength training and some new cardio like jump rope and stairs.
Week 3: Hungry, cranky, tired of sitting on an effing ball. Couldn’t get enough to eat and there are not enough hours in the day. I’m tired. If I ate one more salad I might have gone ape-s on someone one. I’ve eaten wheat, lots of sugar, fried food (I never!) and dairy. Which makes me feel like ass. Feeling de-motivated. I’ve got a long ways to go and my mood and perspective are not helping. Every day has been, “Ok, this is the day to start over.” I’m tired of starting over and kicking myself for giving into whims when I know I my willpower is stronger than I’m demonstrating.
Week 4: On the re-bound from a crap week. Have a fresh new outlook. Back to sitting on the ball without cheating. Staved off the sugar cravings. I think the arrival of the sun has helped. Went for really long walks in the sun instead of run which was rejuvenating and really better in the long run. Read a great article called, “Why are you running when you haven’t even learned how to walk?” Great insight. So I’m learning to walk to help achieve my shorter long term goals. Had meals and snacks that I’ve really enjoyed.
I might have either 1.) a hollow leg OR 2.) 6 stomachs, like a cow. While I cannot confirm or deny the possibility of either, I’m claiming both. You should see how much I can eat! The vast amount of food that I can eat really is astonishing, unfeminine and expensive. It must stop.
While I am more tired, I have more energy, if that makes sense. My skin feels good after a good sweat. I fantasize that I can see some new definition in my arms but I really don’t know. I’m not a huge fan of the appearance of my arms so I generally keep them hidden from sight. I can see definition in my hip flexor muscle. All around been a good first month. One down, two to go.
One of the partners said, “you look most elegant today.” I just got back from the gym so I not sure what that says.
“In the meantime, can I be of service to you? Do you need a large box moved, I have been working out.” - MH. *OMG I about died.
“I am glad I moved to Petersham but there are some kinks that need to be worked out: source of income and spouse. Can’t wait to figure both of those pieces out!” Generally the former is worked out before a move, but whatevs….I do like how she refers to it as a “kink” rather than something larger than most people may see it.
Lastly, Lord bless the person who found my Amex on the floor at the gym and turned it into the front desk. Thank you kind soul.
Pre-vacation anxiety is settling in. I have lots to do so that I can feel ok when on vacation. Laundry, clean, *cough*dopersonaltaxreturn*cough*, grocery shopping, pay bills, blog, pack (what does one pack to go farming?), etc.
I really don’t have much to say about the farm today because work in getting in the way of my personal life and have quite had the time to think about anything beyond what I need to do in the next 5 minutes.
I just called one of those phone banks in India pretending to be “British Airways.” So weird. I thought of the movie Slumdog Millionaire and Thomas Friedman’s book The World is Flat.
One of my favorite things to do is sit on hold with airlines….favorite. And by favorite I mean, makes me want to poke my eyeballs out.
Yesterday in kickboxing, the instructor said, “I don’t swear is class so I can shake it, spank it, slap it all I want.”…or something along those lines. I was hysterically laughing on the inside. There are just some moves that I won’t do in public.
Recent Music Appreciation: Stone Temple Pilots, Counting Crows, & Pearl Jam. And I’m about 10 year behind the popularity….which is about right.
I’m holding off on watching the seventh and final season of The West Wing because once it’s over I will become a shell of a human being. Its so brilliant. I will be searching for a new show so recommendation are now being accepted.
King of Leon’s Sex on Fire, is my favorite song to rock out to. If I could break 100mph on the open road, I would want to do it to this song.
Have you ever typed a word that you insist you’ve spelled correctly only to have that annoying red line come up? Then you right click to change it and you get “No Suggestions.” I get that all the time and it makes me feel soooo not smart. I think its because I take liberty with language and make words up. I’m allowed.
My bus goes through the tunnel and at my stop, the driver always announces the Post Office. This seems unnecessary because 1.) its not like a great tourist destination that holds some historic value; 2.) it quite an ugly post office so there really is no need to go publicizing it; 3.) Who really goes to the post office anymore and is it really so many people that is needs to be announced?
Whenever my boss wants me to make of copy of something he tells me to, “take a picture of it.” I had never heard this before here and every time he says it I think, “is that anything like making a copy of it?”
Edmonds may become the first city in Washington to regulate/demand/charge for the use of plastic bags. This is when politics makes me livid. Yes, please now tell me how and how not to get my groceries home. Seat Belt law….fine. Helmet Law…annoying but whatever. In loco parentis laws…stifling but pick your battles. My problem: I don’t plan far enough ahead of when I do or do not go to the grocery store, let alone planning to bring used grocery bags with me. That’s why I never buy green bananas! I don’t plan that far ahead! I am all about saving the planet but c’mon. Taxing me on plastic bags is like spitting on a forest fire. I don’t live in Edmonds but I fear it could catch on.
Its snowing in Petersham apparently. Better there than here because if we have any more snow in Seattle, someone might go postal. Not me, I love the snow, but someone. The forecast for Petersham is cold at night, warmish during the day and mostly dry. If I didn’t think “thumbs up” was a really lame way to express something good, I would give the weather a thumbs up.
There were wild turkey and a porcupine in the back yard on the farm yesterday. I hope I get to see them.
I got my “PreFlight Notification” in the inbox today. It sent a quick twinge of fear because there really is so much to do before I go. We’ll see if it gets done.
“Skinny jeans” should be re-named to “make you feel fat jeans.” Especially when worn straight from the dryer.
Something I’m not particularly proud of: I love country music. Like really love it. I love real music, too, so save your judgement.
I’m not a big fan of being called “Ms.” Or “Ma’am.” Not sure why. Maybe because it has a connotation of maturity and sense of responsibility, of which I have neither.
I really don’t like restrooms. Public or otherwise. Really my own is the only one and even at that….gross. It wasn’t until I got to college that I was able to start using restaurant restrooms more easily after being forced to share a community bathroom my first year. Lucky Jason had the boat which had 2 bathrooms so my time there limited the use of the community bathrooms. It wasn’t until moving to New York that my restroom standard plummeted to non-existent. It wasn’t until Egypt where I peed in a whole in the ground AND peed outside for the first time (in the Sahara Desert, thankyouverymuch). This recently has become problematic since I’ve been drink water by the gallon. The restrooms at work are fine, but still…
I picked a pencil out of my writing utensil container. The pencil had teeth marks. Two habits I don’t have: biting my nails and chewing on my pencils. The pencil is now in the trash.
A co-worker of mine was talking about the men’s locker room at the same gym we go to. His comments were in regard to the lack of modesty in the locker room. This grosses me out beyond belief. Don’t get me wrong, I love men, but a bunch of naked ones in a locker room. Gross. Men, it is not like this in the women’s locker room. And the women that are naked, you wouldn’t want to see them.
I would love to be a librarian…just would prefer not to look like one. Which is currently my look now.
The more and more I work in public accounting the more and more I am convinced that money cannot and will not by you happiness.
I use pure raw sugar as a skin exfoliator and organic olive oil straight from the jar as my nightly moisturizer. It make me feel like a baguette but my skin has never had fewer problems. I’d liked to thank my aesthetician for that tip and swear by her services. Monthly facials are a must for winters in Seattle.
Someone called me “svelte” today. I appreciated that because 1.) it was a compliment; and 2.) stellar word choice.
"To make $10,000.00 how many jars of pickles do I need to sell?" is like a really bad SAT question....but I’m working on it. Along with researching pickling associations, canning pickles, garlic festivals, and how to start a business in Massachusetts, and rates for renting a CDC kitchen in Greenfield. That’s for a whole separate post.
Wow, chocolate really is amazing…I’ve been fortunate enough to enjoy some really good stuff recently.
I’m about to fall asleep while on hold with British Airways trying to confirm my boss’s seats for his trip to Scotland. Not to sound ungrateful but this is 4 years of higher education working at its finest. Oozing pride as I write and wait.
My boss was literally pounding his head on his desk this morning….that’s what busy season does to you.
I love when songs come on the radio and remind me of a really great memory and I can’t help but smile. This happened twice today.
A guy on the street yesterday asked me where the closest Starbucks was. I thought, “Look around dude, this is Seattle.” I said, “Go to the end of the block, take a right, and it’s on your left.”
Woke up ear-ly to meet Randy and Erin at the Pancake Carole in Bellevue. Rainier Mountain was out in its full glory. Enjoyed strawberry pancakes, hash browns, and great conversation.
Drove to mom’s and dad’s to meet mom to drive to Mt. Vernon to meet with more family. Mt. Baker majestically silhouetted against the sky. Enjoyed a lovely lunch with Auntie Nadine, Mom and friends. Surrounded in heat as the sun warmed the drive.
Drove back home to mom and dad’s. Gave Big Red a bath. She sparkles now. Was a very reflective, thoughtful and productive car washing. I realized I’ve been washing cars from the same brown bucket my entire life. It could quite possibly be the most perfect bucket if there were such a thing. I hope that bucket never gets a hole. Not sure I’ll be able to wash a car without it.
Retreating from the indoors, I crawled into the truck bed of Dad’s Ford. Rolled up the jeans, took off the shoes, removed as many layer of clothes as to remain modestly appropriate should a wild animal came across my path and I need to dart for safety. I basked in the sun. Started a new book. Listened to the birds and felt the sun soaking into my wintered skin.
Today was the real first day of spring after a very long winter. I could go on metaphorically speaking, but I mean it as literal as possible. The sun literally tingled my skin. The birds were lively and active. The country fields were colorful and flourishing. I wish there were a grander word for “glorious” that I knew, because that’s the word I would use.

First of all, Original Medicare will cover the cost of one wellness visit with your doctor per year.
A yearly check-up will include routine measurements like your blood pressure, a review of your prescriptions and medical history, and an assessment of any risks to your physical and mental health.
Until now, Ohio Medicare recipients only received a one-time preventive exam, the “Welcome to Medicare” exam during the first year you sign up for Medicare Part B coverage.
If you’re enrolled in a private Ohio Medicare Advantage health plan, check with your insurer about whether your wellness visit will be covered at no cost in 2011.
Most people on Medicare will pay the same Part B premiums this year as they did in 2010 – either $96.40 or $110.50 per month.
If you enroll in Part B for the first time in 2011, or if your premiums aren’t deducted from your Social Security check, you’ll pay $115.40 a month.
For higher-income beneficiaries (single people with annual taxable incomes over $85,000 or married couples with incomes above $170,000), Part B premiums will range from $161.50 to $369.10.
Also starting this year, Ohioans in those income brackets will pay a monthly surcharge of $12 to $69.10 for their prescription drug coverage.
If you have an Ohio drug plan and reach the coverage gap, or “donut hole,” you’ll receive a discount on your prescriptions.
Ohio Medicare enrollees get 50 percent off the price of brand-name drugs and 7 percent off generics while in the “donut hole.”
Even though you’ll pay less for a brand-name drug, you can count the prescription’s full price toward the amount you’re required to spend on drugs to qualify for catastrophic coverage.
That way, you’ll enjoy lower out-of-pocket costs while in the “donut hole,” but you’ll still become eligible for Medicare’s catastrophic coverage as quickly as you would without the discount.
Without an Ohio Medicare Supplement, you’ve usually paid 20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount for lab tests and screenings after you met your annual deductible.
But starting in 2011, you don’t have to worry about a deductible, co-payment or coinsurance for a broad range of preventive services.
We now have more time to choose and join a private health or drug plan when the annual open enrollment period gets an earlier start than usual in the fall.
If you want or need to change your private Medicare Advantage health plan, there’s a new annual “disenrollment” period allows you to switch back to Original Medicare and a drug plan between January 1 and February 14.
This replaces a January-to-March enrollment period when you could switch between Original Medicare and the Medicare Advantage program or move from one private plan to another. The best way to understand what’s new is to refer to your “Medicare and You 2011” handbook, which you should have received by mail this fall.
If you still need one, call 1-800-MEDICARE and request a free copy, or visit our guidebook page and download it.
Request your copy of the Ohio Department of Insurance publication “Guide to Medicare Supplement Insurance Medicare Options and Part D”
These are a couple of little purchases. The New Workbox took my fancy. It is from a set of school reading cards. Such lovely simple hand drawn graphics which are screenprinted using a limited palette.
In a word NO. Some mischievous people love to start and pass on a rumor! but please it is always a good idea to check out facts from the source before passing on false information.
As I said in my last post for the year I have decided to put the business up for sale. (look back for details)
Patchwork on Central is a Great business and fabrics are my passion. As anyone who has been in lately can see it is business as usual, with as much new fabric as ever. I have just signed a 3 x 3 x 3 year lease so am not in any great hurry.
I will be sending out my intentions to everyone on my email list after the end of this financial year as well as advertise, as I have done no more about selling than put it on my blog and tell a few customers.
Don't you just love a gift that keeps coming! I received a subscription to the gorgeous British magazine Selvedge for Christmas last year and get such a surprise when I get home and find it sitting on the bench.
It takes me two seconds to rip the envelope open flick through and then many days to devour every word and image in it.
When seeing the ad in the mag, I did feel a bit jealous of Adrienne and Carolyn from the shop, who will soon be on their way to London to see the wonderful Quilt Exhibition at the V&A.
This is a quick project that I have made using a half metre pack (8x16th's from the shop) You will get quite a few scarves from this pack.
This gives me a bit of space to re arrange the pieces if I feel inclined. With this quilt after first placing the yellow's I decided that they were a little light. The white background that was coming through made them stand out too much. So out came my old skills of tea dying (from my country phase)
This is really good for that fabric that just does not go with anything. Test fabric first with a small piece, less tea if you just want to take the brightness out. Don't go too dark as it just goes ugly.
After many requests I have decided to run a few Saturday classes dedicated to making and designing your own contemporary quilt using the ripped method. I have had many students achieve great results in past classes, I am told it helps get any frustrations out of your system at the same time.
Anyone interested just call into the shop, phone or email. I run a casual basics class every second week with a max of 6 students. This class will concentrate on design and how to achieve a balanced quilt.
The photo's are of my current project using a variety of Kaffe fabrics and Japanese fabrics currently in stock. (yet to be sewn) It will be in the shop later this week for anyone who would like a look.
Tram Destination rolls seem to be everywhere at the moment, but quite expensive. I had these destinations printed over 18 months ago and it is a cheap way of getting the look on a budget.
We sell the panels, for $10 each on the lightweight linen, or $30 a panel on the heavier French linen. (really nice for cushions.)
I used the lightweight one to make the door curtain and put a piece of calico between them and top and bottom. I think is very appropriate for the shop at last stop tram 5.
You often read of the supposed rivalry between Melbourne and Sydney. I have always thought is a media beat up.
What a beautiful building. We all get so busy with our day to day goings on that we don't stop to admire the beauty we all have in our own cities.
As usual I have been pretty ruthless. All bags and quite a few clothes etc in the store are all 50% OFF.
As I am no longer Australian Distributor of the French products Place des Lices I am clearing out the warehouse!
A great opportunity to stockpile presents for Mothers Day and birthdays. Anyone who knows the product knows how lovely it is.
I have always been fond of a bit of kitsch! So when I saw these at Camberwell Market this morning I knew they needed to come home with me.
I have had my cousin staying with me this week and like many older baby boomers she is doing our family tree.
I tell you what, fact is more bizarre than fiction! After looking at her tree it turned out I was second cousin to a close friends, sisters husband, even though he came from SA and I came from WA his mother and my father were cousins.
In light of the much awaited Tim Burton film Alice in Wonderland, I thought I would give you a sneak peek of Effie's latest quilt. She is appliqueing images off the gorgeous, Japanese double sided muslin that is in the shop. If you are interested in the class book early as her class fills quickly.
I found this so cute bag in one of my Vintage magazines, thought I would share it. Someone may like to make it. The heading is a great example of how our language has changed and words have different meanings now.
Please join us, as we hope to inspire you through this blog and don't be shy to let us know your thoughts by email as we would love to hear from you.
I hope you enjoy reading this blog, as much as Lynn and staff enjoy posting all the happenings in the shop and around Melbourne, Australia.

This application is a National Stage Entry of PCT/JP2013/007078 filed on Dec. 3, 2013, which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application 2012-272413 filed on Dec. 13, 2012, the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference, in their entirety.
The present invention relates to a visualization device, a visualization method, and a visualization program, which make a data structure, especially an overview of data distribution, graspable to examine preprocessing and an analytical method to be applied in performing data analysis on high-dimensional data.
A data visualization technique is a technique essential for advancing work efficiently in data analysis work. With the development of sensing technology and information management technology, the necessity has increased in recent years where data have become enormous and complicated.
The following scenes are considered as typical scenes of application of the data visualization technique in the area of data analysis: (1) A scene where a data structure is overviewed as a stage prior to analysis, (2) a scene where learning results are interpreted when the data structure is learned as a model by a machine learning technique or the like, and (3) a scene where prediction results are considered when a prediction is made using the learned model.
In the scene (1), there is a method as typical visualization means used to overview the data structure, where after high-dimensional data are compressed into lower dimensions using a multivariate analysis technique such as principal component analysis or multidimensional scaling, the compressed data are displayed on a two-dimensional scatter plots. There is also a visualization technique, called Scatter Plot Matrix (hereinafter referred to as SPM), for arranging, in a matrix form, two-dimensional scatter plots for all combinations of two-dimensional data obtained from the original high-dimensional data. Further, there is a visualization technique, called Parallel Coordinate Plot (hereinafter referred to as PCP or parallel coordinate plot), for arranging axes corresponding to respective dimensions longitudinally in parallel with one another, plotting observed values so that the minimum value will appear at the lower end and the maximum value will appear at the upper end in all the dimensions, and connecting observed values on adjacent axes with line segments.
The principal component analysis and the multidimensional scaling are useful to visualize information indicative of scattering of data points in a multidimensional space while storing the information as much as possible. Further, the SPM and the PCP are useful to visualize a relationship between specific minor dimensions existing in high dimensional space by one diagram as a whole.
Patent Literature (PTL) 1 describes a method of classifying learning data with continuous-valued attributes using a decision tree based on the data distribution feature to make a decision of or change in a model structure easy. In the method described in PTL 1, each node in a generated decision tree is displayed as a scatter plot of an objective function as a data group concerning certain one attribute and an explanatory function as a data group concerning the multiple remaining attributes to make the data distribution feature understandable.
In the principal component analysis, for example, there is a problem that it is difficult to interpret a visualized content depending on the data even in a relatively low dimension. Further, in the multidimensional scaling, for example, there is a problem that the plot itself becomes complicated as the number of data and the number of dimensions increase. Thus, these visualization techniques are not necessarily versatile.
Further, in the method described in PTL 1, attributes displayed as scatter plots are fixed to objective variables and certain one explanatory variable. Therefore, an attribute to be displayed cannot be set for each node. As a result, for example, when data structures existing in high-dimensional data are to be analyzed, the data structures capable of being overviewed by a user (analyst) are limited to some of the data structures.
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a visualization device, a visualization method, and a visualization program, capable of overviewing more data structures as characteristic data structures existing in high-dimensional data to be analyzed when a user analyzes the high-dimensional data.
A visualization device according to the present invention includes: an evaluation index calculation unit which calculates the value of an evaluation index representing a feature degree for each of combinations of a first attribute group and a second attribute group in terms of data on the second attribute group including one or more attributes and conditioned with the first attribute group including one or more attributes among high-dimensional data to be visualized; and a visualization processing unit which generates image information for presenting combinations of the first attribute group and the second attribute group, which are determined to have large evaluation index values based on a predetermined criterion.
Specifically, the visualization device according to the present invention narrows down data having characteristic structures in the high-dimensional data before performing visualization processing. Here, it is assumed that data are given in a matrix form of [sample.times.attribute]. Hereinafter, the attribute is synonymous with the dimension. Next, the visualization device applies visualization processing itself to the data narrowed down. As the method of narrowing down data having characteristic structures, consider paying attention to data on some attributes (second attribute group) conditioned with other some attributes (first attribute group). Here, the presence of multiple combinations of the first attribute group and the second attribute group is assumed. Therefore, it is desired to be able to extract as many combinations as possible from the standpoint of visualization to enable the analyst to overview as many data structures as possible. As the method of enabling the analyst to overview as many data structures as possible, for example, there is a method of defining some sort of evaluation index representing the feature degree of a data structure, calculating a value of the evaluation index for each combination of the first attribute group and the second attribute group, and applying an appropriate visualization technique to a combination of the first attribute group and the second attribute group having a particularly large value. Here, as the evaluation index, for example, a correlation coefficient or a quantity such as degree-of-separation/mutual information when class information is given is considered. The class information is an attribute representing a quantity to be predicted in data analysis. For example, for marketing in CRM (Customer Relationship Management), an attribute representing the purchase behavior of customers corresponds to the class information. Specifically, the degree of separation is the accuracy rate of class classification. When multiple combinations of attribute groups large in evaluation index exist, the visualization device provides an interface to enable the analyst to overview all the combinations as much as possible at a time. As an example of the method for enabling overviewing of all the combinations of attribute groups at a time, there is a method of arranging graphs in a tree view format to be described later.
A visualization method according to the present invention includes: calculating the value of an evaluation index representing a feature degree for each of combinations of a first attribute group and a second attribute group in terms of data on the second attribute group including one or more attributes and conditioned with the first attribute group including one or more attributes among high-dimensional data to be visualized; and generating image information for presenting combinations of the first attribute group and the second attribute group, which are determined to have large evaluation index values based on a predetermined criterion.
A visualization program according to the present invention causes a computer to execute: a process of calculating the value of an evaluation index representing a feature degree for each of combinations of a first attribute group and a second attribute group in terms of data on the second attribute group including one or more attributes and conditioned with the first attribute group including one or more attributes among high-dimensional data to be visualized; and a process of generating image information for presenting combinations of the first attribute group and the second attribute group, which are determined to have large evaluation index values based on a predetermined criterion.
According to the present invention, when analyzing high-dimensional data, a user can overview more data structures as characteristic data structures existing in high-dimensional data to be analyzed.
FIG. 2 It depicts an explanatory diagram depicting an example of a decision tree created based on the five-dimensional data depicted in FIG. 1.
FIG. 3 It depicts an explanatory diagram depicting an example of the output results of a visualization device for the five-dimensional data depicted in FIG. 1.
FIG. 4 It depicts a block diagram depicting the configuration of a first exemplary embodiment of a visualization device according to the present invention.
FIG. 5 It depicts a flowchart depicting the operation of the first exemplary embodiment of the visualization device according to the present invention.
FIG. 6 It depicts a block diagram depicting a minimum configuration of a visualization device according to the present invention.
A first exemplary embodiment of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.
FIG. 1 is an explanatory diagram depicting an example of the results of visualizing five-dimensional data using SPM. Here, a problem of classifying "o" indicative of one sample and "x" indicative of the other sample for the five-dimensional data using SPM depicted in FIG. 1 is considered. When class information is purchase behavior, the sample represents each individual customer. In FIG. 1, scatter plots for any two-dimensional combinations in five dimensions are depicted.
An analyst can overview a distribution of data in any two-dimensional space through the scatter plots depicted in FIG. 1. For example, the analyst can read from FIG. 1 that "o" is concentratedly distributed as relatively large values and "x" is concentratedly distributed as relatively small values in a first dimension (attribute V1). However, it is difficult to read, form the scatter plots depicted in FIG. 1, further information regarding classification information on "o" and "x" at a time.
In the exemplary embodiment, a decision tree is used as a method of narrowing down data. Further, since the classification problem is considered here, a degree of separation between "o" and "x" as an index representing a feature degree is considered.
FIG. 2 is an explanatory diagram depicting an example of the decision tree created based on the five-dimensional data depicted in FIG. 1. The inequalities in the decision tree depicted in FIG. 2 represent branch conditions, and the numbers of leaves represent "the number of o pieces" or "the number of x pieces."
In the exemplary embodiment, a visualization device extracts a dimension in which "o" and "x" are separated best as a node closest to the root of the tree, i.e., as a node closest to the upper part of FIG. 2 in creating the decision tree. Therefore, for example, it can be read from the decision tree depicted in FIG. 2 that the attribute V1 best separates "o" and "x" like the scatter plots depicted in FIG. 1. It can also be read that attribute V2 best separates "o" and "x" in terms of data with values of attribute V1 being 0.02335 or more. Further, it can be read that attribute V3 best separates "o" and "x" in terms of data with values of attribute V1 being less than 0.02335.
Further, in the exemplary embodiment, the visualization device provides an interface as depicted in FIG. 3 as output results to enable these pieces of information on the classification between "o" and "x" to be overviewed at a time. FIG. 3 is an explanatory diagram depicting an example of the output results of the visualization device for the five-dimensional data depicted in FIG. 1. In FIG. 3, three scatter plots are arranged to correspond to the structure of the decision tree depicted in FIG. 2. Each dashed line in each scatter plot depicted in FIG. 3 is drawn in a position corresponding to the left side value of the inequality at each node depicted in FIG. 2.
Scatter plot A depicted in FIG. 3 corresponds to a node with the branch condition being "0.02335<=V1," a node with "-1.227<=V2," and a node with "-0.2746<=V3" depicted in FIG. 2.
Scatter plot B depicted in FIG. 3 corresponds to a node with the branch condition being "-0.2746<=V3," a node with "0.1117<=V5," and a node with "-3.464<=V4" depicted in FIG. 2. In other words, scatter plot B represents data regarding attribute V3, attribute V5, and attribute V4, limited to samples small in the values of attribute V1, i.e., conditioned by attribute V1. In the case of scatter plot B, attribute V1 corresponds to a first attribute group, and attribute V3, attribute V5, and attribute V4 correspond to a second attribute group.
Scatter plot C depicted in FIG. 3 corresponds to a node with the branch condition being "-1.227<=V2," a node with "-1.098<=V4," and a node with "1.868<=V5" depicted in FIG. 2. In other words, scatter plot C represents data regarding attribute V2, attribute V4, and attribute V5, limited to samples large in the values of attribute V1, i.e., conditioned by attribute V1. In the case of scatter plot C, attribute V1 corresponds to the first attribute group, and attribute V2, attribute V4, and attribute V5 correspond to the second attribute group.
Although three scatter plots are contained in FIG. 3, any number of scatter plots may be contained in the output results. For example, the number of scatter plots may be changed according to the depth of the tree, or only scatter plots corresponding to nodes separating "o" and "x" well, i.e., nodes having particularly large evaluation index values may be contained in the output results. Note that the determination as to whether a node separates "o" and "x" well may be made, for example, by determining whether the evaluation index value is larger than a predetermined criterion.
From scatter plot A depicted in FIG. 3, when data are narrowed down to samples taking on large values in terms of attribute V1, the analyst can read that "o" is distributed as relatively large values and "x" is distributed as relatively small values in terms of attribute V2 disproportionately. On the other hand, when data are narrowed down to samples taking on small values in terms of attribute V1, the analyst can read that "o" is distributed as relatively large values and "x" is distributed as relatively small values in terms of attribute V3 disproportionately.
Similarly, from scatter plot B, when data are narrowed down to samples taking on small values in terms of attribute V1 and further large values in terms of attribute V3, the analyst can read that "o" and "x" are relatively separated in terms of attribute V5.
Similarly, from scatter plot C, when data are narrowed down to samples taking on large values in terms of attribute V1 and further large values in terms of attribute V2, the analyst can read that "x" is concentratedly distributed as small values in terms of attribute V4 compared with "o."
Information on the above data structure that can be read from each scatter plot depicted in FIG. 3 cannot be found by the typical visualization means mentioned above. Further, the results depicted in FIG. 3 can be combined with the background knowledge of the analyst regarding data to enable the analyst to develop an analysis policy, such as to exclude some data from the analysis or apply another analytical method to some data.
FIG. 4 is a block diagram depicting the configuration of the first exemplary embodiment of the visualization device according to the present invention.
The decision tree creation unit 102 takes input of data to be visualized and the decision tree parameters from the data/parameter input unit 101. The decision tree creation unit 102 creates the decision tree for the input data as depicted in FIG. 2 according to information on the input decision tree parameters. The numerical values such as "0.02335," "-1.227," and the like in the inequalities depicted in FIG. 2 are an example of numerical values calculated by the decision tree creation unit 102. The decision tree creation unit 102 outputs information on the created decision tree to the decision tree storage unit 103.
The decision tree storage unit 103 stores the information on the decision tree input from the decision tree creation unit 102.
The data/parameter input unit 101, the decision tree creation unit 102, and the tree view-formatted scatter plot creating unit 104 are, for example, implemented by a computer operating according to a visualization program. In this case, a CPU has only to read the visualization program and operate as the data/parameter input unit 101, the decision tree creation unit 102, and the tree view-formatted scatter plot creating unit 104 according to the program. Each of the data/parameter input unit 101, the decision tree creation unit 102, and the tree view-formatted scatter plot creating unit 104 may also be realized by separate hardware.
The decision tree storage unit 103 is realized by a storage device such as a memory provided in the visualization device.
FIG. 5 is a flowchart depicting the operation of the first exemplary embodiment of the visualization device according to the present invention.
As described above, in the exemplary embodiment, data having characteristic structures in the high-dimensional data are narrowed down before the visualization processing itself is performed. Further, in the exemplary embodiment, the tree view-formatted scatter plots created based on the information on the decision tree used to narrow down the data are output so that more characteristic data structures existing in the high-dimensional data can be overviewed at a time. Therefore, when analyzing the high-dimensional data, the analyst can grasp multiple characteristic data structures existing in the data. This enables the analyst to develop a policy as to what preprocessing and analytical method are to be applied.
Further, since the exemplary embodiment focuses on the extraction of conditioned data structures, samples having characteristic data structures can be extracted beforehand as preprocessing in analyzing the high-dimensional data and analyzed separately. In addition, it is possible to provide information used to decide on the number of mixtures and a model in each component when a multipeak model like a contaminated normal distribution as analysis means is applied to data.
In the exemplary embodiment, the case where the visualization device includes the image output unit is described, but the image output unit may not be included in the visualization device. In this case, the tree view-formatted scatter plot creating unit 104 has only to output image information to an external display, printer, or the like communicable with the visualization device. According to such a configuration, the configuration of the visualization device can be more simplified.
Further, in the exemplary embodiment, the case where the degree of separation is used as the evaluation index representing the feature degree is described, but a correlation coefficient may be used. Further, when class information on the data to be visualized is given, entropy may be used as the evaluation index representing the feature degree.
Further, in the exemplary embodiment, the case where the scatter plots are arranged in a tree view format and displayed is described, but the PCP may be arranged in a tree view format and displayed. Further, in the exemplary embodiment, the case where the decision tree creation unit 102 uses a binary tree to create the decision tree is described, but the decision tree creation unit 102 may use a multi-branch tree other than the binary tree to create the decision tree. In this case, the tree view-formatted scatter plot creating unit 104 has only to create tree view-formatted scatter plots according to the structure of the decision tree.
The present invention is applicable to general scenes for discovery of knowledge from high-dimensional data. For example, when a reason for the failure of an industrial product such as a car or a home electrical appliance is identified using machine learning technology from information on the values of many sensors incorporated in the industrial product, the visualization device according to the present invention can be used. In this case, it can be preliminarily overviewed whether there is a characteristic structure between data on the kind of specific reason for a failure and data on the kind of sensor at the stage of examining the analytical method. As another example, when a relationship between personal information on customers and purchase behavior is examined for marketing in CRM, the visualization device according to the present invention can also be used in the same way.
FIG. 6 is a block diagram depicting a minimum configuration of a visualization device according to the present invention. As depicted in FIG. 6, the visualization device includes: an evaluation index calculation unit 11 (corresponding to the decision tree creation unit 102 depicted in FIG. 4) which calculates the value of an evaluation index representing a feature degree for each of combinations of a first attribute group and a second attribute group in terms of data on the second attribute group including one or more attributes and conditioned with the first attribute group including one or more attributes among high-dimensional data to be visualized; and a visualization processing unit 12 (corresponding to the tree view-formatted scatter plot creating unit 104 depicted in FIG. 4) which generates image information for presenting combinations of the first attribute group and the second attribute group, which are determined to have large evaluation index values based on a predetermined criterion.
According to this configuration, information on combinations of attribute groups having particularly large evaluation index values can be presented to a user. Therefore, when high-dimensional data are to be analyzed, the analyst can grasp multiple characteristic data structures existing in the data. This enables the analyst to develop a policy as to what preprocessing and analytical method are to be applied.
According to this configuration, an interface including tree view-formatted scatter plots as depicted in FIG. 3 can be presented to the analyst.
According to this configuration, tree view-formatted scatter plots on high-dimensional data can be created based on information on a multi-branch tree created based on the high-dimensional data. This can deal with more complicated conditioning in creating a decision tree.
According to such configurations, since the evaluation index representing the feature degree of a data structure can be expressed as a numerical value, a comparison of evaluation indexes for each of the combinations of the first attribute group and the second attribute group can be made more accurately.
(6) A visualization device wherein the visualization processing unit 12 outputs image information in which two-dimensional scatter plots corresponding to combinations of the first attribute group and the second attribute group, which are determined to have large evaluation index values, are arranged in a tree view format.
(7) A visualization device wherein the visualization processing unit 12 outputs image information in which parallel coordinate plots corresponding to combinations of the first attribute group and the second attribute group, which are determined to have large evaluation index values, are arranged in a tree view format.
According to such configurations, the analyst can overview more characteristic data structures existing in the high-dimensional data to be visualized at a time. Further, since a combination of attribute groups having a larger evaluation index value is displayed in a position closer to the upper part of the tree view, the analyst can readily interpret the visualized content. In addition, since only scatter plots corresponding to combinations of attribute groups having particularly large evaluation index values can be presented to the user, even when the number of data and number of dimensions of high-dimensional data to be visualized become large, the plots themselves do not become complicated.
While the present invention has been described with reference to the exemplary embodiment and examples, the present invention is not limited to the aforementioned exemplary embodiment and examples. Various changes that can be understood by those skilled in the art within the scope of the present invention can be made to the configurations and details of the present invention.

A server comprising: an interface to a communication network; and processing circuitry, wherein the processing circuitry is configured to: obtain, from a vehicle, over the communication network, and via the interface, lateral distances from objects; compare the obtained lateral distances to a predetermined usable width of a street section; and ascertain, based on the comparison, a parking area of the street section.
The present invention relates to a method for ascertaining a parking area of at least one street section. The present invention further relates to a device for ascertaining a parking area of at least one street section.
Various methods are known in the related art for ascertaining distances of a vehicle from objects with the aid of distance-based sensors (e.g., ultrasonic sensors, radar sensors, video sensors, lidar sensors).
An objective of the present invention is to provide an improved method for ascertaining a parking area of a street section.
According to an example embodiment, the objective is attained by a method for ascertaining a parking area of at least one street section including the steps of: providing a usable width of a street section, the usable width representing a drivable width of the street section between parked vehicles; driving the street section using an ascertaining vehicle and ascertaining lateral distances from objects using an ascertainment device situated in the ascertaining vehicle; comparing the ascertained lateral distances to the usable width; and ascertaining the parking area by way of the comparison.
The method may be used advantageously especially for completing incomplete parking space maps. If the measured usable width (between vehicles at both sides of the driving vehicle) coincides with the known, i.e., expected, usable width, an inference is made that the parking area is occupied. Ultimately, this makes it possible to use parked vehicles to detect parking areas, whereby known methods based exclusively on detecting parking spaces are significantly improved.
On account of the information regarding the usable width of the street section, it is possible advantageously to ascertain parking areas and to provide these for example in the form of a parking space map. This allows for parking areas to be learned quickly, as a result of which it becomes possible to prepare a complete and current parking space map using a relatively small number of passes.
In an example, the method is further characterized by that, in the event of a defined deviation of the ascertained lateral distances from the usable width, which initially indicates an apparent parking area, but which apparent parking area is determined because of a vehicle parked in a second row of the street section (within the usable width), the apparent parking area is discarded. It is thus possible to filter out detected "false" parking areas so that these do not enter the parking space map.
In an example, the method is further characterized by that, in the event of a defined deviation of the ascertained lateral distances from the usable width, an apparent parking area ascertained on the basis of a vehicle of oncoming traffic is discarded. Even in the event of oncoming traffic, it is thus possible to filter out a "false" parking area detected on the basis of the detection mechanism, which is therefore not entered in the parking space map. Ultimately, a type of "deplausibilization of parking space" is thus provided, which is advantageously functional even when the usable width is not represented between vehicles parked on the edges of the street.
In an example, the method further provides for a maximum usable width of the street section to have the following value: 2.times.the maximum range of the ascertainment device+width of the ascertaining vehicle. This makes it possible to take the ranges of different sensor technologies into account such as e.g., ultrasound, radar, laser, etc. In the event that the sensor technology used does not reach the mentioned range, additional localization methods may be used, e.g., using GPS data.
In an example, the method further provides for a position of the vehicle to be detected in the event that a range of the ascertainment device does not cover the entire usable width, the detected position being compared to the ascertained lateral distances. In this manner, the proper functionality of the method is ensured even when the usable width of the street section exceeds the sensor range.
In an example, the method further provides for ascertaining objects, in particular vehicles, from the ascertained distance values. Objects, in particular vehicles, are thereby detected from the ascertained distances, which are determined from defined echoes of the ascertainment device. Other objects, e.g., advertisement pillars, garbage containers etc., may also be detected, which do not enter the parking space map.
In an example, the method further provides for the method to be carried out at least partly locally in the ascertaining vehicle and/or at least partly in a server facility. In this manner, an existing processing capacity may be distributed or utilized in the best way possible.
In an example, the method further provides for the ascertained distance data to be transmitted to the server facility in an automated fashion. This makes it possible to aggregate in the long term a great quantity of historical data, which represent the conditions in a very current and accurate fashion.
In an example, the method further provides for the method to be carried out in real time while the street section is driven or just after the street section is driven in an evaluation phase. This makes it possible advantageously to implement different evaluation strategies.
In an example, the method further provides for the street section to be driven in different directions of travel, the ascertainment data of the drives in the different directions of travel being correlated. Driving the street section in opposite directions advantageously allows for an even more precise ascertainment of the parking area.
In an example, the method is further characterized by that parking areas are ascertained for a defined length of the street section. This makes it possible to produce parking space maps for selectively chosen areas.
According to an example embodiment, the objective is attained by a device for ascertaining a parking area of a street section, the device including an ascertaining vehicle equipped with an ascertainment device, it being possible to ascertain lateral distances using the ascertainment device, a usable width of the street section being known to the device, and a parking area being ascertainable from a comparison of the ascertained lateral distances with the usable width.
The present invention is described below in detail with additional features and advantages, with reference to several figures. For this purpose, each and every of the features presented in any of the specification, drawings, and claims form the subject matter of the present invention. The figures are specifically intended to illustrate the principles that are essential to an understanding of the present invention.
FIG. 1 is a diagrammatic sketch for explaining a functional principle of the method, according to an example embodiment of the present invention.
FIG. 2 is a diagrammatic sketch for explaining an advantageous development of the method, according to an example embodiment of the present invention.
FIG. 3 is a diagrammatic sketch for explaining a deplausibilization of an apparent parking area due to a vehicle in the second lane, according to an example embodiment of the present invention.
FIGS. 4 and 5 are diagrammatic sketches for explaining a deplausibilization of an apparent parking area as a result of oncoming traffic, according to an example embodiment of the present invention.
FIG. 6 is a diagrammatic sketch for explaining a recognition of a parking area, according to an example embodiment of the present invention.
FIGS. 7 and 8 are diagrammatic sketches for explaining a sensor range, according to an example embodiment of the present invention.
In the sense of the present invention, a so-called "usable width" or "drivable driving width" or "drivable driving lane" or "real street width" of a street or a section of a street defines a physical width of the street from curb to curb minus a respective width of a parked vehicle on each edge of the street. It is thus assumed that the usable width is defined only in those areas of the street that are bounded by parking areas. For this purpose, the usable width is ascertained by a pre-filtering process, in which e.g., the walls of buildings are not taken into account as limiting elements of the street section for ascertaining the usable width.
Conventionally, to ascertain the usable width, specific reflection patterns of alternating vehicles and parking spaces are normally used. The ascertainment of the mentioned parking spaces is in this instance bound up with a detection of characteristic echo images, it being necessary, e.g., for there to exist respectively a sequence of [parked vehicle--parking space] or [parking space--parked vehicle] in order to detect the parking space. This requires an extensive number of drives through the street section, it being very difficult to ascertain or verify areas, which are subject to great parking pressure and which are consequently very seldom or never free, as a parking area.
FIG. 1 shows a fundamental functional principle of method for ascertaining a parking area of a street section, according to an example embodiment of the present invention. An ascertaining vehicle 10 is shown, which drives along a street section 1 in the direction of the arrow. On both edges of street section 1, parked vehicles are shown, which occupy parking areas 13 (covered by vehicles 11) of street section 1. Ascertaining vehicle 10 includes an ascertainment device 12 for detecting a distance from objects situated laterally with respect to the direction of travel, ascertainment device 12 including an ultrasonic sensor, a radar sensor or another suitable sensor.
As already mentioned, ascertainment device 12 has advance information regarding a usable width 3 of the street section 1, a manner of ascertaining the usable width 3 and a manner of providing the usable width 3 being ultimately of secondary importance for ascertainment device 12. Ascertainment device 12 furthermore has information regarding that street section 1 has parking areas 13 at least on one side.
When street section 1 is driven, an example embodiment of the present invention provides for the detection of distances from objects, preferably vehicles 11, situated laterally from ascertaining vehicle 10, and for comparing these with known usable width 3. In this manner, as many lateral distances as possible are detected between ascertaining vehicle 10 and parked vehicles 11, at least one measurement being performed laterally essentially at a right angle on the left and on the right of ascertaining vehicle 10. The mentioned ascertainments are ultimately available in the form of limit points 2 of usable width 3, which thus represent "scanning points" of usable width 3. Because of tolerance thresholds, usable width 3 is represented by an arithmetic average value of distances between limit points 2.
In the event that, as shown in FIG. 1, the measured distance within the scope of a defined tolerance threshold (due to measurement or parking inaccuracies) essentially agrees with the previously known usable width 3, an inference is made to the effect that parking areas 13 along street section 1 are occupied. In this manner, it is possible to prepare a complete parking space map within a short time, since, unlike in the related art, it is not necessary that there be unoccupied parking areas 13 ("parking spaces") in order to detect parking areas 13.
FIG. 2 shows a principle of an advantageous development of the method. In this instance, objects, preferably in the form of vehicles 11, are ascertained or modeled from the measured lateral distance values by way of a processing step, which is indicated by tangential limit lines 2a on those vehicles 11 which ascertaining vehicle 10 has already passed. In this case as well, usable width 3 is compared to the distances between ascertained vehicles 11, and from this it is possible to infer parking areas 13.
FIG. 3 indicates a principle of a deplausibilization of a "false parking area" 13a, which is detected in a space behind a vehicle 11a that is parked in a second row and which is discarded for the purpose of preparing the parking space map. To detect a free parking area 13, ascertainment device 12 requires at least one object before or after free parking space 13 in order to generate a signal transition. This can be achieved when there is a clear difference between a currently measured usable width 3a between vehicle 11a parked in the second row and the opposite vehicle 11 and the previously known usable width 3. In this instance as well, there is thus a comparison between the currently measured usable width 3a and the previously known usable width 3, whereby a false parking space is discarded, tagged or otherwise marked as invalid and is thus not taken up into the parking space map.
As indicated in FIG. 4, this may be done analogously also in the case of an individual vehicle of oncoming traffic, the individual vehicle of oncoming traffic and the ascertaining vehicle 10 driving past each other at a defined low relative speed (e.g., approximately 45 km/h). The mentioned relative speed can be determined or adapted in a simple manner using suitable software algorithms. In this case too, there is no detection of a false parking area 13a, which is thus discarded and does not enter into the parking space map.
FIG. 5 essentially corresponds to FIG. 4, a scenario being represented in this case with moving oncoming traffic, in which a larger space occurs between two individual vehicles of the oncoming traffic, which is recognized as a false parking area 13a and is discarded or deplausibilized for the purpose of producing the parking space map.
FIG. 6 shows a "positive comparison" between known usable width 3 and the currently measured usable width 3a, the currently measured usable width 3a being greater than the known usable width 3, and for this reason a parking area 13 being recognized or validated.
FIG. 7 shows a scenario, in which a range of ascertainment device 12 on the left side of ascertaining vehicle 10 is not sufficient for ascertaining the distances from vehicles 11. Using ascertainment device 12, it is thus possible to ascertain only the limit points 2 to the right of ascertaining vehicle 10. In this case, it is possible to use additionally a position detection device (e.g., a GPS position detection device) in order to determine a position of ascertaining vehicle 10 that is accurate to within the centimeter range, and to ascertain in this manner distances from the laterally situated vehicles 11. The following equation applies for the maximum setpoint range d.sub.max of ascertainment device 12: d.sub.max=2.times.maximum sensor range+width of the ascertaining vehicle
If ascertainment device 12 is unable to reach the stated setpoint range d.sub.max, then no comparison can be performed with the previously known usable width 3, and the mentioned position detection device must be used additionally.
FIG. 8 indicates that a range of ascertainment device 12 is increased with the aid of another sensor technology in order thereby to be able to perform the lateral measurements. In this manner, as provided, it is possible to ascertain the limit points 2 on both sides of ascertaining vehicle 10. Depending on the sensor technology utilized in ascertainment device 12, a different sensor range of ascertainment device 12 may be utilized, whereby different usable widths 3 may be ascertained depending on the utilized technology.
The mentioned ascertainments of the lateral distances with the ascertainment of parking areas 13 and the deplausibilization of false parking areas 13a can be performed locally in ascertainment device 12 and/or in a decentralized server facility (not shown). Real-time processing can be provided or processing can be performed subsequent to drives along the street section. A communication device required for processing in the server facility for wired or wireless communication of ascertainment device 12 with the server facility is not shown.
The accuracy and reliability of the ascertainment of parking areas 13 increases with the number of drives through the respective street section 1 since averaging is then performed with an increased number of measured values.
Advantageously, the ascertainment of parking area 13 can already be performed in ascertaining vehicle 10 itself, for example by ascertainment device 12 or a control unit provided for this purpose. Alternatively or additionally, it is also conceivable that all acquired data are transmitted via a radio-based communication device (e.g., based on GSM, EDGE, UMTS, LTE, WLAN etc.) of the ascertaining vehicle 10 to a server facility, the ascertainment of parking area 13 in this case being performed by the server facility, which is normally significantly more powerful.
Preferably, there can also be a provision to perform the described measurements also in a second direction of travel of street section 1 and to correlate or compare them with the measured values of the drive through street section 1 performed in the first direction of travel (not shown). In this manner, it is possible to improve further a data quality of parking areas 13 or an accuracy of the parking space map produced from these.
The method can be implemented advantageously using different sensor technologies, e.g., ultrasonic sensors or radar sensors, which makes it possible to take economic aspects into account.
The method is preferably implemented as software, which facilitates adapting and updating the method.
FIG. 9 shows a basic flowchart of an example embodiment of the method of the present invention. In a step 20, a usable width 3 of street section 1 is provided, the usable width 3 representing a drivable width of street section 1 between parked vehicles 11. In a step 21, street section 1 is driven by an ascertaining vehicle 10 and lateral distances from objects are ascertained by an ascertainment device 12 situated in ascertaining vehicle 10. In a step 22, the ascertained lateral distances are compared to usable width 3. Parking area 13 is ascertained by way of the comparison in a step 23.
In summary, the present invention provides a method and a device for ascertaining a parking area of a street section. A type of "data mining" is performed for this purpose, which while driving carries out a continual comparison of an ascertained usable width with a previously known usable width. Ultimately, this makes it possible to produce parking space maps of high quality in an efficient manner. Advantageously, for recognizing the parking areas, it is possible to use also parking areas that are in an occupied state, and it is not necessary for parking areas to be unoccupied in order to be detected.
Although the present invention was described above with reference to specific example embodiments, one skilled in the art is also able to implement specific embodiments that were not disclosed above or that were disclosed above only partially, without deviating from the essence of the invention.
All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the servant of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. 2 Timothy 3.16-17
My good friend, Pastor Simon Mawdsley and I have just finished our 2nd workshop here in Lusaka, Zambia. We worked this week with a great group of 16 pastors who believe the Scriptures are God’s Words and useful in all of life. However, most of them have had little access or opportunity to be trained how to study God’s Word.
During the training, one of our young pastors, Alick Tembo, took me aside and told me with tears, ‘I’ve been a pastor for over 10 years but no one has ever come alongside me and taught me how to study and understand the scriptures. I honestly feel like I am dreaming because I never thought I would have training like this.’
What a joy and high privilege to be able to come alongside brothers like Alick, Charles, Jeremiah and others, growing in how to dig deeply into God’s Word, carefully observing what is there, not adding what is not there, fighting against the temptation to tickle ears and bending God’s Word.
Pastor Alick Tembo pastors the Vision Bible Church International, a church that he planted in a poor area of Lusaka six years ago. Beyond the good teaching and encouragement of his former pastor, Alick has had no access to bible training. He was thrilled to be chosen as one of the 16 pastors for our PathwaysAfrica workshop in Lusaka.
His church has already noticed the difference the Pathways workshop is having on Alick’s preaching – new power and clarity as he is preaching right from the text of God’s word, keeping his finger in the text. And he’s been sharing what he has learned with other pastors in his community — pastors training pastors!
Alick is married to Dorothy and they have two daughters, Jennifah (14) and Gloria (9). As is typical with most of our pastors, Alick’s church is able to pay him very little. As a result, Alick is a ‘tent-maker,’ working a second job to make ends meet. In his case, Alick sets up a table several days each week on a sidewalk in the busy city center, selling inexpensive cell phones and accessories.
Consider the financial sacrifice Alick and his family and the other pastors are making to faithfully participate three weeks each year in our PathwaysAfrica workshops! And think of how their tent-making impacts their time to study God’s Word to feed their people each week. Pray that local churches will be able to financially support their pastors to free them up full time to shepherd the flock.
Since ‘International’ is in his church’s name, I asked Alick, ‘Does your church reach beyond the borders of Zambia?’ He responded with a smile, ‘Not yet but we will take the Good News of Jesus to the ends of the earth!’ What a vision God has given Pastor Alick.
Pastor Corey Kugle (on the right) and I are on our way to the capital of Zambia, Lusaka, to begin our Pathway training of a group of sixteen Zambian pastors in nine, week-long workshops over the next three years. In growing relationships around God’s Word, we will be coaching them how to better observe, understand, interpret, accurately apply and teach God’s Word. Between each of our nine workshops, each of these pastors will be training other pastors in these same bible study skills and tools. Please pray for Corey and me (and my future teammate, Simon Mawdsley, on the left) as we meet, connect with, and work together Monday May 28 through Friday June 1.
On Saturday, June 2, I’ll travel with my Zambian brother Teddy Kamfwa to the town of Livingstone, Zambia where I will be leading a Pathways pre-training of about 50 local pastors. Our hope is to begin a second Pathways training workshop in Livingstone with a second group of 16 pastors who will then train other pastors. Please pray God will challenge and raise up His group of pastors in Livingstone.
The Sunday after I return from Zambia I’ll be sharing about God’s workings through PathwaysAfrica at Paseo del Rey Church. You’re welcome to join us Sunday, June 10, 9am and 10.35am.
I am so thankful and encouraged by many of you who have joined me with your financial partnership. I’m currently about one third of the way to my goal of $2800 per month. Your partnership will pay rich dividends in these pastors and their families and churches’ lives, and the pastors they train, for all of eternity.
I’d like to invite others of you to invest prayers and finances with me in PathwaysAfrica. Would you prayerfully consider partnering in training pastors who train pastors by committing to $25, $50, $80, $150 a month, or a special annual gift?
If you would like to join my team, go to pathwaysafrica.org and click Support Pathways. Or you can send your gifts directly to Paseo del Rey Church, memo “Pathways”, 900 Paseo del Rey, Chula Vista, CA 91910. All gifts are fully tax-deductible and you will receive a year-end receipt from the church.
Pastor Jean Berchamas invited us to open our bibles to Colossians. As he began to unfold God’s Word, tears came to my eyes. In our first few Pathways workshops in Rwanda, Pastor Jean and the other 15 pastors would open their bibles, read a verse, and then launch into stories and exhortations which had little to do with the passage they said they were preaching.
But now, several Pathways workshops later, Pastor Jean (second from left) and the other pastors were handling more accurately God’s Living Word, faithfully keeping their finger in the text. Stories from their churches told of new joy and obedience as God’s Word was preached faithfully, with clarity and relevance. And these 16 pastors were actively passing on what they were learning to other pastors in Rwanda!
These pastors had not lacked love or passion for Jesus. Rather, like so many other pastors around the world, they lacked access to training in how to study and teach God’s Word.
On July 29, I will transition from Lead Pastor of Paseo del Rey Church and become a missionary from Paseo del Rey. It has been a joy and a privilege to shepherd these wonderful people of Paseo del Rey Church for the past 38 years.
Now, God has opened a new door, and I will be focusing my time and attention on training more pastors who will train pastors in Africa. April and I will continue to live in Chula Vista, but I’ll be in Africa more, 3-4 times a year, 3-4 weeks at a time (April will join me on one journey each year).
I will be leading two different Pathways Training Networks. Each Pathways Training Network consists of 16 pastors who prepare for and participate in 9 one-week workshops that span three years. Being together over the three years provides time to nurture trusting relationships that are the bridge for meaningful and lasting discipleship, growth and training. We are launching our first Pathways group in Zambia in May, even before my transition actually occurs.
Paseo del Rey Church is committed to training pastors in Africa with me, and is generously providing a portion of my support for Pathways Africa.
I’d like to invite you to join my Pathways Africa Partnership team, investing in training pastors, like Jean in Africa. I am asking God for a group of partners like you who will pray regularly and financially support my work each month, or with an annual gift, over and above what you are giving your local church.
You can respond by clicking here. Join me in investing in training pastors who train pastors in Africa. Paseo del Rey Church will receive and administer your financial gifts—there are no administrative fees, and as your gifts are given directly to Paseo del Rey Church they are fully tax deductible.
Your partnership will bring a feast of God’s Word to many as together we team to train pastors who train pastors to study and preach God’s Living Word.
I hope and plan to talk personally with many of you individually over the next few months to share more about investing with me in Pathways Africa.

Gustavo has been running pretty good, when we practice, in our class. He has his ups and downs, but in general I've been happy with how how it's been going. I had hopes we'd do a good job today, we would run fast and clean.
You know that guy Nietzsche? I think he said that Hope Prolongs Whatever Torments Us. Then he went mad and died. Nietzsche was a man blessed with a rad handlebar moustache.
It was a beautiful day. My job was to empty all the trash. That's my thing. I do a good job. You have to get the trash out of the cans without spilling it, and haul it to the dumpster, along with the bags of recycling. Also, always make sure to put a new trash bag in the cans.
Our day started out ok. Gustavo skipped a pole in his second time through the poles in Steeplechase. I didn't see it happen. I was wearing my glasses and everything. He just missed a pole and kept going through. Happened really fast. So we got an E. Everything else in that run was great, so I hoped it was a good way to start the day.
Today, the letter E stands for Entropy and Every Single Run. That Steeplechase E was our best run of the day. The day unraveled to a final fiasco in Masters Standard I'm not even sure I could tell you exactly what happened. It was ugly. There were tunnels. No teeter. Really bad.
i thought entropy was basically heat death from everything spinning out of control... now i know more. thanks to TSD and dictionary.com
and i know how hard those awesome except ____ runs are to fit into the Big Goal Plan. i'm thinking they are not overridden by trash well done but that's a whole new philosophizing opportunity i will let pass.
2Do and I have been working on bars, that is, trying to keep them up. We generally do pretty good at trials, though bars are definitely an issue. Our last trial of 14 runs, he only knocked 2 bars, which is a super improvement, but we had 14 E's. We win!
We could start a club for really fast happy dogs who bring on the demon of chaos on course and don't Q starting with just one little thing in each class and then progressing to I Don't Want To Talk About It. I love watching Gustavo run. I so wish that he completely could get with the program. And Boost, too, but Boost doesn't run full out with such joy the way Gustavo does.

Three cheers for Lea ... she hit it on the nose. This is a very LOL suggestive sign. I wonder what the maker of the sign had in mind :) Good one, Stewart. I would probably have just walked by it without realizing the implication, Ha! Maybe that's because I am getting too close to the upwards direction.
I like the sign, but the mom feeding her baby is absolutely precious. Your being able to bring us such close up and detained captures means so much to one like me who so little about the birding world. Thank you for all the wonderful pictures and explanations you bring me.

I found this yesterday after Boryan posted; it was a link somewhere else on the "Death by Google Calendar" page.
I spent almost two hours playing with this last night. This is a list of the most popular "Web 2.0" applications by popularity and logo. I particuarly like "Rollyo", but the list here is comprehensive. Still wading through it, but some really great ideas.

On the same day that Spotify’s class-action settlement with musicians gets final approval, the company is making a big push to encourage artists to participate on its streaming service – in this case, by offering them a host of educational material to help them get started. The streaming service today is launching its own video series dubbed The Game Plan, which instructs artists on how to get started using “Spotify for Artists,” and the other steps they have to take to make their music available for streaming.
The series includes short videos like: Getting Your Music Up; What Is Spotify for Artists?; Releasing Music; Building Your Artist Profile; Understanding Your Audience; How to Read Your Data; Engaging Your Audience; The Follow Button, Promoting Your Work, and Building Your Team.
In the videos, Spotify attempts to demystify the world of streaming with tips about things like when is the best time to release music, how and why to use listening data, how to upload your music, when to hire a lawyer (irony alert), and more.
The series will also feature interviews with experts, including Spotify staff, industry vets, and artists themselves, including Rick Ross, Little Dragon, Mike Posner, and Vérité.
The idea is that, by sharing this knowledge with the wider community, Spotify will be able to help artists build their careers, the company explains. Naturally, it wants them to build those careers and invest in learning Spotify’s tools – not those from its rivals.
“From successful musicians, to employees who are industry experts, the Spotify community has a wealth of music industry knowledge,” said Charlie Hellman, Head of Creator Marketplace, Spotify, in a statement about the launch. “We want to equip artists at all stages of their career with that powerful knowledge, and make it as accessible as possible.”
The video series’ debut comes at a time when there’s increased competition for Spotify, including from the just now launched YouTube Music streaming service, which takes direct aim at Spotify with a similar price point and the addition of music videos, including harder-to-find performances that are often just on YouTube. Plus, Apple’s new Netflix-like streaming service is rumored to be launching next year as a bundle with Apple Music.
The Game Plan begins as a 10-part video series, but Spotify says there’s more to come in the future.

This works like the LttP randomizer, in that it generates a ROM file with randomized item locations. You can choose between Casual, Speedrunner and Masochist modes, which I assume affects how difficult some of the item locations are. (ie: varia suit in lower norfair or something)
Interesting. I wonder if the algorithm is designed to prevent reaching dead ends and being unable to progress with the items they have.
Maybe not. I got stuck on my first run on Casual, because of no Morph Ball or Missiles. Screw Attack and Space Jump let me access a Power Bomb, but without Morph Ball I could not use it. Maybe I'll double check after I get through this current second run.
This is a fundamental shift in the way difficulties work. Instead of having "Easy", "Normal", and "Hard", the difficulties are now "Casual", "Speedrunner", and "Masochist." If you aren't a speedrunner, don't pick "Speedrunner." If you aren't a masochist, don't pick "Masochist." Easy as that.
Among the changes, now Missile and Super Missile are possible first items in Speedrunner and higher difficulties.
Casual difficulty has the 100 normal items hidden from vanilla Super Metroid. A great intro for those who want to play something a little more random, but nothing tricky.
Ah yeah, I almost forgot about this one. I still intend on getting into it. Thanks for the reminder.
I muttered 'light as a board, stiff as a feather' for 2 days straight and now I've ascended, ;aughing at olympus and zeus is crying
I still haven't checked this out, but there have been a few streams of Super Metroid randomized on Vinesauce recently that reminded me about this and re-piqued my interest in it. I think I'll give it a go sometime this week.
DUDE. I love SM Randomizer, it's great. I actually especially love when the first item is Screw Attack or Speed Booster and not Morph Ball because of how interesting and different it makes the early game.
Just beat a run on "speedrunner difficulty" for the first time in a while. I had to use bombjumps, tricky walljumps (but not CWJ), mockball, spore spawn skip, lower Norfair lava gravity jump, and zebetite skip, the last two of which I had to learn for the run (I had no other way to get into Lower Norfair without space jump!) Clear time was 2:49 IGT.
If we ever get around to doing this competitively, casual is definitely best, because that was too tricky for a race.
I just realized I'd be pretty bad at SM Randomizer because I've never 100%'d that game. I'd be neglecting a -lot- of item locations.
Also, the thing is, on casual and speedrunner difficulty at least, each important key item (like Varia/Gravity, Charge Beam, Speed Booster, etc) shows up in multiple locations, so you can get it in any of those places, but if you got it already, it'll just be replaced with missiles (or in speedrunner, will be empty). Also, protip: you may have to shoot item balls to reveal them; some will be invisible until being shot even if they'd be normally visible.
You should try it. It's not so bad and can sometimes be easier than normal, like if you get screw attack as one of the first items.
Now that we're the hottest site on the internet, let's make it a great round for our fans. I'm sure they'll be impressed by more forethought in posting a new thread to pick games based on lists in the old thread. We're so good at this that we have to handicap ourselves by wasting precious playing time switching between threads.
I can't imagine how bad that's going to be, but you did have it as a choice, so that's your fault really.
@The Amazing Tazy Ten - play Deadpool. Let's get in a Deadpool mood since the new movie is coming out soon.
I'm going to play on both the normal and hardest mode because I remember someone saying that it's a very easy game otherwise. Might try to beat the challenges as well.
@I am nobody , I didn't notice until now that you said to play Kirby's Dream Collection, which is really weird because yesterday I went ahead and played some of Kirby's Dream Collection. Turns out that the only game I did finish on it was Kirby's Dream Land. I guess I got confused since I also own Kirby Super Stars and Kirby 64, so I thought I finished them on here too. I got warped into it and played through Kirby's Adventure. I can feel it now. *cracks knuckles* I got this. I can do this! I'm in the zone baby!
Transistor turns out to have made the truly bizarre decision to neither let you start a fresh new game nor show the tutorials again in NG+. I don't want to manually wipe the file, so I've been stuck playing a game I haven't touched with everything unlocked and it assuming I still remember how to use it all. It's thankfully not a complicated enough game for this to be a real problem, but I don't understand why they did it.
Kirby's Dream Land - I own the original too on Game Boy. Basic. Really basic. Not a strong debut but a debut nonetheless.
Kirby's Adventure - So I've played the remake on GBA but not the original version. I'm honestly surprised this game was on the NES. There's so much crammed into it for an NES game. Wonderful game. Classic.
Kirby's Dream Land 2 - Son of a--this game was a bit harder than I expected, especially getting some of those rainbow drops without losing your power/pet friend
Kirby Super Star - Oh my. One of my favorite games of all time. I've beaten this game so many times and never got tired of it. I rented it back in the day and finished it - 100%. I then played it on an emulator - 100%. No surprise here that I went for 100% too. I even have the remake - Kirby Super Star Ultra - and I also finished that 100%
Kirby's Dream Land 3 - The other Kirby game that I never actually played. I might have rented it way back in the day because some things I vaguely recall. EVERYTHING IS SO CUTE. SO. GODDAMN. CUTE. In the initial stages I thought they made this a baby-game since it felt too easy and you got an extra life every other five minutes. But there's lots more to this game especially with the secrets.
I made it maybe 25 minutes into Transistor. Some of that is definitely down to the forced NG+ wrecking the progression, but the combat is pretty boring and the environmental storytelling wasn't what I remembered.
It feels really weird to bounce that hard off a game I'd previously called a masterpiece, nevermind one from a studio whose other games I still love, but I haven't been able to motivate myself to go back to it even though most of what I've been playing instead isn't even very good.
It's a mindless game with a bunch of funny stuff in it. You either like it or you don't but for me it was a fun time for most of it.
I'm at the endgame boss rush in Cave Story+ but decided not to pick up the only health boost you get so I could nab the three-heart win achievement on Steam too. Maybe that was a mistake.
thanks to FJF I'm out for a couple more months and then I think I'm going to do FFIX on PC because heccin load times (plus, it's been a hot minute since I played last, I would really like to stream it, and soooo yeah)

I was browsing through google trying to find a suitable alcoholic style picture for a work night out i'm planning when I came across the following picture seen on the left. Obviously to protect the little "angels" i've blocked out their faces (but you'll notice i've kept the smile bit in).
What is wrong with our country? That is something I really have to ask myself more and more thesedays. Every human being, agency, organisation, situation, legislation and service is political, in fact politics is why we see this picture today of our youth getting drunk underage and causing a nuisance.
For this blog i'd just like to discuss this picture which shows some awful sights. Firstly we see a littered can in the background, next we see a male just out of shot probably acting as the "lookout" for the cops. Secondly we can clearly see these kids are boozing off big bottles of alcohol - one each. Thirdly it's daylight and finally they're well under the age.
The youth of today really have a warped view on childhood. They assume getting drunk every weekend is all part and parcel of "having a laugh". When I was a kid I used to watch superman, wrestling and the incredible hulk on tv. I remember when fireman sam and thomas the tank engine were amazing to kids and I was lucky if I got the odd bottle of pop on a weekend.
Now we have kids as young as 12 getting drunk in our parks, car parks and on the streets. I really have to ask why the hell is this happening? Why does a lot of my time get spent on chasing youths around the town who run away at the sight of a police vehicle because they are in posession of alcohol? Why are the shops selling them to children? Why is the government just pushing this problem into the "anti-social" bracket and brandishing it off as a police problem?
This certainly is a government and parental problem and not a police one. Surely we can argue since everything has become political, this country has become crap. You wouldn't see youths doing this or behaving in this manner in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or even early 90s really. Look at how many decades that is compared to now? What was different? It's quite simple - the rules were different, authority was respected and the government had humans working in it and not monkeys who are not in touch with real life. We should stop adhering to the liberal European rules, scrap the human rights act and apply common sense to those who break our laws or cause decent people misery in some way.
We've all most likely been there when Mr and Mrs. Bloggs phone up because there's a large group of youths sat outside their house making loud noises and causing general annoyance. We shout up we'll attend and as soon as we turn the corner, the youths are off like a rocket down alleyways, across fences and over back walls leaving a couple of lookouts left until we go. We then result it as youths made off, advised the rest of the party and told the informant that we'll be in the area.
Shortly afterwards, the youths return and the game starts again. Later we arrive again but this time they've drank their alcohol and they're abusive towards us. We lock up a few for public order offences or drunk and disorderly depending on the circumstances, and that ties us up for an hour or so, away from the streets and away from possibly fighting real crime for those who pay taxes.
As we cart off a few, the others have again done their dissapearing act and return to cause further havock because their friends were taken away. Wing mirrors off cars get smashed, car tyres are slashed, fighting between youths start and various other moronic crimes take place. Our other colleagues turn up, the youths again run off or get taken to custody.
The result? Slap on the wrists for the youths (who brag about it the weekend after), paperwork for the cops, no man power for the sergeants, no peace for the residents and their dread of next friday/saturday night when the game begins again.
A little while back I was speaking with a Sgt, whom I have the utmost respect for, and we were catching up on things due to him moving to a different station on my division and one of these catch up chinwags is the result of this next post, I hope it serves caution to all those who may arrive at this situation.
We'll call the Sgt "Eric" for the purposes of the tale. Eric's officers were all tied up in custody as all of them had locked up and would be busy for a couple of hours at least when a report of a prowler in a back garden came through the radio. Eric, being not much of an office dweller, shouted up he would go to the job as all of his officers were tied up.
Eric opens his filing cabinet draw and takes out his body armour, utility belt with appointments and gets kitted up. The Sgt's car keys are taken off the hook and out he flies to the address. Cut to a full search of the back garden, of the area and a negative result; Eric is now in the address talking to the female who phoned the job in.
"So what time do you finish?" she asks, clearly not one bit bothered about the supposid "prowler" now.
Eric said the female was slim, blonde, mid 20s and very good looking, however his engaged fiance was more important to him so he declined saying he was engaged but flattered for the offer.
Eric then offers safety advice in case there was a prowler, which obviously he's doubting at this stage, and then heads back to the station. I'll bet some reading this might be tempted to have taken her up on her offer after work? Well here's the twist...Eric is curious about this female and he puts her details into the local intel system. Intel revealed that she was famous for making allegations against police most notably sexual allegations...
First of all I would like to thank "honest_uncle" who commented in the previous post about me having the wrong image for chief con/commissioner rank. To be honest with you honest_uncle I didn't even notice it myself until you mentioned it. I've now acquired the correct image and swapped it - google is amazing isn't it!?
Well onto my story for today then; I got a phone call from a friend yesterday informing me that he was having a bit of a drinking session at his with a few other of our friends and did I want in. Of course being a graduate in my time, formerly living the life of a University student years back, the answer clearly could not be a no. Cut to 8pm and we're all in the living room, beer in hand, tv on, lazily leaning back on our friends comfy living room sofa chairs.
We're reminiscing about past girlfriends, current girlfriends and recent amusing tales when someone switches on a police reality show, the kind where a camera crew follow British bobbies around whilst they go about their tour of duty. I rarely sit down to watch tv, usually because I find most television either full of insurance/debt adverts or full of unrealistic soaps that middle aged women, eating malteasers, watch. But this didn't seem too bad, I do sometimes watch them when they are on.
Questions were directed to me like a flurry of punches a boxer gives a southpaw fighter in a boxing match. "Can that copper do that?" "Have you been in that situation?" "If that was me i'd have done this, what do you think?" "She's only saying that cos' the cameras are there, am I right?". Suddenly it crept up on me that i'm glad i'm watching rather than being on camera.
The stress each officer must undergo whilst working and being harassed by some journalist, whom is just interested in bloodlust and gore, with a camera must be overwhelming. I watched certain situations each bobby came across and I do have to agree that bobbies on camera turn into mp's debating in the house of commons; a lot of it is unrealistic as to the situations we face.
Lets take one example from this reality show, a male is drunk and screaming at this bobby that he is going to rip his head off if he comes any closer to him. The bobby, who is illuminated by the 10,000 watt camera spotlight on him, has his hands raised and out asking the male politely and calmly to "calm yourself down, alright calm yourself down though", shortly which the male starts getting worse which results in him being wrestled to the floor by a group of bobbies and put in the back of a van. The bobby then ends up walking away and a close up shot reveals he's cut his lip.
In reality as soon as this idiot started screaming and swearing, he would have been pushed away from the officer and told to get back. If he didn't he'd receive a shower of CS incapacitant spray and a free taxi to police ensuite accommodation courtesy of drunk and disorderly or public order etc. So in my opinion, it seems to me that it's even more dangerous going out with a camera crew.
It was interesting to see how colleagues deal with things differently in different forces, but again I don't think its a realistic picture Joe public see's on screen, but who cares about that as long as it gets ratings? After all the bill solves crime in 60 minutes and they don't even use tape recorders in their interview rooms!
I think one of the major issues about being a police officer is the honesty of the witness(es) you are dealing with. If I can keep a straight face when I tell a friend a punchline from a witty joke, in an effort to get that friend to think about it before he realises it's a joke and if I can also tell someone to put down the knife and they can still walk away free and after they do they end up in steel bracelets and carted off to custody, then so can anyone else lie to me.
I think it's often a case of going to every job with a fresh mind and giving that person the benifit of the doubt. The training environment would almost certainly suggest that, following up on that, the training environment would also add that we are there to bring cases before the court not decide who we will help or won't because we suspect them of lying, which I would agree is true. I don't think anyone no matter how experienced as a cop can fully work out what most people we deal with think or were thinking or might be thinking. We just have to stick to the facts, the evidence, the past history and our own common sense to operate and function.
This was a lesson which took me all of my probation to learn, many moons ago, one i'm glad I did learn. I would go to jobs and wonder to myself "is this person telling me the truth or is there something more sinister here?" "I think she's not telling me something here" "I think he thinks i'm stupid" etc...Nowadays I don't really keep an opinion on any job I go to, I just think "well this is the job, lets investigate it and stay neutral" just as required to do so. I do my job properly, I help those who need help and I put the bad guy behind bars for the night.
Then I hang up my uniform in the locker room, shower, get changed into my "civvies" and relax to the radio on my way home or paradise depending on how tired I am.
As for those who constantly tell lies and have a history of lying to the police...well they're another story.
I've finally discovered the secret to wearing simply body armour and a short sleeve shirt in winter. Prior to discovering this secret i've endured many years wearing something extra such as a fleece or hi vis jacket. The secret you ask? A t-shirt under your short sleeve shirt! It works wonders. After close inspection I saw that other colleagues have already been doing this tradition before me...it's like some kind of secret info that I was kept out of.
Another way of keeping yourself warm is to either stick on the vehicle heater, if it works, or to possibly engage in a spot of foot pursuit. Speaking of foot pursuits, this is what this log is about...
Comms finish their general shout for any patrol to attend a report of a male and female arguing on the street. I'm in with a colleague and we decide to head to the location.
We arrive and immediately I can see a female outside an address and a male...who appears to...yep he's running away from the scene and more importantly away from us! We give chase and we're off just like the cap gun for the London marathon, all aiming to run as fast as possible. Over one fence we go, through a broken fence next and we're back out onto open road.
My colleague has clearly not been sacrificing enough time at the gym and shouts "i'll go bring the car round" running off back towards the car, i'm assuming he'll be pole vaulting over a fence again! I'm fine for stamina and i'm not tired either, and mr. moron is heading into a cul-de-sac.
At this point i'm on the radio directing further patrols to the area and also directing my colleague, who is driving our police vehicle in the background. I can hear the police vehicle's engine in the background, some wheel skidding noises, he's almost at the location! While at the same time i'm sprinting down into this badly lit cul-de-sac...and he's disappeared!
Well he couldn't have gone past me and I know he hasn't had enough time to get ahead of me...he's definitely gone to ground hiding somewhere. Colleague pulls up and he turns the engine off, while we listen for anything suspicious...and immediately I can hear some slight scuffling nearby.
The torch illuminates the area where the noise is and low and behold mr. moron is trying to scale over a garage roof. Off we go again, I manage to get there and grab the male round the hips and bring him to the floor gradually. We've detained him until we can find out what offences might have been committed and/or if he is wanted.
We check him with our communications room and he is known on our systems but not wanted by us. Another patrol has gone to the female to ascertain A - if she is ok and B - if the male has assaulted her or broken the law in some way.
Turns out the male had assaulted her and was promptly arrested, cautioned and handcuffed. He then was given 5 star accomodation at our police en-suite rooms known to many as "police custody". I think that sgt who dislikes the word "shut up" is on too...great.
A few hours of paperwork await myself and colleague now...it's a wonderful life we have sometimes eh?
Each time someone is reported missing from their place of residence, a report needs to be generated and the person is risk assessed against various competancies. The result is that the missing person (misper) gets allocated into one of three categories: high, medium or low risk.
High risk mispers are generally those deemed to be vunerable in various ways from age to disibility. Unfortunately some mispers really do take a rise out of the police. Take a persistant 11 year old misper, who has a criminal record longer than your arm. He is known for street robbery and criminal damage, standing at a mere 4 feet 10 inches tall and weighing in at around 7 stone max.
For the sake of simplicity we'll call him X. X lives in a childrens home, commits crime almost monthly and continually gets a little slap on the wrist. To further the annoyance, X likes to leave his childrens home to go across to the other side of my force to stay with his friends. He then gets reported as a high risk and alarm bells start ringing force wide for him.
He gets found each and every time in the exact same place, every weekend and sometimes various weekdays too. Each time he is then rewarded with a free taxi ride home, meaning officers being allocated the job of driving a few miles to pick X up, take him back and then fill out an unnecessary report.
The report asks some strange questions which we have to ask the missing person such as "have you been a victim of crime while you have been away? have you committed any crimes while you have been away? do you think you will do this again?" Something which muggings here has had to fill in many times for X, even though I know where he will be, I know what he will say as does all of my colleagues who too have picked X up and taken him home from time to time.
So, in short, if you want a free taxi home - get someone to phone 999 and report you missing and make it sound like you are a complete menace to society. Please wait up to ten minutes though, as we will try and get to you as quickly as possible, we wouldn't want you being cold as you have to get home don't you?
They say that one important skill that comes with experience is having a "double ear", this means being able to hear comms shout you up or know what all of your colleagues are dealing with from radio transmissions, and at the same time be doing something else like writing a witness statement up etc.
Another important skill that comes with time in is having the coppers "eye". Some bobbies might call it the coppers nose but I think that's an inaccurate metaphor. This story centres about me using such a skill that I've developed over time.
I'm in a vehicle and on afternoons, it's just gone dark and I'm driving down a long main road. The clock appears to be stuck because I still am 6 hours away from finishing and it's dead...Well apart from that car that's just taken a sharp left around the corner...hmmm I think I'll follow that.
I turn off and head down the road and can see it turning left again into a pub car park, it stops in a parking spot whilst I pull up behind it. A quick glance shows that there are 4 on board, the driver has just got out of her car and is approaching my vehicle.
I get out and speak to her asking if she's lost or if everythings ok, because in fairness anything could have caused her to take a sharp turn away and it's always nice to be polite I think. I take a look at the tax disc and it's out of date and the driver isn't sure if she has the right insurance apparently?
I sit the young lady in the back of my car while I speak with her. The PNC on the car comes back in her name, insured too in her name. Ok no problem there, just the issue of tax - she provides me with a receipt showing she has just bought a new tax disc...the usual lecture on "failing to display valid tax is still an offence" is mentioned by myself but I'm prepared that its the end of the matter. Here's where the eye comes into play.
As I'm letting her out of my car I see something drop out of her back pocket...looks at first glance like a snap bag. She quickly picks it up and walks away.
I go out and speak to her "friend" who agrees that it is hers but she only bought it 5-10 minutes ago from someone she didn't know. Somebody is lying their backside off and I'm starting to get a bit pissed off now, if there's one thing I dislike it's liars and I meet too many of them in my job.
Unfortunately there was a very small amount of the stuff in the snap bag, which warrants a street caution due to the fact that the girl who had it in her pocket hadn't been in trouble before as I PNC'd her. Cue her getting a long chatting to and a street caution for possession of cannabis (class C drug).
Whilst it's not the crime of the century it just shows that the coppers eye is fully operational and the young female has been given a chance to right her ways...but I doubt it will have made any difference and the drug taking will continue away from police knowledge.
What the female had trouble understanding was that the cannabis was found on her, not her friend and that it didn't matter if it wasn't hers or not she was found with it in her possession. I think that's my discretion used up now for a while because the sanctioned detections are calling...

The requirements to join the clan is posted in the application forum which you can get to by clicking Here.
Everyone who meets the minimum requirements can join the clan, unless they are an applicant has previously been banned from the clan on any character, they will not be allowed to join at all or until their ban duration has finished.
If a clan member has a valid reason why an applicant should not join Peacefull the member should private message a member of the staff (staff list Here), if the staff decide that it is an appropriate reason it will be discussed and action will be taken. Valid reasons include that they have left the clan earlier on bad terms, or if they are a known to have broken any Jagex rules.
This clan does not require exclusive membership. This means that you may be a member both of Peacefull and of another clan. Please note that most pking clans do have exclusive memberships. Usually that applies to the person not the account, which means you cannot join Peacefull with a lvl 3 skiller and have a pker as a member in those clans.
We, at Clan Peacefull wish our members to be active in the clan. Everyone that hasn’t visited the clan in the last 3 months (91 days) without a valid reason will be deleted. The stand down period of 5 months will automatically be in place.
Members who know they will be inactive should create a thread or private message an active staff member (staff list Here), who will add a user feedback regarding the inactivity period.
The quitting thread should be a peaceful one, no flaming allowed. A reason for why they are quitting is encouraged to be posted, as long as that reason isn't towards other members or similar reasons that easily leads to flaming.
If a member post their decision to quit, that decision is final and their account will be deleted when an administrator reads the post. For this reason members should consider if they really want to quit before making a post.
Quitting threads will be closed by the staff who first sees the post and deletes the account. This is done both to avoid flaming, and since the quitting member no longer can read any replies in the thread.
Members are not allowed to make threads stating that they may be quitting. Threads with topics such as "Thinking of quitting", "Maybe quitting" etc, will be locked by the staff. This does not count for quitting Runescape.
The reason for this is that such threads cause unrest in the clan, and they may also be mistaken for a quitting thread resulting in an administrator deleting the account when that was not the intention of the member starting the thread.
If a member feels the need support, that support should be sought by talking to other members in game, through PM's or similar methods.
The reason for this is that people quitting and rejoining cause unrest in the clan, and it is also meant to discourage members from quitting the clan without thinking it through properly first.
The stand down period is tied to the person, not the Runescape character. People who quit the clan on one of their characters are not allowed to join the clan on another character until after the stand down period. (5 months)
Members or Alumni that have quit the clan and want to join the clan again after the stand down period will need to fill out the application forum again. Former members of clan Peacefull that wish to rejoin, however, are over the maximum combat requirement of 30 will have to meet the following:
If you're a former member of clan Peacefull and wish to rejoin as an alumni rank you can only join on the account that you were originally a member in Peacefull with.
Members who want to change membership from one character to another, such as from an old clan alumni character to a new lvl 3. The user needs to make a new application with the application lay out from (Here! and indicate that a character change is occurring. The character should meet our current requirements which can be found Here!
Clan memebers that decide to level their combat past our maximum requirement of level 30 combat will no longer qualify for 'membership'. In order to keep people who have become friends and who still have a lot of knowledge about being a low level skiller on our forums, we have the rank of alumni.
Members who have been a member of the clan for at least 5 months when they level combat (above 30) will be given the rank of alumni. Those with the rank alumni will still be able to use the forum and will still appear on the clan highscores under the alumni section. Members that have leveled above the maximum combat requirement before being in Peacefull for 5 months will have to leave the clan.
Former members of clan Peacefull that wish to rejoin, however, are over the maximum combat requirement of 30 will have to meet the following:
If you are over 30 combat and have been in Peacefull for 5 months or over you should private message an Administrator (staff list Here) to get your rank changed.
As I'm sure that you all know you are able to change your display name on RuneScape, which is also the name you highscore with once you change it along with the RuneScape official forum. So to help Peacefull, the staff have come up with the idea of allowing name changes once every 3 months (91 days). We have chosen this amount of time to limit the amount of changing that will occur as it could cause a lot of confusion if it happens often.
Please take note that all username changes must meet the Peacefull requirements otherwise it will not get changed. We will highscore the name you wish to be changed to to make sure it does meet the requirements, if it doesn't the name change will not happen.
Also it is important to know that the staff will be keeping a record to amount of changes a user has had and the duration between each. If it hasn't been 3 months since your last change the name change will be denied and you will have to wait.

Spring cleaning can be very tedious, physically demanding and very stressful at times. To make things a little easier, we have a few tips that will help you have a clean and organized home any time of the year.
Get Rid of Dust: When dusting the house, move around each room in a circle starting with the highest points as you work your way down to the floor. The best tools to use to get rid of dust from your house and leave it thoroughly clean include Swiffer dusters, air purifiers as well as vacuum with sealed HEPA filters.
Clean the Kitchen: Clean kitchen cupboards and fridges thoroughly and make sure they are properly organized. Discard canned goods and any other items that are past their date of expiry.
Put away linens: During springtime, you will need to put away heavy quilts and blankets and replace them with lighter-weight bedding. Before storing the bedding, be sure to thoroughly wash and dry it. If you don’t clean them properly, body oils that accumulated on them during usage will attract moths and insects. After making sure that they are dry, store them in zippered bags, under-bed boxes or vacuum seal storage bags to protect against insects and save space. For extra freshness, insert cedar or lavender sachets where you have stored them.
Start up Your Dehumidifier: Make sure that your dehumidifier is properly cleaned and it is in a good working condition and then run it in a partially underground room or a humid basement. This will eliminate dampness during the spring season which causes mildew.
Clean Carpets: Make sure you clean the carpet immediately the spring mud season is over. Ensure that they are vacuumed thoroughly, and then shampoo them with a spray foam or powder. You can also rent a steamer from a hardware store near you and use it to do an even deeper clean on the carpet. This is a must do for spring cleaning.
Clean Shower Curtains: Whether your shower curtains are made from plastic, vinyl or fabric, toss them in the washing machine to get rid of all the soap scum, shampoo as well as mildew. These elements build up during the usage of the curtains and the perfect time to remove them is during spring cleaning.
Clean Dirty Faucets: Wipe cloudy faucets with a damp cloth and then swab with vinegar. Soak a paper towel or cloth with vinegar and then wrap it around the faucet. Wait for about an hour and then remove the wrappings. Give the fixtures a final rub using a fresh towel.
Make your house sprinkle with spring cleaning tips, additionally search your local house cleaning services on home improvement portals and get assistance from them.

InfoStrat president James Townsend's thoughts on digital transformation, marketing automation, customer relationship management, Microsoft Dynamics 365 (formerly CRM), government contracting, customer service and more. For breaking news, follow me on Twitter @jamestownsend and for more depth see the InfoStrat website at www.infostrat.com
Recently I have been working with federal agencies that are adopting commercial customer service techniques for helping government workers be more productive.
The new trend I am seeing is to add self-service functions to traditional help desks. Government workers are telecommuting more frequently, and for some agencies can be scattered around the country or around the world, leading to challenges in call center coverage.
Younger government employees in particular are often more comfortable searching online than picking up the phone to call a help desk. They expect from their government agencies the same kind of customer care that is offered by companies.
Publish FAQs and Troubleshooters on websites and intranets. By providing step-by-step instructions, you can forestall some help calls and provide service even when the help desk is closed. You can seed the FAQs by analyzing historical trouble tickets and identifying those that are both common and can be resolved without intervention by another person such as a network administrator.
Organize your knowledge base. The answer is out there, but it may be difficult to find. Search engines are part of the solution, but creating a visible taxonomy (set of categories) for topics can make it much easier for users to navigate to the right web page or document.
Treat employees like customers. If you adopt a mindset which is similar to a commercial company, you can measure and reward behavior that improves employee satisfaction.
Deflect calls. Phone calls to a help desk are one of the most expensive types of support, and sometimes you can avoid them by providing information as the customer requests help. For instance, an online form can ask the employee for the problem type, and show links to possible solutions.
Allow multiple paths to support. Employees appreciate options of different ways to get support at different times. Some people have strong preferences for a particular support channel, while others will use many. For instance, when I interact with my phone company, I have used phone, email, live chat, and knowledge base searches depending on the issue at hand. Live chat is especially good when you need to communicate a computer problem and describe what is on your screen. Sometimes email is best when I want to "fire and forget" because I need to move on to another task.
In an earlier post, I wrote about Microsoft's new Employee Self-Service Offering brings this approach to customers. A white paper "Justifying Knowledge Management in Customer Service" by CRM analyst Esteban Kolsky is available.
I expect this trend to continue in order to enhance productivity and retention of government employees despite budgetary pressures.
The Digital Accountability and Transparency Act enacted in May 2014 calls for making spending data available in open, standardized formats to be published online. It is a continuation of transparency initiatives and lessons learned with experiences such as grants.gov, the 2009 economic stimulus under the Recovery Act and the spending site USASpending.gov.
Government grantees will have significant new administrative responsibilities. Many organizations that were tracking grants in spreadsheets or documents will have to adopt more sophisticated automated grant management systems such as Microsoft Grants Manager to keep up with reporting rules.
For profit companies will lose some privacy as a result of this law. Grant recipients will be required to disclose information including officer salaries.

Trend-setting restaurants, Northwest cookbooks, local food news and the people who make them happen.
In today’s paper I wrote about FareStart, Seattle’s much-applauded not-for-profit culinary training program. I recently volunteered my services there as a waitress at one of their frequently sold-out weekly “Guest Chef Nights.” If you’ve never been, it’s a screaming deal: only $24.95 for a three-course meal. I encourage you to check it out. Ditto for weekday lunch, another enormous value where you can eat good and do good all at the same time.
During Guest Chef Night, dinner is prepared by some of our city’s finest, in concert with FareStart students and staff. And it was here that I met Seth Caswell, president of Seattle Chef’s Collaborative and late of Stumbling Goat Bistro:
Later that evening, Seth told me about his plans to open his own restaurant, Emmer, ETA next spring. And though it’s not a totally done deal, he’s got his eye on South Lake Union. This was his third guest-chef appearance at FareStart, where he procured the local ingredients donated for tonight’s dinner. Those included Full Circle Farms greens and River Valley Ranch goat cheese; Anderson Ranch lamb; Blue Bird Grains emmer; and dessert made with Empire ice cream, peaches from Rock Island Orchard and puff pastry from Columbia City Bakery.
At the end of service, volunteers (whose tips go directly back to support FareStart) ate the same three-course dinner the paying guests did — though we ate our cafeteria-style, downstairs in the brightly-lit student dining room. But after dinner we hung out at the communal table in the restaurant, enjoying a glass of wine and one another’s company:
I was especially impressed with my sauvignon blanc from SaintPaulia Vintners, sold to customers by the glass or bottle and poured here by volunteer “wine guy” Tim Hicks:
Maybe that’s because I got to drink it in the company of winemaker (and regular volunteer) Paul Shinoda. That’s Paul on the right, below, wearing glasses, standing alongside his friends from St. Luke’s “Grub Club” — some of whom were “newbies” here, as I was:
Hanging out with my friends after work was one of the things I loved most about waiting tables. Today Seattle’s late-night dine-and-drink options are endless, but back in my day that was far from the case. Back then you pretty much had 13 Coins, Sea Garden and the Dog House. But those of us who working at the city’s fine-dining venues inevitably ended up at the bar at Campagne where, come 1 a.m. on a Friday, we’d be eating country pate, drinking eau de vie and hanging from the rafters.
I was thinking about just that on Monday night, when I shared a bottle of rose and these incredible duck-fat-fried potatoes with my friends Chris and Jack in the courtyard at Campagne, in celebration of Chris’s birthday:
Chris was pretty impressed when we were joined, at a nearby table, by a famous actor whose name I can’t recall. But I was more impressed to be dining in the company of chef-exec Daisley Gordon, who has also been a guest-chef at FareStart, seen here on a “busman’s holiday” with his wife, Shelley:

When Public Health Seattle-King County inspectors came to call at Skillet Street Food Monday night, they were not amused. The traveling Airstream parked near Safeco Field during the Mariner’s game was unpermitted. What’s more, Skillet was cited for several other red-flag offenses, and when the email alert “Food establishment closures in King County” went out with Skillet’s name on it today, the blogosphere exploded with the news. “I wonder,” chef-owner Josh Henderson said, “If a taco truck got shut down, would it be on all the blogs?” Not likely.
But Skillet ain’t no taco truck, as you know from reading this blog. And perhaps you’ve seen the love given Henderson’s “rock star of a burger” in this month’s Seattle Metropolitan cover-story — and on TV. Or the ink given to the street food-sensation recently in the Stranger. There’s a reason everyone’s crazy for Skillet: the food is superb, and the price is right. So what prompted the alert?
“We have one trailer not fully approved,” explained Henderson as he readied for tonight’s game. “The original trailer people see every day was having some mechanical issues, so we were forced to bring out the one that’s not approved.” Forced? “We signed a contract with the Mariners for the season, saying we’ll be out in that lot.” It was a choice between not operating and potentially having a breach of contract, he said, or not having a permit for the night and hoping they could get away with it. “We made a bad choice.”
The Skillet trailer opened at 5 p.m. Monday evening and closed at 6, according to Henderson. “We didn’t even serve any food. We went back on Tuesday and operated as normal with a permitted truck, and Wednesday they came back and re-inspected us and gave us the official go-ahead. They’ll come back next week and inspect us again.”
This isn’t the first time Skillet’s run afoul of the law. “We were shut down when we first started,” said Henderson. The reason? “We were operating a non-permitted trailer.” Now fully permitted, that trailer’s been up-and-running for more than a year, tracked down by fans all over town and making the national press sit up and beg for bacon jam. You’d have thought he’d learned his lesson the first time, but apparently not.
“We’re a young business. We’ve invested money. We’re struggling to pay bills. We don’t have deep pockets and large investors. When it comes down to paying payroll and operating a business, sometimes these risks are outweighed by other stuff. That’s the reality.”
Henderson sounded pretty glum today knowing that Skillet’s reputation is being scarred by this week’s health-department call-out. He’s concerned about the visibility of the red-flag issues cited, including the potentially hazardous foods at unsafe temperatures (“we were holding them on ice”) and the unavailability of hot water: things that would make many customers see red, too.
“I don’t fault the health department,” Henderson said. “It was our decision, our choice and unfortunately we made a wrong one.” But he does feel uncomfortable knowing that the health department’s closure alert remains online and “Skillet closed” may be the first thing potential diners see when they Google his business in hope of tracking down the famous Airstream. “We actually voluntarily closed [the unpermitted trailer]. We shut down for the evening when they came by. But none of that stuff gets talked about.
“I’d appreciate it if the site said, `They made a mistake, these are the actions we asked them to fix. They fixed them. We went back to re-inspect Wednesday and they’re in full compliance with the health department.'” Instead, “it may take seven days for them to take that notice down. It’s like getting flogged in the town square and everybody walks by you and sees you in shackles and laughs.”
Tonight, with the blessing of Public Health Seattle-King County, Skillet is serving street food outside Safeco Field from 5 p.m. till first pitch, and they’ll be there Sunday afternoon (throwing over their regular gig in West Seattle). You can follow Skillet via their Website, but hopefully not via this one.

There's a lot of virus like programs being passed around that says due to a computer virus, you have to delete some files and restart your computer, DON'T DO IT!!! These are malicious prank emails that spread like a virus that automatically sends emails to everyone in your address book "Written by you". Deleting these files usually makes your system so unstable that you have to format your hard drive and reload windows. Check at the Symantec-Norton web site for hoax info on their web site here: http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/hoax.html There are fake "Microsoft emails" that come with a file as an attachment that says to have to install it, DON'T! We don't send those types of emails. Instead, tech support will tell you where you can get the files and then you can download them. On very rare occasions, WITH YOUR APPROVAL, we could send a file but you would have "control #" and you would be advised on the phone about it.
Some of you have asked us how to stop saving your "sent messages". Here’s how to do it, BUT that means you’ll no longer be able to see or re-read what you sent. We do recommend that you delete your sent emails and then delete the deleted ones at least once a month to keep your email program fit and trim. Microsoft Outlook (MO). Open MO and then click on the TOOLS tab, then chose OPTIONS tab. Then, on the PRESENCES tab, click on the EMAIL OPTIONS tab. UNCHECK the save copies of sent messages box. Then click APPLY and OK. Close MO and this change will start the next time you use MO. Microsoft Outlook Express (OE). Open OE and choose the TOOLS tab then OPTIONS. On the SEND tab, uncheck the box to save the sent messages. Click APPLY and OK and close OE. This change will apply the next time you open OE.
Here’s a trick to help keep you online longer if you are using a dial-up connection. Most Internet providers disconnect your dial-up connection after 15-20 minutes of no activity from or to your computer. (DSL or Cable Modems, or Wireless connections don’t need this to stay connected but you’ll receive your emails faster). With MO, click on the TOOLS tab then OPTIONS. Click on the MAIL SETUP tab then make sure there’s NOT a check in the SEND IMMEDIATELY box. Then click on the SEND-RECEIVE tab. Change it time to send receive email WHILE ON LINE to 5 minutes. Then click CLOSE, APPLY & OK. Close MO and this will apply the next time you open MO. For OE, Click on the TOOLS tab and on the GENERAL tab, change it to check for new messages every 5 minutes. Make sure there’s a check in the box to send receive messages at start up. Close OE and this change will apply the next time you open OE.
For those of you who are using Microsoft Outlook Express 6 email program and have found that, either you can’t download or open attachments, here’s a fix. Open OE 6 and click on "Tools" then "Options" then "Security" and uncheck the box that say not to allow attachments. Click apply and ok. Then close and reopen OE 6 for the change to take effect.
Do you have several email addresses, one for each person in your home, one for your personal email, and one for your business, or even if you created one just to give out on the web to get info, and you want to keep them separate in your in-box, try this:
First in all programs you have to create another in-box folder with that person's or business' name. In Outlook Express 6, you have to highlight that email in the in-box and then select "Message, create rule from message" just select the boxes as needed to forward an incoming email that’s addressed to "XYZ" into folder called "XYZ". This way all incoming emails are automatically sorted out based on the rules you create. If you can’t get off someone’s email list, then choose "Message" and then "Block Sender" Not sure how many blocked senders you can store on the list so use the "Opt-out" link that usually on the bottom of the emails. This way you don’t have to create "Identities" in the Outlook Express program.
Click on an email message in your Inbox that's from someone who's important to you. Now click on the Tools menu and click the Organize command.
In the line that says "Create a rule to move new messages", select the from option. In the box to the right of this, you'll see the name of the person whose email messages you want to organize. Just to the right of this, click the down arrow to put the message into the folder you created for this person's email.
Click the Create button. All the mail from that person will be moved to the new folder. You can create additional rules to put mail from other people in the same folder, or you can create separate folders for each sender. Note that if you belong to mailing lists and want to sort list mail into folders this way, you'll probably need to filter by the "to" field instead of the "from" field. It takes just a few days to get the folders and email rules you need to get almost all your important mail organized into folder. Try it out and see.
Do you send out a lot of emails, and you want to have a way to take charge of your address book? Try this. Create "Groups" such as: Family, Friends, Clients, etc. In Outlook Express, open your address book, then select "New" then "New Group" and give the group a name such as Family, Friends, Clients, etc. Then select the members to add to this group. In Microsoft Outlook, open your address book, select "New Distribution List" then ok. Give this group a name as above. Then click on "Select Members" to add them. Put new ones in using the "Add New" button. The original email list will still be there, just when you want to send an email to a group of people, just sent it to that group at one shot, rather than addressing it to each person individually.
Have you noticed people listed in your address book that you don't know? Click on tools, then options. Select the "Send" tab and "uncheck" the box that says, "Automatically put people I reply to in my address book". If you're going to send an email to a lot of people and you don't want everyone to see the other email addresses, and then use "Blind Carbon Copy". On the email you're going to send, click on the "TO" button. Select one person in the "TO" box and place the rest of them in the "BCC" box.
Would you like to change your out-going emails to a different style of lettering and font size? How about adding a background photo to it? Try this: In Outlook Express, click on "Tools" then "Options" and then "Compose". Set your lettering and font size and apply it. Create your wallpaper by checking the "Mail" box in the stationery section and then select it. In Outlook 2002, click on "Tools", then" Options", then "Mail Format". Make changes in "Stationery and Fonts" and apply it. Add wallpaper by using the "Stationery Picker button" and apply it. You can also import your own photo if you want to. REMEMBER by adding color, wallpaper photos and sounds you're making your emails larger in size to transmit and receive. Some email accounts have maximum file sizes and if yours exceeded the amount allowed, they'll be rejected and set back to you.
Do you forward emails to others and hate seeing all of the other email address above it? SO does 99.9% of us! When you forward an email, forward on what you want to send out NOT the original email. Ever notice that you get an attachment that has 3 or more icons to open? After you select to forward the email, left click your mouse and hold down the button and drag it over the email addresses etc that you want to delete or edit out, then hit the delete key on your keyboard. This will make the new email smaller in size and faster to send and receive.
Would you like to subscribe to "News Groups" but your ISP doesn't offer a newsgroup server? Try using "msnews.microsoft.com" with out the quotation marks by adding it to your email program accounts.
Would you like to know how to get rid of those right-pointing "arrows" when forwarding messages in Outlook Express? Here's the secret:
If you are having trouble receiving your emails then try this: Send your self a test email. If you can send and receive it, then the problem is not with your computer its your ISP email server. I would then call your ISP and ask them to check your email account. Some ISP's have a maximum amount of emails or mb in size that can be received. If you have one or more that exceeds that amount, your email stops. They can delete one or all of your emails. Another way to check is, to log onto this web site and you can see and delete the emails you don't want. The ones you don't delete will be available to download as usual. NOTE: this might not work with "Web Based Email Programs" such as AOL, Hotmail, MSN, Juno, Yahoo, etc. Go to: www.mail2web.com . If that doesn't do the trick, then open your Outlook or Outlook express email program and delete your email account(s). Close the program and re-open it and then recreate your account(s). And try it again. If you don't know the correct settings to insert, contact your ISP Tech Support for help. Sometimes this "script file" gets corrupted.
Are you receiving emails with web page address or links in your Outlook Express that you can't open? Check out this Microsoft article for help.
Is your Outlook Express having trouble showing the "HTML" windows in your emails? (White box with a red X in the corner). Check Microsoft's fix here. For Outlook, click here.
Are you receiving emails with attachments similar to "love notes.eml" that your Outlook Express 5.5 or 6 can't open? Try this fix from Microsoft. Click here. Or download the new Internet Explorer off Micososft's windows update page.
Does your Outlook Express 5, 5.5, 6.0 in Windows 2000 and XP fail to save your email password? Click here.
If you use Microsoft Outlook as your email program, make sure it’s not set to respond to spam request. There are some spam email that has an auto reply feature in it so when it comes to a good or current email address, it tells the sender.
Every email address must contain the @ symbol, so you can use that to create a rule for messages with no address in From or To.
Under Conditions, select "where the From line contains people" and "where the To line contains people".
Warning! If a message is sent to you with your address in the BCC field, it is quite possible that the TO line will be blank, and so this rule would remove that message. If you frequently receive such mail, you should not filter on "Where the To line does not contain".
Email viruses are created to use the “auto open” feature in Outlook or Outlook Express. This way you don’t have to open the email to release the viruses. Last year Microsoft announced that they identified a way that someone could hid a virus inside of a jpeg picture you’ll receive in an email. (That just gave people something new to try that they probably never though of). Here’s how to turn of the “Preview Pane” in Outlook and Outlook Express and the “Reading Pane” in Outlook 2003:
Click the apply and ok buttons. (Whenever there is an apply button, you should click on that first before the ok button).
When you want to be able to only receive email from specific people, it's called "white listing." You can create a white list in Outlook Express by using its Message Rules function. Here's how:
Add the people from your address book that you wish to allow to send you mail, then click OK to close the address book.
Now under "Select the Actions for your rule," either check the box that says "Delete it" or, if you want to be more cautious, create a folder called Quarantine and check "Move it to the specified folder." That way, you can check the messages to be deleted in case there is mail there that you want to get.
Even with leading spam detection, there is no foolproof way to prevent spam. There are a few steps you can take to avoid spam:
1. Avoid posting your e-mail address in a public place (if you need to provide you can always use the "dot " instead of the actual "."
2. Read privacy information carefully when completing online forms that request your e-mail address, and exercise your choice Use multiple e-mail addresses
3. Do not open or reply to e-mails from unknown addresses and never open attachments unless you the person who sent it
Never click on a link from within a spam e-mail message, even to request “removal” from their mailing list, as this verifies your e-mail address as valid and will increase the amount of spam you receive
4. Turn off your e-mail program's ability to “preview” e-mail messages – spam e-mail messages often have links embedded that report back to a Web server as soon as you preview the message. Turn off this preview pane which is described above. Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions.
A patch released April 11 can literally destroy your Outlook Express address book. This one is documented in security bulletin MS06-016. We've heard reports that installing the patch causes the address book to be completely removed. So if you use OE and you've updated your system since April 11, you should check to see if you still have an address book. The good news is that if you uninstall the patch, the address book magically reappears. The bad news is that if you use automatic updates, Windows will just download and reinstall the patch again. The solution is to set your update properties to ask you before installing anything. It's a little more trouble, but it can save you a world of grief. For info, click here.
This is a simple fix, but we get this question from readers every week: they've installed Service Pack 2 and now when they open email messages in OE, they get a red X placeholder instead of images that were embedded in the message. This happens because of a security setting that SP2 turns on by default. You can easily turn it back off. Here's how:
Email is, for many people, the most used Internet application - but there's plenty that can go wrong. If you use Microsoft Outlook or Outlook Express as your mail client, you may sometimes receive error messages that are difficult to figure out. KB article 813514 covers some of the most common error messages and provides tips on how to resolve or work around the problems: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/813514/en-us

Please contact your system administrator" then check out this Microsoft article for help: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310049/en-us
What happened to the option to make pictures smaller?Once upon a time, when I would attach a picture to email in Outlook Express, a dialog box would pop up, offering to make them smaller. I almost always said "no" - but somewhere along the way I stopped getting asked and recently I did have some photos taken at very high resolution that I wanted to make smaller before sending. Do you know how I can get this option back?
The lack of the "make pictures smaller" dialog box usually means a DLL has become corrupted or unregistered. To fix the problem, try registering the DDL. Here's how:
Unlike anti-virus programs, multiple spam filters can play nicely together and provide you with better protection against unwanted email. It doesn't take the place of a good commercial spam filter like iHateSpam, but if you use Microsoft Office, you can add another layer of spam catching with the built-in junk mail filters. And now you can make those filters more efficient by reporting any spam that still gets through to Microsoft. Doing so is a one-click operation when you download and install the Junk E-mail Reporting Tool at:
When you send photos via email, Windows gives you the option to make them smaller so as to require less bandwidth when recipients download them. This is especially useful if you're sending someone with a slow dialup connection. If you don't see this option, it may be because the shimgvw.dll file is not registered. To find out how to register the file and resolve the problem, see KB article 555547 at: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555547/en-us
how do i create a regular expression for a nfl players that threw for 3000 or more yards and more than 30 touchdowns.
I doubt that you can. Even if you can, it would be a bad solution to your problem because it is far beyond what regular expressions are intended to do. A range of numeric values is not a 'pattern'.
You have a .csv file. You first have to parse it into columns. Based on your single sample, you could split the line on commas. A better solution is to use a module such as Text::CSV.

Klara Glosova (°1969, Brno, Czech Republic) is an artist who works in a variety of media. By taking daily life as subject matter while commenting on the everyday aesthetic of middle class values, Glosova often creates work using creative game tactics, but these are never permissive. Play is a serious matter: during the game, different rules apply than in everyday life and even everyday objects undergo transubstantiation.
Her artworks are characterised by the use of everyday objects in an atmosphere of middleclass mentality in which recognition plays an important role. By examining the ambiguity and origination via retakes and variations, she often creates several practically identical works, upon which thoughts that have apparently just been developed are manifested: notes are made and then crossed out again, ‘mistakes’ are repeated.
Her works are on the one hand touchingly beautiful, on the other hand painfully attractive. Again and again, the artist leaves us orphaned with a mix of conflicting feelings and thoughts. By manipulating the viewer to create confusion, she tries to increase the dynamic between audience and author by objectifying emotions and investigating the duality that develops through different interpretations.
Her works never shows the complete structure. This results in the fact that the artist can easily imagine an own interpretation without being hindered by the historical reality. Klara Glosova currently lives and works in Seattle.

First, the Jenny Craig Diet is a three-level diet program that first started in Australia in and later launched operations in America in The three levels are ultimately aimed at delivering weight loss by teaching the dieter to eat what they like — but in smaller portions.
Part of the plan teaches the client how to boost their energy levels given their reduced amounts of food consumption, through simple and manageable physical activities.
Our first indication that this may be a rough review were the slew of customer comments on price. A little research into cost and we were flat-out shocked. This is how much it costs to start on the respective program. We always recommend trying a product before making a large investment.
The Jenny Craig Diet claims to help clients achieve their desired weight goal by using the three elements of food, body and mind. The program specifically mentions that no food is a taboo, however they claim to help dieters become mindful of the number of calories that are in the foods they eat.
This way a person can dictate the amount of food they will consume in a sitting depending on the weight they want to lose or maintain. The element of the body is as important as dieting is. According to the program, a person must be physically active for the digestion of food to happen effectively.
To produce the maximum energy required by the body to function adequately, you need to stay active. The program provides work out strategies that they say are client-friendly, simple and not too time-consuming. The third element they focus on is the mind. An official of the program, Mr.
It has been scientifically proven that people animals and plants that live in a positive, encouraging and supportive environment tend to thrive more, but no research backing this plan specifically. The Jenny Craig program claims to provide their clients with a support system and a set of affirmations that the clients can recite daily. Customers are also promised a weight-loss counselor on standby and a forum where the they can encourage each other. To us, this all sounds fine — except for one thing.
We still need to determine whether this diet works, because all this talk of high costs and lack of scientific evidence has us a bit worried at the moment. After its conception in Australia and USA the program slowly grew in popularity.
Jenny Craig, who is the founder of the company together with her husband, later sold this diet plan to Nestle in The Jenny Craig diet consists of prepackaged foods that already have the calories counted for you.
Generally, these foods are frozen and are meant for breakfast, lunch, dinner and dessert. The program advises the clients that indulge this diet plan to supplement each meal with fresh fruit, non-dairy products and vegetables for maximum satisfaction. Jenny Craig meal plans do not dismiss or promote any specific foods.
The numerous prepackaged foods do not have a limitation to what is considered healthy or not. However according to WebMD , the program leans more toward low fat, low calorie foods that have high water, fiber and protein content. But in the case of vegetables and fruits such as broccoli, oranges and tomatoes, one can have as many as they want. Alcoholic beverages are also allowed occasionally. After a while, when the client has shown growth and ability to stand on their own without the support, the program also teaches them how to do Jenny Craig meal planning at home.
How does one do this? First, you need to buy yourself a weighing scale. An electronic one is preferable because it shows your weight to the last point which makes it more accurate and easier to track your weight loss. Once you have your weight recorded, you can then calculate the number of calories you should be eating each day to lose weight. Using an online BMI calculator is also advised.
Get yourself linked to a weight loss friend, a dietitian or counselor. Someone who will be there for you whenever you needed them. As mentioned earlier, having someone who believes in you and relates to your struggles is very important in making any positive progress. You should be able to have a set amount of time, say 20 minutes each day, where you meet and talk with your weight loss partner about your progress.
By doing this, not only will you have an accountability partner who will always keep you in track and help you if you slipped, you will also have the motivation to do better because no one likes being a disappointment. The next and maybe most important thing is to stock up on the low-calorie foods. Throw away all the high calorie and high fat foods in your house and anything over-processed.
Remember the program does not ban any type of food, but chemical and synthetic products are not qualified as food. Instead buy and keep in large quantities whole foods, low dairy foods, fruits and vegetables of your liking, proteins such as lentils and black beans, nuts, chicken preferably skinless, canned fish and water. You should then try as much as possible to cook these foods in very little oil. Deep frying should be in very limited occasions if any.
The next step then is to take the calorie chart that you made when you recorded your weight and divide it into 6 meals that you will be taking throughout the day. For example, if the calories that you are required to take to lose weight are a day, then you are supposed to make 6 meals, each carrying calories and eat them.
A day has twenty-four hours, but are for sleeping so you will be working with roughly 18 hours. This means that the 6 meals should have a three-hour spacing. You can choose to have all the meals with the uniform number of calories or, make some meals like breakfast heavier than day time snacks.
You can start with as little as 20 minutes and work your way up gradually. The trick is to be consistent and disciplined. It does this by increasing the number of islet cells in the pancreas and actually regenerates and repairs islet cells previously destroyed by free radicals. Other herbs— I also recommend a number of herbal supplements to help improve insulin sensitivity. One is Galega officinalis, which contains an ingredient called guanidine from which the diabetes drug metformin is produced.
And the second is Mormodica Charantia, or bitter lemon. I recommend mg of a 4: Together, these two herbs alone can have a modest effect on insulin sensitivity, but when combined with the other supplements mentioned here, they can make quite a difference. Clots, Strokes -- but not for bleeding strokes] Dr. In fact, she hadn't had a decent night's sleep in over a year.
When I examined her, June was overweight and her blood pressure was elevated. The emergency doctor had prescribed a nitroglycerin patch for the angina. Nitroglycerin is a very old herbal remedy that works exceptionally well for angina.
It causes the blood vessels leading to the heart to expand and permits more blood to flow in. The first thing I did was to tell her to stay on her nitro patch. Then, I prescribed the homeopathic medication, ignatia. Ignatia is an excellent remedy for conditions caused by grief, especially insomnia. Next, I explained to her that blood flow was not just a matter of how big the arteries are. It is also a matter of how thick the blood is.
Thick blood is like oil on a cold day. It can't flow well, and tends to clog. That's why the doctor had placed her on an aspirin twice a day. To keep her blood thin and flowing well, I prescribed two treatments. First, I put her on a boiled vegetables-only diet. Absolutely no fat or protein. Dietary fat and protein thickens the blood for several hours after eating, and this was not a good idea for her at this time.
Second, I had her take the following supplements three times a day: All of these remedies work in different ways to thin out the blood. Then I stopped the aspirin: No need to take aspirin now that she was on this therapy. The last thing she needed was an aspirin-induced ulcer. She was sleeping better, and had more energy. Better yet, her angina pains never returned. I told her to stop the nitro patches, because I didn't think she needed them anymore.
Two months later, I sent June to a cardiologist for evaluation. Although she felt great and had lost 17 pounds, I wanted to make sure she was ready to start exercising. The cardiologist performed a stress test and an echocardiogram. No signs of heart disease at all.
She was given full permission to start a regular exercise program. It is now seven years later. I see June once a year just to make sure that she is taking good care of herself. The key to her program is a combination of monthly chelation treatments combined with a personalized diet and an exercise program. She remarried two years ago, and told me she has never been happier.
I have a question about garlic. What's the best way to consume it: I prefer to use the natural garlic as opposed to capsules, but have not been able to discover which is most beneficial. In this form, it's one of the best remedies for intestinal parasites and yeast.
I'll never forget a patient I had once who had severe coronary artery disease, and was told by his cardiologist that he needed an immediate surgery or he would surely die. Instead he started eating a whole bulb of raw garlic a day, along with two teaspoons of cayenne pepper. But it shows you how powerful the herb is. I would recommend that you mince fresh garlic, let it soak in olive oil for about an hour, and take it that way.

Sometimes it seems our country has traded places with the cold war communists of days past. We may not agree with everything that Putin does in the name of Russia, but at least he is willing to do what our President is not in the US — protect his people from genetically modified foods.
But even with this in mind, we nevertheless have legitimate methods and instruments to protect our own market, and above all citizens. The WTO is a big pusher of genetically modified crops. They would then be obliged to actively seek the additional information needed for a more objective risk assessment, and to review the measure within a reasonable period of time.

Hear the 'Awakenings' podcast from the Health Ranger http: It is an evergreen tree from South America that produces a type of bark that has been claimed to cure or prevent cancer, along with other illnesses.
The scientific name is Tabebuia avellanedae, and the tea that is made from this bark is often referred to as "Pau d'arco," though many alternative names have been used. The University of Maryland found that this specific tea, or bark extract, has anticancer properties, as well as anti-inflammatory, antiparasitic, antifungal and antimicrobial properties. There has not been any well-known testing on humans, but studies have already proven that this particular bark provides a stimulation of immune system cells known as macrophages.
Additionally, this bark has been reported to kill lung cancer cells and liver cancer cells that were grown and analyzed in a test-tube study. The tea, often called Taheebo tea, is hard to mix with water, requiring up to 20 minutes of varying heat and boiling measures, but many people have reported this particular tea to have cured them of their health ailments.
One website reports a testimonial that claims this tea to have cured a man diagnosed with lymphoma, and who had only a matter of months to live. In , Anna Hodgekiss with the Daily Mail reported a woman who had been diagnosed with Crohn's disease and who took it upon herself to test many different barks for a cure. She did not specify the particular bark she found successful, but she has already sold it to a pharmaceutical company, going to show that bark is a form of treatment in which people can place their trust.
The typical uses of Pau d'arco, listed by the University of Maryland, include treatment of cancer, candidiasis, influenza, parasitic disease, herpes and bacterial infection. Louise Tenney writes in the Cancer News Journal, that this tree bark, sometimes called Ipe Roxo, has curative powers that have proved countless times to have healed thousands of people. It very well might be that the cure for cancer is found in this tree bark. Distributors of this bark reported that a client cured his dog of a skin condition with the tea.
The owner himself claims this tea cured colon cancer in his own father. Although this tree is now endangered, the main producers of the tea instructs people to use their signature method when stripping the bark from the tree so that it does not kill the species but leaves it able to produce more bark for future harvests. High levels of the bark extract have the potential to be poisonous.
One study, however, conducted in the 70s by the National Cancer Institute, found no toxic effects on liver or kidney tissue. The ACS also claims that many people are selling derivatives and false variations of the bark. There was a study in Canada that tested 12 products claiming to be Pau d'arco and found only one of these products to have contained lapachol, which is the pure ingredient of Pau d'arco.
The University of Maryland cautions consumers that this bark in heavy doses can cause unmanageable bleeding, while some proponents actually claim this is a blood builder. It is hard to tell how beneficial this herb exactly is, but it might prove more helpful than harsher Western medical treatments.
Sources of this article include: Their antioxidant component scientifically proven to cause cancer http: We're talking about nearly 75, Americans each year. Is this a plague upon us? Chickens are supposed to eat BUGS too, y'know? Also, fish are supposed to eat plankton, krill and algae and many types are high in omega-3 -- not corn and ground up-larger fish from which they accumulate heavy metals, PCBs and other toxins.
Much of what medical researchers conclude in their studies is misleading, exaggerated, or flat-out wrong. So why are doctors—to a striking extent—still drawing upon misinformation in their everyday practice?
John Ioannidis has spent his career challenging his peers by exposing their bad science. A new book exposes the fraud and reviews the legitimate alternative cures. Neither a cure nor prevention is the priority any longer, because the real money is made from treating cancer. Despite the efforts of the cartel to suppress natural cancer therapies, many have succeeded in actually curing thousands of terminal patients so that they can return to a normal life.
Juxtaposing these alternative therapies against traditional therapy is the focus of the book. As far as the 'War on Cancer', even with hundreds of billions contributed to the cause over the past 4 decades, the survival rate shows little improvement.
In place of the medical cartel-devised Obamacare, a new system designed from the ground up is needed to create truly affordable healthcare. It's necessary to take a stand, don't wait for armed IRS agents to come knocking at your door.
Interleaved with these stories are factual reports about the Medical Cartel. Tribute is paid to visionaries who made major contributions towards our understanding of cancer, especially Dr Otto Warburg, Nobel Prize winner and biochemist who discovered the generic cause of cancer in the 's.
Other great innovators in cancer research and promotion of natural cures are Dean Burk, Max Gerson, Stanislaw Burzynski and Ernst Krebs Jr who each achieved extraordinary breakthroughs. Now, the imposition of Obamacare appears to be an even worse omen for the future. Later, he tried to change his promise to a conditional one: That era has been long gone as a large number of Congressmen now spend their time huddling with lobbyists and planning new ways to enrich large corporations.
This situation is reflected in the lowest public opinion poll of Congress ever taken. When the first round of insurance cancellation notices were sent out in the last quarter of , the deception of 'keeping your healthcare plan' hit home to 6,, Americans who held private insurance. Even worse, the Department of Health and Human Services HHS estimates another 75 million who have employer-provided health insurance will lose their existing plans as well.
According to Ron Paul, "16, armed bureaucrats coming to make this program work - if it was a good program and everybody liked it, you wouldn't need 16, thugs coming with their guns and putting you in jail if you didn't follow all the rules.
Senator Max Baucus, from whose committee the bill originated said Obamacare was drafted by Liz Fowler, left, who was Vice President at WellPoint, the largest private health insurer in the country. Then she returned to the Senator's committee to play a prime role in drafting Obamacare legislation.
Not only did Fowler play a major role in writing the law, but she then joined the Obama Administration to help implement the law. Yet even with documented evidence of their successful cures and patient testimonies to back them up, these medical visionaries have suffered inordinate harassment and in some cases arrests, lawsuits and trials initiated by the American Medical Association and the corrupt FDA until most were forced to close their clinics and leave the United States.
The people most affected by this harassment and persecution are those cancer patients who desire alternative therapies that work and those classified as terminal, left with no hope. Besides assisting Big Pharma research, they helped the FDA by producing negative test results for natural therapies.
They served to expand membership, raise income and attack all known alternative cancer therapies, forcing most out of business. The revolving door between the Drug monoliths and the FDA is well known and explains their priorities.
Fluoridation and Cancer As Dr Burk of the NCI revealed thru scientific studies, adding Fluoride to city reservoirs results in dramatically higher cancer rates in those cities.
Vaccination and Cancer A steady increase in the vaccinations of young children has led to the dramatic increase in cancer over the past 60 years. The SV40 virus embedded in the polio vaccines of the 50's has proven to be a virulent carcinogen. Vaccine preservatives such as mercury and formaldehyde are also highly toxic and bio-accumulate in the body.
At the FDA, which is, in fact, killing Americans at that rate, no one has ever felt the need to step forward and speak up. Let's shift the venue and ask the same question. If you were a medical reporter for a major media outlet in the US, and you knew the above fact, wouldn't you make it a priority to say something, write something, do something? And with that, let's go to the smoking guns. The report was compiled by outside researchers who went into the FDA's own database of "serious adverse [medical-drug] events.
The FDA knows and it isn't saying anything about it, because the FDA certifies, as safe and effective, all the medical drugs that are routinely maiming and killing Americans. Previously, I have documented that the FDA knows; because the FDA has a page on its own website that admits , people are killed every year by medical drugs, and two million more people are severely injured by the drugs. And for the past five years or so, I have been writing about and citing a published report by the late Dr.
Barbara Starfield that indicates , people in the US are killed by medical drugs every year. Until her death in , Dr. Her report, "Is US health really the best in the world? Since the Department of Homeland Security is working its way into every nook and corner of American life, hyper-extending its mandate to protect all of us from everything, why shouldn't I go along with Janet Napolitano's advice: This is what I see and this is what I'm saying.
How many smoking guns do we need before a sitting president shuts down the FDA buildings, fumigates the place, and prosecutes very large numbers of FDA employees? Do we need , smoking guns every year?
Do we need relatives of the people who've all died in the span of merely a year, from the poisonous effects of FDA-approved medical drugs, to bring their corpses to the doors of FDA headquarters?
And let me ask another question. If instead of drugs like warfarin, dabigatran, levofloxacin, carboplatin, and lisinopril the five leading killers in the FDA database , the , deaths per year were led by gingko, ginseng, vitamin D, niacin, and raw milk, what do you think would happen? I'll tell you what would happen. The resulting fatalities would be written off as necessary collateral damage in the fight to keep America safe and healthy.
All those phony stories in the press, reported dutifully by so-called medical reporters? The stories about maybe-could-be-possible-miracle breakthroughs just over the horizon of state-of-the-art medical research? Those stories are there to obscure the very, very hard facts of medically-caused death on the ground. The buck stops at the FDA. Except in the real world, it doesn't. Which tells you something about the so-called real world and how much of it is composed of propaganda.
Here is the situation. No medical drug in the US can be released for public use unless and until the FDA says it is safe and effective. The FDA is spitting out drug approvals month after month and year after year, and the drugs are routinely killing , people a year and maiming two million more, which adds up to a million deaths per decade and 20 million maimings per decade.
The FDA and the federal government are doing nothing about it, even though they know what's going on. This is mass murder. Well, a New York court made such a determination long ago, and recently refused the plea of a plaintiff who tried to overturn the archaic decision.
Massachusetts], all children who attend New York pubic schools can be 'forced' to be vaccinated, according to a 2nd circuit court of law. The law was determined in but was recently challenged by Dina Check, the plaintiff who decided that her Catholic religion gave her a right to determine whether or not her child should be vaccinated.
While religious leanings are a fine reason to refuse a vaccination -- the court also determined against her in the case because there was 'strong evidence' that her refusal vaccines were due to her fear of them being harmful, and not due to her religious beliefs.
Unfortunately, it's true that vaccines can potentially cause unwanted problems, as outlined even by the CDC's Vaccine Adverse Event reports. Vaccine could lead to reproductive health damage, hampered child development, and other neurological disorders.
This is no less abhorrent than the teenage girl who was recently told by a court of law that she HAD to get chemotherapy for her cancer treatment. How can the nations of the free make such an enforcement on its citizens? There are currently 58 bills in 24 different states that would limit your rights when it comes to vaccines, and in some cases, you would be forced or face jail time or have your children taken from you by Child Protective Services.
This should also cause a moment of reflection since the US has an extremely high infant mortality rate and we start vaccinating our babies before they even reach 12 months old. I hope Dina Check appeals, and so does the year old Hodgkin's patient. Your health is your right. Obamacare Fiasco This chapter covers a description of the failed launch, website deficiencies, security issues, continuing exclusions and delays and the insidious role of the IRS.
Natural therapies are available and the book highlights several possibilities. One must realize that cancer is not some foreign invader but a part of our biological process that has run amuck. It can be cured with proper knowledge and self discipline.

Hugo Salinas Price [Lindsey Williams knows this Mexican billionaire, who has given us advice about the coming collapse of the dollar -- search for his name on my Latest page.
When the war was over, the Spanish began to investigate the culture of the conquered people and found, to their amazement, that the people of what is now Mexico possessed a vast body of medical knowledge based on the curative qualities of plants. The Spanish filed reports and sent back to Spain drawings of the plants with their Aztec names together with information about their curative powers. The reaction of the doctors in Spain was immediate. They do not know that the human body is governed by four humors or liquid spirits in the body: These humors are affected by the planets, the Sun and the Moon.
When there is no balance of these humors in the body, then the body is sick. The Aztecs have only experience upon which to base their medicine; our medicine is vastly superior because we know the true theory of health, and we deduce our medicine from the theory. All that medicine from New Spain Mexico is nonsense.
Faced by an accuser, he pulled out a cutting from an herb from a little bag he was carrying. He asked the accuser to smell it, which he did. Nothing could stop it. The Aztec was implored to stop the bleeding. He pulled out another herb from his bag and gave it to the bleeding man to smell. The hemorrhage stopped immediately. The case against the Aztec doctor was dismissed.
Such is the world, and such it will ever be. Today, Ph Ds in Economics infest the landscape. However, we are not to be taken into account, like the Aztec doctors, because we do not know the all-important theory. We only have the experience of centuries, or millennia, to back up our considerations, and that of course, cuts no ice: Take the case of the Dutchman Antony van Leeuwenhoek He became wealthy as a cloth merchant.
In his youth, as an apprentice to a cloth merchant, he first saw a magnifying glass, which was used by such merchants to examine their goods more closely. Later on, he developed a fascination with lenses; he began to make his own lenses and to apply them to looking at tiny things which had never been examined before.
He wrote to the Royal Society believing them to be open-mined and interested in his work. Well, the Royal Society disbelieved his account of these microbes — the first any man had seen! He was only a retired cloth merchant. What could he know? Then again, we have Galileo, who first saw the moons that circle Jupiter, which convinced him that the Earth circles the Sun — an opinion hateful to the Catholic Church at that time.
He barely escaped burning at the stake, a fate which ended the life of Giordano Bruno in , who postulated an infinite Universe and the multiplicity of worlds. An emissary from the Inquisition visited Galileo in his home.
Galileo urged him to look through his telescope and see the moons of Jupiter for himself. The official refused to look through the telescope. Theory or dogma had to take precedence. The facts are irrelevant if they do not confirm the theory or dogma. This attitude prevails to our day, and will always prevail as long as human nature is what it is. The experience of the Wright brothers is illuminating with regard to the Media. The Wright brothers had been flying their airplane on the outskirts of Dayton, Ohio, for five years before the local newspaper decided to send a reporter to investigate — the idea of a heavier-than-air machine taking to the air was unthinkable, why bother?
The vast majority of people do not really see with their own eyes: However, hundreds of millions of individuals all over the world attribute the collapse of these buildings to the fact that they were struck by two airplanes, and they will get angry if you suggest that the buildings could not have collapsed as a result of those airplanes crashing into them; the fact that WTC-7 collapsed on its own footprint, like the Twin Towers, and no airplane struck it is — well, beside the point for these people.
Facts are supposed to confirm a theory; if they do not — then the facts must be shelved. So the uncomfortable facts that archeologists come up with are filtered out of their reports.
In their field of investigation, theory comes first, and only facts which agree with the Darwinian theory of evolution are reported. Other facts are discreetly ignored. But the ultimate delusion prevailing in the world for the last forty years is fiat money. This delusion is so powerful that only a tiny minority among the close to 7 billion human beings on Earth is aware that it is a delusion, that all the money being used in the world as money, is in fact not money, but a simulation of money.
Fiat money is now rapidly destroying the world, but in spite of all the signs pointing to fiat money as the cause, the foremost brains of the world refuse to acknowledge the fact. Their theories, which they were taught in prestigious schools and universities, take precedence over the fact of collapsing economies. This book was first published in , and reprinted in This book places before us a microcosm of our present world.
What happened in Revolutionary France in the years to is precisely what is taking place in the whole world in The world is living in a process of monetary degeneration which began, explicitly, with the outbreak of World War I in , though its origin lay in a series of previous financial malpractices dating back years before World War I; the disastrous conclusion of that process is approaching. The lawmakers, impatient to resolve the problem of economic malaise which the Revolution itself had caused, decided to take a short-cut to stimulate the economy.
Deaf to the warnings of men with financial experience, they confirmed to one another the supposed validity of their fallacious reasoning; convincing themselves of the viability of their monetary scheme, the lawmakers carried forward a project based on fiat money — money irredeemable in gold or silver. In spite of the negative results which this policy soon produced — a steadily falling purchasing power of this fiat money, reflected in the rising prices of all goods - they insisted on pressing forward on this mistaken road and attributed the bad results to everything but their policy of inflation with fictitious money.
That invariable law of finance with regard to fiat money, the law of the acceleration in the issue of fiat money and its concomitant accelerated depreciation, took possession of the French legislature.
Seven years later, France was totally ruined. Manufacturing had closed down. Unemployment was pervasive and consequently the stagnating salaries for labor brought enormous hardship for the poor, amid rising prices of food, clothing and fuel. Unemployment was only relieved by the military drafts which sent millions of Frenchmen to their deaths in the foreign wars. Morals suffered a precipitous decline. All business activity became a game of chance.
Speculation enriched unscrupulous men and at the same time swept the poorer classes of the population into misery. Famine forced the government to dole out bread to the population.
What is perhaps most noteworthy in this fateful French experiment is that not one of those responsible for the disaster ever acknowledged having been mistaken. What took place in France, under the régime of fiat money, is precisely what is happening in our world today.
The same phenomena observed in France in the 18th century can be seen all over the world, today. Those responsible for the huge world crisis of the present time insist on continuing down the path that led to this disaster.
Not one of those responsible is willing to recognize that they have all been mistaken. They insist, as did the French revolutionaries, on applying greater doses of fiat money: The destruction of France took only seven years. The same policy that destroyed France now operates around the world. Therefore, the moral and economic destruction has taken longer, since the whole world is the theatre of this tragedy, and not only one country.
The fatal outcome of this experiment with fiat money will arrive, sooner or later; it will have worldwide effects and it will take a century, at least, for the world to regain economic health. And when this tragic conclusion shall have arrived, the readers of this little book may be quite sure that not one of those responsible for the catastrophe will ever admit that he had been mistaken.

It's all part of the plan to prop up the profits of Big Pharma by eliminating the competition The FDA says, ridiculously, that only pharmaceutical drugs are capable of preventing or treating disease. Another issue that might cause clients to be critical of the company is their relatively high counseling rates and a wide array of products.

Do Not Send Email Notifications. My blood pressure is down and have been able to decrease my medication. I have kept the weight off for almost a year. Even during the holidays when I cheated a bit and an occasional Twix.
Seems to be a very balanced diet. The only thing you lose is your sanity and money if you are truely trying to lose alot of wieght this is not for you. Please aviod the same trappings I did the advertisement was misleading. Cut out ALL fast food drink losts of water and move.
I agree with Cristy!! This program cuts your calories way too low to be healthy long not part of a medical field and have no medical training. The scrubs are deceptive as is the advertisements and representations.
If you want any information, email me at alstewart2 sbcglobal. Do you get a response to the corp office number, if so I would love for you to share.
Did anyone find a number to a corporate office- I am very unhappy with them and how I was treated- I was not losing the 3 to 5 pounds quaranteed and now am just getting blown off by the center. I certainly do not agree with how you felt you were treated by the Slim for Life representative, as she should have maintained a professional attitude and responded to your needs with understanding,and explaniations, rather than insult.
The result would be that as people were leading a healthy lifestyle, taking care of their medical issues with herbals, the Drs industry would be negatively affected. I have used herbal supplements for many medical issues that I have encountered in my life with little to no side affects, I have been able to avoid the Dr Appointments and the prescriptions, with the long and distubing list of possible side affects that I may encounter which is longer and more damaging than the symptoms to the initial health issue I was encountering.
There are alternative solutions out there. I have several friends that have been very successful with the Slim 4 life plan as well as other plans that are availble. The internet is a great resource for research. You are absolutely right. I was saying the same thing when I was reading what the doctor said. What in the world could an herbal drug do to hinder your prescription drug except for maybe keep the prescription side affects from killing you?
You should really be looking at what that prescription is doing to your system as opposed to the herbs. I was on Weight Watchers for over a year and lost alot of weight but did not stick with it so I have gained half of it back.
I just joined Slim 4 Life because you can talk to someone for support daily one on one instead of once a week in front of a large group.
I have high blood pressure and high colest. Can you tell me what program they use for people with these conditions? I started slim4life Dec. I did loose down to lbs and really maintained at about to as the year finished out — however I began to show symptoms of something.
Went to doctor and turns out that my liver has been affected and that something has brought this on — I do wonder if it was all of the thermoboost powder which I drank on a daily basis for the year along with the thermo snacks required during weight loss. If you have had a similar issue please respond back to me ASAP — I am unable to find out much since slim4life is now slimgenics and they no longer allow past participates to purchase product.
I am interested in anything that might be similar to my situation. Hi, I did slim 4 life as well and lost about 35 lbs. Before I started, I had normal liver function tests. When I had my blood tested, post S4L i had elevated liver function x2 , I recently went back and had it checked again and now I have elevated liver function x3.
The only thing in my life that changed during that time was that I was on S4L. I highly suspect that either the carb blockers or the red grays have affected my liver. I am no longer on S4L and I no longer take any of their supplements. I never used the thermoboost powder but I took all the supplements as directed during the program. I too am being evaluated for elevated liver function.
It started with a dull ache in the liver area right after I started slimgenics. I have an ultrasound tomorrow, will keep you posted. I have been off the supplements for at least a month but am still having the pain….
I started slim4life in May, at lbs…am now at and while I love the way I look, my hair is falling out and my kidney function is out of whack as well as my ferritin levels have bottomed out. I would just like to know how the product work? Another thing is how much it cost to get started with the program?
Is this something i could do without paying a large amount of money? What are the key elements to losing weight on this program? What makes this program different from the other programs out? Slim 4 Life is a good program.
They do teach you the essentials of eating healthy. However, the weight that you lose is great but, you may also be losing muscle since they do not incorporate working out into the program. You do take supplements such as a daily vitamin, essential fatty acids fish oil and an appetite suppressant they call the metabolizer not to mention the protein bars and shakes that run more than I went from to in a short amount of time. Once, I hit I plateaued miserably. I did all that they asked me to do and could not lose any more weight.
I was basically told, they could not help me. I left Slim 4 Life and they still call me wanting me to come in. I work out now and still eat healthy but, I eat corn, carrots, and cheese. All of which is forbidden until you lose ALL the weight. I am happy and healthy and still am losing in a healthy way on my own.. Wish I had read this page before I spent almost two thousand dollars on Slim 4 Life.
I was on the program for aproximately three and a half weeks going to the store four times a week for weigh ins. I lost six pounds by drinking tons of water and taking there suplements which ending up making my heart race. I ended up in the Doctors office thinking I was having a heart attack.
Believe me there is no money back guarantee. This turned out to be one big mistake….. Hi, l feel the same way two thousand dollars on slim 4 life. The pills did not do a thing for me. I need to get some of my money back. I tried slim for life a year ago and it is so disappointing.

Your lymphatic system is like the trash removal service in your body. An important point about health of the lymphatic system, besides exercise and diet, also includes looking to your environment.
Eliminating toxins in your home can be a huge help to your overall health and lymphatic health, especially with chronic illness. This means choosing organic produce and hormone- and antibiotic-free meats, ditching the chemical cleaners and perfume, finding cleaner alternatives to the makeup you wear. You want the pressure to be gentle and light, rather than aggressive and strong. During or after the massage, you may feel drainage release from your nose and sinuses make its way down your throat.
Most lymphatic massages involve circular motions on or around the lymph nodes, pumping them physically to help with movement and toxin removal. Men and women might have different lymph nodes that become blocked and painful, due to physiological differences.
Men, for example, may accumulate lymph in the inguinal nodes, near or above the front hip crease, due to activity in the prostate gland. Women, on the other hand, likely experience blocked, painful nodes in the axillary area, near the armpit toward the breast.
These light beams are specially designed to aid the body in moving lymphatic fluid through negative-charge light photons and low currents.

May we use your article and graphics as a resource? Of course we will give credit to your work. It is well stated and easy to understand. Check out this page: Your email address will not be published. The lymphatic system, a vital part of the immune system, is comprised of lymph nodes, glands, and vessels, which gather waste and interstitial fluid.
The lymphatic system also transports white blood cells into the bones and transports fatty acids. Your spleen is part of your lymphatic system, working to filter blood, and house white and red blood cells and platelets. Your tonsils, another part of the lymphatic system, contain B cells that fight infections, and your thymus gland helps T cells, a type of lymphocytes essential to the immune system, to mature.
Those with chronic illness, sedentary lifestyle, or recent surgery can suffer from stagnant lymph. Some signs that lymphatic fluids might not be flowing well within your body include swelling, constipation, tender nodes, weight gain, frequent infections and viruses, and chronic congestion or sore throat.
One of the best things you can do for lymph movement is exercise: Any type of movement, even vigorous household cleaning, can be helpful. Self-drainage massages, myofascial releases, and professional lymphatic drainage massages also act as a pump to encourage lymph fluid from remaining stagnant. Rebounding is another excellent activity for lymphatic drainage.
You can buy an inexpensive, personal-sized trampoline and bounce on it for just minutes a day. Eating organic vegetables, fresh fruits, and homemade juices, along with staying hydrated, are additional ways to give your body an edge with lymphatic health.

You're not going to like this one bit: Caffeine is an alkaloid that the c The astrological period of the Leo runs from July 23rd to August 22nd. It is continuous throughout the entire body — There are also deep lymphatic systems but by working on the superficial lymphatic system, you can affect drainage throughout the entire lymphatic system.
Some of the important and mysterious parts of the body are the various glands. These select their required substances from which they synthesize new compounds.?? Upon the work of these secretions which the glands send forth into the body depends digestion, absorption and utilization of all food elements, and the very existence of cells.?? No physiological or mental activity is possible without them. In their absence the body and its activities would cease to be.
Manifestly, the glands cannot pick their required elements from the blood unless their progenitors were previously taken in the foods eaten.?? The lymph vessels are fine tubes which accompany the blood vessels.
They contain the lymph, a colorless, alkaline fluid, partly derived from the blood, partly from the juices of the partaken foods. To the lymph tubes belong the lymph glands, which are distributed over the whole system, having been given the task of extracting poisonous substances from the lymph.?? The lymph travels through the whole body like the blood, gathers in larger and larger vessels, and finally flows into the large veins near the heart; here it mixes with the blood, passes through the kidneys and lungs, and finally enters the heart as fresh new blood.??
The more toxic the poisons and mucus materials taken into the system, the more often the glands accumulate this bad waste from the lymph system and we have glandular swellings over various parts of the body. An impure blood stream, constipation and a generally toxic body condition cause the glands to swell up and become painful.
These may be on the neck, under the armpits, groin, etc. Formula for rebuilding glands using sarsaparilla, licorice, ginseng and astragulus as found in the Adrenal Newsletter.
Cayce has a Formula that is similar and recommended to be used with the change of the seasons.?? What Can be Done for a Malfunctioning Thyroid? From a question to Dr. Christopher in his Newsletter.
Also, it is of special importance for the proper functioning of the reproductive system. The inter-relationship between reproductive functions and thyroid functions is very complex and not entirely? For instance, a slight enlargement of the thyroid gland is common at puberty, during pregnancy and menopause. Disorders of the thyroid gland are apparently caused by two conditions:?
We have had earaches in our family which resulted from congested lymph glands and colds. By inserting oil of Mullein into the ear, however, we were able to stop the irritation in the ear as well as in the accompanying glands. It contains essential hormones and enzymes necessary to keep the pituitary and adrenal glands functioning. There is a story we have told at many lectures and classes about the family that was incarcerated in a concentration camp during the Nazi occupation of Europe.
This particular family found the strength to carry them through to the end of the war when they were released. The key was an alfalfa plant growing in the corner of the compound, inside the fence. Each member of the family secretly permitted themselves a few leaves of the plant every day… allowing the alfalfa plant to replenish its leaves throughout the long months. The family obtained the necessary nutriments from the plant.
These nutriments were not provided by the inferior and scarce prison food. The family maintained their health while others around them dropped dead from malnutrition. There is a complex circulatory system in the body whose function can mean health or disease for each of us.
You may have heard the name of this system, but you might not know what it does or how it works. Most people have a fair understanding about the blood circulation system of the body, and many people have heard of the lymph nodes, but relatively few people know how significant the entire lymph system really is. In fact, our bodies have twice the amount of lymph as blood and there are twice as many lymphatic vessels as there are blood vessels. In turn, the cells produce proteins and waste products and then the lymph absorbs these products and carries them away.
Any random bacteria that enter the body also find their way into this intercellular fluid. The fluid will return to the blood stream, but first, because it becomes contaminated with cell waste products, it must be cleaned.
This is accomplished by filtering the lymph through the lymph nodes. At one time or another, everybody has felt congested nodes, especially in the neck, armpit, or groin.
Toxins and poisons from something as simple as a cut finger can cause pain and swelling in the armpit nodes; an infected toe might cause the same type of feeling in the groin area nodes.
One place where we almost always notice lymph nodes is in the neck. When you have a sore throat or sinus congestion, you might become alarmed if you suddenly find a lump in your neck. Usually it is nothing more than a hard-working, efficient lymph node. Although the lymph system has millions of vessels all over the body just like the blood system there is one big difference. It has no pump like the heart to keep it moving. Instead lymph is moved by breathing, walking, intestinal activity, and muscle action.
As muscles tighten, lymph vessels are squeezed and the lymph is pushed through the system and through the filtering nodes on its way back to the veins and the heart. Some other things that can be involved include recurrent low back ache, tennis elbow, sprained ankles, and even frequent nighttime urination.
Obviously, for good health, we need to keep our lymph system moving, so exercise is essential to make our muscles contract, the lymph vessels squeeze, and the fluid move.
Something else you can do is find the reflex point that helps stimulate lymphatic drainage in the upper part of the body. It is located at the bottom part of the breast bone, or sternum. By vigorously rubbing this area for about two minutes, you can stimulate the lymph system. We can also help lymph nodes drain by gently rubbing or milking them toward the heart.
Working away from the heart will only irritate them, so be sure you work toward the heart. Use a lubricant like one of the medicated rubs and start under the jaw and milk down the throat on each side of the big muscle on both sides of the neck.
Then, start at the base of the skull with your thumbs just behind the ears. Push under the skull, into the neck, with firm pressure slowly going toward the collar bone. Continue to do this, and each time move the thumbs closer together toward the spinal column.
Doing this alone has relieved headaches and neck tension. Another tip that will help the lymph system is to take both Vitamin C a natural source of vitamin A. I recommend mg of vitamin C and IU of vitamin A daily.
Now you know something about the lymph system and its workings. If you have any of the problems I mentioned, or if you begin to feel that familiar touch of sore throat, you can take action. Lymphatic congestion or stagnation is a serious problem for many cancer patients. Undigested food, infectious material, dead cells, toxins, and other debris have to be carried off by the lymphatic system.
Thickened and sluggish lymph results in swelling and discomfort. Very few people understand the humble working of the lymphatic system.
Basically, the lymphatic system consists of one-way channels into which excess fluids, called lymph, are absorbed. This fluid consists of waste materials and some white blood cells. It is not under pressure and only moves because of exercise or muscle contraction. Lymph moves towards the heart where it empties into veins.
The two largest areas of lymph collection are just below the clavicles, areas that are often swollen or tender due to congestion in the lymphatic system. The left side carries more fluid than the right, explaining why so many people experience worse swelling on the left side. Many patients suffered from congestion or conditions such as mastitis before developing cancer.
The lymphatic system benefits from alkalization of the diet and improved digestion. As a general rule, there will be only minimal improvement in places such as the axilla or groin until the thoracic duct is freed of stagnation. Angie used a machine to keep the lymph ducts open. She really worked my lymph hard and I felt it immediately. I had developed an ear infection traveling by plane and, within 1 hour, the infection was GONE!
I was advised to drink a lot of water before and after the lymph treatment as water stimulates and drains the lymph. The lymphatic system is unique because it consists of multiple and varied organs that work together to provide a supportive environment for cells.
Specifically, the lymphatic system is composed of organs the spleen, thymus and tonsils , tissues nodes and an intricate network of highly permeable capillaries through which lymph a blend of proteins and fluids flows throughout the body. Lymph contains white blood cells called lymphocytes. Like a team of well-trained maintenance workers, lymphocytes use antibodies to mop up interstitial fluid found between tissues and fluid leaked by blood vessels.
Highly specialized lymph nodes located throughout the body, including clusters in the neck, armpits and groin, act as filtering stations along the network of lymphatic vessels. While the cardiovascular system has the heart working on its behalf to pump blood throughout the body, the lymphatic system has no primary organ to circulate lymph, instead relying on the muscular contractions that accompany exercise and regular movement of the human body. The key is to engage the muscles, joints and ligaments in regular exercise, which keeps lymph flowing through the body so it can carry out its job.
The lymphatic system is distributed throughout the entire body, which means that all components of a healthy lifestyle help it function well. This, of course, includes a healthful diet. Rockwell told me that in healthy people the lymph system pretty much takes care of itself.
Hydration is also important, as is doing all that you can to support proper digestion and enhance absorption of nutrients. During a recent spa visit, I saw something called manual lymphatic drainage massage MLD offered on the menu, so I asked Dr. Rockson whether this is necessary or even helpful. The concept is that manual manipulation of nodes and skin encourages the fluid to circulate, helping the body dispose excess fluid and reduce edema swelling.
This can be helpful for people with lymphedema, but it is a specialized technique that requires medical knowledge, plus at least hours of specific training. Rockwell cautioned, it can be harmful if performed incorrectly, especially for a person with a lymphatic disease, including lymphedema, among others. So, it turns out that the lymphatic system contributes much to our health, while requiring little in terms of special attention — consider it an extra benefit of good health habits that your lymph system functions better, too.

"I know where you are with my eyes closed. We are bound to each other with huge, invisible threads."
Winter Summers 10/11/18 Winter stares at the woman, just stares for what seems like forever. He clears his throat, he could do this. This was easy. "Welcome." Nope this was awkward as ****. "Right I'm gonna go now, glad to see you are still alive. Bye."
br> Turns to leave almost runs right into a wall, turns and smiles pretty at Rhiannon. "Wall right here be careful. It's very dangerous." Hurries to leave, wasn't awkward at all.
Soleil Whitaker 10/11/18 Soleil squints, skeptical of how Rhiannon is now in possession of a hotel keycard. She remains still, breath hitched, when the other woman saunters over, and takes a strand of now dark hair between her fingers. It shouldn’t have taken her this long to realize just who’s standing in front of her - afterall, she’d know the angel anywhere, at any moment.
“Baby?” It comes as a broken whisper. Hands reach out to take Rhiannon’s face between her palms. “It’s you.”
There are tears, now. Soleil leans in to press a firm kiss to her wife’s lips, and is elated to find that the woman with the caramel colored eyes tastes like her angel once more.
Soleil is too busy tapping out a text to notice the sound of the door swinging open. A lot had happened in the few weeks prior - Daniel’s disappearance, Tucker’s passing, Reid Funeral Home’s disbanding. Everything had gone awry, and for Soleil, it was near impossible to suppress the urge to run. Yet, with the help of her sons, the young Whitaker remained in LA, hopeful, patient, waiting.
Suddenly, there’s a new presence in the room, and Soleil’s heart begins to beat wildly against her sternum. She can’t help but noticed that this Rhiannon feels familiar to her. Shock, awe, utter disbelief has her speechless as Rhiannon appears in the doorway. “What- what are you doing here?” she stutters, a hand lifting to clasp over her mouth, “How did you get in?”
The dude behind the counter gave me a dirty look when I said I was just 'attending to my wife in the restroom.'
Soleil Whitaker 04/28/18 The dreary, early spring rain seems appropriate; like Rhiannon, the world is in mourning. Different tones of gray were the only thing to be seen when Soleil stepped onto the pavement, earlier this morning. With a heavy tread, and an equally heavy heart, she’d left Rhiannon, Red Sox hoodie wrapped tightly around her shoulders, to acquire the angel’s most favorite breakfast pastries.
Whether or not her wife realizes, Soleil’s heart is no stranger to grief, having lost three siblings of her own. She’d been conscious to witness paramedics pull Jacy’s mangled body from the car wreck; to know that life had been so forcibly ripped from his lungs made her wish, more than anything, to have switched places.
There are no words spoken as Soleil pulls the angel tightly to her chest. Her steady, stable heartbeat reminding both women of the love they share. After the wreck, Soleil had found herself alone. Completely alone. And so, to the best of her abilities, she pours all the love she had then craved into caring for Rhiannon. Lips pressed to the angel’s hair, arms locked around her shoulders, trying, as if by osmosis, to reassure her that in time, the heart heals.
Soleil Whitaker 04/26/18 Callum's name sends a pang of jealousy rippling through Soleil's already fragile heart. But, this moment is not about her. Nor is it about her more-than-obvious distaste for Rhiannon's ex-husband.
Soleil Whitaker 04/26/18 Soleil had never been known to be an overly emotional creature; years of curtailing any outward expression left her... well, stunted, in a way. Her adoration for Rhiannon often comes out in unorthodox ways - although, over time, the gestures of love had become more intimate, more personal. And because grief and frustration are emotions she still struggles to openly express, the news of Margot's passing is hard to process. But, she knows that her feelings on the matter are trivial in comparison to her wife's.
Soleil Whitaker 04/11/18 Well, if someone had offered a helping hand, maybe I wouldn't be so goddamn tired.
Our SON insists that he needs to jump over every crack in the sidewalk. How about you come pick him up?
Soleil Whitaker 03/14/18 “My pancakes are perfect!” she squeals, kicking her legs, “You’re just mad because Wilson asked me to make breakfast this morning.”
Laughter and hushed pleas of truce carry throughout the brownstone. How the boys remain asleep is nothing short of a miracle; but, both Rhiannon and Soleil are grateful. It’s not until the clock reads long past midnight that the Whitaker women drift off to sleep.
Soleil Whitaker 03/14/18 “I don’t think anyone was, babe,” she replies, stifling a bout of untimely laughter, “He disappeared with no explanation. It’s been months.”
Soleil decides she’s being a touch too insensitive for the present moment, and mutters an apology before pressing another kiss to Rhiannon’s head. “He made you happy,” she whispers, “Perhaps he still does, in one way or another. I didn’t need an explanation, but I’m glad you brought him up.”
The abrupt shift in conversation takes Soleil by surprise. Usually, she’s the one with the fleeting attention span, and ridiculous mood swings. But, the inquiry - or request, perhaps - makes her grin wickedly, regardless. “Do I want to get naked?” she scoffs. Rhiannon already knows the answer.
Soleil Whitaker 03/14/18 She’s tempted to interrupt. She doesn’t need an explanation, doesn’t particularly want Rhiannon to indulge in the details of her past relationship. But, Soleil listens instead, nodding every so often in acknowledgement of what’s being said. And when the angel finishes, they sit, arms wrapped tightly around one another, hearts beating in unison.
“I could never deny your past with Callum. What you had for him, what you still share is sacred to the both of you,” she replies, lifting her free hand to Rhiannon’s cheek, “I understand, I accept that. You are the light of my life, Rhiannon. I trust you.”
Truth is, Soleil has never been more in love. She only wishes she could articulate just how and what she’s feeling. Instead, she pulls Rhiannon into a slow kiss.
Soleil Whitaker 03/14/18 Soleil’s hand drifts to the small of her wife's back, pausing only to trace circles against her bare skin. The sensation of Rhiannon’s lips against her neck elicits a happy hum, and a mumbled “Love you, too” in response. For the first time in what feels like forever, the Whitaker women have a moment to themselves. No boys, no houseguests, no needy (yet, endearingly so) sister-in-law.
“I know, babe,” Soleil promises, shifting to prop herself up on her elbows, “You don’t think I know that?"
Soleil Whitaker 03/14/18 Seeing Callum earlier in the day had thrown Soleil for a loop. She’s never been particularly fond of him, but as an acknowledgement of his past with Rhiannon, she'd made a conscious effort to be a little less vocal about it. She’d seen how his sudden disappearance had affected the Faye sisters - a testament to how deep that bond truly ran. And to make her wife feel guilty about her former marriage would be hypocritical, in a number of ways. She pulls Rhiannon close, lips pressing a firm kiss to her dark hair.
Before Rhiannon can slip away, Callum catches her arm. A quiet moment passes between them before he smiles again. "I'd like that. And for what it's worth, I've missed you, too."
Before even turning around, Callum knows. He'd recognize her voice anywhere. Over the course of 12 years together, he'd familiarized himself with Rhiannon's every tone, voice inflection, and speech pattern. There had even been a time when he could sense her bodily presence.
"I've been... away. I know I have a lot to explain," he says, softly, "I'm sorry. Really." He can't help but smile; it was good to be home, despite his reasons for leaving in the first place.
Oh, I finally got my paycheck for the New Year's gig. And I wanna go on vacation with you and the boys.
Soleil Whitaker 01/10/18 “Never apologize for Q!” she gasps. The small King Charles has become her companion, eagerly trotting alongside her as she mills around the house. Soleil can’t deny the dog a little extra lovin’, despite feeling some regret over the recent neglect of Fish and Luna. She just can’t get over Q’s chocolate colored eyes, and adorable button nose.
Leaning into Rhiannon’s embrace, Soleil lets out a content sigh. The warmth and security she feels here is unparalleled. “I don’t look like I’d rather die,” she protests, lips pressing a gentle kiss to the angel’s neck thereafter, “I just didn’t want to upset you.”
Soleil loves her wife more than anyone or anything else in the world. She is, despite her past transgressions, devoted to Rhiannon in unimaginable ways. And at the end of the day, if the angel really wanted to adopt another child, she’d be met with little protest.
She has no idea how to voice her qualms; she can’t bear to hurt her wife, not after all they’ve been through. But, she had promised to be better about voicing her concerns and expressing her emotions. And the push for more pets and babies has Soleil reeling.
The younger Whitaker shuffles her feet, nervous about her wife’s reaction. Her gaze drops to her feet as she mutters an apology. Eventually, she’d want a daughter - a baby girl to complete the family. But, it just doesn’t feel right. Not yet.
Soleil pushes open the office door, loitering in the door frame for a moment. She knows that Rhiannon has been baby-crazed as of late. The holidays provided an opportunity for the angel to splurge on and spoil their young sons, and Soleil had been all for it. But, perhaps selfishly, she’s had enough of the chaos. Three dogs, three cats, two toddlers. The brownstone has always been their fortress of adoration and security, and of course, the more household members, the better. Realistically, however, the commotion is... a lot.
Soleil Whitaker 01/03/18 “He was metro, then,” she responds, huffing, “But, either way, he was hitting on my wife.” Soleil is a territorial creature by nature - possessive, protective. Especially when it comes to her wife. She’s jealous, yes. But, not insecure.
Just as she gives an eager nod of consent, the doorbell rings. Perfect f*cking timing. “He’ll leave it on the doorstep,” she mutters, pulling Rhiannon close for another slow kiss, “I paid with a card. Included the tip and everything.” Don’t be a tease. Her brow furrows in silent warning, arms tightening around Rhiannon’s waist. She knows that her wife has her tendencies.
Soleil Whitaker 01/02/18 “He was not gay,” Soleil grumbles, frowning at the memory, “He was so unapologetically hitting on you.” She’s constantly appalled by the audacity of the club-going male population, but this particular f*cker was unnecessarily persistent. Rhiannon had even physically deterred his advances; it had taken Soleil every ounce of self-control not to put the sh*thead on his ass.
She pauses, taking a breath to recenter. After clearing her throat, she makes a comment about the tequila. The alcohol had been top-shelf. And free for Soleil and her plus one - perks of being the main act at a bougie club. “I’m glad you had fun, babe,” she muses, letting out a pleased hum thereafter, “It was really nice having you there.”
Soleil smiles against Rhiannon’s hair; the satisfaction and adoration in her heart almost bring tears to her eyes. But, of course, the tenderness of the moment is ruined by her inability to have any chill. “And the after, after party was pretty cool, too."
Soleil Whitaker 01/02/18 “Didn’t you just come from the kitchen?” Soleil teases, eyes squinting at the angel in her lap. Her arms reach around Rhiannon to tug her blanket back, displeased with the abrupt rush of cold air on her vulnerable legs. The couple sits for a moment, the silence only broken by the sound of a happy sigh.
The young Whitaker nudges her wife playfully, thankful for the woman’s warmth and proximity. She’s reaching for her phone before granted a response, and with a couple swift clicks, dumplings, egg rolls and soy sauce are successfully ordered. Her arms wind their way around Rhiannon’s waist, effectively pulling her impossibly close.
“You seemed to enjoy yourself on New Year’s.” A small smirk tugs at the corners of mouth, knowing full well that Rhiannon had, in fact, liquored up and danced the night away.
Soleil Whitaker 12/28/17 Rhiannon’s proximity is enough to make Soleil heave a content sigh. This is exactly what she needs at the end of a holiday weekend - the wife and some wine, the perfect combination. She takes a long sip, free arm wrapping its way around Rhiannon’s slim frame if only to hold her more firmly against her side. Absolute bliss.
Of course, the Whitakers can’t unwind completely. Not yet, at least. Soleil has a huge gig at Output on New Years Eve - the biggest show she’s been booked for, ever. Colin had done the young woman a solid in talking to the nightclub’s management. It’s rare for a small-time DJ, like Soleil, to score a venue at which Diplo and Eric Prdyz had previously performed.
Soleil Whitaker 12/27/17 The brownstone smells of pine, peppermint, and gingerbread. Four of the five Christmas trees have been left out on the curb - the tallest remains, still fully decorated, in the living room. It’s the Wednesday after Christmas, and Soleil is still reeling from the energy and excitement that had filled the house days prior.
A Kiddimoto Marc Márquez Superbike, and a custom made LS2 helmet. A pair of Bauer ice skates. A BB-8 Mega playset with a Jedi costume to match. The Whitakers had spared no expense for their son’s first Christmas, but the expression of utter delight on Wilson’s face made the cost worth it. But, as the holiday season draws to a close, it’s impossible for Soleil not to admit that she’s absolutely beat.
Soleil Whitaker 12/13/17 The bedroom door shuts, and all Soleil can do is blink away hot tears. Rhiannon’s anger is excusable; the younger woman isn’t stupid. But, it hurts. Afterall, her heart still aches at the thought of how she’d betrayed the woman she loves most in this world. It’d been months at this point, but there is no denying how greatly it damaged her moral compass. Now, Logan and his hauntingly blue eyes would act as a constant reminder of her sins.
After what feels like an eternity of standing alone in the hallway, she’s propelled down the stairs and out the front door. Her fingers tap out a short text to Mark, as she swings a leg over the side of the motorcycle. Quickly, she tugs the helmet on, snapping the glass visor down over her eyes and nose. Running is undoubtedly the immature thing to do, but there’s no way she’s going to tread timidly around her own home. Not for being coerced into doing something she knew would result in this kind of tension.
Soleil Whitaker 12/13/17 Soleil is tempted to lie. It’d be easy to say that she’d just been given a pick-up location. She’s tempted to say that she hadn’t seen Elouise, that someone else had handed the child off to her. But, the angel knows her wife, and lying would only stoke the fire. There’s a momentary silence that settles around the couple, disrupted only by the sound of Logan’s gurgling, as Soleil considers her next words.
“I didn’t know what to expect in meeting her, Rhiannon,” she replies, quietly. It’s the truth, and Soleil hopes the angel can identify the remorse in her voice. “I told her we didn’t want Logan. I told her that I didn’t want him. I made it clear that I was done doing her favors. But, she… she just f*cking walked away.”
Soleil knows her wife is upset, and of course, she can’t blame her. Elouise had been the biggest thorn in the couple’s side; there’s no denying that she’d been the root of all their marital troubles, so after the affair, Soleil had been excruciatingly meticulous in ridding her life of all things ‘Orlav.’ But, the word ‘lover’ still stings. So much so that Soleil takes an involuntary step backwards.
The infant is up and out of her arms before she can manage an entire sentence. He giggles, and Soleil revels in the way Rhiannon’s face lights up. She knows, however, that this excitement will be painfully short-lived. A hand reaches up to rub the back of her neck, heart clenching in her chest as her wife finally takes a moment to pause.
Soleil doesn’t exactly know how Rhiannon’s going to react, but she can certainly imagine. Having an Orlav in the house is going to be troublesome for them, both. For their marriage. And it’s exactly this kind of nightmare that the younger Whitaker wanted to avoid. “Logan is” - a pause to clear her throat - “He’s El’s kid.”
She makes a conscious effort to maintain eye contact, even though she can feel Rhiannon tense at the mention of El’s name. “Hear me out, baby. Please,” she begs before her wife has a moment to respond.
It had been life or death for Logan Orlav. Despite her reluctance, despite how she felt for Elouise, Soleil had been backed into a corner. Soft at heart, she couldn’t - no, she wouldn’t - possibly leave the child to die, either by his own mother’s hand, or otherwise. He was human, afterall. Innocent and pure, despite his parents’ transgressions. Soleil could understand this. But, for Rhiannon? Being an Orlav was enough of a crime.
Soleil Whitaker 12/12/17 Soleil stands out on the pavement, carseat and infant in one hand, helmet in the other. She stares up at her home, wondering just how she’d managed to transport Logan safely on the motorcycle. It’s nothing short of a miracle, really. She glances down, catching another glimpse of those familiar, clear blue eyes. Then, her feet carry her up the steps, and into the front hall.
Her heart is racing as she ventures further into the brownstone. If her wife possessed lycan abilities, she’d already be aware of the tiny, new heartbeat. Steady, stable, alive. Logan squeaks as she scoops him into her arms.
“Oh, ****,” she whispers, making her way up to Rhiannon’s study, “What have I done?” She’s already anticipating the barrage of questions and queries. Quite frankly, she knows it’s game over once Rhiannon realizes the child is an Orlav.
I'm lost without you, you know? I don't know what to do with myself. Having Wilson helps, he keeps me preoccupied. But, at the end of the day, I don't want an empty bed. I want you.
I have acknowledged, on multiple occasions, that you are supporting this family. I can't do what you do.
It's my fault that you have to work so much. I should've known. And I feel like sh*t because I'm angry that you're always working. It kills me whenever Wilson asks why you're not home. And then I realize I'm just throwing myself another f*cking pity party.
Let me ask you this. What's the biz with you lately, hm? What's been going on with you? Trouble with the co-workers? D*ck of a boss, maybe? Particular nuisance of a client?
I haven't had a full conversation with my own wife in the last, f*ck if I know how long. This isn't just about me, it's about you too. That's the way a marriage works, Rhiannon. Why am I always the only one who has to open up?
Go check on Wilson, babe. He asked me about why you haven't been home lately. Again. He's been missing you.
Plus, he got a little frosting happy today. I know it's going to take a chisel to clean it up if I don't get to it soon.
I'm not f*cking qualified to work, to support a family. We don't have any other options, and I know it's hard for you to be away so much. It's hard for the both of us, but...
I can be independent, you know. I know I'm childish sometimes, but I can do things on my own. I don't need you to tend to every decision or move I make.
I just didn't want to burden you with planning a vacation. You've been... busy supporting us. And it's the holiday season, so I just figured you'd be swamped.
Just so you know, though... Wilson's been sleeping on your side, and I think he's gonna be reluctant to give that up.
Sriracha nuggets are no different than tater-tots fried in truffle oil. Restaurants make fancy finger food all the time.
You know, chicken nuggets dipped in Sriracha mayo should be put on a bar menu. Sh*t's actually pretty good.
Soleil Whitaker 10/12/17 Rhiannon’s 'closet commentary' warrants a playful shove from the younger woman. Her breath hitches in the back of her throat as her lower back connects with the marble counter. She’s mesmerized by Rhiannon’s moving lips, eyes unapologetically fixated on them. The only thought present in the confines of her skull is of how those lips are going to feel against her pallid skin.
She nods eagerly, and she knows it’s sufficient enough of a response for Rhiannon to take control. “I love you,” she states firmly, taking the angel’s face in her hands. Hazel eyes stare for what feels like an eternity.
“I’m so in love with you.” She reaffirms the statement with a fervid kiss, teeth and tongue soon battling for control. Soleil Whitaker is not capable of expressing the amount of love she holds in her heart. Instead, she pours all of her emotions into the way she makes love to her wife, constantly hoping and praying that it’ll be just enough for Rhiannon to know.
Soleil Whitaker 10/11/17 She knows Rhiannon is speaking; her lips are moving, after all. But, Soleil is too distracted by the sight of her wife to be fully attentive. There’s something about how her hair is thrown messily into a bun, glasses now perched on the top of her head. It’s the effortless beauty that drives Soleil wild.
The confession is intended as a response to Rhiannon’s question. But, just with the way Soleil had blurted it out, it becomes the epitome of her current mindset. She is gay, and her wife is an absolute goddess.
Her hands slip under the hem of the Red Sox hoodie, and she hums in response to the warmth she finds against Rhiannon’s skin. She leans in close, leaving just enough room for the hushed words shared between she and her wife. “I missed you today,” she whispers, fingers dancing up the length of her spine. Her eyes slide shut, and she revels in how Rhiannon’s heart skips a beat. She has half a mind to pull the sweatshirt off. Instead, her move around to her chest only to cop an unabashed feel.
She whines when Rhiannon holds her at arm’s length. “We’re friends,” she responds, a hint of impatience apparent in her tone. Conversation is the very last thing Soleil is capable of focusing on in this moment. Rhiannon’s mile-long legs are demanding her attention, and it takes every ounce of willpower not to lay her wife out on the kitchen counter just to have her way. “He has no intentions. I, on the other hand, have intentions with you.”
Soleil Whitaker 10/11/17 Soleil mumbles to herself, searching, bleary-eyed, for a bottle of water. She wonders why and how she’d arrived at this level of intoxication so quickly - she’d felt near sober when leaving the bar. Focus, Soleil.
On an empty stomach. She’d agreed to meet up with Mark after dinner, and it hadn’t quite occurred to her that ‘dinner’ now constituted as Wilson’s leftovers (read: 2 chicken nuggets, and a juicebox). Good. Her grumbling is interrupted by the sound of Rhiannon’s voice. Like a Golden Retriever puppy, she is beyond excited to see her wife. A bright smile splits her features, arms immediately slipping around the other woman’s slim waist.
“Love of my life. The mother of my son. My moon, and my” - she pauses for another kiss - “you taste like wine.”
It’s a stupid, rhetorical question. But, a knowing grin tugs at the corner of her mouth. “Did you finish the bottle, yet?"
Soleil Whitaker 10/11/17 Soleil could sense the urgency - impatience, rather - in her wife’s text messages. ‘I want to talk’ had become code for sex; she figured that out rather quickly. Rhiannon’s latest text is a blatant indication of just how desperate the couple had become for moments of intimacy.
Pulling up to the brownstone, Soleil lets out a relieved sigh. It probably hadn’t been the smartest of ideas for the young Whitaker to drive home, but she hadn’t exactly anticipated having 3 drinks. She dismounts the motorcycle, taking a rather unsteady step onto the curb thereafter. Somehow, she manages to tug off her helmet while stumbling up the front steps.
“Rhiannon!” she calls, pushing into to the front hall, “Sh*t, sorry.” The apology isn’t directed at anyone in particular, but she quickly realizes that in order to keep her son from waking up, she needs to be quiet. Tiptoeing into the kitchen, she attempts to juggle her phone and her helmet with the same hand. This proves to be an impossible task, so she sets the helmet down, takes a deep breath, and taps out a quick message to her wife.
I know all white men are the same to you, but I have two friends in the city. Not hard to keep track of. ;)
Just know that I opened a bottle of Chateau Petrus. There's a glass waiting on the coffee table for you, if you choose to stay up a little while longer.
Soleil Whitaker 10/09/17 Soleil’s hands move to Rhiannon’s hips; she squeezes affectionately, fingers pressing themselves into soft flesh. The weight of her wife in her lap is almost enough to drive her wild, but it’s the sensation of Rhiannon’s teeth against her skin that rips a moan from the back of her throat.
Her head lulls back against the couch before she can finish the thought. Rhiannon is well aware of how easily aroused her wife is; so much as one look with bedroom eyes is enough to send Soleil’s heart rate through the roof.
“Great surprise,” she finally manages, eyes sliding shut as Rhiannon’s teeth continue to nip at sensitive skin. “You take my breath away.”
Soleil wracks her brain, trying to figure out what exactly she and her wife have to discuss. It’s been a while since they’ve argued, even longer since they’d addressed the affair. But, insecurity plagues her mind as she paces the living room floor. At the sound of the front door opening, she downs the remainder of her beer, and then throws herself onto the couch in attempt to appear nonchalant.
She hears nothing but the greeting, utterly distracted by the way the trench coat hugs the angel’s curves. Her mouth falls open as Rhiannon steps closer.
Her hands reach out before her own brain can register the movement, fingers finding the trim of the coat. She tugs Rhiannon closer, shifting herself toward the edge of the couch. With her wife standing in between her legs, Soleil leans in to press a gentle kiss to Rhiannon’s toned abdomen. Murmuring, she reaches around to cop an unabashed feel.
Soleil Whitaker 09/15/17 “Rhiannon,” Soleil growls. To say she’s not easily frustrated by this woman would be a blatant lie. She’s an absolute sucker for her wife, despite the games Rhiannon likes to play. Already on the verge of taking matters into her own hands, Soleil grits her teeth, fingers finding their way into waves of dark hair.
“You know what kind of kisses.” Her head lulls back against the couch, eyes sliding shut as Rhiannon’s lips continue to explore her pale skin. Soleil is sometimes convinced that the angel will someday be the death of her. But, who is she, really, to complain?
Soleil Whitaker 09/15/17 Soleil squirms under Rhiannon’s drifting hands, a short breath escaping from between her lips. She’s very aware of the woman’s intentions; after all, Rhiannon has never been known to be… subtle in regards to their sex life.
Her back arches in response to coaxing hands, torso pressing more firmly against the other woman. It is safe to say that Soleil Whitaker is having trouble catching her breath. “Rhiannon,” she mumbles. She makes an attempt to protest against her wife’s unabashed f*ckboy mentality, but finds herself leaning closer for a kiss.
Soleil Whitaker 09/14/17 “I was just about to ask,” she responds, hands reaching to grasp at her wife’s wrists. She squints at her in silent warning; Soleil Whitaker absolutely cannot be held accountable for any harm done while being tickled. Rhiannon knows this.
“You’re gonna let me drive?” She’s almost shocked. The Mustang is Rhiannon’s prized possession - Soleil feels blessed to even sit in the car, let alone drive it. She finds herself nodding, excited by the prospect of being behind the wheel.
“Can I kiss you at all the red lights?” she inquires, a sheepish grin tugging at her lips. She knows she doesn’t have to ask permission, but she can’t seem to help herself.
Soleil Whitaker 09/14/17 The electricity between Rhiannon and Soleil had been undeniable from the beginning, but there is an unparalleled sensation in this particular moment. The air is knocked from the younger Whitaker’s lungs, and she’s left utterly breathless when Rhiannon pulls away from their kiss.
“Hey,” she breathes. She presses her lips to the angel’s hair, convinced that, in these moments, she’s catching glimpses of Heaven. Nothing feels better than Rhiannon’s body pressed against her own, arms wrapped around each other, fingers idly brushing against skin. The desire for constant physical contact is, perhaps, a little excessive. But, for Soleil, it’s what keeps her grounded.
Darling, gorgeous, all-too-generous wife of mine, will you please come to bed so I can f*ck you senseless?
Oh, NO. We do NOT have a child. This baby is literally someone else's. A crew member of Camille's. Seriously, though. He's yours if you want him.
I don't want to talk about chocolate. I've been elbow deep in baby sh!t for the past 24 hours and I have no will to live remaining.
I just opened a bottle of red. Was thinking we could snuggle, drink wine, and find something new to watch?
I'd only leave if you asked, Rhiannon. And even then, I'd wait, just in case you ever wanted me back.
I want to die, all the time. I can't stand how I've hurt you. Because you trusted me. And I f*cked it up.
Soleil Whitaker 08/26/17 “I know,” she responds, “You need time. There’s no rush.” Soleil allows for the angel to coax her toward the bed, guiding her along with tender kisses and whispered assertions of love and comfort. Validation that she does not deserve, by any means. And it almost behooves her to put a stop to it.
Rhiannon’s touch feels too much like normalcy for Soleil, too much like the last 48 hours had been nothing but a nightmare. In that moment, it is clear that both women need a break from their pain and anxieties. Soleil doesn’t quite know how or why she is still residing within the confines of the brownstone. But, for now, Rhiannon is dictating what is and isn’t to happen in their marriage. And if it’s in sex and intimacy that she finds her escape, Soleil is more than willing to oblige.
Soleil Whitaker 08/25/17 She doesn't dare press her lips to Rhiannon's; that kind of intimacy had been become forbidden the second she'd fallen into bed with Elouise. Instead, she dips her hand between the angel's thighs, fingertips trailing down the length of her abdomen. Eyes open, staring up at the only person who possesses the power to crush her will to live. The languidness and the timidity in the way Soleil's fingers work express the unfathomable sorrow she feels building in her chest.
Soleil can feel just how heartbroken the angel is. She doesn't cling to Soleil's slight frame the way she used to, her hands to wander, lips don't pepper her skin with affectionate kisses. Even her labored breath sounds different.
And when they're done, Soleil can only watch as Rhiannon crawls away. The physical separation is agonizing.
And everything feels empty. The room. Her chest cavity. The sex. Rhiannon's eyes as she peers back at the younger woman.
Soleil Whitaker 08/25/17 Soleil fidgets when Rhiannon disappears into the bathroom, fingers fiddling with her wedding band. The sound of a running faucet causes the young woman to figure that Rhiannon has made her decision, that she is quite literally washing her hands of their marriage. Her eyes slide shut, a broken sigh forced from between her lips. She deserves this.
She almost jumps when Rhiannon’s fingers still her own. The contact is unexpected, and she stares - just as Rhiannon does - at their entangled hands. It isn’t until the angel speaks that Soleil realizes she’s been asked to stay. She looks up, and her breath hitches as Rhiannon’s lips press to the corner of her mouth. The smell of toothpaste is better than that of vanilla dipped donuts - anything to overwhelm and erase the reminder of her infidelity that had stained the inside of her nostrils.
Involuntarily, she lets out a sigh of relief. Her chest is still tight with humiliation and guilt, but hearing those words makes her heart leap. As unnatural as it may seem, Soleil has a feeling that their relationship may be stronger in hindsight.
Soleil Whitaker 08/25/17 She had thought of everything she had to lose. She’d spent close to 12 consecutive hours thinking of all the consequences of her actions, only when it became too unbearable to think about did she resort to alcohol as a distraction. She’d spent the majority of the flight from Moscow wringing her hands in agony and distress. But, Rhiannon would never come to know that.
As tempted as she is to respond with anger, Soleil knows that she’s at fault. She can’t compare her sins to Rhiannon’s; the circumstances had been much different. Instead, she listens. She takes the verbal barrage, head hung in palpable shame. Her silence is not an indication of surrender because she is, at the end of the day, prepared to fight tooth and nail for this woman. But, control lies in solely Rhiannon's hands, and it is Soleil's conscious choice to let her decide.
But, when the angel vomits, Soleil moves swiftly to help her wife. She’s prepared for the angel to push her away, to deny her the comfort of physical contact, to refuse her aid. But, she can’t stop herself. She’s wired that way.
“Just say the word,” she whispers finally, pushing herself up and away from her trembling wife. If there is one thing Rhiannon knows about the young Whitaker, it’s that she is incorrigibly selfish. She will run as far as, and as fast as she can from her troubles. And if Rhiannon wants her gone, Soleil is already halfway there.
It’s the truth. Soleil may have loved Elouise Orlav at some point, but never in the way she loves her wife. Her attraction to Elouise started out as a fascination - the tall blonde had been the first to show Soleil any kind of attention and affection, and it made her feel wanted, for once. But, Elouise was married. And Jameson was her boss. So, she moved on.
Soleil begins to step forward, but stops herself. How quickly she forgets that she is not at any liberty to touch her wife.
If she could give Rhiannon her beating heart, she would. Just to prove that she’d do anything for her. She’d told herself not to beg, but suddenly, she finds words of desperation spilling from between her lips.
Soleil Whitaker 08/25/17 She’s never seen her wife look so small, and it sends cracks rippling through the very last piece of her already fragile heart. “I…” she chokes, tears once more spilling down her cheeks. She feels violently nauseous at the prospect of saying it out loud, and so, her mouth snaps shut, lips press themselves into a thin line.
Soleil doesn’t flinch when Rhiannon lifts her hand. In fact, she almost wishes that the angel would strike her because physical pain is quantifiable. And much easier to endure than emotional or mental agony. So, she looks up with pleading eyes, as if to say ‘distract me from this heartache.’
Soleil Whitaker 08/25/17 It doesn’t take her long to get to the hotel. The woman at the concierge desk is pleasant, and Soleil almost manages a smile. The elevator ride up is long as dread begins to settle in. She pauses just before swiping the keycard.
Soleil shakes the thought from her skull. She wants this, she wants Rhiannon. And the family. The future they’d planned. She wants it all, even if she’s no longer entitled to it. Pushing through the door, she can hear Rhiannon’s heartbeat, which immediately dispels some of the tension held in her muscles.
Soleil has no knowledge of how much time has passed when her phone lets out a shrill ring. She’d been staring at the same spot on the adjacent wall for so long that her vision had long since blurred. Her bones let out a whine when she moves to take her phone from the coffee table.
She stares at the blue iMessage bubble, almost confused by the request. But, she is quick to respond, fingers deftly tapping out a response.
Soleil Whitaker 08/24/17 The pain becomes unbearable when Rhiannon turns and disappears out the front door. There is nothing for Soleil to do but collapse against the doorframe, a broken wail torn from the back of her throat. She’d held it together for the flight back, but now… in an empty house, surrounded by memories of a love she betrayed, she crumbles.
She can’t bear to think of the family she’d planned to build with Rhiannon. She can’t stand to think of the ways they’ll have to pretend when Susanne brings Wilson over in the morning. But, when the timer sounds, she drags herself to her feet, and takes the cupcakes out of the oven, frosting them neatly only after they’ve cooled.
Soleil stands in the middle of the kitchen - of their kitchen - for a while, fingers picking nervously at her calluses. Then, her feet are carrying her up the stairs, and into the bedroom. There are things she needs to pack, things she needs to put away in the event that Rhiannon decides that things are over. It’s a slow, agonizing process, but undeniably necessary. When she is done, she leaves the packed bags in the front hall closet, out of the purview of cautious, judging eyes (namely, Susanne).
Soleil Whitaker 08/24/17 Time slows as Rhiannon moves to collect her belongings, and Soleil lifts her gaze just enough to watch the woman she loves distance herself. Her heart aches, but there’s a part of her that knows she deserves everything that’s coming to her.
The angel’s response is surprisingly calm, and it is only in the given situation that Soleil would much prefer explosive anger. She could handle yelling and screaming because at least, then, she’d know just how Rhiannon is feeling. But, the resignation expressed in the pair of simple “okay’s” rips Soleil’s beating heart right out from the middle of her chest.
She so desperately wants to reach out and stop the woman from leaving. But, she knows she is no longer entitled to physical contact.
Soleil shuffles past her wife. She finds no reason for begging - not for the sake of her pride (for she has none in this moment), but rather for the simple fact that it’d be a waste of Rhiannon’s time. She loves the angel vehemently, and will continue to do so for the rest of her days. But, the fate of their marriage is no longer in her hands. She’s made her bed. Now, she must sleep in it. Alone.
Soleil Whitaker 08/24/17 “Hey,” she breathes as Rhiannon throws her arms around her neck. Instinctively, Soleil pulls her close. Even with the amount of anguish she holds in chest, she can’t help it. But, it’s only a mere moment until she pushes the angel away.
Although she is already missing the way Rhiannon feels against her, Soleil feels dirty. Tainted. Too disgraced for her own wife to touch her. It’s impossible for her to keep her sins concealed from the one person who knows her best. But, she doesn’t know where to start.
Soleil remembers how broken and inconsolable Rhiannon had been when she'd returned home after her affair with Callum, her ex-husband. And in this moment, it’s not just remorse that drives her away from the woman. It’s an abhorrence for herself and for her actions, for the way she’d violated her promise to her wife, for the indubitable heartbreak she’s about to cause.
Truth is, Soleil is standing on the curb, staring up at the brownstone that had become her fortress of unwavering love and trust. But after last night, trust does not, and cannot, exist in the Whitaker household.
With a shaky breath, the young woman trudges up the front steps, pushing through the front door thereafter. “Rhiannon?” she calls, dropping her bag in the front hall. Silently, she pads into the kitchen, where she knows her wife is baking cupcakes in preparation of their adoptive son’s visit.
The concept sends shards of regret and shame through her heart, and she almost reaches up to press a palm to her sternum. She can’t bare to look at the woman with caramel colored eyes as she loiters in the doorframe. The temptation to flee is almost overwhelming - her bag is packed already, so all she needs to do is pick it up and run.
Soleil Whitaker 08/18/17 Intimacy is something that Soleil Whitaker has become very familiar with, especially when her wife is involved. There is no doubt that she is, in every way possible, addicted. On occasion, insecurity overwhelms her, and Soleil gets caught up on the thought that their relationship is nothing more than physical. But, of course, it spans beyond that.
Soleil pours her heart into the way she kisses Rhiannon, and she hopes her wife knows, in that moment, that no one and nothing else matters. “You are absolutely everything to me,” she murmurs as their lips part, “I’m crazy in love with you."
How about we head home? We can take a bath, finish that bottle of Chateaux Petrus. Cuddle? Watch TV?
Soleil Whitaker 08/17/17 I don't like knowing that I got carried away. Some of your bruises are dark, baby.
Soleil Whitaker 08/17/17 I meant to make up for that. But, thanks for making me feel worse about it.
Of course I missed you. I went for a swim. Some woman tried to chat me up as I was getting out of the water. But, I yelled that I had a wife, and then sprinted up here.
"Well, alrighty then. I'll make no comments about butts. Well, her butt. Or yours. My wife has a nice tush, though. And I'm pretty sure she'll kill anyone who looks at MY tush. So pretty much like you guys. Right?"
"I could answer that question, but you have a very scary sounding wife who is prepared to rip out my throat at the first sign of trouble." -shifty eyes- "Yes. I do believe you're my work wife."
Atticus Hammond 08/15/17 He lets out an audible sigh. "Lesbians. Thank god." He then pauses with an absolutely bewildered expression. "Sorry, you just wouldn't believe the day I'm having. It's like I'm giving off some sort of pheromone. That would be a yes for dinner, so long as it's beer, and every sentence has a ten word limit."
Atticus Hammond 08/15/17 Atticus stares at the woman. And stares. Because, honestly, these people were way too friendly for his tastes. Save Mackenzie, who is far wittier than him, and keeps him on his toes. He looks at this 'Rhiannon' with widening gray eyes, offering his palm over before he truly knows how to react. "Ah. Well, hi, Rhiannon. You obviously know I'm Atticus. It's... Nice to meet you." He watches as she scrawls out her number on his palm, noting to himself he would have to transfer it to his phone before it smeared. "Let's sit in awkward silence sometime soon. 'Kay?"
Blanket forts always seem to put you in the mood, and I want to show you just how much I missed you today.
Spending time with you is my favorite thing to do, baby. I can die happy just knowing that you're mine.
I wanted to kiss you in Wendy's. On the first day we met. You were... I have no words to describe how stunning you were.
If your sister needs to go to the hospital because she's proven you wrong, you'll be the one to take her.
I just... she only calls when it's a real emergency. Not like, you know, an 'Elouise Orlav' emergency.
Soleil Whitaker 07/18/17 They don't matter because they only woman I'm thinking of right now is you.
I will never have the words to express how much you mean to me, Rhiannon. And, as you know, I've never been good with words, anyways.
Words aren't enough, so my actions need to make up for that. And it's not just sex, it's the small gestures too. I don't think I express it enough.
Soleil Whitaker 07/18/17 I don't want you to ever be under the impression that I don't like the way you touch me. I just...
You could've just waited, you know... a few minutes. It's too early for me to be up and active, you know that.
Soleil Whitaker 07/12/17 I just... I'm probably not going to see her for a while after we leave, you know?
When I get back from dinner with El? I didn't get her Taco Bell last night, so I owe her dinner tonight.
Noura Orlav. Jameson's sister. I tried to nab her wallet when I saw her at the Compound a few days ago. A couple a quick bucks, you know?
And then I think a bit of downtime is in order. Just us, the dogs, the kittens, our home. Sound okay?
Soleil Whitaker 07/07/17 A low growl erupts from the back of Soleil’s throat, and almost instantaneously, she has Rhiannon on her back. She knows her wife is simply goading her, but it’s easy (and mutually beneficial) to play into. She leans in to press a kiss to her wife’s neck, gradually shifting to pepper her chest and collarbones with affection. “I f*cking love you,” she murmurs, fingertips ghosting over bare skin, “You’re so goddamn beautiful.”
She glances up to catch a glimpse of Rhiannon’s expression. Grinning, she adds, “It’s too bad you’re going to have to cover up after I’m done with you."
Soleil Whitaker 07/07/17 “You always know what’s going on in my head, Rhiannon,” she states, sure that her wife knows her mind is only ever on the love of her life. There is no room in the confines of her head to fit anything other than thoughts of the angel.
She sits up some, hands finding their way under Rhiannon’s shirt. “As for what I want to do to her, well…” - a smirk takes command of her lips - “I guess you’ll have to wait and see. Perhaps tonight? If you're up for some fun?"
Soleil Whitaker 07/07/17 Soleil lets out an involuntary whimper. F*ck. The sensation of Rhiannon’s teeth and lips against her neck is almost overwhelming at this hour, and she shifts in attempt to gain some control. But, her wife is stronger than she looks, and with knees planted firmly on the mattress, hands tangled in blonde hair, she is almost immovable. Soleil's eyes widen at Rhiannon’s final assertion.
“Are you sure?” she inquires, eyes scanning the angel’s face for any trace of uncertainty. So trusting and confident in her love for Rhiannon, Soleil sees flirting as a game. Harmless? For the Whitaker women, yes. Manipulative? More so than Soleil cares to admit. Her new friend, Vee, is simply caught in the middle.
Soleil Whitaker 07/07/17 Soleil is jolted out of a peaceful slumber by the sound of her wife's shrieking voice. She lifts her arms to shield her face from an onslaught.
She blinks a few times, her enraged wife coming into focus finally. Her fingers find their way around Rhiannon's wrists, and she tugs her arms down to her sides. "Baby," she coos, "You're not going to prison. Vee is a friend. You know you're the only one for me." She stares up at the woman, gaze soft with genuine love and adoration. She's surprised, and frankly, rather wounded by Rhiannon's outburst - surely her wife knows that she has no intention of being more than friends with Vee.
Rhiannon. I know you're not their biggest fan, but they were my parents. They did provide for me, you know.
I'm sorry I left without saying anything. I should've at least left a note. My head has been in all different places lately.
Soleil Whitaker 07/03/17 Funny you should say that, I was just thinking about that time on the hood of the Mustang. Outside the brownstone? Remember?
I think Margot's a little too preoccupied with the Russian dolls she bought to notice, babe. She's... like, fascinated?
You can hold on to the sides of the counter if need be. And if you think you're going to be too loud, let me know what you'd like to bite down on.
Soleil Whitaker 06/30/17 “You’ve got a one track mind tonight, gorgeous,” Soleil laughs, hands finding their place on Rhiannon’s thighs. She nods in silent consent, letting her wife know that is exactly what she wants now, and always. A lifetime of love, intimacy and sex with Rhiannon is more than Soleil could ask for.
The confession is simple, but resolute. A total sap at heart, Soleil makes note of all the small, seemingly trivial things she loves about her wife. She has two favorite sounds in this world, both of which pertain to the woman with caramel colored eyes: one, her heartbeat, and two, the way ‘I love you’ tumbles from between her lips.
Soleil Whitaker 06/30/17 “Why did you?” she asks before letting out a startled yelp. She doesn’t press for an answer, entirely distracted by the way Rhiannon has woman-handled her. She can only manage to squeak out a ‘yes’ in response.
Soleil Whitaker 06/30/17 This return to normalcy is exactly what she needs, and Soleil can’t help but roll her eyes at the showing of Rhiannon’s f*ckboy nature. She smiles against her wife’s lips, heart fluttering against her ribcage as she leans in for another kiss.
“I love you,” she whispers as she is pulled onto the couch and into Rhiannon’s arms, “You’re my whole heart. My everything.” She takes a moment to caress her cheek, eyes scanning her face, and committing it to memory just as she’s done countless times before. She’ll never get over just how breathtaking Rhiannon is. Every day by her side is nothing short of a blessing.
Soleil Whitaker 06/30/17 Soleil lets out a breathy laugh as she presses her face to Rhiannon’s neck. “I’m sorry, beautiful,” she mutters, “Thank you for letting me sleep, though.” Feeling refreshed, she’s in high spirits, the events of the past days a distant memory in the back of her mind. For the moment, at least.
She shakes her head. Truth be told, the only thing she’s hungry for is intimacy with her wife. Her arms find their way around her slim waist, pulling her up against her body. “Could we just” - she pauses to nod in the direction of the couch - “Sit? Netflix, maybe? Mindless tv? I just… I need to be close to you."
Soleil Whitaker 06/30/17 Soleil is beyond disoriented when she wakes. She jolts upright, eyes searching for any indication of the time. Groaning, she flops back against the pillows, realizing she’d slept the entire day away. She swings her legs over the side of the bed, muscles protesting against the swift motion, and slowly, she shuffles out into the rest of the apartment in search of her wife.
The young woman nods as added affirmation, and her hands immediately return to Rhiannon’s hips. This is the most alive she’s felt in days, and silently, she thanks God for the woman in her arms, acknowledging that without her, she’d be… well, not here, and not who she is now.
More ‘I love you’s’ slip past her lips as Rhiannon undresses her slowly, peppering her bare skin with gentle kisses. This is good - this feels even better. In this current moment, Soleil finds the calmness and the security she’s been craving in the last few days. In Rhiannon’s arms, she finds heaven.
Soleil Whitaker 06/29/17 Naturally, she begins to apologize once more, but is interrupted by a lingering kiss. The sides of her mouth tug upwards into a small smile as she revels in how sweet Rhiannon’s lips taste - once again reminded of how much she loves kissing her wife.
“I missed this,” she sighs, settling in, “I missed you so much.” Her fingers tangle themselves into Rhiannon’s dark locks, tugging her back into another kiss. This one is desperate, and soon it’s a clash of teeth and tongue. Her hands begin to wander from her hair to her hips, fingers grasping to pull her closer. But suddenly, she leans away, breathless. This moment is not about sex, and she is not one to make her wife feel obligated to comply. As much as she missed her, Soleil is content with simply laying in her arms.
Soleil Whitaker 06/29/17 All Soleil can manage through her sobbing are broken apologies. At this point, she’s asking forgiveness for a multitude of things - for her reluctance to open up, for her temper, for the things she cannot express, for the choices she may or may not have to make moving forward. She knows that Rhiannon hadn’t asked for something like this in loving her; she’s aware that there are many things she needs to work on to be a better wife.
But, in this moment, nothing hurts more than knowing that Rhiannon is asking for something Soleil is not capable of doing. Yet.
It is next to impossible for the young Whitaker to just rely on someone other than herself. She has been conditioned to be independent, to rely on nothing but her own capabilities. And as inconvenient - and perhaps, hurtful - as it is to Rhiannon and their relationship, it is not a habit that is easily broken. But, for this woman, Soleil would move mountains.
Her arms unwind from her own frame, and find their way around Rhiannon. “I’m sorry,” she repeats, face pressed to her wife’s neck, “I love you. I do. Always. I’ll be better. I promise.”
She looks up through watery eyes, and Rhiannon is just as beautiful - if not even more so - as the first time she laid eyes on her. She cannot help but lean in to press a kiss to her lips, hoping to somehow convey how much love she holds in her heart for the angel.
She’s not fine, and she knows it. Memories she’d repressed years ago are flooding back into her consciousness, streaming through her purview and disrupting not only her sleep cycle and eating habits, but also the way in which she interacts with others. She can feel her heart breaking in her chest, knowing that the things that haunt her - the things she cannot share with Rhiannon - are just adding insult to injury.
She sighs, head dropping forward in defeat. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. The things I’ve seen are unfathomable, the things I know now are… I can't…”
She stops, tears of her own now cascading down her cheeks. An involuntary wail is ripped from the back of her throat, the pressure and stress of the last 72 hours finally bubbling over. She crumples to the floor, arms wrapping around her torso. It is a pathetic scene to be witness to, but Soleil Whitaker has finally found her breaking point.
Soleil Whitaker 06/29/17 Soleil has had very little to say up until this point. With all that is happening at the Compound, all that is going on in her head, she has found it difficult to form and use words on her own. Even in reuniting with her wife earlier in the day, words were scarce. But, the sheer magnitude of Rhiannon’s sadness has her rocked.
“I am not asking you to leave me,” she hisses back, jumping to her own feet as Rhiannon gets up. She stalks to the opposite side of the room, fists clenching and unclenching at her sides. She takes a breath before allowing the words to tumble from her mouth. It takes every ounce of self-control not to raise her voice; as angry as she is, even she knows that yelling is not an effective way to communicate.
“It is a struggle because you have the audacity to come here when I asked you to stay in New York. You’ve completely disregarded my wishes because what? You know better?”
Her demeanor shifts, then, from outrage to anguish. "And it’ll be on my head if something happens to you…"
Soleil blinks her eyes open at the sound of her wife’s voice. The statement doesn’t register at first; Soleil is too preoccupied with the sensation of having Rhiannon close. Arms weave their way around her slim waist, pulling their bodies flush; lips find their way once more to Rhiannon’s own.
Abruptly, she pulls away and sits upright, pressing her back to the headboard. “But, that doesn’t mean I’m not upset,” she confesses, “I told you to stay in New York.”
Soleil knows (and accepts) that it is the angel's duty to protect her. But, she doesn’t understand how Rhiannon could be so remiss in listening to her own wife. The young woman cannot seem to express how dangerous it is for Rhiannon to be in Moscow - with Jameson Orlav missing and his wife amidst what some would call a psychotic break, there is no way of guaranteeing her safety. And Soleil is angry with the prospect of allowing harm to come to her.
But, the young woman is terrible at expressing her emotions and articulating her innermost thoughts; it is simply not in her nature to do so. Instead, she crosses her arms over her chest, as if to close off her heart to the one person she knows loves her unconditionally.
Soleil Whitaker 06/29/17 The shock and horror of the Orlav laboratory has taken a toll on Soleil's physical and emotional well-being. It is amazing, even in the short 3 days she's been in Russia, how quickly things have changed.
She eats slowly, utensils held precariously in her hands. To her surprise, her body does not revolt against the newly acquired sustenance. Instead, she lets out an involuntary bum of satisfaction as she downs another piece of quiche. She complies when her wife takes hold of her waist, and guides her to the bedroom.
"I know," she responds, fingertips reaching out to trace Rhiannon's facial features, "I trust you." For the first time in days, her eyelids begin to slide shut, and Soleil doesn't fight to stay awake.
Soleil Whitaker 06/29/17 Soleil shuffles into her Moscow apartment. She is angry, of course - irate, even, with how Rhiannon had so blatantly disregarded her wishes. But, her heart softens some as she catches a glimpse of her wife standing in the kitchen. Soleil drops her bag, and hastily collects Rhiannon up into her arms, lips immediately finding the pair she’d missed so much. ‘I love you's’ and ‘I missed you's’ are spilling from her mouth before Rhiannon can manage a response of her own.
This is the most secure she’s felt in days. She is sleep-deprived, and starving; the mere mention of homemade quiche had her mouth watering during her commute to the Arbat district. Her pale complexion exacerbates the dark circles that have formed under her eyes, and her typical posture has been reduced to a hung head and drooping shoulders.
“I’m sorry,” she whispers, still clinging to her wife. The angel will take the apology for last night’s insolent behavior. But, Soleil is apologizing for much more than her callous demeanor.
I know that it must be strange for you to hear, but you do not know the things I have seen here in the last 48 hours.
The text isn't intended to be dismissive, but 'delivered' pops up underneath the text bubble before Soleil can change the wording. She's already cringing, confident that Rhiannon will read it in it's unintentional voice of contempt. Quickly, she taps out another message.
Can we FaceTime? I want your face to be the last thing I see before I fall asleep. As if I was home with you.
How about when you get back from your walk? I'll watch you make dinner. I don't care that it'll be 1 am.
Funny story: I thought the small bottles of wine were complimentary.... racked up a nice bill for myself, instead.
Soleil Whitaker 06/27/17 "I'd crawl through Heaven and Hell to come home to you," she murmurs, "I'd die for you, Rhiannon Whitaker."
The words come out strangled, but she hopes that her wife will know them to be true. Desperation is palpable in the way she presses her lips to Rhiannon's, the expression of love mingling with the taste of salt on her tongue. What feels like a lifetime passes before Soleil's phone chimes. The Uber is here.
They load the car in silence, and even Fish is beginning to realize the gravity of the situation at hand. Soleil knows that one last glance back will drive her to tell the young man in the front seat to stop and let her out, so she drops her gaze to her phone.
Soleil Whitaker 06/27/17 On any given normal morning after, Soleil would pad into the bathroom to check her neck and chest for hickies. She would then march back into the bedroom, and proceed to wake her wife with a pillow to the face.
But, this morning is not normal. No, this morning is one Soleil has been dreading since she received an urgent email from Elouise Orlav. Soleil has a flight to catch. Her bag had been packed the night prior, dog crate been prepped, and both have been set out by the front door. And yet, she still drags her feet through her morning routine.
An overwhelming amount of pain and miserable longing sits heavy in her chest as she makes a final sweep of her belongings. Passport, wallet, phone & laptop, duffel, Fish. All she’ll be missing is the love of her life.
“I’ll miss you riotously,” she states, fingers entangling themselves in Rhiannon’s thick hair. She hopes Rhiannon knows this already, but she figures there’s no harm in reminding her. “You’ll be on my mind constantly. You’ll be my first and last and only thought. I promise."
Soleil Whitaker 06/27/17 Soleil’s emotions change as quickly and as frequently as the weather, and she’s aware that it can be rather irritating to the average person. So, she is forever grateful that despite how very little command she has over her own emotions, Rhiannon has shown nothing but patience and devotion. All she can do is allow for her feet to carry them over to the bed.
She’s whispering ‘I love you’ over and over again, as if to make up for all the days she’ll miss saying it in person. And then she’s laying her wife down against the pillows, lips hovering just far enough away from Rhiannon’s own.
The words are off her tongue before she can even think to stop them. She apologizes with her head hung, as the heat of shame rises in her cheeks. She’s being a brat, she knows that full well. But, the thought of being apart is getting the best of her. Swiping at her cheeks with the back of her hand, Soleil takes a deep breath.
“I trust you,” she says, hands lifting to cup Rhiannon’s cheeks, “And I trust Elouise. I just, I don’t want to be without you. I can barely handle when you leave for work.”
Soleil realizes, then, how pathetic and childlike she sounds, and her demeanor shifts. Suddenly, her hands are on the backs of Rhiannon’s thighs, pulling upwards to lift the angel. “Can I have tonight with you?” she asks once Rhiannon’s legs are locked around her waist, “I don’t know how long I’ll be gone, so I just… I want to love on you."
Soleil Whitaker 06/26/17 Soleil can’t stop the silent tears; no amount of willpower would be sufficient enough to do so, after all. She clings to Rhiannon as they make their way up to the bedroom, and she wishes - oh, how she wishes - she could bottle the sensation of being close to her wife. She’s fighting to stay present in this moment, but it already feels like she’s thousands of miles away.
“I don’t… I can’t go, Rhiannon,” she says, shutting the bedroom door quietly behind her. She stops to lean her head back against the wood, eyes sliding shut as if to stop more tears from falling. Her hand lifts to clutch at the locket around her neck.
Perhaps to her own detriment, Soleil is loyal. And right now, she’s being tested. She’s being pulled and torn in all different directions, but at the end of the day, she is faithful to the woman who owns her heart and soul. Although she knows little of why she’s being recalled to the Order’s headquarters, Soleil is already overwhelmed with all the possibilities.
Soleil Whitaker 06/26/17 Soleil’s arms immediately lift to wrap themselves around Rhiannon’s slim waist. She’s already booked an early morning flight, and it won’t take her very long to throw some clothes into a duffel. For now, her focus is on making the most of her time with Rhiannon.
Twenty-four hours is a short period of time, especially considering the given situation. Since getting married, the Whitaker women have spent no more than mere hours apart. Now, there’s the chance they’ll go weeks without physical contact. And Soleil’s heart aches at the thought.
There are no words. At least, none Soleil can deem as appropriate for the moment. Instead, she settles into her wife’s arms, forehead dropping to Rhiannon’s shoulder. She takes the time to revel in the warmth and security she finds there, trying (and failing, miserably) not to think of how riotously she’s going to miss it while away.
Soleil Whitaker 06/26/17 Soleil cringes at how Russian vodka sears the back of her throat. She coughs once, and shakes her head. “Liquid lunch,” she responds before offering the second shot to her wife, “You might want it.”
The Order is recalling its members back to the capital, and Soleil knows that there’s a storm brewing. Jameson Orlav has been absent for the past few weeks, and Soleil’s instinct tells her that it hasn’t been the kind of absence due to work and business. Nevertheless, she doesn’t pry when speaking with Elouise. She’d much prefer for the tall blonde to volunteer information, as unlikely as that wish may be.
She’s uncapping the bottle of Stolichnaya once again even before Rhiannon can respond. Soleil isn’t quite sure how she’s going to break the news that she needs to return to Moscow; she knows how her wife feels about her affiliation with the Order, and hyperaware of how wary she is of her friendship with Elouise. But, during her meeting with Colin, her phone had chimed, denoting that she had an unread email marked ‘urgent’ sitting in her Inbox.
I only agreed to meet with Colin because he knows a lot about audio programs in New York. He's doing me yet another solid.
Colin's an old friend, one of the few I had while living here. He knows the higher-ups at the Center for Innovation.
Do your coworkers not get suspicious of how often you go to the bathroom? And aren't you ever concerned that they might walk in if you stay in your office?
I missed you today. I'm sorry I had to run out as soon as I woke up, was running late for a meeting.
I wanna get close to you, feel all of you under my hands. I just... I love you so much, I want you to feel it.
Soleil Whitaker 06/23/17 I'm always missing you. But, it was really nice to just lay in your arms, you know?
Soleil Whitaker 06/23/17 Babe. Margot isn't dead. I'm just not sure if she's here or at her new apartment.
I mean, I don't know how else to prove to you that I only want you, forever. No one makes me feel the way you do.
I'm not worried, babe. I just hate when men think they're entitled to a pretty woman. Like, f*ck off.
The look on his face when I told him you're my wife was priceless. Nothing better than crushing a male ego..
Now, let's go. This restaurant has three Michelin stars, so It took hella long to get a reservation.
Soleil Whitaker 06/20/17 Oh, good. You're starting to accept that I have the natural tendency to bite.
You can't fight Susanne because she's the woman who decides. We need to maintain a healthy, working relationship with her if we want Wilson to come home.
We're all gonna be great together. Think of how well he got along with Fish and Luna. How natural he looked here.
This is wonderful. I didn't think it could get much better, but just thinking of having Wilson home with us is...
I can't even begin to describe how good it's going to feel. Even if the fridge is stocked with juice and finger foods.
If we were on a sinking ship, and someone yelled, "grab two things you love!" I guarantee the first thing you'd go for is my boobs.
To wake up next to you every morning is the greatest honor I could ever possibly fathom. You're the love of my life, you're the reason I'm here. You're the best to and for me, and I will never have the words to sufficiently express what you mean to me.
Soleil Whitaker 06/18/17 I'm gonna take a bite, regardless of what you order. Marriage is just glorified food sharing.
Whatcha feeling for dinner? I'm torn between pasta and that swordfish that looked good the last time we went.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life. Can you blame me for wanting to show you off?
Let's go on that walk. Then we can come home, and I can stare at you for a little while longer. Okay?
I know you've taken charge of the laundry, but I also know that grass stains are a b*tch to deal with.
There was like, maybe a week between Wendy's and Nick's. You were pretty forward when we left the bar.
You're right, babe. You two had real feelings for eachother. It's rude of me to trivialize and diminish that fact.
