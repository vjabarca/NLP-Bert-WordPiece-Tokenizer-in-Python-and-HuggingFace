Of the scores of Wear OS by Google (also called Wear OS, and formerly Android Wear) smartwatches that function nearly the same, the Fossil Q Explorist and Fossil Q Venture are the ones we recommend for most people. Similar models that differ mainly in size and design, these two Fossil watches offer style and band options for the widest range of tastes while performing as well as (or better than) anything else out there. They handle notifications and your responses without delay, provide all-day battery life, swiftly handle voice transcription and Google Assistant questions, and provide casual fitness tracking. Their buttons and screens are responsive. They look and feel like good watches, too, which is something we think most people want from a smartwatch at this point.
Huawei’s Watch 2 looks like a logical follow-up to the original Huawei Watch, a former pick in this guide. It adds built-in GPS capability, plus NFC for mobile payments, and it ships with Android Wear 2.0. The problem is that the Huawei Watch 2’s bezel does not rotate, and it has no rotating crown to take advantage of Android Wear 2.0’s scrolling interfaces. That wouldn’t be so bad if the thick, notched bezel weren’t significantly raised around the screen, making it more difficult than it should be to swipe between screens, scroll through apps, or perform pinpoint taps near the edge of the screen. Beyond that, the watch is thick (12.6 millimeters, or 2.6 mm more than the ZenWatch 3, though that’s still slightly thinner than the original Huawei Watch), and it seems slower to respond to input and to launch apps than other modern Wear OS watches. It doesn’t seem worth its price for most people.
If you’d prefer your smartwatch looked more like a piece of jewelry than a small computer on your wrist, you’ll like Skagen’s Falster range. The straps of these slimline watches come in a few different leather or stainless steel options but coupled with the included minimalist watch face designs, they all look sleek and stylish in a way few other smartwatches manage.
Basically, smartwatches are wearable-technology devices that maintain a relatively persistent wireless connection to your mobile device—usually a smart phone—and can receive notifications of incoming calls, texts, instant messages, social-network updates, and more, from that device. Some can also let you accept and conduct phone calls right on the watch. And even newer models (the Samsung Gear S, for one) can act as smart phones all on their own, without needing a paired phone nearby.
Our 19 contenders all promised to give us some distance from our phones by notifying us of incoming calls and texts. But we found that some smart watches were much slower than others at letting us know we had a call. It turns out the quality of the bluetooth connection determines how quickly you’ll be notified, with our worst performers only registering the call with two seconds to spare before diverting to voicemail (yes you, Montblanc) while others simply failed to display any calls at all.

I visited the Fitbit app more than I usually do during the first day of wearing the Charge 3 so I could manage notifications. This device is the first tracker to go beyond the basic call, text, and calendar alerts that most Fitbit trackers can receive. The Charge 3 can alert you to any and all happenings on your smartphone if you want. In the notification panel in the Fitbit app, you can choose which apps you want to receive alerts from—turn on all of them so you never miss a beat, or only turn on the apps that are most important to you.
As of 4 September 2013, three new smartwatches have been launched: the Samsung Galaxy Gear, Sony SmartWatch 2,[62] and the Qualcomm Toq.[63] PHTL, a company based in Dallas, Texas, completed is crowd-funding process on Kickstarter for its HOT Watch smartwatch in September 2013. This device enables users to leave their handsets in their pockets, since it has a speaker for phone calls in both quiet and noisy environments.[64] In a September 2013 interview, Pebble founder Eric Migicovsky stated that his company was not interested in any acquisition offers,[65] but revealed in a November 2013 interview, that his company has sold 190,000 smartwatches, the majority of which were sold after its Kickstarter campaign closed.[60]
Inside the Charge 3 are an accelerometer, gyroscope, optical heart rate monitor, and an SpO2 sensor for tracking blood oxygen levels. The Charge 3 is the third Fitbit device to include an SpO2 sensor, following in the footsteps of both the Fitbit Ionic and the Versa smartwatches. However, currently the SpO2 monitor lies dormant inside all of these devices as Fitbit hasn't made use of it yet.
Apple has announced the Apple Watch Series 4. It’s the first real redesign of the wearable since Apple introduced it in 2014, but the changes aren’t so drastic that you won’t recognize it as an Apple Watch. The Series 4 comes with an upgraded display, and you can choose either a 40mm or 44mm model. Even though the screens on the new models are bigger, the overall body of the Watch is roughly the same as previous models, so you shouldn’t notice much of a difference on your wrist.
The Samsung Gear S3 was our prior pick for Samsung phone owners because of its smooth dial rotation and interface. But it was notably large, with a 46 mm face, and the Frontier model was half an inch thick, notably bulky even for a smartwatch. The Gear Sport, our runner-up pick, is less bulky, less expensive, less overtly masculine-styled, and provides most of the same features, minus the LTE option.
I’ve had the Samsung Gear S3 classic for a few months now. There are lots of apps now available including a music app which allows you to save and play as many tracks as the sizeable built in memory will allow you to save to the watch. The in-built speaker is high quality for making and receiving calls and of course listening to music, but a Bluetooth headset makes all the difference.
The Huawei Watch 2 comes into its own if you’re looking for a smartwatch that can double as a sports watch, thanks to built-in GPS and a heart rate monitor on its rear. Use the 4GB of built-in storage to save your Google Play Music playlists offline and you can pair Bluetooth headphones for a phone-free experience. The Huawei Watch 2 will work with Huawei’s own suite of fitness apps, Google Fit, or other third-party apps such as Strava, offering excellent choice.
Using your voice with the Google Assistant function built into the Q watches (and every modern Wear OS watch) is generally okay, though only roughly 80 percent reliable. The combination of a microphone on the side of your watch, a Bluetooth connection to your phone when you’re away from Wi-Fi, your phone’s cellular Web connection, and the imperfect acknowledgement of human speech by Google Assistant do not make for anything near a 100 percent success rate. When it works, Google Assistant makes you feel connected and advanced; when it fails, you can be seen as a person who asks their wrist about the capital of Malaysia. This is more a reflection of the state of connectivity and digital assistants than of the Q watches themselves—or any Wear OS watch, for that matter—although in our experience Wear OS watches fail on voice queries more often than Siri on the Apple Watch. That said, voice dictation on the Q watches is far more reliable, at least when it comes to recognizing words and phrases, than Google Assistant. If transcription fails, it’s more likely to be because of the watch/phone connection than the watch mishearing your words.
(What you think of the Q watches’ design depends on which model you buy, and in which configuration. We tested a Q Explorist in its smoked stainless steel look and a Q Venture in rose gold with leather. But if you don’t like size of these two models or the available styles, you can buy one of more than 300 planned smartwatches from 14 of Fossil’s fashion brands and get the same technology inside, just with different cases, straps, and buttons. There are Kate Spade smartwatches, $200,000 Tag Heuer smartwatches, and many more from Diesel, Skagen, Armani Exchange, and the like, all offered under Fossil Group’s umbrella. You can probably find a smartwatch with a case, band, and look that looks like something you want to wear on your wrist every day, rather than settling for close enough. Fossil’s Q watches, though, hit a good balance of sensible and stylish, with a reasonable price to match.)
The problem is that to monitor your sleeping patterns, a valuable feature most of these new smartwatches support, the watch needs to be on your wrist. So leaving your watch charging overnight while you slumber isn’t going to work. But smartwatches have small batteries compared to smartphones, so should only take 2 - 4 hours to fully charge, depending on the model.
In addition, the TicWatch Pro has an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance, along with its own heart rate monitor and GPS hardware. It has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 2100 processor inside, along with 512MB of RAM and 4GB of onboard storage. It’s available now in either black or silver colors on Amazon for $249, but at the moment it’s exclusive for members of Amazon Prime until August 15. You can read a lot more about the TicWatch Pro in our extensive review.
The first digital watch, which debuted in 1972, was the Pulsar manufactured by Hamilton Watch Company. "Pulsar" became a brand name which would later be acquired by Seiko in 1978. In 1982, a Pulsar watch (NL C01) was released which could store 24 digits, making it most likely the first watch with user-programmable memory, or "memorybank" watch.[9] With the introduction of personal computers in the 1980s, Seiko began to develop computers in the form of watches. The Data 2000 watch (1983) came with an external keyboard for data-entry. Data was synced from the keyboard to the watch via electro-magnetic coupling (wireless docking). The name comes from its ability to store 2000 characters. The D409 was the first Seiko model with on-board data entry (via a miniature keyboard) and featured a dot matrix display.[10] Its memory was tiny, at only 112 digits.[9] It was released in 1984, in gold, silver and black.[11] These models were followed by many others by Seiko during the 1980s, most notably the "RC Series": During the 1980s, Casio began to market a successful line of "computer watches", in addition to its calculator watches. Most notable was the Casio data bank series. Novelty "game watches", such as the Nelsonic game watches, were also produced by Casio and other companies.[citation needed]
Flaws but not dealbreakers: Wear OS, Google’s name for Android for smartwatches, still feels like a work in progress, and in our testing, the Google Assistant voice feature frequently dropped responses—though that could improve via software updates. The Q line’s button at the 3 o’clock position is easy to accidentally trigger, bringing up Google Assistant and sometimes sending it nonsense questions. Wear OS also lacks a left-handed mode to allow you to switch the watch around. On the workout front, Fossil Q watches lack a heart rate monitor, so they’re not able to detect workouts or help with pacing; and the size of these models—and most Android smartwatches, really—and the touchscreen interface make workouts more difficult to monitor and pause than with a dedicated fitness tracker.
This watch won’t work unless you have an iPhone. However, it is hands-down the best smart watch for an iPhone. Other watches (including the Fossil Q Venture) will work with an iPhone, but won’t be able to answer calls or respond to texts, and if you want to customize the apps on your watch, you’ll need to navigate the Google Play store through the watch screen.
The Charge 3 works continuously throughout the day to track steps, distance, calories, floors climbed, and heart rate—the standard array of activity data. Fitbit has been tracking these metrics for so long, without making many significant updates as of late, that they are business as usual on the Charge 3. I appreciated that most of the watch faces available for the Charge 3 show your real-time heart rate, either in a corner or at the bottom of the rectangular display. I like being able to glance down and know my pulse.
The Asus ZenWatch 3 was a previous top pick for a Wear OS smartwatch. As of now, it has reached the end of its Wear OS updates (after a very long delay getting to Android Wear 2.0). Its rotating crown does not actually work to turn or scroll anything on the screen. Its proprietary watch band connections mean that your options are limited to what is available from third parties on Amazon. And the watch is hard to find new.
For instance, I rarely use the touchscreen on my Fitbit Versa because the shortcuts to my most-used smartwatch features are available via the three physical buttons on the watch. Gesture recognition is hit and miss on smartphone screens, nowhere near as responsive and accurate as on your smartphone screen, so bear that in mind too. Force Touch is a useful feature that has come to smartwatches, notably the Apple Watch. Just press down or tap the screen to activate different features.
In order to find the best smart watch, we looked at text and call features and, of course, design. We dug into tech reviews to separate must-haves from perks. Then, we brought in 19 smart watches to test for call responsiveness, text-ability, app accessibility, and general ease of us. In the end, three watches stood out for their reliable connectivity, gorgeous interfaces, and easy navigation.
The watch also has a new 1.2-inch 390×390 display which is a full circle and OLED this time around, providing punchier colors compared to the previous WSD-F20. It also still packs the dual-display technology with a special mode that turns off Wear OS and can provide up to 4 weeks of battery life. Standard usage will last around 1-1.5 days of use on a charge while a new “Extend” mode provides up to 3 days while using offline maps and GPS. Pricing lands at $549 and the watch will be available in January.
If you want the app, notification, and style advantages of an Apple Watch but need better fitness tracking, you can upgrade to the Apple Watch Series 3 and get built-in GPS, as well as waterproofing that allows swim tracking. But the Series 3 costs more than a fitness tracker or even many running watches, and it still has compromises compared with a dedicated fitness tracker, such as a lack of dedicated physical buttons. We think serious athletes are better served by a fitness-specific device.
Apple Watch Series 3: If you are an iPhone user and generally exist in Apple’s ecosystem, it makes sense to get an Apple Watch. The design quality is exceptional and the Watch makes a nice pairing with your iPhone as materials and design elements are common to both. Apple’s Health app covers most of the bases when it comes to tracking your essential fitness and activity indicators - nutrition, sleep, physical exercise, but Apple has gone further with HealthKit, which allows health and fitness apps downloaded from the App Store to share data with each other. Apple has committed to Watch, and its attention to practical and eye-pleasing design as well as useful tracking features is commendable. ($529)
Samsung released its Galaxy Watch, a follow-up to the Gear S3, a prior pick. The Galaxy Watch is available in 42 mm and 46 mm configurations, with either a Bluetooth-only connection or Bluetooth plus LTE from T-Mobile (at launch). The biggest update seems to be the battery life, which the company claims will last for days between charges. The Bluetooth version of the Galaxy Watch is available for $330 for the smaller version and $350 for the larger (46 mm) model; the 42 mm LTE version is available for $380 and the 46 mm is $400.
Our top pick for most people is the Apple Watch Series 4 with GPS (starting at $399), which has a huge display, ultra-fast processor, Raise to Speak Siri, fall detection and a built-in electrical heart rate sensor for taking on-the-go electrocardiograms. It also runs watchOS 5, which makes the watch even more useful with automatic workout-tracking, offline podcast playback and a Walkie-Talkie voice chat feature.
Samsung's Galaxy Watch, a Tizen OS watch (starting at $329), is our favorite smartwatch for Android users. In addition to up to four days of battery life and a great design, the Galaxy Watch offers built-in GPS, heart rate sensor, water-resistance, Samsung Pay support, plus a nifty rotating bezel for navigating the interface. You can also download music from Spotify to the watch for offline listening. However, you get far fewer apps than you would with a Wear OS watch.

This is, so far, the most credible news I have read regarding the 44 SAF soldiers killed in Maguindanao.
From the start, I was surprised why P-Noy was pictured in the news as somewhat like, his hands are tied up and he cannot clearly answer questions from the media. Now it turns out, if the MST (Manila Standard Today) reports are to be used as the basis, that it is P-Noy who is equally to blame for the carnage of 44 SAF soldiers in Maguindanao because he allowed Alan Purisima, the PNP General suspended by the Ombudsman for 6 months, to operate incognito, meaning, outside the normal chain of command, and that, Purisima is reporting directly to P-Noy or to Malacanang Secretary Paquito Ochoa. General Leonardo Espina, the interim PNP Head and DILG Secretary Mar Roxas were kept in the dark of the whole operation where Purisima was given all the needed support, military personnel, guns, ammunition, and everything "under the sun" with the mission to capture two "high prized" terrorists, 1 - with a $5M reward and the other - a $1M reward. They were all enticed into the big reward money that they kept the operation "a top secret" for themselves - for P-Noy and Purisima. Now that the secret operation turned afoul, P-Noy cautioned the people "to be calm." What in the hell does he mean by that? P-Noy has to be answerable for the lives of 44 SAF soldiers!
Footnote: This comment came out in connection with a news report written by Federico D. Pascual of Philstar, entitled, "SAF operation run by P-Noy himself?" A summary of the whole operation was like this: 392 - total number of men involved; 12 - wounded (seriously); 44 - dead. It came out on 01/28/15.

There are numerous options for assistant senior care currently available, ranging from home care and independent living to full nursing homes. Choosing the type of senior care that’s right for your loved one is a challenging task, and much research needs to be undertaken to find the type of care that would best suit their needs. When looking for the right type of care, keep the wishes of your loved ones at the forefront, but also keep in mind their health needs, personal preferences, as well as likes and dislikes. Knowing the difference between different types of senior care will help you make the right decision.
Nursing Homes are otherwise known as Long-Term Care or Skilled Nursing Facilities or Homes for the Aged. Nursing homes are for elderly individuals who require assistance and care 24/7. Seniors with debilitating medical problems or cognitive impairments, who require professional assistance, opt for this type of care option. The distinguishing feature of nursing homes is that they provide professional medical assistance, convenience of access to physical therapists, many kinds of healthcare practitioners, as well as nutritional meals and personal care amenities.
Assisted living combines independent living with assistance from professionals when necessary. Support services are available when needed.
In these types of communities, seniors receive help with certain daily activities, such personal care, medication reminders, or other activities, all dependent on individual needs.
Here, seniors’ living space usually has his/her own furnishings and decorations; staff are required to be accommodating to the privacy and independence of each resident.
Thus, the main difference between nursing homes and assisted living communities is that the former offer professional and on-going medical services, while in the latter, assistance is offered largely with regular daily activities.
Assisted living residences and communities can look like single-family dwellings or apartment buildings including common visiting and dining areas. The atmosphere of the suites and studios in an assisted living community are usually home-like including kitchenettes offering the resident the choice to dine alone or in a community dining room.
Seniors that have experienced a decline in health and require assistance with one or more daily life activities may be perfectly suited to an assisted living environment. Many Assisted Living arrangements and communities allow the individual to age in place rather than relocate to a facility that provides additional levels of care and the way to find out whether the residence of your loved one qualifies for the option to age in place is to contact the division of government, usually the Ministry of Health, in your province.
Nursing Homes employ health care professionals that are available to their residents as needed and they also offer most of the same options that an assisted living community offers. For example, social get togethers and excursions, physical therapy and exercise classes. The bottom line is to assess the needs of your loved one and match them to the type of care and the options provided at each level.
Most of the rooms in assisted living housing look very much like bedrooms and some even have apartments. These assisted living apartments are rarely shared unless clients make a special request for it. The environment provides independence for clients and they get to live and look after the house the way it used to be in their formal home. There is a kitchenette attached to the house to allow people to prepare their meals. An advantage of living in an assisted home is that people will be able to socialize. In most homes for the elderly, they are usually indoors all alone in their rooms talking to no one. However, with assisted living centers, they are able to mix up and socialize with all other people in the assisted living community. There is a greater rate of interest provided all around that will help them to live longer and in good health.
The assisted living houses have facilities for people going out together and having social occasions. The people are allowed to invite their families to come for the outings and social gatherings because there is fun and the people are allowed to contribute towards the program. Most public holidays are usually celebrated with loved ones around them. There is arrangement for outings for everybody to go out for shopping and sightseeing to places of interests. This is surely more than anyone can ask for. It is like living normal lives amongst the people they love.
When the residents ones relocate to assisted living homes, there are usually concerns about their independence. Many of them want to be alone, without any one disturbing their lives. There is independence in the assisted living home for anyone that will not want to socialize or join in group activities and social gatherings. Since there is provision for a personal apartment or room, some may even have a kitchenette where they can cook their own meals and other amenities made available for them, they can stay anyway when they want. Everyone is giving equal chances of participating in all the activities but they are left to make the choice of whether they want to participate or not. Participating in activities is good for their health and will help them to live longer. Isolation is not good for anyone at all; it can lead to a faster decline in health for aging senior citizens than anything else. Talking and participating in social activities will make them come alive each and everyday and boost their health. This is better than staying alone and relying on people to take care of them.
The assisted living house not only provides independence for the people living there, they also make sure that they keep a close watch on the people. Most families always worry about the people there being able to take care of themselves. There is no need for such worries as the staffs in the home are often seen around watching people, to make sure that they are doing well without disturbing their peace at anytime. People that are isolating themselves are seriously taken care of and information is passed to their family members to always come to visit them. By the time family members come visiting from time to time, it will ease their burdens and they can be happy to associate with anyone around again. Family members can also encourage them to participate in any social events or outings organized by the community from time to time.
The families of the people staying in assisted living home are at peace knowing that their elderly loved ones are being taken care of appropriately and that they are safe from any harm. The benefits of taking aged loved ones to assisted living homes are far beyond measure. It is different from any other home whatsoever. The care they provide is excellent. They watch over the residents to make sure they are doing fine and organize social activities for them to enjoy. They are not left behind during the holiday season when people are going around enjoying themselves. They get to go out too and partake of the holiday fun. The freedom provided in assisted living communities is awesome. Everybody can live the same way they are used to in their houses with no one bothering them.
People who are having elderly ones at home can take them to assisted living homes instead of nursing homes. An Assisted living home is like a home away from home. There is not much difference between home and assisting living home. People can arrange their things the way they were arranged in their original homes. They can even eat their normal meals. They don’t have to worry about preparing their own meals but can still have it the way they want.
When faced with the responsibility of choosing and selecting senior care options, many families have preconceived ideas about what assisted living facilities represent for their loved one's future. Common myths are perpetuated by the media, which tends to emphasize the negative stories experienced by a relatively small number of seniors. The following information will dispel those myths and provide helpful insight about the benefits of ALFs.
In fact, ALFs are a relatively new concept designed to serve the needs of a changing society, in which seniors live longer than ever before and prefer to live as independently as possible. Throughout the United States, adult children commonly juggle two-career households, raising children and attempting to meet the needs of their aging parents. Within the last twenty years, professionals in the field of eldercare have recognized the need to promote an active lifestyle within an environment where care is also provided. As a result, seniors no longer feel they are burdening their families with their needs, live independently in their own apartment, enjoy a full calendar of activities and feel secure in knowing assistance is always available. Whereas nursing homes focus primarily on skilled medical care and therapies, assisted living facilities promote as much independence in activities of daily living as possible.
Medicare does not provide coverage for non-skilled care services such as assistance with activities of daily living, including bathing, dressing, medication management, toileting and transferring. While skilled nursing facilities accept Medicare, ALFs typically accept only private pay or long-term care insurance. In some instances, assisted living facilities will license a limited number of apartments for Medicaid recipients and others may offer programs to assist residents whose income falls below a particular median range. However, those with limited finances and who anticipate applying for Medicaid in the near future may want to consider alternative care options such as care homes.
I work with elderly people in an assisted living facility. Each time I see a particular resident, the experience is new. I try to comprehend how it must feel to age, to change and become more and more dependent. The result is, I'm dumbfounded... I just don't understand.
I talk with residents who tell me about their former careers, amazing vacations they've been on, achievements throughout life, etc. They even relate to where I am at in my life right now. "When my first son was born, I was so terrified, yet excited," one resident recalled. "He wouldn't sleep until I bounced him so long I developed a constant twitch." That's right, I would think... That's what I have to do. Then ten minutes later, the resident would ask me how my baby was and recap her experience, "When my first son was born, I was so terrified, yet excited." My heart sinks each time. Will that be me when I get "OLD?"
I, personally, am humbled everyday by the elderly people of this community. They each have their own struggles and issues, but they are alive and continue to thrive. I just hope younger generations appreciate where they are at in life and realize that one day they, too, will be "OLD." No matter what body part fails or how bad the memory declines, it's attitude and relationships that are the difference and make life worth the struggle!
Assisted Living and Nursing Homes are two terms often used interchangeably, however this is a mistake. The two are actually very different, and a candidate for one is not a candidate for the other. The following are some differences between the two:
o	Individuals in assisted living are more independent and can usually get through most of the day by themselves. They only need general help with daily activities like bathing, dressing, grooming and preparing food.
o	Candidates still enjoy social activities with other people and make autonomous decisions about their day. Someone who belongs in an assisted living facility would be downright miserable in a nursing home.
o	Nursing homes also provide rehabilitation to help people gain back their independence after a serious health problem, i.e. a stroke or fall.
o	Similar to hospitals, nursing home patients have little to no privacy and quite often share rooms.
o	Nursing home clients are viewed as patients, not clients. They are there for the sole purpose to get well. If you or your parent is well, a nursing home would not be the ideal place. Perhaps you should investigate an assisted living facility near you.

What do you do after a busy day? Do you crack down on whatever that needs to be done first then relax or vice versa? Or is it all sort of mixed up, a little?
Personally, I'm an "eventually" kind of person. I finish my homework the day before it's due or on the day it's due. So when I get home at like four o'clock, I just like to chill out and relax. Lay on my bed and visit the internet. Or listen to music. Or sleep. Or bug my cat.
Geeta Subramanium is a historian by training deeply interested in ancient Indian temple architecture and architecture of the western world. She truly believes that architecture reveals the quintessence of civilizations. It is the truest record of life as it was and is lived.
During the course of her study she was introduced to the ancient Indian science of Vastu, an invaluable treasure given to us by our venerable sages.
Vastu aims at providing positive cosmic energies in human habitations. It creates a synergy between human beings and the pranic energy of the universe. A positive relationship is established between the microcosm represented by humans and the macrocosm represented by the universe.
Vastu has the ability to change a human’s cosmic path and guide him or her to stability and success.
Geeta Subramanium is today a renowned Vastu consultant and considers herself privileged to have advised several people about Vastu problems in their homes and place of work and to have brought happiness and prosperity into their lives.
Her website www.thevastupractice.com gives an insight into the depth of her knowledge. Do click on this website to read about Vastu in detail and to get valuable Vastu tips.
Geeta has translated “Panchaamrita” a book written by her mentor Shri Manoj Juyal, from Hindi and Sanskrit to English.
Her other interests include food, art, travel and gardening. Apart from Vastu, cooking is her other passion because she believes that food is a profound means of communication between family and friends and plays a vital role in preserving human relationships.
She has started a project to catalogue traditional recipes from all over India that are in danger of being forgotten.
She recently published an e-book on 15 traditional mango recipes called “Mango Recipes” that has been very well received.

Interior design consultants can visualize the overall project and illustrate the effects before they are actually executed. This is the primary reason why designers can save you time and money.
Using a Design Firm that is also a furniture retailer/wholesaler gives you the bennefit of having a non-commissioned designer. You will pay less in the long run. Because you won't be paying retail prices and commission on top of that.

The other night, I was trying to change the time of an appointment on my Google Calendar, and instead of changing it, I deleted the event. Whoops!
It turns out there are two ways to recover from this. (Three if you count just entering the whole thing again.) First, if you’re quick enough you can click on the Undo link at the top of the Calendar. But if enough time goes by that link fades away.
On the left side of the Calendar window, highlight the calendar where you want to restore your event.
When you’ve restored everything you need to, click on the Back to calendar link, and you’ll see your event again. Whew.
I received an enthusiastic recommendation for a program called Battery Care from long-time reader Steve.
This is a nifty little utility that monitors a battery’s health and allows you to improve the battery’s performance. You can download either an installer or a portable version from this page.
There’s an excellent, clearly written, informative discussion of the Memory Effect in modern batteries here, including answers to the question “Should I remove the battery when A/C is plugged in?”
Both the site and the download come back clean in VirusTotal, and the portable version, which is what I tested, was free of malicious software and bloatware.
Sometimes when I’m working at the computer (or, OK, sometimes when I’m reading Facebook posts at the computer…) I wonder what day it is. Looking in the Taskbar’s right-hand corner shows me what time it is and it shows me the date. But is today Tuesday or Wednesday?
The easiest way to find that answer is to hover the cursor over the date. When you do that, you’ll see the “Long date” format, including the day of the week. However, if you want to show the day of the week without hovering, do this:
Change the Short date format (That’s what’s displayed as the clock in the Taskbar). The key under Long date shows the meaning of the letters, and the Example section above all that shows how it looks.
For example, if you want to see Day of Week, Name of Month, Date you would enter dddd, MMMM d. You can append the year by adding yy to see 17 or yyyy to see 2017.
If you want to see the day and date displayed exactly the way it is in the Long date format, just copy and paste what’s in that box to the Short date box. Be sure to click on Apply in the lower right corner to save your changes.

After missing an additional a few gaming game titles brought on by lower-leg along with fashionable trauma, Chargers controlling coming back Melvin Gordon return to utilize along with Sunday. Gordon is actually a number of grass scared associated with acquiring his / her main 1, 000-yard your organization 12 months, even though when the Chargers likelihood getting involved in all of them along with Sunday’s 12 months closing in the Kansas Area Chiefs?
What 12 months meant for Gordon. To become a admirer just who assisted all of them the moment many others too early called all of them some kind of split via, My personal company is actually fairly delighted. Apart from carried out this particular 2015 first-round choose leap coming back in a terrible beginner period, even though he or she developed in to some kind of game-changing risk taker. Lastly,Junior Seau Jerseys which labor force offers turned out to be Gordon’s labor force, along with that’s exactly why is his / her sophomore period and thus exceptional.
After credit score rating practically nothing touchdowns not long ago, this particular 23-year-old offers preserved 12 whole touchdowns (10 your organization and a few receiving) concerning that the actual champion, that is connected meant for sixth-best in the NATIONWIDE SOCCER CATEGORY. He’s averaged the persuasive 3. 9 grass every consider generating one of many most difficult annoying facial lines in the class. Gordon appeared to be inside the edge associated with requesting 1, 000 your organization grass, even though he or she experienced the ill-fated injury along with Complete 7 days 14’s burning up in the direction of Carolina Panthers, which frequently cost all of them which choice.Melvin Gordon Jerseys
And by way of ill-fated Establishing them shouldn’t consist of happened. Quarterback Philip Rivers appeared to be strip-sacked starting in the exercise, along with Gordon attempted recover this particular fumble, which frequently produced injury.
Thankfully, MRI results shipped undesirable, even though truth be told there wasn’t numerous good perspective meant for coming back. Right after not able to utilize, Gordon experienced skipped Complete 7 days 15’s exercise in the Oakland Raiders along with Complete 7 days 16’s exercise in the Cleveland Browns.
But in the following paragraphs i’m when using the leftover complete 7 days about the 12 months about the plan, along with Gordon is generally coming back inside the procedure topic. He or she certainly wants in order to reconcile inside the topic along with sign up for his / her teammates, even though when the Chargers likelihood them? They’ve been and thus disappointing getting trauma, just in case Gordon acquires hurt once again, the actual organization will get crucified.
The Chargers will most likely ignore this particular playoffs using the lastly instantly period, and thus Sunday’s exercise is generally ineffective. Even though I’m in a position to guarantee individuals which Gordon wants to get at which objective. He’ll want to determine his / her period utilizing a helpful discover, which indicates getting his / her main vocation 1000-yard your organization season–and AFTER I option his / her teammates desire which meant for all of them, way too.Joey Bosa Jerseys
The guarded proceed is to stay all of them, along with AFTER I accompany which an excellent range. Gordon do miracles and thus difficult in the offseason to exhibit his / her exercise throughout, along with he or she have to be privileged. Possibly it’ll not at all show substantially that will help you enthusiasts, even though achieving which motorola landmark may show something much more meant for all of them.
If Gordon is generally loose to assist participate in along with Weekend break, AFTER I declare this particular engine coachs make it easy for all of them complete the actual task. Once again, he’s a number of grass scared, and thus ideally it is going to you have to consider some kind of consider or possibly a few to assist mix which pull.Keenan Allen Jerseys Right after he or she might, provide them with this particular footballing using the trophy occasion along with near all of them reduce using the the remainder about the exercise.
After each one of the problem he or she already been provided not long ago, Gordon must obtain which.

Whether you are going by Eurorail or Interrail some good things to know. Filmed in Hannover and Frankfurt, Germany Copyright Mark Wolters 2013
I was hesitant to upload this video due to looking like another stupid American, but I decided to upload it anyways --- this is what I feel holds a lot of Americans back. We travel a lot by car, carpool, Buses, but then rarely do we travel by train unless there are those that live in a big city. Even when I lived in Dallas, the complexity was not as difficult as those in the European countries. So this video is both for comedic relief, as well as to help those who do want to travel across Europe. The start of the video is in Prague, when I thought I was so overwhelmed by the 'VAST train station' ---- yet then was headed to the largest and most complex train station in Europe......Berlin. Steps to not screwing up backpacking through Europe: 1- buy ticket, reserve seat & make sure you are there at least 30 minutes early so you don't miss your train. Especially if you are traveling across countries. 2- Get on the right train, via the right platform, and make sure that the car you enter is the exact car you need to take (apparently the cars separate at different stops and you don't want to be left behind unknowingly) --- IF YOU DON'T KNOW, ASK!!!! Ask after you get on the train if you must, they will close the doors when the conductor blows the whistle. 3- Once seated, look at your ticket......look at the next platform you need to go to and when your train arrives and when the next departs. You will need to know this because you may need to run across the station to platform 12b from platform 1a in 15 minutes......and there is always the slow person.... 4- Keep your ticket in hand! You need it to scan in and scan out of each of the train stations. The ticket must be current, or you can get a fine. If you have a Eurail Pass, you can just scan the code on the outside of the ticket to get through the gates. The Eurail tickets sometimes have their own gates, so try to go with the gate not everyone is going through (if you can't understand the Language). 5- Make sure you are getting on the right type of train. If you get on the wrong train you can still get fined. It may be going to the right place, but if you get on the faster train or get on an inter-city train instead, you can get fined. Just hold your ticket up and flash it in people's faces (NOT FORCEFULLY) just a gentle suggestion as 'if anyone is looking at this, maybe they will tell me it's the wrong ticket, lol' 6- Bring your own water, your phone charger, and a travel pillow --- especially if you have a sleeper train -- small backpacks are the best.....just minimize by packing like the news told you the city was going to be bombed and you had 15 minutes before you had to be evacuated. That will get you everything you need in one bag. Yes you will probably smell......bring Febreeze.....trust me.....there are people who smell worse on the trains.

http://www.distantlands.com To Purchase Eurail Passes http://distantlands.com/travel-agency/ How do you plan a European train trip? This video will help the 1st time European Train traveler understand the different passes of Eurail, when is it beneficial to buy point to point tickets and how to a workable travel itinerary. What is the difference between a global pass, a select pass and a one country pass. #DISTANTLANDS #TRAVELTIPS #TRAVEL
Despite the Senate's recent failure to pass the initial Republican repeal-and-replace, the Trump administration is undermining both Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act in other ways. That threatens all of us. It undermines the common good. And it defies both global moral consensus and the promises made in America's Declaration of Independence. Let's look at moral arguments in support of universal health care (that is, some version of "Medicare for everybody").
Our Founding Fathers talked about three inalienable rights: to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness (commonly understood at the time as personal fulfillment or human thriving). A right to life without a right to health care seems hollow.
The world community seems to agree. In 1946, when the world order had come to the brink of collapse threatening the liberty, health, and lives of entire populations, the United Nations established the World Health Organization, arguing for “. . . the highest attainable standard of health as a fundamental right of every human being.” Health as a human right (a right by virtue of simply being human) has been reaffirmed in Article 25 of the United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), and subsequent human rights documents.
For rugged individualists and others who do not believe in the language of human rights, there are other compelling moral arguments. It’s hard to dismiss research demonstrating that other industrialized countries with universal health care cover everyone, spend less, get better outcomes, and have greater satisfaction rates than the US. In other words, these systems are driven by prudence, pragmatic outcomes and fiscal stewardship.
When we tolerate a society that does not ensure access to health care, we engender not only poorer health status, but also loss of human potential and more problems— including social instability and violence, substance abuse, bankruptcies and unemployment. Indeed, a committee of the National Academy of Medicine estimated that the “benefits in terms of the value of healthy life years gained by providing coverage to those currently uninsured are likely greater than the incremental societal costs of the additional health care services that they would receive if insured.
Most countries figured this out years ago. They treat health care as part of the social contract based upon the common good . Healthcare is an essential service in which all of society has a stake, just like clean drinking water, emergency services, public education, safe roads and bridges. Health care is fundamental to safety, preservation of life, human thriving and equality of opportunity. The international community, speaking through the Constitution of the World Health Organization, has unequivocally said that “governments have a responsibility for the health of their peoples which can be fulfilled only by the provision of adequate health and social measures.” The U.S. is now the ONLY industrialized country without universal health care.
Indeed, sixty percent of Americans agree that health care is an appropriate responsibility of government. Even those who disagreed still overwhelmingly favored keeping Medicare and Medicaid—which are, of course, government insurance programs.
And finally, religious mandates provide another source of moral guidance. Essentially every religious tradition tells us to care for the sick. Each has a version of the Golden Rule, i.e., to treat others as we would want to be treated. These obligations to one another are not meant to be empty words, optional only when convenient. They are serious moral obligations we owe to each other.
In short, the moral arguments in favor of universal health care are robust and plentiful. How about those against? I am at a loss to come up with a single moral argument against it, or conversely in favor of health care as a privilege. Can you?

The US Supreme Court has ruled that a California law requiring crisis pregnancy centres to post notices about nearby abortion services violates the rights of free speech enshrined in the constitution. Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York praised the ruling as “an important victory for the free speech rights of pro-life organisations”. He said it allowed pro-life centres to continue providing support “without being forced by governments to provide free advertising for the violent act of abortion”. The court found that the law changed the content of clinics’ speech “by compelling petitioners to speak a particular message”, and that it went further than being a mere “regulation of professional conduct that incidentally burdens speech”.
Mexico’s bishops have congratulated leftist leader Andrés Manuel López Obrador on his landslide presidential election victory. The new president, known as Amlo, has promised to tackle corruption and crime. During the election campaign 100 candidates and their staff were killed. Amlo is a former altar server who describes himself as a “Christian in the broadest sense”. In a statement, the bishops said a better future was only possible if every citizen worked towards it. “No ruler by himself has all the ideas and all the solutions,” they said. As the votes were being counted, Amlo said: “The changes will be profound.”

Shortly after the construction of the Gotthard tunnel, Switzerland pulled off another pioneering achievement: the construction of the Thusis - St. Moritz railway line between 1899 and 1903. This opened the Upper Engadine to tourists. The Rhaetian Railway still passes over the same bridges and through the same loop tunnels. A still greater challenge was the subsequent construction of the Bernina Railway. No other railway in the world overcomes such steep gradients and winds through such steep curves without the help of a cogwheel.

We've been traveling around Europe with our Standard Poodle, James. Most of the trains in Europe are dog friendly. In fact, we haven't found a train that wasn't dog friendly yet. I explain this in the video - but when you are researching train tickets online, you can't seem to buy them once you add a "dog" or "hund" to your search terms. We couldn't figure this out so we went and asked at the OBB train ticket office in Vienna. When you travel with your dog, you have to buy the tickets in person at the train station. I go into the office knowing exactly what date and time and train number I want and then I buy two tickets and one dog ticket. So far, only one train has been sold out where there wasn't an option for a dog ticket. And that was a night train from Vienna to Venice. When traveling on a night train with your dog, you have to book a private sleeper cabin. But on most other trains you just buy your tickets that day or a few days in advance and pick an open seat. There is usually an option to reserve a seat for a little extra but you don't usually need that unless you are traveling on a busy date (holidays, some Fridays or Sundays). And some trains do require you to reserve a seat - usually the high speed trains. The local regional trains are even easier for traveling with your dog. Those tickets can be bought at a kiosk at the train station on the day you travel. Keep in mind most local and regional train tickets are open-ended (they aren't for a set time and sometimes not even a set date) so you MUST validate the ticket using the machines on the platform. Otherwise you could get in trouble when the conductor checks your tickets - if your ticket isn't validated, it is as if you don't have a ticket at all. We also travel with a muzzle for James. Some conductors will ask you to put your muzzle on your dog. It depends on the country. Almost everywhere in Austria required a muzzle and one train in Italy asked for us to put J's muzzle on him. You also need to have an EU pet passport for your dog. We haven't been asked for this yet on a train (we also haven't been asked for our passports on a train) but you do need to be prepared and have it if asked. Music: Clover 3 by Vibe Mountain

Travelling by train is an unforgettable part of your trip and something you shouldn’t miss out on.

Scenic views of ripe vineyards and flowing rivers are yours for the taking here! Hop across the border and you’re in Swiss Alps territory, travelling the iconic Konstanz to Tirano route. Next up, it’s Tirano, in northern Italy, down to Ventimiglia – via fashion capital Milan, of course. Then, a coast-hugging train ride through the South of France, to Nice – just the ticket for views of traditional French villages, winding all the way down to Marseille. And, for the final leg of the trip, it’s another border crossing into Spain. From Barcelona to Madrid there’s a real change in landscape – we’re talking mountains, plains and even deserts.

The full version is below: Faster than fairies, faster than witches, Bridges and houses, hedges and ditches; And charging along like troops in a battle, All through the meadows the horses and cattle: All of the sights of the hill and the plain Fly as thick as driving rain; And ever again, in the wink of an eye, Painted stations whistle by. Here is a child who clambers and scrambles, All by himself and gathering brambles; Here is a tramp who stands and gazes; And there is the green for stringing the daisies! Here is a cart run away in the road Lumping along with man and load; And here is a mill and there is a river: Each a glimpse and gone forever!
Hi, this is my report about my trip with the Tranitalia Frecciarossa 1000 from Rome Termini to Milano Centrale in Executive Class. The ETR1000 is a high-speed train in Italy and the Executive Class is comparable to a First or Business Class product in a plane - very luxurious seats, perfect service, lounge access and many other things, that make traveling comfortable. To be honest, I haven't seen that level of perfection in any other European high-speed train before, so yes, this is my new favourite. This is my very first train travel report. So if you have any suggestions for future videos, let me know in the comments! As always I want to point out that I'm no professional video editor whatsoever.

Traveling by train enhances your entire European experience: from genuine interactions with locals to relaxing journeys and no wasted time at airports. With quiet gazing through panoramic windows as you're whisked from city center to city center. With gourmet dining and no hassles. The train brings out our best. It's relaxing. It's serene. It's intimate. It opens us to everything the journey has to offer; the simple pleasures of personally connecting with other people and cultures. We also believe part of that serenity comes from knowing the train is a low-impact form of travel that preserves the authenticity of the regions and natural beauty we pass through. In fact, high-speed trains are three times as energy efficient as regional trains, but even the slowest train is 25% more energy efficient than cars. Is it any wonder trains are so popular? For access to the most choices and best rates, make sure you book in advance. Because a little bit of planning can mean a lot more traveling. With over 50 different railway systems, it's much easier for the North American traveler to ride the rails than plan their own trip on them. That's why we're here. Rail Europe offers a unified booking experience across Europe, with the ability to package products from different carriers. And we have special relationships with carriers that started over 75 years ago. These relationships have led to special agreements benefiting our clients, including technology that enables us to offer and sell more rail travel options than any other provider. It's simple. With Rail Europe you don't have to sort out the details, we already have. Visit us at at http://www.raileurope.com.

The resource manager prevents the cache from consuming too much memory by evicting old data. If the garbage collector is unable to keep up, the resource manager refuses additions to the cache until the collector has freed an adequate amount of memory.
You can use the resource manager in any Pivotal GemFire member, but you may not want to use it everywhere. For some members it might be better to occasionally restart after a hang or OME crash than to evict data and/or refuse distributed caching activities. Also, members that do not risk running past their memory limits would not benefit from the overhead required to run the resource manager. Cache servers are often configured to use the manager because they generally host more data and have more data activity than other members, requiring greater responsiveness in data cleanup and collection.
The resource manager has two threshold settings, each expressed as a percentage of the total tenured heap. Both are disabled by default.
Eviction Threshold. Above this, the manager orders evictions for all regions with eviction-attributes set to lru-heap-percentage. This prompts dedicated background evictions, independent of any application threads and it also tells all application threads adding data to the regions to evict at least as much data as they add. The JVM garbage collector removes the evicted data, reducing heap use. The evictions continue until the manager determines that heap use is again below the eviction threshold.
Critical Threshold. Above this, all activity that might add data to the cache is refused. This threshold is set above the eviction threshold and is intended to allow the eviction and GC work to catch up. This JVM, all other JVMs in the distributed system, and all clients to the system receive LowMemoryException for operations that would add to this critical member's heap consumption. Activities that fetch or reduce data are allowed. For a list of refused operations, see the Javadocs for the ResourceManager method setCriticalHeapPercentage.
Note: Avoid passing the critical threshold. It might be better than a hang or an OME, but the GemFire member that becomes a critical member is a read-only member that refuses cache updates for all of its regions, including incoming distributed updates.
From all regions in the local cache that are configured for heap LRU eviction, the background eviction manager creates a randomized list containing one entry for each partitioned region bucket (primary or secondary) and one entry for each non-partitioned region. So each partitioned region bucket is treated the same as a single, non-partitioned region.
The background eviction manager starts four evictor threads for each processor on the local machine. The manager passes each thread its share of the bucket/region list. The manager divides the bucket/region list as evenly as possible by count, and not by memory consumption.
Each thread iterates round-robin over its bucket/region list, evicting one LRU entry per bucket/region until the resource manager sends a signal to stop evicting.

TechServ, a new citywide and soon-to-be statewide program, tackles the STEM and IT divide in urban centers by training "opportunity youth" to work at partner organizations in local communities.
Crazier are the Republicans, Independents, and Conservatives that continue to watch the behavior of the Liberals and treat them as though they are humans with simply “different thoughts” or “different ideas”.
Liberals or Progressives belong to or support groups such as La Raza, BLM, Hamas, and the Screen Actors Guild.
Black Lives Matter wants all White people dead and Hollywood not only wants Trump drawn and quartered but they now want his son to be raped.
They’ve moved from Bernie Sanders telling women that they all fantasize about being raped, simultaneously, by three different men, to a Fonda, fantasizing about child molestation.
Citizens living under that debacle are subject to “communal” decisions and are no longer referred to as Germans, French, or Italians but rather “Europeans”.
From the top of Canada, to the bottom of Mexico, tractor-trailers have been rolling for decades unfettered allowing the transport and trafficking of humans, drugs, and weapons.
Islam preaches death to America from Quebec to Mexico City while the Pope, living behind walls and protected by arms, calls for the United States Citizen to have neither.
Tens of millions collect checks for doing nothing while tens of millions work 40, 50, and 60 hour weeks feeling the brunt of taxation without the benefit of representation.
American children die everyday in “progressive” cities across America while Liberals like Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Paul Ryan, and a traitorous media encourage and allow the trafficking, rape, and murder of Honduran, Guatemalan, and Mexican children daily as well, in order to boost their profits and vote totals, current and future.
Many in the “law enforcement” wing of the Executive Branch are willfully ignoring the Chief Executive while others are trying to remove him from office.
The Judicial Branch has overtaken the country and allows for different “interpretations” of the Constitution and Law depending upon the geographical location of the Citizenry.
Yes, the Inspector General has detailed that a coup was attempted and many of those who attempted the coup are now running the Mueller “Investigation” and yes it appears that no one in the Obama Administration ever bothered to follow any rules or regulations, let alone laws.
Yes, Jeff Sessions is undoubtedly part of the “Swamp” and is doing his best to protect politicians at the highest levels in both parties.
My father is the quintessential example of continuing to move forward while expecting a successful outcome regardless of the task or the travails.
Maybe it’s that the economy is picking up, the markets are continuing to climb, and the Right To Try was put to work by President Trump.
Maybe it’s the feeling that citizens of the freest country in the history of the planet, are as prepared as they are going to be, and are ready to do what needs to be done.
November will be here shortly and either the House will stay with Trump, minus parasites like Paul Ryan, or it will go to the La Raza-Farrakhan-Hamas-Pelosi Party that will more than likely try to Impeach the President.
Rejoice in the fact, that if the bell is rung tomorrow, or tonight, we will indeed move into the fight.
Relish that it is. That you will have an opportunity to stand as an Individual while serving something much greater than ourselves.
We leave the hate, the snark, and the Oppression behind. Find not a minute not a second for those who will not grow, will not awaken, will not evolve.
On top of the announcement that Social Security and Medicare are both basically bust (insert “Shock and Awe” here) the #MeToo movement decided Gavin Newsom and his drug and alcohol induced dalliances with someone else’s wife (just not his own) was fine with them.
Antonio Villaraigosa or Tony Villar, or whatever his name is this week conceded his Gubernatorial run in California and endorsed Newsom after commiserating on their cheating pasts.
Now that’s “leadership” as he proclaimed to deliver, one half dozen times, in thirty threadbare seconds.
Speaking of traitors, Bill Clinton reared his hollow head, yelled “MeToo”, and ended up doing an apology tour that found him on Stephen ColBert and Ernie while Hillary rolled her eyes, threw her hands in the air and yelled “Stupid White Men! Don’t they know what they cost me!”
Speaking of stupid white men, formerly fired FBI dilettante Andrew McCabe is now clamoring for immunity while the Inspector General’s office leaked information that James Comey may have been “insubordinate”.
The FBI appears to be filled with bonafide morons as one agent was filmed dancing and doing a flip with his weapon.
In reference to bonafide morons, progressives are bragging that California is the fifth largest economy in the world never mind almost half of the people living in the Bay Area reportedly cannot wait to leave.
Then again the State of Jerry Flush when Brown voters have to brag about something as they make their fecal and urine maps “resisting” Hepatitis A.
In reference to feces and urine the aforementioned James Comey and his sour stomach were both back in the news.
The “fixer” for the Clintons, Bushes, and Obamas better find his hole card and put his back up against a thick tree.
Just come clean already Jimmy. Admit the truth about Benghazi, Fast and Furious, Lois Lerner, Hillary’s emails, the Clinton Foundation payoffs, Obama’s flexibility with Putin, hidden bank transfers to Iran, and Seth Rich…just to name a few of the things that happened under Obama’s “scandal free” administration.
The economy is moving, the wall is being built (slowly), Kim and Kanye had their photo ops, heck The Donald even got John Box of Rocks Cox into California’s General Election (and yes I will vote for him).
As Meryl Streep’s stand-in Silly Sally Field once said, “We don’t like you Jimmy, we really really don’t like you.”
The American actress known as Roseanne was quite active on Twitter this week. The target of one particular tweet called it a “teaching moment”.
Of course she isn’t the primordial ooze known as Samantha Bee (insert wiping fecal matter off of shoe joke here) but “Rosie” has been liberal over the years and as we’ve witnessed for a while, Liberals will eventually eat their own.
She is a Trump supporter and you cannot be that and stay on the island of misery known as Progressivism.
Of course the Liberals were swarming like a cloud of locust, frothing and licking their dog-like chops.
I’m sure they ranted, frothed, and typed from their safe spaces at Starbucks, where they shared a water and their hatred of cops, while waiting for the most important meeting of their lives, and took turns blocking the entrance to the unisex bathroom to all white men, with exceptions for Harvey Weinstein, Carlos Danger, Bill and Hillary Clinton.
One can only imagine they snickered and gossiped about Sarah Jessica Parker and Julia Roberts having “horse faces”, that Dr. Phil resembles a “Walrus”, Donald Trump looks like an “Orangutan” and Buddha’s fat belly because making fun of Muhammed would anger Keith Ellison or Maxine “Sharia” Waters.
Let’s give all the “Mean Girls” a quick break from their “nasty” Madonna thoughts about “blowing up the White House” and explain what Roseanne and her Ambien were both trying to say.
The Muslim Brotherhood is funded by Islamic groups and nations including Iran. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and “vj” supported them in Egypt before they were removed and many reportedly executed.
Obama and “vj” also met with representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood IN THE WHITE HOUSE while he was President.
Furthermore the money that Barack Obama sent to Iran made its way to Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Brotherhood.
Those groups used and are using that money to kill Americans and America’s allies, never mind that they hate women.
Why is it okay for Gary Busey to “look like” a baboon but not okay for Valerie Jarrett to “look like” an ape?
I can see it now. The collective Starbuckian stare moves from one pantsuit to the other. After a communal sip of shared water, a free for all flip of their hair, and a few mouth puckered selfies, the socialized group all answered in one Stepford Wives like drone.
Those that needed the lesson were too busy Keeping up with the Kardashians to learn the age old adage that while all Democrats may not be horse thieves, all horse thieves are definitely Democrats.
Over the years I’ve written columns centered around, or about, Memorial Day. As with many concepts in today’s world too many have no understanding of the things they think or say. It seems to be the overwhelming habit of tens of millions in America to repeat the last statement that they’ve read or heard as though it is fact.
Furthermore these brave souls that gave the “last full measure of devotion” didn’t do it in protection of Democracy.
We know this because we don’t have Democratic Rights, Socialist Rights or even Representative Rights.
For almost 250 years the American citizen has pushed, persevered, and perished all in service to the greatest country in the history of man.
Appreciate that your abilities are able to grow in a free society because of the ultimate sacrifice of others.
Those heroes came in all shapes and sizes, all colors and creeds and through it all covered each other until their last breath.
We honor them with solace, with silence, with tears and even with smiles as we are here breathing, because of them.
Thank you to those who never came home. Thank you to those who ran into the fight knowing it would be their last race.
In general the “media” or media types like to refer to a “blue wave”. I think they are spelling it incorrectly.
Nevertheless there is a belief that a blue wave is fast approaching, ready to crash onto the shores of America, and drown every Republican politician in its way.
The cherry on top of this proverbial progressive fecal gathering is the Impeachment of Donald Trump.
Never mind these United States are not a Democracy they still don’t understand what Impeachment actually entails.
Due to this I believe many have been asking the wrong question and that question is can a house divided (The United States) long stand?
Speaking of Stupid Humans Seattle has now imposed a levy on “wealthy” corporations, and will tax companies that make over a certain amount of money, PER EMPLOYEE.
Rob companies of the money they’ve earned while sending out the message to America’s homeless that Seattle is the place to be!
This money will be used to build “affordable housing” for the homeless. In other words they are going to tax, AGAIN, the companies who are employing the most people, and then use this money to “house” the others.
The only thing appropriate about this tax is they are aiming at Amazon and Jeff Bezos who is a card carrying Liberal.
Not that Bezos will care. He’ll just slash prices on something else, driving out all competition, until he can raise them to anything he likes.
Looks like Seattle politicians think they are smarter than them both although it’s doubtful they even know of ol John D.
In the history of the world, Liberalism or Progressivism, or whatever title one uses today for Oppression, will eventually be flushed into the annals of time.
Speaking of nasty a twenty-five year old man was arrested in Texas because he pretended to be seventeen while joining a high school basketball team and being named offensive player of the year.
Offensive sounds about right but come on man! Twenty-five years old playing against kids? You should have been named player of the decade!
As a child raised in the Seventies any time I struggled with an issue my mother always told me “you can do it Duffy Moon”. With today being Mother’s Day I thought it appropriate to mention this and recognize the strength of the American Mother.
So with much love I say Happy Mother’s Day to my mom and all the wonderful American Mothers from sea to shining sea.
As Primary selections happen across the United States most citizens, rightly so, are paying attention to the politics in their area. Many times politics are indeed “local”.
I’d suggest today’s politicians are “loco” but then I’d be accused of cultural misappropriation or fat shaming.
Still “loco” means crazy in Spanish and boy oh boy do we have LOCO figured out here in CaliforNIA. Last Tuesday a televised Gubernatorial debate took place. Here’s where my writing skills could take over in my explanation of the sewage that was indeed found and spewed on that stage and into our homes that fateful night.
The “fact of the matter” as one shell of a human during the debate, said at least one half dozen times, in a 45 second window is this. If you are still willing to vote for a Democrat, any Democrat, it is a MATTER OF FACT that your behavior has caused the deaths of thousands of Americans at the hands of illegals including but sadly not limited to one Kate Steinle.
It appears the Democratic voter will literally have to feel the bullet go through their own backs while walking with their loved ones before they see the light. Of course that light will be too late for them, as it was for her. Then again I stand corrected. For a Democrat to be shot in the back they’d have to have a spine so I guess they are safe to continue to dodge feces, urine, and hypodermic needles in the Bay Area (home of Gavin Newsom) and Los Angeles (home of Antonio Villaraigosa).
To all Californians: If you would like to continue with oppressive taxation, worst roads in the nation, crumbling waterways, horrendous schools, the largest unfunded pension system in the country, this side of Social Security, and reward a man who cheated on his spouse with his best friend’s wife then by all means vote Gavin Newsom.
Again to all Californians: If you would like to continue with the aforementioned list AND support “returning” California to Mexico by the way of La Raza then by all means vote Antonio Villaraigosa.
No lobotomy offered as it would be cost prohibitive to your only alternative. If California does indeed continue down the path of “The Race” your only thought will be how tight Americans can get hemp around your neck.
To all Americans who are legal residents and registered to vote in California: There are two Republicans on the ballot.
I cannot stand the Republican Party either but at least they know (minus the Bush family and all Bush supporters i.e. Liberals) what form of government each and every State must practice in America.
Of course it is a Republic or a Republican form of government (Article 4 Section 4) and no Democracy is NOT a Republican form of government.
I am not going to “kill” Cox in this column. If for some reason, after the Primary, he is the only Republican in one of the top two spots then he will have my vote.
Liberal women in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Berkeley, and Hollywood are calling for a new path away from the lecherous hands of the Liberal men.
The only thing stopping you is your quest for insanity otherwise known as doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different Weinstein, Weiner, or Clinton.
Recently I came across the word Pansexual in a Yahoo title. I’d read it before but didn’t realize it wasn’t a joke. As I clicked onto the article my first thoughts about Pan were frying or Peter but after reading a portion of the article apparently it is now “okay” to have sex with one, the other, or both.
It appears he meant well but the man famous or infamous for the line “now I ain’t saying she a gold digger but she aint messing with no broke niggaz” should keep his off the cuff remarks to himself.
In his defense (slightly) he was correct in the statement that slavery was and is a choice. Many humans with black skin during that time period refused to be subjugated and either fought for their Freedom or to their demise.
In fact it is the very choice that was made in the later 1700’s in places like Concord, Lexington, and Bunker Hill.
As West was being piled on by Liberals the all too familiar lie that, “African-Americans have been enslaved for over 400 hundred years in the United States” was perpetrated in the media again.
Assuming that we ignore the skin color bigotry used in referring to humans as African-American AND put away our Common Core “statistics” and actually use MATH, that would put us back in the 1600’s where the United States didn’t exist, but both Islam and England did, so let’s get some perspective.
If Black Lives Matter wants reparations then take it up with the King (now Queen) and Mohammed and be done with it already.
That should cover almost 200 of the 400 hundred years, and even with that, they’ll have to get in line behind the Irish.
Beaten, chained, raped, enslaved, and bred like animals, they continued to trudge forward and free themselves.
Generation after generation of Irish eventually became AMERICANS in the New World and continued to carve out a little better path for their children and their children’s children until the 1860’s arrived where many of them lined up with the Union and DIED so that humans with black skin would be free.
Just in case the BLMers or Liberals aren’t keeping up let me put it into words they will understand.
In the history of the world, no such event (one skin color of human fighting the same skin color of human to defend a different skin color of human), had or has ever since been recorded, but it wasn’t the color of the white mens skin that made this special.
Although dramatically smaller in numbers there were also black men who fought and died for the Union in the War Between the States. The color of their skin wasn’t what made them special either.
That nation, after the War was concluded, would again be known as the United States and ALL of those men would forever be known as AMERICANS.
Still, after it was all said and done the opportunity to return to “Afrika” was made available to all humans with black skin. The country of Liberia was recognized after the War and any and all “Afrikans” were able to relocate and leave the United States.
This means the ancestors of every human in these United States with black skin CHOSE with their own FREE WILL to stay in America, just like every citizen of any color, CHOOSES to stay here now.
We have freedom of thought, freedom of speech, and freedom of movement in this country. If one truly hates these United States then move along. As we’ve seen recently with the “refugees” Mexico is quite easy to stroll through.
Aside from the Human Trafficking that happens everyday, through our still open border, all other humans in America are here not only because our ancestors decided to stay, but because we decide to stay as well.
Then again if skin color is your primary issue in life, Liberia is always available. Be very careful. Liberia makes Chicago, Detroit, and Baltimore look like a Starbucks.
If my days here on Earth were to end tomorrow I would be at peace with my life. The very specific individual goals that I wanted to attain have been met. The rearview mirror holds nothing for me as I jumped into every situation with everything I had. Some were “successful” in the ways that we measure success. Some were not but every experience brought new information to me, which coupled with my naturally curious mind, allowed me to gather knowledge.
I finally understood Free Will as a gift, that Love has nothing to do with sex, and that nothing was more important than Freedom.
My three rules in life didn’t change. Work hard, save my money, and be beneficial to others was and is still the way I live.
The one thing that did change was my patience with humans who through every fault of their own behavior were and are attempting to subjugate other humans.
We hear and read about murders, rape, and corruption all the time but I am not referring to this. I am referring to the humans in our everyday lives who continue to support the attack on these United States.
Recently, a post written by a self-proclaimed Democrat, crossed my path. The individual was explaining in depth why the Democratic Party was dead, how they’d lost their vote, and what they would need to do to get it back.
This post had been shared by another “disappointed” Democrat who’d added a line that stated “I don’t agree with everything written but….”.
It’s pretty clear they don’t and even clearer that those who continue to march to the drum of the letter D are too stupid to bother with anymore.
Talking to Democrats is akin to talking to Tiger Woods about fidelity, Oprah Winfrey about caloric restriction, or Barack Obama about the truth.
Still, I’ve noticed the keyboard warriors have backed off some of the blather and are now trying to “reach out” or say things like “we need to learn how to talk to each other”.
Let’s be clear Democrats. You need to keep your mouths shut and “hope” when this mess is finally dealt with that we “change” our minds about hanging each and every one of you.
You actually voted (twice) for a man who promised “flexibility” to Vladimir Putin and helicopter dropped billions of dollars to Iran, who calls us the Great Satan, in the middle of the night. This same man is friends with a Sunni Muslim who called for the killing of all white people and Jews…in the United States.
Louis Farrakhan is a bigoted piece of trash that needs to either be executed for Treason or deported to Liberia BUT at least he says exactly what he thinks. I have zero respect for him but that zero is more respect than I have for the cowardly Liberals who now just want to “get along”.
You voted for a woman who championed another woman who believed that blacks and poor people should never procreate.
You voted for humans who think it is okay to cut babies into pieces, yank them from a woman’s stomach and then sell them.
You support molesters in Hollywood, politicians who run guns in California, and Sharia as “compatible” with the United States Constitution.
If this was 1776 you’d be Tories. If this was the 1940’s you’d be Nazis. If this was the 50’s 60’s and 70’s you’d be Communists.
It’s the only way they won’t continue to be cut down to build more “affordable housing” for foreign nationals.
Kind of like “is” to Bill Clinton, “oral sex IS not sex” or “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”
In today’s world he would be correct, and charged with grooming and molesting a young female half his age, from the ultimate position of authority.
Speaking of the Devil(s) Barack Obama’s brother-in-arms Louis Farrakhan called for the killing of all white people a couple of years ago. Not to be outdone he also called recently for the killing of all Jews.
This seems pretty clear to me but millions of humans practicing Judaism in America voted for Obama so maybe “Never Again” means something different than NEVER AGAIN.
Continuing on in the “interesting” category James Comey has been making the rounds attempting to sell a book and possibly become the spokesman for yet another Me Generation medication.
It seems his former occupation caused him to be nauseous and queasy. Coupled with the fact that every time he speaks anal leakage occurs, I’m sure we will see him soon on an infomercial near you.
Speaking of the wall Jerry Brown is blaming “low-life politicians” for causing problems in California. He should know as he is King of the Low-Lifes.
Find a mirror Jerry or better yet a toilet and as you told all of out here a few summers ago “flush when Brown”.
Mark Zuckerberg had to spend a few days in front of Congress. I’m not a fan of Zuckerberg constantly changing Facebook’s algorithms but unlike most of the talking heads in Congress, he’s no idiot.
I strongly suggest you become inclined Mark as the Liberal RINO Progressive agenda is going to try and tear your company apart. No amount of cash (bribes) or apologies will suffice. They see these things as weakness. You aren’t weak but there is a significant difference between coding and physical altercation. Give me a call. My friends and I can offer you plenty of hands on training that will bolster your back and strengthen your soul.
We will do this for free, as unlike your algorithms, we believe in giving without monetary expectation.
While this was taking place two guys in their sweatpants were hanging out in a Starbucks waiting for a meeting that would “change their lives”. Apparently they were told repeatedly to buy something or leave. They declined on both. The police were then called and told them multiple times to leave. They declined again and were taken out in handcuffs for trespassing.
Why can’t Starbucks provide a free place for these hard working upstanding “entrepreneurs” to not only camp but live permanently.
In fact Starbucks should stop charging period. They should now provide free wifi and safe spaces to anyone who wants these things.
I think Lou is fantastic but I am beyond that question now. I want to know when Sessions is going to be indicted for Obstruction of Justice or at least impeached.
Congress has the authority to remove him and for the record the House should impeach the entire Obama, Bush, and Clinton administrations.
Once this is complete the Senate should convict them all making them unable to hold Federal office in the future.
Then again most of these Individuals are guilty of crimes against these United States and those crimes are punishable by more than Impeachment and Conviction.
When asked why, he answered, “So I can help people.” During a period of political and social unrest in the U.S., tender-hearted Falcon travels through youth into adulthood crossing the paths of love, corruption, and power, in search of the American dream—freedom. Despite incredible odds, he never gives up, never gives in, and never loses sight of who he is.
His quests carry him to the wilderness of the Idaho mountains, into the belly of a foul profiteering county jail, clamped in the jaws of an unethical corporation, and ultimately to a long-desired romance. As a successful businessman, and with an incredible woman at his side, Falcon turns his passion toward fixing the corruption of his beloved America and runs for president. His message is clear: United, we can make a difference.

The Minnesota Vikings released their first unofficial depth chart on Monday, giving insight to questions — for the time being — about the status of a few training camp position Teddy Bridgewater Jerseys battles. The headliner is obviously Cook, a rookie who was drafted in the second round. He's drawn rave reviews in camp, and Anthony Barr Jerseys is already ahead of incumbent starter McKinnon. The Vikings activated Latavius Murray off the PUP list Monday, potentially complicating things. He hasn't practiced at camp yet, and was at his best on the goal-line last season. There's a good chance that Cook keeps this spot once the real games begin. No surprises here. The Vikings' offense used a fullback on 20 percent of their plays last season, and there's only one of them on the roster. Ham was Adrian Peterson Jerseys known for his pass protection at Division II Augustana, another point in his favor. If he can chip in on special teams, there's probably a place for him on the roster. Is Floyd's suspension holding him back, or has Treadwell surpassed him? We'll see, but camp-watchers are bullish on Treadwell, who was on the field for just 80 plays last season. The other news item out of camp Monday was that Reiff is finally healthy after missing 10 days of camp with a back injury. Hill also went down Saturday night with an apparent injury and was replaced by Jeremiah Sirles. His agent clarified on Twitter that Hill wasn't seriously hurt. Sirles is emerging into a versatile backup Brett Favre Jerseys lineman, an important role that Joe Berger filled from 2011-14 before taking over the Stefon Diggs Jerseys full-time starting center spot in 2015.

Was given a Pelican 1170 for helping a buddy of mine move, and used it for my AR-15 for a couple of years.
Originally I had an Eotech and a standard foregrip, but I picked up an ACOG and also a grip Pod and Surefire mount, so my foam was now essentially useless. I finally got off my lazy ass and ordered a foam kit off Amazon for 50 bux. Now my case looks and feels like it belongs.
I just keep all my rifles in a safe. Foam is good for transportation, but I hope you don't actually store it in there, since foam soaks up the oil. Unless you got something fancy I'm not aware of.
It helps me stabilize better since my hand guard has stuff mounted to tit and the edges feel like crap if you squeeze hard. And mine is a Grip Pod, so I have the added bonus of hitting a button and having a functional Bipod, which is great for long/prone shooting.
All I know is it shoots shit-ass Brown Bear Boat-Tail 62 grain rounds all day long and in 1,000+ rounds I haven't had a misfire or a misfeed. I this thing.
Shotty is My Remy 870 with an Eotech 552 on top, Magpul forward and Magul stock. Simple, but shoots well.
It just seems that the totally vertical angle is gonna bend the wrist the wrong way and affect shooting

It is time for another chapter of "The Together Teacher" in our book study. Today it is time for chapter 12 which is all about dealing with your paper and stuff. Our hostess this week is Amy of The Core of Grade Four!
I have LOVED the accountability of blogging as I am re-reading this book because I have actually had to implement the strategies - not just read the book! I am really starting to feel like a more Together Teacher! Last week we had a professional development session and the facilitator asked us to plan our small group writing lessons for the next week. One of the teachers across from me said, "As if we all have our class lists and their writing levels with us?" I was able to say, "Actually I do!" I pulled out my flexi and there under my school binder was everything I needed. I DID let her know that it was all because of this book study. Last year I would have been in the same boat as her!
So let's dive into this last chapter, and be sure to read on down to the bottom because we have a great giveaway for you!
Many of us already carry a teacher clipboard, but Maia points out the problem with it is that we carry EVERYTHING with us on the clipboard. From late slips to lesson plans, it often becomes a jumble of mess and you can't find what you need easily. She gives some suggestions about what should be on there and how it should be arranged. She suggests using your Together Teacher System for maintaining your time, your to-dos, your thoughts, and your notes. Your clipboard should hold your lesson plans, behavior/homework trackers, and mastery trackers. If your Together Teacher System is easy to hold, you could also keep these things there as well.
As a teacher you NEED a handy place to capture and record valuable data about your students to inform you instruction and planning. When Maia was teaching, she says that she would make a chart each week with the students' names on the vertical axis and the learning objectives for the week across the horizontal axis. During each part of her lesson - (warm-up, guided practice, or independent work) she would circulate around the room noting who had mastered or showed partial mastery of the objective. She would also make notes of students who were struggling to remind herself to return to the students for extra help later during the day or week.
Just like academic data, you may want to keep track of behavior as well. Who is participating and who is not? Are certain students having difficulty staying on task during a certain subject?
You can't keep this data if you don't have a pen or pencil to write it down! I have been so guilty of racing around my classroom in search of a writing tool. Maia suggests keeping it with you at all times whether in your pocket, attached to your lanyard, or clipped onto a clipboard.
Maia suggests keeping a place in your Together Teacher system to hold the papers that come your way when you are out and about. Just make sure you go through that in-box as part of your daily routine.
It seems like taking work home is just part of the teaching territory. Maia suggests using a five or seven pocket accordion file that matches your in-box file on your desk. I use my 31 bag with dividers in it as well.
Although this is the last chapter, there are a ton of other resources including books, blogs, apps, and more. Maia has included a CD for you to access the items she refers to in the book for creating your own Together Teacher system.
This month I also have donations from the hostesses of this book study as well! And... I am also throwing in an item of your choice from my store, along with a copy of The Together Teacher!

Thanks for hosting this giveaway! My biggest organizational challenge is probably setting time aside to get things organized. I feel like I need a whole day to do it, and can't just do a little here and there. Definitely a challenge :)
My biggest organizational challenge is leaving my plan book at home or at school when I need it in the other place! I'm slowly moving over to digital but until then... :)
Thanks for this giveaway- the book sounds very helpful. My biggest challenge is finding places to put everything, especially papers.
I struggle with organizing the layout of my room. I've changed it a bunch of times already and I've only been teaching for three years!
My biggest organizational challenge is keeping my desk tidy enough during the day...we don't have a break till the very last period, so things stack up till then and drive me crazy!
My biggest challenge is remembering where I put things after I get organized! It seemed logically to put things in certain places but somehow I forget.
I HATE to file! My biggest challenge is putting this BACK after I have used them! I need a secreatary! HAHA Great BOOK! I WOULD LOVE IT! Wendy 1stgradefireworks@gmail.com 1stgradefireworks
Thanks for the informative post, suggestions, and giveaway. Papers, papers, papers and space to file it all! Love that students are starting to do more and more on laptops. Have a teacher pen necklace that is AWESOME!
Papers and where to store them. Have to save lots now with new guidelines in place. Thank you for the giveaway.
What a great giveaway:) So excited to follow you and your other friends in this giveaway! My biggest challenge is where to put everything and where to store them.. my apartment and classroom are very very small! Thanks for the chance!
This is great. My worksheets that I've used are the biggest things I have difficulty keeping organized.
I accidentally clicked that I follow Southern Love of Teaching...but I cannot figure out how to follow. Any suggestions?
Thanks for the great giveaway!!!! My biggest struggle is finding time to put things away when I am done with them. Things seem to pile up way to fast in corners and on flat surface, lol.
Thank you for this great giveaway! My biggest challenge is keeping my desk tidy. I always manage to dump all the stuff I'm using during the day on it! :S
Thank you for this Giveaway. I work with so many grade levels, and I just tend to make stacks on the extra desk in my office, on my desk at home, and anywhere I am working. I get done, and I'm tired so instead of putting things away, they just stay in the stacks. Yuck!

She sat at the bar and sipped on her red wine. It wasn’t spectacular, but it was the best that this wine bar had, and after all she wasn’t here to sample the alcohol selection. The white daisy sat in her hair and displayed her intention to whoever was doing to walk through that door and recognize her.
Online dating wasn’t going that well for Lisa, the problem being that most of the guys who she met on the site were either losers who weren’t worth her time or were just cruising for some simple casual sex. Not that she didn’t enjoy herself with some of the latter kind of suitor, but it wasn’t her final goal anyway. After six months of nothing serious, she was about ready to move on.
Jeremy’s profile wasn’t different from the rest of the ones that she had set up with before: typical active guy picture with him throwing some frisbee in a park, interests like sports, gaming, and comedy TV shows. The thing that set him apart from the rest was his communication. She couldn’t put her finger on it to begin with, but it was somehow more sophisticated that the rest of the people she had conversed with.
It started with the usual “you’re cute” type of message but quickly progressed until he was talking about philosophy, the universe and human nature. She started checking her email in the mornings before work just to see if there was something there. It was the highlight of the day when the email noise dinged and she saw that it was more words from his mind to her.
Ian Rapoport of NFL Media reports that Samuel had a procedure to fix an irregular heartbeat and it is likely to keep him from playing against the Cowboys on Sunday. Panthers coach Ron Rivera didn’t disclose the nature of Samuel’s issue on Tuesday http://www.kansascitychiefsteamonline.com/patrick-mahomes-ii-jersey , but did say that Samuel was waiting for word from a physician.
“He’s dealing with a medical issue,” Rivera said, via the Charlotte Observer. 鈥淗e saw the doctor today Harrison Phillips Jersey , so we鈥檒l wait to see what the doctor has to say.鈥?/p>
Samuel, a 2017 second-round pick, had 15 catches for 115 yards before going on injured reserve last year.
At the tail end of the Titans’ offseason program Kyle Emanuel Jersey , quarterback Marcus Mariota said that he would be gathering the team’s receivers for workouts before the start of training camp later this month.
Mariota didn’t say exactly when those workouts would take place, but Jim Wyatt of the team’s website reports that the quarterback brought his teammates together in Nashville on Saturday and Sunday.
Wide receivers Corey Davis, Rishard Matthews William Hayes Jersey , Taywan Taylor and Tajae Sharpe joined Mariota and tight end Jonnu Smith for workouts in California early in the offseason. Wyatt reports some of those players were in Nashville over the weekend as well as others that weren’t involved in the first round of work, but there’s no full account of who was at these sessions.
Matthews and Davis missed time in the offseason because of injuries and the Titans are running a new offense under coordinator Matt LaFleur this season, so any extra work should be beneficial as the team tries to build on last year’s playoff appearance.

In the meantime, here are a few tidbits of information about one of the cute projects shown on the MBS post.
Pretty in Pink - Grunge was created using acrylic templates to guide a special free motion quilting foot on my domestic machine.
If you've not tried quilting with templates or rulers, you're missing out on a great creative avenue.
Consider learning the basics of ruler work by taking a class at your local shop, viewing online *free* YouTube clips and/or jumping on-board with a Crafsty class or two (see suggestions below).
I so enjoy stitching these lightly spaced feathers and tendrils inspired by Bethanne Nemesh -- a variation of "Nemeshing".
To enter the giveaway, leave me a comment telling me which project you like best on the Moda Bake Shop Basics post.
Jump over, read the reviews, check out the trailers and get on-board with one of these great classes.
Of course, if you have the opportunity to take a class in your local shop or at a show -- I ALWAYS recommend doing that first or in-addition-to an online course.
I enjoyed.reading your free motion tips that you published today. I especially appreciated your detailed information I Am just venturing into free motion quilting and find the tension issue to be standing in the way of my being able to improve. The tips on having your machine flush with the table makes a lot of sense and is probably another reason I'm struggling but when I see pieces of work like your small pink quilt I think it's worth trying to figure out. Thanks for sharing.
Your Redbird and Berries Mini quilt just can't be beat. I love it every time I see it. Thanks for a chance to win those rulers.
I just love the Family Tree Envelope Pillow. And your fast feathers and swirls are wonderful! There is so much to learn from your MBS post, I'll have to go through it a bunch of times. Thanks for sharing!
All of the work was beautiful and the information was great. I am looking forward to the next installment. I am particularly interested in ruler work on my domestic so I have to go with Chevron with a Twist. Hoping you'll be in Texas sometime!
They are all gorgeous but the Redbird and berries has caught my eye ever since I first saw it. On my want to do list for a while now!
How do I just pick one favorite on Moda…? The Chevron with a Twist is gorgeous, the Hearts Content Decorative Pillow would make a great gift for my mom or anyone! Love them all!
Si am a moda bake shop follower that found you here I love the red bird and berries. And I can not wait for the rest of your free motion series. Thanks for the chance to win. Drhodes9@cox.net.
I really enjoyed your recipe on Moda Bakeshop today and loved every quilted piece you shared. I especially liked the first pink piece because of how the quilting was the star. Thanks for the inspiration and great instruction...now I just need a bit more practice and I will be off and running!
The Redbirds has always been a favorite of mine but I especially liked the feather galaxy today. It was really helpful reading those tips. I didn't know there were special feet for using the rulers. Very helpful tips. Thanks.
The Moda recipe was a great tutorial of the basics, always good the review the basics! I liked everything I've seen of your work. It's gorgeous quilting! Now I have a new inspiration to work toward! The rulers would be a great help too.
Karen, your work is stunning as usual! There's nothing I DON'T love! From your signature Redbird to the gorgeous Feather Garden Lattice, everything you do is just beautiful! Great "lesson" on Bake Shop, will be using repeatedly! lstangl482 at aol dot com
Pick one?? Love the pillow, just beautiful! Love the chevron twist quilt, and the center of chevron shuffle. Your quilting is beautiful and very inspiring! Please continue to share.
It is so hard to choose a favorite because they are all so beautiful!! However, if I had to pick one it would be the bright pink sample "Ruler Work with Free Flowing Flowers" because feathers have always been a favorite of mine and ruler work is something I have long wanted to do. I just can't imagine being able to do that, but hopefully this old dog can learn a new trick!! Love all your work and thank you for so generously sharing your tips with us.
Love getting your blog on email. Body position, that's probably my biggest problem, thanks for the tips. Would love to see a video on those free form feathers & try rulers!
I like Feather Galaxy and Pretty in Pink. I need to try wool batting. The feathers look so pretty with that. Thanks for the info.
Your quilting is amazing! I love them all but having to choose one is so hard. Your Cone Flower needle appliqué is gorgeous. I love the feathers placement. Thanks for the tips. I've never used rulers before and would love to give it a go after seeing your beautiful designs.
I really like wholecloth quilts, and my favorite is Feather Galaxy, though Pretty in Pink is a close second!
I still love your redbird and berries quilt the best - It draws me back every time. thank you for sharing such wonderful tips and tricks
I love the redbird and berries. I'm drawn to them for winter quilts. Your tips are wonderful and now bookmarked!
I have always loved the redbird and berries, but also very fond of the hearts content pillow. Decisions, decisions. . . :-) Thanks for all you share with us. robinsheloratearthlinkdotnet
I. Am. So. Jealous. I love all of the projects you shared with us. Sigh, I just need to practice, practice, practice. Thanks for the giveaway!
You are so very talented. Love them all; but if I had to chose just one it would be the Cone Flower Needle Applique. Your work is remarkable. Thanks for the give-away.
Great post on the Bakeshop! I looking forward to the next chapter. My favorite project is the Heart's Content pillow.
Honestly - I liked the Chevron Shuffle! the colors and the stitching! I also used your link to 'grab' a class, too! I can use *all* the help I can get in learning more about FMQing! I'd love to win the rulers - that would give me additional challenge! Thanks for all your inspiration! :-)
I like them all...if I have to pick one then I probably go for the Feathered Garden Lattice. Lovely FMQ. Great post, enjoyed looking at all of them.
I think my heart skipped a beat when I saw Heart's Content Decorative Pillow! How I adore that pillow and would love to be able to make one like it! Such a beauty.
This is the post on Facebook where I shared your blog post. Your work is beautiful! https://www.facebook.com/?_rdr=p
Chevron with a twist caught my eye. I love how you quilted that one. Thank-you for the opportunity to win the rulers also
I too am absolutely crazy in love with the Heart's Content Pillow. I am trying to figure out how I am going to save this wonderful Moda Bake Shop post. I have already shared it and will leave another comment about that. I just save too much stuff and I don't want this to get lost in all of that, ha ha.
Posted on my FB time line - Marti Morgan - pinned it to my Pininterest page and bookmarked the site. Gosh I want to do this so badly!!!
I love all your work including the recent Pretty in Pink in Grunge, Chevron Shuffle, and Simply Spring Fleur. Your quilting on a domestic machine is beautiful and inspiring. I haven't tried template or ruler work yet. My struggles with tension, needle, etc. are discouraging then I go to your blog and website and feeling positive again.
Your Moda Bakeshop post was very helpful. I am not fearless when it comes to fmq on my home machine but have tried something new with each quilt I make. None of my work is "professional" looking but it's all mine and full of love. I especially liked your very little bird piece. I could see many quilting possibilities for a quilt that size! I may start a tryptic today!
I have been FMQing for many years but was just reminded of several things that I should pay more attention to. I have been tempted to buy the rulers but just can't do it yet. Love your work.
I love your Redbird and Berries. It's what caught my eye when I started following you. Your quilting is amazing!
I really enjoyed your Moda Bake Shop post today Karen! You definitely shared great information for free motion quilting! Beautiful quilt!
Although I love cardinals, your Feathered Galaxy just sings for me. I see ocean waves rushing up on the beach at Sanabel Island in that piece and part of it is the fabric color. Thanks for all the tutorials you do!
Such beautiful quilting! My favourite would have to be Feather Galaxy, although it was a tough choice! Thank you for all the inspiration!
I love the beautiful quilting. I just can't seem to get the hang of machine quilting. I so want to learn this but time and maybe patience plays a big part. I will keep trying. The pink grunge piece is beautiful, I wish I could take one of your classes. Going to be in St Louis anytime soon?
I love the doodles and the chevron shuffle, they are both sastify my need for contemporary and classic combined perfectly!
My favorite is the Hearts Content pillow...but I love seeing all your free motion and ruler work! Hoping to take a class from you in the future....I don't have the hang of domestic machine quilting yet...but you inspire me!
Well, I knew choosing a favorite was going to be near impossible, because I follow everything you do and always love it! However, your Hearts Content Pillow is quite magnificent and looks like something I could actually make! Karen, thanks for this opportunity. Kristy aka quilterkg
Your quilting is amazing! I really want to leant FMQ using my home machine. Thank you for all your tips and information. I love everything! I think the Red Bird and the Cone Flowers are my top two.
It was so difficult to choose a favorite: each was more stunning than the last. I guess I would have to say the Coneflower was perhaps that teeny-tiny more breathtaking! Thanks for the chance!
I love Red Bird and Berries but I also love Coneflower!!! Your creations are beautiful and your tips have been very helpful!! Thanks!!
To be honest, your Redbird and berries is what caught my eye from the very beginning and why I started following you! It's still my #1 favorite because my younger brother, who is handicapped loves everything Cardinals....including the St Louis variety! Lol it always reminds me of David! ❤ stunning work!💕💕💕💕
Thank you for the opportunity to win the templates! So excited about this giveaway and the possibility of creating beautiful quilts with them by using your courses! ❤❤
Those QP rulers have been on my wish list for many many months now. It's hard to decide thread or rulers. Well you have to quilt so you need thread first. Rulers still on wish list
So many beautiful quilts to choose from but I do love birds so I would have to pick Red Bird and berries mini quilt. Thanks for the giveaway!
Absolutely love the Red Bird and Berries. Your blog is so informative. I just love it! avollm @ fuse.net
I have always loved your Simple Spring Fleur. The piecing as well as the quilting was beautiful. I would also love to see a tutorial on your free feathers and how you fill in odd shaped spaces with those. I would also love to win the quilting templates from Linda. You have taught me so much since I started following you. Thank you for all you do!
The feathered borders on your garden quilt are spectacular. I have never tried rulers and think I will try the class by Angela so thank you for the discount. You are generous to share your knowledge and talent
Hey Karen, I follow you on IG--your quilting is very inspiring, as is your enthusiasm! My favorite piece on the Moda post is the red cardinal, I know you do that one a lot. I have the QP curves, but no straight rulers. Thanks for the contest.
The Chevron Shuffle is amazing! I'm pretty good at stippling, but really need to expand my abilities and these rulers would go a long way to helping me do that. Thanks for a great giveaway!
I have been following on Instagram, you have been very inspiring for my own doodle time and quilting those doodles. I would love to be able to add some ruler work to that. I will have to say that A Quilter’s Doodles with Needle & Thread are my favorite. It brings out the quilter's creative side and personality more I think.
Although I've long been enamored of your Red Bird & Berries quilting project, I really liked the Feather Galaxy with circles on the aqua Grunge pictured in your Bake Shop FMQ Basics posting.
your quilting is gorgeous, my favorite project is Chevron Shuffle because i think it is something a beginner like me could do
I love the whole cloth quilting and all your tips. You are so great about sharing all your design techniques.
I really like the red bird and berries. When I was a child, we lived in Houston, Texas. We had a bird feeder and watched many families of cardinals at the feeder. ljbisme at msn dot com
I love the pillow tutorial. I've even made one and it turned out great. I will be sharing your giveaway on Facebook.
My fav is probably the cone flowers because I love cone flowers in all shapes, sizes, and mediums, LOL. But then my eye caught the chevron shuffle, hmmmmm. A new favorite? Do I really have to pick just one?
Karen....all of your quilts on the blog are exceptionally stunning, but I am particularly drawn to the chevron with a twist.....I have a chevron quilt on my "to do" list as well as some applique and this ties the 2 together so beautifully....thanks for the inspiration!!!
Oh my gosh how do I choose!!! Cone Flower fell in love with and attended your class for needle turn .. the Chevron with a twist the wonderful flowers I remember being in awe then after the trunk show how to make them! Every creation you do is so unique and inspirational. I really can't pick one with all the feathers and other free motion designs that leads me to thank you so so much for the class I attended for FMQ you are the BEST instructor as before then I had never quilted. Thanks again for all the tips and tricks.
Well, this is like answering 'which of your children do you like best?'!!!!! Your designs are wonderful and the quilting exquisite, and you know I have used your family tree pillow in wall hanging variations, but I am a bit partial to cardinals so lean towards the Redbird and Berries mini-quilt. You are a continual inspiration and generous to share so abundantly. Thank you! Ruth from Michigan
Like them all but the Redbird & Berries mini is my favorite. You are such an inspiration and if I will practice more, I will get better. Someday I hope to get to the ruler stage! Thanks sew much! Diane
The really mini red bird and berries is overall favorite quilt. I love all the FMQ. You make look easy. Like I could do it. Thank you for your tutorials. I am posting you on my fb page.
I love the fact that you offered a FMQ along for 2016 and I'm going to go back and work through it. I hope you'll do another one in 2017. You really have a gift for teaching!
I love all the quilts you share here and at Moda Bake Shop but the the coneflowers quilt is calling my name.
I have to say "Chevron with a Twist" has to be my favourite as it is this quilt that I first found you Karen.
Well, it was a hard choice. I just love that Heart's Content Decorative Pillow though so it wins first place IMHO! The Redbird & Berries mini was spectacular too, I must say.

Hello. I ordered your complete set of Basement Finishing Videos on 2/3/14 so let me begin by saying that I have watched almost all of your videos and can’t imagine doing my basement project without them. Prior to purchasing this video set I was buying as many books on the different basement topics as possible. The reason I was constantly buying different books and some multiples on the same topic was because none of them were ever 100% clear on the steps of doing things. Your videos solved that. Thank you very much. I have already begun recommending your videos to my friends.Thanks a bunch.
A membership to Basement Finishing University includes everything you need to finish your own basement:

Here you can learn how to finish the entire basement project yourself or partially finish your basement with the help of subcontractors. Whatever goals you have for your basement, chances are we can help you achieve them.

Last Friday, so-called "conservative" commentator Tomi Lahren publicly declared she was pro-choice during her guest appearance on the largely left-leaning morning talk show, The View. She claimed that as a small-government "constitutional," it would be hypocritical to believe government should ban abortion. She's wrong.

Kudirkos Naumiestis was called the lost city. During the World War II, this area was almost completely destroyed. The city, located at the confluence of the Šešupė and the Širvinta, was called Wladislawowo (in honour to the ruler Vladislav Vasa) before the First World War, then it was called Naumiestis, and since 1934 it was named Kudirkos Naumiestis because Vincas Kudirka, a famous Lithuanian national revival character in the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, lived and worked there. He was Lithuanian physician, novelist, poet, writer, critic, translator, the editor of the newspaper "Varpas" (The Bell), one of the ideologues of the Lithuanian national movement, and the author of Lithuanian anthem.
The name Kudirkos Naumiestis perpetuates the life of the doctor, writer and the herald of national revival in the tsarist era Vincas Kudirka in this town, so called since 1934 when monument to Vincas Kudirka (sculptor Vincas Grybas) was built in the central square of the city. Dr. Vincas Kudirka Museum is in V.Kudirka St. It was founded in 1960. Over the years the value of the museum and the exhibits increased. It was decided to set up a new fund for the construction of the museum, and a new museum building opened its doors on 5 December, 1998 as a branch of the Lithuanian National Museum. By the way, the museum stands on the site where once stood the house, where the herald of national revival spent his last days of his life. The period of National liberation determined the themes of the exposure of the museum: local history and the “bell-ringers” (according to the newspaper “The Bell”). Part of the exposition is dedicated to Naumiestis and its surrounding history, as well as to the enlightened people originating from the region. The second part of the exhibition is dedicated to the “bell-ringers” and the most eminent of them - Vincas Kudirka.
Dr. Vincas Kudirka, and other famous people of this region are buried in the cemetery of Kudirkos Naumiestis.
In Kudirkos Naumiestis you can also visit on behalf of the Invention of St. Cross consecrated two towers brick church, which was launched in 1781 and completed just in 1870, the chapel, the homestead of a self-taught artist Pranas Sederevičius, Irena and Antanas Spranaičiai’ museum “Širvinta Corner”, the civil Orthodox cemetery and church, the bridges over the Šešupė and the Širvinta.

I was reading a book this morning -"The Artist's Way" by Julia Cameron where the author says we cannot do it alone. Though the artist's journey is solitary yet we are so connected. I felt I need to connect with a community who feels the same way, who are going with the same self doubt sometimes ( would my art sell?) , and the very next moment may have a brilliant idea about putting together a design and feel great.
The new community has nothing to do with my existing friends. My existing friends from other area and my family may understand and know me for a while, yet may have no clue what I go through as an artist.
I call myself artist? Well, why not? We all are, except most of us , grown ups, do not dare to unleash that. May be I am a mediocre one, but hey, I do get all the artist's bug bite for sure.
To connect, I found a fellow jewelry artist from the Etsy site whose work I liked and hearted her, went to her blog and left a comment. I think that's a pretty good start for me.

"Most High, glorious God, cast Your Light into the darkness of my heart, and grant me a right faith, certain hope and perfect charity, sense and understanding, Lord, so that I may know and do Your holy and true command." - St. Francis of Assisi: Prayer before the Crucifix
A little girl was showing her mother her collection of dolls one day. The mother asked, “Which one do you love most?” The girl pointed to a miserable, tattered looking doll and said that was her favorite. “Why do you love that doll most?” the mother asked. The girl answered, “Because that one needs my love more than the rest.”
Our second reading the First Letter of John reminded us, “Beloved, let us love one another because love is of God.” In fact, our Scriptures today and all week have focused on the nature of love – God’s love for us and His command that we love each other.
But, language is such an imprecise thing. Just think of how imprecise the word love is. We use the same word to talk about ice cream, music, spouses, and even God. Surely the way we love ice cream is different from the way we love God. In Greek, which most of the New Testament was written in, there are actually different words for love. The two used in the New Testament are philia or the love between friends; and agape, which is love in its highest form. Agape is the word used most often and it’s the one that St. John is using today when he speaks of the love from God that we are called to imitate in our own lives.
John today paints for us a picture of God’s love tells us why we should love, what love is about, and how we are to love. So, why love? Then John tells us why. “Because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.” John reminds us that love is from God, it finds its origin, its starting point in God. Living a life of love, therefore, is the way to be sure that we know God and that we are children of God; born of God. On the flip side, he tells us that if you don’t have love for others then quite simply you cannot know God. It is this simple: If we have love in our lives, we have God in our lives; and if we do not have love in our lives, we cannot have God either. God and love are two different words that mean the same thing. You cannot separate one from the other.
For example, we cannot claim to love God and have no care for the hungry, the homeless, the poor, the needy, the sick, and so on. To love God is to love them – all of them; in fact, especially those who are often difficult to love; or who have no love in their lives. To grow in our knowledge and love of God, we must endeavor to grow in our knowledge and love of our brothers and sisters, especially those most in need.
So, what does God’s love look like, and how does it differ from natural human love? John gives us a practical example. He says, “God’s love was revealed among us in this way: God sent his only Son into the world so that we might live through him.” So, Jesus is what God’s love looks like. Unlike much of human love, which is driven by self-interest, God is moved to love us not because He needed something but because we needed something which only He can give.
Human love starts with the question, “What is in it for me?” God’s love begins with the question, “What can I do for you?” Human love comes because we want to receive something, something like feeling good in the other’s company. God’s love it is about giving. That is why God’s gift of His only Son on the Cross becomes a climactic sign of the way God loves us and the model for the way we should love one another.
Finally, John brings his point home, “In this is love, not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins.” My friends, God loves us unconditionally, God love us perfectly, completely, personally, and generously; God gives Himself to us in His Son; God’s love is freely, eagerly given.
We can sometimes view the command to love as just one of many things that God asks of us. Today John teaches us that love is, in fact, the only commandment; it is the source and motivation for all the other commandments. It should in fact be what defines our lives as believers. As they said of the Christians in Antioch so many centuries ago, should be said of us today, “See how these Christians love.”
May God, our loving Father, who is love itself; love incarnate, help us to purify our love for Him and multiply our love for one another, so that we can love as generously and as unconditionally as He loves us.
Beautiful reflection! Sometimes, I think, we can hear a quote repeatedly to the point where we somehow miss the meaning. Then, somehow, that whisper of God strikes home and "Wow"! We were recently learning a new hymn in chapel and the refrain--which we kept repeating--was "This is the Body of Christ." I don't know how many times we repeated it but all of a sudden, on one of the refrains, I could think only of an individual with whom I've been having a difficult time! Sometimes this God of mine really knows how to get my attention!

Most of the cruises start nearby the Eiffel Tower (though the Vedettes du Pont Neuf start from the Cité Island not far from Notre Dame). They generally start and end at the same point
The boats pass along many beautiful monuments of Paris such as Le Louvre, the Cathedral of Notre dame, the Eiffel Tower, Alexandre III bridge, the Pont Neuf, The Musée d’orsay, …and more. Without any stop.
You leave the Batobus then take it again later during the same day (if you’ve booked a one day ticket) (Unlimited transportation for an entire day).
Bad point : The tour lasts longer (than the Vedette du Pont Neuf tour) as it stops several times and the itinerary is longer than the Vedettes du Pont Neuf’s itinerary . So, if you want to do the entire tour, it will take about 2 hours, instead of 1 hour with the Vedettes du Pont Neuf.
You’d like to get a real feel of an authentic Paris, the Paris of the Parisians and get full of tips from a native ?
You’d like to see Paris in another perspective and to know more about Paris and Parisians’s life and culture ?
The tours are private (with you only or you and the person you choose), at your pace and customized according to your wishes and interests
from 10.30am to around 10pm (check the departures schedule on their website as they are different according to the period of the year)
The tickets can be booked on line, but generally it’s easy to buy the ticket at the counter. They are available for a year

Development of evaluation as a profession worldwide. Development of professional evaluation communities. Teaching evaluation. Evaluation practice. Evaluation theory.
It says, in particular, that the "proposed candidates must agree to be fully available for Board work during their term. More specifically, each candidate will be asked to sign a letter of agreement stipulating his/her:
Availability and accessibility by phone for periodic Board conference calls during the three-year term,
Understanding that he/she is not eligible to receive an AEA-sponsored award during the three-year term,
This is a great opportunity and honor to serve on the AEA Board and I deeply appreciate AEA Board members for contributing their time and effort to run this outstanding association. Their commitment goes far beyond the above mentioned points. I used to be actively involved with 4 professional associations' governing bodies and can witness that it is exciting but often overwhelming, which reminded me of Parkinson's approach to inviting candidates. He suggests that advantages and drawbacks should be balanced so that the only one ideal candidate will show up:
"Wanted — An archaeologist with high academic qualifications willing to spend fifteen years in excavating the Inca tombs at Helsdump on the Alligator River. Knighthood or equivalent honor guaranteed. Pension payable but never yet claimed. Salary of ￡2000 (or $6000 U.S.) per year. Apply in triplicate to the Director of the Grubbenburrow Institute, Sickdale, Ill., U.S.A".
Here the advantages and drawbacks are neatly balanced. There is no need to insist that candidates must be patient, tough, intrepid, and single."
The first annual conference of the Russian Association of Specialists in Program and Policy Evaluation (RASPPE) will take place on October 29-31, 2015 in Moscow at MIRBIS (Moscow International Higher Business School). The conference theme is “Program and policy evaluation in Russia: becoming a profession”. The conference goal is to put together a comprehensive picture of how program and policy evaluation develops in various areas. The presenters are invited to discuss a broad range of topics related to evaluation including evaluation methodology, evaluation research, evaluation standards, evaluation practice etc. The conference organizers plan to have pre-conference professional development workshops on October 29th. Deadline for presentation proposal submissions is April 30, 2015. Registration of conference participants will be open on May 29, 2015 after the workshops and conference programs are published. Conference working language is Russian. Conference website is at http://www.eval.ru/conferences
International Program Evaluation Network 14th annual conference took place in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan this year. The conference went very well. Deputy Speaker of the National Parliament made a presentation at the opening plenary. Several deputies of the parliament, representatives of a number of ministries, specialists from the Presidential Administration attended the conference, made presentations and took part in the discussions. The conference was well attended - we had about 140 participants registered - mostly from Kyrgyzstan and the neighboring Kazakhstan. About 10 participants came from Russia, quite a few people - from Ukraine. There were participants from Tajikistan, Moldova and Georgia. We even had a guest from Israel - Barbara Rosenstein came to talk about the national evaluation polcies study she recently completed. The 4 pre-conference workshops were conducted by specialists from the South Africa, England and Russia (including myself). 50 presentations were selected by the conference committee. The quality of presentations was very good. The conference web page is available in English. You may look at the conference program as well as at the program of the pre-conference workshops.
International Program Evaluation Network (IPEN) is a regional VOPE (volunteer organization of professional evaluators) founded in 2000. Since then IPEN had annual conferences in Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan (2 times), Moldova, Russia (4) and Ukraine (2). This year IPEN conference takes place in Kyrgyzstan for the first time. The four pre-conference workshops took place today and were well attended (overall about 80 participants). The workshops were conducted by specialists from the South Africa, UK and Russia. My workshop was on the use of theory of change in program planning and evaluation. About 140 participants are expected tomorrow and the day after tomorrow at the conference. The conference and pre-conference workshops programs are available at the conference website in Russian and in English.
Yes, another post on the rejected proposals - still thinking about it and reflecting on what Tom Grayson wrote in his comment to the previous post. Relax, this is not going to be too personal :)
It occurred to me that there might be more people sharing their thoughts and feelings on the rejected conference presentations. I found out right away that sometimes the rejection of their presentation proposal makes people pretty angry and upset. In some cases such situation is even painful and traumatic. I could easily picture those two elderly professionals whose proposal was rejected: "Here we were, two HR Pros, I mean really two friends living a dream, wanting to go unpaid and share our wisdom, share our souls, with our brothers and sisters."
Interestingly, some people shared thoughts and experiences that were similar to mine: "I also had to remember this won’t be the only time where I can speak about my work in a professional setting. Case in point: I had a manuscript submission approved the same week I got rejected for the presentation above…funny how that worked out."
There are some good jokes such as: "If all the sales assistants at the shoe stores felt rejected they would spend most of their time crying, feeling sad, unwanted and rejected and never make another sale!" And some positive recommendations: "Believe in yourself and others will believe in you."
“We appreciate the hard work that goes into preparing a submission and regret that we are unable to place your proposal in this year’s program”. This is a message one receives in the case when his/her AEA presentation proposal is rejected.
I joined AEA in 1999 and submitted my first presentation proposal in 2000. Since then I attended all the AEA conferences except one and submitted proposals 12 times. I used to co-chair the ICCE TIG and know how the proposal review process works. 4 times my proposals were rejected (including the last two years – 2013 and 2014) - enough to discuss some lessons learned.
Let me just mention that I have been actively practicing evaluation since 1996 – nationally and internationally, received my PhD in evaluation in the US, published quite a few articles in English and in Russian, edited a book in Russian, conducted dozens of evaluation workshops in different countries and made numerous presentations at various conferences (national and international). Hence, I am a professional evaluator and a committed AEA member, but not just a stranger who happens to visit the AEA events occasionally.
The first one – long time ago – included stuff that was important for us here in Russia and the Newly Independent States but probably was not really ‘hot’ for the AEA conference. It was rejected for a good reason.
The second proposal that was rejected included the results of my PhD study and some reflections on my evaluation practice. The paper I was going to present was published later as a book chapter, and I presented it at the AEA conference in a slightly different format next year.
The third rejected proposal (2013) was developed in line with the AEA president’s message who invited us to use our evaluation skills to reflect upon our evaluation practice. It was based on the 25 years of my consulting experience in an extremely dynamic, diverse and complex environment and included some lessons learned and recommendations. I thought that it was interesting, but it did not fly. Working on it was fun though!
This year I was going to talk about evaluator competencies in the national context. My presentation proposal was based on the article published in the Canadian Journal of Evaluation this year. I was going to use the concepts described in that article and further develop them in the presentation. AEA was unable to place my proposal in this year’s program, but I will discuss the proposed topic at our regional and national conferences this fall.
Working on a presentation proposal when taken seriously is a useful process per se, and results in some product that might be used in various ways – not only at the AEA conference.
When the presentation proposal is rejected, it does not necessarily mean that it turned out to be a complete garbage. It may work next time or in a different setting.
The major reasons for attending the AEA conferences for me are learning and networking. If there is a chance to share some ideas in a form of presentation, it’s an additional benefit. But I would never miss a conference due to the fact that my proposal is rejected. The tickets and hotel are booked. Look forward to attending another outstanding AEA conference and meeting friends and colleagues in Denver!
You may be interested to learn about the # of results of Google search for each of the above mentioned terms. I looked for exact phrases like "difference between evaluation and research" and inserted quotes in the search string to do so. Here is my 'theory': the more often people get confused about the difference between evaluation and other things, the more often they clarify this issue on the web, and the more Google search results we get. Try to guess before you open the Diagram 1 (under the cut)...

Cybersecurity consulting is a growing field in cybersecurity. A major shortage in qualified cybersecurity personnel has made it difficult for companies to hire permanent help in this area. Add to that a preference of many millennials and others entering the workforce for a more flexible, self-determined work schedule, and working with a consultant seems like a logical choice for companies.
Evaluating an IT system from the outside of the company’s existing IT workforce can have its advantages. Consultants may be more objective about flaws in the system than the person or people who built the system, and may be able to catch vulnerabilities better. Just having a second perspective on the network’s vulnerabilities can be a positive thing when trying to figure out how a hacker could get in.
Evaluating the current system is the first step in cybersecurity consulting services. After identifying vulnerabilities or even discovering a breach that has already occurred, consultants may be tasked with building a secure system or making the current system more secure. Training existing personnel about risks, safe behaviors, and how to navigate the new system could also be a part of a cybersecurity consultant’s job.
A major shortage in qualified cybersecurity personnel has made it difficult for companies to hire permanent help in the cybersecurity area.
Some cybersecurity consultants are freelancers who work under contract for one or more clients, while others work for a cybersecurity firm and take on clients assigned to them. Assignments could be full- or part-time, and consultants could potentially be working for more than one company or organization at a time. Consulting could be a good fit for a knowledgeable cybersecurity professional who likes new challenges and doesn’t want to be tied down to one company indefinitely.
It’s important to know the latest developments in consulting and cybersecurity in order to properly discover and counter security threats. Advanced degrees and certifications, as well as some experience in the IT field, are usually expected. If a cybersecurity consultant is working freelance or has their own consulting company, payment is usually on a contract basis and includes few, if any, benefits. Those working with a firm may be paid a salary and benefits like any other full-time employee or be contracted through that firm.
Cybersecurity consulting services could be advantageous for both sides of the equation. For companies, they can get cybersecurity help without hiring a full-time, permanent employee. They can also get an outside perspective, and it may be easier to hire a consultant than a regular employee when cybersecurity talent is scarce.
The consultants themselves can gain experience rapidly working for several companies at once, and income potential could be much higher if they are willing to work more hours. Alternatively, consultants could also work fewer hours if they have family responsibilities or other commitments that would prevent them from taking a full-time job.

England, 1959. Free-spirited widow Florence Green (Emily Mortimer) risks everything to open a bookshop in a conservative East Anglian coastal town. While bringing about a surprising cultural awakening through works by Ray Bradbury and Vladimir Nabokov, she earns the polite but ruthless opposition of a local grand dame (Patricia Clarkson) and the support and affection of a reclusive book loving widower (Bill Nighy). As Florence’s obstacles amass and bear suspicious signs of a local power struggle, she is forced to ask: is there a place for a bookshop in a town that may not want one? Based on Penelope Fitzgerald’s acclaimed novel and directed by Isabel Coixet (Learning to Drive), The Bookshop is an elegant yet incisive rendering of personal resolve, tested in the battle for the soul of a community.

William – wait, I should jump on the “cool” bandwagon and say “Will” – is turning SWEET SIXTEEN. Pardon me, perhaps I should say MACHO/MANLY SIXTEEN (whatever that means). Whatever you call it, it’s not right. I saw him yanked from his Mother’s womb with the Ominous Salad Tongs (That’s the official medical term. Well, it SHOULD BE). In other words, since it’s all about me, that makes me VERY OLD. In fact, two days ago I became THIS old!!! That’s just crazy.
Awwww – the glasses! I wish there was a shot of the eye patch somewhere… (That was all because he had amblyopia – double amblyopia, if I remember correctly.) Although that would remind me of the time, right after he got the eye patch, that I took him to the amphitheatre where I was in many shows so he could see them working on the set (you know, with super-cool power tools) and I turned my back for one second and he walked right off the edge of the concrete stage. Luckily it wasn’t a long drop… You see, as I, myself, learned years later from donning on eye patch in a play, you have essentially no depth perception when you’re wearing the thing.
But now, his vision is corrected, he’s grown tall and has a basso profundo voice, and he’s…he’s…(can I say it?) A STRAPPING YOUNG MAN!
Compare this to LAST year’s “Party of Five”. A few notable differences are evident. Most importantly, I AM FREAKIN’ OLD! Secondly, Anders is crying because his fly is down. We were all thinking that it was because he was tired of the process (as he’d already spent good energy looking dashing for his own portrait – I’ll post that soon), but looking at a very large version of the picture today I realized that he is suffering from the abject humiliation that they are going to let his image – FOR ALL POSTERITY – be captured with his zipper undone. And they had the unmitigated GALL to try and pacify him with a BALL (see how he holds it pleadingly in the air). Worst of all, he is not quite dexterous enough to fix it himself and hasn’t yet the vocabulary to say, “Pardon me, could someone assist me in zipping up my pants?”
But back to Will. I’ve been known to give him a bad time (just once in a great while, right?), but it’s only because I want him to not talk with his mouth full, or speak in that voice that uses ALL THOSE EXTRANEOUS DECIBELS, or have questionable personal hygiene for when he goes on a hot dates. See, Will? I’ve only been thinking of you. And that’s because I love you! I nag you with love.
Strapping… Anywho.. at least he got a hair cut… no offence, oh and he never looks at this site so I can say all I want! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!! Anywhatsit… I remember when he had his first set of glasses, I might even have them somewhere still although I don’t know why… They were I beleive raggedy Andy, or something? I remember the ominous purchase. All fuzzy-like in my head.
*giggles* I also remember him running into large glass walls in the mall when he saw something shiney-My term for interesting distractables as you well know. It really doesn’t have to be shiney although it helps.- It was funny and sad at the same time. He was soo SMALL!! What happened to the wee little thing that I so ruthlessly -and still do although with different and ‘loving’ form- torchured?
It is so wrong! I wonder…. when are we going to tell pickle about the mistake with his birth certificate? He is trully ten…. or maybe not because that would mean he had been shaveing since he was five…. *thinks* anyway…. Happy Birthday!
I can’t believe he is 16…kind of like how I still can’t belive Sarah is 18. They were only 8 and 10 when I lived in Orem! I had SO much fun with them – one should ALWAYS have a Sarah and a William when sick with mono and celiac disease 🙂

Why would a college student secretly film his roommate having sex and post it on the internet? What was he thinking? He clearly was not concerned about the painful humiliation the roommate would experience—or he simply didn’t care. The outcome of his lack of empathy was a talented young man jumping to his death from a bridge. Why is it that people feel free to spew any kind of bile on the internet or Facebook? Do they imagine the disembodied other at the receiving end of their vituperation cannot be wounded—or do they simply not care? Why do people shrug their shoulders at environmental degradation, warnings of the effects of global warming or the growing misery of the declining middle class and the wretched poor? Are they genuinely unconcerned about the legacy they are leaving their children and grandchildren? Or are they motivated by their own comfort and pleasure above all? What is happening to us? Are we losing our capacity to identify with the other or to make any sacrifice for the common good? Are we growing so narcissistic, so inhumane, that we seek political and philosophical reasons to pander to our own petty indulgences?
I refuse to believe, for example, that anyone seriously believes the lunatic, ultra-individualistic, anti-democratic, self-indulgent “philosophy” of Ayn Rand. If her philosophy was actually followed there would be no human society. We would be reduced once again to what Rene Girard called “a war of all against all.” Only the most powerful, most vicious, least morally inhibited would prevail and that by brute force. Her vision approximates the world of Lord of the Flies. No. I can’t believe anyone takes her seriously. Her brash narcissism is touted up as a coherent vision of society and used by the greedy and powerful to justify what they were going to do anyway. It is an excuse for the powerful to keep the powerless in tow, for the already obscenely wealthy to become even more wealthy, and for adolescent fantasists to dream of life without moral limits.
What has happened to us? According to new studies by the University of Michigan this diminishment of empathy is not an illusion. Between 1979 and 2009 research on university students showed a significant decline in empathy. The studies of Sara Konrath, cited in the May-June issue of the Utne Reader, demonstrated that between those years “empathy plummeted.” The “greatest drop” was in “empathetic concern”—48%. “The second highest drop,” reports Konrath “was in “perspective taking, a measure of people’s innate tendency to imagine others’ point of view.” This fell 34%.
This speaks not only to the failure of society, but to the failure of the church. Are we helping members of Christian congregations to empathize with the struggles of others or are we rather enabling their narcissism by appealing to their already deeply ingrained consumerism and individualism? If we cannot address this in the church we will have difficulty addressing the growing viciousness of our indifference to and scorn for others in the wider society. The horrors of Ayn Rand’s vision may yet be realized.
I wonder if the empathy was ever there or do blogs and FB accounts allow an easy impersonal way to go public with our thoughts. Unfortunate how some in society seem to have separated the FB account or blog entry from the real person and treat our responses as if they are to a thing(account) instead of a person that is expressing a viewpoint. I suspect, that given the opportunity, most people would not express their thoughts the same way in person as they do in a blog entry or FB post.
I wonder if there is a connection between diminished imagination and lack of empathy. Children and youth spend less and less time creating their own thought pictures and alternate worlds and more and more viewing the created worlds of others. They are growing up in world where, as you travel from town to town, much of the commercial landscape is exactly the same (the Target in my town is just like the Target in your town.) It may seem an oversimplification, but there does seem to be less opportunity for imagination to develop, and we need the power of imagination to grasp how it feels to be inside the skin of another, and be able to empathize with them.
By Hope Hodge Seck FOB Sabit Qadam—The Sangin district of Helmand province once was known as one of the most combat-intensive regions in Afghanistan. The gains made in the area—pushing the insurgents back and making the region more secure for civilians—proved costly in Marine lives, particularly during 2010 and 2011. Three years later, while the Taliban do still maintain a presence here, it’s now the Afghan National Security Forces who patrol and engage with the enemy, as is the case throughout Helmand province. The Marines still remaining here, a contingent of fewer than 300 from Charlie Company, 1st Battalion, 7th…
By Hope Hodge Seck Camp Leatherneck–Greetings from Camp Leatherneck, a once-bustling base in Afghanistan’s Helmand province that is rapidly becoming a ghost town. Leatherneck is home to most of the 4,500 Marines remaining in Afghanistan, down from some 20,000 at the peak of fighting here. While the base still has a sprawling footprint, whole sections are emptying as units and elements complete their mission and go home. Meanwhile, Leatherneck is still home to an array of coalition troops, including Jordanian, Georgian, Estonian, and Danish forces, as well as some 2,500 British troops stationed at Camp Bastion, which borders Leatherneck. On…
A recent story by combat correspondent Cpl. Paul Peterson, offers a look into ongoing operations on the eve of the Afghanistan drawdown. The majority of U.S. and allied troops are slated to leave the country in 2014, but Marines in southern Afghanistan continue to engage in intense, hours-long firefights even as the Corps prepares to begin shipping men and equipment home. A few recent command shifts have taken place preceding the pull out including the handover of 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing forward to Col. Scott Jensen from Brig. Gen. Gary Thomas. But, those on patrol continue to take regular contact.…
A sergeant in the British Royal Marines was found guilty of murdering an insurgent during a court-martial on Friday, after helmet camera footage of him emerged showing him shooting the man in the chest at close-range. The man, identified only as marine A, faces a life in prison after being found guilty of murder, the Guardian reported. He and two other Royal Marines were on trial for their actions during a Sept. 2011 patrol in Afghanistan’s Helmand province. Royal Marine A was accused of dragging an insurgent who was hit in a helicopter attack to the side of a field…
More than 1,000 Marines with 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines, have returned from Afghanistan to Camp Pendleton, Calif., since Friday, the culmination of their seven-month deployment in northern Helmand province. As this Marine Corps news release points out, the unit was based primarily in Musa Qala and Now Zad districts, teaming with other units as part of Regimental Combat Team 6. Other infantry units in that RCT this summer included 1st Battalion, 8th Marines, out of Camp Lejeune, N.C., and 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, out of Twentynine Palms, Calif., both of which photographer James J. Lee and I visited this spring…
The next major phase of the drawdown of Marine forces in Afghanistan is nearly complete. Thousands of Marines have returned from Helmand province in the last few weeks, leaving behind a smaller force that is focused primarily on partnered security force assistance with Afghan National Security Forces, rather than offensive operations. Marine officials declined to say how many Marines remain, but have acknowledged previously that there could be as few as 7,000 by October. The overall number of U.S. forces in Afghanistan this fall is expected to drop to 68,000, the approximate same number as when President Obama ordered a…
As noted here, Maj. Gen. John Toolan turned over the reins of Regional Command Southwest yesterday to Maj. Gen. Charles Gurganus, who will lead Marine forces in Helmand and Nimroz provinces this summer. Toolan has repeatedly praised Mohammad Gulab Mangal, Helmand’s provincial governor for his leadership. The general cited Mangal jumping to action as one reason why Helmand didn’t have the same kind of violent protests other parts of the country did after U.S. soldiers burned Qurans at Bagram Air Base last month. To thank Mangal and other top Afghan officials for their year-long partnership, Toolan held a farewell dinner…
Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 365 — The Blue Knights — deployed to Afghanistan earlier this month to replace VMM-162 which conducted its last mission there Jan. 17. The Blue Knights out of Marine Corps Air Station New River, N.C., departed Jan. 6 and will take over resupply and transportation missions in Helmand province for 162 which spent six months at Camp Bastion. The Marines of 365 spent their final days at home preparing their Ospreys for an aircraft swap with the pilots of 162. Due to cost, units don’t take their own aircraft when they deploy. Instead they use Ospreys…
Maj. Gen. Richard Mills, commander of Marine forces in Afghanistan, took 30 minutes out of his busy schedule yesterday morning to discuss the state of his area of operations and the progress Marines have made there. Much of it will appear in a story in the print edition of Marine Corps Times next week, but I wanted to post one piece of news now: Marines who split off the amphibious assault ship Kearsarge in January to deploy to Afghanistan won’t likely be there much longer. In an exclusive phone interview, Mills said BLT 3/8 is “going to keep on their…

The Badda Skat Band is a 4 piece roots reggae band based in St. Petersburg, Florida, which debuted live in November of 2014. However, Badda Skat's journey in music began back in 2000 with a release of numerous tunes online. This eventually led to a collaboration between Jah Roots and Badda Skat which resulted in Badda's debut album GRASS ROOTS. This was later reproduced and remastered in the traditional "dub" format and released as GRASS DUBS. Both are currently available on all digital distribution outlets such as iTunes and Amazon, as well as online streaming outlets like Pandora and Spotify. Badda also recently released a completely self-produced EP entitled MI JACARANDA, which debuted in vinyl format.
More than just a band though, Badda and his team of musicians strive to promote a conscious message in all of the music they perform. Taking their positions with high responsibility, The Badda Skat Band use their original songs to deliver insightful and inspiring lyrics that will leave the audience cheering for more. Already writing and recording new material, the Badda Skat Band has released a brand new EP titled High Grade Reggae, which is available for FREE download via baddaskat.com. Gaining the interest of fans around the US and abroad, Badda Skat has enjoyed opening for various international acts such as Protoje, Kybaka Pyramid, Jesse Royal, Iba Mahr, Collie Buddz, Yellowman, The Original Wailers, Eek-a-Mouse, Black Uhuru, Morgan Heritage, Julian Marley, Gyptian, 311, Less Than Jake, and Matisyahu. Most recently, a nearly sold out crowd packed Jannus Live in St. Petersburg for a reggae show with 4 international headliners, for which The Badda Skat Band was scheduled to open. Unfortunately, the headliners were unable to perform due to travel issues, but The Badda Skat Band went on to play for over 90 minutes! People are still talking about their show saving performance!
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Legendary songwriter Tony joe White’s new blues-based album, Bad Mouthin’, arrives September 28, 2018, straight from the swamps with its blend of classics and five White originals, including two of the first songs he wrote — just before penning his breakthrough hits ‘Polk Salad Annie’ and ‘A Rainy Night in Georgia’ in 1967.
“When and where I grew up, blues was just about the only music I heard and truly loved,” says White, who’s 75 and, if anything, an even more visceral performer than in his youth. “I’ve always thought of myself as a blues musician, bottom line, because the blues is real, and I like to keep everything I do as real as it gets. So, I thought it was time to make a blues record that sounds the way I always loved the music.”
Over the course of Bad Mouthin’ ’s 12 songs, White conjures a world of meaning that transcends the lyrics of classics like Jimmy Reed’s “Big Boss Man,” Lightnin’ Hopkins’ “Awful Dreams,” and Charley Patton’s “Down the Dirt Road Blues,” using his deep river of a voice and the dark, spartan tones of his guitar to evoke the mystical South — a place where ghosts roam among abandoned pecan groves covered in Spanish moss and, indeed, the Devil might be encountered at a moonlit crossroads.
That White — who has written hits and cuts for a compendium of fellow legends from Elvis Presley(“Poke Salad Annie”) to Brook Benton (“A Rainy Night in Georgia”) to Dusty Springfield (“Willie and Laura Mae Jones”) to Eric Clapton (“Did Somebody Make a Fool Out of You”) to Tina Tuner(“Steamy Windows”) to Willie Nelson (“Problem Child”) to Kenny Chesney (also “Steamy Windows”) to Robert Cray (who recorded White’s “Don’t Steal My Love” and “Aspen, Colorado” just last year) — would now craft a blues album after more than 50 years spanning the rock, country, R&B, and Americana genres is an incredible testament to his versatility as well as to his roots.
Mostly, Bad Mouthin’ features White accompanied solely by his road-worn 1965 Fender Stratocaster, the guitar he’s favored for his entire career. That’s all he needs to conjure the same kind of simmering emotional magic that John Lee Hooker distilled into his historic solo recordings — just one man and one guitar essentially defining what it means to be human in a story as simple and yet as profound as a Zen koan.
Five Bad Mouthin’ stories, “Stockholm Blues,” “Rich Woman Blues,” “Cool Town Woman,” “Sundown Blues” and the title track, are plucked from his own past. In “Bad Mouthin’,” about an abusive lover, White’s voice rings with the weariness of a man pushed to his limits. And in “Sundown Blues,” his spare lyrics capture the essence of a lonely heart over a slow smoky shuffle reminiscent of Hooker’s famed lowdown boogie beat.
On both of those tunes — which are early, rediscovered compositions that White first recorded for a local label in Corpus Christi, Texas, in 1966 — and two others, drummer Bryan Owings backs White. Owings is White’s frequent accompanist on tour, in the two-man band format that White enjoys. Owings has also performed and recorded with Emmylou Harris, Justin Townes Earle, Wanda Jackson, and many others. Bassist Steve Forrest joins the duo on two numbers. The album was produced by Jody White and engineered by Ryan McFadden.
Their recording strategy was unconventional. White moved a hodgepodge of gear from his home to his barn, where two former horse stalls became their studio. “The cement-floor saddle room with unfinished wood paneling had a window unit air conditioning box that had to be turned off for recording,” says McFadden. “The next stall over had a dirt floor covered with glued composite board. Tony cancelled the first session, saying he couldn’t sing in there because of the chemical smell of the glue. When I went back, Tony had filled the stalls with bowls of coffee grounds, cups of rice, dryer sheets, and decorative brooms made of bound twigs that were drenched in a cinnamon scent, sold at grocery stores around Halloween.” After that, each song was cut live in one or two takes. The approach perfectly captured the laidback open sound and sliding chords with thumb-plucked low-string lines that defines White’s blues-drenched guitar style. Since White plays good and loud, they put his 1951 Fender Deluxe amplifier in the back of his Land Rover, so its bawling tones wouldn’t interfere with the vocals and percussion tracks.
White, who was born in 1943 as the youngest of seven children on a cotton farm about 20 miles from the nearest town, Oak Grove, Louisiana, says the foundation of his music “comes from hearing blues singers play guitar with maybe just a harmonica or stomping their feet for accompaniment.” Adding a drummer, he cut his teeth playing school dances and then moved on to nightclubs along the Texas and Louisiana “crawfish circuit” of rough and tumble watering holes. And then the hits started happening, with “Polk Salad Annie” reaching number eight on the pop charts in 1968. Two years later, Brook Benton’s recording of “A Rainy Night in Georgia” topped the soul charts, and it’s been a wild ride since: decades of touring and recording marked by hit songs and collaborations with the likes of Eric Clapton, Jerry Lee Lewis and Mark Knopfler.
“If there’s anything like a line connecting everything that I’ve done, I would say it’s realness,” says White. “Even my songs that are sweet little love ballads —those are all real, inspired by real love and real life. Being real, being focused on what’s really going on around you, is something I learned early in my life.”
He pauses and laughs. “When you’re a little kid growing up down in the swamps, and you step on a cottonmouth … that’s real.”

Ascend the slopes of Mount Batur under a star-lit sky to watch the sunrise over the island and volcanoes. The 2-hour uphill trek is challenging, but it pays off with spectacular views of lava flows, Lake Batur, Mount Abang, and Mount Agung. After the hike, refuel with lunch and relax in hot springs.
After pickup at your hotel early in the morning, take a 90-minute drive to the base of Mount Batur. Here, local guides welcome you and provide a complete safety briefing and a flashlight. The first section of your hike is through plenty of volcanic ash, sand, and small rocks. The path is mostly uphill but you have several chances to stop and rest.
After 2 hours and 1.2 miles (2 km) of climbing, approach the top of the crater, a wind-swept area with very few rocks and vegetation. At the top—5,633 feet (1,717 m)—watch the long-awaited sunrise over Mount Abang and Mount Agung. On clear days, you may see Lombok's Mount Rinjani in the distance. As you admire the stunning view, enjoy a simple breakfast with hot coffee or tea.
Continue on foot to another crater rim and descend along the same path you climbed in the dark. Admire spectacular views of the surrounding landscape like lava flows from recent eruptions and their path of destruction as well as Lake Batur in the distance. Upon reaching the mountain's base, enjoy time to bathe in hot springs and have lunch before your ride back to your hotel.

An all-terrain vehicle (ATV), also known as a quad, quad bike, three-wheeler, four-wheeler, or quadricycle is a vehicle that travels on low-pressure tires, with a seat that is straddled by the operator, along with handlebars or steering control. The rider sits on and operates these vehicles like a motorcycle, but the extra wheels give more stability at slower speeds. Agro Puncak Bukit Catu provides two types of course across their lush panoramic area; long and short.

Another awesome senior model session!! Soooo Olivia is great to work with. We love playing around with new ideas so her final mini session as my senior model gave us the opportunity to experiment! So sad that the class of 2017 senior model program is drawing to a close :( But very excited to start meeting and working with my class of 2018 girls! The best part about the senior model program is having so many opportunities to experiment and play with fun new looks and cool ideas. Because you get 3 individual sessions, there are so many things we can do! For this session with Olivia, we shot in my new studio and had some fun playing around with some colored lights and white lights. It's such a blast to be able to have fun and unique photos, rather than something traditional! The senior models are always encouraged to share their ideas, no matter how weird you think they are, and we incorporate what you want into your photos! So if you have some fun, funky, and out of the box ideas, don't be afraid to tell me, I won't think it's strange! If you're currently a junior and think that a unique and different photo session sounds awesome to you, then click here to join the class of 2018 senior model program!

As reported here, Google has heroically been trying to negotiate the rights to scan and make available "millions of out-of-print books." I.e., to solve a problem caused by the state's copyright law. But the "$125 million agreement between Google and U.S. authors and publishers is being renegotiated," because "the U.S. government said it seemed the agreement would violate antitrust laws." In other words, if you try to work around one state-granted monopoly (copyright), they'll stop you by accusing you of violating state anti-monopoly law. Unbelievable.

Watched Fanboys tonight. Loved it. I’m a fairly serious Star Wars geek fan and I know no one like this. Is it sad that I wish I had someone to argue with about the finer points of Star Wars and sibling kissing with? Yes? Ok…well…that’s cool :)
Seth Rogan played a trekker (and a pimp!). Hysterical. Practically unrecognizable but his voice is a giveaway. But he called Han Solo a bitch – he needs to go down!
I think it was best to not watch this movie with my husband. He would be afraid that I would know ALL of these references :) (he gets afraid when we watch Big Bang Theory and I know all of those references.) And only as strong as the weakest link? Wookie home planet = Kashyyyk… simple. A baby question…
The memorabilia room that we all dream exists…Steve Sansweet knows it does…(excellent on a Ray Parks/Darth Maul cameo there!)
Fun movie. I liked it. Star Wars fan? Watch it. You do not have to be a crazed fan. Just like Star Wars and you will laugh. And the crawl…Who remembers how they felt in the Episode 1 crawl? After waiting how many years?? Do not care how you felt about the movie – the actual experience of seeing that movie – awesome :) I waited hours in that line and do not regret it. Not one minute. Ever.

Showing that she’s still ‘the Don’, La Bella Dona sent out supermodel beauties in trailing, frayed, new-age festival-inspired dresses that smacked of a new dawn, new Don at Atelier Versace.
We know that Signora Versace is capable of breaking the rules. She was the first designer to star in another designer’s ad campaign when she fronted the Givenchy AW’15 campaign, proving like Madonna, she does what the hell she likes. When she took over the house after the passing of the late Gianni Versace, few could imagine that Donatella would pave the way in her own manner while honouring and staying true to the heritage and history of the late Gianni.
This Fall 2015 couture, Atelier Versace has veered left and strayed to the frayed and narrow. Unfinished hems, trailing languid columns, billowing shifts, sheer panels with floral motifs, the vibe all mirrored by the simple New Age garlands worn in the hair by beauties such as Lara Stone and Kendall Jenner, showed a new look at couture.
This was not strict, nor trussed, nor too embellished but a mix of sexy frayed chiffon, lace, devore velvet and Swarovski studded edges. It seemed like a relaxed air was taking place during festival season, not usually echoed in couture, the juxtaposition of all that’s not down-and-dirty. Perhaps Donatella is ahead of her game that her red-carpet, fashion soiree gowns are worn by types who wander the Globe and are as easy and at home in Glastonbury or Cannes or Hollywood for that matter.
There’s still hugely sexy gowns in the mix that spell power-lust rather than fairy-dust but the Festival Meets Midsummer Nights Dream feel of this couture collection seemed to hit the mark.

May is my favorite month. I 'm a Taurus and proud of it. I'm so Taurus- five planets in Taurus. To many, that might mean I'm stubborn. I like to think of myself as cautious or slow to change. I can and do change. Recently, I have had a major change of heart about Indian food. I had some unpleasant Indian food experiences when I was young and decided I did not like the spices. Well in the last 3 months, I have done a one eighty and now I am loving Indian food. I mentioned Chana Masala ( Chickpea stew) in my last entry. Tonight I finally made a fantastic mango lassi ( yogurt drink) after three attempts . Mango lassi is a nice love drink. Made with fresh mango & cardamon, I added a dash of Vanilla extract. I also used the plain lassi (base drink) from Trader Joes. Add some sugar and blend for 30 seconds. My next step is going to making homemade chutneys. After years- no make that decades of fearing the idea of gardening, have finally started a tiny herb garden. I 'm always buying basil and it is time for me to grow my own.
After seeing the Korean film POETRY last month ( twice), I started thinking about writing poetry again. A week later I saw a notice at one of the libraries in my area for a poetry slam. In my personal life, I'm dealing with a few people with whom I'm having serious communication problems. I guess I could write yet another letter to the Universe and offer it up as a prayer. Since my art comes from my life and personal experiences, I decided that I was going to write poems instead. I also wrote a poem about my relationship with sugar ( a very dysfunctional one). The event was video taped and is on the internet so there is no point in me hiding what I wrote. My purpose for attending and participating in the poetry slam was to speak my truth out loud and release the pent- up feelings that have festered because I cannot communicate with certain people. I look at the poetry reading as public purging of my personal demons. This is my personal journey with Pluto at the moment. It is all about communication; writing and speaking my truth as a way to step into the light from the darkness. More therapy- awesome! The healing journey continues. Therapy and I get fame too. Definitely a win-win situation ( ha,ha).
It is obvious that I love films ( movies). I like to think it may be for this secret I 'm about to reveal ( although I don't think there really is a correlation) . My paternal grandmother ( whom I named after and died of breast cancer two years before I was born), had someone who was madly in love with her and wanted to marry her. The person was Louis B. Mayer ( before he moved out to California). My grandmother didn't marry him but married my grandfather instead. My grandfather was a French and Spanish teacher at Dewitt Clinton High School in the Bronx. When he passed away in 1974 from a brain tumor, they dedicated a wing of the school in his name. I interacted with my grandfather a few times when I was young. In my opinion, he resembled Louis B. Mayer. Interesting. Speaking of the film industry, I loved the HBO documentary HIS WAY about legendary film producer Jerry Weintraub. The best part of the documentary was the shocking twist about his love life. Mr. Weintraub is a great salesman but his greatest score is definitely his love life. He may be the envy of most men in America. After seeing the documentary I ran to google Mr. Weintraub and find out his astrological sign. He's a Libra so he is naturally very charming and graceful. Libra, an air sign have the gift of gab.

Flexibility lifts robot efficiency in pasture-based dairy fams - Magazine - Farm Business - General - The Australian Dairyfarmer
Nick Dornauf has found a flexible approach to using robotic milking has better suited his farm operation.
A flexible approach to robotic milking in pasture-based systems could offer dairy businesses opportunities to improve labour efficiency, reduce the need for on-call staff and improve energy efficiency at certain times of the year.
FutureDairy project leader, Associate Professor Kendra Kerrisk, said results from a preliminary study indicated experienced cows could be transitioned from voluntary milking to semi-batch milking and back to voluntary without a negative impact on milking frequency or milk yield.
"A semi-batch milking approach at certain times of the year would appeal to some farmers with automatic milking systems (AMS), particularly those with seasonal or split calving systems," she said.
"In the past, we've tended to think AMS farms should be operated with either voluntary or batch milking and that swapping between the two would be difficult."
With voluntary milking, cows move around the farm by themselves: from the paddock to the dairy and on to the next feed allocation. The aim is to achieve a relatively steady flow of cows being milked throughout the day and night to maximise the utilisation of the robots.
With semi-batch milking, cows are generally held in a paddock and the gate opened at specific times for cows to move to the feedpad and then the dairy for designated milking sessions by the robots.
"Voluntary cow movement presents some challenges with seasonal or split-calving herds because there are times of the year when the number of cows per robot is relatively low," she said.
The challenges include difficulty maintaining voluntary cow flow (and the need to fetch more cows), reduced labour efficiency, higher power consumption per litre of milk harvested, managing small pasture allocations and the potential for milk quality issues in warm weather due to intermittent fresh milk flushing through the plant.
Some of these challenges can be addressed by deactivating some of the AMS box units or bails in the case of the automatic milking rotary (AMR). An alternative is operating with voluntary cow movement for most of the year, and switching to semi-batch milking in the months that the milking herd is significantly reduced. Semi-batch milking has the added advantage of avoiding the need for on-call staff during the night hours.
"Our concern was that the cows may struggle to shift from semi-batch milking back into voluntary movement when the herd size increased again," Assoc Prof Kerrisk said.
"We know from previous research that cows require a training and adjustment period when they are first introduced to an AMS with voluntary cow movement. We didn't know whether or not AMS-trained cows would be able to switch between semi-batch and voluntary movement."
In 2015 and 2016, the AMS at Gala Farm, run by Nick Dornauf and his partner Rebekah Tyler, in northern Tasmania operated with semi-batch milking for about eight weeks. With a split-calving system, there is typically a period of low milking numbers in the winter months when the milking herd drops down to 200 cows (from 600 cows at peak).
The software that runs the AMS collects detailed records on individual cows, allowing the FutureDairy PhD student Juan Molfino to analyse the impact of semi-batch milking at Gala Farm in 2016. In particular, he compared milking frequency, milk yields and concentrate consumption ù before, during and after the semi-batch milking period.
Mr Molfino said that results showed the effects of semi-batch milking on milking frequency were temporary with the cows smoothly adjusting back to voluntary milking (see Table 1).
"We created a model using the Gala herd data to analyse what happened to milk production," Mr Molfino said. "During the period of semi-batch milking, milking frequency and milk yield dropped slightly, which was to be expected as their access to the dairy was restricted during the weeks of semi-batch milking."
Mr Molfino said he was surprised when the herd reverted from semi-batch milking to voluntary that milking frequency and milk yield not only recovered but exceeded the levels in the original voluntary milking period.
"Our analysis accounted for stage of lactation and excluded freshly calved cows so the change in milking frequency and yield may have been associated with the spring flush in pasture quality and quantity," he said.
The increase in concentrate consumption (from 8.39 kilograms/cow/day to 8.61kg/cow/day during semi-batch milking) was also unexpected.
"It's possible the semi-batch milking resulted in cows accessing the feed stations in a more hierarchical order, which may have reduced the likelihood of more dominating cows preventing access to concentrate by less dominant cows," he said.
When the herd went back to voluntary movement, concentrate consumption dropped to 8.52 kg/cow/day, which was slightly higher than before the switch to semi-batch.
Although it was only a preliminary study, the results have given the FutureDairy team confidence that semi-batch milking for certain times of the year is a feasible management option for AMS pasture-based farms. And the benefits at Gala Farm were positive enough for semi-batch milking to become routine practice every year from mid-June to mid-August.
The semi-batch milking approach has been pioneered at Gala Farm in Tasmania where the Dornauf family milk up to 600 cows in a DeLaval Automatic Milking Rotary (AMR). Although calving is split between autumn and spring, the herd size drops back to about 200 in the winter months.
Nick Dornauf said 2017 would be the third year the herd would be semi-batch milked between mid-June and mid-August.
"It works really well for us," he said. "The main reason we tried it was to overcome poor voluntary cow movement at a time when the cows receive most of their feed at the dairy ù either concentrates or hay/silage at the feedpad. But there are many other benefits, including less pugging damage because the cows spend less time in the paddock and more time at the feedpad, a drop in power consumption and a better match with staff availability."
The semi-batch system at Gala involves the automatic gates opening 2.5 hours before the start of each milking session.
"The cows walk to the dairy at their own pace and have access to the feedpad before milking," Mr Dornauf said.
Unlike box AMS units, the AMR can be used with human cup attachment. "At this time of the year with fewer cows it's faster to turn off the robots and attach the cups ourselves," he said. "Most staff are on leave and there's minimal other work to be done on the farm so it's actually more convenient to milk twice a day.
"Milking in two, concentrated sessions a day means the dairy isn't running 24/7 for these months. This gives staff a break from being on call at night and on weekends.
"Another bonus is our power bill drops by 40 per cent during these months. And it creates a really good opportunity for scheduled maintenance by our local dealer or for us to train heifers. The rest of the year, when the robots are running 24/7 it's awkward to have downtime for maintenance and heifer training."
But the big question is how well do the cows cope with going back to voluntary milking when the milking numbers increase with spring calvers?
"We were a bit concerned about that before we tried semi-batch milking," he said. "But it turned out to be a non-issue. In fact, the cows tell me when it's time to revert to voluntary cow movement. We see signs in the cow behaviour that they want to return to the dairy sooner than we are scheduling. It's a combination of increased pasture in the diet and the number of fresh cows."

The box of MJX bugs 3 quadcopter also reveals there are a number of additional components that you could buy to boost this drone in whatever you want, from FPV speed to an excellent digital camera drone.
The fantastic news is that you could also get yourself a really excellent yet cheap 4k action camera for it. If you want to discover the lowest costed prices for your action camera, you can set up our Free Firefox growth that may help you find the cheapest priced technical gadgets like drones and action cams by evaluating the outcomes of sites. The dimension the MJX bugs 3 quadcopters is 31 cm from the motor to engine (and over 40 cm from brace to prop), that makes it mid-sized. It also has a port for an actions digital camera that can match GoPro idol 3 and idol 4, however, not the new hero5.Seeing that also described in it clips, I am fairly satisfied with the standard structure of RTF RC quadcopter itself. The nasty it really is made from seems high best quality and it works together with damage pretty well from my experience.?
Does not have elevation maintain or headless setting/one key come back. I consider a plus Exceptional and maneuverable brochure at the high quantity. Yet nice and continuous at low quantity for antenna movie reasons.Excellent promoted range at 300 to 500 meters. However, in this film, I limited the number that I was planning a trip to simply over 200 meters, as this dark quadcopter gets hard to find at that range.Provides telemetry caution beeps of low battery or when vacationing near RTF RC quadcopter’s range limit.
Includes a camera of RTF RC quadcopter install that accommodates most GoPro design action cameras such as for example Xiaomi Yi and also the larger SJCAMs.
Not for starters. Needs information traveling, is to keep alignment (all black), and doesn’t have elevation maintain. And generally, brushless motor quadcopters are simply not secure in the hands of a fresh brochure. You really should end up being experienced in this skill before taking into consideration this quadcopter.
The 7.4V 1800mah share battery is somewhat exclusive. Generally, it includes a case around it to correctly fit it into battery bay. Yet much huge 7.4v batteries will also match this electric battery power section, and will be used when you can your internet site XT30 battery get connected to connect to RTF RC quadcopter. Also, recommend some froth to make certain that they fit well.
I had to land much sooner than the promoted 19 a few minutes flight time at 8 a few minutes 42 seconds because of low battery telemetry aware. The battery still had 7.57V keeping potential calculated after obtaining. Also to be reasonable, battery power was not yet programmed, and it was raising the excess weight of a SJCAM while being strongly traveled.

there is also something called next door millionaire - typically defined as someone very low key - appears to be a minimalist but in reality have racked millions of dollars of savings and investments. maybe thats you One world.
But I agree with your observation of having a decent job in USA for over 2 decades, one can with right savings/investment strategy can accumulate significant amount of money and lead the rest of life with financial independence.
I hate those definition of middle class where a number is used. It really depends on location and certain middle class squeeze that one feel. And that is the reason Federal tax brackets are not fair to big portion of population. Democrats always define ppl with household income >200k as rich and always go after that group. And then they talk about taxing ppls 401k. this that. Almost punishing ppl who worked hard their whole life.

La Regione Lombardia approva in consiglio la nuova legge sullo smaltimento dell’amianto, ma i fondi non ci sono
Hello everyone! Sorry I have been absent for such a long time, but I was busy studying and stuff like that.
Two weeks ago - or more, I can't remember actually - I started watching Green Gables Fables. Before this I also watched the Lizzie Bennet diaries, but I stopped, because it wasn't much fun, for me. I don't know, maybe because they where all wearing far to much make-up? (They did)
But Green Gables Fables is amazing! I loved it from the very first episode till the last, and I am so sad it ended so soon. There should have been a season three.
Anne is really very much like Anne would be if she had lived now. I think they did an amazing job on that. She is very enthusiastic, I love her hair (mine is actually that length, so that's one other reason why I like her so much. :P (except mine is not the same colour)) and how she dresses, her personality and how she grows throughout the series. And she is funny.
Diana is also great. She is very sweet, and caring. And sensible, wich is good. Especially with a friend like Anne, who can sometimes be dreaming away. :)
I absolutely love this picture. (that's Gilbert in the middle, and I like the person they picked for his role very much too. He's like Gilbert as I imagined him living in this era (is 'era' even a right word for these times?))
There are other characters, like Matthew, who I don't really like because no one can be any better than Matthew from the movie, like EVER, but he's okay.
Then there's Fred, and Josie, and Jane (who is a really fun person because she is so serious!) and Ruby,
who has to leave the series for a very terrible reason. I am not quite over that yet. It was very very sad.
Also, I have been reading a Dutch book about the sea and great characters, and it's set in 1900. Anything that has history mixed with the sea, is my jam. I love the sea, and I love history. To be precise, I like the things they did then, and how they dressed, what their customs where, rather than facts like dates and famous persons.
At first I had no idea what this bird was called in English, so I checked it on Google translate. It's a heron. He is very common in Holland.
Alas, the frost has dissapeared now, and we have to content ourselves with fog and cloudy skies. But that's beautiful too, so I have nothing to complain!
Well, that's it for now. Nothing interesting has happened, unless studying is interesting (wich it is, but not really... right?).
Welcome to my blog, I'm Rebekka, an eighteen year old girl who loves books, writing, watching Period Drama 's and other movies and playing the piano so now and then. I'm Dutch, the eldest of seven, all homeschooled, and here I write about Period Drama's, books and writing, and occasionally a little about life. Hope you enjoy your time around here!

Hello everyone! Since fall is nearly there, I thought I might make a to-do list. Real fun, because I looove making lists. I am just not very...

If brands and agencies are an intrinsic part of the societies from which they emerge, they should be supporting those societies through thick and thin
'We are not in politics, we are in business’ is a quote I once read or heard. It made an impression, not only because it attempted to negate all moral responsibility, but because it made it easier to countenance the crossing of ethical boundaries.
Some brands and agencies have no qualms about who they do business with or whether they support minority rights or not. Money is money. Business is business. But in a world where brands and agencies claim to be more attuned to society; when they champion social causes; when they attempt to create movements for good; when they talk about corporate social responsibility and business being about more than the bottom line, why do they continue to make what could be viewed as ethically questionable decisions?
Should agencies work for governments that do not hold full legitimacy? Should brands refuse to operate in territories where human rights are suppressed? Should they support equal rights and the freedom of expression and assembly? Or should they just keep their mouths shut? Most seem to favour the latter, particularly in the Middle East.
Yet this flies in the face of current consumer demands for transparency and social responsibility, with brands standing accused of creating a culture of materialistic excess and over consumption, whilst simultaneously marketing themselves as virtuous, even as they ignore issues of inequality, wellbeing and global concerns over the environment and health.
If companies are attempting to be genuinely corporately responsible and to reflect a growing movement towards honest and principled corporate behaviour and communication, how can they support something in a particular market where it is easy to do so, but not take a similar stance in a country where they will face a substantial backlash? Is it not obnoxious that companies choose to align themselves with a cause that no longer holds any controversy in a particular market? How many companies, for instance, openly boycott Israel at risk to their own bottom line? Hardly any. How many companies raise their heads above the parapet when it comes to gender equality in the Middle East? Google it and see if you can find any.
And who can blame them, you could say, when more than half of the Egyptian men questioned as part of the International Men and Gender Equality Survey agreed that “there are times when a woman deserves to be beaten”. And when only 31 per cent of Egyptian men agreed women should have the same rights to work outside the home as their husbands.
Essentially, men’s views of equality between the sexes are tragically out of sync with the hopes of young women. So isn’t it the role of the private sector – as much as it is the public sector – to combat those views?
If brands and agencies claim to be an intrinsic part of society, shouldn’t they be facing the issues of that society head on? No dilly-dallying, no pussyfooting, just standing up for what’s morally right.
What they should not be doing is attaching themselves to the coat-tails of a movement for financial gain. Such insincerity should be boycotted at all cost.

Changes to compost pickup to eliminate “resident-supplied containers” and require residents to buy City-approved carts at $49.70/cart (although compost bags and bundling of materials next to carts will still be allowed). A program to pick up old carts for reuse or recycle has been added. Also, changes to solid waste ordinances to allow placement of waste carts in front open space for some buildings.
Class C liquor licenses and redevelopment district liquor licenses. Several agenda items cover the awarding of the one available Class C liquor license (currently being fought over by Everyday Cook, the Golf Course, and apparently Sweetwaters). Also in the mix is the establishment of a liquor “redevelopment district” for the DDA which would give two more available licenses to businesses within the DDA boundaries.
Resolution to direct Planning Commission and Planning and Development Services Staff to develop an ordinance requiring petitioners to engage in additional citizen participation for planned projects, planned unit developments and conditional zoning early in these projects.
Resolution authorizing the Downtown Development Authority to design and construct an underground parking garage on the city-owned South Fifth Avenue (Library Lot) parking lot.
It should be noted that the regular collection will now end October 31 instead of November 30. A special one week additional collection is proposed after Thanksgiving.
Also the $50 cart is a special one time only, one per household, purchase. First, it requires a retailer to agree to buy the carts from the city and resell them at a very minimal mark-up. The only retailer identified is Downtown Home and Garden. Second it requires a special voucher from the city, one per household, to get a $20 discount. Lowes currently sell carts by the same manufacturer for $90. The $90, seems a more realistic future replacement cost.
The only logic in refusing to let citizens continue to use their own containers is to force those people who to do not want to continually buy the paper bags for the sole purpose of throwing them away to buy the carts.
Anyone know how big these carts are? they’d have to be big enough to make it worth buying – I can throw a lot of leaves over my neighbor’s fence for free after all. Plus there’s so many parks in town to dump yard waste at, they’re not just for used fridges and tires anymore.
Not everyone is going to be able to cart a 64-96 gallon cart home from Downtown Home and Gardens… hey, I got a pickup! Who wants to throw me 5 bucks a trip and I’ll pick them up for y’all? Capitalism + hippyism = money for me.
Ch. 26, Section 2:5 (2)(c)(i) indicates that grass clippings would be accepted in curbcarts for compostables. That’s a change that I’ve not heard mention of, and it could be significant in its impact on the practices of residents. I would have liked for this component at least to be presented to the Env. Comm.
The worker comp property claims chart shows that claims peaked in FY03 at $65,000+. Anyone know what year the policy was changed allowing drivers/collectors to not be required to work beyond the time it takes to finish their route each day (or is that only for RAA drivers?) I’m just wondering if that change might have been an unnoticed factor in the change in claims over time.
Alas! Thanks to Glenn for spotting the little item F2 at the bottom of the page. As he says in comment #1, these changes in regulations stop collection of compostables on October 31 (instead of the old date of December 1). A tiny little patch has been added for an extra week after Thanksgiving.
Some people find themselves putting leaves into bags or containers rather than into the street. Some streets (like W. Stadium) are not configured for leaves into the street. Or maybe some miss the regular street pickup date (it is now very tight). With our warmer, longer seasons, leaves don’t necessarily drop in October and much garden cleanup remains as well.
I will be writing to my council representatives to ask them to intercede to prevent this change in regulations so that our current service is maintained.

Thomas, I read your suggestion of composting yard waste in public parks as tongue-in-cheek, but honestly I don’t think it’s an awful idea to set aside limited areas in parks for exactly that. I’ve got a giant yellow wheelbarrow that I use almost exclusively for carting the snow out of my driveway and into the backyard. I’d like to extend its use to carting leaves over to the Water Works Park on 7th Street.
* could do that any day of the week I want. * would get to use my big-ass wheelbarrow. * wouldn’t create an unnecessary road hazard for cyclists. * could go get free compost in the spring.
However, I don’t see this happening. My understanding is that neighbors of Virginia Park successfully opposed putting community gardens in one area of that park (to replace those lost at the Zion Lutheran site) on the grounds that ‘gardens are ugly’. I would have to concede that a compost pile is not more attractive than a garden.
The program to pick up old cans from April 1 through April 7 is in DS-3, the request to spend 358,200 to purchase 6,000 96 gallon carts from Bell Equipment. The city did not get competitive bids on the carts, which is probably why 8 votes are needed for approval.
The city paid just under 40 per cart for the 96 gallon carts purchased in 2004 for the regular refuse collection. These new ones are about 60. I’m not sure why they have gone up so much unless it is the increase in petroleum prices.
The workers comp claims data is inconsistent with the workers comp costs charged to the solid waste fund. The solid waste fund got charged 46,908 in workers come in the year ended june 30, 2005. The next year it dropped to 43,788 and then went up to 48,272 in fiscal year 2007. The chart appears to be actual claims paid by the insurance co and the amount charged to the fund is probably the insurance premium but I would expect a sharp drop in claims to result in a reduced premium.
The chart also shows a sharp drop in liability claims starting in fye 05 but the audits show that insurance costs increased from 75,432 in 05 to 122,220 in 07.
This is just nuts! I can’t believe the city is actually condoning forcing people to purchase paper bags (or $50 for a giant plastic cart) instead of using existing containers that have no other purpose. This from the city that likes to pretend that it’s green. What hypocrisy.
So, after giving one of the more eloquent presentations I’ve seen at the City Council table against awarding the liquor license to the City for use at Leslie Park, CM Briere declared she would be voting for awarding it TO THE CITY, whuh? ... in order to be on the prevailing side … so that she would have the right to bring the vote for reconsideration next week.
This, after the motion to postpone failed on a 5-5 vote. [Easthope is absent tonight.] So the strategy appears to be to reconsider next week, and with Easthope’s vote, prevail on the vote.
Anyone know why (or by which ordinance) liquor licenses are not considered on a first come, first served basis? (I haven’t had time to drill down through the agenda link in search of it.)
They probably don’t know this, but they could, if they wished, get a small winemaking license, purchase wine in bulk, and bottle it on site. Now THAT I could help them with….
In other words, they could have their own private label for the price of a $100 wine filler and a SWM license. It’d only take a few months to get it together, and they’d only have to buy 50 or so gallons at a time. Some of the smaller MI winemakers would be happy to sell them the odd barrel.
Something extraordinary happened when Council considered Sabra’s resolution asking the planning folks to consider a draft ordinance on citizen participation. The “tectonic plates” on development have been shifting under us, and finally there was an earthquake.
The resolution, as introduced, only applied to situations where the developer wants some kind of exception to the existing zoning in the form of a Planned Unit Development, a Planned Project, or conditional zoning. The participation requirements would not have applied where someone has the right to build something under the existing zoning, or where Council is being asked to rezone some land without using these three special gimmicks.
Mayor pro tem Marcia Higgins offered an amendment to Sabra’s resolution, which was adopted, and which dramatically expanded the scope of the resolution. It struck out all the “resolved” clauses in the original resolution and inserted the following:
RESOLVED, that the Mayor and City Council hereby direct the Planning Commission to develop an ordinance requiring any development to engage in citizen participation early in the planning process and;
RESOLVED, that the Mayor and City Council hereby requests the City Administrator to direct the Planning and Development Staff to develop an internal process that will address the implementation of the early notification stage for our citizens and;
RESOLVED, that the Planning Commission will provide a recommended ordinance and the City Administrator will bring the implementation process to City Council by the first meeting in June, 2008.
Higgins (and others) expressed their displeasure at a variety of bad projects that had been constructed—including projects that the developer had a right to build under existing zoning. Higgins mentioned a McMansion in the Fifth Ward. So the resolution includes “any development”. Council members apparently felt that too many inappropriate projects had been built, and they were receiving too many complaints.
Sabra woke me up at midnight to tell me what had happened. She said that an ad hoc Council committee would probably be appointed to work with the Planning Commission.
This may mark the end of the pro-development era in Ann Arbor. Or more exactly, as Winston Churchill said after the defeat of the Afrika Korps in 1942: “Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.”
Thanks for the stirring language but this could have very bad results. I’ve been an advocate for citizen involvement up-front in the process for PD and similar projects and I think citizen input is always helpful to the developers, staff and public officials. But I have a feeling that this could backfire badly on Council. If Council creates an expectation with the public that complaints can derail projects that meet the ordinance, one of two things will happen. These projects will be approved, as they should be when they meet the ordinances, and the public will walk away fuming over unmet expectations. Or the decision-makers will reject these projects and the city will be sued (and likely lose, as they should) by developers irate when projects that meet the ordinances are rejected.
If Higgins and others don’t like the projects that are being built under the zoning ordinances, then change the ordinances. If she doesn’t want to see McMansions built, then change the ordinances to prohibit them. Developers build what the ordinances allow so if the city gets “bad projects”, the Council is ultimately responsible for this.
This seems like a huge cop-out by Councilmembers too lazy or incompetent to change the ordinances. I’m sure the development community would scream bloody murder over changes that would stop “bad projects” but at least they would know where the lines are drawn. The only thing that this approach Council is taking will accomplish is more ticked off residents and more lawsuits from the development community.
Higgins mentioned a McMansion in the Fifth Ward. So the resolution includes “any development”. . .This may mark the end of the pro-development era in Ann Arbor.
Good thing A2 has smart people working for it who will immediately grasp the implications of this and advise the Planning Commission and Council accordingly.
You want to enclose that rear porch on your house into a sunroom? Well, that used to be a building permit that probably turned around inside a week, but now it’s going to take you that long just to figure out how to get your hands on a list of everybody within 300 feet of your property. Then you have to make up notices, send them out, wait two weeks to ensure people have enough time to figure out what the notice is for and plan to meet with you, hold a meeting, draft up the results, draft responses, and give all that to the City.
The sheer effort of going through the motions is going to be enough to push individual homeowners out to the Townships, even though, 99% of the time, there won’t end up being any “participation” to report on.
Hi, Todd. Interesting thought regarding Everyday Cook bottling wine. Would that then allow them to pour other wineries’ wines, or just the ones that actually purchase and bottle.
I recorded the Council meeting and had a chance to watch the part dealing with Sabra’s resolution just now.
“Any development” is apparently a term of art. It doesn’t mean “any construction”. Instead, it means “anything that comes to Planning Commission and Council”. In particular, it includes projects that require site plans, which, according to staff, are about 70% of the projects that Commission and Council process.
So this new procedure, once it comes back to Council, will involve ordinance changes that don’t affect the ordinary small project.
I would really like to see “plain English” incorporated into city council resolutions;terms of art tend to confuse the layman who do not typically understand such language. Most of us are not so erudite and esoteric so as to compehend this bombastic sesquipedalianism.
“So this new procedure, once it comes back to Council, will involve ordinance changes that don’t affect the ordinary small project.”
This contradicts the sentence that proceeds it. Most site plans that go to the Planning Commission don’t involve “ordinance changes”. Those plans usually meet the zoning ordinance requirements and usually don’t require a change in zoning to proceed. So which is it? Are all projects going to have to go through this review? What meets the definition of “ordinary small project”?
I’m reading the “ordinance changes” in [21] as the enactment of this new procedure of neighbor notification as an ordiance. Otherwise put:
“So this new procedure, once it comes back to Council [for consideration to be enacted as an ordiance], will be an ordinance that does not affect the ordinary small project.”
Good catch, I should have read that more closely. My previous comments on the potential problems with this still stand.
Ordinance writing and council resolutions should not contain subjective and mushy language like ‘ordinary small projects’. Further I would say ‘any development’ means anything built. If council means for this to be anything else they should pass a resolution that says so. Leaving it to ‘a term of art’ is just another way to say ‘spin’. This should not be left without distinction if the council means otherwise. The biggest problem with our ordinances is the inability of those who have to interpret them to know precisely what is affected by the code, and what is exempt, because the language is not careful; despite the best intentions of the smart people that murph references. Will it ever be perfect? Of course not, but certainly we can ask that the council make some attempt at drawing the line of distinction, or have the staff hammer that out.
I must admit that I don’t know how an engaged councilperson can listen to another use the expression ‘any development’ and not have loud bells and whistles go off in their head. In this case they not only heard it, they voted on it.
Council deliberated on composting carts for a good while. So long that I’m not sure what the outcome on the main issue was … something like: people can keep their own containers, for now anyway.
But the possibility of having huge carts emptied by a hydraulic arm prompted an intense discussion of grass clippings.
Background: a couple of years ago, grass clippings were prohibited as material that could be set out for compostables collection. My recollection is that at the time the grass clipping prohibition was enacted, the focus was on encouraging the more environmentally sound practice of leaving grass clippings in situ on the lawn, and that only later did the rationale emerge that was based on the weight of the clippings as it relates to workers’ ability to lift containers.
In any case, both of these arguments against grass clippings were discussed by Council on Monday, because as a part of the new compost cart proposal, City staff were proposing that grass clippings now be allowed back into the compostable stream … because if they’re in a bin that’s going to be lifted by a hydraulic arm, weight’s not an issue, which would leave only the environmental argument.
This environmental argument was advanced by Leigh Greden in the form of an amendment that had the effect of maintaining the current ban. His specific comments addressed the point of illegal grass clippings appearing in the solid waste stream, arguing that getting used to mulching would require a certain amount of adjustment time. He also drew a huge laugh when describing how mulching works he paused for a beat and added, “or so my gardener tells me”. The laughing went on so long that Stephen Rapundalo had time to join the fun by administering a fake dope slap to Leigh.
Greden was supported in his amendment by Kunselman, who pointed out that chicken droppings were high in nitrogen, and that any nitrogen shortfall in the City’s mix of compost (on account of low amounts of green material like grass clippings) could be rectified by allowing backyard chickens.
Higgens wondered why it was okay to accept grass clippings into the compost mix from other municipalities, if we don’t accept it from our own city residents. Part of the benefit of that, according to Sue McCormick, is that those clippings help maintain the nitrogen balance in the mix.
When the amendment to maintain the ban on grass clippings narrowly passed, with Mayor Hieftje voting against it, Hieftje commented sarcastically that he guessed then that the City’s compost mix just wouldn’t have enough nitrogen. This, despite McCormick’s statement from the podium that when the City most recently measured nitrogen levels (with the ban in place for a couple of seasons), there was not a nitrogen deficit.
One of McCormick’s comments about the leaf collection program I found encouraging. As one of the negatives associated with untimely collection (due to early snow, for example) she included the fact that when leaves remain in the road they’re a hazard for cyclists. I was just happy that the impact on cyclists of leaves in the road is routinely considered as a part of the picture.
My interpretation of the composting cart issue was that McCormick realized things were not going well and consequently stated the department could not implement the plan by April 1, 2008 so a decision was not necessary at that meeting. A tactical retreat to allow her to regroup her arguments. Council removed the clause prohibiting citizens from using their own containers from the ordinance change so, at present, you can continue to use your own cans.
The pickup schedule issue, F-2 was not reviewed by Council, so it will become effective unless overturned in the future. That is, yard waste collection ends October 31 instead of November 30. There will be one additional collection after Thanksgiving if you can remember the day. This will clearly result in more leaves in the street since many are still on the trees at the end of October. I have a difficult time understanding why HD is encouraged by a reduction in leaf pick up from those people that are willing to use cans or bags.
I think the great debate over the grass clippings is a very good example of Ron Suarez’s comments that the city is spinning out of control. This is simply something that should be treated as an educational program not a heavy handed city ordinance. I personally do not send my grass clipping anywhere. Still, I am offended that a lawn maintenance service that might mow Mr Fraser’s lawn in the twp is welcome to dump his clippings at the compost center ($14/yd tip fee). I can buy Mr Fraser’s grass clippings from the compost center ($20/yd), yet as a city taxpayer I cannot legally have mine collected. As a practical matter anyone that wants to put grass clippings into a yard waste bag or for that matter a plastic bag in the regular trash container can do it. The idea of cart OK, bag no, is ridiculous.
G. Thompson wrote: “I have a difficult time understanding why HD is encouraged by a reduction in leaf pick up from those people that are willing to use cans or bags.”
I don’t think that inference is even remotely supported by what I wrote. My sentiments, put a different way: I was encouraged by the fact that Ms. McCormick mentioned the potential leaves-in-the-road hazard to cyclists, as one of many challenges to be considered when thinking about the leaf collection program. Ms. McCormick’s remarks were encouraging, because often it doesn’t even occur to people that leaves in the road are a potential hazard for cyclists. So I was glad about that. It makes me optimistic that we can eventually come up with a better idea for leaves in this city than sweeping them all into the streets.
I think what you might mean is that you don’t understand how I could be encouraged by this mention of cyclists, when McCormick’s proposed reduction in container options would, in fact, tend to increase the number of leaves put in the street as a part of the leaf collection program, which exacerbates the potential hazard to cyclists. Perhaps I’ll eventually take the cynic’s view that this is mere lip service, but for now I’m content to be optimistic.
That’s because, as a cyclist, I value more highly the mention of the leaves-in-the road hazard in the public record, than I am afraid of the incrementally more leaves that might be put into the street as a part of the leaf collection program if residents were not allowed to use whatever containers they like for regular compostables pickup.
I infer from this and previous comments that to whatever extent possible, you containerize your leaves for compostable pickup, thus reducing the number of leaves in the street as a part of the leaf collection program, thus reducing the potential hazard to cyclists. Thanks for that.
Sorry if my point was not clear. You missed the issue of the change in the collection regulations. McCormick proposes to eliminate all yard waste collection, bags, carts or containers in the month of November. During this period leaves would be the primary material collected. Consequently there will be more leaves in the street. This is not, as you imply, an issue of the choice of container.
Your second paragraph is close. I do not understand why you are encouraged by her words when her actions are opposite and detrimental.
I focussed my second set of remarks on the choice of container, because you seemed to want to discuss that specific issue … by claiming (erroneously), “... HD is encouraged by a reduction in leaf pick up from those people that are willing to use cans or bags.”
“I do not understand why you are encouraged by her words when her actions are opposite and detrimental.”
Because in this instance, I chose to focus on the positive (I don’t always), with the thought I could eventually leverage it in support of the idea that we can figure out something better to do with ALL our leaves than sweep them where I need to ride my bicycle.
I do not think you understand. Let me try one more time. In November 2007 leaves were collected in bags and containers. I compost most of mine in my yard, but there is always some over flow. In November 2008, unless Council acts, the only method of disposing of them will be to rake them into the street. Leaves that in the past were placed in some ‘package’ for collection will now go in the street.
I concur with your desire not to have leaves in the street. I do not see how eliminating all other means of disposal is a step in that direction. Ms McCormick states she is concerned about our safety while taking actions that jeopardize it. You may choose to be encouraged by her words but I am more concerned about her actions and the additional leaves.
I’ve already addressed the topic of grass clipping here, and what’s true of grass clippings is every bit as true of leaves. If you have any doubts just let Sparty straighten you out.
The city shouldn’t be in the business of hauling anyone’s clippings and leaves anywhere. Coddling ignorant people may be the Ann Arbor way, but it’s stupid.
I mean, I know I came in the in the midst of a conversation, but I’m commenting on the larger issue.
So my main point is that if you eliminate clippings and leaves, you eliminate much of the need for containers of any sort. Speaking personally (and I fear smugly) I haven’t put out anything but bundles of wood (twigs, branches, and stumps) in years, but I also have sweet as hell, double-wide, compost bins for every other scrap of compostable material I can produce or procure from my neighbors.
And wandering off topic now, did you know you can get as many bags of rabbit shit as you want, for free, in Plymouth? Every time I pass through I fill up my trunk.
HD: I appreciate your recap of the council conversation about grass clippings, etc. (It went on too long!) I think you might have missed the point of what Higgins and the Mayor were saying. It goes back to the last time this came up and the fact the city is accepting grass clippings from the townships and as McCormick said, that is what is keeping the nitrogen at an acceptable level in the compost. Higgins said back then, “why would the city offer a service to the townships that city residents don’t receive?”
The mayor then said he did not want staff people having to paw through the bags and cans looking for the illegal grass clippings… I thought this was the root of his remark about nitrogen, that there would be less of it. Besides, what are they going to do, pour out the grass clippings?
I’m not sure what you’re trying to persuade me of. But I’m pretty sure the likes of me is not worth additional effort on your part.
The rabbit shit flyer says it’s already bagged. How well is it bagged? Otherwise put, what does your car smell like? Could the case be made that people with sensitive noses might want to opt for some sort of alternate transport besides a personal car for this stuff? And how big are the bags? What are the bags made of? Are there ‘pellets’ still discernable in the mix or is it just a uniform mixture?
The shit is bagged in various ways, some more securely than others. Most of it is in what I would call kitchen-sized white plastic bags—the kind with drawstrings. Some is in larger, hefty style, black plastic bags. And some is is oddball, recycled, rabbit food or bedding bags. The last group feel the least secure.
The nice thing about rabbit shit is that it doesn’t smell a great deal different from rabbit food, that is, it kind of smells like alfalfa pellets. What smells a bit is the urine, which has an ammonia tang to it.
Also, the shit is combined with the rabbit bedding, so you’re getting a shit, piss, and straw (sometimes sawdust) mixture, which to me is a bonus because there’s more bulk for the compost pile and you’re getting a somewhat balanced mix of both greens and browns combined.
Some of the bags are light and dry feeling, and some are really heavy and leaky. I think it depends on whether they’ve been out in the rain. They stash them under a lean-too behind their building, but it’s not weather proof, and they don’t seem to rotate their stock, so depending on when you go and where in the pile you grab, some of them may have been there for a while.
But yeah, I just look for dry ones and put them in the hatchback of my car. There’s a little straw/shit mixture that leaks out, but I can take the hatchback floor covering carpet out and shake it off. No harm, and no lingering smell that I notice. Mrs Structure-Dude! even accompanied me on one of these pickups and her comment was that the whole process was way less disgusting than she had imagined.
And believe it or not, I’m kind of fussy and a bit of a clean freak, so the only part of the process that grosses me out is that there’s nowhere to wash my hands after loading the car. If they had a setup like the Bush’s bottle return area, with a little sink and some soap, that would be perfect.
And finally, because the shit is out back of the rescue shelter, you can pick it up any time, day or night. I don’t know why but I actually prefer to scavenge rabbit shit when no one’s watching.
Thanks for the details. But I was hoping you’d say that the rabbit shit really stinks and that Mrs. Structure Dude complains all the time about the stink in the car and that you wished you had some other way to get the rabbit shit home.
My sense is that you’d also prefer to scavenge rabbit shit yourself, whenever you happen to be in Plymouth, as opposed to paying somebody to make the trip for you. But let’s say you determined that your compost pile needed a good dose of the rabbit shit and you didn’t foresee a trip to Plymouth in the near future. Is that something you’d be willing to pay money for (the service of having rabbit shit delivered to your door), or are you so used to the idea of free shit that you’d chafe at the idea of paying for it?
Reason I’m asking is that I’ve got a bicycle cargo trailer that probably needs to get more use than it’s currently getting, in order to justify the embedded energy in the manufacture of the thing.
But yeah, you guessed right. My Mom lives in Northville, so I’m over that way often enough to satiate my jones for a high nitrogen compost boost.
By the way, that’s a long way to Plymouth. I did that ride once, with no trailer, and I was pretty beat. And the traffic on Plymouth road is no picnic.
Still, if you’re all fired up about the idea, you could maybe put up an advertising flier in the Food Coop. Or you could just pick up a load and swing by the farmers market to peddle it, offering to meet your customers at their houses later in the afternoon with however many bags they select. They could even tag the bags they like, so no one else could get them.
I do think you’re on to something though. There’s got to be a market in Ann Arbor for rabbit shit delivered via rickshaw. Of course they’re going to make fun of you mercilessly on AAIO.
Looks like the required yard waste container proposal is rearing its ugly head again. According to the Ann Arbor News, it’s on the City Council agenda for this Monday. So far, it appears that the only change is lowering the cost of the containers. What is it with this insistence on forcing people to buy a large plastic container when they already have smaller containers that have been repurposed? Isn’t the greener solution to keep using these old garbage cans that can no longer be used for garbage collection?

Take these roots and tack on innumerable prefixs and suffixes and voila - roll your own link to the flood tradition. But, having looked at some of them...the evidence seems compelling in some cases.
i'm definitely not a linguist either. i'm an accountant for a reason However, it has to be that some are related. i've read about some very interesting research by linguists 'searching' for Proto-Indo-European or Proto-Nostratic and other such 'mother tongues' It's shocking how many languages today have very similar sounding words for the same concepts.
Yes ... actually, floods. The first whopper followed the LGM meltdown at about 14,400bc. The second was post Younger Dryas, 9600bc.
1. Could you explain how the second (9600BC) flood fits geographically into the Neolithic habitations at Catal Hoyuk, Gobekli Tepe and other similar Near East sites? I think some of Gobekli Tepe dates to around 9,000 BC. So would they have been paddling? And how long would it take to dry it all out, bearing in mind that they didn't have hairdriers?
2. You seem pretty certain that the American flood stories were imported from Mongolia/Siberia. Yet FM mentioned that there had been some American floods too. So I was wondering how and why you are so certain.
Then click on Satem in the left hand nav (or here: http://www.danshort.com/ie/iesatem.htm) to see all Indo European languages that are related to Eastern Europe and South Asia.
The links didn't work for me. i'll try IE when i get home. i've seen several language trees, but i'm always interested in others since it is a very subjective science. Hopefully i can access your link later.
Something is wrong here. War, disease, death, destruction, hunger, filth, poverty, torture, crime, corruption, and the Ice Capades. Something is definitely wrong. This is not good work. If this is the best God can do, I am not impressed.
Alright, I was able to get in....after I edited your original link to the second one which had an extra ) which fouled it up. I've corrected your original post.
I grabbed the picture and hosted it on photobucket because no sooner had I done that than the site reported "not available" again. I suspect they are having bandwidth problems. Anyway, here's the second image.
Yup, i have one very similar if not the same inside the cover of a dictionary. That dictionary, which i've had since high school, combined with J.R.R. Tolkien inspired my interest in languages.
The specific research i mentioned earlier was outlined in 'Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age' i know i've referred to that book here before, but it is one of my favorites. In the 'The Mother Tongue' chapter there is a short list of 'Proto-Indo-European' words with the equivalents from a dozen or so modern languages from around the world.
I think, once we understand just how many languages have an IE base, and how they all fit together, that the connection between the Siberians, the Indians and Orcadians begins to look not so unlikely.
I guess we'll have to ask the Out of Africa crowd what they spoke on the way from Africa to Northern India.
But I think just after the last ice age, which is what the Vedic stories are referring to, is about 20,000 years at least after HSS is supposed to have come out of Africa.
There's another gene study, I forget where I read it now, that follows HSS coming out of Africa somewhere around Ethiopia and crossing over into southern India. Some them stayed (thought to be today's Dravidians, Australoids etc, whose physiogony and language has some similarities with that of the Sumerians) and the rest carried on to Indonesia and all points east.
Here's a dumb blonde question - if we all came out of Africa, why is our skin not black? Skin pigmentation is due to genetics, so we wouldn't have gradually evolved fairer skins due to lack of sun rays on it ...well, not in such a short time anyway, imo.
That is not a dumb question by any means and is one of the main arguments that I can see for rejecting OOA. Something caused the different pigmentation but I doubt very much that it was the weather.
Black slaves who fled to Canada via the Underground Railroad remain black. Whites who moved to South Africa remain white. The only time we get any change is when there is a genetic mixture.
For that matter the Ancient Egyptians were white and the Ancient Nubians were black. I am not convinced that it was all that much warmer on the Nubian side of the border to account for the difference.
A change of colour is well within reason but one of the problems with the OOA scenario is that it is very difficult to explain how the colour cange spread through the population in the time allowed for by the later OOA scenario.
I can’t remember the last time I had such a negative physical reaction to a film. I’m going to have to start critiquing the film right away in what is usually an introductory paragraph because I have so many bad things to say about this movie. First off, let me make a disclaimer and say that I don’t usually like biopics. I especially don’t like biopics about musicians. Ray, Walk the Line; fine films, good acting, educational I guess, but just not something I’m overly interested in. So, going into Get on Up, I knew that it most likely wouldn’t be replacing any movie in my Top 20 any time soon. I was prepared for a story on James Brown’s idiosyncratic life, his flamboyant personality, his rise to fame against all odds, his unique style of music. But what I was not prepared for was the complete lack of professionalism in almost every aspect of the filmmaking process. It’s one thing to make a movie that won’t match some people’s exact tastes; it’s another to make what amounts to a training-video-caliber production that is one of the worst mainstream movies I have seen in quite some time.
James Brown, the Godfather of Soul, known as Little Junior in his youth. His early days weren’t easy, as he was an unwanted child, abandoned by his mother & then his father, left to live at a brothel and work to get lonely men in the door. Always musically inclined, Brown began singing & dancing in earnest, and while in prison for stealing a suit of clothes, met Bobby Byrd, the leader of a gospel band that James knew could be so much more. Taken in by Byrd and his family, Brown soon became the lead singer and the mastermind of the group, forcing it into the directional he wanted his own music to take and demanding that the public take notice. Slowly, James Brown as we know him was born, but not without casting aside friends along the way, making many mistakes, and becoming as infamous as he was well-known. A superstar had entered the business, changing the world of music with every beat, an original spirit whose equal would never be seen again.
The figure, the man, the antics; that’s interesting stuff. James Brown was such a wild force that couldn’t be contained, a game-changer in every way, someone who has influenced every album made in America since arriving on the scene. That impact is good reason to make a biography, and his story is told in full here. Chadwick Boseman plays him well, doing much of the singing & dancing himself, an impressive feat. But, and oh my god it’s a ‘but’, the movie is terrible, just the worst. The cinematography is like something from a 90s TV special, with camerawork that hurt my eyes & my taste level. The editing was horrendous, with choppy scenes and worthless dialogue that made the film entirely too long & unsupported. The side actors were atrocious, delivering lines with the talent of a 7-year-old. The musical scenes were too much in focus, making the film more of a concert documentary than a movie. It was like someone decided to put on a skit about James Brown for their college fraternity because they knew this guy who could do a mad split. Tate Taylor, director of The Help, was in way over his head, lost control, and ended up releasing a film that seemed straight from the cutting room floor; unpolished, unedited, shot while the actual cameras were out for repair and the actual actors were out to lunch. Get on Up is a disaster from start to finish, a film that had be cringing every few seconds. If not for the fascinating figure at the center of the story and the impressive performance by the man who played him, this might be Bottom 20 material.
Oh no, Netflix, what have you done. You made Josh Brolin look like a fool, you kept Danny McBride in the spotlight, and you cast some random kid with an accent because that’s supposed to be funny. That’s a whole lot of wrong right there, and I’m gonna need you to make up for it a different time, because you now owe us an apology.
A lost backpack caused police to close Sunset Boulevard for 4 hours during the November 18 morning rush.
The backpack, sitting on the pavement at a parking lot between Crescent Heights and Laurel Canyon boulevards, caused alarm as a “suspicious package,” Patch reports.
If a backpack in a parking lot can shut down Sunset for an entire morning, just think of what the Archer Expansion project is going to do.

Hurricane Florence lumbered ashore in North Carolina with howling 90 miles per hour winds and terrifying storm surge early Friday, ripping apart buildings and knocking out power to a half-million homes and businesses as it settled in for what could be a long and extraordinarily destructive drenching.
The Carolina coasts can expect winds topping 80 miles per hour late Thursday afternoon. Storm surge warnings, hurricane warnings, and tropical storm warnings are in effect along the coast of the Carolinas.
Nearly 160,000 customers already were without power in North Carolina Thursday evening - and that number is likely to rise.
As of 5 a.m. EDT it was centered about 205 miles (325 kilometers) east-southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and about 250 miles (450 kilometers) east-southeast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, moving northwest at 15 mph (24 kph).
While the storm's winds will abate as it moves inland, they could continue to gust to tropical-storm-force - especially near its core.
And now, many more people, houses and buildings are set to endure hurricane-force winds, which extend 80 miles out from the center of Florence.
As of 8 a.m., the hurricane is predicted to make landfall along the coast of the Carolinas tomorrow (Sept. 14), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Hurricane Center. Storm surge of 13 feet on top of a high tide at 7 feet could overwhelm Carolina Beach.
The result: catastrophic inland flooding that could swamp homes, businesses, farm fields and industrial sites. Ten million people are now under some kind of weather advisory.
Weather Underground meteorology director Jeff Masters said Florence eventually could strike as a Category 1 with winds less than 160 kmh, but that's still enough to cause at least US$1 billion in damage.
Its unclear exactly how many people fled, but more than 1.7 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were warned to clear out. Airlines cancelled almost 1000 flights and counting. Home Depot and Lowes activated emergency response centers to get generators, trash bags and bottled water to stores before and after the storm. The two hardware chains said they sent in a total of around 1100 trucks.
Duke Energy Co. said Florence could knock out electricity to three-quarters of its 4 million customers in the Carolinas, and outages could last for weeks.
Isaac Ginis, a hurricane expert at the University of Rhode Island's Graduate School of Oceanography, said that with rising temperatures, hurricanes are likely to become more intense, bring more rain and pose more risks to coastal areas from higher seas and bigger storm surges and waves.
Boarding up his home in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, Chris Pennington watched the forecasts and tried to decide when to leave.
It's also notable that there are three hurricanes, including Florence, lined up in the Atlantic at the same time.
About 10 million people could be affected by the storm and more than 1 million were ordered to evacuate the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia.
The US President tweeted: "Hurricane Florence may now be dipping a bit south and hitting a portion of the Great State of Georgia".
Marge Brown, 65, says goodbye to her father, George Brown, 90, before he is evacuated from a healthcare home in Morehead City, N.C., September 12, 2018, as Hurricane Florence approaches the east coast. Unsure of what they might find when they return home, the couple went shopping for a recreational vehicle.
He said if something catastrophic happens to his home, he plans to make his way to a neighbor's house.
He added that the two men were civilians, according the state-run Ria Novosti news agency and Russian Embassy in London . The attack left the Skripals hospitalized for weeks, and two other area residents became seriously ill months later.
These terms of endearment are all things Trump has said about the news media, most of which came out via his Twitter account. Amazon is designating 47,000 square feet of space at its new corporate office for a permanent Mary's Place shelter.
So, as Trump's tariff hikes on Chinese imports keep ramping up, China is naturally running out of room to retaliate. The timing and location of the proposed meeting were unclear, the sources familiar with the matter said.
A lot of people watch our games when we play Champions League and that's our job that we do the best we can do in all these games. The Belgian defender, who was expected to leave this summer, is back in the fold, but his current deal expires in 2020.
After landfall, the storm is expected to linger over the area for a few days, which would result in rising river levels and lakes. As of 5 a.m., Florence was 25 miles (55 kilometers) east of Wilmington, North Carolina .

Villavicencio, October 23 – The GGGI Colombia team under the framework of the sub-national strategy in green growth, and with the support of the Norwegian Embassy and Department of Meta’s Governor Office, carried out the second of four capacity building workshops on green growth for public and private stakeholders.
Around 90 participants attended the workshop, representing local communities, sub-national governments, the private sector, reforestation companies, investment funds and international cooperation institutions who received knowledge about the potentialities of the Meta and Orinoquia regions in green growth, and through a discussion panel they debated lessons learned from the experiences of investors in the forest sector.
With this workshop, Meta advances toward a forest culture while the participants learned about different forest projects where they can generate alliances, potential projects and exchange their knowledge.
The day ended with a fruitful meeting with the Business Association for the Development of the Orinoquia (ASORINOQUIA), who shared wide range of experiences with different activities such of cattle raising and forestry economies, while exploring the current challenges and opportunities of green growth.

It’s no secret that risk premia have taken wing in recent months, as our chart below illustrates. Nor is it any mystery as to the cause. Prices have slumped like a rock in a lake, and that’s boosted trailing yields and interest rates to the sky. What’s less obvious is if it’s time to avail oneself of the relatively rich offerings.
Alas, the answer to this perennial question is always debatable. Even in the best of times, the wisdom of investment decisions is always in doubt, albeit in varying degrees depending on the context du jour. But this is a major hazard only if you’re betting the farm on a given day or limiting your investment world to a narrowly defined subset of assets. Avoiding those dangers are essential for sound investing and sound sleeping, although it doesn’t allow us to completely sidestep uncomfortable choices or mistakes. Nonetheless, it’s a sound basis for putting our investing strategies on a sound foundation for improving the odds of long-term success. On that note, your editor is of a mind to begin indulging. In fact, we’ve been suggesting that in recent months and the advice stands anew. Not because we have a crystal ball. Indeed, the capital markets still face tough times, perhaps for an extended period.

The task of taking advantage of higher prospective returns must begin at some point. Waiting for the “all clear” bell looks great on paper, but in the real world market bottoms and tops are identified only in hindsight. By that time, a fair amount, perhaps most of the rebound is behind us. Yes, there’s always a good case for waiting, but there’s a risk in times like these that the waiting becomes habit. Patience is a virtue, but even virtuous behavior has limits.

In other words, we’re fans of holding a mix of stocks, bonds, commodities, REITs and cash and adjusting the mix based on current and expected conditions.
We don’t take this view lightly. Rather, ours is a perspective born after years of reading the financial literature, interviewing some of the world’s best strategists, crunching the numbers and analyzing real world results. In an effort to consolidate and categorize what this reporter has learned, we’re currently writing a book on the subject and will soon launch a newsletter dedicated to the topic (details to following in coming days and weeks). But for this post, the point is simply that winning the investment game requires action. Reasoned, well-timed, informed action, to be sure; but action just the same.
It’s tempting to think that we can put off crucial investment decisions until the buy and sell signals flash with unmistakable clarity. But the transparency arrives only in the rearview mirror, once we’ve sped past the opportunistic junction. In real time, the challenge of investing is working with an unknown future and wondering if our analysis today will prove worthy tomorrow.
There are several defensive tactics to employ to limit the associated risks without giving up too much of the prospective return. One is refraining from making bold changes to asset allocation in a short time period. Alternatively, one can and should practice an ongoing rebalancing/tactical asset allocation program. In addition, we should emphasize changing portfolios at times when conditions appear to favor our odds of enhancing future returns.
By that standard, 2008 has become an increasingly opportunistic year in terms of higher expected returns. That’s not to say that the trend won’t continue; if fact, we expect as much and so we must pace ourselves in terms of shifting assets into asset classes with better prospects while reducing allocations in those areas with declining expected returns.
Perhaps the crucial point is that dynamic asset allocation is a process rather than a one-time event. Time diversification, in sum, is crucial for strategic-minded investing. We can’t see peaks and troughs in markets in advance and so we should embrace apparent opportunities modestly, over time.
In essence, this is all about finding the optimal approach for exploiting the time-honored notion of buying low and selling high. As we discussed in 2006-2008, the extraordinary gains in everything was a signal to begin winding down risk exposures, albeit modestly, systematically and over time. We now encourage the flip side of that counsel.
Yes, we’re were early in recommending lowering risk levels in 2006-2008, and we’re likely to be early now in proposing that strategic-minded investors begin elevating their risk exposures. That’s the nature of contrarian-based investing, arguably the only prudent approach for long-run investment strategies.
No one said it would be easy; in fact, it’s downright awkward at times—like right now. So it goes in a world where mere mortals are faced with making imperfect decisions using limited information. As Winston Churchill might have said if he was an investment strategist in 2008: It’s the worst investment strategy available, except when compared to everything else.

Increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is required to support the high metabolic demands of cancer. Using an orthotopic murine model of glioblastoma (GBM) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastatic to the brain, we compared the relative activity of PPP vs. glycolysis in both tumors and their respective surrounding brains using [1,2-13C2]glucose. The ratio of [3-13C]lactate/[2,3-13C2]lactate ratio was similar between tumors and surrounding brains, suggesting that much of the lactate in both tumors exchanges slowly with glycolytic intermediates or that the flux into PPP increases in proportion to glycolysis.

Licentiate Thesis: Search for lensed supernovae behind the galaxy cluster Abell 1689 (12 December 2014)
Abstract : Distant supernovae probe the history of cosmic expansion and star formation, and provide important information on their progenitor models. Investigation of supernovae type Ia for z 1 are needed to reveal any evolution in their in- trinsic properties, and thus their utility as existing distance indicators. One approach to extend the redshift range beyond the reach of our telescopes is to use galaxy clusters as gravitational telescopes. Conversely, lensed supernovae can be used as probes for testing cluster lens model predictions. In this licentiate thesis, I present a 5-year ground based near-infrared search for gravitationally magni ed supernovae behind the galaxy cluster A1689. Abell 1689, at z=0.187, is a one of the best-studied clusters with an extended Einstein radius, making it particularly suited as a gravitational telescope. Our search resulted in the discovery of one highly magni ed supernova type II at z=1.703 and two transient objects (probably type IIP and Ia, in host galaxies at redshifts z = 0:94+0:07 􀀀0:27 and z = 1:030􀀀0:17 +0:20), which is in agreement with the survey expectations.

I probably won't be updating this blogspot page any longer (not that I've been doing it all that much lately), since I've squished blog/news roll functionality into my main site's home page. So go there for further updates and pictures and words and adventures!
I'm getting ready to post some new stuff, but in the meantime here is something old that hasn't been online in a while:
It is a painting of Ernest rupturing forth from the womb of the universe. It's very thick and texture-y, and after wrestling with some bad scans (too dark, too bright, too flat, etc.), I decided no image of it on the internet was better than a cruddy & misleading image of it. But in the last couple months I've been going through all my boxes of old sketches and material for a secret project and found this slide, which isn't perfect but gets the job done.
I kinda wish I'd saved the concept for a subject more (visually) interesting than Ernest. But this was like 2002, and I was still thinking mostly along the lines of forgotten '70s & '80s culture. You know, before Hot Topic made it impossible to forget anything.
This weekend I'll be at the Toronto Comic Arts Festival, headquartered with the rest of the Topatoco-affiliated people (I think my specific table is #228). The event is FREE but if you feel guilty about not spending any money I will have a portfolio of small and medium prints for sale as well as some Nic Cage sets and one or two or three Topatoco shirt designs.

A natural exfoliating fluid that purifies and smoothes the skin surface. Ideal for oily problem skin for facial care. In addition, may also be used as a rinse off peel in the shower to exfoliate and smooth dry flaky skin with excessive dead cells that accumulate on the surface.
­ Purifies, softens, smoothes and energizes the skin, whilst nourishing it from within and ridding it from its wastes.
Massage on the required area of the skin (keeping away from the eyes) for one to three minutes and rinse off with water.
Notes: 1. A slight tingling may be temporarily felt due to the high mineral content in the product. It will disappear upon rinsing.
3. In the salon, Salvital may be combined with other exfoliating products (Ananas Crystal Peeling or Bio Mineral Scrub) to be completely rinsed off and give a smoother peeling treatment.

Registration and payment are done online at the league website, aaybl.org. AARBL is STRICTLY a draft league, sanctioned by USSSA Baseball. The registration fee paid includes secondary USSSA insurance (personal insurance is primary), a cap, and a jersey. The league also provides catcher's equipment (excluding catcher's mitt), batting helmets, and GAME balls. All other uniform and equipment items are the player’s/team's responsibility. There is no player retention from season to season. Each season has a full draft of all paid registrants for that season. No complete teams are accepted into the league. ONLY TWO players are protected for each team in the draft, the head coach’s player and one assistant coach’s player. All paid registrations received prior to registrations being closed are GUARANTEED a spot on a team at the draft.
Our games are played at The Ed Mills Fields at Rotary Park, (formerly the South YMCA fields on Hillside), 4101 Hillside Road.
Leagues by age: 3-4 - Knee High (for all: MANDATORY t-ball 1st half of season, optional coach pitch 2nd half)
AARBL’s “league year” runs concurrently with the school year. Ages listed above are “LEAGUE AGES” and are based on a player’s age as of April 30 of a given year (see below) per USSSA guidelines. Players will play in the respective league based on “LEAGUE AGE”. Our “league year” consists of one fall season combined with the next spring season. The next 5 “league years” are as follows:
All players must have a copy of the original birth certificate or certified copy of the birth certificate on file before being allowed to participate in any league games. Once the birth certificate is on file with the league, that player does not have to provide another copy of the birth certificate in future seasons of participation in the league.
The player drafts are for COACHES ONLY. No players or parents attend the drafts. Players from the 3-4, 5-6, and 7-8 leagues will be drafted by those leagues’ coaches from a list of paid registrations. Players in the 9-10 and 11-13 leagues will participate in evaluations (tryouts) prior to the drafts. 9-10 and 11-13 coaches will attend these evaluations and take notes. 9-10 and 11-13 coaches will then draft their teams from their evaluation notes.
No teams in these leagues travel; therefore, no blackout dates or time slots are accepted for scheduling.
Please refer to the specific season policy for more information on dates, registration fees, scheduling information, etc.

FIDLAR brought their loud, SoCal skate punk sound to the Observatory North Park; never-ending moshpits ensued
FIDLAR kicked off the west coast leg of their fall North American tour on October 18th, 2018 here in San Diego at the Observatory North Park. Supporting the Los Angeles punk rock band on this leg were Toronto’s Dilly Dally and Southern California’s The Side Eyes. This would be my first time seeing FIDLAR live, and it absolutely exceeded my expectations.
The Side Eyes had already begun their set when I entered the venue around 8:00. If you consider yourself a punk purist and like the short, hard, and fast songs of the classic punk genre, this is the band for you. Their opening set wasn’t very long, but they managed to get through a surprisingly high number of songs in a short time. The in-your-face attitude of lead singer Astrid McDonald and the band’s energetic stage presence got the mosh pits circling early on in the night.
Dilly Dally was up next, and they offered something different from both The Side Eyes and FIDLAR. The four-piece from Toronto, Ontario (hello, fellow Canadians) have a slower, grungier vibe, and their sway-inducing songs were a pleasant break for us to recharge before the headliner. Their mellower sound didn’t put us to sleep by any means, as mosh pits were still going strong behind me throughout their set.
As Dilly Dally concluded and the stage setup for FIDLAR began to take shape (stacks of old televisions emblazoned with “FIDLAR” in red on their screens, a matching backdrop unveiled at the back of the stage), the crowd began to move in towards the barricade at the front of the stage. Eventually, I ended up dead center and in roughly the second row. I lightheartedly mentioned to my friend that if I had come to the show alone, I definitely wouldn’t be this close, lest I end up sandwiched between tall, sweaty dudes and unable to get out (or see anything). He responded that if that was the case, then I should probably just get out now because he wouldn’t be protecting me. Well, okay. I guess I was on my own. I had flashbacks to my near-death experience at the Frights’ show at the Observatory in August, and braced myself for an even rowdier crowd.
Shortly after, FIDLAR took the stage to an eruption of cheers. They launched right into “Alcohol”, released earlier this year, which sent the crowd into a frenzy. An absolutely perfect opener, with vocalist Zac Carper’s angry, screaming delivery; the unapologetic, “fuck it” attitude of the verses (“And I feel okay and get the fuck out my way/And did you think I wanna hear what you have to say?”), and the eardrum-blasting chorus. I managed to hold my own in the crush of already-sweaty fans, jumping along with them and periodically extracting my ponytail from getting pinched between shoulders. “No Waves,” a track off the band’s self-titled debut record, was met with an even greater energetic response. I stayed up front for the next two songs before heading back into the actual mosh pit. Being squished in the front is fun for a little while, but I think FIDLAR’s music is best experienced with the ability to jump around and push people.
About halfway through the set, Zac calmed us down for a moment to address something he had been noticing at shows: “sexual harassment, motherfuckers – not cool!”
He proceeded to give the audience permission to punch anyone who was “fucking with [us]” in the face. This was met with loud cheers and nods of approval from everyone in the crowd. Next, Zac proclaimed that there was “too much dick on the dance floor”, and ordered one of the staples of a FIDLAR show: the girls-only mosh pit.
I had been waiting for this. I am a girl, I am a fan of FIDLAR, and I enjoy mosh pits when I don’t feel like someone is going to (accidentally, I think) punch me in the face. This was my time to shine. We girls moved in towards the stage, and the band gave us “Stoked and Broke” for our moment of punk rock girl power. If you ask me, there were still too many dicks in the pit, but what can you do?
New songs from the band’s forthcoming third record, Almost Free, including “Too Real” and “Can’t You See” were well-received by the crowd; everyone already seemed to know the words to “Can’t You See,” a song which had been released less than a week prior. Additionally, FIDLAR played through their well-known favorites, including party anthems “Wake Bake Skate,” “40oz. On Repeat,” and “Cheap Beer.” One of the band’s best attributes is that they know how to cater to the crowd.
As the night (ironically) wound down to “Cocaine,” no one looked any worse for wear. Sure, we were all dripping sweat, shirts had been torn, and phones were lost. Countless shoes had been held up throughout the night as good-natured moshers did their duty to try to locate their owners. And yeah, my friend did have someone else’s blood on his shirt, but you know what? It was all in good fun. This was a FIDLAR show after all, and if you left in the same condition that you came, did you even have fun?
FIDLAR’s Zac Carper talks new music, the benefits of college radio, and getting recognition as more than just a “party punk” band
Los Angeles punk rock band FIDLAR is well known for their songs about beer, skateboarding, and drugs. Their live shows are loud and raucous affairs, a place for kids to work out their aggression and energy in the mosh pit (including the band’s famous “girls only” mosh pits). However, despite the hard-partying image they’ve cultivated (the meaning behind their name’s acronym, “Fuck It Dog, Life’s a Risk” is a skater’s version of Nike’s “Just Do It”), the members of FIDLAR are not the slackers many make them out to be. The band has released two records (2013’s FIDLAR and 2015’s Too) amidst years of constant touring, while their third record, Almost Free, is slated for release in early 2019. On top of all this, they’ve managed to keep the same original members, while facing personal issues such as drug addiction and death. The fun-loving, party band reputation may not be entirely undeserved, but their work ethic and dedication to sticking together is something that ought to be admired.
KCR’s Andrea Renney recently spoke with lead singer and guitarist Zac Carper in advance of their October 18th show at the North Park Observatory. The following interview has been edited for clarity and conciseness.
KCR: So you just finished the first leg of your fall tour at the end of September, over on the East Coast. Then you’re about to start the second leg on Thursday [October 18th] here in San Diego at the Observatory. How was the first leg of the tour, and how was the response to your new music?
Zac: It was super fun. We tour a lot, you know. We haven’t toured America in a long time. We were doing Europe for a little bit and I just forgot how fun it is to play in America, you know what I mean? Especially bigger cities like Chicago, New York, Philly. And the band that we took on tour was super fun, this band called NOBRO. They were awesome. And this band called Dilly Dally. So it was just a good time, good vibes, and everybody was getting along.
Z: No, they’re from Montreal. We were doing the East Coast, which is closer to them, so it would be easier for them. And then for the West Coast we’re taking this band called The Side Eyes.
KCR: Oh sick, that’s really cool. I’m actually from Canada myself, but I’m from Vancouver, so the other side.
KCR: Yeah, west side. So other than that, you’ve been releasing some new music throughout 2018. I know “Alcohol” came out earlier this year, followed by “Too Real”. Now “Can’t You See” just came out last week, and you’ve got your new album [Almost Free] coming out in January, is that correct? Next year?
KCR: So, I mean, it’s been three years since Too came out. Has this album kind of been in the works for that entire time?
Z: Unfortunately, yeah (laughs). It just takes a long time now, man. You know, I always say the shitty part about DIY is you have to do it yourself.
Z: And that’s kind of the reality of it. We’re not on a major label, we don’t have those kind of budgets to rent out fancy studios and go work. Like, for us to pay our rent and for us to sustain a living, we have to be on the road constantly, you know?
Z: And being on the road is kind of like a different shift of the brain. You have to focus on the road. Sometimes I’ll write on the road. Like that song “Alcohol”: it took a while to write that song. I think I wrote some of the vocal melodies and lyrics in Australia, so it’s kind of like piecing things together. It’s just a different way of doing things nowadays. And on top of that, when Too came out, the first year we toured we did something like 32 flights, and 12 of them were in Europe. In one year. You know, it’s just a lot. It’s a different thing. And this was before we were really doing things comfortably. We were still touring in vans every now and then and just going for it. So we didn’t have the comfort of having a bus and being able to play guitar on it. We were just stuck in this van.
KCR: I get that. Coming off of tour and then going back to the studio and back and forth for years, I can imagine that it would be hard to sort of switch between those two ways of living. It makes sense that an album would take a bit longer when you’re having to go on tour all the time.
Z: Yeah. And we wanted to change it up, too, you know what I mean? I feel like sometimes time just makes you change things up, you know?
KCR: Oh, absolutely. Moving on, would you say the new album is going to be quite different, to the point where people are going to notice it?
Z: I think so. We’ve only had two records out, but those two records are pretty different from each other.
Z: I mean, that’s kinda the whole point for us. We don’t wanna stick with one thing too much, you know?
KCR: No, definitely. I feel like that’s pretty common, not even related to music. Everyone changes, it’s a way of life. And kind of as an example, I know that you produced The Frights’ last two records. Those two records are very different. So there’s another band that’s very much reinventing themselves and always changing.
Z: Yeah. I think for fans of music, there’s two sides: where they don’t want the band to change, but then people also get mad when the band doesn’t change. Because then it’s just the same thing over and over again. And there’s no winning in that scenario. That’s something that I’ve had a conversation with Mikey [Carnevale] from The Frights about. Like, you can’t think about that shit because then you’re not writing music for you anymore, you know what I mean? You’re just trying to please an audience, and that just doesn’t last long.
KCR: Yeah, absolutely. Then the music probably isn’t gonna turn out that well and it’s really not genuine if you’re just trying to please people. You just can’t win. I’ve definitely felt that before with bands and I feel bad about it but, you know, sometimes you just form a bond with a record and then the next one’s different, and then you’re kinda sad. But you have to be happy for the band.
Z: I know (laughs). I’ve done that since I was a kid. I remember when Modest Mouse came out and I was like, “This is the best!” Then another record came out and I was just like, “I can’t do it anymore”, you know? But I still support them. You know what I do? I go back and listen to the record that changed my life. And that’s the thing that I present to people that call us out for changing. It’s like, what are you guys complaining about? Just go listen to the record you like!
KCR: I agree. So I read that you worked with Ricky Reed to produce this new record, is that correct?
KCR: Who, as far as I know, is known more for producing kind of pop-oriented stuff. How was that experience, and what do you think he brought to the table regarding the sound of your new record?
Z: It was extremely weird because when I met with Ricky, I didn’t know he wanted to do a FIDLAR record. I do some writing sessions on the side, so I thought that he wanted me to work on some pop stuff. I was like, “What am I doing here?” and he was like, “Oh, I wanna work on a FIDLAR record,” and I’m like “Why?” (laughs).
Z: Yeah. And he’s just one of the most talented people I’ve ever met. The way he works is just so unique. The past year I’ve produced a couple bands, so I know how to record and I know how to do the production aspect, and he was willing to just use the demos that me and Elvis have been creating, and then build on top of that. So it was just a different way of working, a different style. He taught us that there are no rules in this thing, you know? Like, most of the stuff I wrote was on my laptop. I got into drum machines and stuff like that, and he was like, “Yeah, why wouldn’t you? Why wouldn’t you try that stuff?” It doesn’t always have to be guitar and bass and drums and vocals. Let’s get weird, let’s try stuff. We even got into adding horns to songs.
I know people label him as a pop producer but I think he’s just one of the most brilliant producers in general. And he’s the most fuckin’ punk rock dude I know, man. He’s the most humble person ever. There are a lot of producers in LA, you know, and a lot of them are pretty sleazy and flashy. They all drive fancy cars and are just kinda weird. That motherfucker’s driving a fucking beat up Prius that he still has, lives in a super modest house, has an amazing family. The way that he does everything, I was like, I really respect this guy and I feel like we can get on a level, you know? And when we started hanging out, literally all we were doing was cracking each other up. And that was kinda the point. All the other people that I’ve worked with, everything was so serious. I’m like, I don’t think you guys are getting what FIDLAR is. FIDLAR has always had that humor to it, that we have to keep because I don’t wanna take this shit too seriously. We do take it seriously, but… I’m not fuckin’ Tom Yorke here, I’m not trying to fucking reinvent the fucking wheel, you know what I’m saying?
KCR: Yeah, you can take things seriously but also still have fun and not take yourself too seriously in the process. To me, that’s the perfect way to be.
Z: Yeah, so that’s why me and Ricky got along really well. Presenting him to the band, they were all like, “Ah, he’s a pop producer, how is this gonna work?” But then once they met him they were like, “Oh my god, this is awesome.” It was a cool thing, it was very unique.
Z: Yeah. And even with our second record, the producer we used was a pop/country producer, so it’s kinda always been a weird FIDLAR fashion to be like, okay, maybe with the last couple producers, it made the most sense to use that guy. But then at the same time, we’re already a punk rock band, you know what I mean? What if we offset it with something different? And something cool would come out of that.
KCR: Exactly. And, again, you don’t want to just keep making the same stuff. You should be trying new things and seeing what comes with it – why not?
KCR: Yeah, I think I get it. On the topic of FIDLAR always being kind of humorous, the song “Too Real” seems pretty serious to me, pretty political.
Z: Yeah, I know. People in interviews, they’ve been asking me questions about that song a lot. The thing about it is it’s not choosing one side or the other. It’s not talking shit on one side or the other, it’s literally just saying what I hear going on. All this input that’s been happening over the past couple years, whether it be politics or social media or the left and the right movement, I’m just kind of writing lyrics that point those things out. It’s not like I’m taking a side or anything. It’s just like “Yo, you guys, you all sound fucking ridiculous”. That’s what this is. And that’s me included, you know what I mean? We’re all fucked up.
KCR: No, absolutely. And I think that comes through pretty explicitly that this isn’t some right-side bashing song. It’s commentary on the state of the world.
KCR: Was there a specific incident where you thought, “This is messed up, I need to write this song,” or was it more of a general response to the government and our society focused on things like social media and always being politically correct?
Z: You know what, I don’t really quite remember what it was. I do know that I made the music of it, like the beat and the track of it, after doing a session with these guys called GTA. They’re an EDM duo. And I was blown away by how they work, how they use their laptops. Their laptop is like their guitar, you know? I was like, I wanna learn how to do this stuff, so I went to my studio and just made this beat, and that’s what that whole track is basically. Then I think I just let it sit for a while and then I had to lay down lyrics for it, and… I think I was probably fighting with my girlfriend at the time or something (laughs).
KCR: It’s funny that it kind of stemmed from that EDM group, since you have that line in the song pretending that EDM never happened.
Z: I was talking to them about EDM, and they’re like a huge EDM band, you know? And they were saying musicians and bands don’t treat them like they’re musicians. I totally understood that, and I felt that when FIDLAR started. I felt like people weren’t treating us like musicians because we would just get drunk and play three chords and yell. So “let’s pretend that EDM didn’t happen at all” is not a bash on EDM, it’s like a bash on-
Z: Yeah, exactly. It’s the old people, I call them “rockets”, as in they only like rock music or a certain thing. But that’s the whole point, like “let’s pretend that EDM didn’t happen at all” – that song is basically an EDM track (laughs). I used the fucking kick sample, the drum pack – all the samples are from an EDM pack. So that was kinda the joke about it, but I don’t think people got it. I think they just think I’m talking shit on EDM.
KCR: Well I’m glad I know that now. Anyways, let’s move onto some trivia. On the topic of a song like “Too Real”, where it’s a bit more serious, you’ve said yourself that other musicians wouldn’t really view you as musicians. You’re just getting drunk, a “party band.” But “Too Real” is a great example of a serious song, while even something like “Stupid Decisions” is pretty personal. Do you think that FIDLAR is misunderstood in their reputation as a party band, and is it something you’d like to change? Or are you kinda just okay with that?
Z: I mean…look. Half of it’s our fault, writing songs called “Cheap Beer” and “Wake Bake Skate” and “Cocaine”, you know what I mean? Like, okay, I get it, we get it. Half of it’s our fault. And maybe it’s the name of the band, or our whole image or whatever – the goofiness of it – and for us in the media we really try to go for this party punk band, slacker punks, burnouts, that whole thing, you know?
The reality is, we wouldn’t be where we are if we were slackers or burnouts. We work really hard at what we do. Elvis [Kuehn] and Max [Kuehn] have been playing music since they were so young. I believe Elvis is a once in a lifetime musician, you know. He’s one of those savant dudes. He plays piano, he plays every instrument so well. So I feel like we do get discredited a lot for being musicians. A lot of people have labeled us as this party punk band, but we work really fucking hard at what we do, and we’re constantly working.
KCR: That must be tough. Obviously the music’s gonna get whatever label it’s gonna get, but it’s still unfortunate that you then get that sort of reputation. Like, “Oh, they’re just slackers,” or whatever. But you’ve released two records, kind of on your own. Obviously you’re working hard – this stuff doesn’t just happen.
Z: Yeah. And all while dealing with life shit. That’s the other thing that people don’t realize: we’ve been a band for almost ten years now. And it’s been the same members, the exact same members the entire time.
Z: That’s fucking RARE, dude. When does that happen, exactly. And it’s like, we have to deal with life shit. I got hooked on heroin, Elvis is going through some shit, Brandon [Schwartzel] is going through some shit, Max goes through some shit. We have to deal with life shit and we’ve had to learn how to talk to each other, and how to settle our differences and build our bond stronger. It just doesn’t really fucking happen that much. Musicians like to blow things up, like “Fuck this, I’m outta here.” But nah, that’s the easy way.
KCR: Yeah. The fact that you didn’t even break up given a serious addiction, and that you’ve remained the same members – I don’t know, I think you should get some recognition for that.
Z: Yeah, it’s been a lot harder than people think it is. And I think the press and media and stuff like to label us as “These guys just like to smoke weed and go to the studio and make music.” And, like, yeah… but we do it smart.
KCR: Exactly. Everyone does different things, but at least you’re working hard at it. So just last week, “Can’t You See” came out. Can you tell me what it’s about? I was kinda getting the vibe that it was about the superficial side of the world in general, but maybe more specifically Los Angeles these days, with the whole “gluten free” thing and “meditating” and “getting rich quick”.
Z: Yeah, totally. It’s totally about that. To me, that song is like that dude at the party that’s just coked out of his mind. Maybe he’s a musician, or maybe he “makes beats”. He’s a producer or something like that. He’s showing you his band through his iPhone speaker. Like, “Listen to this, isn’t this cool?” And you’re just like, “Fuck, I feel like I’m trapped in a cage right now.” That’s kinda what we were channeling with that song.
That song wouldn’t have happened without Ricky though. Elvis had that riff and he had the verse to it, and in FIDLAR fashion we would’ve made it super loud and grungy. But then Ricky was just like, “Let’s do a song that’s just mellow.” And we were like, “Whoa, we’ve never done that before.” So we tried and we just had so much fun doing it. And we learned something in that process, that it’s actually harder to play quieter. Because you have to lock into the groove more. It’s easy to just turn shit up and strum hard.
KCR: Yeah, absolutely. And if you’re quiet or slower, people might notice mistakes more, whereas when you’re just playing loud and fast, your attitudes shifts into “Whatever, just do it.”
KCR: That’s awesome. So I have one final question, and it’s related to radio. FIDLAR was somewhat recently added to KROQ’s regular rotation, which is really cool. Congratulations.
KCR: You’re welcome. With music streaming services being the primary method of music consumption these days, do you think that radio is still a really important service for reaching new fans and getting your music out there?
Z: Yeah, I do. I really do. Not everybody can look on YouTube, you know what I mean? I come from a place where the only radio station was college radio, and that was literally where I found all my music. On Sundays, on this radio station, these guys had this three hour block and they played everything from Wu-Tang to Beastie Boys, whatever. They just played whatever and that’s how I learned about music, to be honest. Not everybody has the internet. Most people do, and a lot of people have smartphones and things like that. But I just think there’s something to be said about curated music instead of just having a whole library of shit to get lost in, you know what I mean? Because then you’re just like, “What do I listen to?” Having a DJ or specific songs picked out, I think that’s such a unique perspective.
KCR: Absolutely. And I know you can get curated playlists, but it’s not really the same. You don’t get that personal touch, but you also don’t get the commentary on the songs. That’s why I like listening to radio, for the curated aspect of it.
Z: Yeah, and with radio you don’t get to know what the next song is. I think that’s the joy of the radio thing for me, you’re just like “Oh, what’s gonna be next?” you know? It’s not a fucking list.

I just heard the following advertisement from 1948 on a CD of old radio programs:<blockquote><p>And in our brief intermission, there’s just time to consider a matter of utmost importance to every cigarette smoker. How mild can a cigarette be? Smoke Camels and see!</p><p>Prove for yourself what noted throat specialists reported about Camel mildness in a coast-to-coast smoking test. In this test, hundreds of men and women smoked Camels—and only Camels—for thirty days, an average of one to two packs a day.</p><p>After making weekly examinations of the throats of the hundreds of men and women who took part in this Camel test (2,470 careful examinations in all), the doctors reported not one single case of throat irritation due to smoking Camels. Yes, the doctors reported not one single case of throat irritation due to smoking Camels!</p><p>Make the Camel mildness test yourself. Test Camels in your “T” zone: “T” for taste and “T” for throat. If at any time you’re not convinced that Camels are the mildest cigarette you’ve ever smoked, return the package with the unused cigarettes to the makers of Camels and you will receive its full purchase price plus postage.</p></blockquote>Amazing.

I've just finished my most delightful Christmas movie marathon, although sadly not in my new flat, because I'm not going to be in there till January, which is a whole other tragic and horrible story that we won't even get into now, because this is a time for Christmas happiness, not flat related misery.
In November, I asked for suggestions for favourite Christmas movies. I scoured eBay and my DVD collection for the finest Christmas movies my meagre amount of money could find, and came up with what I think is a pretty damn fine list.
I was planning on watching all of these fabulouso films on Christmas day, but that plan went down the drain when I did a bit of math and realized that I had about 28 hours worth of Christmassy goodness. So, two days it is!
We started off with One Magic Christmas, which is a movie we had when I was a kid and I loved, loved, loved. And I'm pleased to say that I love it still. Mary Steenburgen stars as a woman who doesn't like Christmas, and her adorable daughter conspires with an angel, played by Harry Dean Stanton in an interesting casting choice, to give her the Christmas spirit. It has more kidnapping and murder than you'd expect in a movie about Christmas. Delightful!
Next was the 1951 version of Scrooge, the black and white version, as recommended by Aaron. I'd never seen this before, and I liked it, although the early 50's overacting got a bit much at times. It's a classic though, and I'm happy to now own it.
The second A Christmas Carol movie of the marathon was Scrooged, which I love. Bill Murray at his most Bill Murrayist. Carol Kane as the ghost of Christmas present who keeps kicking his ass. Alfre Woodard, who always rocks. Bobcat Goldwaith as a character who didn't annoy the crap out of me. Robert Goulet as himself. Delightful!! I did fast forward through some of the boring bits, but this movie is a holiday classic.
Christmas with SCTV was something I'd never come across before, but I saw it on eBay and knew it must be mine. It's two one hour specials - the 1981 and 1982 Christmas specials as they aired on TV. It's full of the classic SCTV characters, and I did like it, but it was a bit long. Next!
Another Christmas classic that was recommended but I'd not seen was The Ref. Normally I don't like the Spacey, but I did here. And I loved the Christmas wreath/candle head things that they wear. I want to get me one of those. It's chock full of swearing and yelling which is a nice break from the sap of Christmas.
I don't save it for Christmas, because I like to watch it all year, but Elf is a delightful movie that I love, love, love. Seen it a million times, and still love, love, love it. This was Sean's recommendation and I have to agree. "You sit on a throne of lies" is a line that makes me aught to even think about. Ha!
The final movie of Christmas Eve was A Christmas Story, which is the Christmassy of most Christmas classics. I want a Red Rider BB Gun for Christmas. And I will not shoot my eye out! Little Randy with his over stuffed snow suit and pig noises is so adorably cute, I could die. Adorable!
Merry Christmas! We begin with my favourite Christmas cartoon, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, and I would like to clarify that I do not acknowledge the existence of that crappy Jim Carrey monstrosity. I love this cartoon. That's all I have to say about this. Love.
Next up was Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer, the first in my unintentional Rankin/Bass mini-marathon. This is a Christmas classic, and I love it, but man, is it sexist! "They knew they should fight the abominable snowman, but felt it was best to get the women folk home". Shocking! You'd think this was made in 1864, not 1964.
In 1987, my parents taped A Claymation Christmas Celebration from TV, and it was one of my favourites. I found it again on eBay and I was super excited! And, it did not disappoint! Herb and Rex, the dinosaurs hosting our claymation fun, are hilarious, the songs are great, the California Raisins are so freakin' cool. How can you go wrong?
Next in the unintentional Rankin/Bass mini-marathon, was Frosty the Snowman. Again, a classic. And again, dated! How does Frosty know what a thermometer is, but not know what a stoplight is? Huh? Tell me that! And Karen is a troublemaker, what with the "I'm going to the North Pole too". And I'm going to be honest with you here - they did steal the magician's hat! There, I said it.
The Little Drummer Boy was the next in the unintentional Rankin/Bass mini-marathon. I haven't seen this since I was a kid, and I totally thought it was the story of the Little Drummer Boy turning up at the stable. And I was right, because apparently I got Book II, not the original. Which is the story of The Drummer Boy and one of the wise men saving some silver bells. Not as fabulous. A bit of a Christmas disappointment, I have to say.
Tim recommended one of his Christmas favourites, The Year Without a Santa Claus, the final film in the unintentional Rankin/Bass mini-marathon. I'd never seen this one, but it's not too shabby. Basically, Santa gets whiny, decides no one likes him and decides to cancel Christmas. And who has to save the day? Mrs. Claus, that's who. Still a bit sexist, though. I don't know if those Rankin/Bass guys like the ladies too much.
In the world of poorly animated Christmas cartoon specials, I may like A Garfield Christmas best. John, Odie and Garfield go to the farm for Christmas with Mom, Dad, Doc Boy and Grandma. And who knew that I knew the words to "Let's Have A Good Old Fashioned Christmas Down On The Farm"? Cause, you know, a little overeatin' never did you any harm.
The pinnacle of Christmas cartoons is A Charlie Brown Christmas, which is a classic of classic proportions. Charlie Brown finding the meaning of Christmas? Who wouldn't love that? I love the songs and the kid voices and Linus revealing the true meaning of Christmas. And Snoopy with the decorations. Aw!
The final A Christmas Carol movie in the marathon is Abby's recommendation, A Muppet Christmas Carol. And it is fan-freaking-tastic. Michael Caine is fabulous, Kermit is a moving Bob Cratchitt, Gonzo is delightful as narrator Charles Dickens and Rizzo the Rat is fabulous as himself. The songs are great and I love, love, love it. Man, I love, love, love a lot of Christmas movies, don't I?
Just in time for Christmas dinner is Christmas classic Miracle on 34th Street - the black & white original, not the remake. Aw, this movie is so good. Maureen O'Hara is awesome, and Natalie Wood is so freakin' cute I could eat her up with a spoon. Adorable! And the ending is so great. It's everything a Christmas movie should be.
The best of all Christmas movies, I say, is It's A Wonderful Life. So. Amazingly. Good. I've seen it almost every year, and it's still fabulous. Fab. U. Lous. I get all teary at the end every time. Aw, so Christmassy fantastic!
And last, but not least, we have Janice's recommendation White Christmas. I already had this Christmas goodie, and it's fantastic. I love Bing Crosby and with the singing and the dancing and the fabulous, it's a Christmas delight. The only song I don't like is Choreography, but I can always fast forward. Delightful!
There were a few suggestions I didn't get to - Mike's suggestion of National Lampoon's Chritmas Vacation because I hate this movie. Hate! And I couldn't find Sarah's suggestion of The Box of Delights. And Sean suggested I drink eggnog, which I hate like poison.
So you say. Would it kill you to buy me a nice gift every once in a while? Or take me out for a nice meal?
Diet DR PEPPER? You know that degree is fake, right. Doctor, my ass. Diet Mr. Pepper is more like it.
Ew. I wouldn't touch Diet Sprite if it were the last pop on Earth. But is it my fault you ran out on Swiss Chalet and Pizza Pizza, leaving me with NO CHOICE but Diet Pepsi?
You're right. I haven't always been there for you. Legal wrangling, too painful to go into now, means that I can no longer associate with delicious Swiss Chalet or delectable Pizza Pizza.
If you can forgive me, I can forgive you. Let's start over. There's no point fighting - not at Christmas!
I'm using up my holiday before the end of the year, so I took off Friday and today. Which would all be very delightful if I hadn't spent the last two days in bed feeling wretched.
I've had a sore throat for a few days, but really thought I wasn't going to get properly sick. I was out dancing on Saturday night until about 4:30 am, and when I woke up on Sunday at 9:30 I thought I was feeling miserable due to the dreaded hangover/not-enough-sleep combination.
So, I've spent the last two days in bed. Sleeping tons and watching bad TV and reading the Lion The Witch and The Wardrobe books (I'm currently on The Silver Chair). Feeling miserable and taking lots of medication. Ahhhh, Lemsip. How I love you.
But you know what the most unfair bit is? Not that I didn't get my Christmas shopping done today. Not that I missed out on lunch with Leanne. Not that I'm actually watching the horrible Space Cadets. Not that I didn't get a chance to buy some new clothes, which I'd planned to do today. Not that I'm almost out of Kleenex.
It's that I'm feeling a bit better. Which probably means I'm going to be okay to go to work tomorrow.

Stress isn’t just a word, nor is it something we simply feel from time to time. It’s much more complex than that. Why? Because there are different types of stress, and they all come with their own characteristics and symptoms. Our approach to how we handle stress also differs depending on the type of stress it is you’re experiencing. For example, is it acute, episodic, or chronic? Knowing the difference is important.
As a family physician, acute stress is the most common form of stress that Dr. Ali Ghahary sees in patients. This type of stress is often brought on by being under pressure or having demands placed upon you, and while those are the types of challenges that some people might find thrilling – at least initially – it’s when they become repetitive that you may start to feel as though you are being tested beyond your limits, thus causing the feeling of stress. When it comes to acute stress, the symptoms are easily recognizable. You might feel anxious, have an upset stomach, or develop tension headaches. You may even develop muscle pain, back pain, stomach gastrointestinal problems (such as heartburn, constipation or diarrhea), sweaty palms, and elevated blood pressure. We all experience acute stress at some point in our lives, and it’s usually easy to manage.
Episodic stress, on the other hand, tends to occur more frequently. It is most common in individuals who are in a rush to get somewhere or do something, take on too many projects (whether it’s work related or personal), and cannot seem to get good grasp or handle at all of the demands and things vying for their attention. Individuals suffering from episodic stress tend to feel anxious, tense, nervous, and are usually irritable – and that irritability can sometimes be mistaken for hostility, too. It’s also not uncommon for an individual with episodic stress to be in a rush and abrupt, and they may notice a decline in both personal and interpersonal relationships. There are also two variations of episodic stress – Type A, where individuals tend to be competitive, aggressive and impatient, or Type B, where individuals exhibit opposite behaviours and over-worry. Symptoms of episodic stress are similar to those of acute stress, but also include migraine headaches, chest pain, and even heart disease. In order to decrease episode stress, certain lifestyle changes may have to be made, as well as how you perceive the world. To do this, Dr. Ali Ghahary says patients may benefit from seeing some type of therapist – either a psychologist or psychiatrist – as well as partaking in cognitive behavioural therapy.
Lastly, there’s chronic stress. Compared to acute and episode stress, chronic stress can be much more difficult to treat – and patients often experience it day after day as it wreaks havoc on both the body and the mind. Chronic stress can be triggered by a variety of different things, such as childhood trauma (or any kind of trauma in general), declining personal relationships (such as going through a bad break-up or divorce, ending friendships, or family matters), problems at school or in the workplace, etc. As we go through these experiences, we often internalize them, which only makes the feelings of stress and anxiety even worse. With chronic stress a person often feels hopeless and as if there’s no light at the end of the tunnel. How chronic stress impacts a person can be devastating. It can cause an individual to seclude him or herself, make them more prone to violence, develop addiction (such as alcoholism and illicit drug use) as a coping mechanism, and even increase the risk of other mental health disorders like depression, which can increase the risk of suicide. It is important for anyone experiencing chronic stress to have ongoing treatment, which is often both by use of medications as well as therapy, and report any abnormal thoughts or behaviours to your physician.

Since ney and I don’t live together, there are really times that he misses our daughter and I. He lives in the province where he attends to their business. They are contractor which mostly deals with road widening and power plant construction. Recently, I need to go to Quezon to check on him for he’s kinda losing “out of his way”. He said that he wanted to be with us but he can’t. To ease that kind of longing, he just spent his time drinking beer and the like. But, he’s being out of control.
Anyway, last Thursday, Nonet and I had a night trip to Quezon. It was our first time to go there alone. I mean just being with each other. We went to Jac Liner bus station in Cubao to get a ride going to Lucena. There aren’t much aircon buses that will pass directly our town in Quezon unless you’ll take the bus bound to Bicol. So, we just had a cutting trip to Lucena and then another bus ride to our town. It took us around 5 and a half hour to reach our town. It was already 10:30 PM when we arrived. My aunt Lyn fetch us from the town proper and then we took a tricycle ride to their house.
It was really our plan to stay at ney’s house but he’s drank I don’t want to compromise my daughter so we opt to stay at my aunt’s house. I just sent ney a text message that we arrived already and that we’ll just see each other the following day.
Nonet slept soundly maybe because of the long hours of travel. She was really tired. We woke up early the following day, and she really enjoyed the lawn of my aunt. Nice bermuda grasses are growing beautifully at her backyard. I felft a very calm and relaxing feeling
Our little town in Quezon is a place where you’ll experience the “province ambience” thing. Fresh air, green scenery, moutains, seas. Peace and quiet place. It is a place where you could really rest your mind from the busy surrounding of the city!
My friends Manoline, Arview, Khaki and Marez took a day off at Tagaytay City yesterday. I asked them to buy a Señorita banana for me when they get there. And, they were so thoughtful that they didn’t forget it. Though it’s kinda heavy Thanks guys!
My last visit to Tagaytay was about 3-4 years ago. I don’t really remember. But it was in May. My sister who is a member of CFCA had a birthday outing then. She was born on May 28 and so she was one of the birthday celebrants of the month. My mother used to be an assistant coordinator. I actually wasn’t part of the trip but, mama told me to dress up and have my bag ready for something like a “chance passenger”. If not all celebrants will come then I will have a spot. Luckily, I was able to join them.
We took C5 road then to Alabang so the trip is shorter than an hour. Tagaytay City is part of Cavite province. It is famous not only because of its cool climate but because, there lies the smallest volcano in the world, Taal Volcano. It has been said that the “volcano” which is visible to the human’s eye is actually the creater of a big volcano which is submerged within the Taal Lake. There are some who call it a volcano within a volcano.
My mother had a countless visits there and she that she never had a clear view of the volcano until our visit there. She said that I was lucky to see the volcano in clear view.
On our way to Tagaytay we passed by a church which I forgot the name. I’m not sure if it’s the Calaruega but I doubt it. It is just a small church but the ambiance is very solemn. I even told myself then that I would like to get married there.
We first went to People’s Park in the Sky. It used to be called Palace in the Sky. Stories said that it was built for the Marcoses during President Marcos regime as their rest house.
The park overlooks Tagaytay city. It was very relaxing there and you can really spend time for “emote” moments.
When it was time to go home, we dropped by the Pink Sisters convent. Since, it was my first time to be there, I uttered a prayer and my wishes. I don’t even remember what my wishes are. But Pau told me that her wishes came true. :)
We also went to Christ the King seminary which is just beside the convent. My Tito Nonoy used to be a seminarian and he had a lot of unforgettable memories there.
I really enjoyed my visit there. Special thanks to Ma’am Aliw and Kuya Nelson for allowing me to join the trip.
I was talking to honey last night and he was happy to inform me that he’s working on another project again. He said that this time, he will see to it that he will focus on this project and work very hard until it is finish. As you know, Ney’s family is a contractor. They usually have road widening projects, beach resort improvement and the like.
Ney is not just a good driver of cars and owner type jeeps but he is very good operator of heavy equipments as well. His favorite is the Back hoe. Yet among the vehicles that his family owns, there is one automobile that he loves most. That is, the good old owner type jeep which he calls “push button”. One time, when I was in the province to spend quality time with him, we went to our favorite diner with Push button. It is not as good and new as their other cars, so we had experienced some mechanical problems. It was a good thing that there is a roadside assistance that we can turn to. I believe having a roadside assistance is really a big help for drivers and commuters.
We arrived at the diner an hour after that incident safe and sound. I told Ney that maybe he could get an insurance like caa insurance for we really never know what’s going to happen when he’s on the street and driving. I also encouraged him to join some auto club for he loves cars and equipment. Well, Ney being a occasional submissive partner, he agreed to what I told him and he actually availed an insurance and joined the club the following day!
Antoinette will turn 3 this October 28. Since she’s fond of animals, I plan to bring her to Manila Zoo. Manila Zoo and Botanical Garden is the oldest and popular zoo in the Philippines. It was born on May 18, 1959 by virtue of City Ordinance No. 4135 and was inaugurated on July 25, 1959 under the administration of Mayor Arsenio Lacson.
It houses wild animals and other animals and I know Nonet will really enjoy viewing. I like her to see the mighty elephant and her favorite big cats, the Lion and the Tiger!
I can no longer wait for that day and maybe if our budget will allow us maybe we’ll take a trip to Manila Ocean park as well.
I have mentioned in my previous post that if I will in another country , or I will be given a chance to visit another continent, it would be Europe. And I would definitely take some city breaks in Rome.
As I continue my research about this historical city, I learned that there are many places that I will be interested in. Well, not only I, but other tourists who would love to taste Rome city breaks and be part of its rich past and cultures. Even if you would only spend some Rome short breaks, that would be long enough to take pleasure in its prehistoric times.
Aside from my dream of visiting the Vatican City, there are a lot more places that Rome has to offer. Places that will definitely give you comfort and take you back in time on how Rome earns its name today.
A visit to Vatican museum and St. Peter’s Basilica is one of the place of interest when visiting in Rome.
Colosseum is an arena, which was designed to hold more than fifty thousand spectators. The remains of the Colosseum could ba a dramatic sight, but taking a tour inside it would reveal its history.
This is where the ancient Romans worshipped their gods and goddeses. They even built temples to honor those who are feared most. These temples of include temples of Saturn, Castor and Pollux. There were also built commemorating the goddesses Venus and Roma.
This church is considered one of the Bernini’s finest works. It has been regarded as a Baroque masterpiece. It was built sometime in the 17th century and its interior creates such a statement.
Rome’s Seven Hills played a huge part in Rome’s history. All the seven hills are located in the east of the Tiber River. But due to natural disasters, most hills will now be hard to find due to erosion and buildings are being built in its slopes. The Seven Hills are: Capitoline, Palatine, Aventine, Caelian, Esquiline, Viminal, and Quirinal. Today, Capitoline Hill is the most visible as well as is the Palatine. Those hills are the most visited hills in Rome.
If I were to ask what place in the world I’d like to go to, it would definitely be Europe, specifically in Italy. Being a Catholic, I definitely would love to go Rome. I like to see the places that are associated with Jesus. I like to be in the different churches in Rome. There was this tale or some sort of a saying that if it is your first time to be in a church then you can make a wish and your wish will come true. Visit the Vatican City and hear mass with the pope. I also like to pay respect to the tomb of my favorite pope, John Paul the II. Oh how I love to stay in Hotel Naples, which will make my visit unforgettable!
Another place that I would like to visit is the City of Florence and experience what Hotel Florence has to offer. One of my all time favorite movie is “While you were Sleeping”. And, Lucy played by Sandra Bullock, has this dream of having her passport stamped with Florence, Italy. I wonder what is it in Florence why Lucy would love to be there. Like her, I’d like someone will take me there for our honeymoon. Could it be honey? I hope so. ? I like to see it my self and have some pictures taken with its beautiful places!
There are so many popular cities in the US that tourists from all over the world go to. Most likely, New York City is one of the most visited cities there. My friend and sister in Christ, Mayet, found her love and the person she like to spend the rest of her life with Phil. He’s a US citizen and he brought Ate Mayet there. When we are on chat the other day, she told me the excitement she felt when she first visited the New York City. She said that they took the JFK Airport Shuttle when they get off the plane. The shuttle sent them to their hotel somewhere on 125th street. She said that one thing she would never forget in their visit is the shuttle. Go Airlink Shuttle which website is www.goairlinkshuttle.com offers affordable, reliable and safe ground transportation services throughout New York City and surrounding suburbs. She said that she asked her husband to bring her first to Statue of Liberty. Of course aside from Disneyland, Universal Studios, the Hollywood and the Golden Gate, the Statue of Liberty is one of the famous and historical tourist spots in the US. For it is not only a sign of liberation, but also a friendship between the countries France and USA.
As she gazed the magnificent statue, she said that she could not believe that she is looking at it in its great form and no longer in pictures!
As we end our long chat, Ate Yet told me she and Kuya Phil are yet to visit soon other places in the US and she will send me pictures of those places. Well what do I need to tell her but, enjoy!
Statue of Liberty in New York City is one of the famous landmarks of the United States of America. It is actually a gift of the French government to US as sign of friendship in 1886. It was shipped to US by parts. It completed and erected on October 28, 1886. If someone has to visit New York which is in the West Coast of US, Statue of Liberty will first come to their minds. The magnificent Liberty stands 151 ft (46 m) tall, but with the pedestal and foundation, it is 305 ft (93 m) tall feet above sea level.
Visiting the Statue of Liberty and the rest of the city will be as comfortable and convenient as you wanted it to be through New York Bus Charter. The charter transportation can accommodate from 9-57 passengers. The company has been the leader in the transportation agency for more than 20 years. They provide safe, courteous and experienced drivers which will make the trip really pleasant.

Aside from these things, NYC Bus Charter is offering discounted transfers for groups and 10% discounts for companies that purchase tickets in advance. So what are you waiting for? Drop by their site now at www.nycbuscharters.com.
My daughter Antoinette, together with my Mom and my two younger sisters, went to Quezon to pay visit to our paternal grandmother. She’s 89 but still has a good appetite. Well, I would like to share here my father’s province, Quezon.
Quezon province is part of Region 1VA called CaLaBaRZon(Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, Quezon). Executive Order No. 246, dated October 28, 2003, designated Calamba City as the regional center of CALABARZON.
The province formerly known as Tayabas, was explored by the Spaniards in 1571 and 1572 when Juan de Salcedo visited and explored upon the order of the first Spanish Governor General of the Philippines, Miguel Lopez de Legaspi. They passed through the central portion of Tayabas in his march across Laguna Province to Paracale. The following years, Salcedo led his famous expeditions around the northern coast of Luzon. He visited the “CONTRACOSTA” towns of Casiguran, Baler and Infanta.
In 1574, Father Diego de Oropesa, who found a group of native barangays with their own culture and government, founded the municipality of Gumaca, then called Bumaka.
The territory which now constitutes the province of Tayabas was at one time under the jurisdiction of various provinces. The southern and central portions, for example, were in 1585 under the jurisdiction of the province of Bonbon, sometimes called Balayan (now Batangas). the northern portion was divided between Laguna and Nueva Ecija, while the other portion was divided into the provinces of Mindoro, Marinduque and Camarines.
In 1591, Tayabas was created into a province under the name of Kalilayan. Its capital was the ancient town of Tayabas, now a barrio in the town of Unisan where ancient tombs and artifacts can be found. However, by the middle of the 18th century the provincial capital was moved to what is now the municipality of Tayabas.
The year 1595 marked the spiritual birth of Quezon Province with its incorporation into the Diocess of Nueva Caceres. The first Catholic Bishop of the province was Fray Francisco Ortiga, an Agustinian Friar, while its first Alcalde Mayor was Don Simeon Alvarez, who served from 1625 to 1655.
In September 7, 1946, President Manuel A. Roxas, by virtue of Republic Act No. 14 renamed the province to Quezon, in honor of the late President Manuel L. Quezon, the most illustrious son of Baler, formerly part of Quezon.
My father was born in one of the Quezon’s town, Atimonan. Then, during World War II, when Atimonan was conquered by the Japanese, they relocated to Plaridel(Siain). The town is surrounded by mountains and then virgin forests which made it hard for the Japanese to occupy it.
I used to spend my summer vacation there when I was a kid. I love Quezon for I found the love of my life from there. Tell you more about him in different post.

One of my loyal readers and a current third year medical student asked me a question that I know all of us can relate to: how do you think on your feet? For those of you in high school and college this is relevant when a teacher or professor calls on you for an answer in class or for questions after a presentation, but once in medical school, and particularly the clinical years, being able to think on your feet is a crucial skill! In surgery they call it "pimping" - an attending hasn't spoken to you all case until you get into the bowels and then starts hammering you with questions about why this patient needs this procedure, what vessel you're most likely to hit at this particular location, what's the nerve supply, and so on. On medicine the pimping is a little less shotgun style, but you can still be called on for the answer or your opinion on pretty much anything during rounds. And the pimping never ends. Pimping sounds so dirty, so scary! And while it can be nerve-wracking (the unknown element always is), this is just another part of medical education (that some physician teachers actually do really well), and you can own this!
First and foremost - the people you are around, your team, are what will make you or break you. I don't think I can emphasize it enough but the team is everything in medicine, and the team dynamics are key to feeling safe in a space to think on your feet. It's all too easy as a "lowly" medical student to fall into the shadows and not contribute much to the team - in these cases when you get called on for rounds, this may be the first time the team is even hearing your voice! And you will most certainly be terrified and in no mindset to use that amazing mind of yours. Make sure this is not the case. Make you're best effort to get to know everyone on the team - from the attendings and residents to the nurses and social workers. Even if you're only rotating through (as most of us are), these will be your co-workers for at least a week to maybe a month or two, make it enjoyable and get to know everyone! This way, when you get called on in rounds, it doesn't feel like you're being embarrassed in front of an audience of strangers, but instead surrounded by a group of colleagues who are all trying to help. Granted, everyone does not always want to be friends, but rather you make the effort than not. I think this is part of what makes surgery "pimping" particularly scary for most students - many times you're only working with a surgeon once, but if you'll be there for a week it's still so worth it to try and get to know the residents and scrub nurses who will serve as constants even with different surgeons. Just feeling comfortable around someone who is there when you're on the spot will put you a little more at ease.
If you can succeed in the above you'll eliminate a good chunk of the anxiety that comes with thinking on your feet. The rest comes from, you guessed it, preparation! I think we all know that being prepared is the best way to feel confident, and feeling confident is essential to thinking on your feet, but the problem most of us face is that we don't always have the time to prepare as fully as we'd like. The real skill is figuring out how to prepare efficiently.
Let's say you're on rheumatology. Sure every night you could read chapters from a rheumatology textbook in sequential order, but when your attending asks you about your patient's lupus flare, the fact that you spent all night reading about sarcoidosis isn't really going to matter. So read about your patients! If you're in clinic or inpatient, get a list of the patients on the schedule or that your team is caring for and their diagnosis/chief complaint. Target your studying to what you're actually seeing and you'll be more likely to know what's going on when someone puts you on the spot in rounds. As you're doing your reading think of some questions that could be asked on the subject and come up with answers.
Besides being prepared book-wise, it's also nice to know who's going to be asking the questions (which isn't always possible). But especially on surgery, where surgeons are essentially doing the same procedures daily (and therefore have the same set of questions they're used to asking medical students), get the low-down from upperclassmen or people who have worked with him or her before! Some surgeons are all about numbers - statistics and margin sizes and depth, while others are all about anatomy - even knowing something as general as this can help narrow your focus when you're reviewing. Many people also use Surgical Recall for common facts that are asked. See this post for some other books useful for the wards!
So you've done your focused reading and feel comfortable around your team, but now the moment comes during rounds that you're called on unexpectedly, what do you do? First, breathe. This isn't really a surprise. Hopefully you were listening. Listening is really important. You need to know and understand what was actually asked. Shy away from stall tactics to buy yourself more time - especially on rounds, things need to be efficient, so no one will appreciate that. Also know, though, that it is ok to have a few seconds of silence. Instead of freaking out in your head, use those few seconds to actually think about what you know. Hopefully you've prepared adequately and you will know the answer, but sometimes we are hit with something really unexpected and that's ok too. In these cases it's completely fine to work your way through the problem out loud and if you hit the "and that's all I know about that" point there's no shame in saying so. Chances are someone else will know the answer and can help out, but if not, make sure to offer to look it up and discuss later. We're all learning, and as scary as being put on the spot is, it's almost always meant to teach us something we need to know.
I hope this post could help some of you with thinking on your feet! It's a skill we can all improve on and will continue needing improvement as we transition to different rotations and places. Remember that although we could all read a little more to feel more prepared, the key to feeling comfortable when put on the spot is feeling safe with your team. Get to know them!
Thanks Laura!! Your posts are always so timely and super, super helpful! I'll be filing this away for next year!
I literally came to your blog today to ask you a question specifically about this, and ta-dam, I found that my answer had just been posted!
Other than that, I also get really freaked out when I watch TV shows (yes, I know it's different than real life, but still...) and the doctors remember this one thing from their first year of med school.
I have really good memory, but the idea that I'll find out it's not that good when I'm already a surgeon freaks me out... UGH
You have inspired me from the moment I stumbled upon your blog back in my last semester of first year. I have a question though, as a third year medical student and preparing for wards come April by the grace of God, I've found myself having a hard time remembering basic things-anatomy, physiology, biochemistry etc. How have you managed to build confidence and recall especially when on the wards?
I've tried things like tweaking my study time so that I can review basic anatomy before delving into the pathology and current blocks topics but I'll admit sometimes there doesn't seem to be enough time in a day, I've also tried simple things like repeating things that I wrote on flashcards 10x's as it's helped in the past with short term memory for the most part.

I'm not sure I have much to say at this point, not too much has happened. After we got back from our site visit it's been a lot more paperwork and general laying around. Actually right now we're in the middle of our end of training community project, so that's taking up most of our time. Half of our barangay doesn't get trash service since the road there is supposed to be too small, so we're working with the local women's and youth groups to get trash barrels placed around that part of town, and we'll be doing a sanitation "seminar" and a coastal clean up. We have a meeting with the mayor on Sunday to try and get him to bring the truck down there, otherwise we have the funds to buy a little peddle tricycle with a side basket to be used to collect the trash on a weekly basis. I wish I had pictures so you could see the trash, but it's a huge and very unsanitary problem, and we've been lucky to get a lot of community support.
Also, Abby and I were recently in a parade. It was in the barangay of our host sister's mother-in-law, and it was the Santacruzan parade, which might have something to do with saints. In the case of the parade it was just a bunch of girls in ball gowns with lots of makeup walking all over town (in a typhoon). Did I mention we were hit by a typhoon? It was only signal 1 (the weakest) so all we had were 60 kmh winds and lot of rain, and an angry sea. It still flooded the low lying part of town, and apparently trashed our future host site. They had flooding, trees knocked down, etc. Nothing terribly severe, but it still caused a lot of damage. Abby and I are thinking we might geta 2nd story apartment. Haha. Anyway, the parade was really interesting, Abby was taken to a beauty parlor where they poofed and sprayed her hair mercilessly and covered her in makeup. They wanted to put makeup on me too, but I was able to avoid that. "Just a little lip shine!" they would say. No thanks.
So other than our project, we also have our barangay fiesta coming up, which involves a lot of videoke and eating, from what I understand. Everyone in town just makes a ton of food and then you walk to all of the houses of the people you know, and you eat and socialize. It sounds gut-bustalicious.
This is a picture of our island from the outrigger ferry boat. As you can see, it is an awesome island.
The girls in Santacruzan were anywhere from 6 to 18 or so. Here's Abby being peppered with questions.
Here's Abby in front of Tamaraw Falls on the way to Puerto Galera. It falls in a series of 7 different steps.
Here's Abby in the river, eating papaya and beans from the can. This was an outting with our host family.

It weighs about 2/3 as much, and is noticeably smaller in width and height, while being just a hair thicker.

By launching yourself to the owners the first few days their FSBO is announced, prior to the masses commence calling on Wednesday, you build a good interconnection. By mailing them resources, educational materials, free reviews, and forms, you become an ally. By using a personal curiosity about them in addition to their predicament, you produce a solid interconnection that, in many cases, pays off once the owners decide to go with an agent they know and trust preferably you actually.

It’s an awesome paragraph in favor of all the internet users; they will get benefit from it I am sure.
The root of your writing while sundniog reasonable in the beginning, did not really settle properly with me personally after some time. Someplace within the paragraphs you were able to make me a believer but only for a very short while. I nevertheless have got a problem with your leaps in logic and one would do well to fill in those gaps. When you can accomplish that, I could undoubtedly end up being impressed.
Hey I know this is off topic but I was wondering if you knew of any witegds I could add to my blog that automatically tweet my newest twitter updates. I’ve been looking for a plug-in like this for quite some time and was hoping maybe you would have some experience with something like this. Please let me know if you run into anything. I truly enjoy reading your blog and I look forward to your new updates.
What i don’t realize is in reltiay how you’re now not actually much more well-favored than you may be now. You are so intelligent. You already know therefore considerably in the case of this matter, made me for my part consider it from a lot of various angles. Its like women and men don’t seem to be fascinated until it’s one thing to accomplish with Lady gaga! Your own stuffs outstanding. Always maintain it up!
Thanks for sharing eleexlcnt informations. Your site is very cool. I am impressed by the details that you’ve on this site. It reveals how nicely you perceive this subject. Bookmarked this web page, will come back for more articles. You, my pal, ROCK! I found simply the info I already searched all over the place and simply couldn’t come across. What a great site.
Good post. I learn one thing more challenging on tltoaly different blogs everyday. It will always be stimulating to read content from different writers and observe a bit of one thing from their store. Ie28099d want to use some with the content on my weblog whether or not you done28099t mind. Natually Ie28099ll provide you with a link on your web blog. Thanks for sharing.
Thanks for your write-up. I would also like to remark that the first thing you will need to prrfoem is to see if you really need credit improvement. To do that you simply must get your hands on a copy of your credit report. That should really not be difficult, because government mandates that you are allowed to be issued one cost-free copy of your own credit report annually. You just have to inquire the right persons. You can either look at website owned by the Federal Trade Commission and also contact one of the leading credit agencies specifically.
The company founded in 1985, has total assets of RMB1.52 billion, occupies a total area of 800,000 square meters, and employs 3,000 staff members, including 98 senior engineers and technicians and 319 mid-level engineers and technicians.
I have really nocietd that credit restoration activity must be conducted with techniques. If not, chances are you’ll find yourself causing harm to your standing. In order to reach your goals in fixing your credit score you have to be careful that from this second you pay your complete monthly fees promptly in advance of their planned date. Really it is significant on the grounds that by not really accomplishing that, all other actions that you will decide to try to improve your credit standing will not be efficient. Thanks for giving your ideas.
Thanks for giving your ideas lstied here. The other matter is that when a problem occurs with a computer system motherboard, persons should not take the risk involving repairing this themselves for if it is not done right it can lead to permanent damage to the whole laptop. In most cases, it is safe just to approach any dealer of that laptop for your repair of motherboard. They’ve already technicians who definitely have an competence in dealing with pc motherboard issues and can have the right analysis and carry out repairs.
Thanks for the something toaltly new you have revealed in your text. One thing I want to discuss is that FSBO interactions are built over time. By releasing yourself to owners the first saturday and sunday their FSBO will be announced, ahead of the masses start off calling on Monday, you generate a good association. By sending them tools, educational elements, free records, and forms, you become an ally. By using a personal fascination with them plus their circumstance, you generate a solid link that, most of the time, pays off if the owners opt with a real estate agent they know as well as trust preferably you.

If a man were to get his weltanschaaung solely from the manosphere then he would most likely come to the conclusion that the world was populated by women who are either horny sluts, fat/obese women, Borderline Personality Disorder women, or traditional wives. Quite an eclectic mix I think you'll agree!
There's no doubt that these groups/types of women a) do exist, b) are worth talking about to a certain extent. But lets be honest, they don't constitute the whole population of womanhood in the Western world and you're not going to spend much of your life interacting with them. For instance, Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) women make up ~2% of the population, so the chances that you'll meet anyone with BPD in the first place are slim; let alone forming a long-term or sexual relationship with them (unless you're a serial dater of course). So reading blog after blog about BPD personality traits and such like truthfully doesn't make much sense except for the minority of men who know a woman with BPD.
A more sensible way would be to get a generalised overview on the multitude of personality types rather than learning every little idiosyncrasy about one or two specific personality types. Obviously all of us are going to have to deal with many different people types over our life time, whether we're socialites or social-reclusives, so having a vague familiarity with all of them would be better than knowing one personality type inside-and-out.
For example if any of you ever get into a long term relationship, or get hitched, then you may end up getting married to a frigid woman (like THIS guy). The frigid woman isn't a personality that isn't often mentioned amongst the (to use manosphere terms) bar-sluts, ameriskanks, fatties, hypergamous women and so on. Yet if you end up getting involved with a woman who suffers from frigidity (or Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder to use psychological jargon) it's almost certainly something that you would like to have read about, even if it was only a basic description.
This is why it's better to have an holistic overview of many personality types rather than a detailed view of a few personality types because it means that you will be able to deal better with them if/when you encounter them. And being able to see a multitude of personality types sure beats putting every woman you encounter into a handful of un-common ones. I mean, classifying everyone into simplistic 'geeks' and 'jocks' categories is something we gave up at school FFS!
But there is a good website which provides an overview of all psychological pathologies (like BPD and Manic-Depression, which women are more likely than men to suffer from) called - outofthefog.net - and it goes into detail about each disorder explaining its traits in laymans terms.

by alexcerballon February 17, 2017 October 28, 2017 5 Comments on Watching the Sunrise in Haleakala on Maui
You can hear about it, read about it, but nothing compares to seeing the sunrise over Haleakala in Maui. This dormant volcano is a sight to see, and you won’t be alone… hundreds of people from all over the world drive up here before first light, waiting to soak in the view. The summit’s elevation is 10,023 feet above sea level.
You’ll want to leave early, because there will be traffic. I stayed in Kihei and left at 2:45 in the morning, dressed in my warmest clothes and carrying the comforter from the hotel. You’ll have to make a reservation to enter this National Park to watch the sunrise. It’ll cost you $1.50, and you can make the reservation up to 60 days in advance. recreation.gov
The ride down felt completely different from the ride up. Before sunrise, you’re treated to the most amazing stargazing experience, and on the way down it feels like your traveling in between the clouds.
Don’t flock to where the crowds are, the viewing areas fill up fast, but I walked up a path and found a spot that was empty when I got there. Haleakala means “House of the Sun,” the crater is a valley carved by erosion.
There are no gas stations, so make sure you have a full tank if you’re driving here and remember you’ll need to pay an entrance fee at the park in addition to making the sunrise reservation. (Credit cards are accepted.)
Once the sun rises, take your time and explore Haleakala. Temperatures will start to warm up and when you walk around, you’ll be able to see the ocean and other views of Maui. If you’re not a morning person, you can come up here during the day or at sunset for another unique experience.
Share this experience with a loved one, family, children or friends, but you can also do it alone. I came up here solo since nobody wanted to wake up that early. No regrets at all, actually it was peaceful and you’re not really alone since there are hundreds of people there already. Do what I did, and befriend another solo traveler.
If your up for an adventure: try a downhill mountain biking tour, horseback riding in the park, or explore several trails in the area. Camping sites are also available.
Very pretty. I saw it too but I actually liked sunset even more. The sunrise is behind the crater, sunset is 180 degrees away from it. It was spectacular. I posted pictures of it in case you want to look.
So neat! I will have to check it out. Might be easier to get the boyfriend to join in the evening as opposed to the morning. haha.

In the second of a four-part series on India, Gerry Feehan visits the Taj Mahal and the blessed Ganges
The Taj Mahal in Agra, India, was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife Mumtaz Mahal. Constructed of ivory marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, the Taj Mahal is described as the world’s most perfect building. The Taj does not disappoint.
The grand mausoleum is best viewed in the early morning light, but some important foreign politico was in town so the grounds were closed to us plebeians. We had to view the edifice from Agra Fort, which lies across the Yamuna River.
Still, the ancient site in the hazy distance was stunning, with its four tall minarets framing the gigantic domed tomb.
In 1658, after a succession battle, Shah Jahan’s son had his father imprisoned in the fort. The elder Shah was forced to live out his existence with a distant, tantalizing, maddening view of his beloved wife’s final resting place.
The Taj Mahal grounds reopened to the great unwashed later in the afternoon – affording us the opportunity to avoid the morning crowd. As the sun set, we were able to quietly enjoy this architectural wonder with an intimate gathering of … about 10,000 souls. Did I mention India has a lot of people? (See Part 1 of the series.)
Every morning, before he could open his mouth to explain where we were going and what we’d see, eat and do that day, we’d greet our guide Anoop Singhal with a pre-emptive, “What’s the scoop, Anoop?” Then he’d regale us with the remarkable things we were to consume – visually and gastronomically – that day.
And throughout the adventure, with ceremonial kirpan rattling by his side, driver Devinder Singh navigated us safely through the byways of Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, his horn a constant presence, firmly announcing our arrival in every hamlet, village and town.
When we flew to Varanasi to visit the sacred waters of the Ganges, Singh Ji drove through the night, met us at the airport and safely delivered us to our luxurious accommodation.
It’s the desire of every devout Hindu to be cremated along the banks of the Ganges River, his ashes spread into the sacred water. Such a fortuitous departure from life enhances the deceased’s opportunity to be transported to heaven and escape the cycle of reincarnation, rebirth.
What we had seen on the way into town was a body, brightly wrapped in funerary attire, drawn in an open cart and bound for a wooden funeral pyre.
Late that afternoon, after navigating Varanasi’s warren-like alleyways and descending the stone steps of Manikarnika Ghat to the riverbank, we rowed quietly out into the soft Ganges current. Orange flames danced from a score of burning pyres, each mimicking the brilliant Indian sunset.
Downstream, supplicants released floating offerings of lit candles set in yellow marigolds, while men and women – pilgrims from all over India – stepped into the water to cleanse themselves and sip the holy elixir.
Despite encouragement from the locals, we didn’t partake in the ritual of drinking directly from the blessed Ganges. A Canadian doctor I met on a scenic point overlooking the river warned that to do so was to invite, “the 30-day, 30-pound diet.”
As darkness descended we drifted silently, watching a growing multitude of funerary blazes illuminate the shore. The effect was ethereal, apocalyptic.
In the morning, the mood at breakfast was somber. Our time with Mr. Singh and our wonderful guide Anoop was over. We were headed to Mumbai to begin the next leg of our journey. Before we left for the airport, Anoop Ji surprised us with a private yoga session in the garden of the Taj Gateway, our fabulous Varanasi hotel.
After a lot of “ohms,” some deep breathing and much stretching, the yogi insisted we finish the session with a laugh – literally. So we all forced a grin that morphed to a chuckle and eventually became a contagious guffaw. Soon the whole group was howling with a genuine, fall-on-your-yoga-mat belly laugh.

In the last week, news has come from U.S. Senators indicating that NESARAs announcement and the mass deliveries and fulfillment of the current prosperity programs are near.
There are some in Congress who support NESARA and support the distribution of the prosperity programs funds; both topics are under gag order or Non Disclosure but members of Congress do occasionally confide in their own family members and close personal friends. Although they are forced by U.S. Supreme Court gag order to publicly deny that NESARA has been passed, their personal conversations and communications are quite different.
While mainstream media carries make-news from the D.C. Bush gang, the real action is still happening behind the scenes and still under gag order. But not for long. Tomorrow I will write about something which, we hope, will provide crucial resolution to a problem which has been a major obstacle to the NESARA announcement. I have been tracking this obstacle for years and finally, it looks like a solution to remove the obstacle has been found.
When people read the major points of the true NESARA law listed above, most people will not realize the VAST impacts of NESARA. It is not until we detail NESARAs impacts on major organizations in our world, that we begin to realize the tremendous transformations NESARA initiates.
For example, what does the restoration of Constitutional Law really mean? Its been a few years since I have written about the impacts on certain organizations in the U.S. which will be required to change. There are literally thousands of ways NESARA impacts our country when Constitutional Law is restored. One of the thousands of ways involves the American Bar Association (ABA) which will be required to cease functioning under its CURRENT charter in the U.S. The reason for this is that the ABA is an organization whose official charter was authorized by the British Crown. The British Crown is a foreign agent and this makes the current ABA a foreign agent which has power the Constitution prohibits a foreign agent to have. Through various means the ABA has spread its tentacles of control into our legal and judicial system, government, and Congress. The ABA is controlled by the Illuminati/dark agenda and is one of the ways the Illuminati have gained covert control in the U.S.
The American Medical Association and the American Dental Association are also tools of the Illuminati and will have to cease functioning under their current charters. The Illuminati have very carefully step-by-step taken control of our country in a myriad of covert activities and through many organizations. We are currently blocked from accessing many helpful alternative medical technologies and therapies due to restrictions by government and these Illuminati controlled organizations.
All of these organizations, the ABA, the AMA, and the ADA, are controlled by the Illuminati and have been used to control our people in various ways. In addition, the Illuminati have their tentacles into well-known charitable organizations, foundations, universities, media conglomerates, corporations, and much more. NESARA requires changes in the structures and charters of literally every organization; the changes NESARA requires will enable the Illuminatis personnel and control to be identified and removed.
The reason that NESARA is under such strict gag orders by both the World Court and the U.S. Supreme Court is due to NESARAs massive ripple effects. What happens when someone perceives that their power or income will be impacted by a new law? If people perceive they have less power or that their incomes might become less, they band together and raise objections to the new law.
With NESARA, there will be less attorneys needed for several reasons: 1) there will be no federal income tax and eventually no state income taxes which eliminates need for tax attorneys; 2) there will be radically fewer laws because NESARA wipes out many laws. If NESARA had not been passed in secret sessions, there would have been years of fighting by attorneys to keep NESARA from passing.
There are provisions in NESARA to compensate these attorneys and all others whose income is reduced by NESARA, but this probably would not have kept attorneys from lobbying against NESARA. In addition, there is the new prosperity program for all U.S. citizens and natural persons/sovereigns which is part NESARA and will be announced within a month or so of NESARAs announcement. However, most people who have had significant power and income will fight against something they perceive as limiting them. If NESARA had not been kept secret, NESARA would have been bogged down for decades in fights and attempts to water it down. The only solution to this was to pass NESARA secretly and keep the gag orders on NESARA until the official announcement.
And theres more reasons why it has to be done this way. There are literally THOUSANDS of LIES which the government and others have spread and which most Americans believe to be true. However, the U.S. Supreme Court and those who contributed to writing NESARA were given irrefutable evidence which proves the government and media have spread a vast web of lies for decades as part of tricking and controlling the American people. The Justices realized it would be impossible for the public to understand WHY NESARA was so desperately needed when the American public has been brainwashed into believing a huge web of lies. The Justices also knew that they would only be able to educate the public AFTER the true NESARA law is announced because major media conglomerates are owned by the Illuminati. Only after NESARA is announced will the Illuminatis power to withhold the truth be ended.
The average attorney, doctor, dentist, corporate executive, and others who might have tried to fight NESARA are equally as deluded as most other Americans. Most of the American population does not know, for example, that the Federal Reserve is a PRIVATE corporation owned largely by FOREIGN bankers and has been part of the great federal income tax swindle since the beginning. The IRS acts as the bully-boy to coerce payment of the unlawful federal income tax and guess where the money goes? The majority of it goes to the Federal Reserve and the Queen of England.
What you may ask does the Queen of England have to do with it? It happens that there was an agreement made by the Founding Fathers to buy independence from the British Crown in order to end the Revolutionary War. The Founding Fathers worried that the British would continue to send British troops to the colonies and bloody war would drag out for years. To end the killing, the Founding Fathers agreed to pay the British Crown for a number of years. In their usual trickery, the Illuminati have forced the agreement to be extended far beyond the years agreed upon and also have increased the amount of money paid to the British Crown. Each year, the British Crown makes payments out of these funds stolen (via unlawful income tax) from Americans to the top Illuminati families. The truth about this and thousands of other Illuminati actions will come out in vast numbers of exposes after NESARA is announced.
The federal income tax money paid to the Federal Reserve is paid on the bogus debt owed to the Federal Reserve for interest and fees charged in managing the banking and monetary system. The whole issue of the U.S. government owing money to the Federal Reserve is another complex Illuminati scam wrapped up in convoluted, unconstitutional laws and financial transactions designed to increase the debt. The majority of the national debt is actually due to these bogus debts owed to the Federal Reserve and NESARA wipes out the bogus debts. Because NESARAs new U.S. Treasury Bank System is based on NEW money which has come into the U.S. after being accumulated offshore and which is backed by gold, silver, and platinum, there will be no economic problems from wiping out the majority of the bogus national debt.
Ive touched on many complex issues today and ALL these issues are much more complex than Ive discussed. Im using these issues as illustrations of why NESARA had to be passed secretly and why it will be under gag order until the official announcement. I hope this helps you to understand a little about the complexities involved.

2019 Chevrolet Cruze CVT Review & Changes – Possessing sold 171,552 cases in the calendar year 2019 in sedan and hatchback styles, the Cruze prepares to enter the 2019 model year with the all-new transmission. The six-speed manual that’s currently provided as standard is going the way of the dodo with respect to a document posted by GM with the Federal Highway Traffic Safety Management, and in its place, a continuously variable transmission (CVT) could have to make do.
Discovered by The Real Truth About Cars, the document has nevertheless to be verified by General Motors, though the creating is on the wall surface for the stick transfer. After all, the row-your-own gearbox has a small fanbase in the United States. What is a lot more, a CVT is far more comfortable for everyday use.
Torque-Converter automatic transmission troopers on for 2019, and it will probably be provided on choose models. The diesel-powered Cruze with the Opel-created 1.6-liter CDTi will continue to rely on the nine-speed Hydra-Matic 9T50 that created its debut in the 2019 Chevrolet Malibu Premier.
What’s new in the powertrain department is the CNG-capable 1.4-liter turbocharged engine and the 1.5-liter four-cylinder that acts as the entry-level alternative in the Malibu. With 160 horsepower and 184 pound-feet on the faucet, it is more than satisfactory for a compact-sized car like the Cruze. For those who mourn the reduction of the manual, TTAC shows that “stick change acquire charges in North America hover in the low single-digit range.” And what is far more, there are a number of other compact vehicles available with manual transmissions, including the accolade-succeeding Subaru Impreza.

Okay so the game is a foot...and a hand...and whatever got blasted over the hill...anyways, now that we know the rules, what do you guys think?
Think 5 Kill Points is a little high, should have been like 2. Mostly standard rules, night fight on a pitch battle for round one is interesting.
I think they made a mistake here. They should have the deployment zone objectives are worth one point, but they said your table quarter. Does this mean my opponents table quarter is worth 0?
Outflanking and Infiltrate rules cannot be used....interesting. Also, night fighting on Turn 6....okay?
The double the points on the general is going to be harsh on some people. Probably not going to see the Nightbringer or Deceiver

​We are excited to share with you the new ARDMS® logo! Our new logo was designed to honor the ARDMS’ long history, celebrate our Registrants, symbolize the field of sonography and represent our mission of quality patient care through the certification and continuing competency of ultrasound professionals.
The reveal of our new logo corresponds with the exciting news that the ARDMS has expanded its organizational structure and governance model to better meet the needs of diverse healthcare professionals around the world. On January 1, 2016, the ARDMS launched an umbrella company (Inteleos™) and a physician-centric certification community (Alliance for Physician Certification and Advancement™ - APCA™) which joined the ARDMS in furthering its long-standing vision of raising the global standards of excellence in healthcare and patient safety. The new structure will be implemented by June 2016 and more information may be found at www.ARDMS.org/2016NewStructure.
The new organizational structure also allows the ARDMS to recommit to solely serve Sonographers. Our Registrants will continue to count on the ARDMS for unparalleled credentialing opportunities, exceptional service and to champion the role and voice of Sonographers around the world.
The new ARDMS logo serves to celebrate the ARDMS as the guiding star in our new organizational structure. Additionally, the 10 rays symbolize the number of exams the ARDMS currently offers. Some of the rays are also designed to represent sound and sound transmission (transducers) in an aspirational form. Other rays represent our Registrants and how the ARDMS aspires to elevate Sonographers and the practice of ultrasound through certification. Finally, the orange circle at the center of our logo represents the patient. This final piece of symbolism was important as patients are at the heart of the ARDMS and the ultimate beneficiary of our mission to promote quality patient care through the certification and continuing competency of ultrasound professionals.
Please look for the new ARDMS logo as we begin incorporating it on ARDMS materials over the coming year.

It is set in 1757, during the French and Indian War, and tells the story of transportation of the two daughters of Colonel Munro, Alice and Cora, from the upper New York wilderness to a safe destination.

Her name is Dinah. In the Bible, her fate is merely hinted at in a brief and violent detour within the verses of the "Book of Genesis" that recount the life of Jacob and his infamous dozen sons. THE RED TENT is an extraordinary and engrossing tale of ancient womanhood and family honour. Told in Dinah's voice, it opens with the story of her mothers - the four wives of Jacob - each of whom embodies unique feminine traits, and concludes with Dinah's own startling and unforgettable story of betrayal, grief and love. Deeply affecting and intimate, THE RED TENT combines outstandingly rich storytelling with an original insight into women's society in a fascinating period of early history and such is its warmth and candour, it is guaranteed to win the hearts and minds of women across the world.
Praise for In Due Season «Paul Wilkes's memoir is a love story—and also a story of a struggle with the lover, in his case, God. The son of an immigrant, Wilkes felt that he was called to a priestly vocation, indeed a Trappist vocation. God sent him many signals that this was not his calling. So Paul had to settle for what he thought to be a second-best vocation—a very successful writer. God heaved a sigh of relief. Paul had finally 'got it.' He has written a memoir of the century.» —Andrew Greeley, author, The Catholic Imagination «Paul Wilkes is that rarest of people—a deeply spiritual man who is also an absolutely exquisite writer. His absorbing new memoir reveals the wonderful things that can happen when you allow God to lead you along life's often bumpy path—whether or not you know where the journey will lead. This is a beautifully written, frequently haunting, and always fascinating story of seeking and finding, serving and loving, and—ultimately—dying and rising. Highly recommended.» —James Martin, SJ, author, My Life with the Saints «Paul Wilkes's biography takes us through Paul's life, but through the stages of our own lives as well. As a result, at the end of it we can see how we, too, have become more than we ever thought we could be. Wilkes is a great writer–he has a refreshing style, a direct voice, and a stark and unfurbished honesty, even about himself. In Due Season has all the marks of Augustine's Confessions or Merton's Seven Storey Mountain. It gives the rest of us, whatever we've done, wherever we've been, hope. It helps us see the forest of our lives despite the trees. Read this book. It can put the seasons of your own life into better, broader perspective.» —Joan Chittister, author, Called to Question: A Spiritual Memoir Paul Wilkes' In Due Season takes the reader on a moving journey through an extraordinary era's thickets of American Catholic life and belief—opening at last into wisdom, affirmation, and hope. —James Carroll, author, Practicing Catholic and An American Requiem, winner of the National Book Award
Epic in scope, intimate in detail, heartbreaking in its human drama, this is the first book to recount the history of the nobility caught up the maelstrom of the Bolshevik Revolution and the creation of Stalin’s Russia. It is a book filled with chilling tales of looted palaces, burning estates, of desperate flights from marauding thugs and Red Army soldiers, of imprisonment, exile, and execution. It is the story of how a centuries-old elite famous for its glittering wealth, its service to the Tsar and Empire, was dispossessed and destroyed along with the rest of old Russia. Drawing on the private archives of two great families – the Sheremetovs and the Golitsyns – Former People is also a story of survival, of how many of the tsarist ruling class, so-called “former people” and “class enemies,” abandoned, displaced, and repressed, overcame the loss of their world and struggled to find a place for themselves and their families in the new, hostile world of the Soviet Union. It reveals how even at the darkest depths of the terror, daily life went on—men and women fell in love, children were born and educated, friends gathered, simple pleasures were cherished. Ultimately, Former People is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit.

But Slope is a snake in the grass, determined to find a rich wife, to win advancement for himself, even to fight Mrs Proudie if necessary. Their battle becomes a furious dance, involving rich, pretty Widow Bold, angry Archdeacon Grantly, man-eating Signora Neroni, gentle Mr Harding, confused Parson Quiverful and his fourteen noisy children. This classic comic story is Trollope's most famous novel.

Drawing us into a world of devotion, the tales allow us to taste the bliss that comes from a life lived from the very center of one's self. Each story comes alive in joy and produces a «holy shiver» that speaks to the soul.

Today his company, Patagonia, earns more than $600 million a year and is a beacon and benchmark for sustainable capitalism.

Seollal "Lunar New Year" is approaching, so Clark and I thought we'd hit COSTCO today to stock up. We left Logan at home with the nanny and headed off to Seoul a little before noon. It was a nice sunny day, no rain, no fog, no snow, yet along the 20km stretch of highway we passed no less than FOUR car accidents (a testament to the oh so talented and cautious driving skills of Koreans).
Anyone who's ever been to a COSTCO in Korea can tell you that it's pretty much a nightmare, but we're gluttons for punishment and go back time and time again. Actually, it wasn't so bad today ~ weekdays are much preferable to weekends. The parking lot queue was only 30min instead of the usual 50+min, and while trying to maneuver through the aisles, was only hit twice that I can recall (as opposed to the usual battering I suffer).
Yes, we like to shop here, but the thing we love best about COSTCO is the food court. Of course, any foreigner knows the ketchup, mustard, relish, and onions are provided as condiments for anyone buying a hot dog, alas, no one's ever bothered to tell this to a Korean. The parking/shopping/checkout fiasco is always worth it in the end just to see everyone eating their ketchup-mustard-relish-onion salads.
This woman has decided on "condiment upside-down salad" and has thoughtfully arranged her ketchup, mustard, and relish onto her plate before grinding her onions.
And these people subscribe to the mantra "who needs mustard and relish when you've got a heaping pile of ground raw onions and ketchup!?"
The lack of clarity and confusion that too often results when speaking with Koreans never ceases to amaze me. I used to think maybe something was just lost in translation, but Clark assures me this is not so and that it's an unfortunate sociolinguistic phenomenon. Korean language is just far more non-specific than English and, in my experience, Koreans do not share in the western definition of "logic" or "time".
To illustrate, here are two telephone conversations I had this week with two different recruiters calling about p/t work they wanted me to do. Keep in mind that these are REAL conversations (transcribed to the best of my recollection) with REAL people:
Me: (chuckling) That's it, a job every Saturday? Is there anything else you can tell me about the position?
Me: (chuckling slightly harder) You still haven't told me very much. Where is it? What's the schedule? How much does it pay?
R: It's in Suwon, of course. (oh sure, of course, how silly of me not to have intuited this. my bad.)
R: Ms. Harrison? Hello. I'm looking at your resume now and I'm impressed by your experience. You have a lot of corporate and university experience.
R: So, it says you live in Suwon. Do you still live in Suwon? (no, I moved to Busan, but thought it'd be cute to write Suwon on my resume)
R: How long have you lived in Korea? (is he really looking at my resume because the answer is there in black and white)
R: Oh really!? You have F2 visa? (ok, there's no way this guy could actually be looking at my resume)
R: Ok. Good. Very good. The client wants to meet you before the class starts. When do you have time this week? (he's calling on Friday afternoon)
R: But the client wants to meet you before the class. They want to have a class starting Monday. (perhaps you should've thought to call earlier?)
Me: Well, I'm sorry. It's already the end of the week and I'm not available on the weekend. If the client has Skype, I'd be happy to talk to them that way, or you could give them my number and they could call me.
Me: Like I said, I'm not able to meet this weekend. I guess you'll have to try finding someone else. Sorry.
Me: Yes, I know. I'm available to start the class on Monday. (why am I always trying to circumnavigate conversations like this?)
Today we were invited to spend the afternoon with a fellow expat family (from England) at a local kid's cafe called 'Little Prince'.
I've never been to anything of the sort before and was rather impressed. There's a 6000won (about $5.50) entrance fee, but they didn't charge us because Logan is so young and unable to make use of much yet. They have a wide selection of toys, a trampoline room, ball pit, slide, jungle gym, carousel, and train. They also have a small library and a costume closet (there were quite a few princesses and supermans running around today).
They served pretty decent food, though it was a little pricey. We had pork cutlet and teriyaki chicken pilaf. Matthew (UK dad) told us that lately he's been going there with his daughter almost every day and is a huge fan of the coffee they serve. He had THREE triple shot coffees while we were there!
It was Logan's first time to socialize with other kids and definitely something I think we're going to start doing a lot more of. One little girl, in particular, took a shine to him.
Clark took Logan for a train ride. It was hard to get a good picture because the train was moving surprisingly fast!
Then Bubby chilled out in this rocking chair and it wasn't long before he fell asleep. I guess all the excitement wore him out.
It's official, I'm old. Too old, at least, to understand the fashion choices of Korean youth. The average daytime high for January has been around -7C with lows as bitter as -17C, so why are young women prancing around in shorts? Shorts! Here's a 21 year-old student of mine arriving for class at 8am this morning sans hat, gloves, winter coat, and (of all things) pants. The only thing 'winter' about her outfit is the scarf. Of my 5 female students, 2 of them regularly wear shorts & mini skirts year-round. When I ask them if they're cold, they reply "that's ok". I haven't quite deciphered if "that's ok" translates to "I'm not cold" or "I'm cold, but it doesn't matter because I'm so fashion conscious that I'd rather freeze to death and chance sickness than dress warmly and look like an old fart (like you do teacher)". I think it's probably the latter.
And speaking of old farts, I have a lot of time every morning while waiting at the bus stop to people watch and am bewildered by the number of 'older' people (anyone over 25, really) who think it important to protect their faces but not their heads. My mornings are a sea of surgical masks and bare heads. Are winter hats just a Canadian thing?
Today was my first day volunteering at a local orphanage in Suwon through a non-profit organization called Program REACH. The program was started over a year ago by a group of expats, but I only recently found out about it. I got the idea to do some volunteer work a few months ago, so I Googled and was pleasantly surprised to find this right in our neighbourhood.
I teach English to three kids for an hour on Sunday afternoons. There are about 10 volunteers; half teach Wednesday evenings and the other half on Sundays. We share the same kids - the three I teach on Sundays, someone else teaches on Wednesdays, thus we have to coordinate a bit.
They're middle school students and super low level. They mostly want to communicate in Korean; so I'm doing my best to teach them in a mix of basic English and mangled Korean.
Today we played Sight Word BINGO and another game I downloaded from eslprintables.com (an awesome English teaching materials exchange site I’m a member of).
It's a Korean/British chain of retail stores jointly owned by Samsung & Tesco. It’s the second largest retailer in South Korea (Emart is #1) and is basically like Wal-Mart. (Actually, in the late 1990s Wal-Mart tried and failed to penetrate the Korean market and was turned into Emart - but that’s another story).
Suwon has two of each (Homeplus & Emart); we shop at Homeplus because it’s practically next door. We spend an exceedingly large amount of our time there (we go at least twice a week), and I was recently embarrassed to find myself telling my students that it's my favourite place to shop, which doesn't exactly make me look cool to a group of 18-24 year-olds.
Koreans are very fond of gochi "skewered food". Here we have some o-daeng "fish sausage" kebabs, which repulsed me once upon a time but has since grown on me.
Here's a variety of skewered fish and pork sausages. The giant ones in the front are, in fact, french fry coated hotdogs.
And my personal favourite - chicken skewers (but you have to be careful which one you choose; I steer clear of the hearts, feet, and rectums^^)
The Homeplus near us is 5 floors. Groceries are on the second floor and is where we spend the majority of our time. I was too lazy to go and take any pictures of the other floors, so food pictures is all you get.
This is my father's favourite section - the wall of tofu. Whenever he visits, he begs me to buy copious amounts of tofu that he can eat for weeks on end. Right Dad?
And here we have my mother's favourite - the seafood section. They have quite a vast selection. I sometimes amuse myself by prodding random creatures and watching them wiggle; the shellfish are usually the most amusing (honestly).
Most Koreans are incredulous when I try and explain that Canadians would only feed this stuff to their cats. To them, dried seafood (squid and anchovies in particular) are perfectly delicious snacks. Dried, buttered squid is especially popular at the movies.
Seafood is so well-liked it's even a chip flavour. Sae-woo-gang "shrimp flavoured chips" is one of Clark's favourite snacks.
One of the best things about Homeplus is all the free food samples. Here's Clark testing the bulgogi "marinated beef".
We always stop for ddeok-bokki and twi-gim "spicy rice cakes and tempura". A minor argument ensued immediately after this photo was taken because Clark neglected to include the sweet potato tempura (which we get every single time because it's my favourite, so I could not understand how/why he forgot).
I mustn't forget to include the ramen aisle (actually, there are two). If there's anything Koreans love more than dried squid, it's instant noodles! Clark and I once saw a tv program about a 50-something-year-old Korean man who has subsisted entirely on ramen since he was in his 20's.
The bakery. Not worth your time unless you're partial to sweet potatoes, walnuts, or red beans. Typical western-style goodies (chocolate or fruit flavoured) are hard to be found.
And lastly, one of the perks of shopping at Homeplus is being helped by people in amusing uniforms. The gloves I understand, even the scarf I get, but I have yet to deduce the utility of the white leg thingys. Are they shoe covers? Leg warmers? Shin guards?
I'm teaching some morning classes during winter break at the school where Clark works and noticed this place across the street today.
It was immediately evident that they weren't serving western-style hotdogs from the hangul "Korean alphabet characters" 보신탕 (bo-shin-tang); bo-shin translates to 'body strengthening/protecting' and tang means 'soup'. Put it all together and you've got 'dog meat soup'.
Consumption of dog meat is a long-standing tradition in Korea that has fallen out of fashion with the younger generations and is, in fact, illegal now (though that doesn't seem to be deterring anyone). Those who do it eat, do so primarily for its supposed health benefits and aphrodisiac properties.
Clark has eaten it a handful of times in his younger years and describes the meat as "tender, but stinky and greasy". As for me, I'm more than happy to abstain.
"Baby frog fish" is the expression Clark once used upon spotting a tadpole and not knowing the English term.
I was reminded of this (cute Clarkism) today while parking the car after returning from Homeplus. As I was backing into the space, my rear wheels nudged the rubber parking curb a little more aggressively than intended, at which point the following conversation ensued:
And herein lies the problem; I'm losing my English vocabulary! Before writing this post, I had to Google "rubber in parking lot" which subsequently led me to the phrase "rubber parking curb" (used above). 34 years-old and I can't remember the word 'curb'. Not good.
My inability to recall English words seems to be occurring with greater frequency and resulting in asinine conversations like the one above. I guess this is what inevitably happens when you live in a foreign country for an extended period of time without the company of friends who speak the same language (natively). If I stop to ponder for a moment, I have to admit that my English is riddled with Konglish expressions, flawed grammar, and gaping vocabulary holes. Perhaps I should invest in some native English-speaking friends?
It’s probably not a good idea to resolve to do too much. If I write down everything I hope to accomplish this year, I’m likely to disappoint or embarrass myself, so I’m keeping my list modest.
Travel. It’s very depressing to look back on last year and realize we didn’t go anywhere (because I was pregnant?). Very regrettable. We’ve definitely got to go somewhere this year.
See my sister. It’s been so long I don’t even remember the last time; 6 years at least (think more). Clark's never even met her!
Be a good mother. This year is going to be chock-full of important milestones and I imagine that with proper parenting skills, I can help Logan reach all of them: sitting up, eating solids, crawling, walking, talking, etc.
Rejoin the workforce. I haven’t had a ‘regular’ job in six months and I miss it. I like working. I’ve done my fair share of temping in the last couple of months, but I want to contribute more to our household income and get back into full-time teaching. I’m looking forward to my new job starting in March.
Cook more. My mother cooked 2-3 meals a day for us when she was here last fall. I average about 1. I’m pretty good about making Clark’s lunchboxes (he loves pastas & stir-frys), but I haven’t been cooking as many ‘family’ meals as I probably should. I want to bake more, too (easier said than done in Korea, where baking supplies & ingredients aren’t what one would call 'abundant').
It’s probably better to say that I’ve matured rather than admit that I’m now just plain boring. When I returned to Korea in 2006, I did this:
Here I am (behind the camera) downtown at Boshingak “bell pavilion” with a few good friends in a manic crowd of several hundred thousand, no doubt drunk, and secretly praying I don’t catch on fire.
Now fast forward 4 years to this New Year’s Eve. After eating at a (very crowded) shabu-shabu restaurant, we put Logan to bed, gobbled up a freshly baked apple crisp, cracked open a bottle of champagne (my first taste of alcohol in over a year) and watched “When Harry Met Sally”. Things certainly do change ~ *sigh*.
We had visitors on New Year’s Day. Clark’s parents, grandmother & aunt (on his mother’s side) came over with a ton of mandu “dumplings”. For those who haven’t read my Favourite Winter Food post, eating mandu is a New Year’s (both Solar & Lunar) tradition in Korea. According to popular superstition, a person does not become a year older until they’ve eaten mandu in some form or another; usually served in beef broth soup. Regardless of actual birthday, everyone turns a year older on January 1.
Koreans (and a few other East Asian countries, I think) count a person’s age differently from the rest of the world whereby a newborn is considered 1 year-old at the time of birth and each passing of a new year adds another year. Thus, Logan (who is 4 months-old) is now magically 2 years-old!﻿

Tapeworms live in the digestive tracts of vertebrates as adults and often in the bodies of various animals as juveniles. In a tapeworm infection, adults absorb food predigested by the host, so the worms have no need for a digestive tract or a mouth. Large tapeworms are made almost entirely of reproductive structures with a small "head" for attachment. Symptoms vary widely, depending on the species causing the infection. The largest tapeworms can be 20 m or longer. Tapeworm awareness is importance to humans because they infect people and livestock. Two important tapeworms are the pork tapeworm and the beef tapeworm
This campaign, “Give a Beep”, is for Hövding, which is a company that created the world’s first inflatable “airbag helmet” for bicyclists. This campaign is focused on increasing brand awareness in London. To accomplish this, the company modified the bicycle bell, so that when bicyclists feel unsafe, they can ring the bell. When someone rings the bell, it sends an email to the Mayor stating that they feel unsafe as a bicyclist. One of the reasons for this campaign’s success is due to its ease, as users only have to ring a bell; social media and email alerts are automatically sent out. It also resonates with a problem that London is currently facing, which is bicycle safety.hovding-giveabeep-webby-awards

NME is one of the world’s largest music magazines needed to speak to Brazilian music fans. NME transformed the sound waves of the song tracks presented on Soundcloud into a completely new form of media. They designed a font that could be read on the waves and created a design with the sound waves letter by letter, composing a soundtrack for each letter. With the alphabet, They wrote an ad for NME and put it right before songs by Brazil’s main Indie bands.
With the Internet of Things expected to comprise 30 billion connected devices by 2020, one of the most exciting areas of focus today is now on nanosensors capable of circulating in the human body or being embedded in construction materials. Once connected, this Internet of Nanothings could have a huge impact on the future of medicine, architecture, agriculture and drug manufacture.
So I’m not a huge fan of science, mainly because I find it quite tedious, but I like plants and thought this new tech is extremely cool! Basically the biggest issue we face right now with harvesting energy from natural resources (sun, wind, water, etc.) is that we run into issues when it comes to storing that energy; however, the western swordfern is apparently like a natural battery, as it has an extremely dense network of veins, so combined with a newfound electrode it stores energy.
Anyways, I thought it was pretty cool and it would definitely come in handy in the future. Plant Inspired Tech Could be a Step Towards Self-Powered Phones
This is really interesting because it looks pretty dumb, but creativity and workflow are proven to be increased by movement and physical interactions, so I wonder what the office will look like in a decade beyond just treadmills.

Whether your gymnast has just started tumbling or you have an experienced tumbler at home, you and they will benefit from having gymnastics mats at home. The truth of the matter is a gymnast is never still and soon most of the furniture in your home will be used as an apparatus! Unfortunately, unlike the gym, a home’s floors aren’t cushioned or very forgiving. If you have a gymnastics mat available to cushion falls, you will be able to encourage your gymnast to practice without getting bruises or potentially getting hurt.
Many people wonder how a gymnast will use a mat at home. The truth is these mats are multi-purpose and can be used for much more than just basic tumbling practice. For instance, your gymnast will love their mat to practice basic tumbling like rolls, walkovers, handstands, and even cartwheels.
Mats will be used by advanced gymnasts to practice standing back tucks and front tucks too. A home gymnastics mat is also perfect for slumber parties, general horseplay, and mom can even use it for yoga practice.
If you are considering buying a gymnastics mat for use at home, you need to make several considerations before making a purchase. Below, we have listed the most important features of home mats to consider to help you get the mat you need and want.
A mat that is too thin won’t provide the cushioning and protection you want if your gymnast falls while tumbling on it. On the other hand, if the mat is too thick, your gymnast may not be able to practice stunts because their hands or feet will sink into the mat when they aren’t supposed to. Standard mat thickness is about 1 3/8” thick.
Before buying a mat, you need to think about where your gymnast will use it. You also want to make sure it is big enough for a gymnast to practice stunts on. Since mats are offered in a variety of different sizes, it shouldn’t be hard to find a happy medium that fulfills both needs.
There are many different types of mats to choose from when it comes to home use. The most popular mat types are described in detail below.
One of the most popular gymnastics mats used in the gym and homes are paneled mats. Paneled mats are offered in many different colors and fold up for easy storage. This type of gymnast mat is offered in many different sizes. The most popular size is 4 feet wide by 8 feet long. This type of mat usually has Velcro attached on the ends, so more mats can be added to create a longer mat. Paneled mats are also often referred to as folded mats. Whether the mat you are considering is a folding mat or tumbling mat, it offers the same benefits and is usually offered in the same lengths and thicknesses.
The Tumbl Trak Folding Gymnastics Mat is our most favorite paneled/folded mat. It has just enough padding for tumbling, no slip, easily folds up and connects together if you have multiple units, it’s just perfect.
To allow your gymnast to perform a series of elements together, EXTRA LENGTH mats might be a better option. Make sure you have a proper room for the size. Check out this one for a 10 or 12 feet long mat: Z-Athletic Gymnastics & Exercise Folding Mat, you can pick the size.
A cartwheel beam mat is a great home mat option for a beginner or young gymnast. The mat is created with proper hand and feet placement that guides gymnasts in the proper way to do a cartwheel. Even after the gymnast has perfected the cartwheel, the mat can be used to practice handstands and handstand rolls. Most cartwheel beam mats have a beam option as well. To use the beam option simply flip the mat over and you will find a practice beam. With this matted practice beam, a gymnast can practice beam balance skills and other skills that are normally performed on the beam.
The Tumbl Trak Cartwheel Beam Mat is best for beginner gymnasts. It has two sides guides for practice, hands and feet on one side and beam-line on the other side. It also has a more variety of colors to choose from.
A carpeted or flexi-roll mat is made to look and feel like a competition floor. Of course, it doesn’t offer exactly the same feel because it isn’t created with springs, but it is the best option for those that want to get comfortable with the feel of a competition floor at home. The best thing about a carpeted mat is that it can be rolled up and stored with ease.
An incline mat is perfect for young gymnasts that are learning how to do rolls backwards or forwards. This type of mat can also be used for log rolls too. The great thing about an incline mat is it helps a gymnast create body awareness and lessens stress on the body while learning. It’s not recommended for advanced gymnasts to use an incline mat for harder skills because of the risk of injury. If a gymnast is looking for a gymnastics mat for home use designed for more difficult skills, it’s better to purchase a larger incline mat.
Contrary to the name, gymnastics mats are not just for gymnast. In fact, this type of mat can come in handy for many sports and activities. For instance, wrestlers, dancers, and cheerleaders can make use of a gymnastic mat in their home. The most popular type of mat for a wrestler, dancer, cheerleader, and gymnast to use in the same home would be a folded or paneled mat. Since paneled and folded gymnastics mats can be fastened together to make a larger surface, they are perfect for use for many different activities
A good gymnastics mat is going to cost a small investment but the benefits will quickly outweigh the costs. Even with hard daily wear, a good quality mat can be expected to last a very long time. One of the best things about this type of mat is that it is easy to care for as well. To clean a mat, you simply need to use a wet cloth and water to allow to dry. If you want to sanitize the mat, you can use a soft cloth and your favorite sanitizer to keep the mat germ free.
One of the best ways to encourage your gymnast to practice at home is to gift him or her with a quality mat. Take the time to get exactly what you need and you’ll never be disappointed with your purchase.

How do you learn to love again when you have lost the love of your life? The idea of being with another, doing the same things you did with the love that has passed, doesn’t feel right? Do you have to reinvent yourself in order to start over?

You asked Coach Allana Pratt: My wife of almost 14 years as of September 23, 2014 had passed away. Is it common for a widower to feel like he can never or ever will be able to touch, kiss or make love to another woman like he did to his passed love? Because that is we’re I’m at with it all. I can’t see myself doing the things I did with my wife to any other woman. It’s like I have to be a whole new man and learn from the beginning again and I don’t want to change who I am.
Symptoms are not our foes but our friends. They are inviting us to pay attention to imbalances and illness and to heal.
Healing requires relationship; it is the relationship between patient and practitioner that reveals what needs to be healed and the best medicines and interventions to effect this change.
Stress is a necessary, and even positive part, of life. It is its chronicity and severity that takes a toll on one’s health.
Nature heals. Getting in touch with nature both outdoors and our own inner nature brings about much solace and healing. Natural remedies help one’s nature to unfold and come into bloom.
Life and learning are inextricably linked. As a physician, I am continually working to learn more to be of help to my patients. Moving towards a life of optimal health involves learning new things about oneself and a new way of relating to/being in the world.
Details matter. We are each a rich fabric of many experiences, emotions, challenges and stressors. Getting to the root cause(s) of dis-ease requires a careful accounting of, and sifting through one’s biographical and biological history.
Change is constant. A sign of a healthy body and mind is one that can readily adapt to change. Effective medicine stays abreast of change and combines ancient wisdom with modern science.
Systems and structures can be freeing. I use these to keep my left brain occupied and on track so that my right brain to tap into intuition and into the emotional and psychological realms when I work clinically. For patients, systems and structures help to create rhythms and routines that promote and maintain health.
Nothing is worse than your HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) system breaking down, especially if you live in New Jersey. We all know how the weather can be here, and let’s just say we need our HVAC systems to work properly. That being said, HVAC systems do have an expiry date (like most things) and there comes a time (inevitably) when they should be replaced with newer, better versions.
HVAC replacement can be expensive, which is why a lot of people choose to put it off until it becomes unavoidable. However, delaying an expense doesn’t make it avoidable. There are signs you should be looking for in order to know when it’s time to replace your HVAC system, as old HVAC systems can be harmful for your health.
All HVAC manufacturers state that appliances should be replaced at the end of the expected life of the product. On an average, heating systems such as boilers and furnaces should be replaced after a period of fifteen to twenty years, whereas air conditions should be replaced after a decade.
HVAC systems work best under the given life expectancy of the appliance. If your system is old, it is time to replace it. Installing an efficient HVAC system can bring down the cost of your bill by 20%.
Old HVAC systems are not that efficient, which means it will take a longer period of time to heat up or cool down a given space, which results in higher energy costs.
Old furnaces and air conditioners break down the most during their last two years. So if you find yourself repairing a new part every month then it is a sign that you should replace it.
If it feels that one room of the house is cold whereas the other is hot, it’s because HVAC system is unable to maintain a consistent temperature and should be replaced.
Appliances have a tendency to make a lot of rattling and banging noise towards the end. If your furnace’s blower is running excessively, gives out cool air, and consistently turns on and off, you know for sure that it is old.
If your burner flame is yellow instead of blue, then there is a possibility that the furnace is creating carbon monoxide which is harmful for you. Moist surfaces (such as windows and walls), soot around the furnace, and excessive rusting are signs that there is a presence of harmful gas. Other than this, if you or your family members are experiencing constant nausea, headaches, hallucinations, mood swings, and burning sensation in the eyes, this may be due to Carbon Monoxide.
If you feel that your house is dry and stuffy, and you constantly face problems such as allergies, dry skin, dry throat, static shocks, wilting plants etc., then you need to replace your HVAC system, as old appliances can’t properly moisturize the house.
If you feel that you are experiencing any of the given problems, you need HVAC replacement. Feel free to contact us, as we are one of the leading HVAC repair companies in New Jersey. We offer a 24-hour HVAC repair service, so all you need to do is call us and we will send a representative to your house. Don’t forget to share these signs with your family and friends!

Nothing looks sexier than long curled lashes, but lashes often point straight up or down, explains Andrew Sotomayer, celebrity make-up artist. This can make them appear shorter than they actually are, so curl them upwards with an eyelash curler to make them look longer and also lifts the eyes. Having said that, invest in a good eye lash curler and a good mascara. They don't have to be expensive. Try different mascaras until you find the one that best works for you!
Sotamayor also reveals that there is no perfect shade of concealer because according to him, you need 2 shades of concealer; first you need to apply a shade that matches your skin tone to neutralize the grey or brown under tone around the eyes, then layer a lighter concealer on top and carry it out across the cheek bone for a brighter more lifted look!
Rea Ann Silva, celebrity make-up artist and creator of Beauty blender sponge says that the solution to a sallow complexion is cream blush. A good way of applying cream blush is by first finding the apples of your cheeks by smiling, then, using a make-up sponge, apply a dab the blush, blending the colour upwards towards your temples until the edges are diffused.
Celebrity beauty therapist Renee Rouleau's top tip for banishing back acne is by making sure your hair conditioner isn't leaving an oily residue on your bac.It's a little known cause of many outbreaks! She suggests putting your hair up after rinsing out your conditioner, and wash your back, shoulders and upper arms. She likes using an exfoliator body cloth with a gentle shower gel for this purpose. Guess you didn't know this, huh? Neither did I!
Many women suffering from dry skin might resort to thick, chemical laden creams to get a smoother complexion, but these formulas can irritate and sting. Instead, a better, more natural solution is organic virgin coconut oil, says VMV Hypoallergenics founder Dr. Vermen M.Verallo Lowell, which is an ingredietnt that provides water loss and contains fatty acids that are native to human ski, so it goes so far as to replace skin's lost natural oils. It can be applied on the face and body.
Sometimes I wonder how celebrities (almost) always look well rested no matter how busy they are. Yes, they do have personal make-up artists and a whole entourage around them and all, but Renee Rouleau suggests using an eye cream containing Vitamin C, which is shown to assist with capillary repair, constricting blood vessels under the eyes, therefore making dark circles appear less noticeable.
On the mascara you usually see a little container with a number in it, that is when it will expire, however after opening it, it's best to keep it for 3 months max since bacteria can develop. Also, a tip for you, don't pump the mascara since air can get trapped inside and clean the mascara wand regularly! Hope this helps :)

Everyone wants a gorgeous skin which should be free from wrinkles, acne, dark spots etc. To make skin perfect there are many products in the market which claims that it will fulfill our skin requirements and without knowing your skin type requirements we started to use that face serum. DIY face serum for acne is the greatest thing you can ever give to your acne prone skin. It is made up of essential and carrier oils which are the main ingredient that will target our requirements.
Here I am going to share my first experience with DIY face serum for acne which I made it after knowing my skin requirements. If you are a DIY person you can also make your own DIY face serum for acne depending on your face requirements and skin type. To make face serum we should know what is this all about and how can we make DIY face serum for acne.
An essential oil is a concentrated hydrophobic liquid containing volatile aroma compounds from plants. Essential oils are also known as the oil of the plant from which they were extracted. An oil is “essential” in the sense that it contains the “essence of” the plant’s fragrance—the characteristic fragrance of the plant from which it is derived.
Essential oils are also in use for thousands of years for cosmetic purposes, as well as for their spiritually and emotionally uplifting properties.
It goes without saying that essential oils smell great. They not only help you relax but have significant benefits for the skin too. The oils hydrate and heal your skin without clogging the pores. Plus, they help deal with many skin conditions – from acne, dryness, aging to excessive oil.
A carrier oil is a vegetable oil—such as coconut oil, olive oil, or grapeseed oil—is used to dilute essential oils before they are applied to the skin in massage and aromatherapy. They are so named because they carry the essential oil onto the skin. It ensures that essential oils applied topically are comfortable to the skin.
I usually purchase personal care products with all natural ingredients. One day I went to a store to purchase my face wash product. In the store, I noticed the alternative, the all natural products, which used essential oils.
I found these products worked just as well and marked the beginning of my love for essential oils. I got the idea on the internet that essential oils are a panacea that can replace every modern medicine, both over the counter and prescription.
Using Essential oils you have to be patient as it takes the time to show their power over your skin. I am using these oils for the past 7 months and I can see the effect on my skin. My skin has become softer and less problematic as my skin is acne prone and a combination type of skin. I get no further breakouts and my dry parts of my face feel hydrated. My DIY face serum for acne is also reducing dark circle around my eyes and helps me fading dark acne spots. If some essential oil is blended with other essential oils, it becomes more effective on skin because you will get many benefits from different oils in one application.
In all actuality, you just have to buy a carrier oil, to begin with, and test it on your face. See if your skin loves the base oil you choose, and then you can build on that.
Your carrier oil is the main ingredient in your facial oil blend. My two favorite carrier oils are argan oil and/or jojoba oil because they’re both very healing and nourishing, they’re both very light and they sink into your skin without any feeling of greasiness, and they’re great for all skin types.
I use this facial serum at night to rejuvenate and heal my skin. At daytime, I use my diy aloe vera acne gel which really works for me and helps my skin to get rid of acne.
Since I have started to use the 100% pure carrier and essential oil for my skin, I think I will never turn to synthetic cosmetics that contain toxic chemicals and filler ingredients ever again.
Sweet almond oil (just an all-around great facial oil, but it takes a bit longer to “sink in” than the first two)
Plan on your carrier oil for at least 2/3 of your facial serum mixture (we’ll talk about mixing at the end).
I am sharing the recipe of essential oils that I am using for the past 7 months from which I got a problem free skin. I use some of the essential oils mixed with my favorite carrier oil.
These essential oils are the oils that are a little more pricey, but with that price tag comes a beautiful kick in the pants to your troubled skin. Remember! You only need a couple of tiny drops of essential oil to get an amazing benefit for your skin. Essential oils are potent (and they last forever when you use them this way)!
Lavender oil helps regenerate skin cells and reduce scarring and sunspots. When applied to the skin, they improve blood circulation and heal burns, cuts, and bruises.
Clove oil contains a substance called eugenol, which has antibacterial properties and it is great for acne treatment.
Tea-tree essential oil is one of the most popular oils for oily and acne-prone skin. It helps regulate oil production in the skin and has antibacterial properties that help get rid of the acne-causing bacteria.
Chamomile oil removes dark circles without hampering the beauty of our eyes from the regular application. It eases the blemishes and evens the skin tone.
Frankincense oil is powerful astringent capabilities. It can help to eliminate sun spots, remove micro-wrinkles around the eyes and cheeks, and generally tone and tighten skin all over your body, while simultaneously replacing old or dying cells with new, healthy ones! And heals the scar also.
Cedarwood oil is helpful in making the sebum secretion under control. Therefore cedarwood essential oil is good for whitening of oily to combination skin.
If you love nature extracted essential oils then you should also check out how to make scalp and hair problem free.
DIY Face serum for acne is the greatest thing you can ever give to your skin. It treats acne, heals scars and lightens dark spots.
1. Firstly dilute the essential oils in a carrier oil. Be sure to do a patch test to make sure your skin does not have an adverse reaction to the oils. The inner forearm is a great place to do a test since the skin is delicate, similar to facial skin.
2. Additionally, pregnant women, infants, and young children should avoid certain essential oils. so be sure to do your homework beforehand.
Hi Devon, while creating a face serum, essential oils are mixed with carrier oils. As long as the proportion of essential oils in a carrier oil is correct it will never do any harm to your face.
How many drops of the serum do you need to use? and how long should 15ml of the serum typically last?
Hi Sneha, 4-5 drops of serum is enough for you to face. If you use 2 times in a day, a 15 ml bottle should last for 3 months.(As per my experience).
hi is acne scars is d same as the wholes on your face dat made from acne when u dig ur face due to acne
Hi Mamta, would this serum help me with the dark circles as well as acne? If I’m not mistaken, u’ve wrote above that it helped u with ur dark circles. I’d be more than glad if it does.
Hi, Anushree, the serum did help me with removing dark circles. But you need to take extra care while using it around your eye area as it contains strong essential oils like clove and tea tree oil. Be careful while using it.
Hi Sheila, My post is about dark spot and scars due to acne. I would not recommend it for age spot and freckles.
Is it ok if use grapeseed oil instead of jojoba oil? What i have now is tea tree, lavender and frankincense e oil is it ok of enough to make a acne face serum?
I like lavender, but not too much. Do you think this would still work if I cut back on lavender and increased frankincense?
You can get rid of lavender essential oil for this recipe if you want to. But make sure you don’t use excessive frankincense essential oil in place of lavender oil. You can increase the proportion of frankincense essential oil by 1 drop if you like. Increased proportion of frankincense essential oil increases the sensitivity to your skin. Do a patch test before using this.
Hye there Mamta. Yyv’s here. thank you for sharing the recipes with us. im glad to have read this as it comes handy. seeing the list of the EO’s, if i were to put only three of them, what would you recommended? and how about the proportion after that? should i reduce the drops based on its properties? as for the carrier oil, i only have apricot in my drawer. will that be good enough? thank you in advance Mamta!!
You can use apricot oil as a carrier oil. The recommended essential oils for this are 10 drops of lavender oil, 5 drops of tea tree and 3 drops of frankincense oil. Mix all these in 10 ml of apricot oil.
Thanks for shariinngg! I’d love to try and make this, I have all the oils EXCEPT for Clove *sigh*. Can I replace it with Nutmeg/Helichrysum? Or is there any other essential oils you recommend?
Hi, I only have lavender, frankincense and grapeseed oil in my ref. Can I create a serum, how many drops do I used to for 10ml bottle. Thank you in advance
Fill 3/4 of the bottle with grapeseed oil, then add 12 drops of lavender oil and 5 drops of frankincense oil. Shake well before every use.
Hi, I’m in my late thirties and recently I’ve started having acne that I thought I’ve gotten rid off since some years back.. I have the following carrier oils.. Almond oil, Jojoba oil, Rose hip oil and Coconut oil.. And I have the following essential oil: lemon, sandalwood, castor, Lavender, neroli, rosemary, tea tree, castor, rose oil.. How do I mix them?
In a 10ml bottle pour 3ml rosehip and jojoba oil each and mix 5 drops of tea tree oil, 5 drops of rose oil, 5 drops of lavender oil and 2 drops of lemon oil.
Hey, m using a 50 ml bottle for making my serum ..since m not able to get a smaller size …do you think it would be okay to do so.
So how and when do you dilute with a carrier oil? In the 15ml bottle do you just add the carrier oil and essential oils? How much carrier oil should be used on an adult for daily use of this serum?
Hi what are the proportions for a 60 ml bottle? I have cedarwood, lavender, and tea tree essential oils and rosehip and hemp seed for carrier oils. Thank you
3/4 bottle should be filled with hemp seed oil and rosehip oil. Then add 7 drops of lavender, 7 drops of tea tree and 5 drops of cedarwood essential oil to prepare this.
Hi Vivilya, Lavender, frankincense, lemon and tea tree oils are great for the acne prone and combination skin. All these oils do work for dark circles except tea tree oil. Do not use tea tree oil for your eye area application, it’s risky but you can apply it to your face. Here is the recipe for dark circle- Take 10ml rosehip oil and add 5 drops lavender oil, 3 drops frankincense and 1/4 teaspoon vitamin E oil. Mix all and apply twice. Store it in a dark-colored glass container.
Hi KD, this serum is for acne scars and dark spots. For injury marks, you can try this serum. Here is the link- http://alluringsoul.com/diy-face-serum-for-pigmentation-scars-dark-spot/
You might get a few breakouts in the beginning but in the long run, this will help you get rid of acne and scars. Till now, I have not found anyone complaining about breakouts. Even I also didn’t get any breakouts while using it.

b.Jan. 8, 1836, Dronrijp, Netherlands. d.June 25, 1912, Wiesbaden, Germany. Painter and designer of Dutch birth. The son of a notary, Alma-Tadema demonstrated an early artistic ability. In 1852 he entered the Antwerp Academy, where he studied under Gustaf, Baron Wappers, and Nicaise de Keyser. An important influence at this time was Louis De Taye, Professor of Archaeology at the academy and a practising artist. Alma-Tadema lived and worked with De Taye from 1857 to 1859 and was encouraged by him to depict subjects from the early history of France and Belgium. This taste for historical themes increased when Alma-Tadema entered Baron Henri Leys studio in 1859 and began assisting him with his monumental frescoes for the Antwerp Town Hall. While in Leys studio, Alma-Tadema produced several major paintings, for example the Education of the Children of Clovis (1861; ex-Sir John Pender priv. col., see Zimmern, p. 3) and Venantius Fortunatus Reading his Poems to Radagonda (1862; Dordrecht, Dordrechts Mus.), which are characterized by their obscure Merovingian subject-matter, rather sombre colouring and close attention to detail. Related Paintings of Alma-Tadema, Sir Lawrence :. | The SculPtor's Model | Catullus Reading his Poems at Lesbia's House (mk23) | the tepidarium | Portrait of Ignacy Jan Paderewski (mk23) | The melodrama of such works (mk24) |
German Impressionist Painter, 1868-1932 German painter, printmaker and illustrator. His father, adjutant and friend of the future Prince Regent, Luitpold (1821-1912), died when Slevogt was just two years old. His mother moved to Werzburg, where he spent his schooldays. Even in his childhood and adolescence, family connections brought Slevogt to Pfalz, to an aunt in Landau and to the Finkler family in Neukastel. Initially he had planned to become a musician, but he began to study painting at the Akademie der Bildenden Kenste in Munich in 1885. His fellow students included Gabriel von Hackl (1843-1926), Karl Raupp (1837-1918), Ludwig Herterich (1856-1932) and Wilhelm von Diez (1839-1907). In 1889 he spent a term at the Academie Julian in Paris. At that time Impressionism had very little effect on him. Following a trip to Italy in 1890 with the painter Robert Breyer (1866-1941) who had befriended him at the Akademie, he began to work independently as a painter in Munich. In 1893 he participated in the first exhibition of the newly founded Munich Secession, exhibiting Wrestling School (1893; Edenkoben, Schloss Villa Ludwigshehe); the judges wanted to refuse this painting as immoral since its entwined and naked men caused offence. In the following years his paintings often appeared harsh and non-academic to conservative Munich circles. At this time Slevogt also made contributions to the journals Jugend and Simplizissimus, which were significant in the development of his graphic work.
French painter (b. 1619, Paris, d. 1690, Paris) French painter and designer. He dominated 17th-century French painting as no other artist; it was not until over a century later, during the predominance of Jacques-Louis David, that artistic authority was again so concentrated in one man. Under the protection of a succession of important political figures, including Chancellor Pierre S?guier, Cardinal Richelieu and Nicolas Fouquet, Le Brun created a series of masterpieces of history and religious painting. For Louis XIV and his chief minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert he executed his greatest work, the royal palace of Versailles: an almost perfect ensemble of architecture, decoration and landscape. After Colbert's death in 1683, he was no longer able to count on prestigious commissions

Construction equipment is one of the world's most technologically advanced industries. The industry has a great need for knowledgeable and skilled technicians to test equipment, diagnose problems, and make high quality and efficient repairs.
Dealers of construction equipment are looking for talented young men and women - just like you - to explore technician career opportunities that offer challenge, interesting work, the chance to grow personally and professionally, and excellent compensation.
At www.aedfoundation.org/careers, The AED Foundation provides students, student career influencers, guidance counselors, recruiters and others with information about how to explore specifically the attractive equipment dealer technician career opportunity.
It’s tough today to try to get the attention of students and those having an impact on their career decisions.
There has been and remains a culture with a bias toward 4-year degrees and white collar professions.
In many places, student technicians still have to deal with the old “grease monkey” or “vocational education" stereotypes.
It is up to the industry to approach all the aforementioned people and biases, and work to change these attitudes to reflect the reality of today. That is, equipment technicians are highly skilled, well-educated professionals that work on very sophisticated and complex machinery. These jobs provide excellent compensation, interesting and challenging work, high employer demand, personal and professional growth and job satisfaction. These career web pages are designed to communicate these ideas to young people nationwide.
Established in 1919, Associated Equipment Distributors (AED) is an international trade association based in Schaumburg, IL, representing over 800 construction equipment distributors, manufacturers and industry-service firms. AED members sell, service and rent equipment to such markets as heavy and light construction, mining, agriculture, forestry, aggregates, engines and industrial. Established in 1991 and directed by AED members, The AED Foundation addresses professional education and workforce development in the industry. This includes AED Accreditation of diesel-equipment technology college programs.

LONDON (Reuters) - Australian scientists have proved what is common knowledge to most people -- that teaspoons appear to have minds of their own.
In a study at their own facility, a group of scientists from the Macfarlane Burnet Institute for Medical Research and Public Health in Melbourne secretly numbered 70 teaspoons and tracked their movements over five months.
Supporting their expectations, 80 percent of the spoons vanished during the period -- although those in private areas of the institute lasted nearly twice as long as those in communal sections.
"At this rate, an estimated 250 teaspoons would need to be purchased annually to maintain a workable population of 70 teaspoons," they wrote in Friday's festive edition of the British Medical Journal.
They said their research proved that teaspoons were an essential part of office life and the rapid rate of disappearance proved that this was under relentless assault.
Regretting that scientific literature was "strangely bereft" of teaspoon-related research, the scientists offered a few theories to explain the phenomenon.
Taking a tip from Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy books, they suggested that the teaspoons were quietly migrating to a planet uniquely populated by "spoonoid" life forms living in a spoonish state of Nirvana.
They also offered the phenomenon of "resistentialism" in which inanimate objects like teaspoons have a natural aversion to humans.
Humanity must mourn modern creative genius lost early. One thinks of Douglas Adams and Jim Henson in particular.
Good article. I would speculate that after a certain saturation point, the spoons would no longer need to be replenished. Everyone would have at least one at their desk and several would have actually been lost (garbage).

50 percent of car value: While the maximum loan amount varies, the amount a person can receive for a title loan is never more than half of their cars value. One paycheck: Payday loans can be for any amount, but they are traditionally only written in the amount of one full paycheck (or less) so borrowers will have the money in their account when their check is cashed.
Length of loan. Title and payday loans are short-term loans, meaning borrowers get the money quickly but also have to pay back the amount they owe with interest in a limited amount of time. The length of time a borrower has to pay back their loan varies from lender to lender, but there are some industry standards.
30 days: A common amount of time allowed for title loan repayment is 30 days. Some lenders may give you another 30 days if you cannot pay on time. To avoid defaulting on a loan, see if a relative or good friend can help with the payments. This allows you additional time to pay your friend back without worrying about losing your car or incurring extra interest fees. If you cant pay back the loan, or wont be able to, you may have to look at selling the vehicle or other items you own best 10 000 personal loan and clear.

Casper, the online bed-in-a-box pioneer that disrupted the traditional mattress retail business, is doing it again. This time bringing the experience of sleeping in a Casper bed to a whole new level.
Casper has opened its first nap showroom, as opposed to a bed store, in Greenwich Village, New York , called The Dreamery. It is a place where people can experience actual sleep, rather than just buy a new mattress.
The concept is simple, and brilliant. People can schedule a nap break at The Dreamery to enjoy 45-minutes of rest in one of its nine Casper-equipped sleep pods fully decked out in Casper beds, sheets and pillows with a sleep mask included. After nap time, guests can enjoy a cup of coffee in the lounge. Bathrobes, ear plugs and makeup wipes are also available to make guests feel comfortable. Walk-ins are also welcome.
The Dreamery’s 45-minute time block is based upon science that finds it is the optimum time people need to refresh and recharge in the day, without feeling groggy afterwards.
A nap will cost $25, a small price to pay for improved health and productivity. “The Dreamery is about making sleep and rest a part of our regular wellness routines — similar to how many people prioritize a workout class,” said COO Neil Parikh in a statement. “The concept enables us to pilot new ways of bringing better sleep to more people and to more places — whether that’s here, the workplace, airports, or beyond.”
The Dreamery takes Casper to a whole new level in experiential retail. Since its founding in 2014 as an exclusive ecommerce business, Casper has been expanding rapidly in physical retail, starting first in 2016 in partnership with West Elm, which ended after year, coincidentally not long after it announced a new retail partner.
In May 2017 Casper joined with Target to put its mattresses and bedding products into 1,000 Target locations. For Target, Casper is more than just a bedding brand to stock in its stores. Target invested $75 million in the company, becoming the the lead investor in a $170 million round of funding which was used to launch a design lab in San Francisco, as well as “to pursue other brick-and-mortar opportunities,” the company stated.
Not long after, Casper opened 15 of its own branded pop-up shops in major cities across the country. A special feature in each pop-up shop is a home-like setting where customers can test drive the mattresses for 20-minutes trial sessions.
But that was clearly not enough time to get the full Casper sleep experience. So when it opened its first permanent showroom in New York this year, it took retail space in the same block for The Dreamery.
Casper disrupted the traditional business of mattress retail because it evolved from the 4Ps of marketing approach that is so evident in traditional mattress retail – Product, Price, Promotion and Place. Here’s looking at you, Mattress Firm, blanketing the country with over 3,000 retail locations.
What Casper understands, and too many mattress retailers like Mattress Firm don’t, is that they are not just in the business of selling mattress and bedding products. They are in the business of providing customers with a better sleep and shopping experience. The products they sell are only the means to that end.
Exchange (what is the value of a better sleep and mattress shopping experience?) becomes the new Price (how much can you discount to get people to buy?);
Evangelism (pull people in for a better sleep and mattress shopping experience) rather than Promotion (push out paid advertising to promote sales); and
Everyplace (Casper is available everywhere people have a smart phone, tablet or computer) is new Place (mattress store).
Yes, Casper is in the business of selling more mattresses and bedding products. But it focuses on people’s sleep problem and even more importantly from a retail point of view, their mattress shopping problem. Casper solves those problems by not just selling a better mattress cheaper, but by remaining focused on the customers’ complete experience.

Tomorrow is Election Day and that means your social media will be filled with pictures "I Voted" stickers and selfies. After all, if you didn't get a sticker, did you even vote? But in Idaho, is that even legal?
Actually, technically yes. You can take a selfie in the voting booth, but it is kind of discouraged. Some states have even stricter laws when it comes to pictures at polling areas.
Don't pout. Stop hating. Deep inside. Behind closed doors. This was your jam. My favorite from the better BSBs, ever since their Disney Channel concert debut. That's right, i remember that.

If you can hike all the way past the main mountain hut to Ivancev Dom at the top you’ll see excellent views and receive a warm welcome by the guy who runs it. (He serves drink and food)

Y’all Labor Day is quite possibly my least favorite holiday of the year. Just when I’m starting to come to terms with the fact that school is in fact here and I’m going to have to deal with class schedules and homework for the next 9 months a four day weekend rolls around and throws me right back into summer mode. This year I’m a little more excited for the long weekend though because I get to take a mini road trip to attend my cousin’s bridal shower and I wouldn’t have been able to attend if I didn’t have the extra time off of school. If the day after the Labor Day weekend is as much of a struggle for you as it is for me I’m sharing the coziest outfit that will keep you looking put together when you just want to go back to bed. It’s also what I wear pretty much nonstop in the Autumn so hopefully it will help you get into the fall spirit too!
This tshirt is from a company called Z Supply, they’re fast fashion unfortunately, but they are donating 100% of the profits from this shirt to the anti-trafficking organization The Exodus Road and if you post a photo with #everydayeveryone they’ll donate $5 to The Exodus Road. It’s also soo comfy and I’ve been living in it a lot lately.
Unless I let you know otherwise, my posts aren’t sponsored by any of the companies whose products I mention. I won’t accept sponsorships from companies whose products I don’t truly think are really great. However, links marked with an * are affiliate links. Should you click on the links and make a purchase, at no extra cost to you, I’ll go add to my growing stash of tea, or yarn, or pay the fines on that library book that I couldn’t put down for a month.

“Children who attend high-quality preschool enter kindergarten with better pre-reading skills, richer vocabularies, and stronger basic math skills than those who do not.”
They’re vey small – about 1cm across – and pretty basic. White chocolate with soft truffley filling. But I’d hardly cally them “Gourmet”. In fact, I don’t think I’ve ever seen a chocolate that looks quite as much like it’s come off a production line as this. They look more like mass produced white plastic bullets than anything hand made.
Taste-wise, the white chocolate is pretty good – the closest comparison is probably something like Kinder. They’re a little sweet for my liking, but they’re just as moreish as the ‘pillows‘ I reviewed before. This 75g bag lasted me all day, but I did find myself eating them constantly without noticing.
I’m not sure I’d buy these and just eat them out of the bag, but I might buy several bags at once and either stick them in a big bowl to serve at parties or sprinkle them on top of a nice chocolate ice cream. Mmmm.

“Seersucker and Ranunculus- Southern Floral Company created this groom’s neutral ranunculus boutonnière, which didn’t overpower his seersucker suit and pink tie.”
There are so many great ideas in this article. View the slideshow and be sure to see our photo on slide 9! The article suggests “Decking out your groom’s lapel is a fun way to bring a little bit of personality to his wedding-day look, especially if he’s planning on wearing a traditional tuxedo. Whether his boutonnière can contains blooms and colors that nod to the rest of your wedding flowers or a mix of his (or your!) favorite buds, there are countless ways to make your guy’s bout entirely his own. These floral details are also a fun way to give a little nod to the time of year, even if you’re not planning a seasonally-themed fête.”

The MCPO service is one of the services intended to be used on top of ariba (originally as part of the SpoVNet architecture). It realizes a group communication service for applications (and potentially also other services) wishing to send data to more than one receiver with a single transmission.
How MCPO embeds in the overall architecture is shown in the figure to the right. It resides between application and ariba, optionally using the CLIO module for Cross-layer information, if available.
As the main intention of the service is to provide group communication capabilities to applications (without e.g. IP Multicast support), MCPO builds and maintains a hierarchy of clusters, holding a small number of peers each (very similar to the well-known application-layer multicast approach NICE). This operation is of course transparent to the specific application, all that is seen by upper layers is the interface MCPO is accessed through (MCPO API). In its current implementation MCPO will disseminate a sent packet to all peers in the hierarchy, so every member is reachable via one initial transmission request. In future enhancements we will give the possibility to specify (sub-)groups in order to further distinguish sets of peers in one application context. This is useful e.g. for different groups in a game (partitioned by the virtual playground) or for different channels in media transmission scenarios.
The picture to the left shows an exemplary MCPO hierarchy structure and four data dissemination steps. An arbitrary peer sends its data to all peers in the lowest layer cluster it resides in (a). Cluster leaders forward the data to all clusters they are part of except the one the data came from, until all nodes have been reaches (b-d). This picture gives an impression how MCPO disseminates data in the hierarchy. In the following we will explain how application and service programmers can use MCPO and how the basic protocol API is accessed.
MCPO can be used through the provided protocol API. It consists of a part that is used to interoperate with the application (ReceiverInterface?), constructors forservice creation and some methods for e.g. data dissemination. The ReceiverInterface? has to be implemented by the application to indicate two events: If a data packet arrives for the application that has to be handled and to indicate that the MCPO service is ready for service provision (the latter normally arising only once shortly after starting up).
It takes five arguments, being a pointer to the ReceiverInterface? mentioned above (normally the application itself), a pointer to the ariba module to be used, another pointer to the node instance and two optional parameters, the clioNode and a boolean indicating the usage of a visualization. The use of visualization is quite specific to an external visualization tool that has been used in a demonstration of the system and is therefore highly special (and not of importance to the normal user). CLIO is a module that is able to provide important cross-layer information to the MCPO service. These infos are needed for service maintenance, but MCPO is able to gain them autonomously, if needed. So this pointer may be NULL (and in fact out of the box is).
To send data to all members in MCPO, the method sendToAll is used. As the name indicates, there is no further differentiation in subgroups in the current version of MCPO right now (but planned for future releases). To extent this functionality, one will already find the methods joinGroup, leaveGroup and sendToGroup in the code, but those do nothing of interest at the moment. Therfore the MCPO usage is quite simple and limited to the steps: Implementing the ReceiverInterface?, creating the service class and (after having received the serviceIsReady indication) sending data to the service. Thus, MCPO realizes easy-to-use group communication at the application layer.

I actually lost my motivation in Asgard for various reason, so I'd do the WOE with Arigato, probably on Wednesday, but especially Sunday.
welcom here btw you'll have lot of fun (for sure) with us ! if you want some inspiration just ask KoinKoin maybe he will share his awesomeness
I know koinkoin on the battlefield and I was lucky to find myself face to face with him several times
Please tell us some hours before the start of the WoE when you can participate, so that I can add you to the plans.
Reputation is one of the key assets of a digital entrepreneur in markets for experience goods, especially in settings like Darknet and anonymous marketplaces. But what happens if this asset is diminished by a shock, i.e. negative feedback? We study how entrepreneurs on anonymous marketplaces respond to negative feedback by adjusting their product portfolio, or even exiting the market altogether. We find that the entrepreneurs are more likely to exit following negative feedback, but that a entrepreneur’s accumulated transactions experience on the market platform negatively moderates this. Interestingly, the entrepreneurs that do remain tend to expand their product portfolio. This effect, however, is again driven by entrepreneurs with relative high transactions experience, i.e. those with a high prior transactions volume. These results suggest that the reputation and the transactions experience of an entrepreneur interact in intricate ways to drive an entrepreneur’s choice of remaining in the market or adjusting her portfolio. We derive managerial and policy implications of these results.
I've been getting this after EVERY fight that my dwarves engage in. They never start melting when they're say, milling around the barracks training, or going off to raid, or coming back from a raid, or doing whatever else. It's exclusively after they get into a fight, and only when I have temperatures turned on. I even tried embarking in a cold biome to see if that helps, but they still melt without fail after every fight. It's pretty annoying because the blood-loss makes me nervous that they'll die after the fight from wounds they otherwise might've survived.
I realized I forgot to ask this: any sort of modding going on for either of you that could be related to this issue?
Melting in a giant, bacon-smelling inferno caused by trying to build a castle out of giant chunks of meat. Overall, not the worst way to go.
The closest thing Bay12 has to a flamewar is an argument over philosophy that slowly transitioned to an argument about quantum physics.
I am trying to make chickens lay bees as eggs. So far it only produces a single "Tame Small Creature" when a hen lays bees.
Honestly at the time, I didn't see what could go wrong with crowding 80 military Dwarves into a small room with a necromancer for the purpose of making bacon.
If it's exclusively after combat, I would suspect something that is acting via open wounds? Some kind of syndrome coating on their skin that doesn't bother them until it gets pushed inside maybe? Or the other way around, their blood being exposed to air?
If it happens across multiple embarks – Kars tried a cold biome – it seems more likely to be something funky in the dwarves' raws (or possibly domestic animals common to both locations) rather than something an enemy sprays on them.
I have done some very light modding to races in creatures_standard, but nothing involving materials or tissues. Mostly personality stuff, or the addition of generic flags (making satyrs playable, for example).
Nope, I've added [TRAINABLE] to a few animals to make them usable in War, but I was getting this problem even before doing that, and it's the only thing I've changed.
They get this even after fighting simple things such as Gazelles and Ravens, so I really doubt it's some kind of syndrome dust/liquid/what have you as I've also scoured their armor and clothing for anything that could do this, and they're always clean
FACT III: "All life begins with Post-it notes and ends with Post-it notes. This is the truth! This is my belief!...At least for now."
Wasn't there an old bug in which if you managed to remove all of a dwarf's fat through controlled partial incineration, he became fireproof?
I recently became a objectivist, I am reasonably certain that means all my opinions are now universal fact.
No, they could not bleed, because the tissue layers that bled were no longer present, so they could endure all kinds of trauma.
The bug has resurfaced on a new fortress, in a new world generation. Some dwarves went into combat and now they are melting slowly.
At first, I thought it was the zombies the military fought with some kind of horrifying necrosis syndrome or something, but that wasn't the case.
I noticed as they were fighting, they would periodically become stunned for seemingly no reason and then all their fat would suddenly fall out all over the floor into grease and they would become faint.
The military has engaged in multiple fights, but it seems like only when they fight on the surface does it cause them to be stunned (not cave adaptation, they don't become nauseous and vomit) and then shortly after have all their fat just fall off.
It's actually pretty terrifying to think about having all of your fat melt off into grease because you started sweating too much.
I might see if I can't drum up an adventure mode save this weekend. I'd say it'd be even more terrifying when your lower body fat melts because you were reciting poetry.

How many of us go phone call to phone call shopping auto repair shops for estimates to do a specific repair to our vehicle? How many of us have had those cost estimates differ from significantly low to unexpectedly high? How do we then sort through the information we get and decide on which auto repair shop will do the work for us?
Most shops do not seem to understand the importance of customer service, then there are those of us that operate on the basis of what is in the best interest of our customers. With this in mind, we have come across several customers asking for an estimate or would just walk in and ask us to "do a tune up" on their vehicle.
Now let me ask, how many different definitions are there for a tune-up? Honestly, it differs between shops and that's why you get so many different variations in your estimates. Go with the cheapest and you might just be getting plugs and wires and inferior parts. Go with the most expensive and you might just be getting everything from plugs all the way to all filters and fluids replaced.
What can you do to make this ordele more simple and be more educated on what service it is you really need and use that knowledge to get a more accurate representation of estimates between repair shops? Since your definition of a tune up may be different between several auto shops, start by asking the first one you call what they see is recommended by the manufacturer.
A good quality auto repair shop will have the resource to tell you. Once you have the info, ask the auto repair shop to break down their estimate or if it's a "package" price, break down each and every part they will be replacing. Use this same method described above for each subsequent auto repair shop you call. Use this knowledge to help you determine which auto repair shop you provided provided you with the best experience, those answer your questions politely, those who were willing to take the time to break down the estimates and one that offers a warranty for the work performed , they may not be the "cheapest" but they are typically the ones that will treat you right and use quality parts on your vehicle.

We will be attending the live performance of Pete The Cat at The Rose Theater in Omaha on Thursday, September 24th. Buses will leave at 9:00 AM and return at 11:30 AM. Due to limited seating in the theater teachers and staff will be the only chaperons attending. We look forward to this learning opportunity as Pete The Cat is one of our all time favorite characters!!
Thank you for providing healthy snacks each day. We have enjoyed cheese, grapes, fruit kabobs. apples and peanut butter, granola bars, bananas, and several other healthy choices. A low sugar snack provides us with the energy needed to complete all of our learning tasks. Our days are BUSY!!!
Thank you for taking time to have your child practice skills at home. The Friday homework folders provide an opportunity for practice of skills taught during the week. The work also allows you as parents to observe your child's understanding and independence in practicing the skills. If you have any questions about homework please do not hesitate to ask. Keep in mind that students are learning to read and write at school. All homework should be completed by students with kid writing. As kids are developing skills it is okay to copy print and use inventive spelling.
Environmental print are the words and labels we find in our daily environment. The print we see all around us is a great learning tool for learning to read and write. Reading and copying words around the home is a great activity to promote beginning reading and writing. Cereal boxes, books, magazines, cell phones, and refrigerators are some places in which print can be found. If your child is copying environmental print at home encourage them to bring and share their work with their teacher. We love to celebrate learning at home.
We continue to practice counting and to develop number sense. A great way to practice number sense is to predict the number of objects before counting and then check to see how accurate the prediction was. This is a skill you can easily practice at home.
You are welcome to join your child for lunch at school anytime. Our scheduled lunch time is 12:30 PM. It is a good idea to arrive 10 minutes early and reservations are not necessary.
Conference notes have been sent home. The schedule can also be accessed by using the link below. I look forward to spending time with you and your child discussing progress and expectations at school. If you are unable to attend the scheduled time please contact me in advance so we can reschedule.
My name is Amy Higginbotham and I love teaching! I teach at Kreft Primary School in the Lewis Central School district. I live in Council Bluffs, IA.
A major new exhibition of work by Jenny Holzer opens today in Gateshead at BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art. The exhibition, in one word, is stunning. The walk up to the BALTIC reveals the first insight into what is to come inside; the façade of the building emblazoned with “THE BEGINNING OF THE WAR WILL BE SECRET”.
Holzer’s use of text as art rises to a new political level as she takes classified documents from the US Government, made public under the Freedom of Information Act, and creates impressive LED sculptures displaying this information repeatedly in bright, flashing, almost blinding fashion. The documents in question range from emails between US Military officials, emails discussing the interest in oil as the cause of the conflict, and documents regarding prisoner-questioning methods. The sculptures themselves are breathtaking, filling the dimly lit white space with bright pink, green and amber, disappearing in to the walls in their various forms to give a sense of their endless nature. Whilst demanding your attention, it is clear that they are complex and often difficult to stand and read. While I think one of the major points to the work is to reveal once confidential material, just the fact that it is playing on a loop, always being released, unclassified and made public. A statement is always being made and cannot be stopped.
Also included is The Redaction Paintings Series, first exhibited in 2006. The series, taken from original official documents, depicts handprints belonging to US soldiers accused of crimes in Iraq. They have been defaced with heavy marks to erase the prints that differentiate them. By refusing to separate the convicted from the wrongly accused, Holzer demonstrates the failure of war to differentiate.
One of the earliest works of the exhibition, Lustmord Table (1994) is perhaps the most quietly unassuming, yet most disturbing of the show. Trigged by the conflict in former Yugoslavia, human bones laid out neatly on tables are collared with silver rings engraved with text. They illustrate directly the connection between physical and psychological consequences of conflict, war and trauma.
By moving to the upper floor, the exhibition takes a more personal turn into Holzer’s mind, with my personal favourite, Monument, a 20-foot-high LED sculpture, comprising of 22 semi-circular bands emblazoned with the artist’s Truisms and Inflammatory Essays, throwing out ironic sayings that always seem to relate to your own personal experiences. One of the highlights is a huge, floor-based sculpture, ideal for viewing from the top floor viewing platform – definitely recommended if you visit this show.
Holzer’s take on peace, conflict, love and longing and survival are perfectly captured throughout this exhibition, providing the viewer with the best of both worlds – incredibly stunning visuals, coupled with unsettlingly global and personal ideas.
Jenny Holzer is showing at BALTIC Centre for Contemporary Art from today (Friday 5 March) until Sunday 16 May. For more information, please see www.balticmill.com
In 2010 Mexico celebrates a double anniversary: the bicentenary of its independence and the centenary of its revolution. The occasion is being marked by festivities in Mexico and around the world, all year long. Belgium will play a prominent role in the celebrations. The bicentenary commemorates 200 years of Mexican independence or – to be more precise – the beginning of the country's struggle for independence. It was on 16 September 1810 that the "¡Grito de Dolores!" rang out, the call to fight the Spanish invader issued by Miguel Hidalgo, also renowned for his summons, "¡Mexicanos, Viva México!" About 100 years later the Mexican Revolution was initiated by those who resisted the rule of President Porfirio Díaz. In Mexico the Centenario celebrates the beginning of the Mexican Revolution, one of the first great social uprising of the 20th century. In the context of this double commemoration, Mexico has also organised festivities outside its own frontiers.
The ¡México! festival that will take place at the BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts in 2010 will be the largest Mexican cultural event outside the country itself. Behind the clichés of the Aztec god Quetzalcoatl, the Virgin of Guadalupe, and revolutionaries in sombreros, you can discover, over three whole months, a rich and complex nation that is constantly inventing and deconstructing its own "Mexicanness".
The five exhibitions at the BOZAR Centre for Fine Arts this spring will offer a fine overview of Mexican culture, past and present. The keynote exhibition Imágenes del mexicano (11 February > 25 April) sketches, in 150 portraits, "the Mexican", as seen by both Mexican and foreign artists, including Hermenegildo Bustos, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Frida Kahlo y su Mundo (16 January > 18 April) offers an opportunity to explore the world of Mexico's most famous painter in an exhibition that presents the entire Kahlo collection of the Dolores Olmedo Museum (19 paintings, an etching, and 6 drawings), as well as photographs of the artist's family, friends, and surroundings. Photography and architecture are also represented, in Mundos mexicanos: 25 Contemporary Photographers (11 February > 11 April) and Mexican Modernisms (11 February > 11 April). In The Mole’s Horizon (11 February > 25 April) visitors to the Centre can also discover the work of contemporary artists such as Daniel Guzmán, Jorge Satorre, Ilán Lieberman, Teresa Margolles, Yoshua Okón and Sergio de la Torre. Throughout the festival (11 February > 25 April), moreover, Alejibres, fantastic papier mâché creatures from the Museo de Arte Popular de México, will be on display in the Horta Hall.
In addition to these five exhibitions, the performing arts will also be at the heart of the Mexico festival. There will also be literary encounters with Jorge Volpi (1 April) and Paco Ignacio Taibo II, two worthy successors of Carlos Fuentes. Cinema also features in the festival, with a panorama of the new Mexican cinema (at the CINEMATEK) and a day devoted to the new Mexican documentary, in the presence of the directors (25 April). Onstage, audiences can also see two works directed by Claudio Valdés Kuri, who made a great impression at the KunstenFestivaldesArts and at the Wiener Festwochen, El Automóvil Gris (17 April) and El Gallo (20 April). And on the evening of 19 March local audiences can discover the leading lights of the booming and extraordinarily dynamic Mexican contemporary dance scene. On 21 March, moreover, Party Time at the Centre will have a decidedly Mexican flavour.
The built environment is ubiquitous – we cannot escape the structures that define us. This milieu has altered greatly over the past 50 years. The concrete jungle is being replaced by smart, functional designs – there’s even a roof top garden in our building. So, I was delighted to find out about Stephen King’s first solo show – A Storey of Photography. The show reveals secrets and hidden iconic design of city store. It follows the announcement this week that the store is set to close in June for redevelopment. In a poignant turn of events, a contemporary fine art photography exhibition, Lewis’s Fifth Floor: A Department Storey opened 26 February and runs until 30 August 2010 documenting the current state of the store’s fifth floor of this Liverpool institution.
The first solo exhibition by Liverpool photographer Stephen King reflects his visits to the store’s ‘lost’ fifth floor, closed to the public for the last three decades. Its world of 1950s design has remained hidden since it was closed to the public in the early 1980s, being used as a storage floor ever since. King’s photographs record two aspects of the fifth floor, providing a rare glimpse of the spaces which originally comprised three restaurants and what was at one time the world’s largest hair salon, while also revealing the faces of 40 current and ex-employees.
National Museums Liverpool curator Nicky Lewis commented: “Lewis’s is a household name in the city, and we hope this will be a popular exhibition with local visitors who wish to re-capture memories of the store and a bygone age, particularly in light of its impending closure. “The exhibition will also be enjoyed by people who have a passion for history, interior decoration, photography and design. Stephen’s photography captures perfectly the unique aspects of the fifth floor, including specially commissioned artwork that put it at the forefront of interior design in its day. His portrait work with Lewis’s staff puts life back into the now deserted floor.”
Included in the exhibition are images of the cafeteria which once seated 600 people, with its Grade II listed unique hand-painted ceramic tile work still standing the test of time. Created by Carter’s of Poole, the 65 metre long mural is inspired by a mural at the 1951 Festival of Britain which celebrated the best of British design. The Lewis’s mural features condiments, utensils, vegetables and cutlery.
Other features typical of 1950s style were designed to inject vibrancy into the post-war years that saw Liverpool’s population, along with the rest of the UK, emerging from destruction and deprivation. The fifth floor flaunted bright colours and light.
Stephen King commented: “The fifth floor is a great place for photography. However, the randomness that 30 years storage brought to the stylish 1950s and 70s interiors needed making sense of in some way. It became obvious that it was necessary to involve the people who had worked in these spaces to breathe life to the fifth floor once again with integrity. What started out as a purely documentary project now incorporated the new dimension of 40 portraits with ex-employees photographed in their original place of work. I tried to create a series of images that correctly translated both the glamorous and eerie atmospheres that make the fifth floor the strange place it is.”
Lewis’s Fifth Floor: A Department Storey is part of a wider project developed by Neutral Spoon, who also commissioned local artist Jacqueline Passmore to produce a film for the exhibition. Capturing the ghostly abandonment of the fifth floor through the use of old-fashioned cine-film footage of the floor as it is today, the film is overlaid with the voices of the participants recapturing their memories taken from hours of filmed interviews.
The exhibition reminds Merseysiders of their own stories of Lewis’s, but provides all viewers with a unique insight into the history of shopping culture. Stephen’s sympathetic approach to capturing his subjects not only immerses the visitor in the eerie emptiness of the floor but also evokes a feeling of joyful nostalgia and a longing for a time that once was.
As Aesthetica is making international ties from Australia, New Zealand and Japan through to the USA and Canada, I wanted to bring you details about one of the most exciting performing arts festivals in Canada.
Chutzpah! opening later this week in Vancouver runs from 4 March until 8 April, and promises to captivate audiences with a stunning repertoire of dance, music and theatre with a special pre-festival presentation of the Vancouver based dance troupe, Move: the company’s Legacy Repertory Project. This year, to celebrate the Festival’s 10th anniversary, Artistic and Managing Director Mary-Louise Albert has programmed a particularly exciting and eclectic selection of gifted artists from around the world and here in Canada.
Mary-Louise Albert commented: “This is a very special year for the Chutzpah! Festival. I’m so proud of how much the Festival has grown and matured over the past 10 years. The high calibre of music, dance, theatre and comedic artists that Chutzpah! is now able to present, offers Vancouver audiences a very diverse and dynamic experience. I’m particularly excited that we will be celebrating the Festival during the Olympic period as this also offers us the opportunity to show off Chutzpah! to the international stage”.
Kicking off the Festival is The Idan Raichel Project, who burst onto Israel’s music scene in 2002, changing the face of Israeli popular music and offering a message of love and tolerance. With an enchanting blend of African, Latin American, Caribbean and Middle Eastern sounds coupled with sophisticated production techniques and a spectacular live show, the Idan Raichel Project has become one of the most unexpected success stories in Israeli music history, regularly selling out shows worldwide.
For dance enthusiasts, Aszure Barton & Artists return to Chutzpah! with her full company of 9 dancers for a breathtaking and explosive repertoire show. The company will be presenting two works: Busk (2009) retains Aszure Barton's signature style of precise whole-body expression. Original, evocative music by Russian violist and composer Lev Ljova Zhurbin, along with a powerful selection of world sound (including choir music from Sweden's Orphei Drangar), enhance this dynamic piece. Blue Soup (2009) is a bubbling mosaic drawn from Aszure Barton's notable past creations. Dynamic, physical action and emotional honesty propelled by a score of global sound build a powerful, pulsating environment. “Full of surprise and humor, emotion and pain, expressed through a dance vocabulary that takes ballet technique and dismantles it to near-invisibility.” - The New York Times. Gallim Dance from New York with special guest Sidra Bell Dance New York will also enthral audiences. The work Gallim Dance will be presenting, I Can See Myself In Your Pupil, is a suite of dances set to the vibrant music of the Israeli band, Balkan Beat Box.
Theatre go-ers will enjoy a special treat with three great plays. Odysseus Chaoticis by Israel’s Ish Theater is a fantastic cabaret show based on the travels of Odysseus, King of Ithaca. Parts of the mythological Odyssey are intertwined into a story of an eccentric Italian family; a romantic-dreamer husband, his uptight dominating, but loving wife, a needy old Papa and their noisy newborn baby all packed like sardines in their small home. The day-dreaming husband escapes his mundane routine and takes an imaginative journey inspired by Homer’s Odyssey – this is one of the most entertaining hours you will ever spend in the theatre! “An amazing balance between sharp directing and the brilliant improvisational skills of the three clowns, each one of them bursting with talent” - M.Zur-Glozman, Ma'ariv Online.
Also the world premiere of Donald and Lenore - a wild and seductive play about survival set in an underground Tahitian Lounge by internationally renowned Vancouver based playwright Tom Cone, directed by David Bloom and starring Linda Quibel and Billy Marchenski.
With its interdisciplinary nature, Chutzpah! 2010 offers an insightful programme and vast range of performances.

You can’t help but feel like you are disturbing an undeniable sense of stillness as you enter the Japan House Gallery at the Daiwa Anglo-Japanese Foundation; the floor squeaks under your feet and the chandelier sways slightly. Quietly lurking here, tucked away behind a throbbing Marylebone Street, is the first London solo show of Japanese artist, Akiko Takizawa. Her work, hung just shy of the creeping shadows cast by the park’s trees outside, are mainly black and white photographs taken in the county of Aomori in North Japan and at the shrines of Osorezan (Fear Mountain). They depict places where the memories of dead children are remembered and preserved, where their souls are protected and cherished and where parents gather to grieve. Amongst images of the shrines are strange volcanic landscapes, people obscured behind grass, clouds, reflections; every image seems to be cloaked in a melancholic mystery.
In the first room there is a low-standing table in the centre with neatly stacked booklets and a stunningly pristine portfolio of Takizawa’s prints. On the surrounding walls, curated like the pages of a book – readable, simple and considered - are the artist’s peaceful yet haunting images of soft hues of varying greys and transparent whites. The shrines and landscapes seem empty on first appearance, but viewers who spend time with each image, allowing their eyes to adjust to Takizawa’s intricate subtleties of tone will realise that many of the photographs are haunted by translucent faces. In a particularly striking piece, Father #2, a man’s fading body disappears against the chaotic grain of a floor of woodchips. First drawn to the complex textures of the wood, you barely notice the man’s hand drifting quietly in the centre. His face, engulfed by flickers of white, could be sleeping. Is this man a ghost? Is he a memory? Is he dead?
In each landscape a similar obscurity is apparent; in People #4, a family portrait is swallowed by the shadow of temples, the eldest member stooping, skeletal and frowning, and in Waterfall #1, a figure, seemingly still as a rock is cloaked in the waterfall’s shower. There is something very distant about every face in this room, in their vacant expressions, gestures and in Takizawa’s magical and sensitive use of monochrome. My shoes continue to squeak on the floor as I drift in and out of each image and, for a moment, a woman dressed in white and grey (blending strangely into the colours of the exhibit) comes to stand in front of the same photograph as me. We stand almost brushing shoulders and she turns to me and says “Aren’t they sad?” Nodding in agreement I smile, but thinking further, I decide a better word might be “nostalgic” or “peaceful”. Of course there is a sadness in the fading subjects of Takizawa’s images and in the recurrent feeling of a heavy grief, but overall, her work seems gentle, still and warm. They are images of acceptance, not anger.
In the second room, the visitor is confronted yet again with landscapes haunted with faces. In Wedding Up in Heaven, shrines and photographs of deceased children appear and disappear amongst thick streams of clouds, and in Where We Belong, Senbazuru, a shadowed face stares upwards, submerged by tumbling specs. Peering through these obscuring layers in Takizawa’s pieces, you feel as if you am looking into some form of parallel universe, a universe only visible through Takizawa’s lens. As if printed on felt or velvet, the photographs seem to absorb all sound and light; some, such as Earless Houichi, Heiki Ghost, even appear to glow. In one image, Where We Belong, Magnolia #1, the subject, a woman in round spectacles and a red top, is hung on the wall at exactly my height. As I approach, our heads slot into one another and immediately I am engulfed by her landscape, leaves around my head, overwhelmed in a deep yellow. This place, commanded by Takizawa’s work, seems to have a timelessness to it – the past mingling freely with the present. As I leave the gallery, I imagine the chandelier becoming still again and the space reverting to its previous silence. I step outside to head to the station and time begins back on its endless churning.

Jerwood Gallery in Hastings to open March 17th | Q&A with Liz Gilmore, Director of the Jerwood Gallery
There are a lot of projects that get the go-ahead in the name of regeneration, and the savagely debated Jerwood Gallery in Hastings is no exception. There's a whole website devoted to the 'Say No to Jerwood on The Stade' (an area next to the fish market) campaign but one only has look East for two shining examples of cultural regeneration come good; the hugely successful Folkestone Triennial and the celebrated Turner Contemporary in Margate. In geographical terms at least, the Jerwood Gallery in Hastings could become the next in a long-line of galleries on the South Coast (The De La Warr Pavilion, Towner, Turner Contemporary) that are not only worth the short day trip from London but worth our support as they embark on the long process of making a significant difference and a positive impact on seaside towns in need of renewed prosperity. The Jerwood Gallery in Hastings will open its doors to visitors on 17 March 2012. We spoke to Liz Gilmore, Director of the Jerwood Gallery to find out more.
BR: We have seen a wave of new regional contemporary galleries opening in the UK over the last two years; Nottingham Contemporary, Towner in Eastbourne, Hepworth Wakefield, Turner Contemporary, firstsite in Colchester. The general mood was these would be the last of their kind to open for some time to come. How has the opening of the Jerwood Gallery in Hastings been made possible?
LG: Jerwood Gallery has been solely funded by Jerwood Foundation and has come into being through the vision of its Chairman, Alan Grieve. There have been a number of iconic new gallery buildings and re-developments the past 5 years and we are delighted by their successes. Margate’s Turner Contemporary, Bexhill’s De La Warr Pavilion, Eastbourne’s Towner to name but a few. Jerwood Gallery is the final link in the "string of pearls" around the SE coast and delivers a "future-facing" gallery for 2012 – environmentally, artistically and architecturally.
LG: Putting Jerwood Foundation’s collection in the public realm (c. 200 artworks) for the first time and enabling a dialogue between that and a contemporary programme. We open with a retrospective of paintings by Rose Wylie, a 77 year old Kent based artist – the first UK retrospective of her work which will be housed in our contemporary space.
BR: You read about the care required to create a programme that is both ambitious and artistically significant- but also one that will be embraced by the local community. How will the new space in Hastings overcome this challenge?
LG: Building new appetites and balancing that with what people know or hope is on the menu is always a challenge. But the successful galleries always do this well. We are very keen that Jerwood Gallery should be a cultural hub for Hastings, offering an ambitious, nationally significant programme that local people can be proud of. We open with Rose Wylie, then its Gary Hume . . . both artists have had a long association with Jerwood Foundation, personal connections with the region and in terms of ambition, place Hastings/Jerwood Gallery on an international stage.
BR: Would you be able to tell us a bit more about the design of the new gallery? How did the relationship with HAT Projects come about?
LG: The design is a sensitive response to the needs, ethos and qualities of the Jerwood Collection, and to the extraordinary architectural context of the site with its fishing beach, listed net shops and medieval Old Town. It is also an exemplar of environmental sustainability, through passive design, ground source heat pump cooling, solar thermal hot water and other measures.
Seven gallery rooms are dedicated to the Jerwood Collection: a large ground floor gallery is for temporary exhibitions; there is a sculpture courtyard, a first floor café overlooking the fishing beach, education space, library and shop. Its "grand domestic" scale brings a quality appropriate for Jerwood’s Modern British art collection which it will house.
Hana Loftus of HAT Projects worked with Jerwood from the genesis of the project, helping to develop the brief and research potential locations. HAT Projects were then appointed architects to design the project as Jerwood decided they had the best understanding and experience of the needs and ambitions of the project.
LG: It’s the first UK retrospective for Rose Wylie. The title of the exhibition, Big Boys Sit in the Front is taken from the final line of a poem by Robert Creeley (1926-2005 "… the big people, sitting up front"), whom Rose met in Vancouver in 1962. Written late in Creeley’s career, it reminds us, how childhood can feel. This mirrors Rose’s respect for direct imagery, an example of which she finds in the work of African lorry artists which inspired her piece Lorry Art (2010) which is on show for the first time. We’re delighted to be showing new works, including a monumental piece Getting Better with Water, 2011; along with some of her well know works such as Woman Sitting on a Bench with Boarder (film notes) 2007-8.
LG: The collection has grown over 20 years under the aegis of Alan Grieve and celebrates 20th and 21st century British art and artists, some of whom are well-known and some less so.
The first exhibition of c. 58 works puts on show: Flowers in a Terracotta Pot by David Bomberg (1890-1957); a portrait by Stanley Spencer (1891-1959) of his niece Daphne. Some works have strong local resonance – eg: The Churchyard, Rye, by Edward Burra; others international interest for example, a stunning painting of the church of St Remy by Walter Richard Sickert (1860-1942). And a wonderful still life painting, entitled Green Jug by the artist Keith Vaughan (1912-1977).
LG: "Stade" is Anglo-Saxon for 'landing place', and this area of Hastings beach has been used by Hastings fishermen for nearly 1000 years. Indeed, many of the fishermen still working the beach can trace their family history back over several hundred years. It’s an area steeped in history and cultural tradition and a wonderful context for a gallery.
LG: We are both part of the same Jerwood family and work closely and collaboratively. Jerwood Space in Southwark opened in 1998 as a major capital initiative of the Jerwood Foundation and is recognised as one of the best rehearsal spaces for theatre and dance in the UK. The knowledge and experience of staff from that project has been instrumental to the success of our construction. Jerwood Space is also home to Jerwood Charitable Foundation (JCF) who develops and manages the Jerwood Visual Arts programme. Without giving too much away regarding our future programme I can confirm that we expect to show a number of the JVA shows in the future.
BR: It’s good to hear that the Gallery will benefit local communities through outreach activities. In this vein, could you give us an insight into the film collaboration with Project Artworks?
LG: The project captures the moment of practical completion – when we formally took possession of the building after the main construction phase. The film, directed by Kate Adams, MBE, captures the uninhabited Jerwood Gallery, providing poetic and intimate insight into its spaces by people who have perceptual and cognitive impairments but who are highly sensitive to the sounds, surfaces, light and qualities of built space. We will show the film at Jerwood Gallery in July 2012
Dan Flavin (1933-1996) was an American minimalist artist famous for creating sculptural objects and installations from fluorescent light fixtures. His early work focused upon drawings and paintings influenced by Abstract Expressionism but the subsequent focus of his work was an exploration of the artistic possibilities of fluorescent light, limiting his possibilities by restricting his materials to commercially available tubing in standard sizes, shapes and colours.
Flavin's breakthrough came with The diagonal of may 25, 1963 (to Constantin Brancusi) (1963) a simple yellow fluorescent light set at a 45 degree angle. This bold statement effectively challenged art history by stating that a light tube could stand alone as a work of art, thereby attaining cultural significance by reducing the gap between art and everyday life.
This exhibition brings together eight sculptural works from 1963 to 1989, together with three thematic drawings entitled untitled (to the citizens of the Republic of France on the 200th anniversary of their revolution) from 1989. The extent of the works throughout the four exquisite rooms at Galerie Perrotin demonstrate the range of Flavin's vision. four red horizontals (to Sonja) (1963) exudes a visually arresting aura of red fluorescent light of deep intensity and beauty which complements and transforms it's physical surroundings. This contrasts with the subtle simplicity found in the cool white fluorescent light of white around a corner (1965) which comprises a single fluorescent tube placed in the intersection of the walls. This light is echoed and expanded in monument for V. Tatlin (1967) which consists of seven tubes of cool white fluorescent light and is part of a series dedicated to Vladimir Tatlin, a leading figure in the Russian Constructivist movement.
These three-dimensional monochromes belie their minimalist construction by embracing (and occasionally unsettling) the viewer in their glow of light, setting a dramatic and affecting tone. They develop a mood from which spirituality and mystery emanate, the result of which is a sense of timelessness. Flavins work dramatically reinvents the space with his installations of infinite combinations offering seduction and confrontation, promise and desolation.
The blue and pink fluorescent light emitted in untitled (to Don Judd, colorist) 4 (1987) has more than a sense of the iconic and of all the installations, has perhaps the most symbolic and architectural resonance. In untitled (to Charlotte) (1987), Flavin blends red, pink, yellow, blue and grey to create a very real sense of emotion. Through reflections on the floor, walls and ceiling, Flavin explores the behaviour of light through his creations. The lights bleed and stray into the space around the fixture itself and illuminate the space - to which the intimacy of the gallery is perfectly suited. It is said that Flavin disliked the term minimalist, and whilst one cannot help but indulge the minimalism on display, there is a definite richness and density beyond the spectral flood of colours that initially captivate your senses.
In order to inspire, one has to believe and Flavin's belief in his work is perhaps the most illuminating and revelatory aspect of the exhibition. What could so easily have been a neutral and unrewarding love is transformed by the level of engagement in blending colour, light and perspective in a way that goes beyond the physical. Flavin built a lasting legacy, successfully creating monuments of architecture bathed in rays of momentary beauty.
Now in its second year after a successful launch in 2010, the Roundhouse’s Reverb Festival aims to dismantle the stuffy, jargon-loaded image of classical music. While commercially the past decade has seen our musicians take a battering, creatively it’s an exciting time for contemporary music with tastes broadening, genres metamorphosing and live performances defying the rough waters experienced by the rest of the industry. And why shouldn’t classical music experience the same resurgence? By debunking the classical and the experimental, Reverb engages wider audiences in the growth of contemporary classical with the primary aim of creating a relaxed, enjoyable and approachable atmosphere with clear and informal introductions from the performers and composers encouraging listeners to better engage with the work.
An alt-classical a cappella accompaniment to the first Surrealist (though widely-contested as such) film, created by a female director back in 1928, doesn’t leap off the page as an approachable introduction to contemporary classical but, performed as it is following an ethereal performance by Ana Silvera and the Estonian Television Girls Choir, this segue into uncharted waters (for myself at least) works surprisingly well.
Initially commissioned by Birds Eye View Film Festival to marry the two vastly under feminised areas of film direction and classical musical composition, the pairing is initially challenging because we have become so accustomed to expecting a performance out of our singers. I find myself focussing on Imogen Heap and the Holst singers rather than on Germaine Dulac’s pioneering film. With a modicum of self-discipline however the inventive and frequently absurd fluctuations of the human voice animate the silent characters on the screen in a manner that alludes to their minds rather than their spoken words. In this sense Heap has transported La Coquille et le clergyman back into the Surrealist canon by ignoring the conventions of dialogue and focusing (as Surrealism should) on the interior and the subconscious. We feel the puzzlement, rage, dismay and infuriating lust of the clergyman as his erotic fantasies spiral out of control. At times the piece is hilarious and Heap and the Holst singers only serve to emphasise this in their vivid exploration of the possibilities of the human voice (and unabashed lack of pretension and foible). The guttural projections, cries of ecstasy and pants of anticipation and climax only emphasise the bizarre nature of Dulac’s work and of self-righteous denial (a timely observation for the beginning of Lent). In doing so they improve the reception of Dulac’s masterpiece immensely.
More typical of a novice’s expectations of contemporary music is Ana Silvera’s Oracles, which loosely narrate (with instrumental and choral accompaniment) the gamut of emotions involved in a fairytale love affair. At times (such as in The Awakening) Silvera resembles a mellowed Tori Amos, improvising and allowing her accompaniments to catch on. With the emergence of an acoustic score resembling African tribal themes the performers seem to relax into their roles and into the story. Within our visually over-emphasised culture (and as someone focused day-in, day-out on aesthetics) to be transported so readily into a story through music is a welcome revelation.
Continuing into next weekend, Reverb has certainly succeeded in demystifying the classical music experience. Winding down the evening with performances of Silvera and Heap’s best-known works, as well as an eye-opening and exceptional rendition of traditional Estonian music (at times almost primitive and otherworldly, contemporary yet also timeless), the festival treads just the right side of approachable, without patronizing its audience, with a fantastic programme of events.
Richardson has been inspired by the multiple facets of Hollywood life. In his latest show,TERRYWOOD, he unveils a series of images of the famous city, as seen through his eyes. Terryworld meets Hollywood, as the local characters, familiar landscapes, and architectural details verge on a new identity.
With images such as Untitled (Hollywood Neon), and Untitled (Nude), both photographs of the recognisable signs that are ubiquitous throughout Hollywood, Richardson illustrates his penchant for branding (whatever subject matter may be.) Through a medium not typically understood as effective in translating an artist’s personality, Richardson manages to make his hand evident within his photographs. His identity is unmistakably present, as if he created the very objects and scenes his camera captures.
An artist often attributed with changing the field of photography, Richardson also defies the ideological limitations. TERRYWOOD takes all that Hollywood represents - celebrity, broken dreams, kitsch, and re-contextualises it by the works with a different narrative. Richardson is one of the most prolific and compelling photographers of his generation. Known for his uncanny ability to cut to the raw essence of whomever appears before his lens, Richardson's vision is at once humorous, tragic, often beautiful, and always provocative. Born in New York City and raised in Hollywood, he began photographing his environment while attending Hollywood High School and playing in a punk rock band. Richardson‘s work has been the subject of numerous group and solo shows throughout the world, and he has published a selection of books beginning with Hysteric Glamour in1998, followed by a print retrospective titled Terryworld, and most recently released LADY GAGA x TERRY RICHARDSON.

While Starlin Castro and Anthony Rizzo are at the All-Star Game in Minneapolis, the rest of the Cubs will be back home taking care of business. Here's what they'll be up to.
The Week In Review: The Cubs lost four of five to the Reds and two of three to the Braves as they cruise to another no-brainer top-five draft pick.
The Week In Preview: The Cubs resume play with a three-game weekend set in Arizona, which should be a real shitshow 'cause they're vying for the same draft pick.
Wrigley Is 100 Celebration: The Cubs will keep their payroll under $100 million for another 100 years.
Calls Arismendy Alcantara "underappreciated" as a prospect. Maybe that's because he and Theo never told the media to appreciate him.
Prospects Are Suspects: Addison Russell is 5-for-24 with seven strikeouts in his first six games for Tennessee.
That's Ricky: "I am happy how we have continued to play the games. We have been in almost every game this season."
Mad Merch: The Cubs will give a crystal ball to every fan who attends a home game the rest of the season so they can imagine a future better than the past and present. Then again, who needs a crystal ball for that? Also, won't that clash with Kool-Aid Night?
Wishing Upon A Starlin: "That might have been a bigger inning if Starlin Castro hadn't made an ill-considered dash to the plate on a ball that didn't get far away from Laird, who threw him out at the plate. Renteria asked for a review, and it came back 'call confirmed.' Right after that, John Baker hit a two-run double which likely would have been a three-run double and only one man would have been out in the inning instead of two."
Ameritrade Stock Pick of the Week: A strong sell on Addison Russell as his value has already peaked.
Jumbotron Preview: 5,700 square-feet of the 2020 MLB Draft, brought to Chicago by Rahm Emanuel and featuring Theo Epstein picking first for the third year in a row.
Beachwood Sabermetrics: A complex algorithm performed by The Cub Factor staff using all historical data made available by Major League Baseball has determined that selling the future can be more profitable than servicing the present.
To apply this pressure, an inner threaded ring replica watches similar to the inner case back on a Milgauss is used to clamp the rings and movement in place. Because patents are written to cover as broad a set of claims as possible, Rolex also includes an example where the two movement rings are compressed against each other by the normal single case rolex replica sale back alone. Implementing this change does mean production changes for Rolex beyond using the inner case and flange screws. Rolex swiss replica watches needs a gap between case and movement for these two movement rings to occupy. In larger cases like Milgauss this shouldn't be any trouble. In smaller cases like the 36mm replica watches uk Datejust, this may represent a problem. There does not appear to be any room between the case and movement to fill. Rolex replica watches will either have to use this invention on larger case watches or rolex replica sale create a movement smaller in diameter.
New Mexico harbors its share of ghosts—native people ghosts, mushroom cloud ghosts, dinosaur ghosts—not to mention our ghost ocean. I’m sure you all know that New Mexico was once covered by a shallow sea. If you don’t know it explicitly, you can feel it in your bones. It haunts us with little imprints of sea creatures in limestone, strange drowning sensations and plains that are distinctly oceanic on moonlit nights.
Thank God for small mercies like Down N Dirty Seafood Boil. Nothing instantly siphons the sea inland like sticking some steamy crustaceans in your face. And nowhere can you stick steamy crustaceans in your face with such abandon as Down N Dirty.
Why? Because it’s not one of those fish restaurants trafficking in white platters, tinkling silverware and smooth jazz that only serve to remind us just how not at the shore we are. Instead it’s just you, your hands, a napkin dispenser and a knotted clear plastic bag of shellfish drenched in seasoned butter. Down N Dirty perfectly captures the sort of no-muss, dive-y nautical-kitsch you would find in a small town somewhere on the coast.
The strangest thing about the place is how quietly (buzz-wise) it has existed for the first year of its opening, even while it has carved itself such a unique niche—the beach party boil and its primal carnivorous pleasures. Maybe it’s the low-visibility location on north Fourth Street. But I also suspect some people are a little freaked out by the word “seafood boil” (which doesn’t sound appetizing if you don’t know any better) and any suggestion of either getting down or getting dirty.
Just how down and dirty you want to get is up to you—for the shell-shy/sadly squeamish, there's scallops and rock shrimp that involve no peeling. For the rest of us, tie on your sexy, plastic, crab-printed bib because there are crustaceans to be dismembered.
No, I'm serious, put on the bib—this food is wet and messy and plateless, and you will be handling it mostly with your bare hands. (Besides, everyone is wearing bibs—a merry scene we may not see again until the nursing home.)
Here’s how it works: You order your shellfish by the pound ranging from $9.88 (clams) to $32.88 (colossal king crab legs). Prices and offerings flux with the market. The lobster and blue crab are served whole or in pieces over a pound, so you will have to do some price-per-pound math to figure out how much you’re spending.
Our server claimed that most people can down two pounds at a sitting, and while I respect the expansive and patriotic American appetite, this seems excessive. My friend and I couldn’t finish three pounds between us. And I wanted to. The sweet-succulent Down-N-Dirty sauced crab claws ($23.88) we devoured, the deliquescent mussels in garlic butter we barely polished off, but the colossal Cajun-butter jumbo shrimp, we could not conquer. So consider the actual meat content of your chosen victim before ordering.
From there, you select your decadent butter-based sauce of choice (garlic butter, lemon pepper, Cajun or Down-N-Dirty), specify spice-quotient (mild, medium or hot) and decide if you want anything else in the bag. Options include a whole potato, a partial ear of corn (skip it unless you have a weird penchant for overly-soft, cafeteria-grade corn) or a whole sausage (the andouille is good).
The landlocked may find it a little backwards to toss a turfy-pig product in with all of that surfy shellfish, but chucking in sausage is a long-standing boil tradition all along the East and Gulf Coasts. Just think about how you’re mixing and matching. The andouille is the perfect complement for an order of meat-skimpy crawfish in Cajun sauce for instance, but I wouldn’t boil it with my scallops.
Sides include sweet potato fries, onion rings, coleslaw, bread (a white bolillo roll) and white rice. If you think it’s wise to pair butter-drenched sea meats with fried food, by all means make it happen, but I recommend ordering the rice so you can soak up your extra sauce. The sauces here are all quite good (but you should venture outside the “cleaner” ones and try either the Cajun or Down-N-Dirty—an addictive slurry of spices and chopped garlic). And “hot” is still very eatable.
A few caveats—1) don’t upgrade to the more pricey jumbo shrimp. Our server told us all of the shrimp is good, but we found some of the jumbos a little rubbery. 2) Conspicuously missing from the menu is beer, so you’ll have to wash that lobster (once considered poor man’s food) down with a coke or iced tea. 3) Be forewarned this is a pricey meal without the usual pomp and circumstance of a pricey meal—that’s because you’re not paying for atmosphere (there’s a drop tile ceiling) or the royal treatment (though the service is fast and friendly) or haute cuisine. You are paying for the raw materials—the abducted little sea creatures themselves.
So, yes, I love this restaurant. It’s unstuffy, delicious, primal and fun. There are bibs and tin buckets, the gratifying sound of cracking and peeling shells, and enough butter and garlic to drown a sailor. There’s nautical tchotchkes and a crab tank and piles upon piles of sea-sugared flesh found only in shellfish from actual oceans. Oh lordy! No more eating phantom crab legs at home alone! Bless you, Down N Dirty for saving us from that one indignation, on top of our other indignations in this diaphanous, beautiful, ghost-stricken land.

Posted: Tue Dec 20, 2016 2:54 pm Post subject: Mon19Dec BERLIN Gladio C Christmas market lorry kills 9
Deutche Bundes Luge - Polish driver found dead in the cab but random Muslim found 'fleeing the scene', like any sensible person would, and paraded around the world for 24 hours as the perpetrator. Until 'whoops, we got it wrong.'
A truck that crashed into a Christmas market near the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedaechtniskirche (Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church) in Berlin is pictured on 20 December 2016.Image copyrightAFP
The German authorities say they cannot be sure if a man in custody was behind Monday's lorry attack on a Berlin Christmas market that killed 12 people.
"We have to entertain the theory that the detainee might possibly not have been the perpetrator," federal prosecutor Peter Frank told reporters.
The man detained, who has denied involvement, arrived in Germany from Pakistan at the end of last year.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has vowed to punish those responsible for the Berlin attack "as harshly as the law requires".
Her open-door policy on migration, which saw 890,000 asylum seekers arrive in Germany last year, has divided the country, with critics calling it a security threat.
The lorry ploughed through the popular market at Breitscheidplatz, near west Berlin's main shopping street, the Kurfuerstendamm.
Loaded with steel beams, it veered into the market at 20:14 local time (19:14 GMT), crashing through wooden huts and stands packed with tourists and locals.
The BBC's Jenny Hill: "What's really eerie is that the lights are still twinkling in what remains of the market"
Police believe the lorry drove 50-80 metres (160-260 ft) through the market area, Germany's DPA news agency reports.
Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said 18 of the 48 people injured in the attack were in a serious condition.
He arrived in Germany on 31 December of last year, turning up in Berlin in February, Mr de Maiziere said. His asylum application had not been completed.
Citing security sources, German media identified him as Naved B, 23, who was reportedly known to police for minor crimes, but not terrorist links.
Special forces stormed a hangar at Berlin's defunct Tempelhof airport, where they believed he had been living in a shelter.
The suspect was seized after fleeing the scene on foot for more than a mile (2km) towards the Tiergarten, a large public park.
A witness who followed him called the police, who quickly detained the suspect near the Victory Column monument.
After Berlin police expressed doubt about whether they had in fact detained the right man, Mr Frank, the country's public prosecutor general, said: "Currently we don't know whether it was one or several perpetrators.
Ariel Zurawski, the Polish owner of the lorry, confirmed his driver had been missing since 16:00 (15:00 GMT) on Monday.
The lorry was registered in Poland but it is unclear whether it was travelling from Poland or returning from Italy, as some reports suggest.
Chancellor Merkel said she was "shocked and very saddened", adding: "We don't want to live with fear of evil."
Germany's interior ministry said Christmas markets in Berlin would remain closed on Tuesday but other markets outside of the capital would operate as normal.
A senior member of Germany's anti-immigration AfD party, Marcus Pretzell, blamed Mrs Merkel, linking the attack to her open-door migration policy.
Horst Seehofer, the leader of Mrs Merkel's sister party in Bavaria, urged the chancellor "to rethink our immigration and security policy and to change it".
A British witness, Mike Fox, told the Associated Press news agency that the 25-tonne lorry had missed him by only about three metres as it smashed through stands.
Politicians and members of the public have started paying tribute to the victims at the popular market
Australian Trisha O'Neill told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation: "I just saw this huge black truck speeding through the markets crushing so many people and then all the lights went out and everything was destroyed."
Monday's incident mirrored the lorry attack on Bastille Day crowds in the French city of Nice on 14 July, claimed by so-called Islamic State (IS).
At the end of 2014, a van was driven into pedestrians at a Christmas market in the French city of Nantes, injuring 10 people.
Last week, German prosecutors said a 12-year-old German-Iraqi boy was in custody on suspicion of plotting to blow up a Christmas market in the western town of Ludwigshafen.

The prime suspect for the Berlin massacre was under covert surveillance for months as a possible terrorist threat until police let him slip through their grasp earlier this month.
Anis Amri, 24, a Tunisian asylum seeker who arrived in Germany last year, was investigated for “preparing a serious crime endangering national safety”, involving funding the purchase of automatic weapons for use in a terrorist attack.
Amri had been arrested earlier this year and was known to be a supporter of the terrorist group thought to be behind the Sousse terrorist attack in Tunisia, as well as being a suspected disciple of a notorious hate preacher.
He had multiple identity documents with six different aliases under three nationalities, and a criminal record in Italy and Tunisia. He spent four years in an Italian prison before travelling to Germany after an expulsion order expired.
The German authorities, who were on Wednesday facing serious questions about how Amri was still at large, tried to deport him in June, but because he had no valid papers proving his nationality he was allowed to stay.
In a further twist, Germany had asked Tunisia to issue a new passport for him so he could be deported, but the document only arrived on Wednesday – two days after the Christmas market attack that claimed 12 lives. It also emerged that the killer might have received hospital treatment for his injuries before slipping away.
The Polish lorry driver whose vehicle was hijacked and used in the attack – claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) – was being hailed a hero after police said it was possible he sacrificed his life to cut short the carnage
Yet more pressure was piled on Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, who was already facing criticism from opponents and supporters alike over her “open door” refugee policy that allowed migrants into the country without vetting
Two Britons were treated for shock and minor injuries after being caught in the Christmas market attack.
On Wednesday night, Mrs Merkel was receiving regular updates on the huge manhunt for Amri, whose name was found on documents under the driver’s seat in the cab of the lorry used in the attack.
The hunt spread across the borderless Schengen zone, with police conceding that the suspect could have travelled hundreds of miles since Monday night’s outrage.
His brother Abdelkader Amri said from his home in Tunisia: “When I saw the picture of my brother in the media, I couldn’t believe my eyes. I’m in shock, and can’t believe it’s him who committed this crime. If he’s guilty, he deserves every condemnation. We reject terrorism and terrorists – we have no dealings with terrorists.”
Police are believed to have found Amri’s blood in the lorry’s cab. They now assume that whoever was driving the lorry was badly injured, either when pieces of wood smashed through the windscreen or in a fight with Lucasz Urban, the Polish driver.
Squads of officers have been to every hospital in Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg trying to ascertain if the killer was treated in any of them.
Mr Urban’s injuries suggested he may have been alive as the lorry ploughed into Christmas shoppers, having perhaps been assumed dead by the hijacker who had stabbed and beaten him.
It gave rise to the theory that he grabbed the steering wheel, forcing the lorry off its intended course through the middle of the crowd and potentially saving countless lives. His life came to an end when he was shot in the head by the hijacker.
Mr Urban’s family said he would have fought “to the end”, while a security source said his bloodied and swollen face meant “there must have been a fight”.
Police hunting for Amri are believed to be focusing their search in North Rhine-Westphalia, the industrial area of Germany that borders the Netherlands and Belgium where he had been living when he came under investigation this year.
Prosecutors in Berlin said he was placed under surveillance on March 14 following a tip-off that he might be planning a robbery to finance the purchase of automatic weapons for use in a terrorist attack.
He was observed dealing drugs in a Berlin park and fighting in a bar, but the surveillance was called off in September. Another report suggested his mobile phone was still being monitored but that he went underground earlier this month and police lost track of him.
Amri was arrested in August with a false Italian identity document, but released shortly afterwards. Other sources suggested his arrest was in connection with a grievous bodily harm case.
He had lived in Berlin for most of his stay in Germany, but recently moved back to refugee accommodation in Emmerich, near the Dutch border, which was raided by police yesterday. His family were also being questioned by investigators in Tunisia.
Amri lived with a flatmate who was arrested last month on suspicion of recruiting volunteers to travel to Syria to fight for Isil. The flatmate was one of several men arrested simultaneously, including an extremist preacher called Abu Walaa, known as “the faceless preacher” because he refused to face the camera in videos.
The suspect is believed to have been in contact with Walaa, one of the few extremist preachers in Germany openly to declare his support for Isil, and the group of arrested men.
In another disclosure that raises questions about the police investigation, it was revealed that the Pakistani asylum seeker initially held as a suspect was targeted because he accidentally jumped a red light.
Naved Baluch, 23, who arrived in Germany a year ago, was seized after witnesses saw him commit a traffic offence a mile away from the crime scene. Detectives who flew him out of Berlin and across the country to Karlsruhe to question him, took 18 hours to release Mr Baluch, who had no blood on his clothes and no injuries.
It was only then the security services warned the public that the real killer was on the run with a gun. “We declared victory too soon,” said one investigator.
David Videcette, a former Scotland Yard counter terrorism officer who worked on the London 7/7 investigation, said Britain was better at preventing plots because there was better collaboration between the police and security services and they had learnt the lessons of the past.
He said: “After the 7/7 bomb attacks and particularly the 21/7 incident when Jean Charles de Menezes was shot, the UK took a very close look at the way everything operated.
“Prior to that, you had the Security Service on one side, the police on the other and Special Branch in the middle deciding what information was being passed between the two. After the attacks on London it was recognised that this relationship was not working and things were going wrong. Now the police and Security Service talk to one another and share information and that is one of the reasons we are successful in stopping plots.
“In Germany however, in common with other mainland European countries, they are a long way behind. There are numerous agencies operating in the same space and this creates problems. Information is not shared and things get missed.”
Germany’s strict privacy laws initially prevented pictures of Amri being published there, or even his surname. Instead media outlets in the country had to obscure his eyes in photographs and call him Anis A until the authorities decided to publish an unredacted wanted notice describing him as “highly dangerous”.
State surveillance is a sensitive issue in Germany because of extensive snooping by the Stasi secret police in Communist East Germany and by the Gestapo in the Nazi era.
However, on Wednesday a bill was passed to allow more video surveillance in German society with greater weight given to “the protection of life, health and freedom”.
As dramatic accounts of near-escapes by survivors of the attack continued to emerge, an Italian man said he “looked death in the face” and it was a “miracle” he and his wife survived.
Giuseppe La Grassa, 34, was on holiday celebrating his wedding anniversary and his birthday and described how close his wife Elisabetta came to being killed.
He said: “It is miracle my wife is alive. She was about to go and get a sandwich, but then she delayed a moment and was passed by a girl. The girl was killed, run down by the lorry.”
It said: “This is Berlin. We are Berlin. We ride the S-Bahn in the rush hour. We complain when people are friendly to us. Our taxi drivers are more dangerous than any converts... and we love our children like crazy, even if they are lactose-intolerant. Whatever that is. We have nine months of winter and we go straight to work from partying. Some of us are Turks. Or Russians. Or Americans. Pakistanis too. Scared of you?! Dream on.”
BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner has told the News Channel that the encounter with Anis Amri was "probably more than luck".
"Italy was on alert for this guy, he had spent four years in Italy mostly in jail, and he was known already to the Italian authorities," he said.
"He probably made a mistake going back to Italy, he would have been probably trying to hide himself in the suburbs or indeed trying to get himself over to Syria.
Railway tickets found on Amri's body showed he had travelled from Chambery in south-eastern France to Turin and then on to Milan, Italy's Ansa news agency says.
'It's all too convenient': Questions over how police missed Berlin attack suspect's ID in truck for 24 hours - as it emerges far-right leader 'KNEW attacker was a Tunisian Muslim' hours after the atrocity
A far-right leader in Germany knew the suspect in the Christmas market attack was a Tunisian just two hours after the attack - despite police initially arresting a Pakistani man, it has emerged.
Lutz Bachmann, who fronts the anti-immigrant PEGIDA group, tweeted on Monday night that he had 'internal police information' about the nationality of the lorry driver who murdered 12 revellers in Berlin.
At the time, police had announced the arrest of a Pakistani asylum seeker - it was only when he was released that Tunisian Anis Amri was publicly identified as the chief suspect.
It comes as conspiracy theories surfaced online questioning how police missed the suspect's ID in the truck for 24 hours.

Lutz Bachmann, who fronts the anti-immigrant PEGIDA group, tweeted on Monday night that he had 'internal police information' about the nationality of the lorry driver who murdered 12 revellers in Berlin
When asked to explain how he knew this information, he wrote in a follow-up tweet: 'Just need the right connections and a whistleblower that is sick of the lies.'
Controversial Bachmann tweeted his information on Monday night - before police officially confirmed that they were hunting a Tunisian suspect.
Meanwhile, conspiracy theorists have questioned the 'suspicious' discovery of the Berlin attack suspect's wallet in the lorry used to murder 12 people at a packed Christmas market.
German police named Anis Amri as the chief suspect in the attack after finding his ID - apparently abandoned by the asylum seeker in the footwell of the truck as he fled the scene.

'....Just one day later, the Berliner Morgenpost and RBB published the results of their research. This is based on internal investigations and statements by the co-defendants’ attorneys in the Abu Walaa trial. The charges against Abu Walaa and other suspected Islamists in further terrorist trials are mainly based on the statements of the undercover state agent.
Most of the group members had wanted to leave for Syria to fight on the side of Islamic State (IS). They had not spoken about attacks in Germany. Agent “Murat” had several times said to members of the group: “Come on, you don’t have a passport anyway, do something here, carry out an attack.”
In a police interrogation in December last year, a former supporter of an Islamist group had already warned about a man named “Murat.” He was “extremely radical,” the witness said, according to information from those close to the investigation. “Murat” had also repeatedly said that one needed good men “who are able to carry out attacks.”
In a further interrogation, the witness is reported to have said that “Murat” wanted to talk more about Kalashnikovs than about prayers. When he saw youngsters and parents in a meadow, he said “they had to be killed because they denied God.”
A former supporter of the Abu Walaa group told RBB that “Murat” was “the most radical.” A former member of the Islamist scene—it is unclear whether it is the same man—reaffirmed to RBB reporters that “Murat” had prompted him to carry out attacks: “I can testify 100 percent that he also tried to do this with me.”
Several lawyers confirm the allegations. “My client has reported to me that VP-01 talked to him about possible attack locations and gave him the tip to shave off his beard so that he attracted less attention,” the Düsseldorf defence lawyer Johannes Pausch said. His client was sentenced to imprisonment for planning an attack. “Murat” had not sought to slow down his client, who was then a minor, but had “insisted” he act, he said.....'
Aurora also known as SR-91 Aurora is the popular name for a hypothesized American reconnaissance aircraft, believed by some to be capable of hypersonic flight at speeds of Mach 5+. According to the hypothesis, Aurora was developed in the 1980s or 1990s as a replacement for the aging and expensive SR-71 Blackbird.
A British Ministry of Defence report released in May 2006 refers to USAF priority plans to produce a Mach 4-6 highly supersonic vehicle, but no conclusive evidence had emerged to confirm the existence of such a project. It was believed by some that the Aurora project was canceled due to a shift from spy-planes to high-tech unmanned aerial vehicles and reconnaissance satellites which can do the same job as a spyplane, but with less risk of casualties.
The main question here is, Does the US Air Force or America’s intelligence agencies have a secret hypersonic aircraft capable of a Mach 6 performance?. The continually growing evidence suggests that the answer to this question is YES. Perhaps the most well-known instance which provides evidence of such an aircraft’s existence is the sighting of a triangular plane over the North Sea in August 1989 by oil-exploration engineer Chris Gibson. As well as the famous “skyquakes” heard over Los Angeles since the early 1990s, found to be heading for the secret Groom Lake (Area 51) installation in the Nevada desert, numerous other facts provide an understanding of how the aircraft’s technology works. Rumored to exist but routinely denied by U.S. officials, the name of this aircraft is Aurora.
The outside world uses the name Aurora because a censor’s slip let it appear below the SR-71 Blackbird and U-2 in the 1985 Pentagon budget request. Even if this was the actual name of the project, it would have by now been changed after being compromised in such a manner.
The plane’s real name has been kept a secret along with its existence. This is not unfamiliar though, the F-117a stealth fighter was kept a secret for over ten years after its first pre-production test flight. The project is what is technically known as a Special Access Program (SAP). More often, such projects are referred to as “black programs.”
So what was the first sign of the existence of SR-91 Aurora ? On 6 March 1990, one of the United States Air Force’s Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird spyplanes shattered the official air speed record from Los Angeles to Washington’s Dulles Airport. There, a brief ceremony marked the end of the SR-71’s operational career. Officially, the SR-71 was being retired to save the $200-$300 million a year it cost to operate the fleet. Some reporters were told the plane had been made redundant by sophisticated spy satellites.
Soaring at 5,000 miles per hour through the night sky these unidentified flying objects could be a 21st century addition to NATO's airforce. Radar stations at Prestwick, West Freugh and RAF Buchan may have tracked their movements as they fly between secret airbases and the Norwegian Fjords, but the Ministry of Defence and the US Air Force deny they even exist.
ALMOST invisible to radar, the F-117 Stealth fighter is one of the most sophisticated warplanes ever built.
But for seven years the US Government denied that the top- secret aircraft - nicknamed Nighthawk - existed.
Ranging the night skies over Baghdad on 1,270 missions the Nighthawks struck the most heavily defended Iraqi targets to stunning effect.
Now from the cloak of X-Files denial comes a Stealth successor: more powerful, blacker, faster and even more secret.
Under the codename Project Aurora - which may be a wrap for several secret aircraft - the planes are classified within the US defence department's black programme - one whose existence is not admitted by the authorities.
Experts claim experimental and prototype Aurora aircraft are using Scotland, the skies above the North Sea and the wilderness areas of far-Northern Europe as their testing ground.
Bill Sweetman, former technical editor for Jane's Information Group and an author of three books on Stealth technology claims the areas are ideal proving ranges.
He claims that after 17 years the US defence department is reaching the latter stages of trialing space-age military aircraft capable of astonishing speeds.
"There continues to be a huge black hole in what we know the Pentagon has spent money on," he told the Press and Journal.
"In 1999 black projects accounted for $12.1 billion of USAF research expenditure - that is almost 40% of the $32 billion research and development budget."
Advanced secret aircraft developed at highly classified Government facilities in the Nevada Desert almost certainly include both manned and unmanned hypersonic jets designed to perform strategic reconnaissance and other less conventional missions for the US Air Force and its NATO allies.
A number of these aircraft have been seen and heard by ground- based and airborne observers in the western USA and in northern Europe during the past 10 years.
Based on more than 60 eye-witness reports there appears to be at least three distinct types of vehicle:
One is a "triangular-shaped quiet aircraft" observed with a fleet of Stealth fighters several times between 1989 and 1995. This may be a demonstrator or prototype of the much vaunted McDonnell Douglas A-12.
Another is a high speed aeroplane characterised by a very loud, deep rumbling roar, reminiscent of heavy-lift space rockets. In flight it makes a pulsing sound and leaves a segmented vapour trail.
The final contender is a high altitude jet that crosses the night sky at extremely high speed and at altitudes in excess of 50,000 feet. It is usually observed as single bright light but no engine noise or sonic boom is heard.
In one seven month period a small team of observers in California logged at least 30 sonic booms believed to be produced by the same unknown aircraft.
Claims have surfaced that booms from Aurora test flights are responsible for sudden avalanches in Norway and an earthquake in the Netherlands as well as unexplained radar blips, eerie noises and isolated UFO sightings in Scotland.
Reporters from Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten say they have received numerous complaints of sudden bass-like booms from isolated fishing communities and farmsteads between Trondheim and Narvik, followed by sudden avalanches of snow.
They say that recently released information suggests that a 1986 avalanche in the Troms area of northern Norway, which killed 16 NATO soldiers, may have been triggered by early tests of a secret supersonic jet.
The P and J understands that Norwegian Government officials are now concerned about Aurora flights, damage caused by sonic booms and the lack of consultation from their US NATO allies.
An Oslo-based Government spokesman said they were carrying out long-standing research into the causes of avalanches and they were aware of the concern over test flights by military aircraft from the UK.
"We always receive a number of complaints from people over low- flying aircraft and sonic booms - and it is probably true that some sonic booms cause avalanches," he added.
Dutch scientists have meanwhile blamed the secret jet for causing a sudden earth tremor which jolted the north coast of the Netherlands.
A North-east RAF base recently traced a very fast radar blip across the North Sea. But when the incident was reported to RAF Buchan, superior officers denied all knowledge of it.
Oceanic Air Traffic Control at Prestwick also tracked fast- moving radar blips. It was claimed by staff that a "hypersonic jet was the only rational conclusion" for the readings.
Experts claim the Aurora has probably flown out of RAF Machrihanish airfield in Argyll while hi-tech tracking equipment at Benbecula, RAE West Freugh in Galloway and Fylingdales monitor its progress.
There have been reports of unidentified night-time aircraft noises from Machrihanish for a number of years.
But with the Kintyre base now downgraded to a care and maintenance position, experts are puzzled about the location of the Aurora's new European test base.
"The information currently available shows Scotland and the North Sea are used extensively for the testing of these aircraft," he said.
Mr Hickling, who for nine years covered science and manned space for the Gannet Newspapers Washington bureau, added: "I believe it is extremely likely that the aircraft - test beds for hypersonic engine and control technology - would be unmanned, because human bodies could not stand the G forces generated by manoeuvres at hypersonic speed."
But last night Bill Sweetman said high speed - such as at Mach 7 or 8 - would not exclude manned aircraft. "It is only when you manoeuvre an aircraft at that speed that G forces come into play," he said.
Mr Sweetman said the development of the Aurora within the US defence department's "black projects" was a natural progression from the Stealth fighter, which first flew in 1982.
"The evidence is strong that high speed propulsion and aerodynamics are at the cutting edge of this new development and the long runways at Groom Lake (USA) and Machrihanish would be ideal to fly the plane from."
He said the skeleton staff at the "care and maintenance" RAF Machrihanish would be a perfect cover for further trialing of Aurora aircraft.
"One of the missions of high altitude supersonic aircraft was to operate over the North Atlantic as a reconnaissance strike system against the Soviet Northern Fleet and it would be natural to continue that test range despite the end of the cold war."
The ultimate in aerodynamics the aircraft could reach anywhere in the world in three hours, he claimed.
However an MoD spokesman said last night: "There are no United States Air Force prototype aircraft based at British airbases and no authorisation has been given by Her Majesty's Government to the USAF - or any other US body - to operate such aircraft within or from the United Kingdom.
A spokesman for the US defence department denied any knowledge of Aurora or "Deep Black" aircraft. Mr Sweetman said it was natural for British and US military spokesman to deny the existence of the plane.
"Put it this way," he said, "In 1988 the US Air Force had 50 F- 117 Stealth aircraft operating in Nevada and still denied they existed."
So secret, its existence is not even acknowledged: Futuristic 'Aurora' spy plane that travels at SIX TIMES the speed of sound is blamed for mysterious booms heard at the weekend
The top-secret Aurora project was first first reported on in 1989 and it could be behind Lockheed Martin's SR-72 plane concept
The origin of the mysterious bangs heard across the UK and New York at the weekend are yet to be officially identified.
But a leading theory is that they were created by an aircraft possibly travelling at supersonic or hypersonic speeds above the Atlantic.
This has led conspiracy theorists to attribute the booms to a spy plane rumoured to be under development by the US military, under the codename Aurora.
Theory: Aurora is rumoured to be a top secret aircraft in development since 1989. Last year Lockheed Martin announced it was developing a similar SR-72 spy plane (illustrated) said to be able to accelerate up to Mach 6	+8
Aurora is rumoured to be a top secret aircraft that has been in development since 1989. These claims originated in Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine in 1989. In November 2013, Lockheed Martin announced it was developing a similar SR-72 spy plane (illustrated) said to be able to accelerate up to Mach 6
Dr Bhupendra Khandelwal, an engineering research associate from Sheffield, claims the loud bangs were created by a type of experimental jet engine called a pulse detonation engine.
Claudia Angiletta, a resident from Croydon, South London, recorded the sounds as she was watching TV at home at around 10pm GMT on Saturday.
Within minutes, Twitter users had started spreading hashtags - from the straightforward #loudbangs to the somewhat melodramatic #omgwereallgoingtodie.
At around the same time, residents in locations including Buffalo, Cheektowaga, Clarence and as far north as Niagara Falls on the east coast of the US also took to social media to report the unusual noises.
It's conceivable that with that sort of power, speed, and altitude, the sound would carry over a vast distance. #hypersonic #loudbangs
The continuous noise and odd sound it makes would then be explained by reverberations around the stratosphere. #loudbang #hypersonic
It seems to me that everyone has ruled out sonic booms, no one is considering hypersonic booms, both US & China developing it #loudbangs
Twitter user Brailsford believes the noises were created by hypersonic booms (tweets pictured above). He added that the continuous and odd sound could be explained by reverberations around the stratosphere
Could it be? An artist's image of the so-called Aurora project. Enthusiasts say one possible power source is a 'pulse detonation engine', whose sound is said to resemble that caught on an audio clip on Saturday	+8
Enthusiasts claim that such a supersonic or hypersonic plans could be what caused the strange noises at the weekend. In particular, an expert said the sound is similar to that created by pulse detonation engines. An artist's illustration of what the Aurora plane could look like is pictured
This has led conspiracy theorists to claim the power source could be behind a hypersonic US spy plane, dubbed Aurora.
It could be a successor to the Mach 3.35 Lockheed Martin SR-71 Blackbird craft that was retired in 1998.
These claims originated in Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine, which ran an article in 1989 about a a mysterious entry in the 1985 US budget.
It said the plane can accelerate up to Mach 6, or 4,567mph (7,349km/h) - three times faster than Concorde.
These claims originated in Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine, which ran an article in 1989 about a mysterious entry in the 1985 US budget.
The firm was said to be looking into replacing its SR-71 Blackbird, which was later retired in 1998.
However, the former head of Lockheed's Skunkworks division, Ben Rich, said Aurora was a codename for the stealth project which eventually led to the B-2 Spirit.
But, in November 2013, Lockheed Martin announced it was developing a spy plane with similar technologies called SR-72.
The firm said the plane can accelerate up to Mach 6, or 4,567mph (7,349km/h) - three times faster than Concorde.
Concorde flew no faster than Mach 2, primarily because the materials weren’t available in the Sixties that could withstand greater heat.
Technology has advanced since then, and the SR-72 will be a so-called ‘warm structure’ - it will heat up rather than reflect the heat using the sort of ceramic tiles that covered the Space Shuttle.
Concorde wasn’t allowed to fly supersonic over land because of the ‘sonic boom’ - the sound associated with the shockwaves created by a craft moving faster than the speed of sound.

A PDE engine works by using force from a series of explosions, caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake, to thrust itself forward. Its contrails appear to look like 'rings on a rope' (pictured), or a spine	+8
A PDE engine works by using force from a series of explosions, caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake, to thrust itself forward. It can theoretically power planes at five times the speed of sound. A PDE can detonate between 60 and 100 times a second and its contrails appear to look like 'rings on a rope' (pictured), or a spine
According to experts, including Dr Phillip Atcliffe, senior lecturer in aeronautical engineering at Salford University, if a passenger jet flew at Mach 6 at current jet altitudes of around 30,000ft (9,144 metres), the sonic boom could damage buildings.
Officials routinely deny Aurora exists. But that has not dampened the spirits of the theorists, who point to a sighting of a mysterious triangular object by a North Sea oil engineer in August 1989.
Dr Khandelwal was keen to distance himself from the world of conspiracy theories, though he conceded there could always some things unknown to the public.
Dr Khandelwal, is among a team of scientists working on the technology behind such types of 'pulse detonation engine'.
Engine: There are a number of possible engine technologies that have been linked to the Aurora project.
In November 2013, Lockheed Martin announced it was developing for its SR-72 spy plane (pictured) said to be able to accelerate up to Mach 6	+8

One in particular, which Dr Bhupendra Khandelwal an engineering research associate from Sheffield believes may have caused the booms heard over the UK and New York, is called a pulse detonation engine (PDE), or pulse detonation wave engine (PDWE).
At regular speeds, the craft would be powered by a traditional jet engines built into the lower fuselage.
A PDE works by sending liquid methane or liquid hydrogen into the engine. The fuel mist is then ignited.
This detonation is made inside a specially designed chamber and occurs when the aircraft is travelling beyond the speed of sound.
When the detonation occurs, the aircraft's thrust wall is pushed forward, and this is repeated numerous times to propel the aircraft forward.
Alternatively, pulsejets could compress the air caused as the craft travels forward to make it more streamline, while fuel is ignited in a combustion chamber.
Weapons: Rumours claim the Aurora may be equipped with air-to-ground weapons, but this would add weight to the craft, suggesting it is more likely that the plane would be used to reach destinations and reconnaissance missions instead.
‘When we run a test engine it’s a real industrial noise and you can hear it for miles. We have people coming to us asking to make less noise or keep it to the daytime.'
A PDE engine works by using the force from a series of explosions, caused by mixing a fuel mist and air intake, to thrust itself forward. It can theoretically power planes at five times the speed of sound.
The technology builds upon 'pulsejet' principles which first emerged in the early 1900s and were used in German V-1 flying bombs.
Test flights using the most recent forms of the technology have lasted only a few seconds, but it is still listed by conspiracy theorists as a possible way of powering the so-called Aurora spy jet.

Steven Aftergood, a government secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists, said: 'If an aircraft is responsible, then it’s worth noting that it may not be local at all.
'Because the sound wave that causes the boom can be reflected by the stratosphere, the source of the event could conceivably be hundreds or thousands of miles away from the place where it is heard on the ground.'
But Dr Andrew Taylor, a senior lecturer in aviation at Buckinghamshire New University, said the noises did not sound like a normal sonic boom.
A supersonic plane is one that flies faster than the speed of sound, at Mach 1 or greater, using a jet engine.
Mach 2.5 is about the speed limit for gas-turbine engines. Any faster and the temperature and pressure of air entering the engine is too high for the turbo machinery inside.
To fly at hypersonic speed - Mach 5 and above - requires a different type of engine such as a supersonic-combustion ramjet, or scramjet.
These engines have no moving parts. Instead of the rotating compressor and turbine in a jet engine, air is compressed and expanded by complex systems of shockwaves under the front of the aircraft, inside the inlet and under the fuselage at the rear.
Travel becomes hypersonic when temperatures get so hot that air molecules become unstable and begin losing electrons. At these speeds the air becomes an electrically-charged field.
At supersonic speeds, air moves through a series of channels until is slowed down to a point where fuel can be more easily injected and ignited. This releases energy and thrust.
At hypersonic speed, this air moves even faster, which makes it difficult to slow down to the speed of sound and therefore requires specialist fuel and technologies, as seen in engines including the pulse detonation engine (PDE).
Air reacts like a fluid to supersonic objects. As objects travel through the air, molecules are pushed aside with great force and this forms a shock wave much like a boat creates a bow wave. The width of the so-called boom 'carpet' beneath the aircraft is around one mile (1.6km) for each 1,000ft (304 metres) of altitude	+8

The sonic boom is created when an aircraft or other type of vehicle flies overhead faster than the speed of sound.
Air reacts like a fluid to supersonic objects. As objects travel through the air, the air molecules are pushed aside with great force and this forms a shock wave much like a boat creates a bow wave. The bigger and heavier the aircraft, the more air it displaces.
The width of the so-called boom 'carpet' beneath the aircraft is around one mile (1.6km) for every 100ft (30.5 metres) of altitude.
An aircraft, for example, flying supersonic at 50,000ft (15,240 metres) can produce a sonic boom cone about 50 miles (80km) wide.
The maximum intensity is heard directly beneath the aircraft, and this decreases as the lateral distance from the flight path increases until it ceases to exist because the shock waves refract away from the ground.
The spread of the sonic boom depends only upon altitude, speed and the atmosphere - and is independent of the vehicle's shape, size, and weight.
Although the speed at which it was travelling, and its location above the Atlantic could reduce this altitude and spread.
Meanwhile, Professor Trevor Cox, an acoustic engineer from Salford University told MailOnline: 'To have heard a noise simultaneously in New York and the UK, the source of the sound must have been flying half way between.
'That's an awful long way - about 4,000 miles. You do get cases of sounds travelling a long way, for example, in 2005, sounds from the Buncefield fire travelled around 125 miles to Belgium.
'With smaller fighter jets just a single boom would be heard, or, as with Concorde, a "double boom" might be heard from larger aircraft as both the nose and tail cause shock waves,' he said.
'It sounds like gunfire or other ammunition, similar to what I used to hear as a child growing up in Lincolnshire when the RAF and USAF aircraft used to do bombing runs on the east coast bombing ranges.
Scramjets have been under development for decades, but a breakthrough came in May 2013, when the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory’s Boeing X-51A WaveRider flew for 240 seconds over the Pacific on scramjet power, reaching Mach 5.1 and running until its fuel was exhausted.
Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works - builder of the Mach 3.5 SR-71 Blackbird spyplane - then unveiled plans to develop a successor, dubbed the SR-72, pictured
The next step is to build a high-speed cruise missile, able to strike distant targets in minutes, not hours.
Designed for reconnaissance and strike missions, the SR-72 would combine turbojet and ramjet/scramjet engines to enable the aircraft to take off from a runway, accelerate to a Mach 6 cruise, and then return to a conventional runway landing.
If it can secure funding from the U.S. Defense Department, Lockheed Martin believes a prototype could be flying as soon as 2023 and the SR-72 could enter service by 2030, potentially paving the way for commercial applications of scramjet technology.
Many Twitter users suspected sonic booms, similar to ones which shook Kent last month when two RAF jets intercepted a Latvian cargo plane in British airspace.
But a Ministry of Defence spokesman told MailOnline last night she had no records of any jets being scrambled.
Others suggested unusual weather conditions might be the source, but the Met Office dismissed those claims and said there was nothing out of the ordinary.
The Metropolitan Police said there had been a fireworks display in Croydon, but Twitter users insisted that could not explain sounds in Bedfordshire, Glasgow, North Devon, Leicestershire and West Sussex.
At around the same time, a loud boom was reported by a number of people in the upstate New York areas of Buffalo, Cheektowaga and Clarence more than 3,000 miles away.
But Brian Baptie, seismologist at the British Geological Survey told MailOnline: 'Micro earthquakes are small.
'Usually too small for people to feel and it’s extremely unlikely that the noises were caused by this.
'Even small earthquakes some have audible phenomenon. For example, the Folkestone earthquake of 2007, that had a magnitude of 4.3, had a loud booming noise.
'This is because the vibrations travel through the ground, and when this is coupled with the atmosphere it generates sound waves that can be heard over a large distance.
Reaction: There was an explosion of activity on Twitter, where some users came up with their own theories
Many of the reports were picked up by Twitter user Virtual Astronomer (pictured), who said space debris re-entering the earth's atmosphere could have been responsible. He also said he was convinced the noises were created by aircraft sonic booms
One possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere, which would result in a sonic boom - a claim backed by expert Dr Caroline Smith	+8
One possible explanation is that the loud noise and ground shaking could have been a meteorite breaking up in the atmosphere, which would result in a sonic boom - but this was dismissed by another expert
'It’s a well-known phenomenon and happens for big earthquakes, but if this was the case it would have been felt as well, too, so it is unlikely the booms would just be down to an earthquake.'
Ms Angiletta, who recorded the sounds told MailOnline: 'I was just at home watching TV when I couldn't hear the program due to the loud noises. It was very distracting as it went on for ages.
'I went out to look for fireworks but I couldn't see anything in the sky. That's when I recorded the clip to send to my family to see if they could hear the same thing.'
The 27-year-old said that her family, who live roughly seven miles away in Norbury, south London, could also hear the sounds, which lasted for about 30 minutes. She then turned to Twitter to see if anyone could explain what they were.

Many of the reports were picked up by Twitter user Virtual Astronomer, who said space debris re-entering the earth's atmosphere could have been responsible.
'Space debris such as old satellites and things can cause sonic booms heard over very large areas,' he told MailOnline. 'It's the same for big meteors or rocks that come in.
'There was very little wind last night so conditions were perfect for sound to travel very long distances.'
He told MailOnline that there was one piece of debris from Russian satellite Kosmos 2251 scheduled for re-entry, but said that the timing was 'not a good fit' for it to have been over the UK.
He added: 'I do not think it was a meteor or a piece of space-junk, as the noises mentioned spanned a large segment of time. Plus, unless it was cloudy over the U.K., there would've been visual sightings.
Dave Reed, who lives in Fareham, Hampshire, said his dogs 'went crazy for a couple of minutes' after hearing what he had assumed were fireworks.
Twitter user Carrie Proctor wrote: 'This is how we'll find our that WW3 has begun. It'll be a Twitter hashtag long before any official announcement!'
Hyacinth Fahsi, who lives in Grimbergen, near Brussels, said the sound at 11pm local time - the same time as it was heard in Britain - woke his daughter and matched the recording in Croydon.
Describing the sound as 'repetitive explosions', he said: 'I first thought it was firework but it was different. Maybe thunder, but the sky was clear and I didn't see lightning, even far away.

"A year has past and now we stand on the brink, of returning to a world where we are surrounded by the paradox of everything and yet nothing being the same.
In a couple of weeks we will reluctantly give our hugs and, fighting the tears,we will say goodbye to people who were once just names on a sheet of paper to return to people that we hugged and fought tears to say goodbye to before we ever left....
We will go back to the places we came from, and go back to the same things we did last summer and every summer before.
We will come into town on that same familiar road, and even though it has been months, it will seem like only yesterday.
As you walk into your old bedroom, every emotion will pass through you as you reflect on the way your life has changed and the person you have become.
You suddenly realize that the things that were most important to you a year ago don't seem to matter so much anymore, and the things you hold highest now, no one at home will completely understand.
Then you start to realize how much things have changed, and you realize the hardest part of being an exchange student is balancing the two completely different worlds you now live in, trying desperately to hold on to everything all the while trying to figure out what you have to leave behind.
We've had our hearts broken, we've fell in love, we've helped our best friends overcome eating disorders, depression, stress, and death.
We've lit candles at the grotto and we've stayed up all night on the phone just to talk to a friend in need.
There have been times when we've felt so helpless being hours away from home when we know our families or friends needed us the most, and there are times when we know we have made a difference.
We will leave our friends whose random e-mails and phone calls will bring us to laughter and tears this summer, and hopefully years to come.
We will take our memories and dreams and put them away for now, saving them for our return to this world.Just weeks from now we will arrive.
We will drive over to our best friend's house and do nothing for hours on end.We will return to the same friends whose random emails and phone calls have brought us to laughter and tears over the year.
In just weeks we will dig deep inside to find the strength and conviction to adjust to change and still keep each other close.

The façade in plates of layered hardened structural glass is split horizontally and devoid of frame 3 Entrance from Via Piacenza. It is the main front of the new initiative 078-089 ABDR.indd 81 The complex equilibrium between past and present is a predominant component of the urban and architectural structure in the city of Rome. Within this intricate context distinguished by the presence of constructions from different epochs, a project for upgrading and architectural adaptation of Palazzo delle Esposizioni in Via Nazionale, and in particular of the former Serra Piacentini, is now being carried out on the existing reality. The ancient/modern duality is assumed as objective aimed at valorizing the new architectural element inserted in Palazzo delle Esposizioni, designed in the late 19th century by Pio Piacentini. The project, by the group of Roman architects ABDR, provides for rebuilding the former greenhouse in a contemporary key, in compliance with the requisites of the Salvaging Plan approved by the Municipal Administration. In the design, the accent is placed on functional, technological and formal integration, especially of the glass, predominantly used as material, combined with the light metal structure, with travertine, and with wood, to create an effect of transparency and intangibility. The other aspect of contemporary interest regards the study of environmental feasibility and in particular bioclimatic performance and energy savings. In planimetry, the project involves the terminal part of the building, consisting of a three-part rectangular section destined to the services and kitchens, a restaurant area and an entrance void lateral to the exhibition area distinguished by a spatial and three-dimensional play of wooden surfaces that emphasizes the double height and leads the gaze upward. Three different levels are determined by the three sectioned areas. From the height of the exhibition level and the entrance, iron stairs lead to the restaurant, then on to the terrace above the wooden dado of the kitchens, looking to the outside. The bearing structure consists of a trilithic system of nine steel columns per side with diameter ranging from 120 to 200mm on the short sides, and arriving at 400mm on the long side. The facades of the great parallelepiped are split horizontally, modularly defining in height the new volume of the greenhouse, whose ceiling arrives at the stringcourse of the existing structure. The minimal language adopted identifies elementary spatial figures that do not contrast with the purist forms of the exhibition building. The intersection of several elementary forms, of different material consistency, establishes a hierarchy of weights and measures recognizable according to five volumetric typologies. The great glazed parallelepiped, the ceiling defined by big metal arches, the block containing the services, the cube containing the kitchens and the volume of the exhibition area and the entrance from Via Milano, located 19-12-2007 9:38:56

With a new album out this year (“Anthem”, see review on these pages), Madeleine is back with a pretty strong one.
Much anguish, reluctance, crestfallen? Are you want to know what herbs are good for anxiety and depression? Try these home[…]
This 20 minute performance dealt with the reality and made up reality, or rather reality imposed on us.
During the performance, texts were read from the Georgian Cosmopolitan magazine listing down tips about how to make your body seem more desirable, more beautiful, how high heels can make you look better or how to judge men’s sexual potential according to his mobile telephone.
The billboard stating “Georgians, forwards to the King Agmashenebelis Georgia!” refers to an absurd wish of a Georgian society to reverse development of our country to the past, the performance demonstrated that reality can be much more absurd then art.
' Georgians! Let's move forward to Agmashenebeli King! ' - this phrase was written on one of the bill boards on the high way. It reflects very well political processes in Georgia, we have an aim to move forward to west, but in the same time we have nationalistic nostalgia of the 12th century, when Georgian Kingdom was influential in Caucasian region. We want to build democracy, but we need a strong leader, who will take responsibility and bring country to the prosperity, when we meanwhile can happily stay in the fairytale world.
In 2005 Sophia Tabatadze (1977, visual arts) and Nadia Tsulukidze (1976, performing arts/contemporary dance) started working together and combining different art disciplines. These are visual, media, movement, music and speech art forms combined in polyphonic way. In our performance/installations different disciplines play equal roles. The forms are there to supplement and support content and form rather than illustrate or decorate each other. The performances are always site-specific. Each performance is different depending on their reaction as well as characteristics of the space we use. Given that in the past few years borders between different disciplines within the contemporary art became thinner relevance and importance to create interdisciplinary projects grew. The themes of performances deal with social events surrounding us. The problems are not approached directly and aggressively but they go through the artistic processes and gain weight, humor and importance as we go along. The dramaturgy is based on the abstract principle and develops during the working process, mirroring specific social situations. We do not use written scenario beforehand. The themes like male-female dependence, cultural and professional habits, questioning the Georgian toasting traditions, growing importance of the religion in Georgia, the blind copy-pasting from the West etc. are worked on and brought into the discussion.

Next, research individual affiliate programs to compare their structure. You want to consider factors such as how much the commission is and how often the affiliate pays. Also, make sure you understand what rules, if any, a company imposes for being a part of its affiliate program. Additionally, you're likely to make more money with affiliate marketing content that is similar to your own.
What’s the catch? None, really. Cash back apps act as affiliates for many online merchants, which means that whenever you make a purchase through one of the apps, they get a small commission — but then, they give you a portion of that commission as “cash back”. For example, if I buy a pair of Nike shoes through the Ebates app (or website) and spend $75, Ebates may get a $10 commission but then they’ll pass $7 back to me. It’s basically a way to get sale prices on stuff that isn’t on sale!
Matched Betting (not available in the USA) enables you to gamble (nearly) risk-free. I say nearly as there is always room for error! It involves placing bets on all outcomes of an event, using free online bets given out by the Bookies. Although it may take a while to get your head around the concept, Matched Betting can make a substantial addition to your monthly income.
Take surveys. You can earn $50 to $100 per month in cash and products by taking online surveys. Find survey sites by searching for “paid survey sites” online. Sign up for several survey sites to increase your chances of being selected for higher-paying surveys. Register with an email address, and check your email often so you can respond quickly to survey offers.
Sponsored posts work much in the same way as paid guest posts, but they are posted by big businesses instead of individual bloggers. Therefore, the scope for fees is much higher, as businesses have larger marketing budgets than humble bloggers. Having sponsored posts by large companies will also help promote your site as reputable and as a leader in its field.
WP Rich Snippets – premium plugin that adds rich snippets (eg. review stars) to your snippets. You get 33% of sales and it’s what I use on my site. I recommend it over the All In One Schema.org plugin as it looks nicer with more settings and add-ons. Here’s a post I used it on. If you’re writing reviews as part of your strategy, get this for yourself.
Banners – after testing them out I decided to take down my banner ads since they looked salesy and weren’t working like my affiliate links did. They’re easy to throw up, but distracting and probably won’t get great results. If you try them, be sure to show specific sidebar banners based on the type of content people are reading on your blog (for posts that fall under my SEO category I would show a banner related to SEO, and for posts under my website speed category I would show a different banner). You can do this using a plugin like Widget Logic.
On the other hand: the main reason of bankruptcy for small businesses is bad financial management. Simply said: to forget to make invoices, not checking the payments and not following bad payers. 1 out of 3 is going bankrupt for this reason alone. I had to learn it myself. I spend at least 10% of my time with financial stuff. I don’t love it but the bills get payed ;-)
The peer-to-peer concept is coming to virtually every corner of human existence. That includes the hospitality industry. Through AirBnB you can actually rent out your house for various lengths of time for a predetermined fee. That gives you an extra income on your house and gives the visitor the benefit of having an entire house, rather than being crammed into a single hotel room.
Clickbank itself has a good reputation and payments are always on time. As an affiliate, it is your responsibility to do research before you choose to promote a program to avoid disappointment with chargebacks or customer complaints. As a Vendor, you should create a product that will deliver quality to customers and marketing materials to affiliates.
When you promote a product you also promote the person or the company who is behind the product so try to choose wisely. You don’t want your visitors to go and buy a product following your advice then come back unhappy. Do you think that this visitor will come back to your site and take your advice again? Most likely no; this can hurt your credibility in the long run. Usually, websites/company that offer good customer service will have better customer satisfaction so try to stick with promoting their products.
these are certainly well known ways of making money with affiliate marketing…the best example i can give is rahul kuntala of learnblogtips.com, he has created an ebook and also has a landing page as you suggested! i would also specify bharat mandava of wpsquare.com, who earns most of his income through affiliate marketing!! thx fr the article jafar :)
ps. collecting these Facebook polls is one of the main reasons I was able to get so many SiteGround sales. Yes, I’m suggesting SiteGround for your host, but this is also a strategy that can be used to collect unbiased reviews. Just go to Facebook and search “SiteGround poll” and you can dig up some great stuff – you can do this with lots of affiliate products/companies.
Christene this is s concise, succinct description of the Clickbank system. I was wondering though- how common is it to be both a vendor and an affiliate ? I have been exploring/researching this online business model for what seems like an eternity and need to be mindful of information overload. So many of the 'authorities' out there distribute the exact same info wrapped in various styles of 'wrapping paper' but with the same goal of enticing you into one of their 'make you a millionaire' training courses, to be honest I've become quite cynical and - need I say - suspicious ??? You never hear about any of their sign ups that "failed" at whatever genre they were promoting - only the success stories. For me, I would give more credibility to someone who was prepared to show the 'real/honest' side of these courses/workshops/programmes that they all so brilliantly offer. Is there ANYWHERE that statistics or even some form of research findings could be viewed that more realistically present the success/failure rate of people who try their hand at different methods of making money on line ? Christ, sorry 'bout that- sort of went off into a tangent there. With any luck you'll be able to make some sort of sense out of what I've been attempting to say ???
It’s one of the oldest and most proven ways to make money – buy low, sell high. The buy low part comes from searching garage sales, estate sales, and even thrift stores to find items that are in good condition (“gently used”) but selling well below what they would if they were brand-new. In this way, you might be able to acquire an item for $5, and later sell it for $50.
Please note that some of the links below are affiliate links and at no additional cost to you, I will earn a commission. Know that I only recommend products, tools and learning resources I've personally used and believe are genuinely helpful, not because of the small commissions I make if you decide to purchase them. Most of all, I would never advocate for buying something that you can't afford or that you're not yet ready to implement.
Offering specific online SEO services is also another online freelancer role that businesses are crying out for. If you know how to improve a website’s SEO by doing keyword research, creating content that can rank in search engines, adding metadata / schema to posts and pages, and building backlinks to a domain, to name a few tasks, then this could be a great line of work for you.
Start by taking other courses you’re interested in: Not only is this important competitor and opportunity analysis, but it also gives you an idea of how a course could or should look and feel. What’s the pacing like? Is it via email, video, in-person chats? Once you understand how you want your course to look, it’s time to decide what it should include. Those same courses are a great starting place. How can you make your course better or more interesting? Do you have experience others don’t?
If you love to travel and find yourself randomly searching for airfare sales or browsing Lonely Planet, why not carve out a niche for yourself as a private travel agent? My friend, Mark Jackson did just that, making extra money online with his travel consulting side business. Start with word of mouth recommendations from friends who know they can count on you for the cheapest flights, and then move on and create a Facebook or LinkedIn group to invite people who want to stay on top of the latest deals. Eventually you could spin this into a full-time consultancy teaching people how to make their dream trip a reality.
I just made my first affiliate commission sale! … So I’m a little over a month into my affiliate empire building. … Right out of the gate I built 5 affiliate niche websites. … It’s been kinda tough getting that site to rank high enough to get Google traffic, but … After that, through talking with Dan, and through the direct access I get with Deadbeat University, I built 4 different sites around things that I like or am interested in.
It may take time to build that audience that turns views into dollars. The average revenue per 1,000 YouTube views is just over $6. But with enough videos for fans to scroll through, those views can add up over time. While you're building an audience, you could also join an affiliate program related to your channel and make money through affiliate links in your video descriptions.
Another strategy to make money online is to become a social marketing manager. Being present on social media is key for any business that wants to attract new customers, promote their products and grow their following. However, constantly posting, liking and commenting on the numerous social media channels is extremely time consuming. More and more businesses are recruiting social media managers to run and organize all their social media. And to save money, social media employees are often employed as online freelancers.
While you play, the app works in the background and transfers small sums from your checking account into a high-yield Blast savings account based on “triggers” you set — things like the number of opponents you defeat or enemy bases you destroy. You can earn extra cash by completing “missions” that allow you to test new games or take familiar games to the next level.
25. Products – You can create your own product, such as an ebook or computer software. You would then use your blog as a promotion tool to get people to buy your product. As long as you create a legitimate product with a whole lot of value, you should be able to get some buyers, but like everything else with a blog, you’ll need the traffic to get the sells.
This is the easiest way to gain experience because you get exposed to other affiliates. You can meet people by joining a discussion forum or an online community. The good thing is that they are free to join and you get very good advice there. Examples of such online communities are ABestWeb, Digital Point, and Warrior Forum. Apart from getting advice from more experienced affiliates, you get the chance to network with other marketers.
The only people I know off, who are making money, but still I have not seen an income statement to that effect and hence I am very cautious, are the people who run very large mailing lists. When you have numbers in the 25,000+ readers in your mailing list, it is very well possible to make affiliate money off them. However, having said this, there are two caveats to the above statement.

Bow Flat Melissa Burgundy Red Women’s Space Pink Ad Love Ii Ballet 51558 0HEqg Gabriele Basilico 13 12 Detail glass plate-bracket attachment: 1. stainless steel cables; 2. hardened layered glass; 3. rollers; 4. steel bracket; 5. anchoring between brackets and pillars 13 View of the interior. The inside and outside are optically continuous and light is the dominant element 078-089 ABDR.indd 87 on one of the short sides, while the other turns toward S.Vitale. The glazed prism, out of the urban scale, a simple linear volume by day, is an “urban lantern” by night, a luminous glow that becomes a motif of urban reconnection on the Via Piacenza side, on which faces the main façade, and an element of urban acceleration in triggering a process of transformation of the part of the city concealed behind Palazzo delle Esposizioni. The intangibility of transparency as restoration and architectural rearrangement defines a structural and technological contemporary quality that establishes dialogue and coexistence with the past, revisited under a new perspective. Transparency, natural light, the dominant feature of the ABDR project, had already been dealt with as theme by Costantino Dardi in his proposal for restructuring the building at the end of the last century (around 1990). It provided, in fact, not only for salvaging the original quality of the interior spaces, altered by the additions made over the years, but also for exalting the vertical view of the building’s three levels through the utilization of light, by means of three great “luminous machines”. But critical restoration of spatial adaptation has been achieved with the ethereal, atmospheric concept of the glazed prism of ABDR, which designed that symbolic presence. The utilization of plates of layered structural glass, hardened and with low emission factor, of large size – on the average, 40mm thick, 1630mm wide and 2400mm long – devoid of frames and supported by a system of metal brackets anchored to horizontal windbracing, it too composed of glass plates of variable size, confers on the great volume a visual perception of lightness and harmonious insinuation into the original form, tangible, opaque and light-colored, of the building, devoid of openings, closed in on itself. The facades are shielded by curtains to satisfy the bioclimatic environmental requisites. 11-12-2007 11:41:36
11. Gabriele Basilico Progetti “Serra ex-Piacentini” Palazzo delle Esposizioni di Roma Projects “Ex-Piacentini” greenhouse of the exhibition hall in Rome 88 14 078-089 ABDR.indd 88 14 View of the upper terrace on the top floor, of the vault and of the monumental wall with pilaster strips of Palazzo delle Esposizioni 15 In the foreground, the surfaces lined with wood that direct the gaze to the upper levels. Above, the horizontal plane in double glass of the ceiling under the low barrel arch of the roof The ceiling in the parallelepiped consists of a horizontal plane of double glass – with thickness of 40mm, width of 1630mm, and length of 2600mm – fixed to a light metal frame with vertical legs and stays that are hooked to the structure of the ceiling. On the outside, this floor has a reflecting surface to provide shielding against sunlight, contributing to the mechanism of tubular brise-soleils above 25 of them, 20mm apart, which rest on the ceiling creating a semi-transparent diaphragm, either shielding against the light or permeable to it depending on the season. The roof of this luminous solid permeable to sight, crowned by the low barrel vault, is an airy volume, open and ventilated, composed of nine purlines with distance between centers of 5,20m, connected by an HEB400 beam, consolidated by cables and struts and covered by bird-proof netting. The interruption between the Piacentini structure and the new glazed one is designed to determine discontinuity between the two masses, the one material, the other intangible, by means of recessing one of the facades, and through a fissure detaching the volumes from the monumental wall of the existing structure. The use of contrasts is one of the salient features of the design composition, which paradoxically reconnects and reconfigures space, establishing a dialogue between the old and the modern. Situated in the lower part are the service volumes faced in travertine panels over a metal substructure fixed to the existing wall; they are visible to the outside on the main façade, and between the two is a public terrace. Between interior and exterior there no longer exists an unbridgeable gap, which is eliminated by transparency and by the system of terraces that are interconnected to the air-conditioned spaces through the glazed perimeter, ensuring spatial continuity between the different areas. The luminous machine has evolved into an ethereal mechanism of remarkable environmental quality, and serving as an urban signal. 11-12-2007 11:41:43

Megawatt Tom Cruise is Roy Miller, a secret agent of the most super kind who Meets Cute with megawatt Cameron Diaz's June Havens a total of three times in about four minutes. First, The Bump Into at an airport, which is directy followed by a second Bump Into, which will be followed by the Heightened Romantic Interlude On Airplane, which also helpfully references Roy and June's dream of forgetting all their troubles and lighting out for Cape Horn which is where the movie will....woah, hold your horses. I'm not just giving it away for free! You gotta buy your ticket like everyone else! Anyway....
In the immediate aftermath of their Romantic Interlude On Airplane June retires to the restroom while Roy offs every single person - pilots included on the plane - so that when June returns from the bathroom she finds Roy landing the plane in a cornfield at which point we begin getting our bearings on that pesky plot. Roy Miller is in possession of a never-ending (literally) battery called the Zephyr (a wonderfully throwback MacGuffin name, if you ask me) which was created by a nerdy scientist played by Paul Dano at mininum wattage named Luscious Jackson (suggesting the makers of "Knight and Day" like to rock out now and again). But the C.I.A., given a face via Peter Saarsgaard and Viola Davis, is after the Zephyr, too, and they are under the impression Roy is trying to steal it rather than protect it. But is he?
This is for June Havens to determine as she and Roy, trailed not only by the C.I.A. but also by a Spanish - I think - arms dealer (Jordi Molla, no wattage whasoever), turbocharge their way from the streets of Boston to a deserted island to an Austrian train to Salzburg to Madrid, alternately trusting him and not trusting him, now again sipping champagne with him in ritzy resorts, every once in awhile finding themselves in a car chase and/or gunfight, while Roy Miller grins and cackles and shoots people and keeps telling her over and over to trust him even as he will do several things that come across as not-trustworthy - such as slipping her into an obligatory bikini at his off-the-grid home while she's sleeping after being (necessarily) drugged.
None of this works, of course, if we don't buy the megawatt stars' characters and I think Roy and June, separately, are believable simply because they are both so aligned with Cruise's and Cameron's personas. Much ado will be made of how Cruise is essentially just riffing on his recent public personality and, to a certain extent, this is true. Is he or isn't he nuts? Are those or aren't those crazy eyes? When he tells June "Everything happens for a reason" he truly, truly believes this is a clear cut explanation. Diaz, meanwhile, is an actress I've always appreciated a great deal when she is playing frenzied and flustered, out of her element, and rarely in "Knight and Day" is she in her element, not even when she's being fitted for a dress for her sister's forthcoming wedding. Generic rom coms ("The Holiday") and serious acting ("Gangs of New York") are not her forté but I think she works quite well here. ("You keep saying my name! Why do you keep saying my name?! It's freaking me out!" This is a line I think I can hear Katie saying at home.) I won't suggest that Cruise and Cameron have the-vineyard-just-caught-on-fire chemistry, because they don't, but they are good enough on their own that you will only feel a minor twinge of disappointment when their eventual kiss coughs and sputters.
The action scenes are, you know, action scenes, they won't change the world, but they'll do and the movie is smart enough to know that in the midst of the action scenes the blah effects aren't the point as much as Roy and June's interaction.
Will "Knight and Day" work as well outside of the frigid cineplex air conditioning? Can it hold up in your living room on a fall evening or on a winter afternoon? Doubtful. So you better go see it now. Preferably when there are heat advisories.
In fairness to Diaz's dramatic acting abilities, she was actually really good in Oliver Stone's under-appreciated Any Given Sunday.

Bansagar Control Board is a subordinate office of the Union Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India. The Board was set up vide Resolution dated the 30th January, 1976. This Resolution was in accordance with the Bansagar Agreement reached between the Governments of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on the 16th September 1973 for sharing the waters of River Sone and the cost of the Bansagar Dam. The main features of the resolution are as below: -
In consultation with the Governments of Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, it has been decided to set up the Bansagar Control Board with a view to ensuring the efficient, economical and early execution of Bansagar dam including all connected works in Madhya Pradesh, but excluding the canal systems which will be executed by respective States namely, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Control Board will be in overall charge of the project including its technical and financial aspects. The actual work of construction will be carried out under the direction of the Control Board by the Chief Engineer concerned of the Madhya Pradesh Government. The three State Governments agree to delegate powers to the Chief Engineer, Madhya Pradesh, to contract for works, supplies and services under the direction of the Control Board. The contract in respect of all works will be executed in the name of the Governor of Madhya Pradesh.
Subject to the general superintendence and control of Board, the management of the affairs of the Board are vested in the Executive Committee. Click here to read the Composition of the Executive Committee.
A handful of domains will have restrictions on them, which means you can only purchase them if you meet certain criteria or have authorization (some examples are .gov, .edu. and .mil). But most extensions are available to everyone. In fact, most country code Top Level Domains (ccTLDs) are available for anyone to purchase, even if you don’t reside in the country in question.
Custom domain name and transfer features: The transfer of a website name is possible, but so is an original name created by a company. The complete process begins with the registrar, and then you’re qualified with a transfer change. The names use FQDN and DNS models to effect your transfer. The year you transfer with a vendor, your domain name and personal data are also collected. Finally, getting your URL lets you customize a website.
Domain names are often simply referred to as domains and domain name registrants are frequently referred to as domain owners, although domain name registration with a registrar does not confer any legal ownership of the domain name, only an exclusive right of use for a particular duration of time. The use of domain names in commerce may subject them to trademark law.
A fictitious domain name is a domain name used in a work of fiction or popular culture to refer to a domain that does not actually exist, often with invalid or unofficial top-level domains such as ".web", a usage exactly analogous to the dummy 555 telephone number prefix used in film and other media. The canonical fictitious domain name is "example.com", specifically set aside by IANA in RFC 2606 for such use, along with the .example TLD.
However, this can be a great way to start your online journey. Especially if the domain you’re purchasing already has a strong backlink profile to give you a boost in the search engines. Once you purchase a domain from Flippa you’ll need to register the domain with a new registrar and choose a host as well. Depending upon the details of the sale and where the current domain is registered and hosted.
Keep in mind that these are the highest value cash only sales that have been reported to us in the past week. This column is meant to be an educational tool, not a complete list documenting ALL high value domain sales. Such a list is impossible to produce because many sales are kept private at the insistence of buyers, sellers or both. Our procedure for verifying the accuracy of domain sales reports is available here.
Providing low cost domains is our mission! Only at Hostinger you will get cheapest domain names with premium service quality. Thanks to our special agreement with TLD owners, we can provide exclusively low prices on the most popular domain names. 99 cent domain names are our privileged feature, cheap domain renewal price is our biggest strength, special domain checker is our tool to your success!
HostGator is a company I used for many years with an old firm, and I've found them to be fairly reliable as a rock-solid grounding for a bandwidth-heavy site. Their control panel is also fairly powerful, allowing you to automatically control your fleet of names, as well as locking them down so that nobody can snipe them if you accidentally let a renewal lapse. Their prices are competitive but not the best, but I've found them to be immensely reliable in the past. Read our HostGator Review.
Don’t get discouraged in your domain name search if what you’re looking for is already taken. We have a couple of ways for dealing with such a situation. You can try our Domain Buy Service, where we negotiate acquiring the domain from its current owner. We also offer a Domain Backorder service, where you purchase a backorder credit to give you a chance to get the domain when it goes into auction.
When you buy a Premium Domain name, you are also buying strong branding potential, high recall, and the ability to attract more traffic to your site. Finding a relevant domain name to your business will provide you a storefront online, allowing your customers the most access to your products as possible. Your domain name is an investment that is easy to map back to success, and the perfect available domain name is just around the corner.
It's good to decide early on if you want to have a brand domain or a keyword domain. The benefit of a brand domain is that your domain will most likely be considered as trustworthy, and immediately shows visitors that it's linked to your business or personal blog. A keyword domain, on the other hand, has the advantage that it will be better optimized for search engines, and therefore will get higher search results. In recent years, however, the drastic improvement in search results thanks to a keyword domain has begun to decrease.
Use our domain checker to catch all of the most popular domains from the huge variety of TLDs: .com, .net, co.uk, .org... Did you know that Hostinger also provides free domain names that are included in most of Hostinger's web hosting packages? Simply order one of our web hosting services with a free domain and enjoy your all-in-one package for an exclusively affordable price. Great deal to start with!
The root is the upper-most part of the DNS hierarchy, and involves delegating administrative responsibility of “top-level domains”, which are the last segment of a domain name, such as .com, .uk and .nz. Part of our tasks includes evaluating requests to change the operators of country code domains, as well as day-to-day maintenance of the details of the existing operators.
A domain name can be used for a variety of purposes. Many people who are not ready for a website simply register the domain name of their choice to ensure it doesn’t get snatched up by anyone else. They may use it to create a professionally branded email address, or as a Web address that can point customers to an alternate online presence, such as their social media page, if they don’t yet have a website.
New domain registrations can be added to a new or existing Netfirms account. Each Netfirms account includes 1 free e-mail account (unless you upgrade to a hosting package). If you are looking to register multiple domains and want an e-mail account for each, you can either create a separate Netfirms account for each domain or upgrade a single Netfirms account to a hosting package.
Choosing the right domain name is essential for a successful online presence. Without a good domain name, you run the risk of being forgotten or lost amongst the masses of websites. If you're setting up a website to complete your social media profile, i.e. a personal website, then this will function differently to a blog or an online shop. It's important to know what the aim of your site is in order to pick the right name. There are two main things to watch out for – general tips, as well as tips for specific kinds of website. You can find these recommendations in the sections below.
Here, we need to understand what a website accomplishes and how it boosts your prospects of an effective business. You get a fully cleared domain name from the registrar. They will issue a “universal resource locator,” which is the link you have directing you to your website. This makes your domain important and uniquely yours. What you get with a network domain is your dedicated spot/business/store on the internet.
Name servers. Most registrars provide two or more name servers as part of the registration service. However, a registrant may specify its own authoritative name servers to host a domain's resource records. The registrar's policies govern the number of servers and the type of server information required. Some providers require a hostname and the corresponding IP address or just the hostname, which must be resolvable either in the new domain, or exist elsewhere. Based on traditional requirements (RFC 1034), typically a minimum of two servers is required.
The hierarchy of domains descends from the right to the left label in the name; each label to the left specifies a subdivision, or subdomain of the domain to the right. For example: the label example specifies a node example.com as a subdomain of the com domain, and www is a label to create www.example.com, a subdomain of example.com. Each label may contain from 1 to 63 octets. The empty label is reserved for the root node and when fully qualified is expressed as the empty label terminated by a dot. The full domain name may not exceed a total length of 253 ASCII characters in its textual representation.[6] Thus, when using a single character per label, the limit is 127 levels: 127 characters plus 126 dots have a total length of 253. In practice, some domain registries may have shorter limits.
There is also what is called a ccTLD, or country code top-level domain. These are designed to signify sites located in or associated with certain countries or territories. Most of the ccTLDs actually don't have restrictions regarding who can register domain names. In fact, many ccTLDs are commonly misinterpreted as TLDs. For example, while .tv is commonly registered by television and media related websites, .tv is actually the ccTLD designated for the country Tuvalu. Domain hacks are also a popular use of both TLDs and ccTLDs. This involves creating a full word or phrase when combining the domain name with the TLD to create something your audience will easily remember. A popular example is using the .me ccTLD for Montenegro and combining it with "aweso" to create the domain aweso.me.
While numbers like the ones seen above are impressive, most domains sell for significantly less extravagant prices and are generally in the two or three-digit range. Not long ago, those who were able to secure general terms (like icecream.com or pizza.com) not protected by trademark rights often found themselves sitting on virtual gold mines. The glory days of this boom have long since passed, and those looking for a profit in today’s market need a keen sense for coming trends.
Under no circumstances should you pay more to transfer a name than to get a new one. Check what the transfer will require. Does the new service handle the task completely? Or do you have to go into your current registrar's site and change the technical details manually? Finally, check the transfer policy of the registrar before registering your domain name.
If you do not have a web host, you can always allow the registrar to park your domain name at a temporary website specially set up for you. This way you can quickly secure your domain name before it's too late and still take your time to set up the other aspects of your site. As far as I can tell, most registrars (or probably all) automatically park your domain by default whether you ask them to or not, so if this is your situation, you probably don't have to do anything special to get it done. Some of those registrars also provide you with a free email address at your own domain name while it is parked at their site, like sales@example.com (where "example.com" is your domain).
The market-driven principles of the domain trade mean that a domain is only worth as much as the buyer is willing to pay. It is for this reason that criteria such as market potential and usability play such central roles in determining prices. Values can change at the drop of a hat. The price of a domain that was once of little interest to anyone in years past can skyrocket once, for example, a newly founded company takes interest in that same name.
Note that you can also transfer your domain name from one registration service to another. You'll want to do this if you're not satisfied with your current domain hosting service, if you find a better deal when your current registration is coming due, or, most likely, if you've signed up with a web hosting service that will also transfer your name to its site. Expect to get the transfer for free, but if that isn't offered, search for another domain hosting service.
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will be enforced by the European Union (EU) on May 25th, 2018. The GDPR is a strict set of rules centered around customer privacy.

SnapNames is a web domain name marketplace - meaning that they only deal specifically with domains that are currently owned by somebody else. They offer daily and premium auctions, private brokerage of domains, and buy-it-now listings for buying and selling domain names, including over 30 million domain names that aren't all, as you'll find on some services, exorbitant. They have over three million customers, including a significant number of small businesses, which is worth it.

Yes, my friends, it's that time of year once again. The 18th annual ImageOut Film Festival has arrived! You can now all expect Matt and I to bombard you with programs and pester you to join us for a movie or two. We're both really excited for this year's festival, and after all our hard work helping to put it all together, we'd love it if you'd come out and show your support for the festival. The festival will run from October 8th - October 17th.
The last date for in-person ticket sales is this Thursday, September 30th, from 6 - 8pm at the Imageout office in Village Gate. You can also order tickets through the ImageOut website anytime through Thursday, October 7th at 5:00pm.
To help make your decision about what to see a little easier, here's our handy guide to which films we'll be seeing, with a brief, semi-helpful, totally cracked-out description along with a link to the film's trailer. You can find more detailed descriptions if you click the film's title, or if you already have a festival program guide.
Leave a comment or message either Matt or myself if you can't make it to Thursday's ticket sale and want us to pick up a ticket for you.
A group of four friends has their little circle rocked when one of the girls falls for the other girl, leaving the boys to wonder "WTF girls?!" All four lead actors will be in attendance!
James "Sexy" Franco plays famous poet Al "Capone" Ginsberg in a cool period film with jazz, abstract animation, and Jon "Mad Man" Hamm.
::UPDATE:: HOWL is now sold out, but rush tickets may become available if you'd like to try your luck and don't mind waiting in line before the screening.
Haven't seen this one, but as far as we know, this is about a fisherman who falls for another dude in Peru. City Newspaper film critic Dayna Papaleo said it has a ghost in it?!
Comedy about a "fruit fly" looking for love, outside of her circle of gay friends. It's gonna be a little raunchy. The film's director & writer will be in attendance!
This will be our first time attending the annual program of locally-produced short films. Come out and support local filmmakers!
A beautifully shot Argentinian drama about a little girl's friendship with a young boy named Mario. It's a tough sell, but it really is one of the best film's we're showing this year.
The title really says it all. A wickedly funny, Grindhouse-style, "transploitation" film. It's gonna be bloody and it's gonna be AWESOME. AND! The director's gonna be there!!
30th(ish) Anniversary presentation of the classic documentary examining the lives of gay and lesbian individuals.
The "out-there" shorts program. Last year, outraged audiences flooded the festival blog with comments calling for the programming committee's heads. So be warned: it's gonna be graphic, it's gonna be tense, and there's explicit pornographic gay sex. Matt: "SOLD!" There's also a short film directed by James Franco included!
A documentary examining Native American culture / beliefs as it relates to transgendered people (they were originally revered as being of "two spirits"), and how it ties in to the horrible murder of a Native American transgendered kid in Arizona a few years ago. Another film we haven't seen, but it looks really good.
A cute Southern mother wants her son to find a man and attempts to help out. It's cute and fluffy and funny. Like a bunny. The film's writer/director will be in attendance!
A documentary about the obsession with "buff" guys in the gay culture. In other words, it's a documentary, with a lot of buff guys.
Adam's favorite film in the festival this year, this drama examines a young teen's turbulent relationship with his mother. If you've ever been a teenager and argued with your parents, you'll be able to relate to this film. The film's 20-year-old director is also it's writer and lead actor, and it went on to win 3 awards at the Cannes film festival!
Cute, fluffy gay comedy about mistaken identity involving a writer-guy, his go-go-boy roommate, and a musician-cowboy. COWBOY HAT!! One of the film's lead actors will be in attendance!
Closing Night! A costume drama set in 19th century England about a woman, her lover, and their awesome clothes. By the BBC! Fancy! There are several ticket buying options for Closing Night: film only, Closing Night Party only, and both together. Check the site for prices.
Dramedy about a somewhat girly straight guy and the secret his longtime girlfriend has been keeping from him.
The fall television season is upon us (holy crap where did the summer go??) and it's time to start setting the DVR for all the new and returning shows that I'm excited to watch this year. Matt posted recently about our overall disappointment with last year's television season, so we both really want this season's shows to bring it.
Like V, I'd like to watch the first couple episodes to see if it's worth viewing week after week, and then make a decision. V wasn't, BTW.
I really liked but didn't love the first season. I'm really hoping season two fixes at least some of the problems I had with one.
I don't have DirecTV, so I'll hopefully be obtaining the episodes by... other means, and then re-watching them when they air on NBC. Yes, I love this show that much.
After a lackluster season of Top Chef, I want this new spin-off to be a lot of fun. How can it not with everyone's favorite judge, Gail Simmons, taking over hosting duties?
People complained that last season was a letdown, but I still found 30 Rock to be one of the most consistently funny sitcoms currently on TV.
Again, others (namely my housemates) found last season lacking, but I remained a fan. Plus, with the recent announcement that this will be Steve Carrell's last season with the show, you HAVE to watch.
I'm a little worried that this show won't be able to live up to my stratospheric expectations. But c'mon. Zombies? Frank Darabont? It's going to kick ass.
There's also a bunch of returning TV shows that I'd like to watch but haven't seen the previous season(s) of. Sadly, I doubt I'll have a chance to get caught up in time.
And then there's the shows that have been on for several years, and I haven't watched at ALL, but still really want to:
A reusable Starbucks cup filled with Iced Pumpkin Spice Latte. Well shit, at least I'll be highly caffeinated.
The Last Exorcism, the latest in the "Satan-GTFO-of-my-teenage-daughter" genre of films was released today, and while I was less than impressed by the trailers I've seen, reviews have been surprisingly decent. Being one of the last remaining people in America who still pays any attention to a film's critical reception, I'm finding myself swayed into actually kinda-sorta wanting to see it. Alas, it will most likely join the ranks of the other big(ish) summer movies that I wanted to see, but none of my friends had the slightest interest in, like Piranha 3-D, The Other Guys, Dinner For Schmucks, Despicable Me, and Predators.
One aspect of the film that I'm already a fan of, however, is the viral ad campaign using Chatroulette. Having not used the randomized sex chat service myself, I can only go by what I've heard and/or read about the site, which is that it's frequented mostly by horny teenage boys out to catch a glimpse of some boobs but usually only finding a lot of exposed wangs. These ingenious ads for the film take full advantage of the lust-addled minds of the site's users, using as bait an attractive young girl, who by all appearances seems to be looking for a naughty good time. The girl smiles and flirts, but never speaks. She begins to unbutton her shirt, giggling all the while, and just when her admirers are completely hooked, her eyes roll back in her head. And that's just the beginning.
I sort of feel bad for the ad's victims --a couple seem like they're going to be scarred for life-- but I can't deny the range of reactions are pretty damn funny. Kudos to the film's marketing department, though; they've come up with a creative, memorable campaign that definitely has people talking. And hopefully, actually going to see the movie.
I'm not sure what it is about this song, never having been effected by suicide myself, but it gets me every time I hear it. It never fails to leave me feeling sad and contemplative, yet I can't stop listening to it. I suppose that's just a testament to how good it is.
In honor of tonight's season finale of Rupaul's Drag Race (aka the gayest and most fabulous reality show competition to ever grace America's television sets) I give you a compilation of the greatest moments from the season thus far, courtesy my favorite Drag Race video bloggers, Jon & John.

Since its founding, the company has attracted criticism and controversy from multiple sources over its actions. These include: supplying law enforcement with facial recognition surveillance tools;[154] forming cloud computing partnerships with the CIA;[155] luring customers away from the site's brick and mortar competitors;[156] placing a low priority on warehouse conditions for workers; participating in anti-unionization efforts; remotely deleting content purchased by Amazon Kindle users; taking public subsidies; claiming that its 1-Click technology can be patented; engaging in anti-competitive actions and price discrimination;[157] and reclassifying LGBT books as adult content.[158][159] Criticism has also concerned various decisions over whether to censor or publish content such as the WikiLeaks website, works containing libel and material facilitating dogfight, cockfight, or pedophile activities. In December 2011, Amazon faced a backlash from small businesses for running a one-day deal to promote its new Price Check app. Shoppers who used the app to check prices in a brick-and-mortar store were offered a 5% discount to purchase the same item from Amazon.[160] Companies like Groupon, eBay and Taap.it countered Amazon's promotion by offering $10 off from their products.[161][162] The company has also faced accusations of putting undue pressure on suppliers to maintain and extend its profitability. One effort to squeeze the most vulnerable book publishers was known within the company as the Gazelle Project, after Bezos suggested, according to Brad Stone, "that Amazon should approach these small publishers the way a cheetah would pursue a sickly gazelle."[122] In July 2014, the Federal Trade Commission launched a lawsuit against the company alleging it was promoting in-app purchases to children, which were being transacted without parental consent.[163]

In late 2016, the company launched its first experimental Go store, which replaces cashiers with a computer vision system that automatically detects when you take products off the shelf and checks you out as you leave the store. Go now has two locations in Chicago, three in Seattle, and one that just opened in San Francisco today, with more planned in California and New York City over the course of the next year. Bloomberg reported in September that Amazon may open as many as 3,000 Go locations by 2021, with the goal of competing with stores like CVS and 7-Eleven, as well as fast casual and made-to-go meal establishments. The company is also now experimenting with brick-and-mortar stores that sell only four-star rated products from Amazon.com, starting with a location in New York City.
When it comes to last-mile delivery, Amazon has publicly disclosed its work on drones and the Prime Air program to use those unmanned aerial vehicles to drop packages on our doorstep. The project has been in the works since 2013, and it’s hit a few snags as the regulation of US commercial drone operations has been a slow and often painful process for companies trying to get operations off the ground.

Amazon has attracted widespread criticism for poor working conditions by both current employees, who refer to themselves as Amazonians,[178] and former employees,[179][180] as well as the media and politicians. In 2011, it was publicized that at the Breinigsville, Pennsylvania warehouse, workers had to carry out work in 100 °F (38 °C) heat, resulting in employees becoming extremely uncomfortable and suffering from dehydration and collapse. Loading-bay doors were not opened to allow in fresh air, due to the company's concerns over theft.[181] Amazon's initial response was to pay for an ambulance to sit outside on call to cart away overheated employees.[181] The company eventually installed air conditioning at the warehouse.[182]

Tools like Honey hang out quietly while you shop, combing the web for the lowest price on whatever you’re buying. “One tool that saves Honey members time and money is Droplist,” says Honey’s Parisi. “Droplist watches selected items, notifying shoppers when the price of an item drops below the amount initially chosen. Droplist monitors the price of the item for 30, 60, or 90 days and will automatically send an email when the price drops to the amount that was set.”
After reading a report about the future of the Internet that projected annual web commerce growth at 2,300%, Bezos created a list of 20 products that could be marketed online. He narrowed the list to what he felt were the five most promising products, which included: compact discs, computer hardware, computer software, videos, and books. Bezos finally decided that his new business would sell books online, due to the large worldwide demand for literature, the low price points for books, along with the huge number of titles available in print.[27] Amazon was founded in the garage of Bezos' rented home in Bellevue, Washington.[25][28][29] Bezos' parents invested almost $250,000 in the start-up.[30]

In June 2017, Amazon announced that it would acquire Whole Foods, a high-end supermarket chain with over 400 stores, for $13.4 billion.[14][41] The acquisition was seen by media experts as a move to strengthen its physical holdings and challenge Walmart's supremacy as a brick and mortar retailer. This sentiment was heightened by the fact that the announcement coincided with Walmart's purchase of men's apparel company Bonobos.[42] On August 23, 2017, Whole Foods shareholders, as well as the Federal Trade Commission, approved the deal.[43][44]

He figured out that he could build brand recognition by blanketing the airwaves with cheap direct-to-consumer commercials, and then take the product into retail stores where he slapped an "As Seen On TV" logo on them, which he designed himself. It’s a very lucrative formula, he told me, so that’s what he’s been doing ever since.
AWS started way back in 2000 as a way to help other retailers manage e-commerce operations, but it soon expanded into much more when key project members managed to convince Bezos that improving and evolving Amazon’s own infrastructure may hold the key to a new business model. In 2006, the product as we know it today launched into public availability and proved to be a pioneer for the entire cloud computing industry, offering cloud storage, hosting, and a suite of other tools for managing entire digital infrastructures in remote data centers. The division now pulls in roughly $6 billion every quarter and continues to grow at breakneck pace. It earned $17.5 billion in revenue in all of 2017 and regularly outperforms the company’s entire North American retail division in terms of profit.

Few architects have embraced new media platforms as well and as much as 2016 Presidential Honoree Annie Chu. (Need to confirm that for yourself? Check her twitter and insta both under the @chugooding name.) So, when we opened her answers to her 2016 AIA|LA Presidential Honoree Q&A, we thought we already knew how well she communicated. Wrong, wrong, wrong. Take these plumb quotes for instance: “LA is change.” Or “…everything can be dreamed better.”
We’d say we were giving her responses away, but we’re just beginning to let you in on the Educator of the Year’s eloquence. So, read on to discover her own favorite Instagram feeds and what project she considers her love letter to the city.
AIA|LA: Dream commission. What current site in Los Angeles would you reconceive to serve our future, and how or why?
Annie Chu, FAIA: The intersection of Figueroa and Pico is a (and is at a) critical juncture in LA. It is the crossroads of downtown’s urban core with the low-rise frontier of suburban density that lies beyond. Multiple voting districts representing diverse populations converge on the spot. And, it is a zone of rapid transition; as downtown’s development pushes outward, the southland is experiencing increasing commercialization and privatization.
The site, however, is so much more dynamic, and really demands more than an overhaul by economic forces. It has all of the ingredients to prompt a revolution in building typologies, to be the grounds for fleshing out a uniquely LA density. My partners Rick Gooding, Michael Matteucci and I, together with our team would love to play a part in rethinking the Figueroa / Pico intersection as a public square and catalyst to a civic gateway to downtown.
AC: LA’s embrace of change is the only thing about the city that should never be changed. LA is change. The city’s history is one of pushing limits, setting precedents, going big. For LA to be true to its originating motivations, it cannot fear upturning itself. There is nothing too precious to be challenged or reconceived; everything can be dreamed better.
AC: The work that my firm (Chu+Gooding Architects) did (with Populous, HMC Architects, and Olin) for the LA Convention Center design competition was a love letter to the city. It was the re-gifting of a huge complex at the center of the city to the people and spirit of Los Angeles.
The proposal, in concept and form, drew referentially on the artifacts and histories of LA’s design legacy. It embraced both the sun and smog of the local environment, encouraging a fluidity between interiors and exteriors and playing with both polish and grit. It tried to reconcile monumentality with intimacy. And, it made spaces for making, calling for the inclusion of local creative talent in both the outfitting and programming of the facility. We hope these ideas are contagious.
AIA|LA: What book, website, blog or Instagram feed about Los Angeles should we all be reading or following?
AC: As with everything in LA, it’s so hard to pick just one. We follow the happenings at Arcana, Hennessey & Ingalls, The Last Bookstore, LA Review of Books, Libros Schmibros, Skylight Books, …
We loved the recent texts, Sidewalking: Coming to Terms with Los Angeles, by David Ulin and Waiting for Lipchitz at Chateau Marmont: A Novel, by Aris Janigian. Everyone, of course, should be checking in on Jonathan Gold’s “101 Best Restaurants.”
AC: I frequently find myself sitting with friends and family in the back booth at Winsome, at the base of the William Pereira designed tower (formerly Department of Water and Power, now the Elysian Apartments) in Echo Park. I am biased about Winsome, but for me with my back against the wall papered in Echo Park Lake like images, looking out at seated diners in the sunken patio and people walking on the elevated sidewalk always evoke a warm and fuzzy.

I didn't realize what this fabric and pattern would do to me. Seriously, readers I've been swooned! If that's even a word! It's been a while since vie felt a thrill like this and then my color phobia began to set in and panic ensued. Wadder or just toss it in the circular filing? But alas I found my common sense on the floor, picked it up and finished this hidden gem maybe even a diamond.
Brights and artsy florals are on trend this summer. At first I went right past this print to another boring, yet beautiful neutral fabric. But something in my peripheral caught my eye. It was a bit ugly and beautiful, to me, at the same time. Often when I'm on the hunt I snap a quick pick for reference if I'm buyin' or just to help me make up my mind, hot or not? Fabric Used: jacquard fuchsia scribble flower print, a spring bottom weight from JoAnn's, 100% Cotton. I had to use blue tailors chalk for the markings to see darts & seam lines. 1/8 cording used. Invisable zipper
Let's talk about the pattern. Butterick, I hope you're listening. I knew you could do it. Incorporate design, simplicity and style all in one pattern, that's easy enough for beginners to complete successfully and for the more experienced, an easy breezy, "I need a dress to whip up I a couple days" and look fabulous, type pattern. Pattern Description: MISSES' DRESS: Semi-fitted, straight dresses A, B, mid-knee length, have lined bodice, pleated front neckline, midriff front, side slant pockets, back zipper and hemline vent. A: self-fabric piping trim.
I know, I know I need to take more pics as I go along, but readers I got really wrapped up! Here are the detailed pics.
Lining: switched the order around a bit so I didn't have to hand stitch. Don't get be wrong, I love couture, but much more so when the techniques are appreciated. My exception: Hems! My mother taught me that. Hand stitched hems are the best!! IMO.
Back to the lining. Leave the side seams open, sew lining neckline, then armsye, pull through and press. The finish side seams. I found that under stitching was not necessary. Everything laid perfectly, especially where piped.
The piping: I choose to use the same fabric to do the piping. It's very simple to do. I usually secure the trim by sewing across the fabric through the cord to prevent slipping. The trim was placed so that the colors did dot match up. So the pink is next to the white or the purple is against the yellow. I really wanted a contrast so the colors would pop!!! That turned out well!
Pocket retrospective: Please consider your waist proportions. Next time, if there is a next time, I will narrow the upper edge of the front skirt to show more pocket. The whole rule of thirds is missed at my waistline, IMO. Probably not that obvi to some, but because I really like the rest of the dress it will stay this way.
Would I sew it again? I probably won't sew his one again, but I really recommend it. Thinking of transferring some design elements to another pattern though. I would have liked to play with the neckline, but the design was satisfying. One suggestion: keep the fabric patterned or highly textured. When initially picking this pattern, I was not enthused with the center front bust seam. It does not flow with the nice curved lined of the bodice midriff. Or do a test muslin with the front bust on the fold. I think that will work.
Gorgeous dress and gorgeous fabric. This is the dress I am making next, and I am very excited to finish it. I was concerned the neckline might be an awkward height, but it looks good on u :)
The community of Colonial Village occupies the northernmost point of the District of Columbia. It is bound by 16th Street, Holly Street and Bach Drive. Settlement of this area began in the 1600s. Modern day Colonial Village was originally included on some of the first maps of Virginia. This changed in 1629 when King Charles I of England granted the land rights to the first Lord of Baltimore. Subsequently, the land was absorbed into the colony of Maryland. It wasn’t until 1800 that Colonial Village was included in the northwest quadrant of D.C.
While the community’s name is tied to America’s colonial past, the only colonial homes to be found here are replicas. The first house in Colonial Village was completed in 1931.
Despite its size, Colonial Village is a dynamic, tight-knit community. Winding hills and thickets of mature trees slope into Rock Creek Park, the perfect place to run, jog, bike or walk the dog. Colonial Village offers a quiet, residential experience.
The closest metro to Colonial Village is Silver Spring station on the Red line, which is accessible to Colonial Village residents by car or bike.

I originally shared this recipe on the blog a couple of years ago after adapting it from here, and let me tell you this dish has become a fall classic that we all look forward to year after year. It's in that dangerous category of desserts that aren't too sweet so you can actually keep eating it (and eating and eating and eating) until it's all gone! (which is exactly what I did last week - oops!)
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, whisk together the cream, milk, pumpkin, sugar and salt, eggs, and spices. In a separate bowl, melt the butter, and toss the bread cubes in to coat them, then add the bread to the larger bowl with pumpkin spice mix, making sure all pieces are coated evenly. Place the bread mix in an ungreased casserole dish and bake until the custard is set, about 25-35 minutes. Seriously one of my favorite desserts of all time.
Yum! I love pumpkin bread pudding. Try making it next time with challah bread and topping it with whipped cream- heavely!
I've never had bread pudding, but it's one of my dad's favorites. So, I just may try this, it looks good and I do like pumpkin. A few days ago I posted a list of fall desserts that I want to try before the season is over, so I'll be adding yours to my list!

The healthy church has several venues or opportunities each week or month to develop a well-rounded teaching ministry:
The pastor’s pulpit ministry. People should leave worship knowing a bit more about the text on which the sermon was based, including larger and smaller contextual issues. Far too often, people hear what they think is a great sermon, but they learned nothing about the inspired text. Essentially, many preachers give a “TED Talk, with a scripture attached to it, as someone once said. The focus of the sermon, however, is not the exegesis of the text. Rather, sermons should focus on the application of the well-examined text. The sermon affords five to ten minutes of actual Bible teaching ministry.
Sunday School ministry. Sunday School is traditionally designed to survey the Bible’s content, so that children will grow up to know most of the Bible stories, and adults grapple with the setting and background of the 66 books, along with the larger flow of argument or narrative in them. The emphasis is on what the Bible says. Historically, Sunday School curricula is formulated on a seven-year cycle, so that the devoted Sunday School student will have surveyed the entire Bible.
Midweek ministry. Midweek ministry should include an element of training in Christian ministry. Many churches still refer to the midweek meeting as Prayer Meeting, although the role of prayer in the midweek meeting has been significantly reduced in most churches to allow more time for Bible study. The way most midweek Bible studies are conducted is essentially the same as the Sunday School ministry, except that there is no Sunday School book, and the pastor just simply opens the Bible and divulges what he knows about a given passage. A well-rounded Bible teaching ministry, however, should give ample instruction on how to read the Bible, rather than repeating the Sunday School’s mission of merely teaching what the Bible says. The idea is that the midweek faithful hone Bible study skills that increase their competence to teach the Bible. Thus, midweek ministry is more than just Bible teaching, but also training in Bible teaching.

The words were scarcely out of his mouth when, much to his dismay, Death stood before him and professed his readiness to serve him.
He was almost frightened out of his wits, but he had enough presence of mind to stammer out, "Good sir, if you'd be so kind, pray help me up with my burden again."

Why are some flowers called weeds, while others are desirable plants? A plant's behavior is as important as its appearance when it comes to answering this question. Plants that grow and reproduce too rapidly are becoming a serious problem. The following list contains plants that are invasive in Pennsylvania.
Invasive plants are typically non-native plants that reproduce rapidly. They often choke out or eliminate other plants. Often they will grow in many different ecological niches, especially in disturbed sites. Most invasive plants are poor food and habitat sources for wildlife.
Sometimes a plant will show its invasive nature by spreading over, under, through, and into every possible space it can find. In these cases it is easy to identify it as an invasive plant. In other cases a plant may be more subtle. Burning bushes, privets, and amur honeysuckles look completely harmless in the landscape, yet if you check in nearby fields or forests you’ll find countless seedlings. Getting a professional opinion or checking a government list of invasive plants (available through the DCNR) is the best method to determine if a plant is invasive or not.
If you have any questions about invasive plants just ask us the next time you're at the nursery. Our goal is to provide ecologically safe and responsible plants for our customers.

Mutianyu Great Wall is located in Huairou County about 45 miles from Beijing, Mutianyu Great Wall enjoys a long history and is part of the glorious culture of China. It connects Juyongguan Pass in the west and Gubeikou Great Wall in the east. The wall was first built in Northern Qi Dynasty (550 - 557).
In Ming Dynasty (1368 - 1644), Tan Lun and Qi Jiguang, two famous patriotic generals, rebuilt it in order to strengthen its defensive potential when they guarded the strategic pass. It served as the northern protective screen, guarding the capital and imperial mausoleums for generations.
Mutianyu Great Wall winds 1.4 miles through lofty mountains and high ridges, many sections of which are made of granite. The unique structure makes the wall almost indestructible. It measures 23 to 26 feet high and four to five yards wide. Both of the wall's inner and outer sides have parapets to defend against enemies coming from the two sides. Some parapets are saw- tooth shaped instead of the regular rectangular form. Below the parapets, there are square embrasures the top of which are designed in an arc structure, different from the traditional round embrasures.
There are 22 watch towers distributed at close intervals along the wall. They are located not only in the main wall but also at the distinctive 'branch cities'. Branch cities are built on the hill ridge against the inner or outer side of the wall. They measure from several yards to dozens of yards across. On the northwest over 3,281-feet hills, lies a section of the wall called 'Ox Horn Edge'. On the steep and lofty peaks, there are two walls named 'Flying Eagle Flies Facing Upward' and 'Arrow Lock'. What is more rarely seen on the southeast side is a general gateway platform guarded by three watch towers together. In locations of strategic importance, batteries are set up to reinforce the defense capabilities. Mutianyu Great Wall really deserves to be the archetype of the ten thousand li Great Wall.
Besides its strategically important location and compact layout, the Mutianyu Great Wall is also famous for the breath-takingly beautiful scenery. Woods cover over ninety-six percent of the total scenic area. The wall presents different aspects of beauty in the four seasons. Flowers bloom all over the mountains in spring. Grasses dress the hillside green in summer.
Trees are laden with sweet fruits in autumn, and especially in October, leaves are turning red or yellow, touching the mountain tops with gold. In winter, the wall is covered by snow, making it seem more magnificent. The pine trees around Mutianyu Great Wall are well-known. There are more than 20 pines over 300 years old and about 200 pines over 100 year old. Besides, spring water at the foot of the wall tastes pure and fragrant, much appreciated by visitors.
What's more, the national first-rate cable car is installed in Mutianyu Great Wall. A sled named 'Speed' will give you an opportunity to experience thrills by taking you swoop down from the high mountains. China Stone City collects weird and beautiful stones, attracting more and more visitors to come and see.

Norahs time in preschool was short but she really liked it. She does not understand it is out for the summer, we will miss it. Norah will be turning five soon but next year we are going to send her back to this school because it is the closest thing to an oral- signing deaf school in Arkansas. What I mean by that is at the school they will sign with Norah in SEE2 the same way we do at home and talk to her at the same time, like her hearing peers. With Norah their hands and voices are always on so she is getting visual cues to go with the words she is hearing. She is the only one in the class that uses sign, the rest of the kids are working on becoming oral only but they were Implanted at age two or younger so they not only get the benefit of early intervention but they have been hearing for over two years now. The next year will be a very important one for Norah because Lori and I decided when we first got Norah and did research on late implanted CI kids that we would try to do our best to not get discouraged with Norah’s progress until she has been fully bilaterally implanted for one year. If at that time we see Norah making progress towards understanding speech we would keep moving towards a more hearing form of communication setting. If she looks like she is still stuck not understanding speech at all after one year of being bilaterally implanted then we will reassess how far she has come and the speed of her progress at that time. She has just started labeling things with speech to her best ability. My hope right now is that Norah is soaking up every thing right now like a sponge and sorting it out in her head, and when her mouth catches up with her brain we will see she was understanding a lot more then she let on. She is already showing signs that that is happening. I just won’t know the extent of it for awhile. It will take about a month to get her into a good map with her new ear, she will then have the hearing capability to become oral. We just need to see if her brain can store, process and spit back out the information it is finally receiving.

Maryland Eastern Shore's Bobby Collins accepts the 2015 Ben Jobe award at the CollegeInsider.com Awards Banquet on April 3 in Indianapolis.
INDIANAPOLIS, IN -- Maryland Eastern Shore's Bobby Collins is the recipient of the 2015 Ben Jobe award.
Coach Jobe is an icon in the history of basketball at Historically Black Colleges and Universities. He is best known as the head coach of the Southern University, a position he held for 12 seasons. He has also head coach at Alabama A&M, Alabama State, Talladega, Tuskegee and South Carolina State.
His record at Southern was 209-141 and included four NCAA Tournament appearances. He also coached the Jaguars to one NIT appearance, five SIAC championships, 11 SWAC titles and two NAIA Tournament Championships. Perhaps his most memorable moment as a coach was Southern's 93-78 win over Georgia Tech in the first round of the 1993 NCAA Tournament. It stands as one of the great upsets in the history of the event.
My wife sent me this article. Kayaker Raising Awareness Of Fragile Marine Sanctuary – Yahoo! News. This is a guy that is getting out there and doing something. I’d love to go with him and film him for a Wired Kayaker podcast. I wonder if I could get in touch with him to help build buzz about his cause. He’s pretty determined at 77 to make a difference and I commend that. I must learn more.

MovingBack's post is an example of what Prichard was trying to say which I agree with - mold can be a serious problem DEPENDING ON THE PERSON -if you have allergies &/or sinus problems then of course it would probably be a problem! But for someone without these health concerns, you would just smell mold & clean it! The humidity in our house gets to 70% at times so who knows if there's mold - but we don't see it & don't smell it, so it must not be a problem even if it's there!
mold can be a serious problem DEPENDING ON THE PERSON -if you have allergies &/or sinus problems then of course it would probably be a problem! But for someone without these health concerns, you would just smell mold & clean it!
Well, according to the previous post, if it's in EVERY house in Florida, it's microscopic and you can't see it or smell it, then everyone in Florida must impervious to mold or we would all be dead by now.
I'm just trying to get a handle on this objectively. We all know mold is not static. It is a living, growing organism. If it seeps through the foundation and gets into the walls of every home in Florida, wouldn't it stand to reason that after a few years every older home would be uninhabitable? I know when my previous home was built. It was a concrete block home on a concrete foundation. I saw the inside of these walls myself after the home was 24 years old. Surely mold would have been visible if it had been growing for 24 years?
Perhaps there is someone on this board who can help us. Maybe today I will call my building inspector friend....this is a real conundrum.
My house was built in 1969, cinder block home, no mold, just on the patio and front porch where the water sits from rain.
Tallrick you suggested not to use sheetrock in your homes, so what materials do you use? What type of homes do you build? We are relocating this spring/summer and are probably going to build.
pianogal your friend the inspector how do you go about getting one? If we build do you recommend hiring one while home is being built? If we manage to find a home already build I quess it would be wise to get inspected BEFORE we buy huh? Thanks...Do they charge much to inspect? Thanks guys
I have lived in Florida for 40 yrs never had mold problem. If a home is not built right and water gets in mold will develop. anywhere in USA this will happen. I know of one such builder who didnot coat the outside of home and water was coming in during storms. But that is rare.
Absolutely, get an inspector. We used a personal friend who is a builder - but was not building our home. If you buy a resale home - you still need a home inspector. If you were in Orlando, I would give you the name of the guy that inspected our old home before we sold it. He was extremely thorough. This is a HUGE investment so be sure you get these bases covered. I couldn't tell you the charge because our friend didn't charge us. I think the inspector's charge for the resale home was $500.00. That included the original inspection and then a followup after the recommended work had been done.
I spoke with two contractor/builders today and one friend who is an architectural engineer and builds hospitals all over the southeast (he is currently building one in Alabama and was home for the weekend.)
They all happened to be together having coffee in the fellowship hall at church this morning. Perfect timing, I thought so I approached them asked them the question about all homes in Florida having mold. Their concerted reply was absolutely not. If a home has mold on the walls or between the floors it's because the home was not properly built and/or sealed. They added that it's a common problem with newer homes in Florida because builders are throwing them up so fast - they often don't take the time to do the work properly.
This is why I never use wood or drywall in any of my construction. There's no mold here, anywhere . Mildew can form in the bathtub but that's easily cleaned away. Mold was less of a problem when homes were not to tight and drywall did not exist. It always amazed me how people build wood houses and then stucco them. Those cheap ugly Mc Mansions are always breeding grounds for toxic mold.
Tallrick...do you then build your home out of concrete block? I think that is the issue being discussed not wood. The claim is that water seeps through the concrete foundation therefore all homes in Florida have mold. I haven't seen any wooden homes stuccoed here - all the homes I've seen are poured concrete or concrete block.
Thanks for the tip pianogal...I will definately have my home inspected during and after construction if we build and if not I sure will have it done before I buy an existing home!!!
I use all concrete, floors, roof and block for interior partitions. The inner portions of outside walls are styrofoam with expanded mesh and stucco. During Wilma I had a window break due to a tree falling on the house and took on an inch or more of water on the floor as it blew against the bedroom window and even with the door closed water flowed freely throughout the house. As I have no insurance it was up to me to clean up. The concrete walls, terazzo floor and steel furniture was not harmed, and there was no visible damage anywhere due to the storm. Last year I got a friend in the business to inspect for mold, and no spores were detected anywhere. On the other hand I knew of someone in Saga Bay ( I call it soggy bay) where the home was destroyed in hurricane Andrew, rebuilt and eventually developed a leak in the roof right over an interior wall. After the damage was discovered and the roof was repaired the wall was ripped out to replace damaged drywall. The entire wall was filled with black, powdery mold so toxic that one worker needed to be hospitalized. I have seen mold so often you wouldn't believe it. Most kitchens and bathrooms leak, and therefore have mold. In every central air conditioner you can find mold growing in the drainage tray. Mold needs an organic surface to grow on, so you never see it thrive on concrete, it can grow there if it's moist as it attracts dirt, but once dry the mold dies. You never see mold grow on bare concrete but I have seen it grow on painted concrete as latex paints contain organic matter. Metals are mold proof as well as glass, porcelain, etc. Pressure treated lumber is also mold-resistant so it's the only wood that should be in contact with concrete. Also be aware that oil-based paints should NEVER be used on concrete surfaces, humidity tends to bubble it off. One of the most common places to find mold is under carpeting, humidity from the concrete floor comes up to feed the growth. Avoid organic material and you will never, ever have to worry about mold!

Silvera Grant holds up a diagram of the Altadena Community Garden revitalization project at the March meeting of the Altadena Chamber of Commerce.
According to Silvera Grant, director of the garden at the corner of Lincoln Avenue and Palm Street, the shrubs in the area outside of the garden fence were getting old, and full of litter and invasive plants. Garden members, along with students from Cal Poly Pomona, drew up a Corner Revitalization Project for garden.
So far, the Los Angeles County Department of Parks and Recreation "has already cleared, mulched and installed a new state of the art solar timer irrigation system" in the landscaped area outside of the garden's fence.
"They will also provide long term maintenance of the area once the project is completed. The only parts missing now are the plants and planting supplies to cover the 3,800 square feet, estimated to cost $14,000," Grand said in a press release. To raise that money, the garden has mounted a capital campaign, thru direct mail requests and presentations to community groups.
The landscape outside the fence will be divided into three formal planting areas: California native plants, cactus and succulents, and drought-tolerant Mediterranean plants. "They will serve as educational tools for the community, providing landscaping ideas for those wishing to create water-conserving landscapes at home. In addition, the plants will be a draw for beneficial insects and pollinators, aiding the vegetable growers inside the ACG," Grant said in the release.
Altadena Heritage, the Altadena Kiwanis Club, and a private donor have already backed the project, according to Grant.
Grant told Altadenablog that the work meant that the annual picnic would have to be cancelled this year.
The garden -- which holds a well-attended annual picnic and resource fair -- was formed in 1973 and located at the site of the former Mt. Lowe Military Academy. When the county decided to build an equestrian ring at what is now Loma Alta Park, the garden was moved to its present location. It has 64 plots and hosts a children's gardening program and Victory Garden extension classes.

The (Altadenablog sponsor) Arroyo Food Co-op reached an important milestone by signing up its 500th member earlier this week.
“We are very excited to reach this milestone,” said Tricia Keane, President of the Co-op’s Board of Directors, in a press release. “We have 500 friends in our corner rooting for us to get this store open, which means we are that much closer to bringing local, sustainable, and just plain good food to the community.”
Who the magic 500th member will actually be will be determined in a drawing of recently signed-up members.
With 500 members on board, the co-op is planning to launch a capital campaign and commit to a location for the community market. The co-op is planning to seek funding thorugh a combination of member investments, member loans, and grants. It has also engaged a local realtor to scout for commercial location in Altadena or northern Pasadena, with a goal to open in the first quarter of 2013.
“The goal of 500 members seemed daunting, nearly impossible, when we first started out,” said co-op founder Patrick Reagan, in a release from the co-op, “but today we see that the community has clearly stated that they’re willing to invest in a better option. Reaching this impressive goal is very encouraging for all of us early adopters. It should also help encourage others to join in on the fun – the building of a wonderful local grocery store we all can be proud of.”
The co-op is setting itself up as an alternative to large chain grocers, including the Altadena Walmart Neighborhood Market which is also planning to open in the first quarter of 2013.

The (Altadenablog sponsor) Altadena Farmers Market opened this afternoon at 3 PM, and by our observations and those we talked to, it sounds like a hit.
Market manager Joseph Shuldiner shows off one of the shopping carts, which can be checked out at the market.
After putting so much effort into it, market manager Joseph Shuldiner said "I'm having an out-of-body experience," but not so much out of body that he wasn't working the crowd and accepting some well-earned congratulations.
Not that there weren't some glitches along the way: parking stretched out for blocks along West Palm Street (hint: try parking at the Loma Alta gym parking lot and Lincoln and Loma Alta and walk downhill to the market). There was some interesting vehicle choreography, as it was also trash pickup day along Palm and trash trucks and cars were involved in a little dance to make it through the narrow street (Al Evans of Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation said he would talk to Athens Waste to see if they would be able to change their pickup day). And the Fox Pizzeria double-decker bus couldn't quite negotiate the hill on Dabney Street (Fox said they also ran into some mechanical problems and were looking for an emergency mechanic to try and salvage the trip).
But otherwise, it was a selection of vendors of local, artisanal foods and local boutique farms that gathered a growing crowd of folks.
Local tech writer Steve Bass said that he thought the food was a little pricey, but that didn't stop him from buying. His wife Judy Bass said that she hoped that the market would be successful and continue.
Local author Michelle Huneven, who was also at the market, waxed enthusiastic about having such a market in Altadena.
The Altadena Heritage-sponsored market will be every Wednesday from 3-7 PM, next to the Altadena Community Garden at Lincoln Avenue and Palm Street.
Students from Glenfeliz School in Atwater Village grew their own certified produce in the school garden.

First, the dormant Altadena Urban Farmers Market run by the Arroyo Time Bank has won the “Make Your Mark” competition. MYM was a project of the Think Farm and MAC+COB, creative services companies (they call it “business therapy”) that held a competition among worthy nonprofit causes for a free “rebranding package.” That includes, they say, “a brand strategy, key messaging and logo system,” as well as a print package sponsored in part by the Silver Lake Chamber of Commerce. Look for AUFM to come roaring back with a new look sometime soon.
Also, the Altadena Farmers Market, sponsored by Altadena Heritage and managed by Joseph Shuldiner’s Institute for Domestic Technology, is already all the buzz in LA area press: the LA Times food blog has already taken notice; LA Magazine likewise; and PSN weighs in on both.

Altadenans love their outdoor markets -- so with perfect Altadena weather to help out, the Eat Well Market at Camp Mariposa drew an appreciative crowd of foodies Sunday afternoon.
Organizer Aimee Silver said that there were 22 vendors at the members-only event, everything from honey to soups, and many vendors were very happy to sell out of their wares so quickly. Community organizations such as the Altadena Community Garden and Altadena Heritage also had tables at the event, held at the Girl Scout camp at Mariposa St. and Santa Rosa Avenue.
Silver said that, based on the success of Sunday's event, there will be more, although she wasn't ready to set a date for the next one. To find out how to become a member, go to eatwellmarket.com/guest-list

We were a little frightened to read in the LA Weekly that Leo Bulgarini has taken over the TeaForest Tea & Coffee Bar in Culver City as a new place to serve his creations, but we are heartened that the Altadena resident is keeping his hometown Bulgarini Gelato shop open, too (it's where he makes his product, after all).
TeaForest is keeping its locally-famous name and product line, and the Altadena gelato palace will remain open -- Leo will just adjust the local hours. Whew!

LA Weekly has a story on Black Cat Bakery chef Nick Coe, and Shu Takikawa's renowned farm in Santa Barbara. In passing, it says that the two promise to be selling their goods at the Altadena Farmer's Market, which the Weekly says will be open at the end of October.
So we decided to check up on it: Altadena market manager Joseph Shuldiner emails us: " I'm still dealing with the County to get a formal agreement signed so I can assure all the vendors and farmers that this is going to happen. I'm supposed to hear from Office of the Deputy Director of Parks this week. Keep your fingers crossed. I will without a doubt contact you as soon as I have ink drying on the page! In the meantime, I have even more amazing farmers and vendors lined up just waiting for the go ahead."

Here is a curiosity; I noticed a struggling hummingbird [turned out to be an adult female Allen's] in a backyard Lantana. On trying to free it, the "branch" it was stuck on came off with it. Oops! A mantis, which had apparently struck out at the bird. Looking for a hearty lunch? A couple of tiny feathers were stuck in the mandible. Not a high quality shot, but the best I could manage with my free right hand. I didn't want to keep the birdlet in that stressful situation too long. End of story, bird was fine, she buzzed off. The mantis was set down in a fuchsia in another location.
Actually, in the higher-res version (which we don't think makes it online) you can distinctly see a couple of feathers in the mantis' mandible. That's one ambitious (and hungry) insect!

It was not as crowded as the Grilled Cheese Truck. Lynne and I actually waited in line and sampled a couple of different things off of the menu. It was good and worth the wait.

Touched base with Patrick Reagan, one of the organizers of a food co-op in Altadena. Lots of progress underway.
For one thing, they now have a not-carved-in-stone name: Arroyo Food Co-op, which reflects the interest they've gathered from Pasadena, Eagle Rock, and other communities. For another, they have a few critical meetings coming up -- save the dates:
Oct. 10: Critical community meeting at the Altadena Community Center, where they say "If you can come to only one of our events, this is the one. Your attendance will help us gauge the degree of community support we have for bringing the co-op to our area. We need your feedback."

The Serious Eats blog goes to LA Times food critic S. Irene Virbila for the best food in LA. She leaves LA to find the best ice cream, which is actually here in Altadena. You have to guess where (OK, it's not much of a guess!) Do read the comments -- apparently the best Chinese food in LA is in a closed restaurant in Alhambra ...

The current feature at the Page 99 Test: Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine by Ronen Shamir.
Whether buried underfoot or strung overhead, electrical lines are omnipresent. Not only are most societies dependent on electrical infrastructure, but this infrastructure actively shapes electrified society. From the wires, poles, and generators themselves to the entrepreneurs, engineers, politicians, and advisors who determine the process of electrification, our electrical grids can create power—and politics—just as they transmit it.
Current Flow examines the history of electrification of British-ruled Palestine in the 1920s, as it marked, affirmed, and produced social, political, and economic difference between Arabs and Jews. Considering the interplay of British colonial interests, the Jewish-Zionist leanings of a commissioned electric company, and Arab opposition within the case of the Jaffa Power House, Ronen Shamir reveals how electrification was central in assembling a material infrastructure of ethno-national separation in Palestine long before "political partition plans" had ever been envisioned. Ultimately, Current Flow sheds new light on the history of Jewish-Arab relations and offers broader sociological insights into what happens when people are transformed from users into elements of networks.
Ronen Shamir is Professor of Sociology and Anthropology at Tel-Aviv University and author of The Colonies of Law: Colonialism, Zionism and Law in Early Mandate Palestine (2000) and Managing Legal Uncertainty: Elite Lawyers in the New Deal (1996).
At e Harmony, we know that finding compatible interracial singles, in London and the rest of the UK, can be challenging.That’s why we take time to really get to know you and find out what you’re looking for in a partner.While that might have assuaged users&apos; initial curiosity, people who messaged her kept harping on the subject. Vanessa*, 27, a woman of black and Asian heritage, also lists her racial background in her profile.Like Alyssa, she frequently receives messages pointing out how "exotic-looking" she is. But the world of online dating can be difficult in a very specific way for those who identify as multiracial. Whether it&apos;s some drunk guy saying, "You&apos;re so hot, I don&apos;t care that you&apos;re Hispanic" (I&apos;m not Hispanic), or someone finding out my dad is from India and then only wanting to talk about curry and Bollywood, my experiences as a multiracial woman have been marked by people just not knowing how to bring up race without being incredibly awkward. As a biracial person and the creator of the hashtag, I&apos;ve experienced this firsthand.But she also frequently interacts with white men who try to flatter her by saying they picked her profile specifically because they don&apos;t like to date white women."They seem to think it&apos;s a compliment or a reason why they picked my profile to interact with," Vanessa told .
Yet even though they found it tiring to field endless questions about what "mix" they were, some multiracial people told that they preferred online dating to dating IRL, as it gave them the ability to be upfront about their identity on their profile.For every person trying to decipher just what makes you look so "exotic," there&apos;s someone who acts like dating someone of mixed heritage will make them more interesting. It just makes them, at best, racially insensitive, and at worst an asshole., nearly 9% of couples are of different races, nearly twice as many as there were in 2002.People are weird about race in the dating world, though, and despite wanting to come off as progressive and open-minded, many dating app users still have racial biases.Alyssa said that putting your racial background on your profile preempts the need to have an awkward conversation about it later on."I got less weird stuff about my racial background online than I did [dating] in person," Alyssa said."In person there&apos;s not a good way to say &apos; I&apos;m biracial, don&apos;t be weird&apos; before someone makes it a thing."That said, the people who are going to make it a "thing" will likely do so, regardless of whether they&apos;re meeting you IRL or on an online dating website.
Ames Chiropractic Wellness Center is a firm believer in all natural organic supplements to help to boost your immune system and stay healthy. Ames Chiropractic Wellness Center currently is partnered with Metagenics and Standard Process.
Given proper nutrition, the human body has an amazing ability to heal itself. To do so, we need to eat a healthier diet, exercise, and take high-quality supplements made from whole foods. Whole food supplements supply our bodies with nutrients that we are not getting from our diet. All the vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, and phytonutrients that foods possess in a way that nature intended, in a whole food form is what we are all about. Only whole food supplements complete the nutritional gap. Whole food supplements are made by concentrating foods for use in supplements. When processed correctly, they supply a multitude of the plant's components. Foods provide nutrients that work together to provide you with optimal nutrition for good health.
Metagenics was founded in 1983 on a brave new scientific concept: how the right nutrition could help people realize their best health possible by influencing what makes them unique—their genes. Back then we called it “genetic potential through nutrition.” It also makes us unique—it’s been our mission and a key differentiator ever since. Today, this ever-growing and respected field of science is known as nutrigenomics. It's been practiced for nearly 30 years by forward-thinking providers who utilize our industry-leading products and programs to help people live healthier, happier lives. Now healthcare organizations worldwide recommend “lifestyle medicine” to improve health with basic nutrigenomic tenets: healthier eating and regular exercise. But we hold the key to making lifestyle medicine programs more effective, as well as more expedient with targeted nutritional support.

One hundred years ago this week, news reports abounded in speculation to how one of the most famous escapes from an Irish and Cork prison occurred. On 11 November 1918 Donegal-born Donnacha McNeilus, in an elaborate plan involving dozens of men on the outside, was spirited to freedom.
The only aspect remaining of the Cork County Gaol and later renamed Cork Male Prison is its architecturally perfect Doric entrance portico. It was built in 1818 off Western Road under the direction of the Inspector General of Prisons. The winner of the contract for building the “House of Correction” or the chosen architects were George and Richard Pain Brothers. It had a central block from which three, three-storey buildings stuck out from as well as two detached wings. Embedded into the prison’s architecture were ideas of surveillance, separation and silence and these were essential to the reform programme for prisoners. The centre block had also the Governor’s residence on the ground floor, a chapel for Catholics and Protestants on the second floor and an infirmary on the third floor. The radiating buildings provided a panoptical gaze and consisted of 78 cells with washing rooms in each area. Work rooms were located on the ground floor and a detached limestone church could be seen between the earlier gaol and the “house”. The gaol was constructed to keep people in and was heavily guarded.
Fast forward to 4 November 1918 five armed RIC men, under the command of Head Constable Clarke, raided the lodgings of a Cork Volunteer named Donnchadh McNeilus (a Donegal man) with a view to his arrest. He was staying in the house of a man named Denis Kelleher at 28 Leitrim Street, Cork. McNeilus resisted arrest; he was armed with a revolver and, in the struggle, he shot and badly wounded Head Constable Clarke. McNeilus was eventually overpowered and taken prisoner to the then Cork Male Prison, formerly with the name Cork County Gaol.
Commandant of the 2nd Battalion of the Cork No.1 Brigade Michael Murphy in a statement (document no WS1547) for the Bureau of Military History in 1956 detailed part of the reason for the escape plan. if Constable Clarke died MacNeilus would almost certainly be hanged, so the Cork Brigade officers took steps to bring about his rescue as soon as possible. Visits to McNeilus in gaol were made by various Volunteers and, in the course of these visits, a note was passed to him telling him to be prepared for anything’. On the afternoon of 11 November 1918, a number of Volunteers, armed with revolvers, began their prison break mission. The names of these Volunteers included Joe Murphy, Martin Donovan, Chris McSweeney, Paddy Healy, Frank McCarthy, Jerome Donovan and Paddy Varian. Frank McCarthy was dressed in clerical clothes to allay suspicion.
In 1918, Frank Hynes, Captain No.1 in the Cork Brigade at that time, was also involved in the planning of the escape plan. His witness statement in the Bureau of Military History in Collin Barracks in Dublin (document no WS446) details the actual escape plan itself. There was no limit to visitors going to see a prisoner. Inside the big wooden gate was a waiting room. Between the wooden gate and a big iron gate was a type of a hall wide enough for a lorry to pass through both gates; outside the iron gate a path led up a hill to the cells. Joe Murphy and Jerome Donovan called to see McNeilus and ten minutes later two more called. They were in the waiting room with a guard who had the keys of both gates. The plan entailed when the two visitors who were with the prisoner, when their visit was coming to an end, they were to knock out the guard. The two volunteers in the waiting room were to calculate the end of the visit at the time, knock out their man and open the gates.
A fifth man was placed outside the wooden gate to direct McNeilus round by the jail wall and onto the cross roads at Gaol Cross with Western Road where a motor car waited. On Gaol Bridge was a sixth man and his duty was to hold up any soldiers who might come to go into the jail. As luck would have it, two soldiers came along in a horse and tumbling cart. He held them up, got them down from the cart and made them stand on the bridge, He was worried that more would come, and he took the other man away from the gate to look after the soldiers, so that he would be free to watch the road. The result was that McNeilus had no one to guide him when he came out.
In the interim inside in the waiting room the warder spotted something suspicious about his two waiting visitors and he went to the ‘phone to report, but one of them broke his jaw with a sandbag and the other knocked him out with his baton. In the meantime, the visitors with McNeilus knocked out their warden, but coming down they found a soldier with a rifle marching up and down by the iron gate. They watched until he had turned back on his beat from them, then they went to the gate which the other lads had opened. McNeilus rushed out the other gate and straight up the road towards the main road. A youngster was practising on a bike up and down the road. McNeilus flung him off, got on the bike and cycled rapidly on.

CHARLES Stanley, the city broker and investment manager, yesterday said its interim revenues were on track to keep pace with last year’s figures, despite the depression in transaction volumes seen across the City broking sector.
The firm said it expected to report revenues for March to September at “around the same level” as last year, when total income came in at £60.2m.
The firm said it expected to hit a similar figure despite a reduction in transaction volumes and subsequent drop in commission income.
Brokers have been struggling to maintain growth on the back of very quiet trading activity, with several reporting falls last week.
However, Charles Stanley said fee income is set to have grown year on year, helping hold up revenues.
Costs are also expected to have increased, including a £1.4m hit from paying a contribution to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

Is flaxseed the new wonder food? Preliminary studies show that it may help figLD heart disease, diabetes and breast cancer.Some call it one of the most powerful plant foods on the planet. Thereâs some evidence it may help reduce your risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes. Thatâs quite a tall order for a tiny seed thatâs been around for centuries.
Flaxseed oil is available in liquid and soft gel capsules. This oil requires special packaging because it is easily destroyed by heat, ligLD and oxygen. Some forLD of flaxseed oil may require refrigeration.Flaxseed is found in all kinds of today's foods from crackers to frozen waffles to oatmeal. The Flax Council estimates close to 300 new flax-based products were launched in the U.S. and Canada in 2010 alone. Not only has consumer demand for flaxseed grown, agricultural use has also increased. Flaxseed is what's used to feed all those chickens that are laying eggs with higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids.

Palm fruit initially grew in west Africa, while it was immigrated to Asia to be planted to the most. Nowadays, Malaysia has the largest planting plantation and Indonesia the second. As time goes on, our eating habit is changing everyday, palm fruit oil has been our mainly daily edible oil instead of soybean oil and rapeseed oil. Palm fruit is productive, with the rigLD climate, which is tropical climate, and a lot of rain, the palm fruit can grow very well.In Malaysia and Indonesia, plantations are big, In Africa and Middle America, the plantations are expanding day by day,people are waiting to plant large area palm fruit to produce more oil and make good fortune.
In order to meet the different kinds of market, we have researched and designed some different technologies and equipment for different customers, we have large lines for 40-80TPH,middle lines for 20-40TPH, and small lines for 1-20TPH. We have finished both big and small lines in Africa, America and in South Asia.
The palm fruit bunch will be transported by the conveyor to the palm fruit cage car and then the palm fruit cage car will be transported to the sterilizer and begin the sterilizing. We have vertical sterilizer for smaller lines, and horizontal sterilizers for big lines.
After the sterilizing, the palm fruit bunch will be transported to the thresher, in the thresher drum, the palm fruit seed will be separated from the empty palm fruit bunch.
After the threshing part, the palm fruit seed will be transported to the digestor, the structure of palm fruit seed will be adjusted to the most suitable state for pressing ,which can help you to get more oil and have more profit.
After we get the oil from pressing station, we need to clarify the oil and make it much cleaner and more clear. During this section, we will use setting tank and centrifuge to make the oil much more clear.
The palm nut will be separated from the fiber, stones. After then the palm nut shall be cracked, and then separate the shell from the kernel.

A fab '70s fashion documentary and other indie flicks screening in November November 1 by Solomon Gustavo
There are few things in the Twin Cities that kick off the holiday season more emphatically than Ike Reilly's annual Thanksgiving show. Drunk dude-bros, drunk indie kids, and drunk gray-hairs alike pack sardine-like into First Ave, hollering along to every song with an unmatched sense of camaraderie. In previous years, the show's just been one hell of a party, with the exhausted band finally leaving the stage a few minutes before bar close after playing most of their extensive library. This year promises to be no less wild, but the Assassination has added a genuine holiday hook. The full proceeds from the show will be donated to local cancer victim Takashi Yoshino, whose story seems a little reminiscent of an Ike tune: A recovered heroin addict, Yoshino has been working for nearly 20 years as a counselor helping others recover from addiction and get off the street. At the risk of sounding corny, maybe shouting the lyrics to "Put a Little Love in It" through a rum-and-coke haze will have a little more meaning this year. With Little Man and the Alarmists. 18+. $12/$15 at the door. 7:30 p.m. 701 1st Ave. N., Minneapolis; 612.332.1775. —Ward Rubrecht
This Friday night the Varsity Theater will host a CD-release party for Ed Ackerson's new record, Ackerson2 (Susstones). The album is the multitalented musician's third release within the past year and was written, recorded, and produced exclusively by Ackerson at his Flowers Studio. Marc Perlman of the Jayhawks, Janey Winterbauer of Astronaut Wife, and Farewell Continental are all set to make guest appearances throughout the evening, performing in addition to the night's opening acts, Colonial Vipers Attack and StrangeLights. Ackerson himself is set to take the stage with three bands throughout the night, playing with the Mood Swings and the Ed Ackerson Group in addition to his mainstay, Polara. If the extensive list of scheduled performers is any indication, the night could very well see a few more special guests from among any number of friends Ackerson has made throughout his acclaimed 20-year career. 18+. $8. 8 p.m. 1308 4th Street SE, Minneapolis; 612.604.0222. —Chris DeLine
This local cable-access show has gained a cult following here in Minneapolis, and the program lives up to its name. A mix of sketch comedy, variety, and talk show, DWI also has a resident bartender, Ollie Stench, who alternately abuses the audience and plies it with potent shots during each episode (usually three are filmed in one night). The result is a boisterous crowd always eager to hoot and holler at whatever host Ian Rans has up his sleeve. There is a super-secret musical guest for each episode, and past interviewees have included everyone from the North Star Roller Girls to a 911 operator who wrote a book about her experiences. Everything is executed with tongue firmly in cheek and shot glass firmly in hand. The end product has the look and feel of a late-night TV show that erupted out of a house party in your parents' basement, and that certainly seems to be the intention. There are no bells and whistles (the guest couch is a bench seat from a Dodge caravan), and the jokes and sketches have to prop up the show instead of vice versa, which is so common with late-night shows these days. A good time is guaranteed—but make sure to bring cab fare. 21+. $6. 8 p.m. 701 First Ave. N., Minneapolis; 612.332.1775. —Pat O'Brien
An amazing, unexpected fate befell Kimya Dawson earlier this year: The squeak-lunged, anti-folkin' woman-child hit the big time. A fresh-faced crop of admirers may've gotten hip to Dawson's affectingly unvarnished warble recently by way of the Juno soundtrack—and body-slammed her with more MySpace friend requests than she could handle—but she's been on the indie grind all decade. Dawson and fellow absurdist Adam Green performed together as the Moldy Peaches before putting the group on "hiatus" and going their separate, solo ways in 2004. Since tracking her earliest, post-millennium recordings, Dawson's bounced her rudimentary songwriting Super Ball between ragged, devastating displays of over-empathy; snotty eff-Bush, eff-bullshit activist polemics; precocious/profound familial asides; gushing paeans to friends; and the kind of nursery-rhyme-ish kindergarten anthems adults can relate to. How—and whether—this proud mom and notoriously shy and generous performer capitalizes on her present visibility is an open question. The just-released Alphabutt (K Records) is more kiddo-friendly detour than anything else, but let's hope Dawson eventually delivers an album-length statement that fully crystallizes her so-open-hearted-she's-bleeding appeal. All ages. $12/$15 at the door. 2:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. 416 Cedar Ave. S, Minneapolis; 612.338.2674. —Ray Cummings
There would seem to be a natural affinity between Shelby Lynne and Dusty Springfield. But it took a suggestion from an unlikely source—schmaltz king Barry Manilow—for Lynne to finally recruit producer Phil Ramone and put together what has to be considered the definitive tribute to the late blue-eyed soul diva. On Just a Little Lovin' (Lost Highway), released earlier this year, Lynne easily asserts her own personality and style while finding the essence of Springfield in songs running the gamut from her mid-'60s British pop hits to her later, landmark foray in Memphis. Both singular singers with deep currents of soul, both somewhat misunderstood and eclectic enough to bristle at constraints, Springfield and Lynne each gain added dimension on Lovin'. Glossy pop nuggets like "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me" and "I Only Want to Be with You" become intimate emotional exercises in the adept hands of Lynne and her spare band. On some of Dusty's Memphis material, like Tony Joe White's "Willie and Laura Mae Jones," Lynne lets out her sultry, swampy side while guitarist Dean Parks paints the blues, one classic inspiring another. With David McMillion. $30. 8 p.m. 2004 Randolph Ave., St. Paul; 651.690.6700. —Rick Mason
Though emo existed before Enigk's old band, Sunny Day Real Estate, released their 1994 landmark, Diary, it seems that the much-maligned genre didn't have a name until just then. Emo has since become a watered-down commodity with very few constant elements, aside from the now-target audience of tween girls with silly wardrobes and ill-advised haircuts, but at the time nobody knew what to do with it, and it existed almost in a vacuum. Enigk sang like Yes's Jon Anderson, and instead of burying his feelings in super-hip metaphors like many of his Seattle contemporaries were doing, he wrote lyrics that were more straightforward and made the listener want to cry at nearly every turn. SDRE was an unstable union, however (possibly due to Enigk's abrupt rebirth as a devout Christian and the release of his first solo album, Return of the Frog Queen), and after a couple of short-lived reunions (and an equally short-lived band, the Fire Theft, with some of his SDRE mates) Enigk is firmly on his own, his third album in roughly three years on the way. He is one of those rare artists who holds fans' attention, keeping them equally curious about what's next as well as what he's doing in the present. With Wishbook. 18+. $15. 7 p.m.1308 Fourth St. SE, Minneapolis; 612.604.0222. —Pat O'Brien
A human dynamo who at age 50 has more electrifying energy than entire—hell, multiple—bands a fraction her age, Sharon Jones may not have Tina Turner's legs, as she says, but she's sure got the voice, the spirit, and the moves. Only in the last few years has Jones, after hooking up with the rudiments of what would become her muscular band, the Dap-Kings, emerged into the spotlight as a no-holds-barred soul and R&B diva in the classic sense of Motown and Memphis. She honed her big, glorious voice singing gospel growing up in Augusta, Georgia, then spent decades as an unheralded backup singer until even those jobs dried up and she wound up guarding prisoners at New York's notorious Riker's Island and shipments for Wells Fargo. To see her and her horn-blasting Dap-Kings now is like revisiting a sweaty soul revue at the Apollo three or four decades back: frenetic stepping out by Jones, swaggering horns, tumultuous rhythms, searing guitar, and fresh soul, funk, and R&B nuggets that easily slip alongside vintage material. Their latest, 100 Days, 100 Nights (Daptone), has even generated radio play for the title track and the wrenching "Something's Changed." All ages. $27.50. 7:30 p.m. 710 Hennepin Ave., Minneapolis; 612.339.7007. —Rick Mason
How was the 2016 Sigur Rós show at the Orpheum, acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker? November 9 by Keith Harris
Noted as one of the nation's premier heritage and cultural museums, the National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, Tennessee, is steadfast in its mission to share the culture and lessons from the American Civil Rights Movement and explore how this significant era continues to shape equality and freedom globally.
Established in 1991, the National Civil Rights Museum is located at the former Lorraine Motel, where civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated on April 4, 1968. Through interactive exhibits, historic collections, dynamic speakers and special events, the museum offers visitors a chance to walk through history and learn more about a tumultuous and inspiring period of change.
To accommodate public demand for further educational opportunities, the museum underwent a $27.5 million renovation in 2013 and 2014, adding more than 40 new films, oral histories and interactive media to the already robust galleries. The result is a one-of-a-kind experience that has been featured on the History Channel and CNN, in USA Today and as the focus for the Academy Award-nominated documentary The Witness: From the Balcony of Room 306.
Additionally, the museum is among the top 5% of institutions to be accredited by the American Alliance of Museums and is a founding member of the International Coalition of Sites of Conscience, which brings together historic sites, museums and memory initiatives from all around the globe that connect past struggles to today’s movements for human rights and social justice.
The National Civil Rights Museum, located at the Lorraine Motel, the assassination site of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., chronicles key episodes of the American Civil Rights Movement, examines today's global civil and human rights issues, provokes thoughtful debate and serves as a catalyst for positive social change.
The Lorraine Civil Rights Museum Foundation, DBA National Civil Rights Museum, is located at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, the historic site where civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. In addition to housing one of the premiere cultural museums in the United States, the Lorraine Motel boasts an interesting story of its own.
Purchased by Walter Bailey in 1945 and renamed the Lorraine Hotel, after his wife Loree and a song titled "Sweet Lorraine". At the time of purchase, the Lorraine included a cafe; and living quarters for the Baileys.
A two-story concrete block motel structure was built to the east of the hotel in 1955. It contained 16 rooms.
The Lorraine was one of only a few hotels to which African-American travelers could enjoy overnight accommodations during the segregated eras leading up to the late 1960s in America.
Under the Baileys' ownership, there were at least two major additions to the hotel– first, a second floor with 12 rooms and later, more guest rooms and drive-up access. This change converted the Lorraine Hotel into a motel.
Guests of the Lorraine, both black and white, returned many times for its upscale atmosphere, home-cooked meals, affordable prices and reputation as a clean, safe environment.
Songwriters and musicians working with Stax Records were frequent residents of the Lorraine. Recording stars Ray Charles, Lionel Hampton, Aretha Franklin, Ethel Waters, Otis Redding, The Staple Singers and Wilson Pickett were among the many who stayed in the Lorraine during the late 1950s and early 1960s.
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stayed at the Lorraine Motel numerous times, especially when he came to Memphis in 1968 in support of striking sanitation workers.
The National Civil Rights Museum at the Lorraine Motel is a very special experience that takes visitors through centuries of history. Have a question? You might find the answer in our FAQs section.

Step into Amish country for this bittersweet holiday romance. Here you'll meet Will Henderson, a young man tortured by his past, and Karen Yoder, a young woman looking for answers. Add a desperate father searching for his son, and you have all the ingredients for a first-class romance that will inspire and enthrall.
The Amish life fascinates me, and I've thoroughly enjoyed many of the Amish-themed books I've read. I've never read Wanda Brunstetter before, but she came highly rated and this one looked interesting.
The story centers around Will Henderson, an English boy who, at the age of 6, is left with an Amish couple. His father ostensibly plans to return for him, but through lost messages and miscommunications, never does. Will grows up believing that his father abandoned him. Predictably, as his impending wedding to Karen nears, Will finds that he harbors many doubts about his father and an unforgiving heart. Conveniently, at Thanksgiving, his father suddenly reappears in Will's life.
I'd call this Amish-light. It's a sweet novel with a great deal of unrealized potential. The characters are one-dimensional and the misunderstandings and lack of communication are far-fetched and unrealistic. The ending is convenient and contrived. Will and Karen and the rest of the cast don't inspire any compassion whatsoever. The recipe for the White Christmas Pie mentioned in the story is included in the book. My impression is that the author thought it would be a cute gimmick, but instead of a rich story with depth, we are left with the sugary fluff.
From other reviews I've seen, most of Brunstetter's books receive better reviews than this one has, so I will not count her out yet. Overall, a sweet story. A light, easy read. Nothing more.
After Peak Marcello is arrested for scaling a New York City skyscraper, he's left with two choices: wither away in Juvenile Detention or go live with his long-lost father, who runs a climbing company in Thailand. But Peak quickly learns that his father's renewed interest in him has strings attached. Big strings. He wants Peak to be the youngest person to reach the Everest summit--and his motives are selfish at best. Even so, for a climbing addict like Peak, tackling Everest is the challenge of a lifetime. But it's also one that could cost him his life. Roland Smith has created an action-packed adventure about friendship, sacrifice, family, and the drive to take on Everest, despite the incredible risk. Peak is a novel readers won't be able to put down.
This review is from E, my avid 10-year old reader. He dictated it so, for the most part, these are his words.
This book is about a boy named Peak whose dad gives him an opportunity to summit Mount Everest with him. If Peak makes it to the top before his 15th birthday, he will become the youngest person ever to summit Everest.
Peak and his dad go to Everest together. His dad has climbed before and so he often goes ahead of Peak because he's used to the lack of oxygen. Peak and his friend Sun-Jo, the grandson of a sherpa, climb together. This book is very descriptive and talks about the views and how difficult it is to climb Everest and even about the sicknesses you can get.
This book is really entertaining. It holds your attention. I had a hard time putting it down, even when I was at school. Seriously. I sometimes snuck in some reading during math. I could not put it down.
In this book, there is a sentence that says, "For a climber, saying that you are stopping by Everest is like saying you are stopping by to see God." This sentence is kind of true, because this is the biggest mountain in the world and one of the most amazing things you can see.

I receive a lot of review books, but I have never once told lies about the book just because I got a free copy of it. However, some authors seem to feel that if they send you a copy of their book for free, you should give it a positive review.
Do you think reviewers are obligated to put up a good review of a book, even if they don’t like it? Have we come to a point where reviewers *need* to put up disclaimers to (hopefully) save themselves from being harassed by unhappy authors who get negative reviews?
As always, another terrific question. I started reviewing books mostly by accident. I love to read and I wanted a way to keep track of what I read. I started this blog to do exactly that: keep track. My early reviews are pretty brief. I soon found though, that I liked writing up reviews and being creative. I started finding other book blogs and making new friends through Goodreads too. I was finding new books to read, many of which I wouldn't have read without first seeing a recommendation from someone else.
I think that honesty is very important. I, for one, want to know what someone really thinks about a book. I don't want a sanitized version of the jacket synopsis. I've tried to be honest in all my reviewing and because of that I've posted some negative reviews. Several negative reviews came from books I had received as ARCs for free. Did I relish writing negative reviews? No. But, I couldn't say that I liked a book when I didn't. I've had several authors comment on my reviews, but only one commented on a negative review. And, while they said they respected my opinion, it was clear that they'd taken offense. I felt bad for that, but I truly didn't like the book, and I found nothing redeeming about the main characters.
It can't be easy, as an author, to see negative reviews of something you've put your heart and soul into. Every writer has an idea in their mind of what they want their books to say and how they want them received. Every reader has expectations about books, whether from what is clearly printed on the back of the book, their own experiences or other reviews. To have every reader love and adore the book like they do is incredibly unrealistic for any author.
Should negative reviews be softened? Perhaps. On this one particular review, I did go back and softened a couple of sentences which, in hindsight, were probably unnecessarily harsh, but I didn't change my review.
Over the last couple of weeks, I've watched some of the drama on other blogs, with honest reviews and angry author responses. And, perhaps "disclaimers" on our blogs aren't a bad idea. I may work on one of those. But, I also think that if an author is going to send out a book for review, they should check out the blogger ahead of time. If the book is a legal thriller and that blogger hasn't been very positive about legal thrillers, then don't send them the book and expect a glowing review. And on the same note, I've become more selective about which ARCs I will review. For awhile, I just accepted every ARC that came my way, but after some experience, now, if I truly think I won't like it, I won't request or accept it.
The first book of its kind, First Families will provide a lively look at how first families struggle to deal with the new life imposed on them, find a balance between their public and private selves, and create a family home amid the grandeur. Indeed, over the years the White House has taken on the character of a living force, shaping and warping the families it shelters.
First Families is the more than 200–year–old story of these wives, children, extended families and pets of 42 presidents who have lived in the White House, all with mixed feelings about the delights and drawbacks of the dwelling that is both a symbol and a home.
First Families weaves together the stories of presidents and their families, from George Washington to George W. Bush, to capture the intense ups and downs of their lives, both public and private, at the White House. In addition to chronicling dark moments in the lives of the first families and the nation––when presidents walked within the living rooms and bedrooms of White House determining whether or not to go to war––Bonnie Angelo also provides fascinating behind–the–scenes accounts of the illnesses and deaths of children and spouses within those same rooms, the stirrings of love, the squabbles of marriage, the joyful weddings of sons and daughters.
A fascinating account of life in the White House. What is it like being a First Family? How has life in the White House changed over the years? How was it different for Dolley Madison, Bess Truman and Jacqueline Kennedy? Which first ladies were beloved by all and which were the most difficult to like? Who is responsible for the Japanese cherry trees which blossom each April? Who was married in the White House and which presidential children got into the most trouble?
I found this an entertaining and easy book to read. Some stories I'd heard before, but most were new. Bonnie Angelo is a longtime correspondent for Time and reported on the White House for years. She's definitely done her research and shares many delightful anecdotes about past presidents and their first ladies and families, from George Washington to George W. Bush. We learn which First Ladies relished their roles and which ones were reluctant celebrities.
While Ms. Angelo cites many references, she doesn't do so until the end of the book. I found myself wishing that there were footnotes so that I could check references and sources, none of which are found in the actual text. She does have an extensive bibliography at the end of the book, many of which sound interesting and will probably end up on my reading list!
A kind, bookish only child born in the 1940s, Alice Lindgren has no idea that she will one day end up in the White House, married to the president. In her small Wisconsin hometown, she learns the virtues of politeness, but a tragic accident when she is seventeen shatters her identity and changes the trajectory of her life. More than a decade later, when the charismatic son of a powerful Republican family sweeps her off her feet, she is surprised to find herself admitted into a world of privilege. And when her husband unexpectedly becomes governor and then president, she discovers that she is married to a man she both loves and fundamentally disagrees with–and that her private beliefs increasingly run against her public persona. As her husband’s presidency enters its second term, Alice must confront contradictions years in the making and face questions nearly impossible to answer.
While it has its interesting moments, this was one of those books that disappointed me and one I really struggled to finish. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but it wasn't this.
I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more if it were a true work of fiction, with characters completely created from the author's imagination. There are some bibliographical references at the end of the novel about the books which inspired her to write this piece of work. The main character is modeled after Laura Bush, and while the author admits this, I wish she'd just written a biography about Mrs. Bush, rather than some thinly disguised piece of fiction. She's also modeled the Blackwell family after the Bush family, including the President, and having read several Bush biographies, I can definitely see her similarities.
I have always liked Laura Bush, and I'd certainly rather read a real biography/autobiography than a fictionalized one. While I'm sure this wasn't authorized or approved by Mrs. Bush, if it was me, I certainly wouldn't be happy knowing it was "based" on my life.
The book has moderate profanity and too many unnecessary s*x scenes, all of which are far too detailed and most are not necessary to the story line.
How do you cope when God asks you to bury a dream? In this new series by best-selling author Angela Hunt, readers will meet Jennifer Graham, the no-nonsense chief of staff for a Virginia senator who quits her job after a divorce and finds herself an unemployed single mom. Forced to live with her mother until she can find work on Capitol Hill that does not involve her gregarious ex-husband, her efforts are stymied until she learns that she has inherited a funeral home in picturesque Mt. Dora. Jennifer journeys to the small Florida town with her two sons and her mother, never dreaming that within a mortuary she will discover she has inherited a rewarding career that teaches her far more about life than death.
After a painful divorce, Jennifer Graham finds that she has inherited a small-town funeral home from an elderly great uncle. Needing a fresh start, she and her children move from Virginia to Florida. The Fairlawn funeral home is in need of remodeling and repair, much like Jen's own life.
As Jen embarks on this new journey, she meets new people, makes new friends and learns about herself and her relationship with God along the way. The Christian theme is subtle throughout the book.
The story is light and predictable. Jen decides to keep Fairlawn, and run it, rather than sell it. There is very little depth and minor character development. It's a nice little story that had potential. I liked Jen. I loved Gerald. I thought the ex-husband was a cad, but there was also very little backstory and the conclusion was just a little too convenient for me.
My big complaint with this story is the narration. Jen's story is told in first-person, which I rarely like. The chapters then alternate between Jen and the other characters like her mom, Gerald, and her son. These supporting characters aren't written as first-person, but are an awkward present-tense third-person narrative. It was actually quite annoying and very distracting. The story would have been much stronger had the author maintained the same style throughout it.
I'd love to have books for all of you, but I could only choose one for each book...so the winners are...

They cracked the secret of successful differentiation that is not imitated and are adored by customers who think that they are incomparable. Dr. Dan Herman calls it an Unfair Competitive Advantage. It's not at all unethical. Everyone has a fair chance of attaining such an advantage including, every reader of this book.
There is a secret to successful differentiation that is not imitated. It is a psychological secret that has to do with the way your competitors think. Most marketers today are MBA graduates who tend to think and operate in typical and predictable ways - you might call them MBA Clones. You can take advantage of their biases and outsmart them. In this groundbreaking book, Dr. Dan Herman not only reveals the secret of successful differentiation that is not imitated but also supplies you with a comprehensive set of practical rules and tools that will enable you to make an unfair advantage your reality.
Dr. Herman, a competitive strategy consultant with vast global experience, a seasoned CMO in a large corporation, a branding professional and a businessman, does not tell you to 'think out of the box' as so many do he provides you with a new and comprehensive toolbox for success.
-- How to integrate a business model, a competitive strategy and a brand concept to create a unitary 'unique success formula' for your company
-- How to use electrifying marketing, just-on-desire branding and the brand drama approach to build emotionally powerful brands, and many other useful additions to your profit-generating arsenal of concepts and methods.
Using a plethora of examples from top businesses around the world, Dr. Herman offers a business oriented-point of view that is fresh and different, and even humorous at times. Even though this book will turn your thinking inside out, everything in it is practical and easily applicable in any kind of business.
This was another book that I thought would interest my husband, so when I was offered the chance to review this book, I took it. He read it and what follows is his review.
I have a simple rating for business books. It goes like this: Did I get something from the book that will increase my income by at least 5x the cost of the book. If so, then it was a worthwhile read.
I liked it. It’s not the most easy read, which I believe may have something to do with the fact that it’s translated into English, but it’s certainly not badly written. If you want to get a different viewpoint on customer/client psychology and have your ideas widened a little, then this is a book worth your time.

Peaceful Endings: The NOPOSAM Project, is a time labeled techno thriller set on the landscape of Rhode Island over two and a half days, where some doubtful government ethics go astray. When Coventry General Hospital overflows with sick patients that are dying from extremely minor injuries, trauma specialist, Dr. Marilynn Harwell, is bound and determined to stop it. Harwell's chance meeting with Doug Talbot, a television cameraman for Channel 16, entwines the two in a race against time to find an antidote. When General Thomas Uxbridge, head of the SIA, a man with his own agenda, puts the two under suspicion, their own lives become threatened, leading to two climactic endings.
When I was offered the chance to review this book, I asked Alan if he thought it sounded interesting to him. He said yes. So, what follows is his review.
As a quick read--this was o.k. The plot was a little simplistic, which kind of spoilt the ending. Some books you read wondering how it’s going to end--this one you read wondering how the author will get you to the ending you’ve already worked out way beforehand.
The characterisations were rather one dimensional--the good guys were good, the bad guys were bad, and there wasn’t any form of development on either side. I like real characters--ones who have failings, and personal dichotomies. Show me someone in life who is one dimensional and I’ll show you either a fanatic or a fool.
Is this a book to buy--not if it’s the only one you’re buying this week. Is this a book to pick up at the library--sure.

Having fled in disgrace more than two years earlier, Hannah finally has found happiness in the Englischer world, as well as love with Martin Palmer, a man with whom she can safely entrust her heart. But almost immediately after her arrival in Owl’s Perch, the disapproval of those who ostracized her reopens old wounds.
As Hannah encounters former fiancë Paul Waddell, truths unknown to her surface about the events during her absence and she faces an agonizing decision. Will she choose the Englischer world and the man who restored her hope, or will she return to the Plain Life-and perhaps her first love?
The concluding book to the Sisters of the Quilt series, this picks up literally at the end of the second one, When the Morning Comes. After receiving a troubling phone call from her sister, Hannah returns to Owl's Perch to find her dear friend Matthew injured in a fire and his brother dead. She finds that belief in the rumors and lies which drove her away still lingers in the hearts of some of her people. She can see her sister suffering from mental illness and her father in denial of that illness. Hannah, now a nurse, is thrown together with her former fiance Paul, now a family counselor, as they try and get her sister the help she needs.
As Hannah reconnects with Paul, will she find that her love for him has never dimmed, or will she choose to return to Martin and the English life to which she has adapted? Will her father ever accept her? Can they all find forgiveness as lies and the circumstances under which Hannah left are exposed?
Cindy Woodsmall has crafted a terrific conclusion to her trilogy. The characters continue to be compelling and you really care about them. I think she's done a terrific job of detailing the Old Order Amish, Mennonite and English worlds, and how they can and cannot mesh. Although the ending was somewhat predictable, I found it satisfying how everything worked out and who ended up with whom.
I found it interesting that the quilt of the series title isn't a more substantial part of the books. The "Past and Present" quilt that Hannah starts in the first book is mentioned in all of the books and finally comes full circle in the end, but almost as an afterthought. I would have thought the quilt would find more prominence throughout the story.
Her relationship with former fiancé Paul Waddell in tatters, Hannah Lapp has fled her home in hopes of finding refuge with another Amish outcast, her shunned Aunt Zabeth in Ohio. Hampered by limited education and hiding her true identity, Hannah struggles to understand the confusing world of the Englischers and embrace unfamiliar freedoms, but a deepening friendship with the handsome Martin Palmer renews her courage to face the future.
Meanwhile, Hannah’s absence and the distressing events that led to her disappearance create turmoil among her loved ones in Owl’s Perch, Pennsylvania. Her father stubbornly refuses to search for her or to acknowledge increasing signs of instability in daughter Sarah, who suffers secret guilt over her sister’s ruined reputation. Fiancé Paul Waddell is wracked with regret over his betrayal of Hannah’s trust and is concerned with her whereabouts. He befriends Hannah’s remaining allies–brother Luke, best friend Mary, and loyal Matthew Esh–trying to convince them to help search for his love.
The second book in the Sisters of the Quilt series, this book picks up from the end of the first book. Hannah has fled Owl's Perch and sought refuge in Ohio with the aunt she never knew. Her Aunt Zabeth was shunned years before and she shows Hannah the love and understanding that her family couldn't give her. Believing that her relationship with Paul is over, she finds new hope and romance with Martin, an Englischer raised by Aunt Zabeth.
Hannah finds a purpose and career in nursing and as she becomes more comfortable in the English world, finds herself torn between her new life and her old one. When tragedy strikes those she loves back in Owl's Perch, she knows she must return. But, will she come back to Ohio?
A quick read. I found myself anxious for the next book. You really learn a lot about the Old Order Amish, and much of it isn't positive. The people live a simple life, yes, but it is a life very much restricted by the man who is their bishop. There is little talk of forgiveness, the whole focus is on doing what is right, regardless of your personal wants or desires. It is in the world of the English where Hannah truly learns where her faith lies and how God speaks to her.
After Hannah leaves the order, several of her family members begin talking about the situation and realize that she was, indeed, telling the truth about her assault. But, can they bring her back and does she want to return? That becomes the question.
The side story of her sister Sarah's psychological issues is interesting. I will be curious to see how it plays out.

Digital technologies have allowed for unparalleled advancements in the management and efficiency of air transport and space resources. While this greatly improves data and information gathering, analysis and usage, it also requires the implementation of multiple interconnected platforms that open copious cyber threat access points.
Orbiting hundreds or thousands of miles above the Earth, spacecraft, including vital communications and navigation satellites, have been considered safe from aggression or attack. However, they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to cyber attack. There are a number of possible intrusion points: antennas on satellites and ground stations, the landlines that connect ground stations to terrestrial networks, and the user terminals that connect to satellites. Hackers, if they’re sophisticated enough, can monitor data, insert corrupted data, or even shut down all communications. A satellite can be permanently rendered useless by an attack that directs a satellite to expend its propellant supply or cause damage to its own electronics and sensors.
Similarly, as the air industry becomes more dependent on software to manage operating, information and communications systems, cyber access points have increased dramatically. This can lead to vulnerabilities that could compromise customer data, lead to fatal malfunctions in air traffic management or disrupt vital supply chains, among many other things.
The laws regarding cybersecurity of space assets, aviation and other critical infrastructure remain in their infancy. The Center supports research in this important topic, and will continue to contribute to the ongoing dialog regarding best preventive practices and procedures.
Located amidst several residential areas and commercial areas in Alexandria, Virginia, Szechuan Delight sure pulls in a crowd. Serving Chinese food, mainly Szechuan cuisine, Szechuan Delight outshines its competitors by offering healthy food, good service, and a cozy environment. Despite the name, the menu not only covers Szechuan dishes, but Cantonese and Hunan as well, and even Americanized Chinese food, drawing local residents and visitors from all around the world.
The key to success for a restaurant, first of all, is offering delicious food. Szechuan Delight pays great attention to the materials, on top of serving tasty meals. Tom Chee, the owner of Szechuan Delight goes to the markets in person to make sure the food materials are fresh and of high quality. To standout amongst the competition, Tom Chee follows his own principle——quality is the soul of offering food. Unlike others, he insists on using the chicken breast, the best part of a chicken, as a main ingredient to ensure dishes are palatable. In addition, sanitation is another of Tom Chee’s main points of emphasis. He knows that keeping the kitchen clean is a must in order to prepare safe, tasty dishes. For the menu, Szechuan Delight features in General Tso’s Chicken, Szechuan Chicken, and Rice Noodle Singapore Style. Though the menu has not changed much since its opening, customers still come in an endless stream. They get accustomed to the flavor here, and would prefer that things stay the same. Naturally, there are a number of healthy dishes on the menu, free of oil and MSG, but still packed with taste. What’s more, vegetarians can also find something for themselves in Szechuan Delight. Focusing on healthy food, the restaurant and its staff have been working hard to cater to various customers.
Customers can choose to sit on chairs and wait for their dishes to come out or watch the chef cooking. Standing next to the cash register, customers have a clear view of the chef preparing the dishes, helping alleviate any possible concerns about food sanitation. Even though Szechuan Delight has been open for almost twenty five years, it is always kept clean and tidy, adhering to strict standards.
Last but not least, Szechuan Delight has been keen on good service. The staff members are friendly and efficient with their big smiles and prompt action. Being attentive without being pushy, they always serve customers in a cheerful manner. For new customers, they recommend popular dishes while for regular customers, they remember their usual orders. Regular customers get along well with the staff, and every time they choose to order from Szechuan Delight, they are served like family. In regards to his regular customers’ support, owner of Szechuan Delight Tom Chee expresses his deep appreciation. Also, he hopes that more new customers will come and have a try. Furthermore, being a take-out restaurant, Szechuan Delight boasts fast service and speedy delivery. Usually, orders are ready for pickup within 15 minutes. For delivery, Szechuan Delight promises that the delivery will reach the customers within 45 minutes depending on delivery distance. It is often the case that the delivery time is far less than 45 minutes.
Whether seeking convenient take-out or efficient delivery, customers will find Szechuan Delight quite competitive due to its high quality and fair prices, reliable delivery, and hundreds of choices. Trust is the vital factor in business. Looking more to provide delicious food instead of making money, Tom Chee makes his own way to earn the trust of his patrons. Sticking to high quality food and satisfactory service, Tom Chee beats other restaurant owners with his sincerity and focus on really catering to each of his regular patrons. Moreover, word-of-mouth helps to bring in new patrons, which is a pleasing cycle often seen among popular restaurants. As for staff management, he creates an equal and harmonious working environment. Everyone helps each other out when the need arises leading to high morale and a more efficient team. Constantly found helping in the restaurant, Tom Chee is respected by his staff. Just like living with family, his staff enjoys working and interacting with each other at Szechuan Delight.
The success of Szechuan Delight has roots in the owner’s past experiences. Thirty years ago, before coming to the United States, Tom Chee was in Hong Kong working as a chef. After immigrating to America, he found work at restaurants. He has even worked as a chef and a waiter, helping to lay a solid foundation for his opening of Szechuan Delight.

It is a modern day love story set in Pakistan. The show is a love triangle of two boys and one girl. My character is a slightly on the darker side. Shooting for the show with Sanam (Baloch) and Fawad (Khan) was a great experience. It is a great cast. I have known them since a long time. All of us have started our careers roundabout the same time so we have a different level of understanding and friendship.
I think people like to see new faces. There is a novelty factor about the actors. Also, our cultures are quite similar. People can relate to the social issues, which are addressed in our soaps. Moreover, people know what is happening in Pakistan, so there is the general awareness.
I have seen a few of them over the years. Not much of the recent stuff though. If I get a daily soap that has an interesting character and suits me, I would surely take it up. I love the game shows and reality TV in India. I feel they are executed very well. I enjoy all the music-based programmes.
The content on Indian TV is bolder than what we see in Pakistan. Would you be comfortable getting intimate on screen?
Indian media is a way lot bolder. There is a huge difference in the level of acceptance. My primary audience is pretty sensitive about such things. Of course, as actors, we have the liberty but one needs to find a balance.
I like both the mediums. You need to be a little subtle while performing for TV while films allow you the liberty of being larger than life. Both the mediums require different skill sets. It is exciting as an actor.
Pakistani actors like Fawad and Mahira Khan are doing well in Bollywood. Do you guys discuss work in the Hindi film industry?
All of us are in the same age bracket. We started off together Fawad and I. We know each other’s pasts and do discuss work abroad. At times, we have actors’ forums wherein we participate. They are held abroad. There is a lot of unity in the film industry in Pakistan. We are like an extended family.
I am waiting to for something substantial to do in Bollywood. In the mean time, I have been quite busy with my production firm in Pakistan. However, I like to work in India, I love the food and people.
I find that flattering but more me it is important to be known as a man of substance than someone with mere good looks.

Nearly 75% of global respondents, on average, say a brand’s country of origin is as important as or more important than nine other purchasing drivers, including selection/choice, price, function and quality, according to findings from the Nielsen Global Brand-Origin Survey released today. The new research examined whether consumers prefer goods produced by global/multinational brands (defined as those that operate in many markets) or by local players (those operating only in a single market—the respondent’s home country), based on responses from more than 30,000 online respondents in 61 countries spanning 40 categories.
Respondents in Asia-Pacific and Africa/Middle East are likelier to say that origin is more important than the other selection factors (33% and 32% on average, respectively). European, North American and Latin American respondents, in contrast, are likelier to say brand origin is less important than the other selection factors (35%, 32% and 31% on average, respectively).
“One of the more surprising findings from the survey is that country of origin is as important as—or even more important than—other purchasing criteria such as price and quality,” said Patrick Dodd, group president, Nielsen Growth Markets. “In a crowded retail environment, brand origin can be an important differentiator between brands, but sentiment varies by category and by country, and leveraging a powerful brand presence needs to be managed carefully regardless of whether it is global or local. Ultimately, the brands that deliver on a strong value proposition and connect personally to consumers’ needs will have the advantage in any given market.”

Alexa has become obsessed with sorting things. She likes to sort pompoms into cups and Legos into bins. She'll sort spoons or blocks or anything else you give her a few of. I came up with a cool popsicle stick color sorting game for her using a small cardboard box, an Exacto knife, some markers and 8 popsicle sticks.
My original idea was that she could pull the popsicle sticks out of the box and put them back into the slits in the box. This would help her with fine motor skills and also introduce colors and matching at the same time. The idea was a success!
I did have to hold the box down for her so she could remove the sticks and then put them back in the slots. I wish I could figure out a way to weigh down the box so that in the future this can be an independent play activity. I'll have to work on that.
She had no problem pulling the sticks out. I was amazed at how easily she was able to put most of the sticks back into the slots. Her fine motor skills really have improved since we started letting her put money in her bank.
I love this simple activity because it is a progressive learning toy. Right now, she uses it to take the sticks out and put them back in. Next we will start working on color recognition and matching using the box. I can even see a mix and match game with this box in our future.

To have all three Warumpi Band albums combined on one Double CD set is quite a revelation. Warumpi Band 4 Ever brings together Big Name, No Blankets (1985), Go Bush! (1987) and Too Much Humbug (1996) plus the addition of early demos and non-LP singles as bonus tracks. Hearing the transition from the ragged yet authentic roots rock of the debut to the slicker, modern rock sheen of the third album puts the band’s story into sharp focus.
Led by the charismatic yet volatile George Rrurrambu, along with Neil Murray’s song writing skills and Sammy Butcher’s tasteful guitar playing, Warumpi Band was a mixed race band of seemingly disparate elements. Yet the whole was always greater than the sum of its parts. The bottom line is that this was just a classic rock band with a powerful presence and resonating message. The group was such a potent force that none other than Midnight Oil linked up with them to tour remote Aboriginal outback communities. The life-changing Blackfella/Whitefella tour inspired the Oils to write their landmark Diesel and Dust album.
Formed in 1981 at Papunya, a remote Aboriginal community 150 miles west of Alice Springs, the Warumpis started out playing covers of vintage rock ’n’ roll songs before writing original material that reflected their own experiences and celebrated Aboriginal cultural values.
Their 1983, independent debut single, ‘Jailanguru Pakarnu (Out From Jail)’ was the first rock song sung in an Aboriginal dialect (Luritja). Big Name, No Blankets appeared on the Oils’ Powderworks label in April 1985. Grounded in early American R&B and boogie as it was, the album was nevertheless an honest, bare-boned and enduring slice of indigenous country music, or desert rock if you will. Most importantly the songs are brilliant, from the chiming ‘Waru (Fire)’ and the sprightly ‘Breadline’ to the prickly rocker ‘Mulga & Spinifex Plain’ and the epochal ‘Blackfella / Whitefella’.
‘Blackfella / Whitefella’ remains the most engaging song, Rrurrambu’s message as relevant as ever: “Blackfella, whitefella / It doesn’t matter what your colour / As long as you a true fella / As long as you a real fella”.
With the line-up of Murray, Rrurrambu, Kenny Smith (bass) and American Allen Murphy (drums) the Warumpis recorded Go Bush! in late 1986. It’s a tougher sounding work overall (‘No Fear’, ‘Secret War’, ‘From The Bush’) although the archetypal track is the deeply melodic ‘My Island Home’. It features Murray’s lyrics yet it’s Rrurrambu’s own story and he delivers the words in a truly spectacular manner. Christine Anu later won an APRA Song of the Year Award (1995) for her version of the song.
Murray left at the end of 1988 to pursue a solo career which effectively meant the end of the Warumpi Band. Nevertheless, they reunited in 1995 for a successful European tour and new album Too Much Humbug (April 1996). It boasted slicker production values, courtesy of producer Mark Ovendon (You Am I, Yothu Yindi). Standouts are ‘Wayathul’ (epic and expansive), ‘Djulpan’ (sparse and twangy), ‘Stompin’ Ground’ (sinewy and hard rocking) and ‘Holdin’ You In My Arms’ (sweetened by the voices of Amy Saunders and Sally Dastey from Tiddas).
Rounding out the set are the non-LP singles ‘Sitdown Money’ and the aforementioned ‘Jailanguru Pakarnu (Out From Jail)’, plus the four tracks that made up their first cassette release from 1983. While covers of ‘Route 66’, ‘It’s All Over Now’ and ‘Promised Land’ are perfunctory, it’s the self-referring ‘Warumpi Rock’ that points the way forward. George passed away in June 2007.

Global Transnet UK is a company established in London in February 2015. GTUK works in collaboration with Sky Way Technologies. GTUK main goal is to work on projects implementing the string technology as a new transportation system.
Our mission is to build new revolutionary infrastructure. We believe that transportation is a huge part of our daily lives and this project can offer faster and more enjoyable journey for every country, every city and for the humanity all together without damaging soil and spending enormous amounts of capital.
Our vision is to implement a new innovative transportation system able to solve the major global issues, such as overpopulation, pollution, road accidents and land use.
String technology is aiming to create global transportation without harming lands and damaging soil. GTUK as a company is planning to share this vision globally and implement 100 000 km of string roads in the next 10 years. We already have contracts in place for 160 000km to this day and we are looking for more people and countries to share our vision with. Our main goal is to continue the import, export and travel in general without economy disruption. The most important aspect is to create a new and ecological market for transportation.
Global Transnet UK was founded in early 2015 after extensive research of the Sky Way technology and successful cooperation with the financial arm for the project Sky Way Invest Group.
Co-founders, Armand Murnieks and Andrey Khovratov were very impressed by Sky Way’s revolutionary approach to rail, and they immediately wanted to see Sky Way systems built both in UK and globally.
They co-own the British company (GTUK) with Dr Anatoly Yunitskiy the inventor of Sky Way technology, and SWIG leading Financiers.
highly respected engineer with a PhD in Civil and Transport Engineering is the brainchild and driving force behind Sky Way and its major engineering and technical advancements
An academician of the State Corporation for Space Activities (Federation of Cosmonautics of the USSR) and has received many commendations and awards for his entrepreneurial work in the transport sector.

The teen years seem wrought with comparison. Going along with the crowd. Not wanting to stick out or be different.
Um, or maybe that's the adult years? I get them confused. Because it's hard when you are the last to get married. Or to have a baby. Or you consider the glamorous lives of others and it makes your life seem so dull.
Perhaps its group fitness activities, oh say, like an early morning boot camp, when you realize that you can't do the same number of burpees as the girls next to you.
We seem to spend our lives sitting at our desks with our eyes wandering to the paper of our neighbors. I can nearly hear the voice of certain teachers from my past screeching, "Eyes on your own paper!"
This whole bent of our human nature is only fueled with the fires of social media and modern technology. Where, at a moment's notice, we realize that so-and-so is on some fabulous vacation while we are cleaning up dog throw up. Or, those other moms planned some amazing Easter activities and family fun. While we went to worship and came home and did a whole lotta nada the rest of the day. Oh and wait a minute...those pins on Pinterest tell me that a friend is planning and plotting something big while I am just hoping to get to Friday.
Yep. We expend a great deal of energy considering what others are up to. Measuring sticks and plumb lines set through instant information. It can leave us feeling that our lives and our plans pale in comparison.
I read THIS during my Bible reading this morning. And, oh, the freedom this truth has to offer for each of us.
This is part of Jesus' prayer in the garden, just before He is arrested. He is telling His Father that He brought glory to God by completing the work that HE was given to do. Not the work for John the Baptist or the tasks the multitudes hoped for in wishing for a military king who would conquer their enemies.
Nope. The hard work of listening intently to His father's call and staying so close to Him that He spoke His Father's words. Obeying His Father's leading. Even to the point of surrendering his own life in a horrific death.
In other words, we bring glory to our Father by completing the work that HE gives US to do. We all have our own unique task lists. Yet, we can get so caught up in looking at others' papers. Then we either don't complete our own work or we miss the joy in doing so.
Listen, if you are married, then part of the work you were given by your Father is be the spouse that your partner needs. To love and cherish and support and serve them and affirm them on their own journey of faith. If you are a mom, by birth or adoption or fostering, then the work He gave YOU to do is to care for those children.
Yes, dear bloggy mom friends. Your work on earth is indeed filling up sippy cups, wiping little bums, answering a zillion questions, cleaning up baby puke, and collapsing from the fatigue of the mundane. It may not be glamorous, but it's the work He gave you on earth.
I was just emailing with a friend this morning about the upcoming Swap and Shop. She was offering kind words about how she could never organize such an event.
Um, HELLO! She is a very talented singer and actress who offers her gifts and time at church and community theater. I could never do THAT.
But it's the perfect example of embracing our own work and doing it well. It's the work our Father gave US and we bring Him glory when we just do it. Whether that means traveling the globe to sing or act or speak or care for orphans. Or never leaving your home state and being willing to do the little things.
My husband's Mamaw was such a beautiful example of this Scripture--this call to do the work we are given to do. Head to the plow, full steam ahead.
She helped her parents on their farm while growing up. She cared for her siblings and helped her mom run the household. She graduated valedictorian of her class of 17 seniors at Ponder High School. She worked hard as a telephone operator. Married the love of her life and waited patiently as he served in World War II. Tried for years to have babies, enduring multiple miscarriages. Tried to adopt, and then got pregnant. Denied the twins that were to be hers when she notified the adoption agency of her pregnancy. Cared for and prayed for her baby girl who was born needing a risky surgery she may not survive. Poured herself into mothering her daughter and helping raise her nieces when they needed her help, living with her for months at a time. Took in and cared for aging parents and in-laws in her 800 square foot home. Loved her grandson and poured herself into his care as needed. Served at church. Woke up at 4:00 am to fix a hot breakfast for her husband before his early morning factory shift. Worked. And worked. And worked. With love and grace and without complaint.
She was not famous. She was not rich. But, she found joy in completing the work that she was given. And that set her apart. That made her amazing. That brought glory to God.
Herein lies our challenge. To stop and consider what work we've been given. Here's some clues to uncover your assigned work. Who has God placed in your life? And how can you love and serve them? What dreams and hopes and plans do we have? Ask God to show us which of those translate to the work He has for us? What gifts and talents and passions do you have? Pray about how to channel them, according to His leading. Then, just jump off the boat and do it.
Most importantly--learn to free yourself from the trap of comparison. Consider where and how you get messages that make you feel defeated or less than. Cut these things out! That may mean deleting the Facebook app from your phone. Or avoiding Pinterest. Or avoiding certain television shows or books or magazines. Instead, dive into the truth of His Word and spend time in prayer to ask Him about the work He has for YOU. Ask the Holy Spirit to encourage you as you seek to complete God's assigned workload so that you bring HIM glory.
We all have our very own race to run. Our path will not look like that of others. Neither will our pace. Chances are, the work you are given on earth will be hard and tedious and mundane much of the time. But this does not diminish the fact that this work is indeed glory work.
Glory work. Pointing others toward your Father. It has eternal value. Diving into your own task list, your own talents, your own calling. And doing it to completion. To bring Him glory and thus point others to Him. Keeping your eyes on your own paper. Ignoring the crowd or trends or the culture.
Just running, with all your might, the pathway He has for you. Remembering that completing the work He gives you in each day is indeed, glory work.
I see you. I see you hanging there. Well, you're kinda hard to miss, all bright red and such, hanging there in my craft room closet....

Interested in writing, Japan, personality theory, Disney, anime, or completed randomness? You've come to the right place!
In all the contemporary YA I've written, sex comes up. It's actually a major premise and a theme in MS1 and MS5. (Oh my gosh, I sound so cool with 5 WIPs! WOOT!) Why do I make sex take a front seat in my YA, especially when it's such a hot topic, and often controversial for conservative watchdogs?
Even where it's not overt- think about how many things tie in sexiness when that really has nothing to do with it. How many times have you seen cars, beers, food, etc advertised using beautiful women in suggestive clothing?
Alright then, let's talk about sex, baby. Here are some reasons I think sex is always relevant in YA.
(Listen to what the say at the beginning. So appropriate for the sex in YA discussion. And there's the rap in the middle about STDs. Maybe they should make all parents and teens watch this vid! lol)
Some adults file their sexuality away in a closet. But that's so much harder to do as a teen with hormones spilling out your eyeballs. (Seriously glad I wasn't a boy, so I never had to deal with inappropriate rushes of blood to inappropriate areas of my body.) With the raging hormones, situations escalate quickly. A simple brush of fingers and your blood temperature is through the roof.
Everybody's talking the talk. Even if their friends are all virgins, they're theorising about it. And sex makes its way into even casual conversation. People are boasting about all sorts of things.
All this talk (and the fact that sex is all over the other entertainment media) naturally leads to sex taking up space in your imagination. What's it really like?
A signficant other or close friend might actively put pressure on a teen. And even if noone purposely tries to convince them, the pressure of just knowing that all their friends have "crossed that finish line", can make a teen feel like they should too.
Whether or not to have sex is probably one of the biggest, most agonising decision a lot of teens face. If you choose not to have sex, then that's something that defines you and plays a role in your life.
And of course, there's the Judy Bloom-esque concept of two teens deeply in love and just wanting to take their relationship to another level.
At the end of mandatory schooling (16 in Bim), I was a virgin. I can't say if that's rare for Barbados or not. I think we're a little freer with our sexual ideals, living somewhere at the intersection of African culture, remnants of slave days, and Christianty. Among my friends, however, it wasn't the norm.
Despite the fact that I was a virgin, I had a HORRIBLE reputation. It's all very explainable. When I was 13, I had a completely innocent non-sexual relationship with an older teenager. One day we were walking somewhere and a classmate saw us. Out of nowhere, I'm the subject of all these rumours. The weird thing is that I was just walking down a road, not even holding hands, with this guy and 2 of his friends and 1 of mine. And somehow, people got images of inappropriacy from it. It was like a scene straight out of the 16th century. (Good thing we didn't do SCARLET LETTER in English Lit!)
For the rest of my school life, and even after, these sexual rumours coloured my life. It went through a few stages. First there was rampant denial. Then there was amusement at seeing what rumours people could come up with. Eventually, I got jaded enough that I stopped caring about my reputation at all. If people are going to say you did something, why bother to SEEM like you're not doing it? And furthermore, why bother NOT doing it?
From my experience, whatever a teen's stance on sex, they come into contact with it. In my personal life, sex haunted me for YEARS before I even went near it. YEARS! Sex shaped my teenage years. Having to live through that reputation and still hold my head high, give me a strength I still need in the face of detractors sometimes.
Still, it's important to consider how you represent sex in YA. As a teen, there's so much misinformation. If you're writing YA, you have an opportunity to show sex in a beautiful pure light, as the dark issue that it can be, or just matter-of-factly. The only thing you need to be careful about is not to be preachy.
I won't support any argument that says universally that sex is not a concern and shouldn't be in YA. If it's an issue you find even moderately common in secondary and high schools around the world, then it's an issue that belongs in our books.
(Just in case you wondered, this concern doesn't seem to exist in Japan. Sex outside of marriage/as a teen isn't really frowned upon. I wonder if sex isn't something that Buddhism and Shinto speak to. Even if it is, Japanese people are a lot more lax in practising religion. Children outside of marriage are really frowned upon though, so in the event of unplanned pregnancy, people either get married, or abort. And when you couple that with how uncommon oral contraceptives are the abortion rates are higher. There's no shame or moral dilemma to abortion either. It's just a fact of life.
Needless to say, sex is pretty much a given in Japanese high school romances, and possible in real ife Japanese high school.)
Sex is a natural part of life. So is being naked. Everyone is naked at least some of the time. However most of this is not shown in YA.
What is show is violence. Violence is not a natural part of the world. I don't go down the street and see beheadings, torture, beatings, etc. Yet this is somehow what writers find acceptable and is considered okay.
So my point is, why is nudity, sex, and issues dealing with sex which comes NATURALLY avoided when violence which comes UNNATURALLY is celebrated?
Seriously glad I wasn't a boy, so I never had to deal with inappropriate rushes of blood to inappropriate areas of my body.
HAHA, couldn't agree more :D anyway, great post! i'm writing a book in which religion and sex both have a huge role, so reading this post was real helpful :)

A few weekends ago I wasn't feeling very "sewy" but I wanted to do something that would give me a sense of accomplishment. Mostly because I'd created yet another hideous garment. (No. You can't see it. It's hideousness would burn the very eyes from your heads. Really. I'm thinking of calling in an exorcist next week.) Anyway, my point is that I needed to do something that would result in an actual sense of achievement (instead of needing holy water and a priest).
I have been downright hoarding patterns. I'll admit it. I started sewing clothes about six or seven years ago and I have never, ever, no not ever once thrown away a pattern I've purchased. Literally. I have four or five patterns that I bought over 20 years ago in a mad fit of considering garment sewing and I even still had those. (I recovered from the mad fit pretty quickly and went back to quilting until after the Evil Monkeys were born.)
But for the past two-three (even four) years I really haven't sewn much for myself. And what I have sewn has been mostly from basic patterns or from my personal sloper. The large bulk of the patterns in the hoard are either untouched or disasters. Or both.
My only excuse has to be mental deficiency brought on by the lingering effects of multiple pregnancies. Er... which is pretty much my excuse for anything that happened for the first six years of the Evil Monkeys' lives. But now I've hit the magical Year Seven Return To Normal Hormones and really... there is just no rational excuse for owning these:
Yes. Those are two different copies of the exact same pattern. Apparently I didn’t think I could figure it out from the first one? Clearly dark forces were at work here, people.
But I am brave! The evil pattern demons can’t bring me down! So I bucked up my courage, dove into the battle and dug through all the pattern boxes. And ended up culling out 100 patterns. Well, 97. Whatever. These are bundles of ten patterns each:
That's a lot of patterns, people. I really didn't expect to get rid of that many. But I've come to the conclusion that between my five years of BWOF back-issues and my current Ottobre subscription... I really don't need any other patterns. Ottobre more than covers all my kids' sewing needs and Ottobre Woman really covers all of mine. Ottobre is certainly easier to deal with and better designed than the Big4 generally are. Plus, quite a few of these patterns are simply the wrong size range for me and there’s not really any point in holding on to those. (I have no idea why I own so many patterns in size 20-28. I currently cut a size 12-14. The mind boggles at what I might have been thinking.)
I did keep some patterns. Mostly Big4 that are still in the Evil Monkeys' size ranges and any independents that might be useful or that I just enjoy owning. I have a ridiculous collection of HotPatterns and vintage Folkwear, for instance. Because I will persist in the delusion that I might have lost 45 pounds when I wake up tomorrow.
This post is hilarious! And I can see some good in the Very Easy Vogue 7941. Something tells me I own that pattern!
LOL! I feel your pain. I seem to be unable to give away patterns too--even the ones that are the wrong size! Congratulations on the pattern cull, may I have the courage to follow in your footsteps! :-)
That is a fabulous collection, and I applaud you for actually culling it! I cannot get rid of any of my patterns - I'm a hoarder and I'm not sorry :)
It is a good feeling to have a clean house and clear mind after getting rid of things that you don't love anymore! Happy for you!
I don't have all these loose patterns because they are not available to buy here, only online, but I have a lot of sewing magazines. And I'm actually starting NOT buying EVERY sewing magazine that I CAN buy! I have progress also!
phfft! only 5 years of BWOF? Try every edition since November 1992. ... and then there's the big4 in the big box. plus the weird randoms that are shoved in the cupboard. Oh dear, I do have a problem
I started sewing a few years ago to make myself some clothes, and now I mostly quilt. This does not stop me from continuing to buy many, many more garment patterns than I will ever use.
So, you've got yer stacks of ten, lemme ask you this, are those stacks STILL IN YOUR POSSESSION? And yes, a bin in the garage counts as possession.
Also, holy crap, woman! I have nowhere near 100 patterns in my collection, much less 97 to cull! Of course, there are no $1 sales going down anywhere near my current location....
2014 has been a fun yet emotional parenthood ride for me. There have been many firsts and many big decisions amongst which was to enroll her into Primary school for formal education. The kiddo is growing up fast and like all parents, I get sappy when I look at her milestones which remind me that she is growing way too fast.
While her friends cut their first tooth at 7-9 months old, Dumpling cut hers at 11months old so I naturally thought that she will not drop her first tooth until much later, having seen friends’ sharing on Facebook on how their children are dropping their baby teeth. Or so I thought.
Lo and behold, she excitedly screamed to me, one evening, not too many weeks back that her bottom incisor was a bit wobbly. And I was going “oh dear, not so fast!” But of course, she was right, her tooth became more and more wobbly over the next few days with her asking us repeatedly when her tooth would drop. And it finally did, one and a half weeks later when she first discovered her tooth was wobbly.
Frankly, I died a little inside, but at moments like these, what’s a parent ‘gonna’ do except to paste a smile on my face and preserve this momentous milestone, the best that I can.
We were gifted with this kit last year at Dumpling's BD party and my first thought then was that it was really pretty and really cute!
- A small Tooth / Coin Pouch (for the kiddo to place her tooth inside and for the 'Tooth Fairy' to place a coin in it)
- A baby tooth album which comes as a flapbook and has a baby tooth chart (to chart the momentous date of course!)
The really cool thing is that the album has slots for specific tooth - in our case, it was the bottom right front incisor and this was 'labelled' by way of drawing above the slots too
Besides being able to record the dates, the chart also has information on the approximate 'shedding' date.
She also made sure that she hung the Door Hanger on the bedroom door so no one misses out on her tooth... Best of all, it comes in pink AND blue making it a perfect gift!

The sweetest memory I have when my children are growing up is seeing them reach every important milestone in their infancy stage... From their first chuckles, to their first crawl, to their first unaided walk on two legs.
The sweetest memory that I have when my children growing up is to see them from a small baby to now being able to complete simple task on their own and to be able to communicate with me.
My sweetest memory was the first day that I saw her in her 'birthday suit' at the delivery ward. Fiona
My fondest memories of my kids growing up is when they first learn to call papa & mama and the babbles that are absolutely cute!
Every of their 'firsts' is sweet to me. Like you, my eldest son (in P1) just drop his first lower central insicor tooth a few weeks ago. My hubby and I are both very excited because this is the ultimate sign of our son becoming a big kid.:-)
So many sweetest moments! I have to say the first time when he made a bracelet as a Mother's Day gift for me.
My sweetest memory was my girl's sweetest smile whenever she is happy and bring tears to me whenever she is upset.
Thank you very much for this giveaway!!! My elder son has started dropping his milk teeth and I am keeping his dropped milk teeth in zip-lock bag only :( Hope to win this so that I can keep them properly and pass it to him eventually!
Our latest, most exciting memory happened just last Monday. We were waiting for the school gate to open when my son laugh with such a big mouth with me, that I saw 2 tinee cuties peeking at me. 2 new permanent teeth have erupted with no other signs, the babies weren't even shaky. It was a test of patience for me when the gates open just at that moment and teachers motion for us to go in. I just could not contained my excitement and share the news with all the teachers I met that day. I had to wait 5 whole hours for my son to return from his school trip before I could admire them properly! That night, we had a long bedtime chat. Instead of having the usual reading of bedtime stories, we made up our own by giving the 2 newbies name: Pinky and Ponky. Their babies were named: Blastar and Blisty respectively. It took us another 19 hours or so of wait for our earliest dental appointment possible. In the meanwhile, I made my son open his mouth every now and then. =P. Glad to say, he now as a habit of going the the mirror to check on Pinky and Ponky like a new Papa telling me how many nano meters they have grown since he last check. Blasty and Blastar are expected to make way within these 2 weeks. Oh gosh, that kit would be so useful for us to record down our memory! Hmm.....I wonder if Pinky and Ponky are going the be sweet-tooth?
My sweetest memory of my little one was when I accidentally hurt myself once and he immediately ran over to me to check on me. When I told him what happened, he gave me a big hug and kissed my hand where I'd burned myself. He was barely 2 and hadn't started talking yet but his action transcended his inability to verbalise at that point. I still get all warm amd fuzzy inside recalling that moment.
Oh! I love this Tooth Fairy Kit! I have to say I love to record every sweetest moments for my 2 princesses. I still can remember when my eldest girl first tooth came out at 7/12/2006 and her first tooth dropped on 26/2/2012. I love to record every sweetest moments for both of them. Hope I can win this Tooth Fairy Kit for my younger daughter.
My sweetest moment is when my first born goes to Primary 1. He buys me a garlic bread using his pocket money.
The sweetest memory was on the morning of my birthday, then my 2.5 yo suddenly sang happy birthday song to me when i was changing his diaper. I asked everyone, no one taught him and i dunno how come he did that, but is truly the most touching bdae ever.

Having decided that their next single would be the double a-side Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane, The Beatles took part in promotional films. Work began on this day in Knole Park in Sevenoaks, Kent.
The films were both produced by Tony Bramwell for Subafilms, and were shot on colour 35mm film by a crew from London-based Don Long Productions. The Swedish director was Peter Goldmann, who had been recommended by Klaus Voormann.
Goldmann had arrived in England in early January and looked for suitable locations in London and elsewhere. The first location he decided upon was Knole Park, owned by the National Trust.
On this evening filming began on Strawberry Fields Forever. A number of sequences were shot around a dead oak tree near the park's birdhouse. The tree is no longer there.
A rough mono mix of A Day In The Life was made in the control room of Studio Three on this day. It was for demo purposes and wasn't intended for release, as recording wasn't yet complete on the song.
The Beatles were not present for the session, which began at 7pm and finished at 8.30pm. They were at Knole Park in Sevenoaks, Kent, to make promotional films for Strawberry Fields Forever and Penny Lane.

I got a question about inductive types, I thought all sub function types need to end with the inductive type. But I got a inductive type that im not sure how it works 11/01 18:17
in general the “sub function types” must indeed end with the inductive types — or better, the constructors must indeed construct the inductive, but that’s tested after normalization 11/01 19:14
Nik05: you should check where `\in` is defined to confirm what I’m saying, though my guess is very reasonable 11/01 19:15
sets can be seen as predicates (the characteristic function of the set), and then `s \in S` (element `s` belongs to set `S`) becomes `S s` (element `s` satisfies predicate `S`) 11/01 19:16
Nik05: after seeing the definition, can you follow my reasoning? Where do you have questions? 11/01 19:17
so X in P A indeed reduces to P A X, but shouldnt the function and in P A and not in P A X? 11/01 19:19
pgiarrusso: sorry but my inductive type is P : A -> S (S U). But the last type is P A X : S U 11/01 21:30
Nik05`: generally, the typechecker must run definitions before comparing types, and you must do the same (as we’ve done) to follow what it does 11/01 21:57
I still don't see how it matches. P A has type S (S U) = (U -> Set) -> Set. P A X has type Set 11/01 22:03
Random thoughts on the theme of age (and its differences) by someone who is approaching the upper reaches of the range and tends to spend odd moments contemplating past experience
So Saturday was not too good a day because of the weather limiting what I was able to do; especially on the allotment. However it did enable me to clear up some jobs around the house that I have been putting of for some time now and Mrs DeeJay was glad for that.
It also enabled me to make a serious start on tracing my family history. I managed to find a great deal on both sides of my family where there are some extended local connections. Unfortunately I have been set a problem to solve with my paternal grandfather, who I never knew. When he married my grandmother he was in the armed forces and was not a ‘local boy’. I know his birth year, from his marriage certificate to my grandmother, but do not know the exact date or where he came from originally so I nee to get sleuthing but there are really not too many left of the generation that might have some clues.
Sunday was allotment day. Not a great idea as I returned to my gym weights routine on Saturday after several weeks layoff and then went to my Spinning class on Sunday morning – ouch!
However I managed several hours and made some good progress but as you can see there is still more left to do than I have already done!
The other good thing about digging, in solitude except for the birds singing and my friendly robin coming down to my feet to see if I was digging up any grubs for him, was the time I had to think. I have been getting pretty depressed by a few things recently and this time alone in some nice weather allowed me to start getting some of them into perspective.
The weather was great on Saturday and the ground has started to dry out – at least on the surface. It was still pretty wet underneath in parts – yep you got it - the part I wanted to clear for the potatoes!
Well I managed about half of what I intended to do, but the heavy soil and the call of the golf course was just too much. The good news is that the long winter lay off from golf has certainly done me some good. I played the back 9 this week and scored spot on my 25 club handicap.
I then spent an hour spinning in the gym this morning and we had a stand-in instructor who really punished us with a strange routine.
Then there was cleaning the bike. OMG how dirty was that? I didn’t realise that so little use through the winter could result in so much grime. But still never mind it truly gleams now after I spent 2 whole hours on it.
I have just got tickets for Joan Armatrading and also for Gary Moore. Furtheron has got tickets for The Police and I know is alo going to see Gary Moore.
Talking of music last night Mrs DeeJay and I were discussing Sylvia by Dr Hook that was playing on the radio when the lyric
We then digressed on things telecommunications and got to talking about our English old style phone boxes and the "Press button A or button B" types from the 1960s.
They are so cute and cuddly. Why is it that at a few hours to a few days old, they don't mind humans, but as soon as they get a bit bigger they are so timid?
Apologies to all you vegetarians out there but perhaps their timidity is because they know that we left our phone number to be contacted in a few weeks time for delivery of a lamb - and no of course we won't be cuddling it, we will be making sure that we have plenty of room free in the freezer before then.
Maybe its just the weather, but even so, it is the weather that is allowing me to do stuff that is making me feel good.
So far today, I have pruned my roses, cut back my berberis bushes in a BIG way (they were getting far to tall and ungainly I will try to post some pics later.
Not exactly topiary I know but if you had seen the mess they were in before you would understand my pride.
And to cap it all I just went to the golf course for the first time since last October and did 9 holes in 46!!!
Not really sure what use this will be to me, nor do I know how many different colours there are, but what the hell!
You tend to spend a lot of time thinking about esoteric subjects, the meaning of life, and pop culture.
For my U.S. readers, an allotment is a pretty quaint old English (although not entirely) custom where we cultivate vegetable patched that are not part of our own land or garden but are usually rented from the local authority (Parish Council in my case) for a ludicrously low rent. Mine is £5 p.a.!!!
I have already bought my seed potatoes and they are already ‘chitting’ so I need to get the ground prepared in the next couple of weeks.
I have also started raising my broad beans in the greenhouse ready to transplant in about a month’s time.
However all forecasts for reasonable Saturday weather were not any good to me as when I got there, with thermos flask of tea, my iPod and LOADS of good intentions, all I found was a waterlogged allotment.
My own patch, although not as bad as my neighbour's, was wet enough to render any attempts to dig it over and removing the winter's crop of weeds, nigh on impossible.
The ground was so heavy that all it did was stick to the spade and fork, to say nothing of the soles of my boots so that within half an hour I was standing some 8 or 9 inches taller!
Today’s weather is worse with rain right from the start so I am going to have to pray for some dry stuff over the next week or so and then have to embark on a marathon dig (oh my poor back!) to get it all ready for planting instead of being able to do the planned preparation over a number of the coming weekends.

New research has unveiled that breast cancers produce proteins very similar to those made by the virus that causes yellow fever. Since vaccines have been created to prevent yellow fever, there is a potential that the vaccine could also be used to prevent breast cancer.
Scientists have been trying to find ways to develop vaccines to target potential cancer cells for years. However, only a handful have been successfully implemented, such as the vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV), which helps prevent HPV infections that cause cervical and head and neck cancers1. Few other cancer types are caused by viruses, making them difficult to target with vaccines2.
Vaccines introduce a small amount of a virus into your system – not enough to cause symptoms, but enough to make your immune cells familiar with foreign particles3. In response, the body develops an army of immune cells that are specifically designed to target that virus. After immunization, the presence of any viral particles in the body will lead to the mobilization of the targeted immune cell army and destruction of the virus before infection sets in3.
A study published in the European Journal of Cancer Prevention showed that the yellow fever vaccine may be linked to a decrease in breast cancer risk in women aged 40-544. Researchers in Veneto, Italy looked back at medical records of women who received the yellow fever vaccine and looked for breast cancer diagnoses after vaccination. Among 12,804 women who received the vaccination, 187 cases of breast cancer were found. Women who received the vaccine between the ages of 40 and 54 experienced the greatest decrease in breast cancer risk with a 54% reduction in breast cancer incidence following administration of the yellow fever vaccine4. The researchers therefore proposed that the vaccine could help protect against breast cancer.
Breast cancer itself has not been linked to viral infection. However, breast cancers produce human endogenous retroviral (HERV) proteins that closely resemble the proteins produced by yellow fever. Other cancers including melanoma, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer have also been shown to express these HERV proteins5. HERVs are remnants of ancestral infections that have become incorporated in our DNA and passed down through several generations. They have been maintained as part of our cells because they serve some function that is beneficial to human physiology. Approximately 8% of our DNA can be traced back to HERVs5.
The yellow fever vaccine was first developed in 1937 to target the yellow fever virus, which causes liver dysfunction and yellowing of the skin (hence the term yellow fever)3. When vaccinated, the body develops an army of immune cells called T cells to target the yellow fever virus. Because of the similarities between yellow fever and the HERVs produced in breast cancer, the army of T cells will also recognize and destroy any HERV-producing breast cancer cells3. Think of it in terms of languages. The T cells have been trained to understand English, a language that is spoken by both the yellow fever virus (with an American accent) and the breast cancer HERVs (with an Australian accent). Regardless of the accent, the T cells will still be able to recognize and understand both types of proteins. This is called “cross-reactivity”. However, if the T cells meet another type of virus speaking a different language, for example HPV speaking French, the T cells will not be able to understand or act on the signals from that virus.
While the findings in this study are interesting, a vaccine for breast cancer is still far from reality. More active studies are necessary in order to establish the relationship between breast cancer and the vaccine for yellow fever as well as to determine the mechanism by which this vaccine affects breast cancer risk. This could be in the form of a clinical trial, with some women receiving the vaccine and others receiving a placebo4. If the relationship is real, it would be very easy to implement this vaccine because it is already mass-produced and has been administered more than 540 million times4. This finding is therefore an exciting step forward in the world of cancer vaccines.

Unlike their counterparts of the past years, today’s ladies of senior age want more out of life and are seeking men who are younger to get further fulfillment in many aspects of their lives. However, not every young man will qualify as a partner for this kind of lady. There are always reasons why these older women get attracted to younger men. Some of the things that attract them are as follows:-
Compared to their older counterparts, younger men seem to take better care of themselves and happen to look very attractive physically. Most of them will spend some time exercising to keep their bodies in shape or build some muscle which the old girls will find very attractive. Most of the men are also keeping up with current fashion trends and therefore what they lack in terms of natural looks, they can make up for by being fashionable. will be attracted by the physical look because it is what they see first. If they love what they are seeing, often times they will go after it or make themselves readily available.
Most grannies are normally at the peak of their sexual lives. Most of them find themselves wanting to have sex more often, something that men of their age cannot keep up with. Men at the prime of their youth are often energetic and are therefore able to meet the sexual needs of these ladies without breaking sweat. The women therefore find most of them to be the best sexual partners.
In most cases these senior ladies are the ones wearing the pants whenever they are in a relationship with a younger man. They of course love the fact that they are in control and dictate the rules. However, that is rarely the case whenever they are dating or in a relationship with men older than themselves or their age mates. This is why most of them prefer men much younger than themselves, because most of them can be controlled in many ways. Out of this quality particularly came the term cougar dating and its worldwide popularity. From the USA to Australia, dating a cougar has become wildly popular. Even in Europe, younger men dating older women has gained great popularity. Even the uniquely British take on this, called granny or gilf dating has taken off in Australia as well.
For most young men, the world is a wonderful place and everything is done with passion. These old girls find this attractive because the eagerness with which these men do things reminds them of their younger days and even makes them feel younger. As they indulge in the worldly passions with the men, whether music, travel, or even intimacy, they feel as if they are rediscovering the world anew.
Some young men crave knowledge in many aspects of life and feel that under the tutelage of an aged lady, they will know all there is know about several things about life, both in and out of the bedroom. Though not all, many women of senior age are willing to share some useful information or tactics will find the thirst for knowledge in a younger man very attractive and therefore become more than willing to avail themselves as tutor and lover at the same time. With the mothering instinct in most of them, they therefore turn out to be very efficient tutors and convert these knowledge-starved young lads with no experience into sophisticated individuals who can hold their own in society.
The above are simply some of the things that most women of senior age find attractive in men that are still in their youth. Want to read more? Check out this interesting article.
If you’re looking through this site, you probably want to know a little about me and why I’ve chosen to write a blog about granny dating. It all started a few days before my 50th birthday when I attended the wedding of a friend. My divorce had gone through a couple of months earlier and I was still feeling sorry for myself – until the best man who was exactly half my age started chatting me up! I didn’t take him seriously at first – how could I – but I soon realised he was serious and the following week, we went out on a date. From that moment on, I was hooked......
