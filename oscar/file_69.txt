According to the Montevideo Convention, in order to be considered a state, you must have the capacity to enter into relations with the other states.
Originally Live Nations was started in order to help diplomatically active nations and micronations meet the Montevideo Convention requirement. Nations that are members of Live Nations have to provide detailed, no nonsense information about their nation, the nation's incorporations, and must also show periodic evidence that they are still active.
Today Live Nations membership seekers must provide evidence of meaningful international recognition, realism (several active incorporations or agencies), and complexity.
There is only one nation thus far which qualifies for Live Nations membership, due to its international recognition, realism, and complexity. That nation is the United Micronations Multi-Oceanic Archipelago (UMMOA).
However, Live Nations membership is open to any nation with a similar level of recognition, realism, and complexity.
At PVCC, Elders serve two-year terms starting July 1. If re-nominated and approved by the other Elders, he may serve additional terms.
Currently, we have 6 Elders, not counting Pastor Ben. While Rick Aton, Terry Blaker, John Britting, and Carl Pafford are all in the middle of their terms, the terms of Craig Hunter and Joshua Walker are expiring. They are eligible for re-nomination. (Pastor Ben serves as a permanent, non-voting, ex-officio Elder.)
Each spring, we welcome nominations of other men who may wish to be Elders. God has ordained in the scriptures that mature, Godly men be examined and tested before being placed in a position of responsibility.
Please use the form on this page to make a nomination. Please read and consider the relevant scriptures on this topic (Acts 6, 1 Timothy 3, Titus 1, and 1 Peter 5).
Because we want men that God is already using in this church. Elders don’t come from the back benches; Elders serve on the front lines! When nominees are being evaluated for the Eldership, it is their current work and service that will speak most clearly about their suitability: “by their fruits you will know them”.
i have successfully runing OO in Docker on Nextcloud with http. Now i tried to setup more secure with ssl / https. I have run nc as https://cloud.domain.tld, the cert came from lets encrypt, the oo documentserver is reachable over http://domain.tld:8888. Actual i cant edit documents in nc "oo not reached", i think because of https and http problem. So i dont know how exactly setup this as https for oo document server. i read the howto on github for selfsigned cert, but it didnt help me much. Perhaps someone can help.
actuall i only read the document to understand the next steps to do. So situation is working NC with https on subdomain e.g. cloud.domain.tld over Lets Encrypt. Installed OO Document Server via Docker Container. Docker and Container are running. App in NC is installed. So my problem with understanding is - how to get the which cert into OO? Next i think i have to start OO in docker with parameter for DATA Dir: -v /app/onlyoffice/DocumentServer/data:/var/www/onlyoffice/Data. Can i take the lets encrypt .key und .cert from domain.tld and copy them into the data folder, or how to proceed?
yes thats the howto i talk about. But which one? This from the domain.tld? And redirect port like this 8888:443 ?
- i copied the org .crt, .key and .pem files to the folder, but names from domain and nocht like the howto said as onlyoffice... named.
- i works - i copied keys from letsencrypt domain.tld and have to rename them. BUT first i want to use the symlink from live folder, but i notice that docker cant handle these symlinks. These symlinks usefull since they files changing frequently and i now have only a copy of the actual files. So please give me a info about that. thx
I love that we have a growing Amish community in central Hastings County! Since 2000, a number of Amish families have bought farms in Centre Hastings and Stirling-Rawdon. They farm using horses, have set up sawmills and are making furniture. They sell eggs, vegetables, candies and home baking from their farm gates. Look for the signs in Stirling-Rawdon and in Centre Hastings and also you'll notice the highway signs alerting motorists that horsedrawn wagons and buggies might be traveling the sho… Read moreulders.
Many of the Amish speak English but Pennsylvania Deutsch (a form of German) remains an important part of the culture.
There are now around 200,000 Amish is Canada and the US and virtually none in Europe. We are lucky to have families here in Ontario's Highlands!

Really enlightening video from Jordan Peterson on seeing Truth in every story, respecting the dangerous person within, and finding your strength.
Really interesting video from a really interesting YouTube channel. Incredibly far-out stuff, but I think he’s onto something.
I call it the LIWS (loose) method: Label, Imprint, Wipe, Stack – It’s like “painting by number”, but the opposite… I did this when I was bored the other day, and found it helped me out a great deal with my ability to solve 3x2x1 math problems in my head. What’s cooler is that I’m certain it will help lots of people do lots of different kind of mental math more effectively.
The idea behind this (and a LOT of work I’m doing right now) is that we have multiple senses, and if we used them together in new, creative ways, we can enhance our ability to do all kinds of mental work. I initially wanted to come up with something like this after reading about Daniel Tammet. Daniel has synesthesia, which causes him to “experience”, “perceive”, or “sense” numbers as colorful landscapes and graphic images in his mind. When solving complex equations, the landscapes combine to produce the answer, in the form of a rich and complex visual image in his mind’s eye.
I thought, “hey, if it works for him, why not see if it can work to some small extent for the rest of us?” I was never great at math in school, but as I’ve gotten older, I realize that I just never learned it in a way I could really relate with – a way that uses my own mental resources the most effective way possible. Like most people, I can solve bits of an equation in my head, but I lose track of numbers as I go. They all just get jumbled around in my head, scattered across my mental whiteboard in black and white, with no sense of order. One mistake and I have to start the whole thing over. Using this method, you break out the factors separately and use the colors to imprint across different sections of your brain. This way, if you mess up at some point in the problem, you’ve still got an imprinted “save spot” to go back to, in the form of your last colored product/sum. You’ll see what I mean if you try it out.
So if you solve a part of the equation using this method, you imprint the product in color in your mind’s eye. Focus on the colored number in your mind in whatever form is easiest for you to remember. I like picturing mine as white digits on a colored background. This seems to imprint best for me personally, which brings up an important detail. Use any color scheme that you feel works best for you. I seem to be able to remember this particular pattern best. These colors in this order are easiest for my mind to retain. It’s exactly beefing up the RAM in your computer. Instead of only using the mathematical processing center of your brain, you’re using the graphic, color processing part to hold onto your products as you go.
As you solve each set, IMPRINT the colored product in your mind completely, so that it is well in-focus in your mind’s eye. This may take time, but that’s the point. You’re exercising your mind.
After you IMPRINT each colored product, WIPE out every other number you have in your mind. The point of this method is to tag or label products as you come to them and clear everything else out so you reduce mental clutter. You should only have 2 colored factors in your mind at any given time.
After you WIPE out all numbers but your most recent colored product, STACK it onto the next colored product by adding the two. Again, Label, Imprint, etc.
My first problem I attempted, while jotting these notes, took me about 10 minutes. After working on 4 more problems over the course of a day, I got down to 2 minutes, and actually did this while driving and listening to a neuroscience lecture (posted a few days ago on the blog). I’ve shown it to a couple of people, and while it’s not something that just jumps out at you the second you see it, once you start to get the point of the process (label, imprint, wipe, stack), I think it could help a lot of people do more complex math of various kinds in their head.
These are just notes, and I’ll I’ve had time to write down. See if it makes any sense, and if it helps anyone, I’ll actually put some effort into it and produce a simple guide with more detail and such.

Beat egg whites until stiff; add in yolks one at a time. Add sugar and baking soda and beat until thick and creamy (about 10-15mins). Add flour and club soda and mix to make a smooth batter. Steam on high for about 10 -15 mins.
This recipe is a modified version of hugbear’s recipe posted in Nurkochen. The recipe is modified to not use sponge stabilizer as it’s not available in the U.S.
I tried out the recipe.But my cup cakes did not "cracked up" like yours. How did you get that effect? It tasted good though.
Should we use all purpose flour to make these? Also, to have the crack effect, should we cut the top 3/4 way through steaming it?
Thanks for sharing. Loved how yours turn out. I'm crossing my finger hoping mine will turn out the same! :) I think this is the banh bo I was talking about. Maybe it is called Banh thuan after all. :)
just follow the instructions and don't be afraid of failure. Play with your food, if you think cutting the cakes 3/4 way through steaming it will help... then do it.
I would like to know what kind of flour did you use ? and the color , how can we add them to have that nice color ? also what is club soda .
What's the purpose of adding club soda? Also when I tried making these cup cakes, the smell of eggs is very strong, is there a way to get rid of the smell? Add coconut milk? Vanilla essence?
if you think adding coconut milk or Vanilla essence will help then, by all means please do. Play with your food! What do you have to lose?
I would really love to try out the recipes but i don't know how much 200g would convert into cups. please help!
Thank you HoangTam for the recipe. I got the cakes look exactly like yours. I gave my first batch to Mr. Trash but my second works so nice (5 out of 6 looks so beautiful).
no need to cut halfway,grandma used to sprinkle the granulated sugar carefully forming an "X" on the ready batter.during steaming the cakes will crack

Glitches are the frustrating byproduct of technology gone awry. Wildly scrambled images, frozen blue screens, and garbled sounds signify moments where we want to throw our expensive computer products out the window. Many artists and programmers, however, have embraced these crisis moments and discovered beauty in the glitch. By hacking familiar systems, they intentionally cause glitches, and manipulate them to create art. Enjoying the aesthetics of technological mistakes defies the notion that technology and entertainment has to be a seamless experience. Most importantly, glitch artists reveal a certain soulfulness that emerges when complex streams of information, visual media, and our own lives converge in the chaos of the glitch.

Globalization is defined as a process that, based on international strategies, aims to expand business operations on a worldwide level, and was precipitated by the facilitation of global. Globalization is one of the 21 st century's most important political topics you might have heard the term globalization used before, whether in an economics lecture or in a political debate as the world grows more connected through the internet and greater international trade, globalization is. Globalization is the free movement of goods, services and people across the world in a seamless and integrated manner globalization can be thought of to be the result of the opening up of the global economy and the concomitant increase in trade between nations. Boys are more likely to work in market work, that is, work for wages, work for a family farm, or work for a household business girls are more likely to participate in domestic work, such as fetching firewood, taking care of younger siblings, cooking, sewing. Globalization is good for workers, say most economists globalization is bad for workers, say most sociologists, anthropologists, and historians this article takes a more cautious.
Globalization has become a familiar enough word, the meaning of which has been discussed by others before me during this conference let me nonetheless outline briefly what i understand by the term i shall then go on to consider what has caused it. Globalization is bad for workers, say most sociologists, anthropologists, and historians this article takes a more cautious approach to this complex question. Globalization (or globalisation) is the process of international integration arising from the interchange of world views, products, ideas and other aspects of cultureadvances in transportation, such as the steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, container ships, and in telecommunications infrastructure, including the rise of the telegraph and.
By definition, globalization is the increasing integration of world economies through the expansion of trade, investment, technology, labor, and knowledge the impact of globalization on the poor is not a black or white issue. But globalization has not been good for working people (blue or white collar) and has led to the continuing deindustrialization of america globalization is a complicated issue. The loss of american jobs caused by globalization is a familiar, if controversial, story the economic policy institute, a think tank that favors labor groups, estimates that 28 million us jobs. I think the definition of low skill worker is discriminatory considering that they are the once to do the real work in economy high skilled economist and financiers have made it possible for 2008 crisis to happen.
A short definition of economic globalization is the trans-national increase in trade and capital humane treatment of workers and respect for the environment. The laid off unskilled workers are forced into the service sector where wages and benefits are low, but turnover is high 4 weak labor unions: the surplus in cheap labor coupled with an ever growing number of companies in transition has caused a weakening of labor unions in the united states. Noun the act of globalizing, or extending to other or all parts of the world: the globalization of manufacturing worldwide integration and development: globablization has resulted in the loss of some individual cultural identities. The concern, of course, is that a free-trade environment is letting good jobs drain from the us economy and wind up in china, india, and other countries where workers command much lower salaries in the extreme, some would like to see restraints on trade to protect those jobs and halt the globalization trend.
Globalization is good for workers, say most economists globalization is bad for workers, say most sociologists, anthropologists, and historians this article takes a more cautious approach, defining first the different dimensions of employment quality which can be measured in order to track changes (section 2. For globalization to be able to work, a country cannot be saddled with problems endemic to many developing countries, from a corrupt political class, to poor infrastructure, and macroeconomic instability. The impact of globalization on business can be placed into two broad categories: market globalization and production globalization market globalization is the decline in barriers to selling in.
Globalization or globalisation is the process of interaction and integration between people, companies, and governments worldwideglobalization has grown due to advances in transportation and communication technology. The thorough explanation of everything including globalization, a definition that is unclear to so many including me was perfect and assisted in your research i find the idea of globalization so interesting and symbolic of our modern world. Globalization is the process of increased interconnectedness among countries most notably in the areas of economics, politics, and culture mcdonald's in japan, french films being played in minneapolis, and the united nations are all representations of globalization. Globalization is a good thing globalization is a good thing when we are getting products from other countries, we create jobs in those countries, which allows us to get products for a lower price and similar quality also, the lower jobs that many americans would say are below them are outsourced to other cou.
Workers in globally engaged companies earn more than the average globalization has generated an increase in annual us income of approximately $1 trillion (average annual income gains of $10,000 per household.
Globalization is a topic that is often debated controversally it concerns all of us, but what exactly is globalization and what is its impact on every singl.
With 189 member countries, staff from more 170 countries, and offices in over 130 locations, the world bank group is a unique global partnership: five institutions working for sustainable solutions that reduce poverty and build shared prosperity in developing countries.
In its broadest sense, globalization refers to the economic, social, cultural, and political processes of integration that result from the expansion of transnational economic production, migration, communications, and technologies. Globalization is an emerging trend in business here you will learn the definition of globalization, examine its positive and negative effects, and be presented with real examples of globalization. Globalization seems to be looked on as an unmitigated good by economists unfortunately, economists seem to be guided by their badly flawed models they miss real-world problems in particular, they miss the point that the world is finite we don't have infinite resources, or unlimited. The full impact of globalization in the workplace has yet to be realized, but as more companies embrace this trend and become more diverse, certain changes are emerging.
Specifies which components in the GC are to be m. This argument is the bitwise inclusive OR of zero or more of the valid GC component mask bits.
The function attributes of a GC are used when you update a section of a drawable (the destination) with bits from somewhere else (the source). The function in a GC defines how the new destination bits are to be computed from the source bits and the old destination bits. GXcopy is typically the most useful because it will work on a color display, but special applications may use other functions, particularly in concert with particular planes of a color display. The 16 GC functions, defined in <X11/X.h>, are:
Many graphics operations depend on either pixel values or planes in a GC. The planes attribute is of type long, and it specifies which planes of the destination are to be modified, one bit per plane. A monochrome display has only one plane and will be the least significant bit of the word. As planes are added to the display hardware, they will occupy more significant bits in the plane mask.
In graphics operations, given a source and destination pixel, the result is computed bitwise on corresponding bits of the pixels. That is, a Boolean operation is performed in each bit plane. The plane_mask restricts the operation to a subset of planes. A macro constant AllPlanes can be used to refer to all planes of the screen simultaneously. The result is computed by the following:
Range checking is not performed on the values for foreground, background, or plane_mask. They are simply truncated to the appropriate number of bits. The line-width is measured in pixels and either can be greater than or equal to one (wide line) or can be the special value zero (thin line).
Wide lines are drawn centered on the path described by the graphics request. Unless otherwise specified by the join-style or cap-style, the bounding box of a wide line with endpoints [x1, y1], [x2, y2] and width w is a rectangle with vertices at the following real coordinates:
Here sn is the sine of the angle of the line, and cs is the cosine of the angle of the line. A pixel is part of the line and so is drawn if the center of the pixel is fully inside the bounding box (which is viewed as having infinitely thin edges). If the center of the pixel is exactly on the bounding box, it is part of the line if and only if the interior is immediately to its right (x increasing direction). Pixels with centers on a horizontal edge are a special case and are part of the line if and only if the interior or the boundary is immediately below (y increasing direction) and the interior or the boundary is immediately to the right (x increasing direction).
Thin lines (zero line-width) are one-pixel-wide lines drawn using an unspecified, device-dependent algorithm. There are only two constraints on this algorithm.
If a line is drawn unclipped from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] and if another line is drawn unclipped from [x1+dx,y1+dy] to [x2+dx,y2+dy], a point [x,y] is touched by drawing the first line if and only if the point [x+dx,y+dy] is touched by drawing the second line.
The effective set of points comprising a line cannot be affected by clipping. That is, a point is touched in a clipped line if and only if the point lies inside the clipping region and the point would be touched by the line when drawn unclipped.
A wide line drawn from [x1,y1] to [x2,y2] always draws the same pixels as a wide line drawn from [x2,y2] to [x1,y1], not counting cap-style and join-style. It is recommended that this property be true for thin lines, but this is not required. A line-width of zero may differ from a line-width of one in which pixels are drawn. This permits the use of many manufacturers' line drawing hardware, which may run many times faster than the more precisely specified wide lines.
In general, drawing a thin line will be faster than drawing a wide line of width one. However, because of their different drawing algorithms, thin lines may not mix well aesthetically with wide lines. If it is desirable to obtain precise and uniform results across all displays, a client should always use a line-width of one rather than a line-width of zero.
For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), when the cap-style is applied to both endpoints, the semantics depends on the line-width and the cap-style:
For a line with coincident endpoints (x1=x2, y1=y2), when the join-style is applied at one or both endpoints, the effect is as if the line was removed from the overall path. However, if the total path consists of or is reduced to a single point joined with itself, the effect is the same as when the cap-style is applied at both endpoints.
The tile/stipple represents an infinite two-dimensional plane, with the tile/stipple replicated in all dimensions. When that plane is superimposed on the drawable for use in a graphics operation, the upper-left corner of some instance of the tile/stipple is at the coordinates within the drawable specified by the tile/stipple origin. The tile/stipple and clip origins are interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in a graphics request. The tile pixmap must have the same root and depth as the GC, or a BadMatch error results. The stipple pixmap must have depth one and must have the same root as the GC, or a BadMatch error results. For stipple operations where the fill-style is FillStippled but not FillOpaqueStippled, the stipple pattern is tiled in a single plane and acts as an additional clip mask to be ANDed with the clip-mask. Although some sizes may be faster to use than others, any size pixmap can be used for tiling or stippling.
When drawing lines with line-style LineDoubleDash, the odd dashes are controlled by the fill-style in the following manner:
Storing a pixmap in a GC might or might not result in a copy being made. If the pixmap is later used as the destination for a graphics request, the change might or might not be reflected in the GC. If the pixmap is used simultaneously in a graphics request both as a destination and as a tile or stipple, the results are undefined.
For optimum performance, you should draw as much as possible with the same GC (without changing its components). The costs of changing GC components relative to using different GCs depend on the display hardware and the server implementation. It is quite likely that some amount of GC information will be cached in display hardware and that such hardware can only cache a small number of GCs.
The dashes value is actually a simplified form of the more general patterns that can be set with XSetDashes. Specifying a value of N is equivalent to specifying the two-element list [N, N] in XSetDashes. The value must be nonzero, or a BadValue error results.
The clip-mask restricts writes to the destination drawable. If the clip-mask is set to a pixmap, it must have depth one and have the same root as the GC, or a BadMatch error results. If clip-mask is set to None, the pixels are always drawn regardless of the clip origin. The clip-mask also can be set by calling the XSetClipRectangles or XSetRegion functions. Only pixels where the clip-mask has a bit set to 1 are drawn. Pixels are not drawn outside the area covered by the clip-mask or where the clip-mask has a bit set to 0. The clip-mask affects all graphics requests. The clip-mask does not clip sources. The clip-mask origin is interpreted relative to the origin of whatever destination drawable is specified in a graphics request.
You can set the subwindow-mode to ClipByChildren or IncludeInferiors. For ClipByChildren, both source and destination windows are additionally clipped by all viewable InputOutput children. For IncludeInferiors, neither source nor destination window is clipped by inferiors. This will result in including subwindow contents in the source and drawing through subwindow boundaries of the destination. The use of IncludeInferiors on a window of one depth with mapped inferiors of differing depth is not illegal, but the semantics are undefined by the core protocol.
The fill-rule defines what pixels are inside (drawn) for paths given in XFillPolygon requests and can be set to EvenOddRule or WindingRule. For EvenOddRule, a point is inside if an infinite ray with the point as origin crosses the path an odd number of times. For WindingRule, a point is inside if an infinite ray with the point as origin crosses an unequal number of clockwise and counterclockwise directed path segments. A clockwise directed path segment is one that crosses the ray from left to right as observed from the point. A counterclockwise segment is one that crosses the ray from right to left as observed from the point. The case where a directed line segment is coincident with the ray is uninteresting because you can simply choose a different ray that is not coincident with a segment.
For both EvenOddRule and WindingRule, a point is infinitely small, and the path is an infinitely thin line. A pixel is inside if the center point of the pixel is inside and the center point is not on the boundary. If the center point is on the boundary, the pixel is inside if and only if the polygon interior is immediately to its right (x increasing direction). Pixels with centers on a horizontal edge are a special case and are inside if and only if the polygon interior is immediately below (y increasing direction).
Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails to match in some other way required by the request.
Some numeric value falls outside the range of values accepted by the request. Unless a specific range is specified for an argument, the full range defined by the argument's type is accepted. Any argument defined as a set of alternatives can generate this error.

Energy is the heart beat of every economy, globally. The source of this critical element is the sale determinant of the end users' effects as far as concerns the state of the atmosphere, the climate and the survival of the flora and the fauna. The study will seek economically viable ways to enrich the octane-poor sorghum bio-oil to an octane rich bio-fuel for effective performance in motor engines.
The broad objective of the study is to develop a conventional process through which bio-oil from herbaceous plants (sorghum) could be extracted and. be eventually octane- enriched so as to effectively perform in internal combustion engines.
The specific objectives of the study are: To identify the physical and chemical properties of sorghums bio-fuel potential pertinent to the process design; applying the parameters identified to develop an economically based process design model which can be employed for design purposes, or serve as a springboard for green energy research endeavors.
To achieve the above objectives a series of runs using different amounts of concentrations of the reactant (CA, in /liter of solvent) will be made. This will be followed by choosing the highest CA,in as the bases for calculating the amount of feed rate (F AO) and the conversions. For each run, feed rate, work, reactants and concentrations) (F AO, W, XA (in-out); will be determined.
Conclusively therefore, a series of rate concentration data will be gathered. That data and any other information affecting the productivity of the process i.e., the quality and the quantity of the yield will be subjected to the differential methods of analysis.
The resulting values hence will be substituted in the performance equation and eventually to an economic maximization model to determine the process' economic viability. The resulting values will then be substituted to an overall performance equation from which design parameters will be derived. Comparative efficiency tests of the bio-fuel produced will be tested against existing bio-fuels and the conventional fuels. All possible engine performance tests against the corresponding conventional fuels will be made.
It is envisaged that the model will provide an informative frame work that will found a basis for future unit design ventures, and owing to the abundance of sorghum plant in Kenya, its low water requirements and negligible demand for attention from the farmer, the study deserves prioritizing.

On ‘Get Hurt’, their fifth studio album it appears that The Gaslight Anthem have finally decided to move on from the soul inspired punk rock for which they are known. Changing direction is always a dangerous move for a band synonymous with a particular sound, and The Gaslight Anthem are no different. Things could have gone either way; the band could have emerged triumphant, proving their credentials as more than just the Springsteen imitators they are still viewed as by some, or it could have been a disaster. Perhaps predictably, the answer lies somewhere in between.
On the surface, things sound very Gaslight. The soft/loud dynamics are still there, there are still songs about New Jersey and the girls are all still referred to as ‘baby’, but there’s more to ‘Get Hurt’ than meets the eye. The title track sparkles with the kind of romance and vulnerability that has become one of the band’s hallmarks but at the same time the atmospheric, expansive sound signals a progression from the immediacy and directness of ‘Sink or Swim’ or ‘The ’59 Sound’ in favour of a more nuanced approach.
Alongside this there are still songs that bristle with all the punk rock energy you’d expect. ‘Rollin’ and Tumblin’ is perhaps the best of the bunch, providing a much needed shot in the arm just as the album is in danger of slipping into a malaise, reminding listeners of exactly what the band does best.
For all the romantic imagery and rose-tinted depictions of blue-collar America, Gaslight Anthem albums have always had their heart on their sleeve, raw and unashamed. The more reserved approach adopted throughout much of ‘Get Hurt’ makes the album less instantly memorable and less easy to relate to. Given time there’s every chance that the subtleties and nuances of Get Hurt could mark it out as being every bit as good as anything the band have ever done, but on first impressions it doesn’t have the same impact.
That’s not to say that Get Hurt isn’t a good album, with some excellent songs on it. But, if you’re looking for more of the blue collar punk of the band’s early years, you might initially be underwhelmed by what it has to offer.
After emerging in shroud of mystery and refining her sound over multiple EPs, a period of personal upheaval proved the driving force necessary for Amber Bain’s debut full-length to finally take shape.

My dear friend Marcy and I have been planning this day for a long time. She has a very special dog named Duper that we decided would come down here to Florida to get some showing experience under his belt. Also under my belt! He would give me an opportunity to show a stellar dog that is a true showman! I’ve never had that before and I’m very excited for the opportunity!
I will be showing him at the Brooksville circuit next month if all goes well and I cannot wait to learn from him while he soaks in the Florida sunshine. His coat is absolutely amazing! I wonder what the warmer weather’s going to do do it? I know that cold weather will grow a nice, thick coat. I think he has enough to share! I think my lessons are going to start in grooming that’s for sure!
Within minutes of him walking into the house he fit right in with Figgy crew like he been here forever! He’s going to do just fine.

my redUniverse quark still have a lot of features missing that i want to put in. it is endless work and i only get to it now and then. but at least after today the helpfiles are in a bit better shape, and examples are changed to use animate to run more smoothly (most now look a lot better!).
* changed almost all the other examples to use animate instead of play and to close the window at cmd+.
if you want to use the \point type of shape it will look better with smoothing set to false and Vertex.pointSize= 0;
i took some code i had for performing k-means clustering and made it into a proper class. i also found Dan Stowell's KMeans quark and borrowed some concepts from that one. my version works slightly different and uses RedVectors of any dimension.
the class is part of my redUniverse quark and the best way to install it is as always to from within supercollider type... Quarks.install("redUniverse"); and then recompile. a helpfile and simple examples are included but i hope to write more elaborate demonstrations of this later on.
this is a screenshot from the example in the RedKMeans helpfile. 1000 random points are categorised into 5 groups/clusters. the bigger circles are the 5 mean points/centroids.
the screenshot below is of a simple little mac application i made in max/msp/jitter. it takes realtime input from a web or dv-camera, chops it into six regions and tracks activity in each of those regions separately. the result is sent over to supercollider via osc.
the analysis/tracking is just a simple average luminescence per frame. i.e. it takes the mean of all the red, green and blue values in one frame and then calculate the luma with (0.299*red)+(0.587*green)+(0.114*blue). the luma will be close to 0 for dark frames and close to 1 for very bright video frames.
to tune this system to produce maximal output, one should first make sure the camera sits still and has sufficient and stable light. then in the software there are colour, brightness and contrast controls to help get even better readings. (completely inverting all the colours might help in really dark places.)
the luma values (float 0.0-1.0) can be rounded off to nearest number and also smoothed out. this is often necessary to avoid flutter and noise. and most important - there is manual calibration of the luma values - either per region or globally.
to calibrate one should first empty the camera's view of any objects and then press the 'calibrate min' button in the lower left corner. then move some objects around to see what is the maximum reading. last put that number into the 'set max' numberbox. one can also calibrate each region separately with the min and max buttons next to the preview windows.
here are my best-of twitter tweets so far. see twitter.com/redFrik for the rest. with the hard limitation of 140 characters, it is really challenging to write a piece of supercollider code that fits and sounds good _and is interesting to listen to for more than a few seconds.
99 sine oscillators played one after the other with a two seconds interval. each oscillator lasts for 27 seconds. so the total duration is 99*2+27= 225 seconds. the oscillators are phase modulated with other sine oscillators with frequencies repeating in the number series: 500, 501, 502, 603, 604, 605, 706, 707, 708. the base frequencies of the 99 carrier oscillators slowly raise by one hertz from 1 to 99. the only random thing is the stereo panning position for each oscillator.
a clip noise generator runs through a moog filter and then a reverb. every third second there is a new noise added and each noise lasts for 22 seconds. each moog filter has two unique parabolic lfos that runs at a random rate between 0 and 0.3 hertz - each in one channel. at the most there are 8 number of overlapping noises playing at the same time. as there are so many reverbs playing here at once one needs to allocate more memory to sc server. something like this... Server.local.options.memSize= 32768; and then reboot the localhost server.
this one is completely deterministic although it is hard to believe when hearing it. a lot of nested feedbacking sine oscillators. nine parallel oscillators are mixed down to 1 and duplicated in left and right channels. each of the nine oscillators is frequency and feedback modulated but have a static amplitude of 1/9. the frequency modulator consist of yet more modulated feedbacking sine oscillators, while the feedback of the outer is only modulated with a single feedbacking sine oscillator running at 0.1 hertz. all in all there are 109 unit generators in total running in this tweet and it peaks at about 9.3% of my computer's cpu.
these four all work the same way. they only differ in buffer size and what kind of oscillator is used for reading back samples from the buffer. there is not much progress over longer time but they do have characted and subtle though deterministic variation in the details.
this tweet is also totally deterministic and without any randomness. here a lot of nested square wave oscillators creates the complexity. basically there are 4 channels/voices mixed down to one and then duplicated in left and right channel. there are three levels deep nesting of frequency modulation with another set of square waves mixed and added.
binary numbers from 0 to 255 form the rhythmic patterns in this tweet. each number first repeats 8 times - each time all the bits are shifted one position to the left. that creates an array of 64 ones and zeros. this array is then repeated four times. this is what makes it sound like a 4 x 4/4 bar theme (i.e. 4 bars per number). the total 64*4*256 binary digits are played in sequence and each digit lasts for 1/50th of a second. the total duration becomes 64*4*256/50= 1310.72 seconds. the sound is generated by the ones and the zeros directly. there is an exponential decay for these flipflop pulses that slowly increases throughout the 256 numbers. it starts with a decay time of 0.008 seconds and ends with 2.04 seconds. in the mp3 below only the numbers 0-31 are played.
another tweet without any randomness. there are five paralles routines and all do something 500 times. what they do is to define or redefine a node proxy. there are 25 proxies in total and each one contains a sine shaped oscillator panned to one out of four positions in the stereo field. the frequencies are climbing upwards in a slightly jaggered curve. the exact length is a bit complicated to calculate but it is around 575 seconds. in the end the proxies do not stop to play but just keeps the last assigned frequency and the whole soundscape becomes static.
attached is a klee step-sequencer as a supercollider list-pattern class. the included helpfile should explain how it works.
there are a couple of ways to make a klee sequencer on the server side as well. in the below examples i used argument lists, but one can also do it using buffers together with the index ugen.
here are two supercollider documents made years ago to resemble two max/msp patches by katsuhiro chiba. his patches are really wonderfully constructed with playful and nice gui design plus they sounded good to me. so i was curious how he made them and to learn more i ported parts of his code to sc. the max4 patches are still available here along with some screenshots.
there was a sleeping-bag concert as part of the sound of stockholm festival this year. music for sleeping - what a great concept!
first i was assigned to play last and would thereby have had the honour/responsibility of waking everybody up for breakfast at 7:00 in the morning. both fun and daunting. how to let your audience sleep in as long as possible and then wake them up gently but firmly?
i assumed most people would be asleep when it was my turn and that i myself also would be very tired. so i prepared my solo set (using redThermoKontroll) to be extremely simple and static in nature. hardly no variation - only a couple of sounds sources (4 sc patches i think it was) with looong transitions between settings that i could control manually.
then there was the waking up part and for that i wrote the very simple sounding code below. it starts slowly with one little alarm going off. then a second alarm, then more and more until complete chaos. i made it so that this patch could be mixed in with my drones and with separate control over volume.
unfortunately when i got to stockholm they had changed the playing order and i did do my performance around midnight instead. and i never set the alarms off.
All the while Lena stayed on him. Now he had a nice view as her tummy rolled and her hips swayed as she rode him.
Like a gear stick, she clutched and shifted his cock with her inner flesh. He felt so good inside of her.
The longer they went, the more she wanted. and she wanted it faster and harder. She bucked roughly on his hips.
As he had done so many times already, Marko read her mind and body language and leaned forward, taking hold of her waist. Live cam sex.

For nearly 250 years, the Canada's fur trade was a thriving industry that played a major role in the creation of the country. After decades of suffering from an anti-fur image problem, Canada's fur trade has found a new market: Thanks to China's booming middle class and Russia's luxury-starved oligarchy, the industry that founded the nation is on a comeback. In the first episode of our new series CANADIANA, VICE travelled to the Northwest Territories to meet a modern day fur trapper—Andrew Stanley, the Metis YouTube star who's become the unlikely ambassador of Canada's trapping world. We visit Andrew's remote cabin in the northern wilderness to go full tilt into the Canadian trap life—trapping beavers, skinning an otter, and learning the best way to deal with two frozen 160-pound wolves infected with mange. CANADIANA is VICE Canada's new show where they explore the further reaches of their home and native land to find the strange and fascinating stories that make this country unique.

So he traps animals and skins them but then he has a dog well that makes sense doesn’t it , how disgusting
Any anti that want to threaten Andrew better wear there big boy panties if they go after him. You won't return to your cozy life.
ANDREW is what this country WAS BUILT ON and buy the way it,s what MADE our nation and founded our territory.This is the real world and this is a real man. Walk one day in his shoe,s and you might learn a thing or two if you could or are able to.GIVER ANDREW AND STAY WILD DONT LET EM TAME YOU.
Its kinda sad that that’s the only job that’s fun to him is killing animals..What’s wrong with people
God put animals on this earth to use for resources. He gave them to us to do as we please. If you dont want to eat animals, then dont. If you dont want to use animal fur, then dont. But stop trying to force your beliefs on everyone else
people who want to kill others should be baited in, setting them up to make their attempt, and then shoot them dead in self defense, like the pos's that they ARE.
My Grandfather was a very good trapper and his brothers were the same all 4 of them did taxidermy as well when they hit the shores of Toronto in the 1920s and moved North to the Muskoka's for al their lives. Today I love to watch them Live as I have Never killed a critter except for a chickadee when I was first shown the gun for hunting. I Never shot again except targets and people who get to close =) A Man has a right to do as he wants as long as it doesn't hurt anyone and this guy is very respectful but doesn't understand how FEW critters are left =((( I hope a Grizzly scares him out of the bush for good. Like Whale hunting all these practices are so outdated they should be banned and FUCK the CHINESE let them farm their own~ Im a chef all my life so Im no dummy if you kill it-eat it~~~
Fur is beautiful. What this man is doing is noble work. Stupid AR people are very far removed from nature. He is not killing endangered animals. His life is in perfect harmony with nature. Animal rights is a stupid idea. Go hug a lion. See what happens.
Rabbix Edwards That's because it's a natural, high quality, renewable resource. You can wear plastic garbage if you wish, but it's not good for the Earth.
PETA kills more animals every year than this guy could do in ten lifetimes. Nothing wrong with an honest living.
I prefer wild fur rather than farm raised fur The animal had a good life even tho I don't really want to care about it I'll wear it
Avid hunters and proffesional trappers ironically are one of the active groups interested in conservation. The trapper has a financial interest that the animals he kills have a clean large environment, as well as hunters they enjoy being outdoors and enjoying the beautiful scenery. Hikers and climbers are not enough you don’t need as much land to enjoy a pretty bike trail as you do to sustain healthy populations of wildlife. You will also notice the trapper at the end killed and burned wolves with mange. Mange is highly contagious and destroying wildlife infected is the fastest way to prevent an outbreak. Hunting parks in Africa also use hunters to kill old, sick, and or dangerous aggressive animals, as well as money to maintain the parks. Responsible hunting and trapping should be encouraged as they keep away poachers who are people who really give no fucks about the environment
Is this dude fucking around. No way his accent is like that naturally. He's over playing it isn't he?
Nice Video clip! Excuse me for butting in, I would appreciate your thoughts. Have you considered - Proutklarton Surviving Technics Plan (google it)? It is a smashing one of a kind product for learning how to survive any crisis minus the headache. Ive heard some amazing things about it and my buddy at last got amazing results with it.
That part of the world theres few opportunities to make a wage to live on. Fur trapping is how they stay alive.
Why do animal rights activists focus on trapping and hunting when farmers are raising cows to eat them
I get it that these people have a 'tradition' to keep, or whatever (!) But we have fake fur now and cold-resistant clothing... We really don't need to wear real fur coats anymore. People only buy fur now for vanity reasons, and that's why I find it unacceptable- these animals are dying needlessly for someone's vanity.
ZeeZee Zputnik You wanna wear plastic garbage that you put in the landfill after a couple of years? Fur is a natural, sustainable, and renewable high quality product that lasts decades.
The only things wearing fur should be the animals, I would make a very slight exception for the people within the arctic who have worn fur out of necessity for thousands of years. They've eaten the animal and used its fur and their dogs would eat any leftovers. I only then agree with it if the animal is shot and killed instantly with absolutely no suffering. Traps cause horrendous painful deaths where the animal literally starves to death with a severely broken leg. Some animals have been known to bite their leg off to escape from the trap and that would be agonising. No animal should ever feel pain at the hands of humans. If you must kill then be ethical and learn to shoot so you know you can get a 'head shot' first time.I'm disgusted that in the U.K. fur has made a comeback, having been taboo for so many years.
All of the cosmetic products are tested on lab mice, but does that mean Women should stop using foundation? We are all hypocrites, its not ok to wear fur but its ok to wear leather products. We can't eat dogs but we are eating pigs and cows every day. Media and the public can say whatever they want, but I think if you had just one piece of meat for meal in your entire life,that means you are guilty. So check your self. fuckin hypocrites.
I don't see a problem with people doing this in the past since we needed it to keep warm, but now a days (which by the way what I'm about to say is cheaper too) we have other alternatives in place that we can use such as faux fur.
Do you think you will go anywhere nice when you die, you fuckin scum of the earth ? Hope you die in excutiating pain, REAL SLOW .
As long as people aren't hunting endangered species, then I don't see nor have a problem with it. This man is making his living doing this, so props to him. Animal rights activists are scumbags anyway. Fuckers are like animal Nazi's.
i don't see why everyone gets so pissed about this he is only doing his job ya don't get pissed off at a soldier for killing humans
To all animal rights activists trashing this guy fuck off, this guy is trying to make a living lile everyone else just he hunts animals for there fur which is fine because most likely your ancestors did it too, furtrapping is what's Canada is built on!
The comment section is filled with retarded vegens shame on you evil vegens for eating all the poor little animals food
How is this supposed to be shocking this is normal all people who live in the country do this what about what happens to dogs and bears in china?
My uncle used to be a fisherman and would go seal hunting in Newfoundland. I know people complain about catching the seals but there are plenty of them. Many fisherman would die seal hunting and most had too to survive during the winter. Newfoundland used to be really poor and a lot of fishermen were not even paid. You were just given salt and supplies for your catch.
Until the anti-crowd consumes only synthetics there's no moral leg to stand on. Threatening a human being for harvesting a tree while sipping on a tea made from dead plants killed for the purpose of their consumption only shows how derelict they are. Threatening a human being for taking wild animals for whatever purpose isn't any different. Who can really say which species from which kingdoms contains life more worthy than any other? One thing is evident from these people by the threats they wager; that they hold more value of their own ignorant opinions than they do for "life".
JussTreddn The synthetic products damage the environment. Better to use a natural, sustainable, renewable, high quality product like fur and leather.
If the animals weren't culled,then there would be mass starvation if there was too high a population to sustain themselves. Judging by the area hes in,plenty of wildlife from what I can see.Hes native,doing the same thing the tribes have done since creation.I cant see any environmental damage. The man is supporting himself and not on benefits.He is improvising and doing what he has to do.
he doesn't hunt the same area consecutively...he respects the animals cycles and allows them to breed. He doesn't hunt young animals on purpose and dispatches them as quickly as possible. Him and his ancestors have been doing this for many years. He's a good man.
I grew up trapping, I really respect that guy for the amount of time and work trapping nowadays isn't even worth it. he just makes enough to g e t by
Andrew is the shit!!! I watch all of his videos, glad to see Vice went to see him and give him some love! Just realized it was posted a year ago, and Vice you should change the name of the video to a visit with Andrew of the north or something a bit more respectful to Andrew...
The Vetheist fuck right off. You can chose to live how you want but don't push it on other people please.
The Vetheist Intelligence has nothing to do with your argument. You have no purpose here other than spouting your 'beliefs' about your 'feelings'. Your willful ignorance is an embarrassment to actual environmentalists everywhere. I deal in facts, so if that's too much for you, you're welcome to listen and learn.
It's over so fast in a 220 or 330 conibear... far more humane than what most wild creatures endure looking for their next meal. It's nearly instant peace.
The Vetheist I've seen a number of comments from you now....maybe you have some morbid fascination with this lifestyle and that's why you watch the entire video....you're the sick one
The Vetheist Yes...you are the morbid one. Don't watch things that bother you so much. Many people enjoy the way he lives so why do you come here and shit on him and other people. Get the fuck out of here if you don't agree with it. He's a good person.
The first time I met Andrew I was looking for a video on smoking moose meat.....I was hooked on both....careful don't burn your fkn eye ballz! Haha
This man is a hard working, dedicated professional. He is great! I'm a big fan. Love Charlie the dog!
Daisy Mouri yes love the dog but don't give a crap about the other animals he's killing. you are a speciesist congratulations
Nice title for the video.... Completely erasing any chance of having a real dialog about the Trapping industry, Culture and frankly the livelihoods of thousands of Canadians who are, by right. Through hundreds of years of wars and dialog going to continue to trap fur. You want a example of media propaganda? But Andrews Channel is by far my favorite Youtube channel LMAO Fucking eh bud
Props to him for living and doing such hard work to subside. Loving how so many people who live the comfortable life and hide behind a keyboard attack this behaviour. It show your true colours. If I had an opportunity to live out in the bush I would jump on it.
Just an FYI for people who don't know: the fur market is absolute garbage rn. Fur prices are soooooooo down. Don't let this make you think that fur harvesting is easy money because it's really not.
Frankly, there is more cruelty and less pro-environment thinking in the cotton and soy industries, although the oil industry. Something that many green people depend on.
What you say is BULLSHIT, full of bias, you are not the majority and the argument that is not useful is just your opinion, the fur and leather are materials (although biodegradable) with a long span of life if proper care is given; the materials you speak about (fabrics) are expensive if they are of high quality and this arise another problem (aside of the low quality of the most), most of the industries of fabric are in the third world, work abuse is common and although the growth of the industries are base on the degradation of the soil, the apparent economic resources (vegetable or petroleum based) although very costly in many terms (economic, ecologic, cultural...) are based in a culture of consumerism where the fabric is detached as anything and if it doesn't end in places as Free-town surely most of these cloth end as contaminants in the ocean. You are the example of what I say about the hypocrisy of the population that believe that contaminating and wasting resources and sustaining industries of countries that do not care for the biodiversity and the quality of life of their citizens is less cruel than the natural act of depredation, it's childish, and in fact, the industry of peltry in Canada or New Scotland prove that there is a way to kill the farmed animals quickly without any pain at all, even the trapping industry is very quick in that if the proper tramps and snares are used; depredation should not be considered cruelty for the simple fact that most animals die at hand of other animals and normally their deaths are very painful, it's the natural cycle of life and that's why we have to be mature about that fact, the fact that we can't go through life thinking that we levitate and our action don't have consequences, it's about to be mature about the drama of death an sustain a proper control over any industry that involve living beings, because they are resources and by that, wealth. thinking that killing animals to use them as a resource at the level of psychopathic torture is another bias (although reveal that you consider the meat industry as something horrible, you are vegan though. I mean, it needs a reformation but is not bad), this could continue ad infinitum but I've made my points very clear. I have to say that I am with you in that of being conscious of what we buy though.
Germán Rivas they are all issues. and as a vegan and environmentalists I buy all my products consciously, how and where they were produced and developed. as for fur, it was useful for people thousands of years ago where they NEEDED to use animals fur (even though I still think it's extreme and barbaric for that time as well) but since we have developed material that mocks fur to keep warm or any other materials for that matter, it is unnecessary and cruel to keep doing this ESPECIALLY for such a capitalistic reason, just for profit. that's all it is. people live their money. it's sad that they have to rely on the lives of innocent beings to make money. there is no consciousness and selflessness there. it's all materialism.
as with all natural resources they need to be managed. so that you dont over balance the system. when done properly you make the animal population healthier hence stronger
Andrew did those wolves a favor by killing them to die from the mange is a terrible way to go.i have trapped coyotes here in Ohio that did not have a hair on their bodies covered in sores their tale chewed off by them as short as they could reach nasty fuck in shit I tell ya lol Andrew is the real deal !
Christopher Hughes I shot a fox the other night that had about 3/4 of his hair gone only had some hair on his neck and head...talk about some nasty shit. I was deer hunting and the only reason I shot em was put put the hideous fuckin thing out of its misery
"looks like it was made in the 1940's, I don't know how that makes me feel safety wise". Ok, first thing you said it yourself, it has been flying for probably 60 years or so. If anything should tell you about reliability it is something that has outlasted millions of people lifetimes. What is with Vice news journalists and having zero sense of the world. Are they all just from deep cities or something?
+Leroy Spires Agreed, they need to not only get out in the wilderness but they need to spend time learning it... It amazes me how out of touch they are with reality.
Can't believe all of the idiots that are against our lifestyle. There's nothing wrong with hunting and trapping. None of the species we hunt and trap are remotely close to being endangered. Hunting and trapping does more good for the health of our country's wild animals. If there were no hunters and trappers the same amount of animals would die from starvation bcuz there's only a certain amount of natural food in an ecosystem. Not to mention the fact that in this video he took out two wolves with mange and destroyed them for the well being of all the other animals. Anti hunting animal activists are as sad and dumb as they can possibly get. Hunting and trapping is here to stay so they'd better find something else to protest and rebel against! Goodbye and happy hunting!
All the people who think that its animal cruelty. I shoot rabbits and wallaby for fur/meat and sometimes just for fun.Now go complain about the coffee industry who uses child slave labour!
People need to learn that trapping helps regulate the animals. Much like humans we breed out of control and like everything it needs regulations, those who are saying oh its cruel. Its not. Trapper for 8 years so come at me.
Because he was an angel, Castiel initially expressed almost no emotion towards humans, and had little room for disobedience or feelings, as he was driven to follow his orders, although he does reveal some doubts about the morality of his orders, expressing an appreciation for the beauty of humans as Gods creations. As he spends more time with Dean, he develops empathy and affection for him, and eventually for those close to him, and humans in general. Castiels superiors begin to question his loyalty and promote Uriel to oversee him. Castiel eventually rebels against and is ostracised from heaven, leaving him deprived of most of his angelic abilities, forcing him to interact more with humans than he had previously. He is often confused by the finer details of human interaction and is blind to social norms. He allies himself with Dean, and despite his despondency over the absence of his maker and their desperate situation, Castiel continues to fight against the Apocalypse.
After his second resurrection by God, with enhanced abilities, he sees his decisions and support of freewill to have been affirmed. Castiel begins to show pride, while remaining somewhat naive with regard to consequences. Crowley is able manipulate this budding sense of pride to get Castiel to start the angelic civil war. Castiel becomes dedicated to his own decisions, and tends to pass over other opinions, even Deans, in the absence of another clear course. He eventually double-crosses Crowley, taking in the souls of Purgatory alone. He then insists on worship from his former friends. He intends to be an involved god, a better and loving god who will not abandon the world. He renounces his dedication to free will, saying that angels need a firm hand. He is quick to smite those he feels to be hypocritical and unjust, and rewards those who have faith. However, Castiel is being influenced by entities inside him - including leviathans - and his actions become erratic and violent. He realizes he is not strong enough to contain the power, and at a prompt from Sam, he goes to the brothers for help. He is apologetic and humbled; after the souls are out of him he wants to find a way to redeem himself before the brothers. He eventually takes Sams madness on himself, freeing Sam. In episode 5.14 My Bloody Valentine, Castiel shows his deep affection towards raw meat, eating it in the room and unable to get to famine, one of the four horsemen. Here, we realize that Castiels vessel, Jimmy Novak is desiring the food which he cannot gain access to with the angel possessing him. Castiels insanity after taking on Sams memories of Hell seems to free him of some of his guilt, though it leaves his mind scattered. He was unwilling to fight due to his belief that he is a "jinx," though Dean convinces him to help kill Dick Roman. He also expresses some fondness for Meg despite the previous animosity that existed between them. However, after getting trapped in Purgatory, Castiel seemed to have regained his sanity, though he admitted there is no way to know for sure. However, his experiences have changed his personality somewhat and he is no longer as aloof as he usually is and has displayed a fondness for human things he took for granted such as watching television, which he never understood before. 4.01 Lazarus Rising.

My earliest memory of Memorial Day was going to the cemetery to place flowers on graves. It always made me feel just a little bit weird to realize that in the ground beneath my feet lay all that remained of a human body. Since I didn’t have x-ray vision, I imagined that mummified bodies lay in air-tight coffins. When we visited the old cemeteries where some of the graves were sunken, I carefully avoided those areas fearful that I might fall through.
I always noticed the American flags, but most of the graves we visited were family and not necessarily military. Sometimes we would run into other family members who were placing plastic floral arrangements on graves. Then, it was a time to enjoy seeing the living.
It seems it was usually hot, and shade is hard to come by in most cemeteries. Often a table is set up where you could make donations for the upkeep. Nobody likes to see overgrown brushy cemeteries. The old cemetery where my great-grandparents are buried is usually cleared by family members. I saw some people on Facebook planning a time to work on it since it wasn’t done this year.
Most people celebrate life on Memorial Weekend with picnics. The red, white, and blue is the only thing that says Memorial Day more than grilled hotdogs and hamburgers.
For the last nine years I have visited the Missouri Veterans Cemetery in Higginsville for their Memorial Day Services. Although several artificial arrangements will be placed on graves, the cemetery rules call for cut flowers. Flowers are usually easy to find, but it is a challenge to find a plastic (unbreakable) vase to put them in. This year, I lucked out. I bought a dozen roses and found a clear plastic container. I decorated it with patriotic duck tape and with some red ribbon. I always like to put Jim’s name on the arrangement I take, but this year it suddenly occurred to me to put his picture too. I printed out a shipping label, covered it with clear packing tape. I was pleased with the results.
This year, my sister-in-law Ginger and my great-niece made the trip with me. We stopped at McDonald’s and arrived at the cemetery a mere twenty minutes before the scheduled start time. We were directed to park near the new columbarium. We followed the sidewalk, crossed the bridge, and made it to the original columbarium just in time for the services to begin. The special guest speaker, Senator David Pearce, talked about how families had put special inscriptions on the stones. He began to read a few of them and one was “Rest High on That Mountain”—Jim’s stone.
Mayor Bill Kolas, Higginsville, spoke about how the traditions of Memorial Day has changed. Memorial Day used to be the signal that it was okay to wear white shoes. Of course, in today’s world, we wear white shoes when we feel like it. Instead of being “Decoration Day” to honor the fallen, for some people it’s all about picnics and sports. He talked about how school children no longer learn the history of World War I, or World War II—how they’ve never learned about Pearl Harbor, Normandy, Iwo Jima, Okinawa—because text book companies have left them out. This lack of history, he said, included governments. When President Charles DeGaulle demanded that all U.S. troops be evacuated off French soil, President Johnson directed Secretary of State Rusk to ask if that included the American soldiers buried there.
I was able to walk along the side and placed the roses in front of Jim’s niche during the ceremony. I stood beneath the shade of my umbrella for the remainder of the program. When the speakers were finished, the rifle volley and “Taps” reminded us more than words of the veteran’s sacrifices for the good of the country, for our freedom.
It was a lovely service in a beautiful cemetery that honors our Missouri Veterans. Flags from the branches of service, the POW flag, the Missouri State Flag, and Old Glory flapped in the breeze, keeping watch over the veterans. As the crowd began to clear, peace blanketed the cemetery.
It seems that no matter what you want to do, someone will remind you, “There’s an app for that,” and sure enough there is. Often it is things you don’t even think about. “How did you tie that scarf?” There’s an app for that. Apple owns the trademark for the slogan, but it now pops up in everyday language.
It has become a running joke that apps can make the difficult easy. They provide quick, simple solutions. We now have an “app generation” that knows they can click on an icon and have the knowhow that used to be passed from generation to generation. They take for granted having the world at their fingertips, a world that we couldn’t even imagine when we were kids.
As personal electronic devices become easier and more user friendly, we boomers have come to embrace the wonderful world of technology. What we have learned is something that younger generations have always had. We went through years of schooling without spell check, grammar check, the ability to just back up to erase the typed word, no Google search for research papers, rotary telephones plugged into a wall that served one purpose—conversation, and no concept of what an “app” was, or that it would ever exist.
Even those of us boomers with wild imaginations didn’t foresee the day when school kids would be walking around with text books on a slim device. And the thought of being in constant communication with our parents would have probably seemed more like a nightmare than a desired condition. Our parents were parents—not our best friends.
Now that we boomers are reaching the age when we are most vulnerable to Alzheimer’s, the brave new world has come up with a possible solution—maybe, just maybe, there is, or will be, an app for people with dementia.
I read an article this morning about Apple and Google technology helping fight Alzheimer’s disease. The article spoke of tests and treatments disguised as games. Wrist watches and eye glasses that could be used for GPS tracking, facial recognition, and help with daily living.
Maybe more research should go into developing smart phones, or other electronic devices, specifically for people with dementia, especially those who are in early stages. Devices would need to be easy to keep track of, super easy to use with voice activated apps, and pictures.
Think about the problems that people in the early stages of dementia have—they forget appointments, forget to take medication, get lost, have trouble communicating, and trouble problem solving. Well, I know for a fact that I’ve used my smart phone to solve the first three problems on that list. I’m not too likely to forget appointments when my smart phone reminds me. I had trouble remembering to take my morning medication until I put a reminder on my phone. Getting lost is not an option with GPS on my phone. Wouldn’t it be easier for the memory impaired to communicate if they could see the person they were talking to instead of just hearing them? After all, words are only seven percent of our communication with each other. Facial expressions are included in body language and account for 55 percent. We’ve already discussed that there’s an app for solving a myriad of problems.
Why not have Medicare dollars pay for technology to enhance independent ability rather than drugs that cause side effects and often diminish alertness? Not only can technology help now, it will be even more beneficial for future generations who have technology entrenched in their long-term memories.
I used to think that older/retired people didn’t need much sleep. Seemed like after years of forcing themselves out of bed during their working years, they found themselves jumping out of bed at sunrise just because that’s when they felt like getting up. When you think about it, that works well for someone who goes to bed early. If you have your eight hours of shut-eye in by daylight, you are going to want to jump up and start the day early.
Then there’s those like me who stay up until midnight. A full night’s sleep will still get me out of bed by eight and that’s plenty early. What I don’t like is when I wake up in the middle of the night and can’t go back to sleep. Last night, I woke up at about three thirty. I tossed, turned, and tried to go back to sleep. No luck. Then, when I thought it might happen, my weather alert radio went off. I dragged my sleepy self to the kitchen to turn it off. I pushed the button that tells what the alert is, and it started giving a regular forecast. I didn’t hear anything resembling weather that warranted the alarm.
Back in bed, I couldn’t help but think there should have been a reason for the bells and whistles disturbing my peace. Well, with my smart phone, I normally receive weather alerts on Facebook and via email, not to mention radar, and Google news. I debated. Browsing the Internet tends to keep me awake, but better safe than sorry, right? Okay, curiosity won.
First email. No alert. Then, Facebook. Oh geeze, couldn’t help but look at all the old photos posted for Mother’s Day. They just went on, and on. Time passed. It was soon four thirty, and I was wide awake. Still, determined to sleep awhile longer, I put down the phone and resumed tossing and turning, mind churning.
In the still of the night, I started thinking about how seemingly insignificant decisions or events changed the entire course of my life. I thought about the chain of events that led up to meeting Jim… On a summer Saturday, my mom and I were in the Dew Drop Inn eating hamburgers and fries when Kenny Fisher walked in. My mom knew him and introduced me. A week later, Kenny, “Uncle Orvie,” introduced me to his nephew. In many ways, it was a random meeting on an otherwise uneventful day in a series of uneventful days. Yet, that chance meeting changed the course of my life.
Sometimes the randomness of life scares me. The thought that if I do this, or don’t do that, it can change my destiny for better or worse. My life sometimes seems out of control, careening through time and space, heading toward that final frontier.
I’ve always had this insatiable curiosity as to what makes me, me. Why are my thoughts, fears, joys and sorrows, and life’s experiences inside this particular body, living this unique life, in this specific place?
In opposition to the scary thought of where the path of life is taking me is the comfort of what I consider to be my master plan. This isn’t just based on my decisions, but on my destiny. This isn’t to say that I don’t think my decisions are important anymore, in fact, I think they are crucial. But somehow, it seems that when I reach a crossroad, I choose the path that is right for me.
All my heavy thinking didn’t help me go back to sleep. So, just like other “older” people I used to shake my head at, I was up before dawn. A few cups of coffee, and I was good to go.
I wonder if today will bring one of those life changing decisions, or will it be merely another forgettable day? I may not know that answer for years—or I may know it by sundown.
April was a busy month and the first week of May was more of the same. On May Day, I went to the Lodge of the Four Seasons to spend time with some of the most inspiring women I have ever had the pleasure to add to my circle of friends. Business Women of Missouri are focused on improving life for all women, but especially those who are struggling. I am proud to be part of a group that focuses on legislation to help women, scholarships, collecting personal care products for women’s shelters…everywhere you looked, women shared ideas, hugs, and helping hands.
My friend, Nancy, has served as the state president for the past year. As part of Nancy’s team, I learned just how complex planning a conference can be. Fortunately, we had capable leaders who were able to crunch the numbers to find that, indeed, we could meet our obligation. They dared to break the mold and try some new ideas. Because of this, our Saturday morning program included two dynamic, and inspiring, speakers.
Nancy finished her term as president and turn the reins over to Sherry whose theme is “Dare to Inspire and to Be Inspired.” Inspiration—the word comes from the same Latin root word as respiration, spirare, which means “to breathe.” Inspiration makes me feel alive.
Today has been both a sad day and an inspiring day. This morning, the sun was shining and a breeze provided a perfect day for being outdoors. The day started with setting tomato and pepper plants into the earth, with the promise of fresh produce later in the summer.
It was still early when I headed toward Versailles to a memorial for a lovely lady who left this earth too soon. Loretta had asked two family members to speak at her services. Both spoke of how inspiring and life-changing their relationship with Loretta had been. There’s no better legacy to leave than to be a positive influence on others.
Afterwards, my mom, sister, brother, and sister-in-law went out to lunch. As is typical in a small town, the place was filled with people we knew. When my aunt and uncle came in, we squeezed together to make room at the table for them. The conversation was lively, filled with humor. I was sitting at a table with people who inspire me. Then, more cousins/aunts (our family is complicated because my dad’s cousins married my mom’s brothers). It was heartening to spend some time with people I’ve known my entire life. Inspiring.
My day ended with board members of our local Business Women’s Club. Once again, I sat at a table with caring women whom I admire and am inspired by. These women give generously of their time and talents.
As we said our goodbyes, shared hugs and encouragement, I walked out of the restaurant thinking I would jump in my car and head home. It had been a long day. Instead, I decided to walk across the street and look at the veteran’s bricks I had purchased in honor of Jim and my dad.
The evening breeze whipped the eternal flame. Suddenly, I realized how beautiful the evening, and how inspiring the tributes to those who dared to lay their lives on the line for our country. The names on memorials and the rows of bricks were evidence of sacrifice and commitment. I wandered down the sidewalk reading the names. I saw one inscribed with a date when a life was lost in the Philippines. Sad, but inspiring.
I walked around snapping pictures of this familiar landmark, that had suddenly taken on a special atmosphere. I was the only person on the courthouse lawn. Had that ever happened before? What a perfect evening. What a great day to be alive, and appreciate those who died so that I could walk around the courthouse on a peaceful May evening. The breeze, the very breath of inspiration, ruffled my hair, caressed my skin, and filled my heart with hope and happiness, as I dared to be inspired.

Hey, I’ve been reading a new book! It’s called The Real Rules of Life, by Ken Druck. The author is actually a Doctor, and he’s got a lot to say. After losing a 21-year-old daughter in a car accident in 1996, Dr. Druck began a journey that so many parents suffer. He lost pretty much everything: wife, home, pets, and then his other daughter moved out to pursue her own life.
As a result, and after a lot of suffering and learning, Dr. Druck set out to write this book. It’s intended to help people through tough times, and to manage life in general.
For example, Rule #7 is There Are No Quick Fixes: It Takes What It Takes To Mend. In that chapter, the author discusses how uncomfortable we can be if someone takes longer to grieve or process a situation than we’d like. Rather than allow that person the space they need, we tend to push for a quick fix. That’s not the best way to help a loved one who’s hurting.
There are 23 Real Rules in this book, which is intended not to be read through all at once. Rather, the chapters are stand-alone essays that can be read as needed.
As a person who thrives on reality and honesty, I find a lot to like about this book. Back when I was teaching special ed., I frequently was confronted by students who were angry about being placed in my class. Specifically, they were upset about being in special ed. in the first place. The thing was, they’d each been in special ed for years. My point was this: you’re here. You can spend a lot of energy being angry about what happened years ago, or you can DO something to change it. And hint: being mad about the past isn’t going to help you shape the future.
I like that this book lays things out as they really are in life. We all like to sugar coat and avoid reality…even me. But the truth is that life can be hard. This book aims to help people through difficult times by being honest about how hard it really is.
My only hesitation is that the author appears to operate from a non-faith standpoint. For me, trying to manage life without my faith would be…empty. And beyond difficult. I cannot imagine even attempting to function without that facet of my life. But that’s me. Even without that very important factor, the book is still valuable and a worthwhile read.
FTC disclosure: I was given a free copy of this book to read and review. I do recommend it, given the caveat that including God in the picture makes life better.

You can also market your ebook on your own website or blog, particularly if the site gets good traffic. Still another method is affiliate marketing. You can offer to pay sites related to your ebook a percentage of the sale price – say, anywhere between 20% and 50% – for them to post an ad or linked article for your book on their site. This could enable you to market your ebook on multiple platforms for greater market exposure.
No matter what method you end up using to generate an income on the web, you need to adjust your mindset to help empower you rather than discourage you. The truth?

The trick? Cancel the noise and get to the real meat and potatoes, so to speak.

Research other listings in your city on AirBnB and see what the going rate is for a place like yours. You could also just rent out a private room as well or even a bed in a shared room. In fact, that's how AirBnB got its start. However, you might find it hard in the beginning without reviews, but as long as you take really good care of your guests and provide a lot of value, the reviews will eventually come rolling in.
Multi-vendor marketplaces, like ThemeForest, can be very successful. Chose a niche and create a vendor website for it. Your marketplace could be anything, from a platform for local artists to sell their work on, to an online digital product store. Once set up, invite people in that industry to sell their products on your site. You take a percentage of their profits when items sell.
Now, I know what you’re thinking. Most of the software and apps you use on a regular basis are made by massive companies or established development studios. Well, yes. But many successful apps, particularly those in the Apple and Google stores, are created and marketed by individuals and small businesses. In fact, independent developers made $20 billion in the App Store in 2016 alone.

You can earn above average rates of return because peer-to-peer lending eliminates the bank function. That means that you participate in nearly the entire interest rate being paid by the borrower, rather than the less than 1% that you will typically earn on certificates of deposit. And you can reduce your risk by investing in slices of hundreds of different loans.
The top of every guide to what to see in Iceland starts with a day trip from Reykjavik called “The Golden Circle.” It’s a round trip that takes about 3 hours or so of driving, but much more time out of the car looking at stuff. There’s a lot of stuff. It’s pretty good stuff, too.
So after starting the day with some excellent pastries and coffee, we hopped in our rental car and set off. There’s two options for the first leg of the drive, and we took the gravel road for more scenic views and less traffic. It seemed to work. There was quite a bit of scenery:
We got out of the car a few times and just marveled at the landscape, occasionally hiking up into the rocks to fail to find a geocache or two. But who cares when you have these views?
Eventually, we rejoined the main road and made our first official Golden Circle stop – the volcanic crater at Kerið. (In case you’re wondering, ‘ð’ is a “voiced alveolar non-sibilant fricative.” So there you are.) It took about 20 minutes to walk around the whole perimeter. Not for the only time this trip, Leigh took the appearance of this striking piece of geology as proof that the Earth is trying to kill us.
We still had a little time before our lunch reservations, so we visited the church at Skálholt. Skálholt was the center of power for the Bishops of Iceland for rather a long time, until the Reformation. The bishop and his sons, were understandably, not really interested in being reformed, so they were put to death. There’s a memorial stone here, as well as a set of excavations of one of the many prior churches on the site.
One o’clock, and it was time for lunch! We had made reservations at a tomato greenhouse. I’m not quite sure how they managed it, but the owners of this greenhouse have parlayed themselves into a tourist attraction. You sit among rows of tomato plants, and eat all you can snarf tomato soup and bread. There’s also a pot of basil on your table with a pair of scissors for dismantling said basil into your soup.

My name is Sarah, and I’m a 10-year-old gymnast from Spring, Texas. I love everything about gymnastics – the practices, conditioning, team culture, competitions and medals … just about everything! Well, aside from the injuries. Turns out, one minor injury would send me to multiple physicians and physical therapists and cut my gymnastics activities short for an entire year.
Mid-way through my first season of competitive gymnastics, I injured my knee during a competition. After the vault rotation, my knee just didn’t feel right. It wasn’t an intense, sharp pain, but it...

Much of today’s youth are subject to topics around mental health. It’s unavoidable – these discussions fill our news feeds, our schools, our communities and sometimes our own families. This is often a touchy subject, and many caregivers express discomfort and timidity in finding ways to talk about such heavy feelings and emotions with younger children. However, research shows there is no specific age or timeline for these discussions. Some even say the sooner we talk about mental health, the more informed our children...
My name is Ella, and I’m 16 years old. I’m a writer, photographer, artist, Christian and much more. I also have a genetic disorder called Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, or EDS.

EDS is a group of connective tissue disorders with the ability to affect many parts of the body. It’s currently classified into 13 subtypes. In my case, I have severe hypermobile EDS (hEDS). Some of the symptoms I manage on a daily basis include chronic...

The Tale of your Exodus is explained to inside the guides of Exodus, Leviticus, Figures, and Deuteronomy, the final 4 from the 5 publications on the Torah (also referred to as the Pentateuch). It starts Together with the Israelites in slavery. Their prophet Moses leads them away from Egypt and through the wilderness to Mount Sinai, in which Yahweh reveals himself to his people today and establishes the Mosaic covenant: They are really to help keep his torah (i.e. law, instruction), and in return he will provide them with the land of Canaan. The Israelites acknowledge the covenant and get their legislation, and, with Yahweh now existing within their midst, journey on from Sinai, in direction of the promised land, but when told which the land is stuffed with giants they refuse to go on, and Yahweh condemns them to remain during the desert until finally the generation that still left Egypt passes absent.

So I’ve decided to take a break from some stuff and try to really concentrate on the things that make me happy and feel good. So as soon as I have finished my review on Disgaea D2: A Brighter Darkness, I will take a break from writing for PSSverige. I love writing about games, but since I started writing I feel like I’ve enjoyed them a bit less. Probably since it feels more like work than my hobby, which is sad. And going around looking for gaming news also became work, so I sorta fell into a hole.
I just want to enjoy playing game like I used to and not thinking as a reviewer, I had a hard time balancing those thoughts and feelings. So thanks to that feeling like a job too, I grew tired pretty quick. Since I started to feel like I had no free time. It was thought and I’ve had to battle of a few depressions and other anxiety problems. Joel the chief has been nothing but understanding and supportive and I hope I can at least pop up one in a while with a review for the site. I just feel like I can’t be an active member, not right now. But I want to keep supporting the site and I think you should too. Joel is very passionate about PSSverige and I hope it will continue to grow.
So I will not be posting much news anymore either, but who knows in the future when things get better for me or things slow down a bit.
Still I want to give a big shout out to Joel who had given me a chance to do something I’ve dreamt of, thank you. Really man, honestly. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
And this coming weekend I will try to put a new hard drive in my PlayStation 3, so I hope the stuff that went wrong will fix itself. That I can send messages and add people to my friendlist once again. Hoping I’ll be fixing this Friday night or early Saturday. I really hope things will get better there too.

This is my 2nd moped ever. I bought a Puch from Phil Patrie a million years ago and ran it mod stock with a pipe for a while, added a kit and blew it up. Got frustrated and stuck it in a corner of the shop to one day "rebuild" it. That day has come. Added a long seat from a Tri-Rad, chopped and lowered by yours truly to become a "Sport LS" clone. Added a 55 watt H3 halogen headlight along with a CDI and a TrailTech "Dial-A-Brightness" voltage regulator means I have incredibly good light for night rides. The plan is to tear it down this winter and powder-coat the frame to the same baby blue and add some glorious 80's Puch decals, clean up the wiring and in general fix a few other things that it needs. Its not done but finally getting it to a riding condition has made me excited about mopeds all over again!

I have the results of the recent survey. In all honesty, I had no idea how beneficial this would be for myself and my business. There were many items that I learned from doing this. This survey will greatly benefit me in bringing my customers what they like.
BIG THANKS to all of you for participating! I had tons of responses, and they were all taken seriously. All of you obviously put some thought into this. This is exactly what I needed to get a view of my business from outside my bubble.
I would like to address some items that came up, give some general updates, and outline some changes that will or have occurred as a result..
The biggest item that I received feedback upon is that it’s not easy to find custom materials. I have been hosting everything on FlickR, and some people find this difficult.
I’m going to give some consideration as to whether I continue to use FlickR to host my photos. In the meantime, I’ll give some strategies that I think some people are not aware of that make FlickR much easier to navigate.
A. I realize that there are lot of photos on FlickR. When you go to my main Flickr page here, look in the upper-right hand side of the page. You will see a search field that says "Search Edisonpenco’s Photostream" by typing in "ebonite", you will see every pen in my photostream that is made of ebonite. If you type in "green" you will see every pen that has green in the title. If you type in "celluloid" you will see every pen that is made from celluloid. You get the idea. By using this search field, you can go to the FlickR site with any composition, color, or any restriction at all, and narrow things down to your particular tastes.
B. You do not need to sit on my website and wait on a slideshow to see my material choices. Actually, leaving my site and going to FlickR is best. You can visit this link to see all models of my pens. From there, you will see thumbnails. And then every photo has a description so that you can tell what the material is.
The responses about continuing higher end pens, as well as offering lower end production pens were split evenly. Some people were very negative about going with a lower end production model. They felt that I should only go higher and higher. Then some people were the exact opposite.
The high end line will continue with Ernest at Hakumin Urushi as Limited Editions, and also custom one-off’s. There will also be some other high end offerings that will be announced later. However, I will also begin to offer a production pen. It will probably be made in only three materials, and will be less expensive. No customization. There will also be a better rollerball option that will be priced lower.
The biggest concern that people had, however, is stretching myself too far…focus on one or the other, or something will suffer. I will have no problem doing both, and also keeping the same customer service and product quality. The production pens are easier to make, since it’s the same materials, and I can operate it like an assembly line. It’s easier and faster to make 20 identical pens in production style than it is to make only 5 completely custom pens. I’m not changing the quality of product in any way on the production pens. It’s simply much faster to line up each operation and do them repeatedly. Once the lathe is set up to make one type of finial, for example, I can make lots quickly. With a custom pen, I need to do a completely different set up for each part, which consumes a lot of time. Lastly, my 5 year-old is in pre-school three days a week now, so my wife has a lot more time to help me with administrative work, shipping, and other production needs.
I’m taking this very seriously. I will continue my holiday raffle of a free pen, but I will also consider holiday specials, and also summer specials.
A lot of people appreciate the Grande models of the Herald and Huron, but obviously this is going in the opposite direction of people who want smaller pens. There is a smaller pen in the works. It will use a #5 nib. The exact time to market is yet to be determined.
I had a lot of comments to have some overlay options. I’m actually already at the prototype stage on a phenomenal overlay pen. Keep you ear to the ground. This should be out within a month, I hope.
People that made these comments probably haven’t ordered a pen for a while. About 6-9 months ago, I found some nice leatherette boxes for shipping pens. Since then, I recently had some pretty phenomenal presentation boxes arrive, which you can see here…..
One comment based on the survery results….If you aren’t happy with your pen for whatever reason, PLEASE LET ME KNOW! The finer qualities of fountain pens are very user-defined and individual. It’s impossilble to manufacture a pen that will appeal to all. If your nib isn’t what you expected, LET ME KNOW! I’ll take care of it.
To conclude, I would like to again thank everyone for participating in the survey. Everyone took it seriously, and this really helps me to make the right moves with Edison. I really like to be in touch with my clients, and this really helped a lot. Maybe I’ll do one of these surveys annually to serve as an "Edison Check-Up".
HOLLY FIRFER, CNN ANCHOR: I'm Holly Firfer at the CNN Center in Atlanta. We want to take you now live to Baghdad for a coalition briefing with Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt and coalition spokesman Dan Senor. Let's take a listen.
DAN SENOR, CPA SPOKESMAN: Good afternoon. I just have one very quick announcement, and then General Kimmitt will have an opening briefing, and then we will be happy to take your questions.
We -- Ambassador Bremer, over the last several days has issued a statement and is encouraging everyone here to be vigilant in this time during the Arbaeen period, about possible terrorist attacks that could occur in this country. And while there are many other issues that we are all dealing with and attending to, be they in Fallujah or in the southern part of the country, we should not -- we should not be distracted from the very real possibility that a terror attack can occur in this country.
The sorts of attacks we've seen over recent months which we believe to have been orchestrated by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, specifically targeted at Shia holy places. Of course, there was this document which we obtained in which Mr. Zarqawi lays out his battle plan for Iraq, which we obtained several months ago, in which he says and I quote, "They, the Shia, are the insurmountable obstacle, the lurking snake, the crafty, malicious scorpion, the spying enemy and the penetrating venom. The unhurried observer and inquiring onlooker will realize that Shiaism is the looming danger and the true challenge. They are the enemy, beware of them, fight them, by God they lie."
Then he goes on to take responsibility for a number of operations, terrorist attacks, that have occurred in Iraq dating back to last summer. Certainly the one we have in mind, foremost in our mind was the attack in Najaf. And obviously, the ones recently around the time of Ashura (ph). So again, we will repeatedly remind all Iraqis the importance of being vigilant, being very aware of this very real threat that faces Iraqis and specifically many of the religious Shia during this time.
BRIG. GEN. MARK KIMMITT, U.S. ARMY: Good afternoon. What I would like to do is I did in fact two days ago is give a quick orientation to the entire area of operations, to give -- and try to give a perspective of what is going on in the overall theater. I want to talk about a couple of the towns, and I'll take you through a quick orientation of the areas that you're hearing about and try to put in your mind an idea between the map and those places you're reading about.
Here is the town of Fallujah. Right here is the small suburb of Abu-Gareb (ph). There has been some fighting in vicinity of Abu-Gareb (ph) today, and parts of the lines of communication were cut, right along this route, coming out of Baghdad to Fallujah. And we currently have active ongoing operations by the 1st Armored Division and the 1st Cavalry Division in that area to open up that route.
In Fallujah, the unilateral suspension of military operations announced about 48 hours ago by coalition forces is continuing to be maintained on the parts of the Marines. There has been sporadic fighting by the enemy forces. The enemy forces in some cases are attacking, in some cases just taking pot shots. We don't know if they have not got a centralized command structure which is causing them not to understand that there is an offer on the table for a cease-fire, or if they are continuing to fight by their own volition.
Nonetheless, it is the intent of the coalition to continue to allow the Interim Governing Council to come into the town of Fallujah so that we can talk and the Governing Council can talk about prospects of restoring governmental control to the city of Fallujah.
Of course you know the town of Baghdad. Baghdad has been quiet for the last 48 hours. There have been individual activities, small, localized engagements. There were some pictures shown I think about 24 hours ago, suggesting that the Americans had withdrawn, the coalition forces had withdrawn from Sadr City. The fact remains is that in the estimation of the ground commander, Sadr City is back in Iraqi control. We have Iraqi personnel in the police stations. The Sadr building was destroyed. We don't see -- even though there has been some slight rebuilding of it, we don't see a significant Sadr militia presence in Sadr City. Around the city, of course, today we've had a couple of explosion. But -- and, however, 1st Armored Division, 1st Cavalry Division estimate that Baghdad is still fully under Iraqi control.
As we head to the south, there are the towns that you have read and heard about, Al-Kut, Diwaniya, Karbala, Najaf, and Nasiriya. Of course further in the south are the larger towns, in Dekar (ph) province, Basra, so on and so forth.
But let me focus on these towns. In Al-Kut, we continue to maintain coalition presence. There was some method and some manner of Sadr control over the city for a small period of time. We brought in 2-6 (ph) Infantry as I described yesterday, came across the bridges, attacked into the town, and the vast majority of the town of Al-Kut is back in coalition hands. It is clear that the people of Al-Kut appreciate the coalition presence. Although many of the people, most of the people are staying inside their houses, it is clear that at this point that the ground combat units are now moving from the notion of re-establishing Iraqi control to the city of Al-Kut, to now going to the next phase, which is bringing in the information, bringing in the dollars, bringing in the assets so that all the destruction, what minor destruction there was done, we can start rebuilding that and convince the people of Al-Kut that the purpose of coalition control and Iraqi control is to bring them one step closer to sovereignty and democracy.
The same thing in the town of Nasiriya. Nasiriya currently has significant Italian patrols, the Italian REFT (ph) brigade in control of the entire city. We would suspect that in both Kut and in Nasiriya that there are small bands of Sadr militia that may be hiding out, holding out. However, the contact has been negligible in both these towns. There may be some operations upcoming in both these towns. And as we conduct intel-based raids to go out and clean up the remaining pockets.
Same idea in An-Nasiriya. Now that the fighting is over, we want to get back to the process of rebuilding, building structures, building confidence, and getting those towns back on the path to democracy and sovereignty.
We have talked about Diwaniya. Diwaniya, again, is quiet, and right now the remaining presence of significant Sadr militia seems to be in the towns of Karbala and Najaf. They are mixed in with the pilgrims that are observing Arbaeen. At this point, we don't want to go into those cities. We do have forces on the outskirts of both those cities. As and when necessary, as and when it makes sense, we will re-establish coalition control over those towns, re-establish Iraqi control over those towns.
So as you look at the overall area of operations, things are improving. In the south, particularly as we are now starting to, well, finishing the destruction of the Sadr militia. The Sadr militia has gone to ground in many of these towns. They are no longer an active offensive threat.
They will be a threat for some time to come. The coalition forces certainly have the capability to maneuver forces anywhere in the country necessary to finish the destruction of the Sadr militia as long as it remains a threat to the people of Iraq and the progress of Iraq.
In Fallujah, the discussions continue with the enemy inside Fallujah. We are now looking for the political track to be the method by which we re-establish Iraqi control over the city of Fallujah, get legitimate Iraqi authority over that city, not extremist control of that city.
There are small pockets of resistance and activities, such as we're seeing along route Campa (ph) and some of the other areas, but the coalition remains confident that as these threats crop up, they have the maneuver capability, the force capability and the intelligence capability to minimize those threats.
So given what we see right now on the ground, subject to new intelligence coming in, the assessment of the coalition and the Iraqi authorities is that they are making progress and trying to get back to the most important aspect, which is to move the political process forward, move the process of handing governance over.
There have been tremendous small unit engagements, and I want to take about three minutes to give you a flavor of the kind of operations that your soldiers have been engaging. This one is in a small town of Baquba, which is our assessment that the former regime elements that were operating in Baquba saw this recent activity in the case of Fallujah and in the south as an opportunity to raise some trouble. And this is what they found.
At 2:00 p.m. on Friday, the Baquba police station, the governor's building and the civil military operation center were simultaneously attacked by armed insurgents. At least 15 rocket grenades were reported being fired at the police station.
FIRFER: Good morning. You're watching CNN SUNDAY MORNING. We're live in Baghdad at a coalition forces briefing. Brigadier General Mark Commit is at the microphone.
KIMMITT: ... mortars were observed impacting near the civil military operation center. Two Iraqi police were killed during the attack on the police station. Two U.S. soldiers were wounded. And between 3:30 and 4:00, there was a brief lull in enemy contact. At 4:00, contact increased again.
At 4:45, while moving from (UNINTELLIGIBLE) to clear, an armed enemy -- a coalition force was ambushed by enemy elements of unknown size. Reports indicate at least 20 rocket grenades were observed during the course of the engagement. Forty to 50 armed individuals were observed, some wearing black pajamas, uniforms, others wearing civilian clothes.
Coalition forces returned fire, killing at least 20. And during the course of the engagement, a rocket grenade impacted with the turret of one of the infantry fighting vehicles, injuring the gunner. And en route to his forward operating base, that gunner died.
At 6:10, coalition forces were again engaged by at least six rocket-propelled grenades and an unknown number of Iraqis firing from allies. Continuous enemy contact was reported from a traffic circle. And by 8:30, up to 100 personnel armed with rocket grenades and small arms were reported in the vicinity of the traffic circle.
Coalition forces established positions through the north of the circle and to the east of the circle, and conducted an assault to clear remnants of enemy contact and establish blocking positions on the bridges. During movement to the bridges, forces were engaged by at least six rocket-propelled grenade teams and small arms fire. But by 10:30, coalition elements were again established at the twin bridges. By 10:40 that evening, forces completed repositioning of forces to the governor's building; enemy contact was light throughout the remainder of the night.
So although these engagements have been sporadic, and in a countrywide analysis they have been limited, the fact is, we have coalition soldiers out there every day fighting a determined enemy, fighting an enemy that wants to reverse the course of where this country's going to go. And some are paying the ultimate price for the freedom of this country. And for that, the coalition remains grateful.
DANIEL COONEY, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS: Daniel Cooney from The Associated Press. We had a report that U.S. forces have ordered pilgrims out of Karbala. Can you comment on that?
NICK RICCARDI, LOS ANGELES TIMES: Nick Riccardi, Los Angeles Times. I have two questions. The first one is mainly clerical.
General Commit, when you say -- when you've said Iraqi control in describing the situation, is that a synonym that you're using for coalition control?
KIMMITT: It is a synonym for legitimate control in this country, which is represented by both the Iraqi authorities and the Coalition Provisional Authority.
KIMMITT: As opposed to Sadder militia, as opposed to former regime elements, as opposed to anybody who doesn't respect the 25 million people of Iraq.
RICCARDI: And my second question is, the situation in Fallujah, you're now seeking a political track. Has the -- what changed in the course of the military operation to make the coalition decide that the political solution is the one that should be pursued right now?
SENOR: I would just say we have been approached by a number of Iraqi political leaders, members of the Governing Council, who indicated to us that after the initial hostilities in the initial operations in Fallujah, there was an opportunity for them, if given a clear passage into Fallujah, to try to minimize the bloodshed. And we believed it prudent to give them the opportunity to do so. We are now waiting to see where that goes. It's really at its initial stages.
QUESTION (through translator): Al-Arabiya television reported that Peshmerga or Kurdish forces have worked with the coalition forces in the Fallujah. How much truth into this?
KIMMITT: There's no truth that Peshmerga militia worked in the area of Fallujah. Anyone who is operating in the vicinity of Fallujah is either a member of the coalition force or an Iraqi Civil Defense Corps unit. That Iraqi Civil Defense Corps unit serving the nation of Iraq, serves the people of Iraq, and swears its loyalty to the people of Iraq.
General Kimmitt, could you comment on two reports we've been hearing today? One about at least one helicopter being downed in west of Baghdad. And, secondly, could you give us an update on the two American service members who are missing in action? Could you tell us what unit they're from, what efforts are being made to locate them or ascertain their whereabouts?
KIMMITT: As we reported earlier, there was an A-64 helicopter brought down by enemy fire today at about 11:05, approximately five kilometers west of Baghdad International Airport. I'm sad to report that the pilots have been declared killed in action.
We have a quick reaction force on site conducting the recovery of the equipment and personnel. And our hearts go out to the families that tonight will be getting that message. And we'll pray for them.
KIMMITT: We have no soldiers currently listed as missing in action. We have two soldiers whose duty status is unknown. And as we find out further information on that, we will keep you updated on that.
QUESTION: And as a quick follow-up, sir, there was another report that apparently just went over the wires about another helicopter being downed. Have you heard about that?
First, do you have any reports about two Marines that were shot by a sniper in Fallujah or the surrounding area? And the second question is, speaking with a senior member of the IGC yesterday, he said to us that the -- what's happening in Fallujah has caused a considerable amount of damage in the trust and confidence of the Iraqi people themselves in the coalition because there was excessive force, in this person's opinion. My question is, how then do you now move forward and try to repair that relationship? Is it possible? What are the methods you'll take?
KIMMITT: Yes. On the first question, we understood there may be some reports coming up that indicate some Marine casualties today. I don't yet have those reports. As soon as we have them, we will pass them out.
And one part of your question about excessive force, that again -- I think what we need to repair is a press that will continue to try to manipulate the facts when the vast majority of the facts on ground disprove those opinions. The forces out in Fallujah have been tremendously precise, tremendously circumspect, well within the rules of engagement, and have not engaged in any violations of the laws of war nor the rules of engagement.
SENOR: Rachel (ph), I would just add on your second question, the decision-making process we go through when we consider operations like in Fallujah, like against Saddler's militia, are based on what kind of setback would occur if we don't confront those elements. What we have to think about is there are individuals or organizations in Fallujah that mutilate individuals and just engage in sort of mob violence. And certainly the mob violence that we have to -- that we've observed in the southern part of the country with Saddler's militia and the violent intimidation tactics used to try to achieve through the barrel of a gun what these -- what Sadder and his militia knows they could never achieve at a ballot box.
Now, we have to consider, if you do not confront those forces head on, what does that say, what does that mean, what kind of roadblocks does it create for Iraq's path to democracy, for Iraq's path to sovereignty? And we make the calculation that it is better to combat and confront that cancer, that poison in Iraq's body politic now rather than down the road.
We have no reason to believe that it is a problem that would be minimized by waiting, by turning our heads. When the sort of violence -- the mob violence that has run rampant in certain parts of the country is left unchecked, it is not going to go away if we choose to ignore it. And that certainly, we believe, would pose much larger problems down the road for Iraq's path to democracy than just ignoring it now.
QUESTION: Can I just -- one follow-up. Was the IGC consulted before you had drawn up plans to go into Fallujah?
SENOR: I don't want to comment on our planning process, certainly on the operational side. I can let General Kimmitt speak to that. But I can say the Governing Council has been in very constructive discussions with Ambassador Bremer over the past few days on seeking some sort of resolution. Certainly the talks about organizing a cessation of hostility has had the deep involvement of members of the Iraqi Governing Council.
First, for General Kimmitt, I've heard you speak from the podium for several days now about the precise limited nature of the Marine actions there. Also seen wire reports from inside the city with very large reports of civilian casualties. Do the Marines have an estimate as to the number of civilians and Iraqi combatants who have been killed as a result of the actions there? It would be helpful to get some sort of estimate from your side.
And the second question, Dan, assuming that the cease-fire is agreed to, or some sort of temporary cessation of hostility hostilities, what are the coalition's conditions for a permanent cessation of hostilities? What do you want from the leadership of Fallujah so that this issue can be revolved?
SENOR: I think it's premature, Rajiv (ph), to get to that stage, conditions, permanent cease-fire. We are at a very, very preliminary phase.
We are allowing -- we are trying to suspend hostility is so that Iraqi Governing Council delegation can get in and out of Fallujah easily, to have discussion with Fallujah leaders. Once we get comfortable with that phase, we can talk about the nature of those discussions that could lead to perhaps something more permanent and the conditions that you're referencing. But we're just not there yet.
We're trying to get access for the delegation. We're trying to get the fighting to stop. We're trying to minimize the bloodshed. And then we will go from there.
KIMMITT: And as to the figures that you're seeking, I would recommend you go talk to the Marines. I think they can give you a much better estimate of the numbers there.
But I think when you do talk to them, make sure that you talk to them about what was the reason any of those casualties occurred. Was it because of Marine tactics, or was it because, more probably, of an enemy who's trying to wrap himself in the civilian population, among the civilian population, as human shields, as barriers, as an attempt to draw them into the fight, when by international law they are technically considered noncombatants.
And I think before we suggest where the blame lies, would recommend you go out there and take a look and see for yourself the type of enemy that will fire from a mosque, that will shoot its mortars from a mosque, will try to kill coalition soldiers from a mosque. And then when a portion of the outer wall of the mosque complex is then destroyed in order to stop the shooting that was killing coalition soldiers, will then proclaim from that same mosque about the war crimes of the coalition forces. The answer ought to be obvious. SENOR: Go ahead.
QUESTION (through translator): General Kimmitt, the delegation that went to Fallujah have returned. I have communicated with the head of the delegation, and he informed me that there was an agreement with the resistance to crease operations. But they were demanding that American forces should retreat from Fallujah when the city will be given to Iraqi police and Iraqi army. Do you agree with that condition?
My second question, if you have accepted the idea of doing dialoguing with Fallujah, are you going to be dialoguing with Najaf? Or are you providing the same condition for Najaf to do this or to become an Iraqi situation to be dealt with by Iraqis?
KIMMITT: I don't think that I want to stand up here and comment on the positions of both sides. The coalition side on Fallujah is simple.
We have been on a unilateral suspension of offensive operations for about 52 hours now. Yesterday, we called for a unilateral -- a bilateral cease-fire. We did not ascribe any conditions to that; we did not place any conditions on that. Now the persons have come back and started putting conditions on that.
I think the most important thing to understand at this point is that the coalition forces have suspended offensive operations. They are permitting the political track and the discussion track to go forward. They will always retain the inherent right of self-defense, and they will be prepared if the discussions break down to continue offensive operations. In terms of the tick-tock as it goes back and forth in the discussions, I think I'll leave that to the Governing Council to discuss that with other coalition officials.
QUESTION: (UNINTELLIGIBLE). You've been talking about the suspension of offensive operation, but you have not been talking about the cease-fire that went into effect this morning. What happened this morning?
KIMMITT: Well, again, the cease-fire would indicate that both sides have agreed to it. Certainly, we would ask the enemy to suspend their offensive operations. We would ask the enemy to stop their operations as well.
KIMMITT: There are no terms. We have unilaterally suspended offensive operations. If the enemy were to unilaterally suspend offensive operations or any of their operations, then we would have a cease-fire on the ground. QUESTION: The second question is about you haven't talked much about the humanitarian situation in Fallujah. Could you describe it for us and tell us what the Marines are doing to...
KIMMITT: The Marines remain ready, willing and able at any time to provide any level of humanitarian assistance. Outside the city of Fallujah, I understand they've already set up facilities for any displaced persons that come out of the city that need assistance. That is something that the Marine Corps is expert in, the whole notion of assistance, rendering assistance to any town in the world at anytime.
We've got to get to the conditions of stability so that they can provide that. The Iraqi government has already provided some supplies to them as well. We are not aware of any appeal on the part of anyone inside of the Fallujah -- the city of Fallujah for any additional supplies. I am certain that the Marines, if asked by a legitimate authority to provide and render humanitarian aid or any aid to people, particularly noncombatants that need it, I think they would probably find a very open dialogue to provide that.
You have stated that you have allowed the political track that you see to go to Fallujah. And then, at the same time, you say that from unilateral position that you have stopped the work. Are you going to play a role? You have allowed it, but then you have stopped the cease-fire.
Then, the second question to General Kimmitt. From here, from this podium, you talk about a clean war in Fallujah. But the Iraqis have an image through television from what is happening in Fallujah from killing children. Is there a way that you could convince Iraqis by your point of view that you have utilized force against terrorists?
KIMMITT: With regards to the solution on the images of Americans and coalition soldiers killing innocent civilians, my solution is quite simple: change the channel. Change the channel to a legitimate, authoritative, honest news station.
The stations that are showing Americans intentionally killing women and children are not legitimate news sources. That is propaganda, and that is lies. So you want a solution? Change the channel.
SENOR: I mean, you, yourself, cited Al-Jazeera. And we've noticed a real trend with Al-Jazeera and Al-Arabiya and some of the other channels that are -- what we believe are misreporting facts on the ground and contributing to a sense of anger and frustration that possibly should be directed at individuals and organizations inside of Fallujah that mutilate Americans and slaughter other Iraqis rather than at the coalition.
To your other question, our goal is quite simple. It is to minimize bloodshed. We were approached by members of the Iraqi Governing Council who wanted to organize a delegation to head into Fallujah to try to work towards some sort of discussion here. And in so doing, would require a suspension of hostilities.
And we are acting on that. We are suspending hostilities to allow the delegation to get peacefully inside Fallujah and begin those talks with Fallujah leaders. That is our goal.
QUESTION (through translator): My question to General Kimmitt. How many helicopters have you lost since the beginning of hostilities in Fallujah until now?
Second, some channels showed two people that have been murdered. They stated that they are CIA officials. How much truth to that?
Now, you are putting your -- your forces in front of Fallujah and you are ceasing fire. Is this a tactical approach so that you could continue your operation later?
KIMMITT: On the first question, in terms of the number of helicopters that we have lost during this operation, I talked about one Apache today. I know that we've had a couple of others do precautionary and emergency landings over the space of the last few days. But in terms of total losses, I don't think we have had one today and possibly one two days ago. I would have to check and see if it was a total loss or just a partial loss.
With regards to the persons who were shown on the TV today who were apparently murdered, I can't answer who they were. I can't answer what organization because I simply don't know.
And in terms of the positioning of the forces in Fallujah, quite simply, these were positions that coalition forces fought for, some died for. But they've accomplished those positions, and they're not giving up those positions until a decision is made with regards to a final determination on how we're going to get legitimate Iraqi control back into the city of Fallujah so that we have Iraqi police governing that city, Iraqi governmental officials making decisions for that city, Iraqi civil defense marching up and down that city.
But with regards to why the Marines are there, because they fought for those, they bled for those, and, in some cases, they died for those positions. And they don't give up ground that easy. Second, if the talks break down, and the enemy continues to attack, those will be very good positions from which the Marines can continue the attack to finish taking the town of Fallujah.
JIM CLANCY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I want to follow up a little bit if I can on a question my colleague over here asked. And that is about the future. And we know a conflict could be coming in Najaf. And I'm sure, General Kimmitt, you know that urban warfare, as careful as anybody is, civilians are going to get killed.
There's a city where you're trying to win hearts and minds. Certainly the Shia, south. Everything you said about al-Sadr and the Mehdi Army would say it's an isolated problem. But, Dan Senor, is there a need here for the Iraqi leadership working with the CPA to start talking to the people in that city right now to solve that problem? Is that under way?
SENOR: Let me say this, Jim. We -- what we're seeing in Najaf and other parts of the south central region is Sadr's militia taking over police stations, intimidating Iraqi police officers, taking over government buildings, shutting down schools, murdering their fellow Iraqi citizens.
The majority of Iraqis even in the south central region of the country, the silent majority, if you will, are communicating to us and through our channels that they don't want a part of Sadr's militia. They don't want a part of this sort of thuggery and mob violence. And we believe we have a responsibility here to address it.
Now, by addressing it, do you run the risk of there being civilian casualties and pain and suffering imposed upon the local citizens, regional organizations, regional institutions? That's a risk in any military conflict. It's a risk in any operation you engage in.
But what's the alternative? And that's the question we have to ask ourselves. And this isn't to suggest that we are -- and I'll let General Kimmitt speak to planning our preparations for additional operations or holding back on operations. But I will just say that -- and this comes back to Rachel's (ph) question -- in all these situations, we have to ask ourselves, what is the risk of not acting? What is the risk of turning our head and just ignoring this problem?
And the risk is not only one of a security nature for the coalition, but is also an enormous risk for the Iraqi people and their ability to build a democracy and their ability move on their path to sovereignty. If we do not address these elements and these individuals and these organizations now, we will the day because these organizations, these militia, will rise up another day. And it's bet tore deal with them now than after June 30.
KIMMITT: And, quite simply, what I would say is that there are many ways for the town of Najaf to come back under legitimate control of the Iraqi government, the Coalition Provisional Authority, and that don't involve any fighting at all. The people of Najaf can certainly turn over the Sadr militia. The people in Najaf can help us in this process. The people in Najaf can restore the Iraqi police to the rightful positions inside their city.
We don't see it as a necessary requirement that any military action has to occur in Najaf. In fact, I think anyone who has ever had to send soldiers into combat would always prefer to have another solution. We look forward to that solution. That solution simply being restoration of Iraqi control, not militia control, but Iraqi control into the city of Najaf and Karbala.
CLANCY: So very briefly, is that a yes, that you are pursuing some other things? There are talks going on in order to head off a conflict if possible?
SENOR: We would prefer there to be no conflict. I'm not going to comment on the sort of operational details. I would say that our goal is to minimize bloodshed and to head off any sort of conflict. But, of course, as I said earlier, we have to consider the alternative to inaction in all these situations if, in fact, there is no -- no track for negotiations.
QUESTION: Yes, hi. Jonathan Steel (ph) from "The Guardian." Two questions to Mr. Senor, first of all.
There have been reports that the family of the assassinated ayatollah wants the arrest warrant for Muqtada al-Sadr lifted or removed. Do you know if that's true? And, if so, are you willing to have that removed?
And, secondly, to General Kimmitt, you talk about changing channels, but what is your reply to people like Adnan Pachachi, who have accused the coalition forces of using collective punishment on the city of Fallujah? Have you got a reply a little bit more nuanced and subtle than just to tell Mr. Pachachi to change channels?
SENOR: On your first question, I've seen the same report and it's erroneous. That has been confirmed to me. And I would say, just at a broader level here, the arrest warrant against Muqtada al-Sadr was issued by an Iraqi investigative judge based on evidence connecting Mr. al-Sadr to the murder of Mr. al-Khoei and two other individuals.
And the Iraqi investigative judge has multiple eyewitnesses that he believes serve as the basis for a very strong case. And he's moving forward with that case.
KIMMITT: And we have great respect for all the members of the Governing Council. Every one of them have different views. We respect all views in this country.
In this case, we can disagree without being disagreeable, but it is not the practice of the coalition forces, any of the coalition nations, to exercise collective punishment or collective action on a city. That is just not done. It is not practiced. And it violates international law. And we don't believe at this point that coalition can be shown any proof to suggest that it is in violation of international law or the laws of land warfare.
SENOR: And I would just add to that, while -- As General Kimmitt said, we don't share Dr. Pachachi's characterization of the situation as collective punishment, I would also add, we have tremendous respect for Dr. Pachachi and the other individuals of the Governing Council in the situations they're in.
They are in touch with their local communities. They are hearing frustrations from their communities. And they feel as Iraqi political leaders an obligation to share those frustrations with us. That's -- we respect that role. It's an important role for them to perform.
What we also respect is that the overwhelming majority of Iraqi Governing Council members are working with us to bring resolution to these issues in a very constructive way. Ambassador Bremer has been meeting regularly with members of the Governing Council, and they've been having very constructive discussions. And so while what's often reported is the one or two sentences of criticism about the way things are being handled, what's not often reported is the extent to which we are having very constructive discussions with these Iraqi political leaders.
QUESTION: Yes. Two quick questions. One for General Kimmitt. Sorry, for General Kimmitt, do you know exactly who you're dealing with in terms of the leadership in Fallujah?
KIMMITT: No. I don't think we really believe that there's a centralized organization that is calling the shots for all of the disparate extremists that are fighting coalition forces in Fallujah.
QUESTION: And the second quick question is, do you know the whereabouts of Muqtada al-Sadr? There's been some reports that he's fled to Iran.
SENOR: I have not heard those reports. Your first question, I will just add, we are deferring to the delegation that is traveling to and from Fallujah to -- to make determinations about who some of the appropriate leaders to deal with, and we are having discussions with them about it. We just have a couple more minutes here. Yes.
QUESTION (through translator): I have two questions. One for Dan Senor, Senator Dan Senor. You said that there is a statement from Ambassador Bremer to be vigilant, to all Iraqis to be vigilant. Have you received any information that assures that the coming days will witness terrorist attack?
The second question to General Kimmitt, you spoke about the city of Najaf and Karbala, which is outside control of the coalition forces, and then what is to be done if there was no real agreement reached, which would happen, and then the militias would return to the authority? Don't you think that a military operation in Najaf and Karbala will intensify the crisis upon the coalition forces?
On your first question, here's what we know. We know that Abu Musab Zarqawi drafted a document that laid out a very clear plan for provoking civil war in this country, central to which was engaging in terrorist attacks against Shia at their religious holy sites and other parts of the country. This was a document we have very good reason was headed to senior al Qaeda leadership outside of Iraq.
We have since all seen or heard the tape in which al Zarqawi lays out further plans, takes responsibility for recent activities inside Iraq, terrorist activities, that are consistent with his messages in the first document we obtained.
We have been aware of other indicators, and I'll leave it at that, other indicators that Mr. Zarqawi may, in fact, be involved with planning further or future terrorist attacks inside this country, and recognizing this period, the Arbaeen period, where you have a large number of Iraqis and citizens of other countries out and about in the streets, engaging in religious pilgrimage and other events, it makes them especially vulnerable to the sorts of the terrorist attacks that Mr. Zarqawi has orchestrated in the past. And so recognizing all this, we are doing our part to be as vigilant as possible, and we are encouraging all Iraqis to be equally vigilant.
KIMMITT: And Basan (ph), to your question about Najaf, we don't see military action as preferable. We don't see military action as inevitable. We seek any resolution and any number of resolutions that would allow, very simply, restoration of legitimate authority into the town of Najaf and Karbala.
QUESTION (through translator): Al-Hurria (ph) Television to Dan Senor and General Kimmitt. For the last statement from President Bush, he said that we are going to provide sovereignty to Iraqis by June 30, and then there is a statement that sovereignty will not be complete. My other question to General Kimmitt, that you are preoccupied on the Iraqi borders. You're stating that there are foreigners who are coming in to cause terrorism, but you are now preoccupied with the interior and other conditions on the borders. Now, doesn't that mean that you are allowing the opportunity for foreigners to penetrate Iraq?
SENOR: On your first question, we are on track to hand sovereignty over to the Iraqi people on June 30. It will be complete sovereignty. Iraqis will have complete political sovereignty in their own country. We will still have a substantial presence here to assist the Iraqis as they work through transition phases in other areas, be it in the reconstruction of their infrastructure, or to deal with their security situation.
We recognize that there will be a significant terror threat in Iraq after June 30. We also recognize that as courageous and as brave as the majority of the Iraqi security forces are, it still will not be -- the security forces will still not be able to defend against the terrorist threat completely on their own. And so there's still going to be a role for security forces here.
You are going to have the largest U.S. embassy here in the world, we're going to be deploying almost $20 billion in reconstruction funds, which has already begun. So we will have a role here, but Iraqi political leaders will be in control of their country. Iraqi political leaders will be in control of their political destiny.
We believe that's very important for a number of reasons. Not the least of which is we often talk up here about confronting the terrorist threat and the threat posed by extremists like Muqtada al- Sadr and his militia, or these former Baathist types that have orchestrated attacks in Fallujah and the surrounding areas. And the military strategy is important, but equally important is a political strategy and an economic strategy, and they all must work in tandem.
That's to say that the more we politically empower the Iraqi people, the more we economically empower the Iraqi people, the more difficult it will be for the terrorist and the extremists and the former Baathists to capitalize on any sense of frustration or a sense of hopelessness. And that is why June 30 is so central to our overall strategy, and we are focused on it.
KIMMITT: I don't think I have anything further to say about the border issue nor the terrorist threat within the country. Clearly, the Iraqi government, the Iraqi security forces, the coalition forces continue to work very hard towards trying to find the terrorist threats and then attack, to kill or capture those terrorists that would attempt to kill Iraqi citizens and coalition forces.
That is an effort we continue even as we have the ongoing pace of operations to destroy the Sadr militia, to bring down the lack of control in Fallujah. We are still continuing those other efforts as well.
That's a job that won't stop as long as the coalition is here, and it's a job that won't stop even after the coalition has left.
FIRFER: You've been listening to a live briefing in Baghdad from coalition forces. We have Brigadier General Mark Kimmitt spoke, and coalition spokesman Dan Senor, running through situations in Iraq and also the Apache helicopter that went down. The AH-64, five kilometers west of Baghdad Airport, both pilots were killed. There's a quick reaction force on site to recover that helicopter now. He says the Fallujah cease-fire is holding and went to a rundown saying where the coalition forces stand.
He seemed a bit out of place his junior season, but in his defense, many Jayhawks were put in hard situations as they struggled to compete. With AP Photos.The Dallas Cowboys have drafted a tight end with Jason Witten on the verge of retirement after 15 seasons.
Vander Esch is a linebacker from Boise State. They needed an offensive tackle who could also play guard and compete for the starting position there at left guard, so they drafted Texas standout Connor Williams.
The first round of the NFL Draft just took place and with the remaining rounds taking place on Friday and Saturday, this is a great weekend for football fans.
After Georgia's Roquan Smith and Virginia Tech's Tremaine Edmunds, Vander Esch was the third linebacker selected in the first round this year. Blake Jarwin, Rico Gathers, and Geoff Swaim all have a combined total of only nine catches.
It was this time past year , at the 2017 Eastern Conference semifinals, when James and the Cavaliers swept the Raptors. The Cleveland Cavaliers have a quick turnaround after beating the Indiana Pacers in a seven game series on Sunday.
All or Nothing: The Michigan Wolverines premiered earlier this month so if you want a double-dose of behind-the-scenes football docs, you are covered with the amateurs and the pros. With Dez Bryant moving on to another team and SMU's Courtland Sutton being drafted 40th overall by Denver, the Cowboys are lacking a prototypical "X" receiver for the first time in roughly a decade.
Williams is a Dallas native and was thrilled to have the opportunity to play for his hometown Cowboys, which was quite evident as he was overcome with emotion in the green room. "I don't think it could have went any better".
Second-round pick Connor Williams is an incredible talent who should have gone in the first round, but injuries hurt his play during the 2017 season. They have one pick in the fifth, three in the sixth and one in the seventh.
Bristol's iconic Whitfield Tabernacle, one of the most at risk Grade One listed buildings in the UK, has taken a big step towards being saved thanks to a partnership between Crossman Homes and the Whitfield Tabernacle Trust.
The Kingswood building, dating back to 1741 and widely regarded as the birthplace of the Methodist movement will, under plans being put forward, be renovated and redeveloped as a community space.
The site, previously owned by PG Group, has lain dormant for many years due to its challenging layout, complicated planning issues and viability concerns. Crossman Homes bought the land adjacent to the Tabernacle from PG Group in May and is planning to convert the existing Masters Church into 19 apartments and erect three new build homes.
The company has pledged to assist in the renovation and rebuilding of the neighbouring derelict burnt out shell of the Whitfield Tabernacle working closely with the Trust which was formed in October 2017.
Speaking after a recent meeting convened by Kingswood MP Chris Skidmore, Simon Ellis, Crossman Homes said: “We’re delighted to be part of this exciting development working closely with the Trust, Chris Skidmore MP and South Gloucestershire Council. Our involvement provides the first realistic proposition that this 'at risk’ Grade One Listed building can be saved from collapse, bringing it back into good use for the community. We’re well placed to tackle this challenging site following our recent successful redevelopment of Wesleyan Chapel in Kingswood, Bristol.”
Crossman Homes is working closely with South Gloucestershire Council planners to unlock the complicated site constraints with a view to delivering 19 apartments within the Masters Church conversion and three new houses on the site. This includes providing a new public park which Crossman Homes will gift back to the Council for locals to use and enjoy.
Chris Skidmore, MP for Kingswood said: "I was delighted to bring both Crossman Homes and the Whitfield Tabernacle Trust together for the first time, in order to begin a dialogue about how to best progress the Tabernacle's restoration. Already Crossman Homes is working on a plan for the Masters Church and the wider site, which should help transform this unloved part of Kingswood, but I am extremely keen as the local MP for Kingswood that we get a viable plan for restoring the Grade One listed Tabernacle that will have the support of the Trust and the local community together, so that we can finally end the situation of a worldwide historic site simply rotting away.
"I hope that this meeting will be the start of a conversation about how we can now move forward together, united behind a common vision of transforming Kingswood for the better, with the Tabernacle a vitally important part of this regeneration process."
Cllr Toby Savage, Leader, South Gloucestershire Council added: “I’ve been really impressed with Crossman Homes’ work on other sites locally, which bodes well for finally unlocking the potential of the Whitfield Tabernacle site to contribute towards an exciting future for Kingswood’s town centre. As a Council, we look forward to examining the specific planning proposals being submitted for this site.”

The FBI says that "gangs are morphing, multiplying, migrating and entrenching themselves in our inner cities, suburbs and rural communities. They are selling drugs to our kids, shooting up our neighborhoods, invading our homes, robbing our banks and stores, stealing our identities, our money, and instilling fear and violence everywhere they go."
They are violent and are responsible for committing crimes from assaults to murder using firearms, machetes, fists and blunt objects to intimidate rivals, law enforcement, and the general public. (4)
They are sprawling our highways, the Internet, and our communities intimidating and infecting all they come in contact with. In some communities, they are responsible for as much as a staggering 80 percent of all crimes. (1)
The National Alliance of Gang Investigators Association (NAGIA) states "The scourge of gangs is a clear and present danger to our internal national security and adversely impacts the quality of life within our communities with violence, drugs and associated criminal activities." (5)
There are about 20,000 violent street, motorcycle and prison gangs in the U.S. today containing approximately one million criminally active members - 147,000 of which are currently incarcerated in federal, state, and local correctional facilities. (2)
While not all gangs are sophisticated and well organized, they all use violence to control neighborhoods and perpetuate their illegal money-making activities. Gangs have also become the primary retail distributors of most illicit drugs. (2)
Gangs continue to pose a serious threat to public safety in many communities throughout the Houston area and the United States.
Gang movement to suburban areas can be attributed to several factors including the breakdown of traditional hierarchical gang structures resulting from law enforcement targeting of gang leaders, an abundance of wholesale illicit drug suppliers, and the expectation of high profits from new suburban drug operations.
Other reasons include an effort to expand the gang's influence, expanding drug distribution territories, recruiting new members, hiding from law enforcement, and escaping other gangs. As a result, many suburban and rural communities are experiencing ever increasing gang-related crime and violence because of expanding gang influence.
The movement of gang members to suburban areas result in territorial conflicts between rival gang members and competition for the new territory - suburbia. As gangs grow regionally and nationally, they will continue to meet with resistance by other gangs possibly resulting in drive-by shootings, homicides and other violent crimes - now in suburban communities.
Gangs maintain their criminal operations and lifestyles primarily through drug distribution. Members typically launder profits from criminal activities through front companies such as clothing stores, beauty salons, and music recording companies. They commingle illicit proceeds earned from drug sales with income from these businesses to pay their living expenses and the purchase of luxury goods such as vehicles and jewelry. They are like pirates - they commit war-like acts and engage in robbery and criminal violence as a means to sustain themselves. (3)

If you're still awake - thanks for reading. It makes me feel like the effort was worth it. Let me know what you think - please.
As a teenager I had bad skin. As a male it was taboo to cover it up with any sort of make-up. It took me years to find a skincare regimen that cleared my skin. When I did it was an incredible relief. My confidence went up, my dating life got better. I was surprised by what a profound effect it had on so many facets of my life.
When something has helped your life so much you just want to tell everybody. I’m tempted to tell acne-ridden teens in public about how I got rid of their confidence-shattering ailment, but of course that’s out of bounds. Fortunately, as someone who works in Social Media, it’s basically my job to talk to strangers.
Though I couldn’t expound to acne-ridden teens about how that “one weird trick” changed my life, what I can do is tell you how you can cover the imperfections of your social content.
Your marketing is only as strong as your product or service. A good product/service, like good skin, will make your marketing so much easier. It’ll basically do the marketing for you through word of mouth referrals. But let’s face it, not every product or service is “great” at generating organic growth. Some businesses just take more marketing work – fact.
This is why you need to tie your marketing as tightly as possible to the value and lifestyles that your product/service makes possible – sage advice even if your product is capable of blowing up on Kickstarter.
For example, Playboy has fantastic social content. They don’t just talk about their own (*ahem) product, they also talk about things that their audience loves.
Since their audience is obviously male oriented, they share content about motorcycles, manly drinks, supercars, etc.
Doing this means you’re consistently sharing content that your audience will find interesting. And it puts a focus on branding, which 39% of top marketers say is their number one goal with social media (Ad Age).
There’s only so much you can talk about yourself. Sharing others’ content allows you to “cover-up” any imperfections you may have while also tying you into a lifestyle that’s familiar to your fans.
Great articles to share, like high-quality make-up, are only useful if you know how to properly apply them. First thing’s first, sharing just the title of an article and its accompanying link is futile, as that’s what most people who are sharing that article do. You’re just adding to the noise.
Social media is supposed to be social, not robotic. Add a human voice to your content by commenting on the article, mentioning others who may find it interesting, and adding relevant hashtags.
You’ll see an immense uptake in engagement with this simple advice. Let’s take a look at this extremely popular article from a few weeks ago and how people shared it on Twitter.
Not very original is it? In contrast, the tweet below has an emotional comment and a hashtag. What stands out about this comment is that it gives the article an angle. Getting better:

President Trump is again ramping up his rhetoric on an issue he said he hopes can energize his Republican base heading into the midterms, with an all-caps threat to shut down the southern U.S. border if Mexico doesn’t stop the “onslaught” of a caravan of migrants fleeing Honduras.
The president tweeted Thursday morning that Democratic Party leaders “are doing little to stop this large flow of people INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS.”
Trump also suggested that the migrants hoping to enter the U.S. are linked to crime and drugs that he said are “pouring in,” and he called on Mexico to stop the “onslaught.”
The president’s tweets come after more than 2,000 Honduran migrants hoping to come to the U.S. resumed their travel northward Wednesday even hours after Trump warned “anybody entering the United States illegally will be arrested and detained” in a tweet.
On Wednesday, the president also threatened to cut U.S. aid to the Northern Triangle countries — Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — saying “all payments made to them will STOP (END)!.
Mexico in a statement Wednesday said that anyone who entered its country illegally would be processed and returned to their country of origin.
While Trump is threatening to eliminate aid, Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have been pushing efforts to improve U.S. ties in Central America to reduce the flow of migrants.
“We are committed and have been continuing to put in the resources to fund programs that we hope will address the root causes of migration and help people thrive at home,” a senior State Department official told ABC News Wednesday.
Thursday’s comments were not the first time Trump has threatened to close down the southern border entirely. He made similar remarks at a tax event in May, saying if he was unable to secure funding for the wall he would “have to think about closing up the country.”

This is so hackneyed it's surprising to see in print, yet again. I suppose there's a limited quiver available to the religious apologist.
Sequences of words of the form "Why are we here?" are not questions, they are fallacies. They beg the question, in this case "Is there any reason why we are here?", or perhaps more succinctly, "Does life have a purpose?" If so, you can ask what it might be, but you can't ask that otherwise.
If this question is meant to be profound, to mean more than "Do you, personally, have a purpose?" then it presupposes the existence of the divine, because there's no other perspective from which such purpose could operate. The last quote above could be rephrased:
While science looks at the world and reality, religions consider questions that presuppose the existence of a God.
This type of argument is inanity slipped between the covers of profundity; a sheep in wolf's clothing.
Even then, there's an unbridgeable gap between supposing "the existence of a God" and subscribing to the implausible folklore of desert's edge vagabonds.

Chiropractic is a health care profession that focuses on disorders of the musculoskeletal system and the nervous system, and the effects of these disorders on general health. Chiropractic care is used most often to treat neuromusculoskeletal complaints, including but not limited to back pain, neck pain, pain in the joints of the arms or legs, and headaches.
Doctors of Chiropractic – often referred to as chiropractors or chiropractic physicians — practice a drug-free, hands—on approach to health care that includes patient examination, diagnosis and treatment. Chiropractors have broad diagnostic skills and are also trained to recommend therapeutic and rehabilitative exercises, as well as to provide nutritional, dietary and lifestyle counseling.
The most common therapeutic procedures performed by doctors of chiropractic is known as “spinal manipulation”, also called “chiropractic adjustment”. The purpose of manipulation is to restore joint mobility by manually applying a controlled force into joints that have become hypomobile — or restricted in their movement – as a result of a tissue injury. Tissue can be caused by a single traumatic event, such as improper lifting of a heavy object, or through repetitive stresses, such as sitting in an awkward position with poor spinal posture for an extended period of time. In either case, injured tissues undergo physical and chemical changes that can cause inﬂammation, pain, and diminished function for the sufferer. Manipulation, or adjustment of the affected joint and tissues, restores mobility, thereby alleviating pain and muscle tightness, and allowing tissues to heal.
Chiropractic adjustments rarely causes discomfort. However, patients may sometimes experience mild soreness or aching following treatment (as with some forms of exercise) that usually resolves within 12 to 48 hours.
In many cases, such as lower pack pain, chiropractic care may be the primary method of treatment. When other medical conditions exist, chiropractic care may complement or support medical treatment by relieving the musculoskeletal aspects associated with the condition.
Doctors of chiropractic may assess patients through clinical examination, laboratory testing, diagnostic imaging and other diagnostic interventions to determine when chiropractic treatment is appropriate. Chiropractors will readily refer patients to the appropriate health care provider when chiropractic care is not suitable for the patient’s condition, or the condition warrants co-management in conjunction with other members of the health care team.

All you foodies out there, here’s your chance to sample a cusine that you won’t commonly find in Singapore – North-East Indian Cuisine. For those of you who might not know, Indian food varies greatly as you move accross regions and states. While North-East India still remains among the lesser explored regions of India, its cuisine is renowned for its strong flavours and colourful dishes.
You now have a chance to experience the famed North-Eastern Cuisine as Yantra by Hemant Oberoi brings to you A Treat of the Seven Sisters, which is a North-East Indian Food Festival, being hosted by Yantra from 23rd to 26th November, 2017.
Anyone who loves North-Indian food, would be familiar with Yantra by Hemant Oberoi. The chic fine dining Indian restaurant in Tanglin Mall serves some of the finest Northern Indian Cuisine in Singapore. With its fine balance of contemporary and classic Indian food, Yantra presents an array of tastes and flavours in its signature dishes.
Join in as Yantra hosts a A Treat of the Seven Sisters for four nights, for dinner only from 6:30 PM to 10:30 PM, 23rd – 26th November. Promising a gastronomic delight, there are vegetarian dishes on the festival menu too, for the vegetarians out there! To stay apprised of the festival details, you can check out Yantra’s Facebook page here.
The North-Eastern region of India is a place referred to as the Seven Sisters. This encompasses one of the densest populations of tribalism and brings with it their culinary arts. This is the first time Yantra is hosting a festival such as this, taking a keen interest in making the experience as authentic as possible. Hemant Oberoi and a specialty chef from India will helm the festival.
The specially desgined menu for the festival is pork and beef-free, with vegetarian options available. Vegetarians can expect to sample dishes such as Singju which is a typical Manipur salad-type dish with Yongchak (also known as bitter bean or twisted cluster bean), lotus stem, chick peas and fenugreek leaves. Other veg dishes on offer include Petu ekung (Mustard leaves with bamboo shoot and burnt green chilli), Ahengu ngo Nappa khulo (Pumpkin curry cooked with wild lemon basil) and Yeghe kiba (Rosella flower cooked with fresh yam). Finish on a sweet note with a classic North-east Indian dessert, Chak-hao dessert or Black Rice Pudding.
In the interest of making the festival as authentic as possible, Yantra has really paid attention to details – ingredients such as the Naga Viper Pepper and Rosella flowers are being especially flown in for the occasion. While the Rosella flower is known for its health benefits (it is said to prevent cancer, and helps people with hypertension, heart disease and osteoporosis etc); the Naga Viper Pepper is known as one of the spiciest chillis in the world. So chilli lovers, get ready to challenge your spice levels! In fact, diners will receive a Naga Viper Pepper as souvenir.
As one of the restaurants on the Best Restaurants lists of Wine and Dine Singapore, Singapore Tatler, The Miele Guide and having received the notable Epicurean Star Award for the Best Restaurant Concept (Asian) in 2011, we definitely hope this should be a meal you’ll appreciate.
So dine at Yantra by Hemant Oberoi next week and go on a culinary journey accross the North-Eastern India.
Overall a very solid piece. Great b-roll shots although I did notice one shot of the lemons in which the camera got bumped. Try not to use shots like that. Other than that though, you got some great shots. I'm stoked you got an interview with a customer. You really needed that and I'm glad you went the extra distance to get that at the last minute like that. Interviews were shot well. However Lydia's interview is off to the side too much. She's looking off camera more than she should. Evan's VO was just ok. I'm not convinced that he's fully into the story. He needs to develop that on camera voice and that comes with practice, practice, and more practice. It also sounds like there's a slight echo to it. That VO needs to be super clean because he's narrating the story throughout. I like you ending with the comment about the employees being treated like family. However you show me shots of a rating they received instead. Let's see the employees and the boss interacting or smiling as they work instead. 3 points.

TIP! Those thinking about undergoing any type of cosmetic surgery procedure should take the time necessary to gather information regarding the recovery process and get an estimate of how long the recuperation period may last. When you know how long you need for recuperation, you are better able to schedule your life and responsibilities around your surgery.
You may want plastic surgery for many reasons. This includes improving your appearance, to boost self confidence or address a legitimate medical issue. Obtaining a full understanding of all that is involved cannot be discounted however, and this article was written with the purpose of helping you to do just that.
TIP! During the consultation with a prospective surgeon, do not forget to ask about his or her credentials. Inquire about the school he attended, when he finished and the amount of similar surgeries he has performed.
Take a look at images of the past clients of any surgeon you’re interviewing. You can tell if you will be pleased with the surgeon’s work by viewing these pictures. Ask anything that is on your mind, and look to prior patients for their feedback. Taking all these steps will assist you in determining which surgeon to choose.
TIP! If you want cosmetic surgery to fix the damages of an accident, you need to talk about reconstructive surgery. Many people think plastic surgery is for those who are vain or self-obsessed, so you can avoid these people’s judgmental attitudes if you call your surgery by a different name.
Inquire about antibiotics from your surgeon. It is likely that you will need to use antibiotics prior to the surgery so that your immune system is in good working order to fight infections that can occur. Talk to your doctor about antibiotics if he doesn’t mention them to you. If he thinks they are unnecessary, it’s important that you find another doctor to get another opinion from.
TIP! Talk to the surgeon you are considering using and ask about past work. Find out information like how many of these surgeries they have performed and look at pictures of previous patients.
Anyone who is preparing for an upcoming piece of cosmetic surgery work will find it wise to gather plenty of information ahead of time. Learning how much time is necessary for rest and recovery following the procedure is a key fact to learn. Understanding exactly what you are going through is the best way to feel assured about the process.
TIP! Always investigate alternate financing options. Doctor’s know that cosmetic procedures are not generally covered by insurance and most will work with you to set up a payment plan to cover the cost of your surgery.
Cosmetic procedures can be quite costly, and may also require you to miss work. Because of this, it’s recommended you have some savings set aside for any expenses. You will better be able to focus on recovering instead of worrying about what might happen later.
TIP! Before you decide on a surgeon or clinic, be sure to check out their licenses and credentials. You need to make sure you are comfortable with the hospital you’re having your procedure in, as well as with the doctor who will be performing your surgery.
Look into whether or not your doctor carries malpractice insurance. This can have a huge impact on you if your procedure develops complications; a proper insurance policy will protect you from unfair out-of-pocket expenses. If a doctor is not insured, do not use them. They may not carry insurance because of previous problems.
TIP! If you can be added to an on call list, you may be able to save a substantial amount of money on your plastic surgery procedure. An on-call list mean if someone cancels a procedure you will be called to take their spot.
When it comes to plastic surgery, there are a few options that can help with cost. Many foreign countries have surgeons that are reputable and charge less than those in the United States. Before deciding on a location, explore all of your options.
TIP! Have grounded expectations about your possible cosmetic procedure. These surgeries are limited, even though sometimes it seems they can perform miracles.
Before having surgery take time to visit the surgery center. If you happen to be having outpatient surgery in your regular clinic where you usually see your doctor, then ask to visit the surgery area before your scheduled surgery. If you become familiar with your hospital prior to plastic surgery, you’ll feel more comfortable.
TIP! Ask your cosmetic surgeon if there are any discounts available. Many clinics have a great deal of flexibility when it comes to pricing.
Plastic surgery is a viable option for many individuals, and if it is one you are considering, you are not alone. Whether you want to improve the way you look or even address certain medical concerns, understanding things about plastic surgery is important to help you decide on what you want to do.
TIP! Find out if you need to do anything to prepare yourself for the operation. Ask if you need to get rid of facial hair or the hair on your head. Plastic surgery should be […]
TIP! Remember that cosmetic surgery can be very expensive, and there are also drawbacks, such as missed work and painful recovery. These are reasons you need to have a little bit of money saved so […]

Use two conditioners when you wash your hair. Use one in the shower after rinsing the shampoo out of your hair. https://www.pinterest.ca/vivaa1291 is a leave-in conditioner. It should be applied after you are out of the shower and you towel dry your hair. The combination of conditioners will reduce the static in your hair, as well as, leaving it healthy, soft and manageable.
If you are going to condition your hair make sure you do it directly after shampooing it. This will make sure you get the most out of your conditioning and it will be softer and more managable than if you just shampooed it. You will have a more beautiful head of hair.
Figure out what type of hair you have. The amount of times you wash your hair each week depends on the type of hair you have. If your hair is oily, you may need to shampoo and condition it every single day. On the other hand, if your hair is dry, it is recommended that you wash it every other day, at most.
Alcohol can be very drying to your hair, so avoid products with alcohol in them. When applying any hairdressing products, don't put them onto your scalp because they can cause irritation of your skin or blockage of the pores. Whether your scalp is too dry to oily, the end result will always be hair that isn't its best.
Do not put hair up into tight ponytails when it is wet. This can cause you to have split ends where your ponytail is located. Your best bet is to either dry hair completely before hand, or slick it back and use a headband. This simple tip will keep your hair stronger than ever.
When shampooing, pay close attention so you can avoid removing all the beneficial natural oils on your scalp. Although you might have oily hair, if your shampoo is strong and washes out all of the oil in your hair, this can create a rebound effect in your hair's oil production. Instead, use the most gentle shampoo you can get away with. To be on the safe side, you can forgo the use of shampoo altogether and just use conditioner.
If you use a flatiron on your hair, try a silicone flatiron instead of one made with metal or ceramic. Silicone flatirons are relatively new to the market, and they have the benefit of straightening hair with just one pass through. These flatirons can cut the time you take in half!
If you really have to blow dry your hair use a leave in conditioner while you do it. This helps keep your hair from getting dried up. Although, it isn't quite as effective as skipping the blow drier altogether.
Brushing your hair allows you to spread the oils along the length of your hair. You should start at the top of your hair and brush it in long stroke that the oil are evenly spread out. click to read will look healthier and shiny if you do this every day.
Today there is a lot of debate over how frequently you should use shampoo. Although skipping a day or two will not hurt your hair, neither will applying shampoo daily. Any residue that shampoo might leave in your hair is going to wash away when you rinse it. If you feel that a daily shampooing is necessary to keep your hair clean, feel free to do it.
A cheap, efficient deep moisturizer can be found right in your pantry. Olive oil makes a fantastic deep conditioner, and can be left in your hair overnight. Simply cover your saturated hair with a cap or a plastic bag and sleep tight. In the morning, wash as you usually would and enjoy your fresh hair!
Add a cold burst of water to your hair cleaning routine. Once your hair is clean, turn the faucet to cold and rinse your clean hair with the cold water. This will help to seal the cuticle of the hair and add a sleek finish to your lovely locks.
Make sure that you get enough sleep during the course of the week for the sake of your hair and scalp. Sleep is vital as it allows your body to recharge and flush out the toxins that you accumulate as the day wears on. Aim for at least eight hours of sleep for strong hair.
Your hair should love what you plan to do to it. Go ahead and apply the information you learned today about proper hairdressing as soon as possible. The sooner you establish good hair care habits the sooner your hair is going to look beautiful for the whole world to see.
China accused Washington of hypocrisy on Friday for its criticism of Beijing's restrictions on the Internet and dissent, blaming the United States for the financial crisis and saying its own rights record was terrible.
China's Information Office of the State Council published a report titled "The Human Rights Record of the United States in 2009" here Friday. Following is the full text.
China's prime minister has rejected foreign calls for allowing the yuan to appreciate and blamed the US for strained ties between Washington and Beijing.

Cool temperatures help the sprouts develop a complex flavor with more sweet notes and less bitterness. We’ve had a hard freeze a few weeks ago — the one that put an end to the gardening season. That was probably enough to start improving the flavor.
Brussels sprouts can tolerate fairly cold temperatures. Many years, I’ve been able to leave the plants out in the garden at least until Thanksgiving and during strong El Nino years, until Christmas.
The cool damp growing season this year was not good for tomatoes and peppers but was perfect for brussels sprouts. Ours are nearly four feet high.
Since a strong El Nino has developed,we most likely will have one of those seasons where brussels sprouts can be left out in the garden well after Thanksgiving. This is important if you want to get the absolute best tasting brussels sprouts possible.
Brussels sprouts start losing their flavor just three days after picking. On the other hand, the flavor keeps improving as long as the sprouts stay on the plant. So you can see the advantage of leaving the sprouts on the plants until you are ready to cook them.
There are millions of people who will never eat brussels sprouts because they were forced to eat them when they were a child. They wonder why they were ever invented in the first place.
At one time, brussels sprouts were always picked by hand and those old commercial varieties tasted halfway decent. Then in the 1970′s and 80′s machines were engineered to harvest the sprouts. That meant physical changes had to be made to the brussels sprout plant itself in order to accommodate machine harvesting. In the rush to breed machine harvest-able plants, the cost came down drastically but the flavor was lost in the process. They became strong-flavored and bitter.
Things have changed in the past 20 years or so. Big improvements have been made by plant breeders to improve the taste of brussels sprouts, they’ve gained back the flavor that was lost during the early years of mechanization. It may be time to re-try brussels sprouts if you haven’t tasted them since you became an adult and now make your own food decisions.
Pick brussels sprouts by snapping them off the plant with a twist. Remove the outer layer of leaves. Some gardeners dig up the whole plant and save the sprouts on the stalk to pick off later.
The best way to cook brussels sprouts is to steam them until they are tender enough to be pierced by a fork, about 7-14 minutes. Some people cut a small “x” in the bottom of each stem to help them cook more evenly. Overcooked sprouts turn mushy and loose flavor and nutrients.
I plan to leave my plants in the garden as long as possible this season. And when very cold weather finally arrives, I’ll pick the remaining sprouts, blanch them and store them in the freezer.
It wasn’t your imagination, there really were more Monarch butterflies this fall and it wasn’t just because we were looking for them anymore than usual. The folks at Monarch Watch have evidence that the monarch migration is shaping up to be somewhat larger this year than last.
As more gardeners and homeowners become aware of the importance of milkweeds and start encouraging the plants instead of eradicating them, the monarch butterfly population should rise in proportion.
One statistic I saw was that there are 113 million gardeners in the USA. Now just think for a minute if each gardener added only one or two milkweed plants in their yards how many more places there would be for monarchs to grow and develop.
In a few growing seasons, a single milkweed plant can quickly turn into a sizable local population. Like so many other “weeds” milkweeds produce a lot of seeds. In my yard I counted about 80 seeds in just one milkweed pod. That small plant had seven or eight pods growing on it. That’s around 500 seeds per milkweed plant. In more fertile locations, a milkweed plant can produce 20 pods that contain over 400 seeds in each pod!
Collecting and planting seeds is the best option for propagating milkweed. Just keep in mind that milkweed seeds require a cold treatment – called stratification — before they will germinate. In the wild this occurs naturally each winter as temperatures drop below freezing. The easiest way to provide the cold treatment is to plant them directly into the soil in the fall and let nature provide the stratification.
Milkweed plants are perennials, meaning once they establish themselves, they will continue to come up year after year. Mature plants have roots that grow horizontally underground. They will send up a new shoot at intervals that grow into a new milkweed plant. So you can see how quickly milkweeds can get out of hand if you’re not careful.
I’ve had milkweeds pop up in my garden from roots sent out by plants many feet away. They can be very persistent since a piece of root as small as an inch long can grow into a new plant.
Milkweed pods are just starting to open in southern Michigan. If you want to collect seeds, now’s the time to do it. Otherwise, soon the seeds will be gone with the wind.
As an extra bonus, you can spray paint your empty pods with gold paint and use them in craft projects just like we used to do in elementary school.

2006.08.02 - The news from the ILEWG 8 Conference in Beijing, July 27th, was encouraging. In a declaration issued this day and signed by all the attendees, a Lunar Decade is declared. Indeed, "within the next two years, four independent space craft (SELENE, Changé 1, Chandrayaan 1 and NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) will orbit the Moon " These four missions will kickoff what promises to be an unprecedented period of robotic lunar exploration.
The Conferees are to be congratulated for their realization that these happy concurrencies provide an unprecedented opportunity for international cooperation and coordination on several fronts. Internationally coordinated analyses to facilitate the validation of data sets produced by different instruments, enhancing the usefulness of information acquired by multiple spacecraft
Concentrating on a small number of specific targets would facilitate the cross-calibration of different instruments. If all the orbiters monitor solar flux data, cross correlation of this data will improve calibration of all the instruments dependent on knowledge of solar fluxes. This is an opportunity to coordinate development and utilization of a common, improved Lunar Coordinates Reference Frame.
Common standards for S-band spacecraft communication, with potential for common tracking operations and backup support to other missions, if necessary. A coordinated campaign to provide data cross-check and validation for modern-era missions that have overlap in coverage, with data and experience from Past missions
The conferees seem to have realized that the final impact of orbiters on the Moon's surface is not the end of the mission but the final mission experiment. "Information about the five impact events and subsequent impacts of probes should be coordinated with other ... missions."
Standardized telecommunications, navigation, and VLBI [Very Long Baseline Interferometer] support for future orbiter, lander and rover missions. We are given "the opportunity to embark some payload technologies for navigation and guidance on orbiters and landers as part of a Global Lunar Navigation & Positioning System."
Future orbiters could be placed on frozen stable orbits where they can participate in a joint infrastructure for data relay, aid to navigation and lunar Internet, in addition to landed surface beacons.
The series of landers planned by agencies in the period 2010-2015 (the second half of the Lunar Decade - "the subsequent phase of Lunar Global Robotic Village") will provide an unique opportunity to set up "a geophysical network on the Moon" for which the conferees "recommend the creation of an international scientific working group for definition of a common standard for future Moon network instruments"
We see this declaration, and the recommendations for international coordination of efforts in a joint assault on the many remaining mysteries of the Moon, as something momentous. We seriously doubt that such a methodical and well thought out collaboration between the spacefaring nations involved would have risen by itself. If any ILEWG conference justified the existence of ILEWG, this one certainly did. We urge NASA, the Chinese Space Agency, the Indian Space Research Association, and Japan's space agency to take all of these recommendations to heart, establish closer ties between all the respective Moon mission teams, and make every effort to coordinate their efforts on the scientific levels addressed by ILEWG.
While we remain focused on the establishment of a permanent human presence on the Moon involved in the development of lunar resources, not just to provide their own needs but to help tackle our home planet's stubborn interwoven energy and environmental problems,
we see this declaration and the Lunar Decade as a positive sign that much of the desired "robotic footwork" will be accomplished in a timely fashion, maximizing the productivity of these already budgeted missions. Beyond these missions, will be "ground-truth" probes to the lunar polar cold traps suspected of harboring water ice and establishment of astronomical facilities on the Moon
To the extent that this level of international space mission collaboration and coordination is achieved, it will create a powerful precedent that bodes well for the future of mankind as a solar system wide species.
The individual missions involved are each within the capabilities of the respective national space agencies. But looming ahead are manned exploration and outpost establishment efforts that will truly require this kind of dedicated mutual collaboration and teamwork. It is not the USA that will create a "permanent" outpost on the Moon or launch a manned expedition to Mars. It will have to be an international effort, and that is as it should be, leaving turf battles behind us on our divided planet.

The SDK is the link between any compiler and the Windows OS. 3. Up to now, all variables are in COMMON blocks, and accessed by C++ using extern "C" struct.

Dr. French has a fellowship with the International Congress of Oral Implantologists. He is certified to place implants in house saving you time and money. We use implants from companies such as BioHorizon, and Zimmer to help capture the complete smile you deserve.
Implants are used to replace a missing tooth for both functional and cosmetic reasons. They are a safe alternative to crowns, bridges, partial dentures, or dentures that look and feel like natural teeth.
Implants focus on the replacement of a tooth. The basse is placed in the bone and fuses acting similarly to the structure of a nature tooth’s root. Alternatives to an implant would be a bridge or a partial. With a bridge you have to grind down the two adjacent teeth and cover both with a crown to hold the prosthetic tooth between them. A partial or a denture requires you wearing a retainer that has to be taken in and out every night and cleaned. Implants are a permanent structure that never have to be removed and can even be flossed like natural teeth.
Absolutely! When you are missing all of your teeth, top or bottom, we are able to use implants to replace these teeth. However instead of placing up to 16 implants, we would place up to 5 and have the dentureattach to the implants. This denture can by fixed or removeable, but even when removable, the denture has a solid structure to grab hold of instead of you having to fight with your dentures falling out or messing with sticky adhesive.

Those of you with Ad Blockers, could you turn 'em off while you read? Pretty please? I'll be your friend!
I’m not a light sleeper, but something woke me in the middle of the night. It wasn’t something particular—like a sound or smell—but rather, a presence.
I rubbed any remnant of slumber from my eyes and shifted my attention past the digital clock, to a large, weird shape standing at the centre of my bedroom.
I was fucking alarmed alright. A high-pitched scream was hitched at my throat and I made some squeaky sound that went against any code of masculinity I practised.
“It is okay boy, I am not here to do you harm,” the figure said again. It was cloaked in a thick robe and had an earnest voice; perhaps female—if it was human.
I struggled to speak. I was blinking rapidly, breathing rapidly, opening and closing my mouth like a fish.
“You know,” I whispered at last, after 10 seconds of self-assessment, “you don’t just stand in the middle of someone’s room in the dark, in a cloak.” I did another self-assessment, concluded that I wasn’t psychotic.
The cloaked figure clasped its palms together. Its head bobbed this way and that in silent contemplation.
Is this what usually happens? Some creepy person appears in your bedroom at three in the morning and you give it the pleasure of taking a seat? Does it slaughter you afterwards? I had no idea what was happening, but for some reason, I found myself nodding. Not politely, but rather hysterically.
“Yes. Yes! Please sit—take a seat dude,” I rambled. I pulled my cotton pillow from underneath me and chucked it at the cloaked figure. “Make yourself comfortable.”
It rested the fluffy thing on the ground, patted it thrice and then in a huff, planted its butt down with a large exhale.
I was going to throw up. I reached over to my bedside table and swiftly flipped the switch of my lamp, illuminating my room in warm, orange light.
Sitting in the centre of my room in a sparkling cobalt robe and curls of silver hair framing her face was indeed my—
“Fairy Godmother?” I stuttered. Everything seemed out of place. The walls of my room were embellished by NBA posters, my desk a discombobulated shamble of games and consoles and then… my floor accompanied by a shimmering old fairy. “Why… why do I have a Fairy Godmother?”
“Well this was quite the shabby introduction,” my Fairy Godmother stated, shifting on my pillow. “I shall further inform you tomorrow night. Same time?”
The fairy reached into the depths of her cloak—I retracted in fear—but she only pulled out a stick, a wand.
With a puff of blue mist and golden twinkling dust, my Fairy Godmother vanished into thin air with everything that was with her, leaving behind the scent of lavender. Apart from the swirls of majestic fog, my room was left the same as it was before the clock hit three in the morning.
With calm and steady breaths, I slowly laid my head back down onto the mattress, swearing violently in my head.

Public Relations is a executive level combination of art, science and instinct. It is a lot more than just making people happy. You and your public relations staff must be able to identify key issues of public concern. Public relations has a marketing job to do — and yet at the same time it serves as the corporate conscience. One definition of public relations supports both of these goals: "Public relations is doing good and getting credit for it." At the heart of any public relations program is the concept of ENLIGHTENED SELF INTEREST or SELFISH ALTRUISM
Public relations can cost less than other marketing activities. A year-long comprehensive public relations program costs less than one national network 30-second commercial.
Public relations is a third party endorsement. Articles printed represent someone other than you noting your good works. This influences and persuades opinion leaders.
Results of public relations efforts help generate new sales leads. Prospects are more receptive to sales calls about something they know of.
Public relations can establish your executives as experts. You can be a speaker for your industry and benefit from it.
PUBLIC RELATIONS DOES NOT REACH LOTS OF PEOPLE QUICKLY Unlike an ad campaign, public relations takes more time to get word out.
PUBLIC RELATIONS IS NO GOOD FOR OVERWHELMING PEOPLE The public does not talk about public relations campaigns like ad campaigns.
PUBLIC RELATIONS CANNOT MAKE AN EXTREMELY SPECIFIC POINT All your words are shaded by news media writers' perspectives.
PUBLIC RELATIONS IS NO GOOD FOR THE ORGANIZATION WHICH WANTS FREQUENT COVERAGE. You have no assurance at all of what will be covered and when.
THERE ARE NO ABSOLUTES IN PUBLIC RELATIONS You never have a guarantee that what you do will be covered by the news media to your satisfaction.
"Nothing crystallizes into anything important until one person says something to another person by word of mouth."
Image — is the collective perceptions help by the public. Image is response to the substance of identity.
We are dealing with an accumulation of impressions over time. Impressions are intangible—but vital to organization's future. A tarnished image can be restored with positive action.
The greater the identity, the greater the public expectation. There is a greater danger of a gap between identity and performance. Management must make a long term commitment to public relations. The boss has to understand and believe.
Visualize people out there hungry for your information. Assume a positive coverage of your interview. You may be misquoted. You may be grilled with hostile questions. You may be quoted out of context. The story may be slanted or reporting rumor or innuendo. Even so, the greatest danger is for you to overreact to negative coverage. Do not attack the media. Do what you must to quickly put the matter to rest. Recognize that businesses need to stop relying on the news media as their only means of delivering their messages. Find ways to take your information directly to the public. This is why public speaking skills and the ability to create interesting, appealing and important messages is so vital for executives.
We must keep coming up with dramatic focal points. Editors and anchor men and women appear to have answers, but they are really asking us a question: "What is this event or development going to mean to us?"
Sometimes scary, often rewarding. Fun and exhilarating when you are prepared. Be a player—not a spectator. Good or bad—take the initiative in all cases. Fear of controversy or criticism is a luxury no organization can afford. It is the reporter's job to dig behind the scenes. The public has a right to balanced information about your operations.
Advertising and public relations are like bacon and eggs—they go great together on the same plate but they are not the same thing. Advertising asks for the order. Public relations activities build needed credibility and an understanding of what you offer the picture-taking public. As you can see, these two functions are both vital to building your future business, yet they are not interchangeable.
One of our favorite definitions of public relations is: doing good and getting credit for it. This means that from a public relations standpoint, you have the responsibility of both doing worthwhile things in the public's interest and seeing that the public learns of these helpful acts. These are two distinct activities calling for separate skills.
Your main communication method with the media is the news release or feature release. A release is a specialized means of reporting stories to the news media. As we outline below, there is a specific format and style for this information.
The raw materials for these stories can be contributed by your staff in the form of printed articles, manuscripts or letters.
Editors will be looking at both form and content of any release they receive. They will see the form of the news release first.
Many stories are written in what is called the inverted pyramid news style. This simply means the most important information is presented first with information of lesser value following. The most vital facts for the reader, therefore, should appear first in such news stories. This is done for two reasons:
1. To allow readers to stop anywhere in the story having gained the most important information in the initial paragraphs.
A brief announcement of an upcoming event or some new business development. We recommend that these stories by hand-carried by one of your trusted representatives to the news media whenever possible.
A longer, more detailed and colorful article about your industry. Careful telephone and in-person coordination both before and after delivery of these major stories is important.
A feature which is provided exclusively to one publication in the city where you are doing business. A local exclusive differs from a local feature only in that it is offered only to a single publication.
A short announcement of an event to a special interest publication. These articles should be prepared by a public relations professional from material provided by you.
A longer article, prepared with specific comments and applied to the trade or profession to which the publication is directed. Telephone contact with the media is vital to create interest.
An announcement or article for the sponsoring organization's newsletter, or for a publication produced by a group which in some way supports the program in which your representative is participating.
Attribution is used -- either quotes or "...according to Jones, who has been in the photography industry for six years..."
First of all, a decision needs to be made with each project: Will a story be sent to all appropriate media or will an exclusive story be offered to the best news media in one or two non competing fields? To make this decision, consider the attraction an exclusive has for business editors—a story that is theirs alone. You will gain many advantages yourself with exclusives. If you successfully place the story with a major metropolitan daily, you have a greater circulation, in some cases, than all the community weeklies combined. Remember, you want publicity, but the newspaper or magazine wants NEWS—or a feature that provides worthwhile travel information to its readers. Thus you need to think in terms of news making rather than publicity. (We will be discussing what news is later.) If your goal is to be press coverage for an upcoming event, your first priority is to get a story in advance of the event. That, of course, is because the coverage might help bring in additional customers. If the media would rather report only on what occurred, then consider the value of that sort of coverage in building awareness for your future activities. In either case, the resulting article is a valuable tool in building credibility for future business—so consider reproducing and distributing all favorable articles. Use those reprinted articles in all your related mailings. They build your credibility and prestige.
A story is enhanced if it shows progress, has suspense, contains oddity, conflict and humor. In addition, it should contain human emotions. Human interest is always welcome: children, animals, the family, life-saving actions, all have great appeal. Photography is at its best capturing all of these.
Localizing: The secret to success in dealing with community newspapers is customizing the stories to their interest. What interests local newspapers most are newsworthy activities taking place in the paper's distribution area.
Premature Exposure: Remember that the media want action, not ideas. If you are about to launch a new concept in photography, recognize that the news media will want to see examples of how it works. Make it work first -- then go after press coverage.
Invite the Media: Send the news media invitations and tickets to your events. If your budget can handle it invite them along to certain events as your guest or at a greatly reduced rate. Recognize that quality news media people are sensitive to being bought. Your invitation does not entitle you to cheery coverage if something goes sour.
Stay Positive: Don't be surprised or upset if your story is changed or is not used. Even the best stories are often re-written by good newspapers. Never complain if your story does not appear as you wanted it. Learn from the experience--and smile.
Say Thanks: When a story is particularly well done--write a letter to the reporter's boss. That's even better than a letter to the writer. It is a good idea to send a letter even if the story was just adequate. Don't thank reporters for the story--that's their job. Thank them for their ability to cover a complex, sensitive, difficult topic, etc.
Know Deadlines: News people can get really cranky when they are on deadline. Make sure you know when deadlines are before calling.
One Release Per Publication: Never send a story to two different editors at the same paper. For example, it might seem logical to send a copy of your release to both the travel editor and the society writer. If you do, mark both copies clearly: "Action copy to the real estate editor -- this for your information only," for example.
Remember that reporters and editors are busy and are nearly always pressed for time. Appeal to their need to save time. Give them what they need in the form they need it.
Most newspapers receive 10 times the amount of material they can use. You are competing with all this. Fortunately for you, most of it is junk, such as:
Stories which are not localized to a community publication. A photo safari of Tarzania is of little interest to your local newspaper unless local people are significantly involved.
When photographing groups, bear in mind some members of your organization may not want their pictures used for publicity. Announce your intentions clearly beforehand. Just as in preparing for radio and television appearances, you should hand-pick a group to represent your organization, get a good mix of people. Set up your photographic setting carefully. Find a spot in your meeting place that looks modern, comfortable and neat.
Photographs with clarity and quality are valuable resources for public relations and advertising. Digital photos are now indistinguishable from film. If you are a small business or a non-profit organization, your first problem in photography might be to find a photographer you can afford. You can pay from as little as $25 an hour to $1000 or more a day for photographers. Look for young people starting out. You may, on rare occasions, be able to find a volunteer in the organization who will do the job for expenses.
Your goal as a photographer or supervisor of a photographer is to have a photo that tells a story and enhances other information or materials being used. Let's talk about some specifics in this area: The photo should tell a story. Only rarely can you walk into a situation and shoot it as it is and have it tell a story well.
Avoid presentation shows at all costs: Trite, same thing basically from Congressional Medal of Honor to the Azalea award at the La Jolla Garden Club. If you have to shoot it, consider over- the- shoulder-shots, on the scene. Explain "Looking in is so-and-so" type photos of presentations. Consider as a substitute: Person on the job, or doing what got him or her the award.
Remember in working with a photographer: Tell him or her what to shoot, but not how to shoot it. If you are not seeing your carefully considered idea being used, tactfully suggest it. i.e. "Please take a shot for me like this" after the photographer has set up his own work. A good photograph improves the chances of a well-written news release being used.
When being a photographer, or working with one, take charge politely when it is time to take photos. The people being photographed expect the photographer to know what he or she is doing. Don't get shy or passive -- get the job done.
You cannot become a photographer today or even in a few days. But with time and practice you can become a skillful photographer. But here are a few reminders if you are looking through a lens or supervising an inexperienced photographer:
Get a model release from people in photo. Particularly important if people are in sensitive positions (hospital patients, etc.) or if photos are to be used for something other than immediate news stories.
Your goal in photography is to sell a story. If you can tell a story in the photo without the help of a cutline -- you're doing it right. You will, of course need to supply cutlines -- you may call them captions -- with each digital photo.
First, of all, don't. They are grossly overdone. If you are involved in one, make sure the news being presented is truly timely and cannot be presented to the news media fairly any other way. Most of these events are ego exercises for management. Be careful not to get caught in one that is poorly planned.
If there is any way to provide the news media with all the information you have in a timely way that supports all media equally, do not put on this event. If not, follow these guidelines.
Pick a convenient time: Mornings, Tuesdays through Thursdays, are considered best. Never have an event for the media on Friday afternoon.
Check to make sure there is no conflict with other major events that the journalists need to cover at the same time.
Provide coffee and refreshments, but do not do anything overly lavish or expensive. No hard liquor should ever be served.
Most people over do press kits. We do not plan to get carried away in the amount of material you send the news media. Consider these contents:
One important avenue of publicity involves scheduling a representative for interviews on radio and television talk shows and interview programs. Every city has a number of these programs. Some are widely listened to, others are aired at obscure early morning hours on weekends.
In preparation for these talk show bookings, we recommend that you gather background information on your work and outline the most interesting and entertaining features. With this information in hand, you can begin calling the media representatives.
You should call interview program producers in their order of importance to your company. Generally speaking, you will want to call the stations with the biggest audiences first, working your way down to worthwhile but perhaps less prominent programs. If you need practice being on the air, start with the smaller stations first. No point in goofing in front of a huge group.
Follow up your calls with a media kit which provides more detail on your program. Included should be:
Some of the producers will book guests with only a phone call by way of introduction. In those cases, this packet of material serves to prepare the producer and on-air personality (sometimes they are the same person) for the interview with the guest. In other cases, the media representatives will want a closer look at his work. Follow up on the media kit mailing about a week after it is mailed.
1. BE HONEST. Reporters can tell--they make their living talking to people. It's OK to say "I don't know." Find out--and call back.
2. CALL THEM BACK. Not after lunch, not after a coffee break--do it immediately. The media works on deadlines. Miss a deadline and you can forget some stories.
As part of your files and resources, we recommend that you build a special collection of materials which will help support your public relations program. These materials can help with news media liaison, speaking engagements and other activities.
Photography publications, books and other materials which provide an overall perspective on the industry.
Reproductions of significant articles about the photography business which have appeared in publications.
Biographical data on individuals with whom contacts are desired (major new business prospects, political figures, industry leaders).
A publicity calendar for planning special events. Such a timetable should not conflict with holidays, competing or conflicting activities.
Lists of possible public relations interrelationships with other photography businesses, organizations or community events.
This reminds you where to find props, charts, maps, and other audio-visual aids which might be used by your speakers.
As your public relations program is being carried out, several aspects of the campaign should be reviewed from time to time. This is a ten-point framework for planning. We see it as a format for discussion at the next public relations meeting.
1. WHAT ARE YOUR OBJECTIVES: Your priorities must relate as closely as possible to the attitudes that surround the business community you serve.
3. WHAT ARE YOUR SPECIFIC OBSTACLES? This calls for a careful consideration of governmental, social and competitive barriers to your progress.
4. WHAT ARE YOUR SPECIAL OPPORTUNITIES? What is there in today's social or economic climate that could help you grow?
5. WHAT ARE YOUR PRESENT ACTIVITIES? Look at what is now being done to see how they measure up to the conditions just mentioned.
7. IS THERE A COMPLETE OVERVIEW? It is important to be able to think of a chain of consequences in the future rather than just present activities.
8. ARE YOU TRACKING FAR ENOUGH IN ADVANCE? Future attitudes of the business public need to be accurately predicted. You should be ready to speak out on issues before criticism is launched.
PECULIARITIES? Everyone is different. Your individuality and working philosophy help attract specific kinds of people to you.
Occasionally you will have incidents that you could just sweep under a rug or hide in a closet. If the news media find out, you had better be prepared to deal with them frankly and openly. How you handle bad news can affect how your good news is received for years. Journalists have long memories about organizations they cover—and they tell other writers about their experiences. As the old saying goes, don't pick a fight with someone who buys ink by the barrel.
You don't have to announce any bad news—but if clarifying incidents or public welfare is involved, it may be important to do so.
If a journalist thinks information the public would want to know is being hidden, the story may be blown out of proportion. Frankness, openness and matter-of-factness often result in a small story or none at all.
Find the hero—if four people were trapped in a fire, zero in on the person who jumped in to save them.
The key point here is that there is an opportunity hidden in every crisis. And the best way to take advantage of that opportunity is to plan ahead and be ready to turn adversity into a positive opportunity with all of the publics you deal with. Don’t throw away your future with the news media. Journalists have long memories. How you handle the troubling situations with the media with help you with all the pleasant, positive stories in years to come. If your company is seen as overly guarded and secretive in a bad news situation, it may never see happy-talk coverage again.
What's a crisis? It has all the makings of breaking news: it is a urgent situation, it occurred suddenly and it involves important people — your corporation's management. A crisis can shape a reputation — or shake one up.
There will always be an accident or incident that gets your management's or the public's full attention. In this type of situation there is little time or energy for politics, bureaucratic fumbling , foot-dragging or finger-pointing. Negative publicity is the kind that people always remember, but this can be turned into something positive with the right preparations.
Here's the good news: You wanted the firm in the public eye, now you have it: Everyone is focused on this single issue, the crisis. The firm can now demonstrate its concern and skills to the attentive news media and public. There can be good news wrapped up in a crisis situation. If your top executives can avoid a misguided siege mentality, you can turn into a long term public awareness benefit.
Crises, emergencies and disasters can come from within or outside the organization. When and where they might occur cannot be predicted, but many situations can be anticipated. You can plan for, train for and be ready for many incidents.
The greatest hazard to the long term well being of the company in a disaster may not be the physical loss caused by the incident, but the damage to corporate credibility caused by disorganization. And being disorganized is most likely during the first 24 hours of a crisis.
Panic is contagious — so don't panic. No matter how chaotic things are within the organization during a crisis, your executives must appear as capable and caring people who are on top of the situation. Prompt, skillful communication can ease a crisis situation and help solve many problems. Each public announcement needs to balance bad news with some good news: a hero in your midst, plans for restructuring the organization, new equipment being installed, etc.
It is vital for corporations and organizations to expect disasters and be prepared for them. Being aware of which disasters are more common, understanding their potential consequences, and assessing how prepared you are in dealing with them is an essential part of your company's growth and success. Everyone involved must develop a sense of disaster judgment which tells them what problems will go away quickly and quietly, and which will put you out of business. A disaster from the following six categories could affect your operation at any given time.
NATURE: Earthquakes, floods, forest fires, hurricanes, tornadoes, and other weather-related disasters can wreak extensive damage to your company.
ENVIRONMENTAL: This category includes plant accidents, chemical spills, industrial explosions, pollution of land or bodies of water, and toxic waste concerns.
MANAGEMENT: A variety of legal and financial concerns can turn into serious incidents: shareholder suits, hostile takeover attempts, bankruptcies, etc. Sudden serious illness or injury to high level executives might also fall into this category.
PRODUCTS: Products can malfunction, be tampered with, become contaminated or require a recall. There are other liability concerns related to products.
SERVICES: Service industries have problems such as fire, railway or vehicle accidents, aircraft high jacking or power failures.
EMPLOYEES: Plant closings, strikes, walkouts, drug testing, discrimination, and protest activities lead to crisis situations that must be reckoned with in an effective and efficient manner.
CRIME: Looting, terrorism, on-site murder, vandalism, and embezzlement are just several injustices that a company must be prepared to deal with.
Refer and adhere to the devised communication plan. Damage to a company's image is most likely to occur when an individual or a small group within the company strays from the set crisis plan.
If this information is not provided, rumors and pubic alarm will fill the void. This can create emotions in the public which can quickly cause problems more harmful than the original incident. Your executives must understand that, right or wrong, silence implies guilt.
Incidents and event which occur during the daily business of companies and organizations often become newsworthy. Of these occurrences, emergencies and accidents are of particular interest, but most companies are not prepared to deal with the news media when an emergency hits them.The realities of today's business environment is that public relations and marketing professionals are loaded with the day to day demands of product publicity, employee communications, community affairs and government relations. They may not be able to handle the results of a major fire, earthquake, chemical spill, or indiscretions such as a minority employment conflict or sexual harassment charge.The media has a way of building up pressure on you and your company during a crisis, but remaining calm and taking control efficiently during these times can make all the difference. The desire to avoid the media during a crisis is a common one, but past experience has shown that one of the worst ways to deal with the media during these times is to interfere with them by refusing to give up factual information, and by preventing their access onto the scene.
Be familiar with, and have a broad knowledge of all aspects of the media. Know what you are going to be dealing with. Read through all the newspapers and magazines—be familiar with the writers. Also, understand the workings of radio and television programs.
Keep and update a media contact list. Call these contacts every now and then to keep up on the latest.
Concentrate on the media that you want to be exposed in and want access to. This means keeping in touch on a regular basis, so that in a time of crisis you can have them cover your news.
provide information, don't let them down. Give them a number where they can reach you when they need you—not only when you want to give them some news.
Make it a habit to furnish background information about your company and your industry. Keep a file of all clippings that relate to your organization, whether you planted them or not.
Be prepared with a company spokesperson. This person should have skills in public speaking and media presentations. Like you, the spokesperson should be knowledgeable in the workings of your organization and be aware of all current activities. The person should also be available to the press whenever he/she needs to be reached.

Source: scan of clipping courtesy of Mark Hross, a descendant of Joel C. Straub through Joel's son, Charles. The exact date of this obituary and the name of the newspaper are unknown, but the story appears to have been published in a Hood River, Oregon, newspaper on 12 Nov 1915, the day after the death of Joel C. Straub.
HOOD RIVER, Or., Nov. 12 — (Special.) — Another Civil War veteran, Joe C. Straub, answered the last call here last night. Mr. Straub, who was 79 years of age, passed away at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Cora Orians, with whom he had been residing since 1910.
Joe C. Straub led an eventful career. He was a native of Ohio, having been born at Waldo July 1, 1837. In 1856 he went to Kansas with a party of men from Marion County to lend assistance to the Kansas free-state men. He was with John Brown of Ossawatamie, where the abolitionist was repulsed by border ruffians. The Brown party returned to Ossawatamie after two weeks to find but two buildings standing, the remainder having been burned. Mr. Straub was one of the followers of James Lane and General Harley.
At the outbreak of the Civil War Mr. Straub enlisted in the Fourth Ohio Volunteers under his brother, Captain William S. Straub. The Fourth Ohio formed a portion of the "Gibraltar" brigade of General Shields. After Mr. Straub was mustered out he re-enlisted in the Fifth Ohio.
For 12 years before coming to Hood River, Mr. Straub was employed in a clerical capacity at the Old Soldiers' Home at Dayton, O.
In addition to his daughter, Mrs. Orians, the veteran leaves four other surviving children — Mrs. A.W. Bishop, of Hood River, Mrs. Nettie Van Osten, of Lyle, Wash.; Charles Straub and Henry Straub, of Marion, O.

The stories behind the buildings, statues and other points of interest that make Manhattan fascinating.
In the early 1880s Julia G. McNutt and her sister, Sara, had highly unusual professions, at least for women. They were doctors. Sara later remembered the comments made by Dr. Blackwell, who advised “There are a great many women and children needing good medical and surgical care.” He said that if she excelled in her work, “you will soon have so much to do that you will not have time to wonder if some one else does not approve of women physicians.”
For six years Sara worked with children and women, acutely aware that there were no special facilities for infants and toddlers in the city. In 1887 she took steps to found the Babies’ Hospital of the City of New York. “It was thought that I would be able to take the medical care with my sister, Dr. Julia G. McNutt’s help,” she later recalled.
The fledgling institution would quickly encounter resistance. In November 1887, with the backing of wealthy New Yorkers like Mrs. William H. Vanderbilt, Mrs. Ambrose C. Kingsland, Mrs. Abraham S. Hewitt and others, the four-story brownstone at the northeast corner of Lexington Avenue and 45th Street was purchased from “Mr. Gleason” for $26,000. The handsome dwelling was described by the Real Estate Record & Builders’ Guide which said “It has a bay window on each story, and is handsomely finished in hardwood trim.”
But one neighbor on the upscale block was infuriated. Thomas B. Gifford went to court, contending “that the hospital was a nuisance in the neighborhood occupied almost entirely by private families.” He pointed out that children with contagious diseases would be a threat to the block’s residents.
On June 18, 1888 Judge Beach, seemingly begrudgingly, ruled in favor of Gifford. He began saying “The hospital is not a nuisance prima facie;” but admitted “The care of children in numbers bring danger to the youthful members of families living near.” Most importantly, there was a covenant in the deed that restricted the property to residential use only.
The officers of the hospital did not wait for Judge Beach’s decision. Because “many applications have been made for the admission of children, owing to the hot weather, during which the infant mortality is abnormally high,” they rented a house at No. 161 East 36th Street.
It opened on June 16, 1888, two days before the court case ended. There were 24 beds for the tiny patients. Avoiding a second problem, the officers announced “that they do not intend to admit contagious dieaes, and ask for gifts of money and infants’ clothing.”
The McNutt sisters were unprepared for the response. Sara told The Medical Record in December 1918, “The medical work, however, grew so rapidly, and encroached so much upon our private work, that we felt obliged to withdraw from the Babies’ Hospital a year after assisting in founding it.”
The hospital moved into two adjoining houses at the northeast corner of Lexington Avenue and 55th Street -- Directory of Social and Health Agencies of New York City, 1898 (copyright expired)
By 1891 the Hospital had moved to two four-story houses at No. 657 and 659 Lexington Avenue, at 55th Street. Three years earlier Dr. Allan M. Thomas and Dr. William C. Denning had developed a three-foot by three-foot “hatching cradle"—the precursor of today’s incubator. The Babies’ Hospital owned the now-improved model when a tiny premature infant was brought in in January 1891.
The boy was born two months early on December 21, 1890. His mother died in childbirth. Had he been brought immediately to the Hospital, his chances would have been greatly improved. But a well-meaning neighbor woman tried to nurture him for four weeks. The New York Times advised “When she turned him over to the Babies’ Hospital he weighed but three pounds and was terribly emaciated. It was decided at once that there was but one way to save the little fellow’s life, and that that was to put him into an incubator.”
The prognosis was cautiously optimistic. The newspaper said on February 1, “It seems almost too much to believe, but there is a probability that the helpless, pitiable atom in the box may develop into a strong, handsome man. The nurse says that her charge may some day be President of the United States.”
The Hospital’s valiant attempts proved futile. Three days later the funeral of Baby Johnson, deemed by The Times “a mite of humanity,” was held in his father’s home on West 60th Street.
Two weeks later Nell Nelson, writing for The Evening World, described the hospital. “The ‘Babies’ Hospital of the City of New York’ is the only institution of its kind in the country, and as far as can be ascertained it is the only one in the world that is reserved for the exclusive accommodation of babies.”
Of the 214 babies that were admitted in 1890, 57 died. Often the condition of the infants was such that there was no hope of survival when they arrived. Nelson reported that on the day she arrived there were four “little Dutch cradles” in a bay window, one of which was empty. That child’s body had just been removed. She asked the nurse about the remaining three patients.
She was informed that another name for marasmus was “starvation.” Further investigation explained the plights of the urchins. In 23 cases the father was unemployed; in five he was sick or hospitalized; “in one case the father was in prison; in fifteen cases the mother was deserted by the father.” Two mothers were insane; in six cases the mothers were dead and in another six cases she was too sick to care for the child.
The stifling heat of summer worsened the chances of the babies’ survival. And so by the summer of 1894 the hospital acquired three cottages at Oceanic, New Jersey. On July 14 that year The New York Times reported “The Babies’ Hospital, at 657 Lexington Avenue, has a deserted appearance. There are reminiscences of babies everywhere in rows of little empty cribs, some of them with tiny baby caps, little gowns, and shoes lying around them, but not a baby is to be seen anywhere about the house.”
The entire population of the hospital had been removed to the cottages, “comfortable, sunny, and spacious, [where] the babies grow well and rosy under the influences of fresh air, skillful treatment, and nourishing food.”
The demand for admissions far exceeded the facilities of the old brownstone houses. In 1901 the architectural firm of York & Sawyer was given the commission to replace the property with a modern hospital building. The firm filed plans for the “7 and 8-story brick and stone” building in January 1902. The anticipated cost was $80,000—more than $2.25 million in 2016.
A lavish fund-raiser for the building was held in the home of Mrs. William Hamilton Harris at No. 306 West 75th Street on the afternoon of December 12, 1902. The wealthy socialites who attended were less interested in the fact that “tea will be served and Sherry’s Hungarians will play;” than in dolls.
Manhattan’s top dressmakers had designed gowns for the doll sale. And the dolls were displayed in elaborate settings. The New-York Tribune announced “The dolls will compete in a maypole dance, in coasting, tobogganing and other winter sports, and will exhibit their skill in housekeeping, in the drawing room, bedroom and other departments of the household.” One especially-appropriate scene was “a ward in the ‘Babies’ Hospital,’ with babies and nurses in costume, with beds and furniture in proper form.” The moneyed ladies were offered “a rare opportunity [to] purchase dolls, dressed in the most exquisite taste, for Christmas gifts.”
While demolition and construction were underway, the Babies’ Hospital moved temporarily into the Nursery and Child’s Hospital. On May 12, 1902 the New-York Tribune published York & Sawyer’s sketch of the building and gave readers an idea of what was to come.
The basement would house a “disinfecting plant,” the laundry, kitchen and “servants’ dining room.” A dispensary was located on the first floor, as were a room for the “clothing committee,” offices and a clinic. The second floor was for staff. It held the nurses’ dining room and quarters for the hospital board, the secretary and the matron.
Nurses and other staff lived on the third floor; while the upper floors contained wards and “model nurseries.” On the top floor was a solarium—a must-have at the turn of the century when sunlight was believed to cure diseases like tuberculosis—and a laboratory. The Tribune promised “The hospital will be fitted up in the most modern fashion.”
Following the hospital’s completion, the Real Estate Record & Guide pointed to it as an example of the renewed interest in brick as the major component in building design. On February 14, 1903 the journal insisted “A distinct revival in favor of brick is observable” and pointed not only to the Babies’ Hospital, but to the new American Express building on Madison Avenue, and Public School No. 43 on Amsterdam Avenue, among others.
The original structure was just two bays wide on Lexington Avenue. A woman, coincidentally, pushes her baby carriage at the corner. Architectural Record 1903 (copyright expired)
Indeed, the building, completed in December 1902, strayed from the expected limestone or marble cladding of its Beaux Arts style. The porticoed entrance, on 55th Street, was located in the two-story rusticated stone base. A lush frieze of draping garlands undulated over blank medallions below four stories of variegated brick that created a textured façade. French-inspired cast iron balconies relieved the flat surface at the fourth floor. Above the copper cornice, supported on scrolled stone brackets, the solarium and laboratory were nearly hidden from street view.
A few weeks after the hospital moved in, it hosted the annual reception of the Board of Managers on January 16, 1903. “The hospital will be open for inspection,” said the New-York Tribune, adding it “is fully equipped with the most approved appliances…The entire building is admirably arranged for its uses, and those who will visit it for the first time next Friday have a pleasure in store.”
At the reception meeting it was announced that Mr. and Mrs. John Sherman Hoyt had promised $500 a year to extend the hospital’s work. The money would be used to provide home visitations, highly important because the condition of the infants often digressed when returned to their tenement homes.
“It has always distressed us to send the patients back into their often miserable homes, there to continue their downward career,” explained Dr. L. Emmett Holt.
Within only six years the facility was too small for its ever-growing work. In September 1909 York & Sawyer filed plans for a $10,000, eight-story annex to house the dispensary and nurses’ dormitory. The resulting addition was seamless; discernible only by the closest scrutiny.
The pitiable circumstances of the parents who entrusted their children to the Babies’ Hospital was evidenced when a woman collapsed in the doorway of the East 51st Street police station on January 29, 1910. Mrs. Gertrude Lough was just 20 years old. Her husband, Thomas, was an unemployed carpenter who had not been able to find work for several months.
Unable to pay their rent, the couple and their five-month old baby boy, Harry, had been evicted from their apartment three weeks earlier. The landlord took pity and allowed them to live in a vacant building on East 50th Street, as “caretakers.” They had a place to live, but no food.
When Gertrude Lough was revived, she told police “they had had nothing to eat since Thursday, when they had a few crumbs of bread.” The week before Thomas found an odd job and earned $5. That was spent on milk for the baby and doctor bills and medicine for him.
A doctor diagnosed the woman with “starvation and fatigue.” Dr. Arnold went to the Loughs’ rooms where he found Thomas holding the malnourished baby. Harry was removed at once to the Babies’ Hospital.
In the meantime, back at the station house the police began passing a hat. Four prisoners, who overheard Gertrude’s story, asked to contribute as well. The men raised $15. And Dr. Arnold offered to try to find work for Thomas Lough.
Perhaps the most publicized patient of the Babies’ Hospital was little Mary Margaret Roberts. She was born deformed on November 23, 1915 with an open spine, and was paralyzed from the waist down. Her mother, in serious condition following the birth, was not informed of her baby’s condition for fear of the shock the news would bring.
Mary Margaret was brought to the hospital immediately after birth. When her father, Joseph E. Roberts, and grandmother, Mrs. Margaret Branley, realized the condition of the girl, they insisted that she be allowed to die, “rather than live hopelessly deformed.”
“But they have been overruled by Dr. Maurice Rosenberg,” reported The Evening World the following day. “Officials of the hospital, in a statement issued to-day, also let it be known that every effort would be made to prolong the life of Baby Roberts.”
But when Chicago surgeon, Dr. Harry J. Halseiden, was asked to travel to New York to perform the operation, he refused. The New York Times said he felt “that science should not be employed to prolong the life of a monstrosity.”
With no surgeons with Halseiden’s expertise available, the doctors of the Babies’ Hospital were forced to capitulate. On November 25 it was announced that the infant “will be permitted to die a natural death, even though an operation might prolong her life.”
The case received national press attention. Dr. Harry Halseiden was, at times, depicted as a heartless cad. In all instances, the doctors at Babies’ Hospital were shown to be disheartened at their forced decision. Finally, on December 3, 1915, the New-York Tribune ran the headline “Baby’s Problem Solved by Death.”
During "Baby Week" in March 1916 the Babies’ Hospital published daily tips for mothers in the newspapers. On March 9 the tip was “Babies get terrible whacks, some mothers forget them—stuff a ‘pacifier’ into their mouths—the worst thing ever made for a baby—and then they wonder why remonstrance follows later on.”
In 1929 the Babies’ Hospital was absorbed by Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and left Lexington Avenue. The building at Lexington and 55th Street was converted to offices and retail spaces were carved into the street level. At some point the lovely cast iron balconies were removed; but otherwise the structure, with its tapestry of brick, survives relatively unchanged.

After Saturday's enjoyable return to the football season, I was looking forward to my first Tuesday game in 7 weeks. Originally I was planning on going to Saffron Walden v Chelmsford City on this date, especially as there would be a few people I knew in attendance. The Champions League game between TNS and B36 Torshavn was also under consideration but in the end I opted for something more local in Milton Keynes based New Bradwell St Peter who were playing Wellingborough Town in a Friendly. The main reason for this is that fellow hopper Anwar was still fasting for Ramadan, and if it's a mid to long range trip we both like to have a nice sit down meal.
Unlike the football league side in Milton Keynes, NEW BRADWELL ST PETER do have a bit of history. They were founded in the 1880's and played under various names before adopting their current monicker just after the end of World War 2. After starting out in the North Bucks League, they joined the South Midlands League in 1970 and have been there ever since, even staying when it joined forces with the Spartan League in the mid 90's. Though they only won promotion back to Division 1 at the end of last season they have had plenty of success in the competition. They even won it's Senior Division in the 1997/98 season. Up to the Premier Division they went, and finished a best ever 10th in 2001, this when it was a step 4 league. Though they have won a number of local cups, most recently the Berks & Bucks Senior Trophy in 2000, they have little history in the FA Competitions. Their only game was in the Vase in 1996. They went out at the first hurdle, losing to Stansted in the 1st Qualifying Round.
On the day of the game it was my day off as usual and for once I had a decent nights sleep, waking up at 7.30. I had a quick look on the internet and had a bath before giving my Dad a lift to the garage and then down town, buying a few things and filling my car up with diesel. I then spent the rest of the day before leaving chilling at home and doing research into my future football adventures. Normally I'd have gone for a jog or a walk but it was raining on and off all day and I couldn't get out.
It was of course the 10th anniversary of the 7/7 bombings in which scumbag terrorists murdered 52 innocent people in London. I remember clearly where I was at the time as you do with all big news events. I woke up with a stinking hangover and that is rare for me as I normally don't get them. It was as a result of a heavy nights drinking, with amongst others, the then Wycombe physio Shay Connolly. I needed food and some liquid refreshment and so I made my way to the Irish Bar near where I was staying. Swigging down a few pints of orange juice while I waited for my brekkie my attention was turned to the TV where Sky News was on. Horrific scenes were going round on a loop with blown up buses and trains along with badly injured people and death tolls. Later that evening happier scenes emerged with Wycombe winning the San An Cup against Oldham Athletic.The only other game I had been to on 7th July was in 2012, and a first ever game at Evesham United's new ground as the hosted Manchester United Legends in front of a 4 figure crowd.
I was twiddling my thumbs in the latter part of the afternoon, so I was glad when it came to the time to leave. I had myself a Prawn and Chorizo Jambalaya before leaving at 6.10. After meeting Anwar at 6.35 we had an easy journey through Milton Keynes, arriving at 7.15. There were a few groundhoppers in attendance, including my Facebook fan Jim who lives in Rushden so I chatted to him and checked Facebook while I waited for the game to start.
It was a good open game with number 9 'Jake' opening the scoring within 10 minutes of the game starting as he rounded the keeper and slotted the ball into an empty net to give the visitors the lead. They deserved to be ahead with the lions share of the play but New Bradwell had a couple of chances on the break. Number 7 doubled the lead with a close range finish on 35 minutes.
It was still 2-0 at half time and during the break I went to use the toilet in the clubhouse and saw a lovely boxer dog. Wellingborough continued their dominance and made it 3-0 with a fine goal after 52 minutes. The hosts pulled one back after 55 minutes, following up a parried shot from close range. They had a chance to reduce the arrears further but the penalty awarded for a foul just inside the area, was saved by the keeper. They paid for it as Wellingborough further extended their lead on 65 minutes with an arrowed shot into the bottom left hand corner. A 5th was added with 5 minutes to go as the visitors eased to victory.
After the game, we got away pretty quickly. After stopping for Anwar to get a takeaway and dropping him off home, it was 10.35 when I got home myself. I watched TV for a bit before going to sleep just before midnight.
THE RECREATION GROUND is quite a basic affair with just the one area of cover comprising of just under 60 seats. The rest of the ground is open hard standing in a pleasant setting with a windmill as a backdrop. All the facilities appear to be in the clubhouse although I did not buy anything with it being a fairly low key game. There were a number of pubs and shops within walking distance too.

Modified drivers simply means that the author takes official or beta drivers from the manufacturer and starts to tweak them for either better image quality and or performance. Please bare in mind that the driver manufacturer, in this case NVIDIA, does not support drivers like these.
Make sure you see the readme file before installing these. The new drivers are ready and they are based on the previous official set by Nvidia. There where not many changes since last set except for added cards support and some updated software, but, Why change something that was already good? :P
Provided that you already have the main materials to have a climbing wall inside your backyard, which is the wall itself, it is better to contact a professional if you are not a pro in this sector, as a badly designed wall will often not last long exposed to weather and other condition. Choosing a special pressure treated wood for exterior may be a good idea. The screws should also be a consideration.
It will be not so fun playing in a dull climbing wall, even it will be hard attracting people to play there at the very first time. Then, you just need to come up with ideas to make your climbing wall looks good. For example, you can paint your climbing wall, and the climbing holds with variation of colors.
Patio shade ideas are interesting for them who want to have a patio with the roof on it. Well, even though patio is a fresh place that located out of our home and sometimes some people like to have it without any roof, it does not mean that a patio cannot have any roof. You can make the roof by yourself. Today, we are going to talk about the roof or the shade that covers our patio, so if you are interested, you can pay attention to this article.
There are so many patio cover or shade ideas that we can use for our inspiration. Sometimes, the cover styles or designs only have some differences. We can say that the differences are sometimes about the material that we choose for the shade and sometimes the designs that we choose. No matter what is the material that we choose and what is the design, we have to make sure that we get the function of the shade.
What is it function? The function is of course to protect us from the rain or sometimes it can protect us from the sun light. It is depending on what the type of the shade that we choose for our patio. That is all about the patio shade for you.

Mostly it is difficult to prove when a member is involved in an accident. Several cases have to go through the court especially when parties refuse to take responsibility. It is true to say in most cases, insurance cases end up paying where there are not supposed to pay. Imagine a driver who fell asleep/drunk/negligent and cause an accident but blames the other part. The above are the answers. The truck bus MDVR is even unique as owner/manager have control of the device and not the driver and in addition, has deterrence effect on would be criminals etc.
It is a fact that criminals have found a way to bypass the tracking system. We have also found a way to stay ahead of the criminal element. The device is small (10 to 15 cm) and can be hidden anywhere in the vehicle and/or Cargo. The batteries unlike our mobile phone ones, are long lasting. Imagine having a second device in addition to the wire device which is easily cut by criminals. Its features are very unique (alerts functions) which is not the case with the tracking companies. Mostly we are shocked at realizing the car/goods is gone etc. and some chose not to report or just do it as an insurance requirement. How interesting when one tells the law enforcement, the location of the stolen item?
This new hi-tech standalone vehicle tracker will give you a peace of mind. Small (117*59*3 mm) and can be hidden anywhere out of reach of the criminal. Powerful magnet and long lasting battery (5000, 10 000, 15 000 and 20 000 mAh) which lasts from a year till years before re-charging.

Farmers have suffered huge financial losses due livestock theft. many insurance companies have been reluctant to insure livestock because there was no known device to protect animals against theft. My article on this was in the Farmers Weekly (19th February 2016 issue, page 59). There is a lot of research being done to ensure an improve version (4G LTE/5G or higher with a camera). Features associated with the device can make us proud as livestock thieves will seek a less hazardous way. This new hi-tech security gadget is the answer to a livestock theft and will ensure rustlers seek a hazardous way.
There is still a gap on home alarm system as some cannot afford the monthly subscription of security response system. On the attach, the info short is that the device is a community alarm system in that anybody in the neighborhood with such an alarm will pick up an intrusion from their neighbor's property (wireless no charges). it is a very good product for community forums (exclusive to Find Me Security Technology).

When talking to clients, I continually hear concern that traditional qualitative research methods may not be helping them understand what really drives human behaviors. And it’s a legitimate concern.
Many qualitative (and for that matter, quantitative) methods involve asking questions and waiting for answers (“look at this, and tell me what you think”). And what we get are rational, considered responses, but that is only a portion of what really drives human behavior. It is therefore critical to use qualitative approaches that can tap into System 1 thinking in order to better understand the subconscious influencers and drivers of human behavior.
Utilize projective techniques. Personification exercises, brand obituaries, picture sorts, collages, word associations, deprivation exercises, and a whole host of other projective techniques are designed to get below surface responses to uncover subconscious attitudes, feelings, and behaviors. When thoughtfully incorporated into a group session or interview, they can break down barriers, foster communication, and mine emotional depths that simply wouldn’t surface with a basic Q&A approach.
Incorporate an observational component. This allows you to observe discrepancies in behavior between what someone says they do and what they actually do. Many behaviors, particularly those that are repeated day after day, are automatic and sometimes totally subconscious. By discussing what we have observed after the fact, more nuanced answers are elicited.
Capture “in-the-moment” behaviors using mobile technology. For example, we’ve used mobile intercepts with panel members whose location services are on and who enter a geo-fenced location. This allows us to capture respondents’ reactions to an experience as it takes place and before they’ve had a chance to consider their response.
It is our responsibility as qualitative researchers to continually seek ways to get below surface responses, uncover a more complete story, and gain insights that are grounded in consumers’ actual behaviors rather than their reported ones.
GivingLarge is an inspired initiative set on highlighting the significant efforts of Corporate Australia to give to our community.
The inaugural GivingLarge Report found a staggering $867 million was donated to the community by just 39 ASX50 companies in the 2017 financial year
By showcasing corporate generosity & encouraging healthy philanthropic competition, GivingLarge helps to drive increased community contributions and valued social change.
Want to know which companies give the most? Choose an industry below to review each companies key givings statistics
The GivingLarge research analysed publicly available reports of the ASX50, compiling their community investment statistics to develop a unique data set, aimed at drawing attention to corporate Australia’s efforts in this area
To take account of the impact of a company’s size, levels of community investment across companies are compared as a percentage of their profit or earnings (before specific items). For the ASX50 this means grouping companies by how they declare their profits or earnings before tax. For these reasons, analysis of companies in the same sector & with the same measure will be the most meaningful.
The companies included in this report should be acknowledged, congratulated and encouraged to continue their giving and reporting. The GivingLarge report helps shine a light on good practice and inspiring others to follow suit.
Strive is a new organisation dedicated to highlighting the remarkable philanthropic efforts of corporate Australia. By showcasing corporate generosity through focused research & public awareness efforts Strive aims to help drive valued social change & increased community contributions.

New and unexpected turns happen in the world of fashion! Saying unexpected we do mean that in the proper sense of the word! We were just shocked after looking through the spanking new Jean Paul Gaultier Couture fall/winter 2014-2015 collection, but the reason for our amazement were not only the gothic inspired pieces and hairstyles having created an overall quite dark, and well, scary looks, but also the culmination of the show, marked with the appearance of Eurovision Song Contest winner Conchita Wurst on the runway presenting the bridal piece of the designer! This was, in fact, more than just unpredictable!
Thus, the show started with the all-black leather with furry details, adorned with extravagant headwear accessories and sassy with classy leather gloves. The amazingly chic and voluminous collars running through the outerwear garments topping classic white shirts should also be noted here. The same can be said about the other combinations decorated with the houndstooth pepita patterns and designed as pairs of jackets, miniskirts and pants. The interpretations including red and black looks should also be included in the list of the best looks, especially when coming spiced up with the gothic pale makeup and extravagant hairstyles.
The mishmashes of classic and sporty looks styled into uber imaginative and not-for-everyone combos featuring sporty pants tucked into stiletto heels were the next scandalous pair in this line. Other perfect all-black looks include combos with white kerchiefs around the face and some more explicit variants made with a white shirt and finished off with chic white pearls. Stripes, furry apparel options and full silhouettes were all in for the coming looks, too.
Transparency plays created with gray tones and at times also accompanied with scrupulous lace textures can’t be missed out of the list, either. The same can be said about the glittery black alternatives and the black with golden looks, spiced up with freely hanging fringes. The following silver looks reached such a level of sophistication that they even had the absolutely same silver shade for the hair, too. In addition, the other ways of putting the transparency plays also came with huge chain prints all over the full silhouettes of floor length princess type gowns, which made up an image of a fairy tale witch!
Finally, there went Conchita with the black with red dress, adorned with a red belt on the waist and red details running along the waistline in the forms of fringes. Thus, if you love scandalous and super surprising fashion events, the Jean Paul Gaultier Couture fall/winter 2014-2015 fashion show has a lot to tell you!

Laser lights that penetrate into the second layer of the skin, such as the Vbeam laser and the hair removal laser, the GentleYAG, have an added benefit that they stimulate natural collagen production and restructuring in the skin. This causes skin to smooth and become better supported. A series of treatments for just this purpose is done to achieve the collagen re-stranding and improvement in skin texture using our Vbeam laser. We often suggest that a series of treatments (typically 3-5) is combined with a peel series, especially on the face, neck or chest. An estimate is always performed prior to treatment to determine what would be require to achieve the best results.

The cost cover maintenance, creating the job database and partnerships with 2k, Rockstar etc, keeping our tools, software and content up-2-date, e-books worth over 49 USD, guides, video tutorials, life-time support and much more. We have tried to lower cost to a minimum.
As our Platform/Build Engineer you'll be responsible for creating tools and systems to advance our in-development builds towards a polished, technical release across multiple platforms. You'll collaborate with a small team of developers to optimize efficiency of day-to-day tasks via tools and automation, while improving build performance and supporting QA.
Hi Chris, being a game tester sounds fun, but it’s a hard job and doesn’t pay as well as the other jobs in the game industry. If you’re 13 and want to work in games, then I’d recommend working toward being a game designer, programmer, or artist. Depending on which one attracts you the most. Check out my article on the different jobs in the game industry, and see whether one of those sounds interesting, then work in that direction.
I really like video games but I have a short attention span because I have ADHD or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder it doesn’t bother me when I am playing games only when I am doing other things like writing or reading I am an excellent reader but not a great writer I really want to be a video game tester I already try to find bugs and glitches in the games I play it helps to lengthen the game I have medicine that I take for it but it makes me a bit A-social I don’t get aggressive or any thing like that but I can be kinda shy would that be a problem.
Project managers ensure that a game is completed on time, within budget, and using the right resources. Prior to production they analyse game design specification and work out milestones, schedules, equipment and teams. They control financial resources and negotiate all contracts with suppliers and contractors. They may also oversee ongoing maintenance issues after launch. This is an increasingly important role as production schedules lengthen and development costs increase. Project managers are employed by development studios and publisher’s in-house development teams.
A video game company doesn't function like your typical workplace. Rather than working regular office hours throughout the year, the company goes into "crunch mode" as a game's release date approaches. Because release dates are inflexible – the company has to get the game out by Christmas, the television ad time has been purchased months in advance, and so on – if there's more work that needs to be done, everyone just has to work harder. Any video game tester can tell you that crunch time means long, long days, running on an intoxicating blend of caffeine, junk food and sleep deprivation.
The Quest for Your Career series can help. Each week, we’ll focus on one of nearly 30 jobs in the video game industry across several job families including art, design, programming, testing, production, and more. Each interview features an experienced industry veteran who tells all about what the job is, what it takes, and how you can start preparing right now.
Hi Satadala, I think you have enough experience to get a job as a game tester. So it’s hard to know why you have not been hired yet, you may just need to be persistent and keep applying. You should also try applying for smaller game studios, as EA/Ubisoft/Etc. likely receive hundreds of applications each week. You may have better luck with a smaller studio to start out.
Hi Arun, most QA jobs are full-time jobs. But you could possibly learn programming and get a degree in the evening and weekends from schools that offer continuing education or adult-learning certificates. For example I learned programming and made my first game demo while I was a tester, and then I completed a 1-year game development certificate course while I was working full time as a game designer.
i practically live and breathe video games. I can talk about them for hours. (ask my boyfriend.) when people tell me that they never got into video games it almost breaks my heart a little bit. but, I am going to college, and since I’d like to have my career based around video games whether it would be designing them, programming, or testing them, what kind of classes should I take? 3D animation? graphic design? does it all depend? I would love to make this into a career so I would like to be able to have some degrees and proper knowledge to make my resume more impressive, and eventually climb the ladder.
Hi Tyffani, you seem very passionate about games, that’s awesome! There are lots of different careers, so you need to figure out which one(s) might “click” with your interests and talents. You could start by finding out whether you are more attracted to art, or to programming, or design. Check out the Quest for Your Career articles to learn more about each one – once you find something that sounds interesting, then you can start thinking about how to pursue it. Have fun!

Compounding the physical and mental stresses that QA testers endure was the complete lack of job security. "During training, they told us it's not a matter of 'if' you'll be laid-off but 'when'," says Keith. "They flat-out tell you that what makes a good employee is the number of bugs you find and it is this number that will determine if you are kept on or not." This methodology, however, did not accurately take into account the quality of dedication that went into a project. "Here I was recreating and logging how to get stuck in the tail of a helicopter. I would have other testers comment on how much they liked my bugs, because I was one of those guys who would be able to reproduce those bugs that stumped everyone else, but when it came to the end of the project, the guy next to me had more bugs, so I was laid-off and he was not."
Cold Iron is seeking an experienced Console Gameplay Engineer to join our world class team on our next AAA title for consoles and PC! Are you a passionate game developer? Is making an awesome game the thing that gets you out of bed in the morning? We’re sure you’re amazing in your field, but do you see perfecting your skills as the means to making the best experiences possible? Great, we want to hear from you!
Every model or character in a game will need to be textured. One of the skills of a texture artist is to put detail into each 3D model’s textures, with the smallest amount of data. Simple “flat” textures make 3D objects look fake. Adding imperfections to perfect textures is one of the tricks a texture artist can use to make 3D environments and objects look real.
This can vary widely depending on the specific team/project you are working on. I've placed some testers into roles where they literally are pushing buttons for an entire day waiting for an error to occur, and other roles where a tester is sitting right beside the game developers testing a game in real time as game code is being written. There are some companies that work extreme hours in order to finish projects on time but from what I've seen over the years this is not as common as it used to be. There always will be crunch time where you can expect to work some OT, but extended periods of OT for months on end are not that common anymore.
I am interested in becoming a game tester. I am 21 years old and have done some college (not towards this profession) however, I have no desire to finish. I know you don’t need a college degree but, it is preferred. I don’t have a lot of knowledge when it comes to game design, programming, etc. and don’t mind taking a couple of classes to learn more about it because gaming is my passion. Are taking classes about game design and programming ok? Is there any other specific classes I’m supposed to take? Answering these questions would be greatly appreciated. I saw above from the other comments that you reply rather quickly which gave me the courage to right this. 🙂
Hi Stephen, you aren’t convinced by my articles on game developer salary, which are well-cited? And not by my interviews with game industry veterans from giant game teams like Assassin’s Creed, Forza Motorsports, Project Spark, and mega-hits like Plants vs. Zombies? Or by all my articles on interviewing at game companies, based on many years of experience as a hiring manager? Then I’m afraid you can’t be convinced.
It might surprise you to learn that strong writing and communication skills are essential for a good video game tester. The ability to write in a clear, brief, and effective manner will help you describe the glitches you find and how you found them. Your clear writing will give developers a clear path to addressing the issue and creating a fix. You don’t have to be a poetic, colorful author; you need to be a clear, concise, and detailed communicator.
Hi my name is Brant and like anyone else here im looking for a game testing job to make big bucks. I'm 11 but before you stop reading this I want to tell you that I would make a great emplouye. A job like this is my dream and I'm not gonna sit around and wait for it to happen. I'm gonna make it happen. I just really hope that you can find the right sight for me to go on to and find a job like this.
Game testing does not typically require specialized education, so you could start applying for jobs now. Search online for game studios or testing companies that have open positions for “game tester” or “QA tester”, and apply online. There are numerous articles on this site on how to write your resume and apply for jobs, look under the “Blog” menu for more information. I wish you luck!
HI, I noticed that most of you guys, if not all of you are adults. Well I am in 8th grade. I play video games whenever I can. Some days not at all, other up to 6 hrs. My dad doesn’t support my love for games at all. My mom isn’t as bad but still she wont be pleased, because I haven’t told them that I want to be a video game tester. I would like you guys to give me some about were I should go or what I should do to accomplish this. By the way I live in California by UC Irvine collage.
The job outlook for testers is directly tied to the video game industry. As long as people are lining up to buy the latest versions of Fallout, Madden, Call of Duty, or the hottest labels, there will be a need for testers to “break” these games. While it is unknown just how many video game testers there are in the US, the number is certainly in the thousands.
Make sure to keep up-to-date on video game trends. For example, by reading industry magazines or blogs, you can find out when new games will be released and which games are preferred by certain demographics. Trade magazines and blog sites may also offer insider information about game developer companies, which may prove to be useful knowledge when you try to find open video game tester positions.
Grammar check and spell check your resume. That's a personal pet peeve of mine and many hiring managers I work with. Someone that applies for a testing role but can't catch spelling or grammatical errors in their own resume is usually passed over. Writing bug reports is a large part of a game tester's job, and developers and test managers don't have the time to guess what you meant.
At the top of the list of dream jobs for gamers is video game designer. Those who work in this occupation come up with the concepts that eventually become video games. They see those ideas through to fruition by developing storylines and characters, and then guiding them through production. They collaborate with other members of the development team including artists, programmers, and audio engineers. Job titles include game designer, lead designer, and level designer.
Hey Jason, I really hope you reply to this because I can use the advice. I’ve been playing games since I was about 8 and ever since I love pointing out glitches and bugs. Because of this I would love to become a game/QA tester. Unfortunately I’ve been looking for advice online to find colleges for a while now, and I’m running around in circles. If you email me I would be able to get into more detail and information about my situation. I greatly appreciate any advice you give me, thank you.
Hello Jason W. Bay I was playing video games with my dad when I was around 6 months (I wasn’t very good at all) Like running to wall for hours and for days too. And you can see dad laughing. And soon I was getting good at it. So when I was 10 years old I was thinking for when I was 4. I want to be a Game Tester and my dad said to me “You can be anything you what you got to believe it inside yourself” So I believe for a every long time, Now I’m 17 years old and thinking for almost 13 or 12 years now.
Hi Jason, I seem to find myself in a predicament. Currently I am moving on to my senior year at Penn State and I need a new major. I was pursuing Computer Engineering, but programming and I do not get along very well (Once you go past “if” statements I’m Lost). So my first question is, what majors are good for entering the game industry, that don’t involve programming. My next question is about finding an entry-level position that I can learn on the job. I used your job search tool that you provided and most jobs seemed to require previous experience, any suggestions there?
my name is jose barbosa. I searched long and hard where to go to apply for a game tester. I want to get paid for something i love to do.I love to play video games alot. I went to the search bar and it kept sending me to sites that states to pay to become a member so they can get me out that the companies that are looking for game testers but it just seemed alil iffy for me to provide them info about me and my finances. I just want to know where do i go to apply for it because i known a guy once who was doing it and making good money doing it too.
Attitude: Companies look for testers who have a good attitude, are hard workers, and can be fun teammates. They’ll avoid you if you’re overly negative, sarcastic, arrogant, or angry. If that sounds like you, then start practicing a positive attitude now, so it will become a habit by the time you apply for jobs. No matter how skilled you are at testing, nobody wants to have a jerk on their team.
In games you play, look for glitches and errors. When you find them, document them thoroughly – when it happens, how it affect play, and if you can, list possible fixes for the problem. Then report these issues to the company that publishes the game. Your correspondence over this issue could help give you a contact person in that studio. And this could get your foot in the door of that company.
In fact, many of the testers I’ve known over the years were working as testers so they could pay their way through college. They would work part time while they went to school, or even full time while they took classes in the evenings. (Many colleges have “evening degree” programs for working professionals.) Then, after they got their degrees, they got a new job in the game studio doing what they went to school for – like art, programming or design. And you can bet they also got a healthy pay increase to go with the promotion.

An attempt to discuss every single product available for the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role-Playing Game.
The Ifrit's Chosen is a short adventure/encounter written by Paul Wolfe and published by Mystic Bull Games.
There are an amazing array of free materials available for use with Dungeon Crawl Classics. Mystic Bull Games, and author Paul Wolfe, have created several of these. The Ifrit's Chosen in one of them, a short adventure location which may be uncovered by PCs traveling via caravan across a sandy desert.
As the name implies, there is a fantasy Arabian theme to the adventure, being a location from the now-lost Caliphate of the East Winds.
The adventure seems devised largely as a means to have a PC make a pact with the Ifrit, Afara, who can be taken as a patron. Unfortunately, no patron write-up is present...but then, how much can you expect for free?!?

Under the Inspection of Churches Measure 1955, as amended by the Care of Churches and Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Measure 1991, all consecrated buildings of the Church of England must by law be inspected once in every five years by a registered architect or chartered building surveyor (the ‘Quinquennial Inspector’ or QI) who is approved by the Diocesan Advisory Committee (DAC). Most other denominations and many secular organisations which are responsible for historic buildings now adopt a similar approach to inspections.
Surrey based chartered surveyors Chawton Hill Associates summarise ChurchCare’s guide on selecting a QI as follows:
The professional should be suitably qualified and ‘whose training, accreditation and experience in buildings conservation corresponds with the complexity and significance of the church building’
If your church is listed (Grade 1 or 2) or classified by the Church Buildings Council as a Major Church, the QI should have demonstrable experience of work with buildings of that listing grade
Any potential QI should be invited to visit the church and meet members of the PCC or fabric sub-committee before appointment
You should check the value of the QI’s professional indemnity insurance (bearing in mind that £250,000 for each claim is a good minimum)
Check the QI’s report format covers the repair of the building, maintenance, sustainability, safety of the structure, unsafe floors and access
Chawton Hill Associates will be attending this year’s CRE show at Sandown Park in Surrey - Stand S108 (just follow the signs towards Cindy’s Bar at the opposite end of the hall from the main entrance) where you will find information on their extensive ecclesiastical experience and details of their Quinquennial Inspection Report ‘CRE Show’ special offer.

While we are waiting for the vanity top to come in, I’ve been poking around the fixtures in anticipation. Here is a picture of the basin faucet parts – should look good when installed and fits with the style of the shower fixtures.
For those that are interested, the faucet is a Grohe Seabury in chrome. We looked at a ton of options for this, including some very expensive DMV (formerly Porcher) selections. This one was the best match for what we wanted – and I always like the little ceramic buttons on the cross handles.

The expression of genes potentially involved in paralytic shellfish toxin (PST) biosynthesis was quantified during cell division of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium catenella. Basic precursors of the neurotoxic PST molecule(s), such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), have been hypothesised, but no genes coding for PST production have been definitively identified in dinoflagellates. Sam encodes the enzyme SAM synthetase and two other candidate PST genes S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (Sahh) and methionine aminopeptidase (Map) have been previously identified in the closely related PST producing dinoflagellate Alexandrium fundyense. PST production and expression of Sam, Sahh and Map were examined concurrently during cell division in A. catenella. The PST profile of A. catenella was dominated by C2 (30-37 mol%), GTX5 (12-19 mol%) and GTX6 (27-33 mol%) and was constant over the cell cycle. However, the net cellular PST production rate varied over the cell cycle and was highest (127 fmol cell -1 h-1) during the G2+M phase of the cell cycle (56% cells in G2+M), slowing considerably (-14 fmol cell -1 h-1) as cells entered the G1 phase (66% cells in G1). Quantitative real time PCR revealed that Sam, Sahh and Map were up-regulated (doubling in each case) during PST production and the G2+M phase of the cell division cycle before irradiance. Alexandrium catenella actively produced PSTs during this dark period, suggesting that photon irradiance was not a direct trigger for PST production. Interactions between cell division and PST production appear complex and the present study has demonstrated correlations between PST production and expression of Sam, Sahh and Map, which warrants further investigation.

A balsamic vinaigrette dressing is not some closely guarded secret made mysterious by a celebrity or gourmet chef. A good tasting vinaigrette is easy to make, and healthy for you. Oil and vinegar salad dressings or vinaigrette recipes can be made by those of us who have not attended the culinary institute.
Times have sure changed since Seven Sea’s Italian Dressing and Wishbone’s Green Goddess sat on every store shelf as salad dressing staples. Remember when we thought “Original Ranch” was a vast improvement for our salad dressing repertoire, and store bought bacon bits were a hit? Then packaged spring mixed greens became available, and pine nuts were considered healthy and… just a moment; you still buy bottled salad dressings?
Our quest for “lighter fare” and “healthy greens” in our diet, has led us down a daunting path, searching for that elusive ‘healthy salad dressing.’ Low carbs, low cholesterol, and “healthy for all that ails you,” has become a must. So what is it, that we should, (or better yet) ‘are allowed’ to put on top of our salad that’s good for you?
Today we walk down the salad dressing aisle in a gourmet food store and behold the gourmet condiments from floor to eye level. Organic spreads, sauces, and accoutrements. Wine vinegars, infused oils, and herb flavored vinaigrettes. Some endorsed by celebrities. Some seen on TV. Some made by celebrities, (yeah, right). Some made on a distant island, in some strange sounding place. (We move on a step further.) We shake our head at Modena consortium, imported Spanish, and California Napa Balsamic vinegars. A huge question mark appears over our heads as we gaze at Aceto, Traditionale, aged, and Special Blends. We mutter, “What hath God Wrought?” Inventor, Alexander Graham Bell, couldn’t have verbalized our incredulous thoughts more accurately.
A simple oil and vinegar salad dressing, why is the degree of difficulty exponential? It needn’t be. A simple vinaigrette dressing recipe can be made easily, from simple ingredients, be healthy for you, and actually taste great.
The key ingredients in a vinaigrette dressing, is a traditionale aged balsamic vinegar, and an excellent olive oil. You don’t have to spend a fortune for the balsamic either. Two very good balsamic vinegars that are very reasonably priced, are Caroliva Reserve balsamic and Masserie di Sant’Eramo balsamic. (Those other vinegars that are under $8, …don’t bother).
Your balsamic vinaigrette dressing will go great with other dishes besides a salad, too. A balsamic vinaigrette is outstanding with fresh lobster and scallops, artichokes and asparagus. A balsamic dressing also goes well with fresh sliced tomatoes or steamed vegetables and greens.
A balsamic dressing recipe can be altered to your individual taste. The normal proportions for a balsamic vinaigrette dressing are one part balsamic vinegar to three parts olive oil, with seasoning of salt, pepper and Dijon mustard. A rule of thumb is one teaspoonful of mustard for every half cup of salad dressing. The flavor of balsamic vinegar is rich and intense, and with a delicate olive oil you may want to use proportions of one part vinegar to four or five of olive oil. Other herbs and spices will enhance a balsamic vinaigrette, such as chives and sage. Even a bit of finely grated fresh ginger root will add zest to your dressing. It is all a question of how you want your finished dressing to taste.
Use a blender to mix the ingredients. It will produce a thicker vinaigrette dressing. One serving will equal 2 to 3 tablespoons of dressing. One cup should easily be enough for 6 to 8 servings of mixed green salad. Refrigerate and store in a covered container. Whisk well before serving.

Media freedom and freedom of expression on the Internet are increasingly under threat. In June 2012 the freedom of expression rapporteurs of the UN, the OSCE, the OAS and the African Union together with Article 19 and the Centre for Law and Democracy saw the need to adopt a joint declaration on crimes against journalists; resolution on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet, particularly freedom of expression, has been adopted by consensus at the Session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Moreover, the UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity has been endorsed by the UN Chief Executives Board, the highest level coordination mechanism of the UN system.
All these initiatives show that -with the evolution of the Internet- the scope of media has expanded considerably. We no longer can focus only on the traditional media, i.e. printed press, radio and TV. Today, the notion of media brings together and merges traditional offline media and on-line means of communication over the Internet, the so-called new media tools that include; social networks etc. As new media may be extremely powerful in countries in transition towards fundamental freedoms and democracy, as the Arabic spring clearly showed us, freedom of expression is facing new challenges.
The development of new forms of media is rapid and there is a need to discuss and find solutions to a number of new issues related thereto. The safety and protection of a variety of media professionals and media actors which go beyond the definitions of classical journalists, is certainly a major concern. Against this background, the Forum will address issues relating to safety of on line media actors. This will cover questions, such as: What are the safety issues? Who needs to be protected and how?
To what extent do existing international instruments, standards and best practices apply? and are they effectively implemented? Do professional rules and ethics of traditional media apply to non-traditional online media actors? If not, how do we protect the unprotected? What is the way forward? What can be done by states, civil society, the media industry and international organizations?
The forum will also be framed by the following topics, that are both considered as essential pre-conditions to guarantee pluralism of the media in any country:
Round table two : Positive obligations of the states and supranational bodies to ensure safety of journalists
I think that most men are idiots when it comes to treating women (myself definetely included). Ahmed Ragab of AlAkhbar newspaper ridicules men who think they're smarter than women:
Men gloat because science says that their brains are bigger than women's brains. But men ignore women's deviousness that spins them lovers and husbands. Secondly, they ignore the wisdom of the scholar who said that it takes a mother 20 years to make a man out of her son, and it takes a woman 20 minutes to make a donkey out of her lover. Thirdly, they ignore the scientific fact that the man's brain is much smaller than the donkey's brain.
Well, there is good news and bad news here: most intelligence tests show that women tend to cluster more towards the middle than men (although not much.)
This means that there are some men who are smarter than almost all women, and some who are dumber than almost all women.
With regard to your post on women's brains, are both women and men not guilty of 'deviousness that spins them' lovers and husbands and wives?
Women have to be devious, but men wouldn't find us devious if they were as smart as us. That's why they can't figure out what we are up to :) We are the smarter ones :) Hee hee. Just kidding ;)

Its always tricky to think of a sufficient amount of targets to teach for various goals in an ABA program. When given a general goal, parents are always looking for specific lists to use with their children. For example, a child’s goal may require him to learn 50 different verb-noun mands. Parents often have difficulty coming up with 50 different examples.
I am going to share target lists for a variety of goals that are often targeted in a home ABA program. The purpose of this is to share ideas. You can use this list as a foundation to brainstorm even more ideas for your child. Of note, what you target should be individualized to your child. Analyze your child’s interests and what is most functional before blindly following a target list.
First up, verb-noun Mands. This goal is appropriate for children who are in Level 2 of the VB-MAPP and already have a large repertoire of single item and action mands mastered. Of note, for my teams, I require that the child can use the target verb with at least 3 different nouns.

In 2006, anti-White bias led to a witch hunt against Duke lacrosse players. The war on White men has only intensified since.
The infamous Duke lacrosse scandal is one of the most well-known and controversial attacks on the symbol that is the White alpha male. The case is interwoven in the advanced form of identity politics known as intersectionality. Intersectionality is defined as “the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, and gender as they apply to a given individual or group, regarded as creating overlapping and interdependent systems of discrimination or disadvantage,” which in layman’s terms is essentially the fetishization of diversity. The Duke lacrosse scandal is principally interesting because everything that happened did not fit the standard mainstream media narrative and for that reason it remains controversial to this day.
Lacrosse is the epitome of White identity, played almost entirely by WASP-y chads on the east coast. Due to its whiteness, this scandal drew particular attention and scorn from the mainstream media, not to mention the fact that the young men involved were the embodiment of everything the J-left hates: handsome, wealthy, athletic, and successful.
Heading into the 2006 spring lacrosse season, Duke men’s lacrosse players threw a party at the house of one of the team captains. At the party, there was excessive drinking and things got so wild that eventually strippers were hired to perform. An argument broke out between the two strippers and some of the players which abruptly ended the party. After leaving, the two strippers were later picked up by the police.
Delirious upon being picked up by the police, the women admitted they had been drinking and had taken muscle relaxants, along with several psychiatric drugs. One of the women claimed to have been raped by three of the Duke lacrosse players at the party. The team was subsequently suspended for several games, and when the Duke University administration put pressure on the coach to resign, the entire season was canceled.
In regards to intersectionality, there is a lot at play in this case. There is gender related tension since it was a rape investigation, but since the both women were Black, the prosecuting attorney alleged it was a hate crime. Another key factor was that the two women were stripping to pay their way through state college, while the lacrosse players all came from affluent families. Due to all of these dynamics, a narrative was created: spoiled rich White kids who party too much raped a poor Black woman. It’s a narrative we’ve seen all too often, casting White men as the evil oppressors of minorities.
Once the incident made headlines, backlash ranged from a never-ending lynch mob protesting outside the homes of the players, to bricks being thrown through the window of the coach’s house during dinner. To make matters worse, the only person who stood up for the accused players and the team as a whole was the head coach. He continued to be the team’s only advocate, even after he was forced to resign by the school’s (((administration))). By canceling the season, Duke University publicly threw the entire team under the bus before the investigation was even concluded to maintain good public relations.
Eventually three players were arrested and charged with rape, and the prosecution pursued additional charges of sexual assault and kidnapping. As the investigation went on, the stripper’s story began falling apart. First, she had difficulty identifying her attackers; when shown photographs of the team, she alleged that some players were at the party despite them not being present at all. When investigating one of the accused attackers, it was discovered he had an alibi with ATM and phone records to prove it. Further along in the investigation, the other stripper claimed the rape story was fake. The investigation was finally dropped when too many inconsistencies occurred in the stripper’s story and she even began to doubt her own credibility due to her own mental health and drug abuse problems. The critical turning point in the case occurred when DNA testing was carried out. Every player on the lacrosse team provided DNA samples, and when cross referenced with the rape kit, not a single one of the players’ DNA was found. However, in typical thot fashion, the rape kit did contain several dozen unidentified DNA samples. The county prosecutor lied, informing the press that the only other DNA sample found was from her boyfriend, completely covering up the multiple unknown DNA samples they found. The DNA testing lab director was even fired for giving a misleading report about the evidence. Eventually, the entire case against the accused players crumbled away, detail by detail, and the young men were cleared of all charges.
The county prosecutor, Mike Nifong, was an unscrupulous character. He was approaching a Democratic primary election to keep his job and thus played up and inflamed the tensions underlying the case in a crooked ploy to stir up support from Black voters. Over the course of the investigation, there were two separate ethics complaints filed against him. In the end, Nifong was fired and disbarred. Six Duke lacrosse players filed a federal lawsuit against Nifong, and he was ordered to pay $30 million to each player. Nifong ultimately filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. May he rot in hell.
News sources today preach about the danger of “fake news,” but it’s ironic that many of these sources published their own fake news regarding the Duke lacrosse scandal. Instead of waiting for all the facts to come in, the national media launched a witch hunt against, not just the accused players and their team, but against their perceived White privilege. In their eyes, it wasn’t three men who attacked a woman, it was White male privilege oppressing the lower classes. The news saw the alleged crime as being objectively worse just because the defendants were rich White men and the accuser was a poor Black woman. The underlying jealously toward the young men’s status only further fueled the rage of the J-left.
Additionally, the young men on the team were continually mischaracterized through the use of lacrosse stereotypes: they’re all spoiled WASPs, they use cocaine and binge drink, they have daddy’s money to get them out of trouble, etc. This national media witch hunt resulted in literal lynch mobs harassing the innocent young men for several months on end, including hordes of protesters stalking them and their families.
The Duke lacrosse scandal and more recently the University of Virginia Rolling Stone scandal demonstrate an ongoing pattern in society’s attitudes about race, class, and sex. In our efforts to undo racism and discrimination, the pendulum has swung too far in the other direction. Grievance against the privileged classes of society has turned into a sick revenge fantasy: corrupt politicians agitating race relations just to win reelection, scientists compromising the integrity of their testing, and journalists declaring the suspects guilty on the basis of Whiteness. In its essence, this is a war between the haves and the have-nots, the gifted and the mediocre, the Whites and the coloreds. This ongoing struggle only further proves how much the have-nots need the haves, if not to mooch off of and tear down, then simply to envy.

2/2/2007 - F.E. Warren AFB, Wyo. -- Investigators were on the hunt for one little girl. They had watched the child grow up, but they didn't know her name or where she lived.
However, with each new case they found more photos of this unknown girl. She was just a little older, but the event never changed -- she was being molested by an older man. These images haunted investigators who wanted nothing more than to rescue her from a life of sexual abuse.
Then a teenager looking at pornography on a computer in his high school library stumbled upon one of these photos. Recognition came immediately. His father was molesting his sister.
Fortunately, in this real case, help arrived after the brother confronted his sister with what he found. Most victims are not as lucky, and people continue to swap photos and movies of what some call the most horrendous, violent and vile images.
"True child pornography, if you see it, you would never believe it," said Lt. Col. Vance Spath, staff judge advocate for the 90th Space Wing here.
Capt. Julia Muedeking, Warren's prosecutor in such cases, added that these pictures are not pornography as most know it. "Every one of these images is a crime scene."
In 2006, Warren saw about 15 child pornography investigations. Now, the base faces about 30. Nearby Cheyenne, Wyo., is experiencing a similar increase: 35 cases in 2006, and currently about 400 ongoing investigations.
This increase could be attributed to the efforts of the nationally recognized Wyoming Internet Crimes Against Children task force. The ICAC task force created a computer program used around the world to find, track and report, in real-time, people dealing in child pornography on the Internet. With millions found in more than 200 countries, the ICAC's lead agent said the high numbers are not because his task force is aggressive but the crime is so rampant.
"This is not like shooting fish in a barrel; this is like taping a duck to the end of a shotgun and seeing if you can hit it," said Agent Flint Waters as he pointed to a desktop screen.
His computer just found someone in Wyoming with 221 suspected images of child pornography. Another screen displayed 40 records from investigators around the world who, during their investigations, have found people in Wyoming trading in child pornography.
Criminals who prey on or exploit children may wish to think twice before coming to Wyoming. But even with the ICAC's efforts, the crime continues, possibly due to a wide misconception of what child pornography truly is.
It is a federal crime to receive, possess, reproduce, distribute, sell, pander or produce child pornography. Federal law defines child pornography as any lascivious image or movie of anyone under the age of 18. This might be anything from a semi-nude sexual pose to intercourse and beyond.
In Wyoming, an 18 year old may have consensual sex with a 16 year old; however, if he takes a sexual photo of his girlfriend, he has committed two crimes: producing child pornography and possessing it.
"Airmen can get in trouble, not knowing it, just by doing what they think are the most innocent things," Colonel Spath said.
Some might, out of curiosity, search for child pornography or click on a link in a questionable e-mail, but Colonel Spath warns everyone to simply stop before doing something criminal.
"Don't go near the line. If it says, 'pre-teen,' or if it says, 'barely legal,' I would go with probably illegal to look at the website," he said. "The titles are graphic. You will know whether it is something that deals with baby care or babies being abused. And, yes, it is that graphic out there."
"By and large, the images we're working depict the horrible and brutal rape of children under the age of 8," he described. "No one would look at the stuff we're prosecuting and say, 'Oh, that's probably alright.'"
The crime doesn't stop with just still images; with high-speed Internet connections, movies are becoming more common.
"In a lot of cases, these movies might be 30 minutes long, and you can hear the child screaming for help," Agent Waters said.
U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has made child exploitation on the Internet one of the Justice Department's top three priorities. He explained why before a Senate committee last September.
"It is the faces of child victims that haunt my dreams," Mr. Gonzales said. "I can see their eyes, that awful emptiness, as if their tiny souls are trying to detach themselves from their desecrated bodies. The images of these victims have become part of my heart, and I am not going to tire in this fight to protect them."
"Moreover, these disturbing images are only the beginning of a cycle of abuse," Mr. Gonzales continued. "Once created, they become permanent records of the abuse they depict and can haunt the victims, literally forever, once they are posted on the Internet."
Agent Waters explained that in one situation of a 4 year old in Georgia, investigators found a movie of her sexual abuse in 800,000 cases within 18 months.
"You can't take that away; you can't undo that, and there's no other crime like that. It continues to come back and haunt," he said.
The National Center for Missing & Exploited Children reports that of those arrested for Internet-related child pornography 83 percent had images of 6 to 12 year olds, 39 percent had images of 3 to 5 year olds and 19 percent had images of children younger than 3. In most cases, but not all, the victims were girls.
Professionals highlight that sexual contact at young ages disrupts the complicated development of human emotions.
"Children don't have a fully developed emotional repertoire. It can be very confusing to children when things like this happen," said Maj. (Dr.) John Stetson, a psychiatrist with the Warren Life Skills clinic. "Simple things like interpersonal relationships and issues with trust can be devastated. And that has a life-long effect."
Safe Harbor, a children's justice center in Cheyenne, works with children who are victims of sexual abuse and reports that such children often show signs of nightmares, eating disorders, fears, poor school performance and poor peer relationships. However, the long-term effects remain vague.
"Children are resilient at times, and that's a good thing, but we don't know the big picture of how long they will deal with the effect of what has happened to them," said Lynn Storey-Huylar, a forensic interviewer with Safe Harbor. "Sexual violation of children destroys their innocence, and you can never get that back."
She noted that people who collect and share child pornography are perpetuating the victimization of the child in the photo.
"Somebody who's downloading that porn, for one moment, is getting a little sexual gratification, and then they go on with their life. But that child who is the victim in that picture will live with that for the rest of their life. It's a life-long sentence," Ms. Storey-Huylar said.
There's no solid profile on the type of person who gets involved with child pornography. Outside of most being white males, the rest is anyone's guess. Child pornography cases have led to the arrests of doctors, soccer coaches and even police officers.
"You would think that someone who is engaging in this kind of behavior is a weird, single, older guy who kind of lives by himself in the corner house, but there are no specific identifiable factors. It's fathers who have families; it's guys who are married; it's successful business men," explained Glenn Garcia, an outreach manager with the Warren Life Skills clinic.
"A lot of guys find out too late how destructive it can be. So many that we catch didn't mean to end up addicted to this stuff," Agent Waters said.
According to Agent Waters, about 60 percent of child pornography possessors eventually admit to molesting a child. Though not all act on it, when they share their child pornography, they could cause someone else to commit an even worse crime.
"Perhaps the person downstream from them is the one that uses it to validate their intentions and uses it to justify the rape of their 18-month-old grandchild," he said. "I suspect it may not mean as much to the person who's looking at the screen, but I bet it means a lot to that 18 month old."
Mr. Garcia added that most criminals are also very secretive to the point that spouses and other family members may never know. This emphasizes that pedophilia, a sexual attraction to children, doesn't inhibit judgment.
"[Pedophilia] is a deviate thought pattern from the norm, but it certainly doesn't prevent people from telling right from wrong and knowing that if they engage in that behavior, it is wrong," Major Stetson explained. "These people know that what they are doing is not a society norm. They know they need to keep it secret."
There is help for people with pedophilia. Treatment is not easy and tends to be lengthy, about 5 years, but it is available.
"People who have these thoughts or urges, we would be happy to work with them and try and help them before it crosses over into criminal activity," Major Stetson said.
Those who think they can still hide from investigators may be surprised to know that even home computers log everything they do, and the Internet is far from anonymous.
"If they are going to do stupid, criminal things, I'm glad they think we can't catch them because it makes it easier," Agent Waters said.
"Well, we're going to know," Agent Waters warned. "We're going to kick their door in, seize all their material and throw their butts in jail."
Military members are always under the jurisdiction of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The UCMJ's general article, Article 134, allows for the prosecution of child pornography using the federal law.
However, this doesn't mean a military member will always face a court-martial for the crime; the local U.S. attorney's office may try the case in federal court. If the military member also used a government computer for the crime, they may receive a conviction in federal court then come back to face a court-martial for violating Article 92 of the UCMJ for misusing government equipment.
"Those alleged criminals who don't face a federal court will likely face a military one," warned Col. Mike Carey, 90th Space Wing commander. "There's no tolerance for this behavior in society, and there's no room for child pornographers in the Air Force."
"The punishments you face are severe," Colonel Spath added. "It's not days in jail; it's months, years or decades in jail and probably the end of your career."
Federal law allows possessors of child pornography to receive up to 10 years in prison. Those convicted of receipt and distribution may face an additional minimum of 5 years with a maximum of 20 years for a first offense. Production of child pornography carries an additional minimum of 15 years.
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jim Anderson explained that the law doesn't stop there. The U.S. guidelines increase the sentence for such things as the age of the children photographed, the degree of violence depicted and the number of images found. And each movie is immediately considered 75 images.
He added that most people prosecuted for child pornography possession have no criminal history, but rarely do they receive anything less than 5 years and 10 months in prison. Some see 15 years for a first offense.
"We will deal with them fairly, we will deal with them appropriately, but they will be looking at significant sentences if convicted," Mr. Anderson stated.
The U.S. attorney's office in Cheyenne has made prosecuting child exploitation cases a priority. Vigorous prosecution aside, Mr. Anderson credited the ability of ICAC agents in finding people with child pornography.
"Once they find the child pornography on the computer, it's pretty easy for us to make a case," he said.
When a possessor is charged, federal law allows holding them without bond. Mr. Anderson said this is because anyone who is sexually aroused by seeing a 3-year-old child being sexually victimized is of great concern to the safety of the community.
"The nature of the images that we typically see in these cases, the normal person would be very disturbed and sickened by these images," he explained. "Sooner or later, we think there's a substantial likelihood that these folks will act out. That's why the law treats it so seriously."
Once convicted, possessors of child pornography also become registered sex offenders and have to report that for the rest of their lives. They can try to explain to everyone they meet that it was possession and not molestation, but that won't always work, especially during a prison sentence when some child pornography possessors have to be separated from the general prison population.
"I have had clients, who I've defended, who went to jail for molesting children; they're not well liked," Colonel Spath said.
Captain Muedeking added, "Even convicts have a level of what's acceptable, and they don't find this acceptable."
More so than other type of crimes, those involving the alleged exploitation of children have the potential to ruin lives and reputations.
August 22, 2010 /24-7PressRelease/ -- More so than other types of crimes, those involving the alleged exploitation of children have the potential to ruin lives and reputations. These cases are often tried in the court of public opinion far sooner than they are taken before a judge and jury. Although the burden of proof lies with the State or Government, by the time the trial starts, the Defendant often feels he actually bears the burden of proving his own innocence.
Evidence of pornography or obscenity possession or distribution is often found on Internet file-sharing or social networking sites, as well as, desktop PC's or laptops and even on portable file storage devices like flash drives or SD cards. Determining the source of this information is often difficult, particularly when an investigation begins solely based on information found online through network specialists tracing the activity back to a certain computer address or user. By the time that is done, the content could have been erased from the computer. Computer forensics experts are often brought in to recover the data and perform further analysis.
Locating evidence on a PC or other device does not automatically result in charges being brought. Even with proof in hand, law enforcement officials need to determine that the suspect was the one who actually possessed, distributed or manufactured the illicit material. The ease with which computer hackers can take control of another person's online accounts, screen names, and email addresses and infect computers adds another facet to these cases. Police and prosecutors should, but often don't take into account the possibility that a computer virus could have downloaded the material. Often a perfectly innocent visit to the wrong website or by clicking on a cleverly disguised banner ad can result in pornography being downloaded on one's computer without his/her knowledge.
If law enforcement officials do not take the time to properly investigate each incident, an innocent person's life can be turned upside down. A criminal defense attorney will do everything in his/her power to have charges dropped or secure a "not guilty" verdict at trial in these cases. Even if the evidence was properly seized, the defense can retain its own computer expert to show that the material was not intentionally or knowingly placed on the defendant's computer or that unqualified investigators tampered with the computer prior to its submission to investigators trained as forensic experts, thereby tainting the evidence.
Several cases involving the manufacturing, possession or distribution of child pornography have drawn attention in recent months as part of a nationwide crackdown on the sexual exploitation, solicitation, molestation and abuse of children. The national program, known as Project Safe Childhood, has a two-fold purpose: aggressive, publicized pursuit of offenders and identification of victims. Federal, state and local law enforcement agencies are specifically targeting crimes against children that are occurring via Internet postings and file-sharing programs; using those tools to trace the origin of illegal content and prosecute those in possession of it.
Any publicity, even via unbiased reporting given to charges filed against suspected offenders can fuel public outcry and possibly taint a jury pool far before a trial begins. As an example, in May of 2010, a Parkville, Maryland, man was charged with (among other things) sexual exploitation of a child and several child pornography offenses. The Baltimore Sun covered the story, giving sensational details about the charges themselves and the evidence relied upon to make the arrest. This article inspired hate-filled comments including some referring to him as a pervert, a few calling for castration and others hoping he is attacked by prisoners if he is convicted.
Similar remarks appear on other news sites who reported on others facing allegations of crimes against children. It is just this sort of public sentiment that results in a "guilty until proven innocent" attitude that can irrevocably damage the reputation of someone later acquitted or against whom charges were later dropped.
Due in no small part to highly publicized initiatives like Project Safe Childhood, the penalties for any child pornography-related crimes are stiff. Depending on factors like the number and type of charges, prior criminal history and the likelihood of future criminal behavior, being convicted of one of these crimes in a state court could result in a significant prison sentence and lifetime registration as a sexual offender. Penalties are even greater in federal court; for example, the minimum prison sentence for the mere possession of child pornography is five years. Anyone facing such harsh punishment needs a skilled and passionate advocate at your side that knows the inner workings of the criminal justice system. Your chances of successfully fighting the charges may dramatically increase the earlier an attorney becomes involved in your case. For example, if you seek legal counsel before an arrest or serving of warrants, when you suspect that charges may be forthcoming, an attorney can intercede on your behalf in dealing with the investigative agency involved, thereby eliminating the possibility that you will allegedly say something that is damaging to your defense.
Keep in mind also, that in dealing with federal investigators, any statement deemed to be false will be treated as the commission of a felony punishable by up to five years incarceration. Obtaining legal counsel should ensure against this possibility from becoming a reality.

The number of FinTech deals fell by 29.5% YoY in Q2 2017. Worldwide small deals have suffered the most from this fall in total deal numbers with investments valued under $1m falling progressively from 34% in Q2 2016 to 17% in Q2 2017. Despite falling total deals, the number of deals valued above $5m was up by six in Q2 2017 compared to the same period last year. The second quarter of the year saw deals valued 0-$1m, $5-$10m and $10-$25m receive an equal share of deals. In contrast Q2 2016 saw deals valued below $1m receive almost 1.5 times the combined share of deals valued between $5-$25m.
The trend seen in the quarterly graph above has been developing since 2014. In addition, figures for 2017 so far suggest that the fall in the share of deals valued under $1m dollars may be speeding up. This segment lost 4% of deal share in 2015, 7% in 2016 and looks set to lose 14% of deal share by the end of 2017, assuming the trend highlighted in the last five quarters continues.
The yearly data exposes growth in deals between $1m and $5m. As the FinTech sector proves its worth, investors are willing to commit slightly more capital in the early stages.
There has also been growth in the number of deals valued between $5m and $25m, taking 34% of deal share in H1 2017. Part of this segment is a $10m deal to financial research & analytics company Quovo, in April, from F-Prime Capital Partners and Napier Park Global Capital.
The total number of disclosed funding rounds in North America fell by just over a third in Q4 2016. Despite a small increase in the opening quarter of 2017, deal numbers have yet to recover. Interestingly, this fall in disclosed funding rounds was entirely due to a drop of 48.8% in the number of deals valued under $5m in Q4 2016 compared to the previous quarter. Since the end of 2016 the number of deals valued in this segment has fallen further, settling at 67.4% lower in Q2 2017 than in Q2 2016. In this period, the number of deals valued above $5m has risen by 10%.
In contrast to the sudden fall in deals valued under $5m in North America, deals valued between $1m-5m have remained reasonably consistent in Europe with the number of deals valued under $1m falling by an average by 19.6% each quarter as investors look for early stage opportunities in emerging markets.
The fall in the number of smaller deals during 2016 was also seen in the yearly data as mentioned previously by FinTech Global.
Unlike Europe and North America which have both seen increases in the share of large deals, over the last four quarters Asia has seen a steady reduction – dropping from a high of 27% in Q3 2017 to 21% in the first two quarters of this year.
The combined effect of a drop in the share of the largest deals and smallest deals is that over the last five quarters the share of deals valued between $1m and $25m has grown by 20%.
Q1 2017 was a particularly weak quarter for Asia in terms of deal numbers, with the number of deals closed in all segments falling.
In Q2 2017 the Average deal size in North America was more than 2.7 times the average deal size in Europe and 5 times the average deal size in Asia.
In the last five quarters the average deal size in North America has increased by $15.6m as a result of the shift to larger deals.
The average deal size in Europe rose by 21.8% in Q2 2017 compared to Q2 2016. However, it remains only 36.7% of the average deal size in North America.
With an increase in mid-size deals in Asia the average deal size has halved in the last five quarters.

These kinds of types of retailers are not usually schooled inside the items they may be selling thus they will usually let these people opt for extremely affordable prices while they simply want to get rid of all of them. Clearly at this time there are zero guarantees that items will continue to work properly and you do experience to fork out a lot of time going around to look for good specials. Second-hand or cd merchants are as well good resources. Make sure you number out whenever they normally publish their innovative supply of electronics, hence that you can come to be one of the starting visitors to observe their latest products. Every shop has their own private plan and this may change once a week so make sure you ask the store manager for all those details. A drawback is that the retail outlet executives are often educated to price items appropriately so that is a bit more harder to look for great offers that you just would normally get for a garage/lawn deal.
The most dependable and the majority trustworthy technique is to find a extensive or perhaps dropship technology company. By simply going with this kind of method you will lay aside a lot of time playing around and inventory investment to market.

Because they are all fresh goods you don’t need to worry about problems.
Looking at for these issues can be very important as the very first thing the web based purchaser can look with respect to is superior quality pics with the item on sale.

Secondly, if you offer a guarantee or guarantee that the item has been analyzed and is doing work it will certainly add to the general self-assurance to get the consumer to buy your product. Turning out to be a powerful electronics reseller can get completed quite easily your car or truck your homework time effectively first. For no reason jump in to anything that you are not also acquainted with and make sure that you just essentially have concern in the products that you will be reselling or it will end up being extremely tough to maintain push to market electronics via the internet. If you consider most these items first after that reselling gadgets will become gratifying and not to note incredibly money-making.
Some of the best celebrations I've had or enjoyed have been those that highlight others' joys. Today I am delighted to say that a good friend, Jerrie Brock, has a book that is free on Kindle, and it is doing very well, having reached the top 100 books free in all of Kindle after less than 24 hours. It's a wonderful story of the way love can handle the intrusion of the past.
It is, for me, a wonderful story of the resilience of love. You can pick up a copy on Amazon. Here is a geotargeted link for you:
Now, as far as what I, myself, am celebrating in behalf of myself. would the fact that I idiotically did NOT back up my manuscripts on a cloud drive, but did on a 16 gb flash drive, and somehow, through my own stupidity managed to destroy that drive and lose all those manuscripts and yet, through the grace of God was able to retrieve them from a source I had not expected count as a celebration?
OMGosh!!! You must've been frantic losing all your manuscripts!!! I worry about that all the time. So glad you were able to retrieve them!!
Thanks, Cathrina. ...And I KNEW better and had, heaven help me, been lecturing people about the importance of backing things up! My head has been banged against my desk twice now. But all is most well. *whew!*
Glad to hear you got your work back. I recently broke a flash drive of mine as well, but fortunately, I had recently saved everything elsewhere. Whew!
Congrats to Jerrie! And glad to hear you were able to find your manuscripts again--talk about a close call!
What a frightening experience! I'm paranoid about losing my manuscript files and keep multiple flash drive copies. I even have one at my parents' house in case, Heaven forbid, my house ever caught fire. I'm glad you were able to get them back. Congratulations to Jerrie! Sounds like something I should check out.
I am a writer of speculative historical fiction, with elements of mystery, adventure, romance or fantasy. (I enjoy writing them!)

Once a month a near fatal accident will occur in your presence, but everyone involved will be miraculoualy unharmed.
People tend to choke on their words in your presence if they make an intentionally mean and blasphemous statement or joke – this includes you too.
If you say a prayer over someone’s grave you get a general sense for what plane their soul has departed.
When someone dies in your presence you can actually see their soul departing or being dragged into another plane.

When the aasimar draws her weapon against a wicked foe, it ripples with light as if moments from being set aflame. If the aasimar is a sneaky sort, reflections of a tremendous shadowy thunderhead appear instead. Clashing weapons or shields with an ideological opponent causes the aasimar’s weapons and gear to throw a torrent of sparks.
The aasimar never makes misspellings or simple grammatical mistakes in her writing ever. Her handwriting is swift yet flawless. Even the aasimar’s signature is charismatic.
The aasimar can instinctively tell if a written contract presented to her has deceptive intent. The aasimar notices the overall malice of the author hiding within the handwriting and parchment, but the aasimar must use her own wits to discover the precise catch.
The aasimar has a knack with much loved heirlooms. The rust on heirloom armor simply flakes off with a little care, grandpa’s broken clock starts running again with a little tinkering, and a child’s ripped stuffed animal practically sews itself together.
If the aasimar takes ten minutes to attune to a location where a worship service was held in the past day and night, she can hear pieces of the worship service that took place. This sense works even when the aasimar is deaf.
The aasimar always includes a little mud or spit in her medical care. The healing doesn’t work as well when the aasimar leaves them out, but the recipes don’t perform when other people try to make them.
His/Her blood gives advantage to driving out demons from possessed people. It gives off a light smoking effect and visible pain by both parties.
They are constantly followed by a pair of mourning doves that occasionally drop berries in front of them.
Any silk cloth they wear for a day makes it nearly impossible to be zombified when used as a burial shroud.
If they sneeze into a pure white handkerchief, they can open it to release a dove, who flies away. Sneezing into a normal handkerchief turns it pure white
If they focus, their ears are able to hear any prayer or cry for help in 100 feet, no matter the sound level or other distraction.
People who sleep near the aasimar find that they sleep more restfully and contentedly than they have in a long, long time.
Jokes they tell are just funny. No explaining it. Even the worst, most unfunny joke told by the aasimar is met by a wry chuckle.
If they touch the face of a dying enemy, they get advantage on checks made to convince them to release the information the aasimar seeks.
Once per day, re-roll a failed ranged attack made against an enemy – the projectile has inexplicably bounced off of nearby objects to strike the enemy from behind!
They can attune to an object to make it hum an accompanying melody to a song of their choosing, with a range of 30 feet.
If they trip or stumble, they always find something interesting on the ground in front of their face – a gold coin, a perfectly round stone, a piece of wood that kind of looks like a religious figure.
They’ve never lost a thumb war, and can always guess how many fingers you’re hiding behind your back.
People nearby the aasimar can now detect untraceable poisons in their food, with just enough time to react.
Criticisms and observations made by the aasimar convince the target of the comments to turn their life around and improve their situations.
Light always reflects in a way that makes them appear as if they are standing in a column of heavenly light, even if the reflections are not logical.
Their teeth are always pearly white, and never fall out. Their baby teeth grow as the rest of them does, and they always fall perfectly into place throughout the growth process.
Dirt and debris seem to be physically incapable of sticking to their body. Coming into contact with anything of the sort results in the offending material sliding right off of them.
When in love, a faintly colored glow hangs in the air around them and gently reaches out towards the object of their affections whenever they are nearby. The exact color of the glow is unique to the individual aasimar.
Whenever they feel indignant, righteous, or justified, the faint pounding of drums can be heard echoing around the minds of all those nearby. The speed and intensity of the drumming increases with the strength of their passion.
When someone of the opposite gender approaches an Aasimar, they get “hot under the collar” and are more likely to do things for them.
Depending on their ancestry, an Aasimar’s general appearance will be vastly different from another. If they’re a descended of a Celestial or other holy being that was related/associated with the sun, then their body might give off a soft glow at night, their iris may look like an actual sun slowly revolving, and/or they have a greater affinity to heat.
An Aasimar may have two vertical lines going down their back near their shoulder blades as if there use to be wings there.
If an Aasimar lays under an old tree that tree will become more vibrant and alive as well as being able to bear fruit after the Aasimar leaves.
The weather always seems to reflect the mood you’re in that day. It’always sunny when you’re happy; raining when you’re sad; and when you’re angry, there have been horrific storms
You dream of a wonderful, serene place whenever you sleep. If someone sleeps nearby or with you, they join you there.
If you ask a direct and honest question, people are made visibly uncomfortable by telling you a lie or hearing one being told.
Your finger nails mend and clean the things they scratch, can’t break, and are always just the right length for you.
You are not truly an Aasimar, just a common human who has deluded themselves into believing they are. Any magical aasimar traits you use are just you subconsciously casting spells.

Kennedy was under house arrest for a pair of prior bank robberies but apparently cut off his GPS monitoring bracelet to do the new robbery.
“I want all your hundreds, and don’t mess around,” Kennedy commanded. The perp scooped-up $23,000 and made his get-a-way in a taxi.
Cameron cleverly smeared black makeup on his face and wore a pair of glasses in an attempt to conceal his true identity...but no cigar...he was later spotted by witnesses.
Kennedy has finally earned the chance to room with a REAL black guy in a Nevada prison cell. Oh joy.

Malisa (left) and Dion Stevens, of Aliquippa, PA, allegedly waterboarded their daughter as a form of punishment.
Police report the girl had her hands tied behind her back, rags shoved into her mouth and taped into a chair using packing tape. Once secured water was poured over her face muffling her screams and stopping her breathing.
Malisa and Dion plead guilty to a felony count of endangering the welfare of a child and will spend the next seven years on probation. They may get their daughter back, but only under strict supervision.
Oakland is home to homeless, illegals and left-wingers that protect and defend them...but the city also has a love-hate relationship with their own police force.
Hasta Muerte Coffee, an employee-owned co-op, will not serve any cop: "We have a policy of asking police to leave for the physical and emotional safety of our customers and ourselves."
Recently the Hasta Muerte crew even refused to serve a sergeant in uniform who is also the president of the Latino Police Officers Association of Alameda County.
The Oakland Police Officers Association sent the shop a letter asking to open a dialogue about its policy. But why bother? Let's just wish them an armed robbery as a reward, instead.

When Trump's tax cuts became law Nancy pounced onto the podium to re-expose herself as an incontinent elitist. She characterized the tax cuts as “crumbs.” But after being roundly chastised admitted “we are thankful whenever workers get bonuses.”
Gaffing Nancy rushed next to make an appearance on "RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars." The venue seemed to titillate her in an extra special way. Surrounded by men dressed as women Nancy got giddy and pronounce that politicians could learn a thing or two from drag queens.
But we understand where she's sinking into...a dark, confused, befuddled, infantile, doddering, senescent place pampered people who over-stay their welcome permeate.
It took state governments years to nail the sales tax windfall in online shopping. But that tax potential pales compared to the real 'killer app' online. Porn.

Unemployment, scarce skills, STEAM careers and entrepreneurship are many of the words our youth will hear when entering the job market and although there is no magic formula to dictate the right career path, job shadowing is a CRITICAL part of making good career choices.
Far too often kids will say they want to do a job because it sounds cool, without understanding the specific key performance areas of that job. We talk to learners who say “I want to be a Sports Psychologist or Physiotherapist�? and when asking why, the answer will invariably be, “because I like sport!�?
The next generation must understand the skills and jobs of the future and prepare themselves for skill shortages, in order to play a key role in the talent of our country. While remembering that a person needs to love the job they do in order to be successful.
1. Research the company, their vision, mission, goals and company culture to understand if their strategic initiatives resonate with your personal values and beliefs.
2. Ensure you have a basic understanding of the career you are interested in "job shadowing," and make sure that the person you arrange to "shadow" performs the job you want to learn more about.
3. Introduce yourself to the company, provide a brief background of your requirements and expectations for the job shadowing programme and offer to provide a short summary about yourself, including your achievements and interests as well as the reason you are considering this particular company and the career path you are shadowing.
Looking at this simple comparison of the core differences, might help you to understand these two concepts a little better.

Members of the public throughout the country have been reporting sightings of a fireball in the skies this evening.
Large numbers of people reported seeing the fireball as it blazed brightly across the sky around 6pm.
Today FM presenter Tim Kelly told the Herald today he saw the fireball as it seemed to streak across the sky over Dublin.
Valentia Coastguard said it has had reports of sightings from people living in Mullingar, Limerick, Ballybunion and Bantry.
People in Armagh, Craigavon and Omagh reported sightings to the police, and it was also seen on the Glenshane Pass.
The Northern Ireland Coastguard also took calls from people who believed the fireball had landed in Lough Neagh.
In the Republic, Valentia Coastguard said it took calls about sightings in Counties Westmeath, Limerick and Cork.
"We'll collate all the reports, and the more reports we get, the greater the chance of us recovering some of it, if it did fall.
In the mid-sixth century, Europe and Asia experienced the most severe and protracted episode of cooling of the last 2,000 years.
Sources from the time refer to widespread crop failures and famines as the unseasonal weather took hold. The Gaelic Irish Annals recorded 'a failure of bread' from 536 to 539AD.
The eruption theory has many supporters due to sulphate deposits found in ice cores from that period.
This could fit quite neatly with a 2004 paper in the journal of Astronomy and Geophysics, which suggested an object around 2,000ft across could have caused a cooling event on the scale of AD535.
He added that Dr Abbott and others had found 'evidence' of more impact events than astronomer's believe are possible.
Pieces of a giant asteroid or comet that broke apart over Earth may have crashed off Australia about 1,500 years ago, says a scientist who has found evidence of the possible impact craters.
For years Abbott, of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, has argued that V-shaped sand dunes along the gulf coast are evidence of a tsunami triggered by an impact.
Based on the new research, Abbott thinks the two craters were made by an object that split into pieces as it approached Earth.
But some experts are skeptical of Abbott's conclusions, which were presented last December at a meeting of the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco.
One potential problem is the presence of two separate craters at the Gulf of Carpentaria site, said physicist Mark Boslough of Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
In addition, he said, Abbott and other members of an informal association called the Holocene Impact Working Group are finding evidence for more impact events than astronomers calculate should be possible.
"It's pretty hard to imagine where these things could be coming from so that astronomers wouldn't see them."
Instead, it's more likely that the craters found by the working group have volcanic origins, the impact skeptics conclude.
Based on the length of the tail, about 100,000 miles, the collision probably happened just a few months ago, Jewitt said.
When observed by Hubble, P/2010 A2 was about 180 million miles from the sun and 90 million miles from Earth.

But what people are really seeing is the effect of jetliner vapour trails catching winter sunlight, he said.
Borg said he has documented the same phenomenon more than 20 times around the world in recent years.

A meteorite has smashed into the ground in Mexico, leaving a 30 meter (100 feet) wide crater, reports said.
The meteorite impact was in the Ahuazotepec Municipality in Central Mexico between the cities of Puebla and Hidalgo.
The Mexican military was called in to lock down the area where the apparent space rock slammed into the ground.
Initial fears where that the impact was a aircraft crashing to the ground, but that report was later dismissed.

There’s no hotter product in BBQ than pellet grills. Thanks to better marketing, increased exposure and widespread availability in big box stores, more and more people have been introduced to these do-everything set-it-and forget-it cookers. Automated, versatile, and unlike any grill people have used, pellet grills are the perfect one-grill solution, allowing you to smoke authentic BBQ, slow-roast a turkey, grill a steak, or bake pizza all on the same cooker. Yet, for a product billed as the answer to your every backyard cooking need, pellet grills raise plenty of questions.
To provide as many answers as possible in one place, we’ve put together this list of popular pellet grill questions. Hopefully, this FAQ will serve as a sort of Pellet Grill 101, offering all the information you need, along with links to even more resources.
Pellet grills are electric outdoor grills that are fueled by hardwood pellets. The capsule-sized pellets serve as both fuel for cooking food and a flavor enhancer that adds the taste of wood smoke. Incredibly versatile, pellet grills can smoke, grill, roast, bake, and braise. Thanks to a digital control board, they are easy-to-use and automatically maintain the desired cooking temperature for hours on end.
The combination of versatility, flavor and set-it and forget-it technology make pellet grills who want the flavor of a charcoal grill and the ease and accuracy of a kitchen oven. They can smoke, grill, bake, roast, and braise at the touch of a button, infusing food with real wood smoke flavor. Better yet, pellet grills are easy-to-use and automatically maintain their temperature, so you can just set the temperature and walk away.
Because pellet grills combine the abilities of a grill, smoker, and kitchen oven, there’s no limit to what you can cook. You can grill burgers, hot dogs, chicken, seafood and vegetables; smoke authentic BBQ like ribs and brisket; slow-roast a turkey, tenderloin, or prime rib; braise short ribs; you can even bake pizza, bread pudding and blueberry pie.
Pellet grills rely on advanced digital technology working in concert with several mechanical parts. The grill is lit and the cooking temperature is programmed using a digital control board. It uses an algorithm to calculate how many pellets are needed to reach the desired temperature and how often those pellets need to be fed to the fire in order to maintain the temperature. A rotating auger then automatically feeds the pellets from the hopper to the fire, where a fan stokes the flames and distributes heat and smoke throughout the grill. To help maintain an even temperature throughout the entire grill and prevent flare-ups, a diffuser plate sits between the fire pot and grill grate. While the food cooks, the pellet grill continues to drop the perfect amount of pellets needed to maintain the desired temperature.
Pellet grills are incredibly easy-to-use. Just load your favorite pellets into the hopper, program the desired temperature on the controller and put your food on. That’s it. The pellet grill automatically maintains its temperature for as long as there are pellets to burn.
Yes. Pellet grills are electric and require a standard 110v outlet to power the digital control board, auger, and fan.
Yes. Pellet grills go by many different names: pellet smokers, wood pellet grills, electric pellet smokers, electric smoker grills, and wood fired grills, just to name a few. They all refer to the same thing: a versatile electric outdoor cooker that’s fueled by hardwood pellets.
Traeger makes the most well known brand of pellet grills. Joe Traeger invented the pellet grill in 1985 and gave his name to it. Because of a patent, it was also the only pellet grill available for years. Since the patent expired, many different pellet grill brands on the market with more becoming available every year.
No. Although both use electricity, they are different. Electric smokers cook food using a heating element and use wood chips or wood chunks to add smoke. They also tend to have a limited temperature range compared to pellet grills, making them good for smoking and slow-roasting at low temperatures, but not grilling, searing, or anything that requires higher temperatures.
Often called smoker pellets or bbq pellets, the food-grade wood pellets that fuel a pellet grill are produced from 100% hardwood. Made of compressed sawdust sourced from lumber yard, sawmills, and trimmed treetops and limbs, the food grade pellets are all-natural and contain no fillers, although some pellets use vegetable oil as a lubricant.
Never use heating pellets to fuel a pellet grill. Heating pellets may contain impurities such as bark and leaves or could be sourced from softwoods like pine, which may be unhealthy to ingest and can leave food with an off taste. Those impurities may also cause the pellets to burn less cleanly, potentially causing problems with your pellet grill’s performance.
Pellets should be stored in a dry place that’s safe from moisture and humidity. Excessive moisture can make the pellets difficult to light or cause the pellets to swell, which can cause jams in the grill. Many people use a covered 5 gallon bucket for storing their wood pellets.
Yes, it’s okay to leave pellets in the hopper for a limited time after you’re done cooking. However, if you’re not going to be cooking on your pellet grill for several days, you may want to empty the hopper so that they don’t absorb any moisture from the air.
More important than the brand is the quality of the pellets. Many pellet grill makers state that you have to use their pellets on their grill (some even say you’ll void your warranty if you use another brand). This is their way of ensuring only use quality pellets (and selling some pellets in the process). However, any high-quality food-grade pellet will work with any pellet grill.
That being said, many cut-rate pellet brands don’t de-bark their wood, creating inconsistency in the pellets. That can prevent the pellets from burning cleanly, resulting in excessive ash that may interfere with airflow and cause temperature fluctuations. In fact, often when people are having trouble with their pellet grill, cheap pellets are the culprit. How do you know which pellets are okay? Be wary of any pellets with a price that seems too good to be true. A 20 pound bag should cost in the neighborhood of $16 - $23. If you see a bag priced significantly less, be skeptical of the quality.
On average, a pound of pellets lasts between an hour and and an hour-and-a-half when smoking at 250°F in ideal conditions (75°F, no wind). When you increase the cooking temperature, the pellets burn more quickly. In cold weather, you’ll also burn pellets at a faster rate as the grill tries to maintain the desired temperature.
It depends on the pellet grill. The average hopper holds about 18 pounds of pellets, allowing you to smoke for 18-24 hours continuously without having to add pellets.
You can find a huge variety of wood pellets in all kinds of flavors online. Now that pellet grills are becoming more popular, you should also be able to find them in many big box stores, although there won’t be as many brands or varieties to choose from.
Wood pellets come in almost every imaginable hardwood variety. The most popular wood flavors are hickory, apple, cherry, pecan, oak, maple, mesquite and peach. You can pair flavors with specific foods to create a complimentary taste profile or mix them together to create layers of flavor.
The two most popular flavors are hickory and apple. Between the two, you can cook anything. Hickory goes great with poultry and pork, but also has a strong enough flavor to stand up to red meat. Likewise, apple can be used with poultry and pork, but has a sweet and mild profile that pairs well with lighter fare like seafood and vegetables.
Sometimes. However, often it’s a blend of woods. Many wood pellet makers start with a base of oak or alder that has a neutral flavor and provides a consistent burn then add the flavored wood for the desired taste.(Alternatively, some brands use essential oils from the flavored woods.) Because every type of wood burns differently—at different rates and temperatures—using a blend based on oak or alder offers a consistent burn and provide predictable heat output and burn rates. That way, whether you’re cooking with cherry or hickory, you can count on a pound of pellets to cook at roughly the same temperature and for the same length of time.
Because they burn so cleanly, pellet grills produce a cleaner, milder flavor than a traditional offset, which adds smoke flavor through both charcoal and wood chunks. Whether that’s a good or bad thing depends on your preference. Many people who don’t like a heavy smoke on their food prefer the lighter flavor produced by pellet grills. On the other hand, it might be a little light for those accustomed to the more aggressive smoke flavor produced by a traditional smoker.
Cooking at a lower temperature produces more smoke, but some people also use an A-Maze-N Tube with their pellet grill to infuse their food with additional smoke.
Some pellet grills, such as Traeger Grills, have an adjustable knob called the P Setting. The P stands for Pause and it represents the delay between when the grill feeds pellets to the fire. The grill comes with a standard factory P Setting. By adjusting the P Setting, you can increase the pause, which allows the pellets to smolder longer and produce more smoke. However, since you’re also adjusting the pellet feed, adjusting the P Setting can come at the expense of temperature control.
Only use food-grade wood pellets on your pellet grill. Never place wood chips or chunks on or around the fire pot. The fire could grow out of control, producing excessive heat that may damage vital electronics on the grill.
Pellet grills are primarily indirect cookers that use convection to cook food rather than the heat of a direct flame. A deflector plate sits between the fire pot and cooking grate to help keep temperatures consistent throughout the girl while also cutting down on hot spots and eliminating flare ups. Some pellet grills do have a direct grilling option, which allows you to grill over an open flame through an opening in the deflector plate.
You can sear on some pellet grills, but they are the minority. It’s generally accepted you need cook at a minimum of 500°F in order to sear. Because most pellet grills are primarily indirect cookers that top out at 400-425°F, they are not particularly good for searing. However, there are some pellet grills that can reach 500-700°F, as well as some that offer direct grilling options that allow you to sear meat over an open flame.
No. Cold smoking is done at very low temperatures, usually between 70-80°F, but most pellet grills don’t go below 180°F. That limitation makes it fairly difficult to cold smoke on a standard pellet grill. However, some brands like Traeger and Louisiana Grills offer optional accessories that make it possible, and the Fast Eddy’s PG500 has a warming drawer that can be setup for cold smoking.
The digital controller is the brains of the pellet grill. It’s the computer and uses a chip, sensors, circuits, and an algorithm to regulate the pellet grill’s temperature and make sure it accurately maintains the temperature programmed into the control board. The controller is probably the single most important part of your pellet grill, and how good the controller is usually determines how well the pellet grill performs.
While all controllers are digital and utilize algorithms, they aren’t all the same. Some are more sophisticated than others, allowing for better temperature control. Some have knobs, while others have one-touch buttons. Some allow you to set temperatures in 25°F increments, while others can be programmed in 5°F increments. Controllers also differ in how well they maintain that temperature.
A standard digital controller feeds a predetermined amount of pellets to the fire in order to achieve the desired temperature. No matter what the grill’s internal temperature reads it will keep feeding that same amount of pellets. They can maintain a temperature within +/- 25°F. Most of the pellet grills on the market, particularly entry-level models, feature this type of controller.
A variation on the standard controller utilizes limits to tighten the temperature as needed. When the grill goes too far above or below the set temperature, reaching a predetermined limit, the grill will modify its auger cycle slightly to increase or decrease the amount of pellets fed to the fire. This is similar to how a typical kitchen oven works. These controllers can maintain about +/-15°F.
Finally, a PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controller uses a more sophisticated algorithm and a feedback loop to precisely maintain its temperature. A PID controller constantly checks the grill temperature, compares it to the set temperature, and adjusts the pellet feed as necessary, allowing it to maintain a desired temperature within a few degrees.
Very often you can upgrade the controller on an older pellet with an updated controller from the same brand. For instance, you can update an old Traeger 3 position (low-medium-high) controller with a newer Digital Elite or Pro Series controller. However, with some brands, new controllers may only work with specific models or models made after a certain year, so be sure to look for any exceptions or exclusions.
Yes, there are several ways to update older Traeger models. Traeger’s new controllers can be retrofitted to older models. You can also upgrade to a stainless steel fire pot, heat diffuser, and drip pan, which last longer and resist corrosion. Traeger also offers the option to upgrade the cooking and hopper lids to stainless steel.
It’s not recommended. Controllers aren’t universal. Even if the controller works on another grill, it may not perform as expected. Controllers are precisely tuned for a particular pellet grill, taking into account grill size, shape, and airflow, as well as the design of the fan and fire pot. These factors are not consistent from brand to brand, making it unlikely that a digital controller designed for one grill will perform nearly as well on an altogether different pellet grill.
Yes. However, some pellet grills perform better in cold weather than others. Most pellet grills that use a standard non-PID controller have been tuned for ideal conditions. That means when a manufacturer claims their grill can maintain that +/- 20°F, they are referring to a 75°F day with no wind or precipitation. If it’s windy or cold, these grills tend to lose their ability to maintain that temperature range.
Because a PID controller constantly measures its temperature and adjusts its pellet feed to meet the desired temperature, it maintains its temperature just as well in cold weather as under perfect conditions.
Because they are designed for optimum performance in perfect conditions, brands like Traeger recommend using an insulation blanket when temperatures drop below 35°F.
While people always want a black and white answer, the truth is that the best pellet grill is the one that best fits your needs. Depending on budget, location, family size, and usage, that answer can change from person to person. Read more about how to choose the best pellet grill for you.
Stainless steel pellet grills are more durable and will resist rust and corrosion better than a painted steel pellet grill.
While traditional offset smokers rely on beefy construction to hold and maintain their heat, pellet grills rely on their digital controller. A really good controller can accurately maintain the temperature on just about any pellet grill, regardless of its construction. So, if you’re looking at a heavy-duty pellet grill, you may be paying for extra steel you don’t actually need.
That being said, a well-constructed pellet may be more durable and prove to be more fuel efficient in cold weather.
No. Always follow the manufacturer’s guidelines, but a pellet grill shouldn’t need to be seasoned. Seasoning a grill or smoker is way to coat and protect parts that are vulnerable to rust, such as cast iron grates. However, most pellet grills are made from powder-coated steel or stainless steel, eliminating the need for seasoning. Some pellet grills often include instructions to run the grill cook at around 350°F for an hour or so, but this is just to burn off any manufacturing oil, not to season it.
There are some built-in pellet grills available, notably by Memphis Grills. People will sometimes attempt to turn their stand-alone pellet grill into a built-in. However, it’s not recommended and may void your warranty. Installing a pellet grill into a counter top can alter airflow and the amount of heat it retains, affecting performance and potentially damaging the grill. Before undertaking any DIY project, always check with the manufacturer.
Some, but not all, pellet grill controllers have inputs for meat probes, allowing you to monitor the internal temperature of your food on the LCD display. Of those that do have inputs, some include the probes with purchase, while others offer them as an optional accessory.
In addition to monitoring your food’s internal temperature, programmable meat probes allow you to program the finishing temperature into the controller. When meat is done, the controller automatically lowers the grill’s temperature to keep food warm without overcooking it. However, not all meat probes are programmable. Programmable meat probes are generally found on more advanced pellet grills.
There are a few brands that make WiFi pellet grills (e.g. Memphis Grills and the Traeger Timberline). Some pellet grills with WiFi capability allow you to connect directly to your grill—in essence, the pellet grill becomes the network, giving you control within a limited range. Better WiFi pellet grills allow you to connect your grill to home your network, giving you the ability to control your grill via a cloud-based app or web page anywhere you have internet access.
Pellet grills come in every size, including portable pellet grills that are compact enough to be taken camping, tailgating, or just about anywhere, as well as extra large pellet grills that can be used for catering or a small business.
All pellet grills need electricity and so require a power source. There are, however, adapters that allow you to connect to your car battery or a portable 12v battery, allowing you the freedom to take use your pellet grill even when a standard outlet isn’t available.
Like all grills, you should clean your pellet grill regularly, including removing any food and debris from the grates and diffuser plates. However, you should also clean any ash from your fire pot regularly. Ash buildup can affect the pellet grill’s airflow, as well as its ability to ignite the pellets and maintain a consistent temperature.
It’s also a good idea to invest in a grill cover to protect your pellet grill from the elements and keep it looking and cooking like new.
Pellet grills are available at a wide range of prices, from inexpensive bargain-priced models that cost as little as $399 to premium high-end models that cost $5,000 or more. In general, though, a medium-sized pellet grill of decent quality starts at around $699. If you're willing to go smaller, you can get a quality pellet grill for under $500. If you want more cooking space, expect to pay more money. As you add features PID temperature control, a direct grilling option, meat probes, WiFi, and stainless steel construction, the price tag goes up.
No. On average, pellet grills cost more than gas grills because of the digital control board and automation, which require more technology and engineering. The difference in pricing often affects the perceptions and expectations of shoppers. While $400 might get you a high-quality gas grill with a generous cooking area, that same amount will likely only get you a small pellet grill or a cheap pellet grill that’s likely to break down in a year or two.

Tulipomania: The Story of the World's Most Coveted Flower & the Extraordinary Passions It Aroused by Mike Dash
From the context in which the chronicler mentions the tulip house it seems the passage may not be contemporary. The development of the tulip mania Posthumus, “The Tulip Mania in Holland,” pp. 140–42; Krelage, Bloemenspeculatie in Nederland, pp. 42, 49–52. A contemporary chronicler Aitzema, Saken van Staet en Oorlogh, p. 504. Like many of the prices cited by historians of the mania, van Aitzema’s seem to be drawn from the fictionalized Samenspraecken, three pamphlets published in 1637 that purported to record conversations between a tulip dealer and his friend. See chapter 11 for details. Generael der Generaelen van Gouda Krelage, Bloemenspeculatie in Nederland, pp. 35, 49. Schama says that Gouda was one of the cheapest and least spectacular varieties, which is not correct. Later prices quoted for Semper Augustus Ibid., pp. 32–33, 68; Garber, “Tulip-mania,” p. 537; Segal, Tulips Portrayed, pp. 8–9.
It is perfectly possible that methods of this sort were indeed practiced upon occasion, but surely not so cynically and so regularly as to have a significant effect on bulb prices. In truth there was no need to concoct elaborate conspiracy theories to account for the excesses of the bulb craze. The greed, inexperience, and shortsightedness of the florists themselves were all that was required to turn tulip trading into tulip mania. It was the last week of April before the Court of Holland finally concluded its review of the tulip mania. Eight weeks had passed since the growers had met at Amsterdam to propose their own solution to the crisis, three months since the collapse of the flower trade throughout the province. Yet when the learned judges of the Court returned their findings to the States, they began by admitting that they still did not fully understand what had caused the bulb craze or why things had gotten so badly out of hand.
He was the last known victim of the tulip mania. CHAPTER 15 At the Court of the Tulip King The final liquidation of the Dutch mania at the beginning of 1639 left many Hollanders with a distinct aversion to tulips. The episode did not entirely put off the wealthiest collectors of the rarest bulbs; they had never really been involved in the tavern trade in any case and could thus afford to ignore the ridicule that the pamphleteers heaped on those who had found themselves caught up in the frenzy. These few continued to pay high prices for individual bulbs for another hundred years. But interest in tulips otherwise fell away in the United Provinces, now that there was no possibility of making a quick fortune from the flower. Yet the world had not seen the last of tulip mania. Like bubonic plague, it was a strange and complex disease that could rage for a while and then seem to disappear when—like plague—it was really only lying dormant.
A Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds, and the Perils of Financial Innovation by Richard Bookstaber
They were within the paradigms of the Internet demand, so they were purchased as equivalent commodities. The reason so many businesses with no apparent prospects for profitability found takers was that the demand they were fulfilling was speculative, not economic. This dynamic is not new. It has been in play in the markets as far back as the classic tulip bubble in seventeenth-century Holland. WHY TULIP MANIA WASN’T CRAZY Many of the stories related to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s are apocryphal, drawn for sermons on the bitter fruits of avarice, the fodder for object lessons on prudence and frugality. These stories often tried to bring perspective to the phenomenon by introducing hapless, but arguably more rational, outsiders into the middle of the frenzy. One concerns a sailor returning to Amsterdam from sea, unaware of the tulip boom.
Then, within a few short days in mid-February of the next year, the market simply disappeared. 174 ccc_demon_165-206_ch09.qxd 7/13/07 2:44 PM Page 175 T H E B R AV E N E W W O R L D OF HEDGE FUNDS The explanation for the tulip mania usually centers on the irrationality of the market—the incredible excess in paying unbelievable prices for mere flowers. This misses the point. Botany and horticulture were an avocation for many wealthy Europeans in the seventeenth century. And tulips in Holland were among the most sought-after and valued. The rarest, most highly prized tulips were those with irregular colors, or “flames.” They hardly ever reproduced, and when they did, their offspring often did not share the same flaming characteristics as the mother bulb.3 Paying exorbitant sums for these rare flowers was no more unusual than for the very wealthy today to pay fortunes for a Rembrandt (who, by the way, was painting the rich in Amsterdam in 1637). But even before tulip mania seized Holland—and for decades after the bubble burst—such rare bulbs fetched huge sums.
But even before tulip mania seized Holland—and for decades after the bubble burst—such rare bulbs fetched huge sums. In fact, just one month after the common bulbs that fueled the mania could no longer find a buyer, a quantity of rare bulbs was sold in Haarlem, a center of the tulip mania, for more than 10,000 guilders. Tulip mania came neither from these rare bulbs nor from their collectors. The fervor of the collectors may have been a trigger for the bubble, but it was distinct from the event. Rare bulbs were the exclusive province of the wealthy, and in any case were in such short supply that they could not possibly have supported a broad market upsurge. No, the objects of the mania were ordinary bulbs, which were in abundant supply—at least to meet the usual demand. They were purchased by the pound, sight unseen, and were traded for the simple reason that, unlike the rare bulbs, they were available.
A variety of tulip (the Viceroy) whose bulb was one of the most expensive at the time of the tulip mania in Amsterdam, from The Tulip Book of P. Cos, including weights and prices from the years of speculative tulip mania (1637); Wageningen UR Library, Special Collections. finan cial crashe s : w h a t, w h y, a n d w h e n? 9 as the medium of speculation and their price determined the wealth of participants in the tulip business. It is not clear whether the build-up attracted new investment or new investment fueled the build-up, or both. What is known is that as the build-up continued, more and more people were roped into investing their hard-won earnings. The price of the tulip lost all correlation to its comparative value with other goods or services. What we now call the “tulip mania” of the seventeenth century was the “sure thing” investment during the period from the mid-1500s to 1636.
This signals the possible existence of a subtle but nonetheless inﬂuential worldwide cooperativity at times preceding crashes. HISTORICAL CRASHES In the ﬁnancial world, risk, reward, and catastrophe come in irregular cycles witnessed by every generation. Greed, hubris, and systemic ﬂuctuations have given us the tulip mania, the South Sea bubble, the land booms in the 1920s and 1980s, the U.S. stock market and great crash in 1929, and the October 1987 crash, to name just a few of the hundreds of ready examples [454]. The Tulip Mania The years of tulip speculation fell within a period of great prosperity in the republic of the Netherlands. Between 1585 and 1650, Amsterdam became the chief commercial emporium, the center of the trade of the northwestern part of Europe, owing to the growing commercial activity in newly discovered America.
The rather sophisticated presentations, the apparently serious references that seem to justify their origins, and their distinguished proponents provide food for ampliﬁcations serving diverse interests and psychological biases in all layers of society. Notwithstanding the probable confusion it may bring to the mind of readers, it seems appropriate to mention here a recent book by P. M. Garber that reexamined the tulip mania and the Law and South Sea bubbles described in chapter 1 with a fresh and close look at the historical record [153]. His main conclusion is that the fabled elements ritually invoked as underlying speculative bubbles with herding and irrational behavior are just not true. Instead, he defends the view that these events have a possible explanation in terms of fundamental valuation. The interesting part is that Garber views the tulip mania “myth” as originating from a rumor that was progressively strengthened by successive authors using it for their own agenda, such as to support moralistic attacks against “excessive speculation” and, in modern times, to plead for government regulation: “the tulipmania episode is simply a rhetorical device used to put forward an argument that the existence of positi ve feedback s 111 tulipmania proves that markets are crazy.
See Britain sunk in lucre’s sordid charms… ‘All this is madness,’ cries a sober sage: But who, my friend, has reason in his rage? The ruling Passion, be it what it will, The ruling Passion conquers Reason still.72 Throughout history there have been periods where asset prices have moved far out of line with economic fundamentals, driven by what Jonathan Swift, in his ballad The Bubble, called ‘the madness of crowds’. These episodes, ranging from the Dutch tulip mania of the seventeenth century to the Mississippi Bubble in eighteenth-century France, were brilliantly chronicled in Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions by the nineteenth-century journalist Charles Mackay, of which more in a moment.73 If this sounds like a narrow academic debate, it is not. For much of the instability that currently afflicts the world economy is a direct reflection of an aberrant turn in the direction taken by academic economics over the past sixty years or so.
But he added that it was impossible to quash a bubble in a democratic society because it would lead to the Fed’s independence being curtailed.76 As for efficient market theorists such as Eugene Fama, they, too, remain unrepentant. How do they justify themselves? Consider this, first, from the perspective of financial history. In an academic paper, the economist Peter Garber has examined three great bubbles in detail: the Dutch tulip mania, in which contract prices for bulbs soared to astronomical heights and then collapsed; the Mississippi Bubble in France, a scheme engineered by the Scottish adventurer John Law which enjoyed a monopoly over French colonial trade and ended in a speculative frenzy fuelled by the issue of paper money; and the South Sea Bubble in England, where speculation hinged on the South Sea Company’s modest trading rights in the West Indies and South America, together with its purchase of the national debt in exchange for an annual payment from the Exchequer.77 On the seventeenth-century tulip euphoria, Garber argues that Charles Mackay failed to discuss what the fundamental price of tulips should have been, pointing out that there is a standard pricing pattern for new varieties of flowers that holds even today.
This is intended to address the efficient market theorists’ argument that a bubble is an impossibility because market participants would detect any valuation anomaly and immediately bet against it, bringing prices back to ‘efficient’ levels. Shiller has also produced detailed statistical work on stock prices and dividends going back to 1871, in which he finds that the volatility of prices relative to underlying corporate performance is far more than can be explained by efficient market theory.82 Charles Mackay is interestingly in tune with these insights of behavioural finance, even if he is prone to exaggerate. Writing of the tulip mania, he said: Many individuals grew suddenly rich. A golden bait hung temptingly out before the people, and one after the other, they rushed to the tulip-marts, like flies around a honey pot. Everyone imagined that the passion for tulips would last for ever, and that the wealthy from every part of the world would send to Holland, and pay whatever prices were asked for them. The riches of Europe would be concentrated on the shores of the Zuyder Zee, and poverty banished from the favoured clime of Holland.
They took the foreign investment to mean that all of Europe was catching on to their tulip craze, and so they doubled down: ordinary people sold their belongings, mortgaged their houses, and exhausted their savings to participate in the tulip market. Tulips bulbs are typically planted in the fall and then harvested in the late spring. But winter was the prime time for speculation because this was when would-be investors had the least information about the supply for the coming year: the old bulbs had been planted but the new bulbs and cut flowers were not yet available. It was during the winter of 1636–37 that tulip mania (as it is now called) reached its height. That winter, a single bulb sold for as much as 5,200 guilders (more than $60,000 for one tulip bulb!). And then one day in February 1637, at an otherwise ordinary tulip auction in Haarlem, the bidding stopped too soon. Apparently no one had invited the next batch of tulip fools. That day, prized tulips sold for just a fraction of what they had even one day before.
Herding and similar phenomena — the kinds of behavior that lead to bubbles — seem to be an ever-present aspect of human psychology. No one wants to be left out, and so we tend to copy one another. Ordinarily, though, we do not act like lemmings. Even if we look to one another for guidance, we do not usually follow blindly. The question, then, is why under some circumstances herding seems to take over. How does something like tulip mania strike? When do the normal mental brakes that would keep someone from spending his entire life savings on a tulip bulb give out? Sornette doesn’t have an answer to this question, though he has developed some models that predict which circumstances will lead herding effects to become particularly strong. What Sornette can do is identify when herding effects have taken over. This amounts to identifying when a speculative bubble has taken hold in a particular market and to predicting the probability that the bubble will pop before a certain fixed time (the critical point).

You can only set your position size and decide whether and when to enter or exit your trades. Most traders feel jittery entering a trade. Their judgment becomes clouded after they join the crowd. Caught up in crowd emotions, many traders deviate from their plans and lose money. Experts on Crowds Charles Mackay, a Scottish barrister, wrote his classic book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, in 1841. He described several mass manias, including the Tulip Mania in Holland in 1634 and the South Seas investment bubble in England in 1720. The tulip craze began as a bull market in tulip bulbs. The long bull market convinced the prosperous Dutch that tulips would continue to appreciate. Many abandoned their businesses to grow tulips, trade them, or become tulip brokers. Banks accepted tulips as collateral and speculators profited. Finally, that mania collapsed in waves of panic selling, leaving people destitute and the nation shocked.
A trend can continue as long as bulls and bears remain in conflict. A high degree of consensus precedes reversals. When the crowd becomes highly bullish, get ready to sell, and when it becomes strongly bearish, get ready to buy. This is the contrary opinion theory, whose foundations were laid by Charles Mackay, a Scottish barrister. His classic book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (1841) describes the infamous Dutch Tulip Mania and the South Seas Bubble in England. Humphrey B. Neill in the United States applied the theory of contrary opinion to stocks and other financial markets. In his book, The Art of Contrary Thinking, he made it clear why the majority must be wrong at the market's turning points: prices are established by crowds, and by the time the majority turns bullish, there aren't enough new buyers to support a bull market.

In the 1960s and 1970s, as EMT was being developed, Hyman Minsky was writing about booms leading to euphoria, panic, and busts. Charles Kindleberger’s Manias, Panics and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises, was hugely popular when it came out in 1978. British journalist and essayist Walter Bagehot had written about financial crises in Lombard Street, London’s financial district, back in the latter half of the nineteenth century. And who hasn’t heard of the extraordinary tulip mania in the Netherlands of the 1630s, popularized in Charles Mackay’s 1841 book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds? Of course, we don’t need to look that far back, considering that we’ve all lived through two major manias of our own, the dot-com bubble and the housing boom and bust. It would appear that uncertainty with all its promise and perils is very much a part of our economic system.

Meanwhile banks become unwilling to lend, and indeed demand repayment of their loans, further weakening the supply/demand balance. In the case of American housing, homeowners walked away from their loans or faced foreclosure from the banks, leaving behind a glut of empty houses that weighed on the markets. Charles Kindleberger, a great historian of bubbles, used the Minsky model to examine everything from tulip mania in the seventeenth century to John Law’s system and the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. He showed they followed a template of a ‘displacement’ – some development like a war or technological change – credit expansion, over-trading (the final speculative phase), followed by distress (as some investors try to exit) and revulsion, as all who took part are berated for their stupidity. The sub-prime boom fits the pattern.
Close your eyes and you can hear the London traders of four centuries ago laughing about the idea of ledger money as ridiculous while considering tulip speculation to be a perfectly reasonable commercial venture. After all, tulips are in the end pretty and people like them, whereas no one would accept marks on paper rather than bullion. Yet it was in Amsterdam that an entirely new kind of bank was founded: the Amsterdam bourse began to develop new kinds of trading supported by that bank, and the well-known crisis caused by tulip mania led to regulated derivatives markets (Jay 2000). This came about because of an innovation in the relationship between banks and markets. There had been calls for some sort of ‘payments bank’ (that is, a financial institution that did not extend credit, and therefore could not fail, but that could facilitate value transfers between people) as far back as the fourteenth century in Venice. This was in recognition of the difference between a bank to facilitate transfers in space and a bank to facilitate transfers in time (which involves the provision of credit).
The existence of this marketplace gave the city an immediate comparative advantage because of its access to information. In modern terms it meant that merchants were able to allocate their capital in the most efficient ways. Among other things, the bourse traded derivatives. Futures trading in the Amsterdam markets had its origin in the sixteenth century and futures were traded on the Amsterdam exchange just like any other commodity. Derivatives fed the tulip mania and the subsequent crash, although the reasons for the crisis and crash are not as clear as you might think. Some observers see the tulip market’s collapse as a response to financial regulation, not market fundamentals (see ‘Was tulipmania irrational?’, The Economist, 4 October 2013). Government officials, who were themselves speculating on the markets, were planning a rule change to convert futures contracts into options, which would mean that people who had undertaken to buy tulip bulbs in the future could pay a small amount to cancel the contracts if the price was not in their favour.
The hidden force that drives speculative money to buy into a winner is the same as that which causes us to choose to dine in a restaurant that has a queue coming out of the door. Success has an allure. But not all success will last forever. Investors seem to be hard-wired to follow the herd, so we need to be careful when riding a winning stock. Charles Mackay, in his 1841 book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, examined three bubbles (the 18th-century Mississippi project, the South Sea bubble, and the 17th-century Dutch tulip mania). His research showed how people lose the ability to think rationally under pressures of crowd behaviour. At the height of a bull market or in the depths of a bear market people become herd-minded. And it is rarely safe to be relying on irrationality for profit for too long. “I learned that even though markets look their very best when they are setting new highs, that is often the best time to sell.
You read the paper every day, and enough stories have appeared to convince you that bitcoin is real, that some entrepreneurs, including the Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame, expect to make a lot of money from it. But the details don’t add up. You get it by doing math problems? No? By having your computer do math problems? How can that possibly work? At this stage, phrases like Ponzi scheme and tulip mania enter your mind. Stage Three: Curiosity. You’ve kept reading. It becomes clear that many people, even some seemingly sensible people such as Internet pioneer Marc Andreessen, people with a track record for being right about this stuff, are genuinely excited by it. But why all the fuss? Okay, it’s digital money, it may work, but what difference is that going to make to regular people? And why are people so heated up about it?
A positive feedback loop is how Silicon Valley would describe it, with the higher prices begetting more interest in cryptocurrencies, more investment capital flowing into bitcoin, more innovation and more interest and benefits for the sector, which should push the price even higher. Skeptics could equally call it a bubble—and many sought to do so once the price retreated below $500 in the first half of 2014, using it to justify their depictions of “tulip mania” around bitcoin. But even at those newly lower levels, bitcoin was still higher than any level it had held in its entire history before mid-November 2013. That’s left many miners, bitcoin entrepreneurs, and businesses that have earned the cryptocurrency for a year or more markedly wealthier. The choices they make in investing that wealth have encouraged still more innovation in the sector and have driven prices for bitcoin-related digital properties higher, much as the NASDAQ stock boom fueled the mania for IT start-ups and stocks in the late 1990s.
Culture and Prosperity: The Truth About Markets - Why Some Nations Are Rich but Most Remain Poor by John Kay
In Greek and Roman times and in the Middle Ages, business was conducted by individuals, or partnerships of people who knew each other well-who else would take on the risks? When larger partnerships were formed, speculation and fraud followed, and after the South Sea bubble large-scale commercial organization was prohibited. The objective was to restrict investment to ventures the participants might expect to understand. But throughout history, from the tulip mania of 1636 to the dot-com bubble of 1999, greed and gullibility have defeated that purpose. The precursors of the modern corporation were international trading companies, such as the English East India Company or the Dutch VOC. These companies acted as both businesses and governments in the areas they colonized and controlled territories larger than the native countries from which they came. The development of canals from 1790, and railroads from 1820, required the creation of domestic enterprises operating on a large scale, in Europe and the United States.
Optimism and risk sharing enable many more new businesses to be started and contribute to the pluralism of a market economy. Information asymmetries extend more widely. Those who invest with Antonio will not be a random sample of the population. Investors will be those who know Antonio or believe they do. Investors, like those telecom shareholders, will be those who are more than averagely optimistic about the prospects for Antonio's trade. In all investment booms-from the tulip mania to the dot-com mania-money is raised cheaply from people who expect high returns but do not in the end receive them. Investment banks have become skilled in managing the issue process so as best to appeal to "irrationalities" in the minds of potential investors-the attraction of "prospects," their aversion to even small losses. In chapter 14, I described how the stock market had developed, not as a primary means of raising capital for new businesses, but as a market for the sale and resale of secondary participations.
In practice, though, it never seems to be quite the moment for it. After all, things are going so well. The convincer is precisely that: wholly convincing. Why quit while you’re ahead, if you are certain you’ll remain ahead in the future? The ebullient optimism that doesn’t see its own demise isn’t a function of modern markets, either; it’s far older and more pervasive than that. One of the most famous bubbles in history was the great Dutch tulip mania—tulpenwoede—of the early seventeenth century. So desired were the flowers, and so high their price, that in the 1630s a sailor was jailed for mistaking one for an onion and eating it. While the story is likely apocryphal, the sentiment is not. At the bubble’s peak in 1637, some bulbs had increased in price twentyfold in a three-month period. Semper Augustus, considered particularly desirable, cost about a thousand guilders in the 1620s.
It was not unique because entrepreneurs now recognized opportunities to produce and sell what people demanded: that is an old economic habit. Nor was it different from past entrepreneurship because it could raise capital to fund new enterprises. Merchants, explorers, and voyagers had done that for centuries, but the fortunes of the trade they created never spread widely in the economy. The premodern economic system was full of speculative capital and asset bubbles, such as the Dutch tulip mania in the 1600s or the French Mississippi finance bubble in the 1700s. All past ages have had their own financial sharks and Bernie Madoff-type hustlers. A defining characteristic of modern capitalist entrepreneurship, to follow economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron, was rather one of time: investments in big innovation needed far longer to generate expected economic gains. One of the factors separating past entrepreneurs from the new generation emerging after the modernization of entrepreneurship was the latter’s understanding of uncertainty as a necessary ingredient to build private and societal profits.42 The twentieth century witnessed ideological experiments with other economic systems, but capitalism, for all its faults, has stood the test of time.

“The human brain responds to high-stakes trading just as it does to the lure of sex. And the riskier trades get, the more the brain craves them.” “Social conformity drives human beings. Even if the group is wrong, people go along.” Sounds about right, right? Consider the question: Does raw human emotion dictate financial decisions, or are we rational calculators of our self-interest? At the peak of tulip mania in Holland, in February 1637, single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman.2 The idea that we behave irrationally when it comes to money may not seem radical, but it challenges the dominant University of Chicago economic philosophy that has framed business and government for fifty years. Their campus has given rise to more Nobel Prize winners in economics than any other institution.
Whereas the English East India Company initially treated each voyage as a separate venture, with different shareholders, the VOC made all the voyages part of a twenty-one-year venture (something the English imitated a decade later). The VOC’s charter also explicitly told investors that they had limited liability. Dutch investors were the first to trade their shares at a regular stock exchange, founded in 1611, just around the corner from the VOC’s office. All the Amsterdam hub needed to prove its capitalistic credentials was a market crash, which duly arrived with tulip mania in 1636–1637. If the Dutch set the fashion for stock-market speculation at home, they also set the tone for competitive imperialism abroad. The VOC’s first voyage had the simple instructions: “Attack the Spanish and Portuguese wherever you find them.” Within forty years, the VOC had established itself as the dominant force in the Moluccan Spice Islands, driving the Portuguese away and forcing the English to concentrate on India.
But there are lessons to be had from the booms and busts of previous eras. In particular, you should consider your options before jumping onto bandwagon businesses. To that end I can recommend Devil Take the Hindmost by Edward Chancellor (Macmillan, 2000), for its fine introduction to the subject of wild booms and busts through the ages. The author is an ex-Lazard merchant banker who understands his material. His book covers a grand sweep from the Dutch tulip-mania of the 1630s to the Japanese bubble economy of the 1980s. It shows that when it comes to making investments, we are doomed to endlessly repeat our mistakes. Every era brings forth innovations, which offer great reward and attract risk capital. The substantial initial profits encourage a rush of capital and company valuations get out of control. Things then inevitably come down to earth, with drastic suffering the result.
Digging into the data, he found in Iceland the outlines of what was so clearly a historic act of financial madness that it belonged in a textbook. “The Perfect Bubble,” Aliber calls Iceland’s financial rise, and he has the textbook in the works: an updated version of Charles Kindleberger’s 1978 classic, Manias, Panics, and Crashes. Aliber is editing the new edition. In it, Iceland, he decided back in 2006, would now have its own little box, along with the South Sea Bubble and tulip mania—even though Iceland had yet to crash. For him the actual crash was a mere formality. Word spread in Icelandic economic circles that this distinguished professor at Chicago had taken a special interest in Iceland. In May 2008, Aliber was invited by the University of Iceland’s economics department to give a speech. To an audience of students, bankers, and journalists, he explained that Iceland, far from having an innate talent for high finance, had all the markings of a giant bubble, but he spoke the technical language of academic economists.
Stocks and bonds are the two biggest single fields of global investment, reaching into every corner of economic life. At the beginning of the new millennium, however, both of them were going through an odd patch. The stock market had undergone a spectacular bubble in Internet and new-economy stocks. Some of what was happening seemed to belong to a classic hysteria equal to that of the great historical bubbles such as the Dutch tulip mania, the South Sea bubble, or the nineteenth-century bubble in railway stocks. The broad rules of these bubbles and implosions are well known. They were first systematized by the economist Hyman Minsky, and their best-known popular formulation is in the classic text by Charles P. Kindleberger, Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises. The basic pattern of these manias is that a real phenomenon comes along (overseas exploration, railways, the Internet), is latched onto by investors, is blown out of all proportion, and continues surging upward anyway, so more investors pile in on the basis of what’s now called “greater fool theory.”
These profits would then be “reported” to investors, which would drive the stock higher. Circular and dangerously wrong reasoning. Enron would pull this scam almost 300 years later. England was ripe for manipulation. At the exact same time, thanks to a Brit named John Law, the French were in the midst of their own speculative bubble: The Mississippi Company was worth more than all of the gold and silver in France. The Dutch tulip mania of the 1630’s didn’t quite kill off speculation there. Between the fall of 1719 and the summer of 1720, close to two hundred joint stock companies, many of them purely speculative, went public. As an inducement to Parliament, Blunt offered a fee of 7.5 million pounds back to the Treasury for the rights to do the exchange. In early 1720, Parliament agreed to Blunt’s swap proposal. It didn’t hurt that he paid off the secretary of the treasury and the Duchess of Kendal, with whom King George I was doing his own speculating.
Call options used by tulip buyers ensured a good price on delivery, and puts could be used to provide sellers with a predictable price for their product upon harvest. While these mechanisms acted at first as a way to ensure predictability for buyers and sellers of tulips, it soon became obvious to speculators that profits could be had. As speculators wrote puts and calls, it would not be long before gyrations in tulip mania caused mismatches in options and delivered prices and quantities that those speculators on the losing end could not cover. Such breakdowns in market-making also created breakdowns in trust in options and in financial markets in general. By the 1600s and 1700s, large global trading companies, such as the South Seas Trading Company, were contributing to an options frenzy on their securities. To curry favor from politicians in exchange for helpful legislation, company representatives offered the politicians warrants or the right to buy company-issued stock at a later date but at a predetermined price.
House of Debt: How They (And You) Caused the Great Recession, and How We Can Prevent It From Happening Again by Atif Mian, Amir Sufi
His colleague and Nobel laureate Robert Solow compared Kindleberger to Darwin on the Beagle: “collecting, examining, and classifying interesting specimens . . . it was Kindleberger’s style as an economic historian to hunt for interesting things to learn, not pursue a systematic agenda.”2 The culmination of Kindleberger’s massive data collection on bubbles—Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises—is one of the most influential books written in economic history. The book is a tour de force: it covers bubbles going back to the tulip mania in the seventeenth-century Netherlands to the commercial real estate boom before Japan’s “Lost Decade,” to the 1998 financial crisis spurred by the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management. It represents one of the most systematic and large-scale explorations of bubbles and financial crises ever written. The Science of Bubbles Even though Kindleberger didn’t set out to prove any one theory, his close examination of the historical data led him to strong conclusions.
According to his data, in 2001 it was estimated that only 1 to 2 per cent of the fiber optic cable buried under Europe and the United States had so far been turned on (or ‘lit’). Courtappointed receivers of bankrupted telecommunications companies were recovering an average of less than 10 per cent of the original cost of building the networks when they tried to sell the assets. 156 The cemetery of ‘dot.coms’ after the NASDAQ collapse is another witness to the madness of late-Frenzy. 152. Neither the Tulip mania of the 1630s nor the South Sea Bubble of 1720 qualifies in this particular sense. In fact there are many collective psychology phenomena associated with speculative behavior, but not related to the assimilation of technological revolutions in a capitalist context. There are also many other financial crises in capitalism, following particular episodes of speculation, which have more immediate explanatory factors. 153.

True, Locke’s materialism also came to be broadly accepted—even to be the watchword of the age.83 Mainly, though, the reliance on gold and silver seemed to provide the only check on the dangers involved with the new forms of credit-money, which multiplied very quickly—especially once ordinary banks were allowed to create money too. It soon became apparent that financial speculation, unmoored from any legal or community constraints, was capable of producing results that seemed to verge on insanity. The Dutch Republic, which pioneered the development of stock markets, had already experienced this in the tulip mania of 1637—the first of a series of speculative “bubbles,” as they came to be known, in which future prices would first be bid through the ceiling by investors and then collapse. A whole series of such bubbles hit the London markets in the 1690s, in almost every case built around a new joint-stock corporation formed, in imitation of the East India Company, around some prospective colonial venture.
On the other hand, it does seem that the moment a significant portion of the population begins to actually believe this, and particularly, starts treating credit institutions as if they really will be around forever, everything goes haywire. Note here how it was the most sober, cautious, responsible capitalist regimes—the seventeenth-century Dutch Republic, the eighteenth-century British Commonwealth—the ones most careful about managing their public debt—that saw the most bizarre explosions of speculative frenzy, the tulip manias and South Sea bubbles. Much of this seems to turn on the nature of national deficits and credit money. The national debt is, as politicians have complained practically since these things first appeared, money borrowed from future generations. Still, the effects have always been strangely double-edged. On the one hand, deficit financing is a way of putting even more military power in the hands of princes, generals, and politicians; on the other, it suggests that government owes something to those it governs.
Debunking Economics - Revised, Expanded and Integrated Edition: The Naked Emperor Dethroned? by Steve Keen
But Bentham’s more important sleight of mind was to ignore the macroeconomic argument that the legislative ceiling to the rate of interest improved the overall quality of investment by favoring ‘sober people’ over ‘prodigals and projectors.’ The historical record favored Smith. The seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are awash with examples of projectors promoting fantastic schemes to a gullible public. The most famous have entered the folklore of society: the Tulip Mania, the South Sea Bubble, the Mississippi Land Scheme (Mackay 1841). What has not sunk in so deeply is that the financial panics that occurred when these bubbles burst frequently ruined whole countries.6 However, the tide of social change and the development of economic theory favored Bentham. The statutes setting maximum rates were eventually repealed, the concept of usury itself came to be regarded as one of those quaint preoccupations of a more religious age, and modern economics extended Bentham’s concept that ‘putting money out at interest, is exchanging present money for future’ (Bentham 1787).
Although this book is not a cultural history of finance—in many instances, artists, writers, moral philosophers, dramatists, and even comedians have interpreted financial markets, and this in turn has influenced the course of these markets’ development. The criticism of finance as a tool of exploitation on moral grounds goes back to Babylonian times. The discomfort that society has felt with the complexity and abstraction of financial tools has stimulated rich artistic interpretations that in turn shaped cultural attitudes. We sometimes turn to art for a perspective, and artists’ views on finance—from seventeenth-century tulip mania prints to the twentieth-century murals about commerce in New York’s Rockefeller Center—depict finance in the context of familiar cultural symbols. The artist’s vision is an integral part of the narrative of this book. Much of my research in finance has been directed toward a scholarly audience; however, one motivation for writing this book is the hope that a broader audience will be curious about the origins of a toolkit that we all share and a mindset that seems at times difficult and perhaps unnatural.
Despite these isolated details, however, the crowd itself is a unified force in the picture—the obvious implication being that the financial crisis derived from the madness of the mob, the tendency of people to get swept up and lose their reason. Several of the prints in the book hearken back to earlier Dutch art. For example, borrowing freely from Peter Brueghel and Hieronymus Bosch, The Great Mirror of Folly artists portrayed loony investors having the stone of folly extracted from their feverish brains, or as fools doomed to perpetually drift in lunatic reverie. One print of the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s is simply reproduced in the volume to draw the direct analogy between the episode of bulb speculation and the great financial crash. The bulb print is a figure of a giant, empty cap—suggesting the loss of the head and mind to speculative passions. FIGURE 24. Engraving from The Great Mirror of Folly, 1720, depicting the global market bubble on its path from the coffeehouse, pulled by the six great companies.
If you’re this kind of investor, you are more likely to hold shares relatively briefly, and you are likely to gravitate toward stocks that see rapid swings in value. You are also likely to be constantly on the lookout for information — even rumors — that could tip you off to impending price swings in particular stocks. When lots of people engage in speculative investment, the likely result is a series of occasional manias or bubbles. A classic example is the 17th-century Dutch tulip mania, when trade in tulip bulbs assumed bubble proportions; at its peak in early February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than ten times the annual income of a skilled craftsman.17 Just days after the peak, tulip bulb contract prices collapsed and speculative tulip trading virtually ceased. More recently, in the 1920s, radio stocks were the bubble du jour while the dot-com or Internet bubble ran its course a little over a decade ago (1995–2000).
Even if you think capitalism is working pretty well despite the crisis—and after all, there have been many crises in financial markets over the centuries—it has to be acknowledged that there is at least a crisis of legitimacy. Majorities of people in many countries do not believe, at present, that markets are doing a good job of organizing the economy. The immediate crisis is probably the least interesting way in which markets are failing at the moment, however. Financial crises do indeed recur in market economies, at least as far back as the tulip mania of the seventeenth century.17 The economist Hyman Minsky has argued that there is an internal cycle of capitalism that guarantees there will be banking crises from time to time.18 There have been a few in recent decades—in 1993–94, 1997–98, in 2001, as well as 2007–8. Each one is different, and the most recent crisis has been distinctive in involving the world’s very biggest banks. So each carries new lessons, the lesson from the most recent being that regulators have allowed banks to grow too big.
The subprime mortgage crisis has also generated a large literature, and in view of its magnitude and momentous implications, surely much more will be written. But some of the key conclusions are not hard to foresee: markets are prone to bubbles, unregulated leverage creates systemic risk, lack of transparency undermines confidence, and early intervention is crucial when financial markets are going belly-up. Didn’t we know all this from as long ago as the famous tulip mania of the seventeenth century? These crises transpired not because they were unpredictable but because they were unpredicted. Economists (and those who listen to them) had become overconfident in their preferred narrative of the moment: markets are efficient, financial innovation transfers risk to those best able to bear it, self-regulation works best, and government intervention is ineffective and harmful.
You spend your days talking to people who don’t seem any smarter than you—some don’t seem very bright at all—and yet they are gazillionaires, while you’re an underpaid hack who can barely pay his bills. I wasn’t sure whether to resent them or envy them. In the end I felt a bit of both. Of course the dotcom bubble finally blew up, and I felt a little bit vindicated and even a bit relieved. Now everything could go back to normal. I figured the dotcom bubble had been a historical anomaly akin to the Dutch tulip mania of the seventeenth century, something we would never see again in our lifetime. Instead another one is taking shape. People my age, who remember the first dotcom bubble, are walking around San Francisco feeling like the character played by Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. We’ve lived through this before. We reckon it will all end in tears, just like the first one did. The young kids running these new companies, however, have almost no memory of the first crash.
The End of Theory: Financial Crises, the Failure of Economics, and the Sweep of Human Interaction by Richard Bookstaber
I will argue that these are the reasons for using agent-based models, models that allow for individuals who are each plotting their own course, making adjustments along the way, and affecting the world and others through their actions. Agent-based models do this by applying the simulation approach that is rooted in the analysis of complex and adaptive systems. These are models that respect our very human limits. Let me summarize four broad phenomena that are endemic to financial crises as they have been evolving since the tulip mania of seventeenth-century Holland. I will treat these in more detail in chapters 3 through 6. 1. Emergent phenomena. You’re cruising along the highway when traffic jams up, and you wonder: Is there an accident up ahead? Or maybe road repair? Then, five minutes and a mile later, you’re again moving along smoothly without any obvious reason for the jam. There are less benign versions of transitory congestion, like the flow of fans exiting a concert or soccer match that suddenly turns into a stampede.
So many new varieties were being found every day that no collector could ever rest—orchids were an endless preoccupation. Once the vogue for orchids began, the prices paid for the plants, the measures taken to obtain them, and the importance attached to them took on an air of madness. This Victorian obsession, this “or-chidelirium,” was a rapacious desire. In intensity, it was similar to the Dutch tulip mania of the 1630s, which reached its zenith in 1637, when the rights to a tulip bulb named Viceroy were sold at auction for a farm’s worth of valuable goods including six loads of grain, four oxen, eight hogs, twelve sheep, wine, beer, and a thousand pounds of cheese. The most valued tulips were those with brilliant streaks and stripes of colors, then thought to be the mark of distinction, and now known by botanists to be the evidence of a devastating flower virus spread by aphids.

Most losses occurred when promoters, either fraudulent, stupid or simply over-optimistic, obtained huge sums of money for lines that were never completed so that investors lost all their cash. Investors were most vulnerable during the railway manias which raged through different countries at various times and were swept up in the rush simply because everyone else seemed to think it was a good idea. Railway bubbles simply fit into the history of similar scandals from the Dutch tulip mania of 1637 to the recent banking crisis. There’s no shortage of elegantly embellished but completely valueless railway company share certificates still adorning living-room walls, dating from the various railway manias of the nineteenth century. However, it was when governments became involved that unbelievably huge sums could be purloined by corrupt promoters and the world centre for such activity was the United States, where several later scams dwarfed even the dodgy dealings outlined in Chapter 6 during the construction of the first transcontinental.
It could be that changes in either supply or demand warrant a much higher price. A bubbly market is one that has lost its connection to supply and demand. In such cases—as in the late ’90s, when fundamentally worthless Internet stocks claimed valuations of tens of billions of dollars; or in the 1630s in Holland when, at the peak of a mania, twelve acres of land were offered for a single bulb of Semper Augustus tulip—prices are floated on sheer froth.10 During the tulip mania, Dutch traders met at taverns and contracted for the future delivery of bulbs of a flower regarded as a luxury and a status symbol. Precipitously, the bubble collapsed, and tulips once more were merely tulips. The question posed about bubbly markets has been the same ever since: What is the real price, or the price justified by supply and demand? In 2005, to get a fix on the housing market, Fannie Mae’s managers overlaid a graph of prices with that of incomes over the previous generation.

More than that, the attitude of educators toward printed textbooks and of business people toward written communication underwent a discernible change; avant-garde philosophers took to hailing xerography as a revolution comparable in importance to the invention of the wheel; and coin-operated copying machines began turning up in candy stores and beauty parlors. The mania—not as immediately disrupting as the tulip mania in seventeenth-century Holland but probably destined to be considerably farther-reaching—was in full swing. The company responsible for the great breakthrough and the one on whose machines the majority of these billions of copies were made was, of course, the Xerox Corporation, of Rochester, New York. As a result, it became the most spectacular big-business success of the nineteen-sixties. In 1959, the year the company—then called Haloid Xerox, Inc.
If AT&T stock rose above the strike price before October 15 by an amount greater than the option premium, the option would generate a profit. In fact, the potential profit on the option would be limitless. The option on AT&T stock was selling for $2.50 on June 6, 1995. Why $2.50? Resolving Paccioli's unfinished game of balla was kid stuff compared to this! We can only wonder whether two quants like Pascal and Fermat could have come up with an answer-and why they did not even try. The Dutch tulip mania, a striking example of what happens when "oldfashioned human hunches" take over, had occurred only twenty years before Pascal and Fermat first laid out the principles of probability theory; the memory of it must still have been vivid when they began their historic deliberations. Perhaps they ignored the challenge of valuing an option because the key to the puzzle is in the price of uncertainty, a concept that seems more appropriate to our own times than it may have seemed to theirs.
“That’s just pretty wild, right?” Morehead said. “I think when they dig up our society, all Planet of Apes–style, in a couple of centuries, Bitcoin is probably going to have had a greater impact on the world than Urban Outfitters. We’re still in early days.” Many bankers, economists, and government officials dismissed the Bitcoin fanatics as naive promoters of a speculative frenzy not unlike the Dutch tulip mania four centuries earlier. On several occasions, the Bitcoin story bore out the warnings of the critics, illustrating the dangers involved in moving toward a more digitized world with no central authority. Just a few weeks before Morehead’s gathering, the largest Bitcoin company in the world, the exchange known as Mt. Gox, announced that it had lost the equivalent of about $400 million worth of its users’ Bitcoins and was going out of business—the latest of many such scandals to hit Bitcoin users.
Psychologists call this penchant to follow the crowd the herding instinct—the tendency of individuals to adapt their thinking to the prevailing opinion. The Internet bubble has many precedents. In 1852, Charles Mackay wrote the classic Extraordinary Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, which chronicled a number of financial bubbles during which speculators were driven into a frenzy by the upward movement of prices: the South Sea bubble in England and the Mississippi bubble in France around 1720 and the tulip mania in Holland a century earlier.8 Let me read you my favorite passage from the book. See if you can relate with this: We find that whole communities suddenly fix their minds upon one subject, and go mad in its pursuit; that millions of people become simultaneously impressed with one delusion and run after it. . . . Sober nations have all at once become desperate gamblers, and risked most of their existence upon the turn of a piece of paper. . . .
These varying explanations resulted in much confusion and contributed to the general failure of most big financial institutions to see the credit crisis looming before 2008. Embarrassed by that failure, the Bank for International Settlements, the European Central Bank, the IMF, and other authorities began to look at the problem anew, and, by 2011, they had moved along separate paths to similar conclusions. One strong thread in their research linked the major credit crises going back to the Great Depression of the 1930s and in some cases even to the “tulip mania” that tripped up Holland in the 1600s. The precursor of all these crises—and thus the most powerful indicator of a coming crisis—was that domestic private credit had been growing faster than the economy for a significant length of time. This is a very important clue. The authorities also reached another surprising conclusion: Although the total size of a nation’s debt—meaning the total of government and private-sector debt—does matter for the economy’s prospects, the clearest signal of coming financial trouble comes from the pace of increase in that debt.
De Vries’ more plausible story is that, as David Hume put it, “Everything in the world is purchased with labor; and our passions are the only cause of labor” — that is, greater variety of goods, for which de Vries offers a book full of evidence, tempted early modern Dutch and English people to work 303 days per year in the eighteenth century as against only 255 days in the sixteenth century.30 As Anne Goldgar notes in her book deflating the myths about the tulip mania in the 1630s, the Dutch at the time viewed “the flower trade. . . as a trade in a new product, one of many new products that had been flooding the country for the previous forty and more years.”31 The pretty well-off early-modern person said to himself: “I must have some of those tulips, that sugar, that tobacco, that porcelain,” in the same way that nowadays you must have the latest cell phone or blue jeans or high speed internet hookup.
The Myth of the Rational Market: A History of Risk, Reward, and Delusion on Wall Street by Justin Fox
Instead, they hoped their number crunching could give them something more valuable—the ability to see into the future and forecast the cycles of the market. That there were cycles seemed obvious to most. Securities markets as we understand them today (continuously operating, indoor exchanges) developed in the late 1700s as European governments began selling bonds on a regular basis, mainly to finance wars. There had been famous market manias and panics before—tulip mania in 1630s Holland, and in the early 1700s the Mississippi Bubble in France and the South Sea Bubble in England. It was only in the 1800s that observers began to see a certain regularity in them. Near-clockwork regularity, it seemed. In England there were market panics in 1804–5, 1815, 1825, 1836, 1847, and 1857. A famous early explanation for these cycles came from William Stanley Jevons, the mathematical economist, who proposed in the 1870s that the waxing and waning of spots on the sun—that occurred on an eleven-year cycle—was to blame.
When Soros’s The Alchemy of Finance was first published in 1987, academics ignored or dismissed the reflexivity idea, partly because the practitioner-oriented book was written “in a different language”. Yet, it has found a large following among investors and it may have also influenced later academic work on positive-feedback trading and on bubbles. Other research also confirms that fast credit growth and financial deregulation /innovation are common characteristics of major booms that end in tears. Bubbles have a long, infamous history since the Dutch tulip mania (1637) and the South Sea and Mississippi company bubbles (both about 1720). Wall Street in 1929, Japan in 1989, and global technology stocks in 1999 are the most famous equity market bubbles of the past century. Of course, there are alternative explanations for these high equity prices but the explanations involving purely rational stories, such as time-varying risk premia, are unsatisfactory.
The sales charge is universally stated as a percentage of the selling price, which includes the charge, making it appear lower than if applied to net asset value. We consider this a sales gimmick unworthy of this respectable industry. 2. The Money Managers, by G. E. Kaplan and C. Welles, Random House, 1969. 3. See definition of “letter stock” on p. 579. 4. Title of a book first published in 1852. The volume described the “South Sea Bubble,” the tulip mania, and other speculative binges of the past. It was reprinted by Bernard M. Baruch, perhaps the only continuously successful speculator of recent times, in 1932. That was locking the stable door after the horse was stolen. Charles Mackay’s Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (Metro Books, New York, 2002) was first published in 1841. Neither a light read nor always strictly accurate, it is an extensive look at how large numbers of people often believe very silly things—for instance, that iron can be transmuted into gold, that demons most often show up on Friday evenings, and that it is possible to get rich quick in the stock market.
What Went Wrong: How the 1% Hijacked the American Middle Class . . . And What Other Countries Got Right by George R. Tyler
Continental Europe was the site of all three pivotal elements comprising modern financial economics: joint stock companies, banks conducting fractional reserve lending, and stock exchanges. Each was essentially in place around the time settlers reached Jamestown. That allowed greedy sovereigns and schemers during the Colonial era to profit on a mass scale from the opportunities offered by credit. Perhaps the most famous bubble was the 1636 Tulip Mania that caused the Dutch to wildly bid up prices—some writers suggest even so high that the value of one bulb could feed a merchant ship’s crew for one year; woe the unfortunate sailor who munched one, mistaking it for an onion.9 In the eighteenth century, the Mississippi Scheme in France and the South Sea Bubble in England caused 1720 to be a particularly bad year for deregulation—worse even than the Great Depression.
Small already—the entire nation was about the size of California, and populated with roughly half the people of the United States—their country was further crowded by the fact that little of the land was arable, and since arable land also tended to be land on which people could more easily live, the major part of the population was further concentrated into a handful of large, dense cities, where real-estate prices became more precious still. The remarkable result of these seemingly ordinary facts was that the commercial real estate in the city of Tokyo alone had a higher "book" value than that of all the land in America's forty-eight contiguous states. More remarkably still, this absurd fiction was accepted by everyone as though it made sense, when in fact it was every bit as madly artificial as the Dutch Tulip Mania of the seventeenth century. But as with America, what was a national economy, after all, but a collective belief? Or so everyone had thought for a generation. The frugal Japanese citizens saved a high proportion of their earnings. Those savings went into banks, in such vast quantities that the supply of capital for lending was similarly huge, as a result of which the interest rates for those loans were correspondingly low, which allowed businesses to purchase land and build on it despite prices that anywhere else in the world would have been somewhere between ruinous and impossible.

Martha Graham knew what she was talking about when she said that. Dancing is one of those skills that you can start at any time in your life and enjoy it any day and every day. There are many kinds of dance styles, and each has its own technique and rhythm. The salsa is a fast paced dance that originated in Latin America, and made its way to the clubs of New York. It was at its peak in the seventies. Now, salsa is back with a bang and is all the rage these days and here’s why:
Learning something new keeps you young and healthy, mentally and physically. It is always good to take on a new challenge as it gives you a goal and purpose in an otherwise dull and routine life.
Some people run, some walk, some go to the gym and some others just dance their way to good health. Almost every dance has a technique and style to it. It may seem daunting when you watch other people dance the salsa, but with a good teacher, you will master it. Salsa dancing burns calories faster than most other kinds of dances because of the quick pace.
There’s nothing more relaxing at the end of a long day than to go out and dance. The rapid step of the salsa in a nippy weather is sure to take your mind off the stress of the day, and provide loads of fun. You can let your hair down and concentrate on the steps. By the end of your salsa dance lesson, you won’t remember what you were worrying about earlier.
Salsa has a repertoire of movements, intricate and complex. A good dance instructor will take you through the different levels of salsa training, and help you master a routine before moving on to the next. Soon, you will find that your posture has improved, your walk is more graceful and your reflexes are uncannily fast.
Salsa is one of those dances that couples can attend together. A lot of salsa steps depend on the swift reflexes of both partners. You have to learn to trust your partner and work on the rhythm and technique together to perform the salsa well. Many couples who are overwhelmed with the boredom of everyday life find that their passion and attraction for each other gets re-ignited, as they learn the sexy salsa.
The salsa is a dance for which you need a partner. In a good dance class, you will find people of all ages and types, but they will all have one thing in common. They are adventurous and want to learn something new. You will meet and befriend many like-minded people.

Backstage with Venexiana at New York Fashion Week - Spring 2015 - Dreams in Heels - Travel and Lifestyle Blog by a Latina Abroad
In the spirit of keeping things international, I met backstage with the lovely Kati Stern, renowned fashion designer behind the Venexiana fashion house. She told Dreams in Heels about her fabulous new collection, “I tried to create something special and appealing for the European market as well as the US market”. This time around, her garments showcased beautifully embellished fabrics, seductive silhouettes and a sophisticated color palette, evoking romance and glamour with her designs. Born and educated in Europe, Kati Stern is not only an acclaimed fashion designer; she is also a professional architect, a classically trained pianist and a passionate flamenco dancer. “Because I am also an architect, symmetry is very much in my design, and of course, it’s summer, so I brought in some very beautiful colors.” Launched in 2003 by designer Stern, Venexiana can be found at Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus and other leading retailers around the world.

Before discussing deeply into the topic of dream and creativity, it is more proper in the beginning to interpret the meaning of dream and to understand how it is formed.
Firstly, the following is a quote extracted from a lecture at the "Exceptional Human Experiences" conference held in New York City, 1993:
"Dreams are ordinary only in the sense that everyone has them. What makes them extraordinary and qualifies them as exceptional human experience are the gifts they bring to our lives if we learn how to receive them"(1), says Montague Ullman.
As dreaming is a common experience in human everyday life, according to a lecture presented by Montague Ullman, at the same conference held in New York City, June 13, 1993, he interpreted "dream is a remembrance in an awake state of whatever it is that we can bring back from the previous night's dreaming experience."(1)
Moreover, in the early period of twentieth-century, Sigmund Freud, an Austrian psychologist and also a founder of psychoanalysis, interpreted dream "as a disguised fulfillment of unconscious wish."(2)
In Freud's theory, the dream content of the dreamer usually is suppressed wishes of the dreamer. Dreams fulfill our wishes, which are not accessible to us or have been repressed in waking life. According to Freud, "dreams as disguised fulfillment of unconscious wish"(2), the dream as it is experienced by the dreamer is not what it appears to be, rather, it is somehow distorted.
Later on, with the development of brain science, dream is defined as a sequence of sensation, images, emotions, and thoughts passing through a sleeping person's mind. "Dreaming is nothing but our occasional awareness of brain activation in sleep."(3)

I've been surfing online greater than 3 hours today, yet I by no means found any interesting article like yours. It is lovely value enough for me. In my view, if all site owners and bloggers made excellent content material as you probably did, the internet might be a lot more helpful than ever before.
"Whether or not we view ourselves as creative in our working lives, our dreaming psyche revels in its own seemingly unlimited creative potential."

Granite is a natural material that is both distinctive and durable for a beautiful kitchen. Granites may have some white in the background, but mostly they are found in colorful shades with striking flecks – reds, greens, golds, creams, rusts, blues, silvers and even blacks are colors you can find in granite. Granite has a lower porosity than some natural stones, and many types of granite do not need to be regularly sealed. Some types of granite may need to be sealed at the time of installation.Preview Granite Choices..
Quartz is a marriage of a natural mineral and modern technology. The natural mineral quartz is, by itself, not much more than a sandy powder. Bonded together with manmade polymers, it becomes a highly durable countertop selection with the sparkling beauty of a natural looking stone and the wherewithal to hold up in the kitchen. As a manmade product, it can also be produced in a variety of colors to meet the demand for the most popular looks – it is even available in options that look like granite and marble. Quartz is available in pure white and other solid colors giving projects a more monochromatic and minimalistic designed for contemporary designed homes. Quartz is non-porous, does not require sealing, and is also heat resistant, chemical resistant, and fends off etches and scratches. Preview Quartz Choices..
Marble is also a natural stone that is easily recognizable. Its characteristic veining and bold, white backdrop makes it a classic option that can achieve modern looks. Marble is most commonly known as a bright white or grey look, but it also comes in other shades like pinks, blacks, oranges and reds. Marble is a porous stone and it is known to absorb spills as well as scratch and etch. With proper care, a marble countertop will stay beautiful so don’t rule it out. Sealants and cleansers for marble have come a long way! Preview Marble Choices..
Quartzite is often confused with quartz, but it is not the same. Quartzite is a natural stone that originated as sandstone and also includes the mineral quartz, which is what gives it sparkle. In essence, quartzite is a fusion of marble and granite, creating the elegant look of marble, with the durability of granite. Like quartz countertops, quartzite doesn’t etch, but does require sealing to protect its natural beauty. Preview Quartzite Choices..
Onyx countertops are a rare option – they are striking and luxurious and often used for vertical surfaces as bold statement walls in high-end residential and commercial designs. As a flat surface in the kitchen, onyx can be a functional piece of art you get to see every day, especially with under-counter lighting, as onyx has a transparent quality like no other. Onyx generally comes in swirling and pastel color patterns, and each piece is as unusual as the last. It is most suited as an accent countertop or bar area that does not see as much traffic, though with proper care, polished and sealed, onyx performs similarly to marble. Preview Onyx Choices..
Limestone is usually found in soft beiges and tans similar to its sister stone, marble, and is a subtle and comforting option that adds warmth and a welcoming nature to a room. It is a stone softer than granite and marble, which means it should be used as countertops in lower traffic areas or in a kitchen where hard objects will not be dropped on it to avoid cracks or chips. In terms of porosity, like granite and marble, with proper sealing, it can be protected from most kitchen culprits. Preview Limestone Choices..
Soap Stone is a classic choice that is coming back into popularity for both indoor and outdoor applications, as well as for kitchen countertops. It is a durable stone that is not very absorbent, so stains do not penetrate easily. It can be sealed or oiled, and owners who enjoy ageing a stone will see it darken with a lovely patina over the years. Soap Stone is also easily refinished and restored, so it can be updated over time if desired. Preview Soap Stone Choices..
Travertine, like quartz and granite, is a durable countertop solution, and highly versatile. The creamy neutral beiges and browns of Travertine lends itself to classic Old Word style; transforming kitchens into warm, inviting spaces. It comes in both slabs and coordinating tiles that can be used for flooring and backsplashes to create a muted look. Preview Travertine Choices..
I wrote this post after I received several samples of Wild Tree spice packets from a friend. She asked if I could write a blog post, and since I love to cook (and I love pasta) I said, ‘Yes!’ All opinions of the product used are definitely 100% my own!
I want to make it no secret that although I’m not Italian, I love pasta. Stroganoff, spaghetti, fettucine, and any other pasta that you want to throw my way (unless it includes a lot of odd seafood); I will definitely eat it.
Yet pasta used to be a fear food. I used to have a great deal of fear foods. But the perfect love of God does cast out all that fear, because now there is no pasta dish that I’m really afraid of; some times I have a hard time ordering them/eating them at restaurants, but that’s still a work in progress.

Sometimes, a book comes into your life at just the right time, and this was so perfectly timed it’s untrue.
I only picked it up by a random choice when I was browsing the religion section at the library. It stuck out to me for some reason so I checked it out. And it turned out to be completely perfect for what is going on in my life right now.
Michael Mayne was a priest struck down with a seemingly mysterious illness. The doctors didn’t know what was wrong and he spent most of his days in bed, unable to summon the energy to move. Eventually, after being shunted from doctor to doctor for test after test, the doctors told him it was probably some kind of post-viral syndrome, which could clear up in days, or it could take up to a year.
This is quite similar to my dad. He’s been spending the majority of his time in bed since last August, when he suddenly lost all energy and found it extremely comfortable to sit up for any long period of time. He’s not asleep when he’s in bed, just completely lethargic – like the author. And the doctors have diagnosed ‘extreme jet lag’, one of the things that was suggested to Michael.
The first half of the book took you through Michael’s year of illness, the highs (not many) and the lows (a lot). The second half of the book is the Michael talking about how he relates this to his experience of God, and how he doesn’t lay the blame for his illness, how suffering has a higher purpose. The book was a great (and very personal) story about illness and hope, perfectly timed to give me the hope I needed.
“Nowhere is Jesus more powerful than in his passive suffering on the Cross. Nowhere does he show more clearly the truth of the passive, suffering God whose hands are tied by love.”
God knows why I didn’t do this before with the amount of books that I read, but this weekend I finally re-joined the library! I’d been a member since I was about 3 years old; so young that my library card had my mum’s signature on instead of mine! But when I was about 16, Leeds City Council introduced a Breeze card for young people and my library card was merged in with that. And since that expired when I was 19 years old, I haven’t set foot back in any of the Leeds Libraries.
But what an amazing place. Walk in, pick some books, walk out. And no cost! I expected to have to pay for a new card but the lovely lady at the desk at Pudsey library signed me back up in a jiffy. It was really hard not to walk out with an armful of books, but I managed to restrain myself to just 3. Until I journeyed to Leeds Central Library yesterday and picked another four! I don’t think I’ll ever stop reading now!
The best thing is how easy it is now to take out a book (or three). No queuing up at the desk, just set all your books on a machine, scan the barcode on your library card and the machine detects the RFID tags in each book to know what you’ve taken out and prints you a nice little receipt with the return dates on. How fabulously easy!
Plus, as confirmed on Twitter, you don’t even have to take books back to the same library you checked them out from, as long as you take them back somewhere in Leeds. So I don’t need to worry about taking books out on my lunch break in Guiseley/Yeadon or at the weekend at home in Pudsey, just take them back wherever is convenient!

The Fishley Holland story starts with George Fishley, father of Edmund and Robert Fishley and grandfather of Edwin Beer Fishley (1832-1912, who ran the Fremington Pottery in North Devon from 1865 to 1906. Edwin's grandson, William Fishley Holland worked at the pottery from 1902, and found himself unemployed when his uncles sold the works after Edwin's death.
William went to nearby Braunton and built and managed the Braunton Pottery for a gentleman by the name of Hooper. It was at Braunton that Michael Cardew learnt to throw, under the tuition of William Fishley Holland. In 1921 Hooper became insolvent and the Pottery was sold.
William moved to Clevedon in North Somerset, purchased a piece of land and opened his own pottery. Many other Fishley Hollands followed, including William (his son), Peter, Isabel and George, who added 'DUNSTER' to his signature from 1959 onwards when he moved from Clevedon to Dunster, also in Somerset.
My summer in Warsaw has been an amazing experience. Participating in this program has been exhilarating, culturally enriching and one of the most significant experiences of my undergraduate education.

Clone Being: Exploring the Psychological and Social Dimensions is the only book published to date that focuses specifically on the psychological and social implications of cloning.
Cloning pioneer, Ian Wilmut, wrote in The Times of London Higher Education Supplement, that the book provides "the first framework for detailed analysis of the ethical, psychological, and social consequences of human reproductive cloning."
In The Lancet, Dan Bustillos, found the book to be a "welcome refrain to the cloning debate cacophony, and an argument that policymakers ignore at the peril of future generations."
Attesting to the relevance of the book to human issues beyond cloning, L. Brancaccio Taras, in Choice, wrote: "Although human clones do not exist as yet, this well-written, thought-provoking book also covers current issues, such as ethics and sexuality, which are applicable to the psychological development of all humans."
The book's analogical method elucidates a range of likely psychological and social consequences of human reproductive cloning by drawing parallels to the issues faced by step, adopted, and namesaked individuals, the impact of a parent's wish for a self-resembling child, and the complexities faced by offspring of famous people.
Deriving from the book is my chapter opposing human reproductive cloning, included in the textbook, Contemporary Debates in Bioethics (2013), edited by Caplan and Arp.

Fruitastic Creations is here to change the way you eat writing custom your fruit. We wanted to bring something fresh, vibrant and unique to Glasgow. It started with the thought of creating an alternative to flower bouquets. With a lot of research, experimenting, practising, mentoring and a lot of fruit (which we enjoyed eating…waste not want not ); we created, for you, our unique edible alternative to flower gifts.
Our Fruitastic Creations are suitable for all events. Celebrating the birth of a new baby, a ‘Get Well’ soon and many more important occasions.
Our succulent strawberries are of the highest quality. That’s what makes us Fruitastic: Quality. With a wide choice of colours and flavours, using a range of quality chocolates. Designed and presented in a flower like bouquet, will make anyone feel special.
Our indulging edible bouquets come in various sizes to suit all budgets and occasions with no compromise on quality.
Our platters and fruit carvings use everyday fruits to transform them enticingly into flowers and swans, from vases to bowls and much more. Be part of the fruit revolution, join us in eating more.
It is our belief to provide healthy high quality products. We know what ingredients we use to create our bouquets. Many, if not all foods readily available, contain some type of food additives and colourings. This is where we are cautious! Many additives and colours contain animal or insect based ingredients, which in our opinion render the confectionery unsuitable for vegetarians. We will always use an alternative vegetarian source for such ingredients.
Additives are usually hidden by labelling them as custom written papers E numbers, leaving consumers unaware and without a clue as to what they are eating. Take for example the red food colouring, made from crushed insects labelled as E120 used in anything from chewy sweets to chocolate to give a red dye. For those with alternative dietary needs you will find alcohol and alcohol-based derivatives are used to flavour confectionery. We take it upon ourselves to check each ingredient thoroughly before we add it to our creations and therefore you can rest assured that our products are suitable for vegetarians and if there is any animal based ingredient present then it will be clearly labelled.
You’re sure to find something for that special someone or occasion. We deliver in Glasgow and surrounding areas please check our delivery page.

This CSS id dependent on what your thumbnails are set in the wp-admin -> settings -> media, adjust the widths and heights accordingly
Hate to be a bother, but I updated this morning and my right sidebar is now displaying below the body, like the body (or possibly the sidebar) is too wide by a few pixels. Any suggestions?
Nevermind, I got it. It was the body.layout-2clw #content-column. Dropped its width by 10px and it worked like a charm.
Hey Frumph! I’ve spent several couple hours trying to fix this very problem, and without the forums around, this is the only place I can find that addresses it. Can you help? The site is:
I just want the two side columns to appear on the outside of the comic (which only works if the comic is thin, but I want it to be 700 wide), and the closest I’ve come to maybe coming near to solving it is changing:
In the past I’ve been able to figure out comicpress with other sites I’ve worked on, I’m not sure why I’m having trouble with easel.
Just so I don’t make the same mistake as I did last week, what is the best way to update to 4.0.4? Can I just update automatically via my wordpress dashboard or do I have to delete the folder via ftp and install the update manually (as it used to be done in previous comicpress versions)?
My comic archive looks fine, but I’m only getting thumbnails for the first page of each chapter and they’re not clickable to that page… do you have any plans into setting it up how Comic Press was in version 2.9.x where the archive was brokendown into chapter pages and within those there were thumbnails of the comic pages? I always liked that format.
sorry am kinda new to comic press, is there away to have more then one comic, using comicpress in 4.0.??
I’m a bit new to comicpress as well, still using 2.9.4 – mostly using a child theme, do you think I’d lose much updating to 4.0.5?
So I recently updated everything, wordpress, themes and plugins and now my strip isn’t displaying, what did I break?
Y’know, I had kinda ruled out wordpress for webcomic needs as much as I like the CMS, but this actually kinda changed my mind- the amount of support around, that is, not just necessarily this post. I’ve been trying to figure out some solutions for multi-comic stuff too, and I think I’ve found the hints I need to get started here. So thanks!
Statewide poll by advocacy group shows support for charter schools in Florida | Florida School Boards Association
A new statewide poll commissioned by the Florida Charter School Alliance finds significant support for charter schools — including support for a statewide authorizer, one of the alliance’s top legislative priorities this year that school districts fear would take away local authority over public education.
The Herald/Times was given a copy of the poll results ahead of their official release, expected later this evening.
The alliance spent nearly $11,000 for National Victory Strategies to conduct the poll not knowing what the results would be, saidRalph Arza, a lobbyist for the alliance and a former Republican state lawmaker from Miami.

Wembley Stadium will not be sold after Fulham and Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan withdrew his offer to buy the venue.
The Football Association (FA) was in the process of considering a £600million bid for England's national stadium, with their council members set to vote on the proposal.
"Earlier this year, the FA received an unsolicited official offer from Shahid Khan to buy Wembley Stadium," FA chief executive Martin Glenn said in a statement.
"Shahid Khan has informed us that he will be withdrawing his offer to buy the stadium - and we fully respect his decision.
"Mr Khan believed that his offer to buy Wembley Stadium would release funds to help improve community football facilities in England and that it would be well received by all football stakeholders.
"At a recent meeting with Mr Khan he expressed to us that, without stronger support from within the game, his offer is being seen as more divisive than it was anticipated to be and has decided to withdraw his proposal.
"Wembley Stadium is an iconic venue that is revered around the world and it will continue to thrive under the ownership and direction of the FA.
"There has been much deliberation on both sides of this debate and it has undoubtedly raised awareness of the issue that community football facilities in England need significant investment.
"We would like to thank the football stakeholders, Government, FA Board and Council members for their collaborative approach throughout this process. We will continue to work together to identify new and innovative ways of investing in community football facilities in the future."
In his own statement, Khan suggested the latest development was not necessarily the end of the matter.
"I cannot rule out revisiting the opportunity at another time when perhaps the Football Association family is unified in its views on the opportunity," he said.
The Jaguars have been playing annual games at Wembley since 2013 and Khan stressed that he remains committed to both their London arrangement and redeveloping the area around TIAA Bank Field in Jacksonville.
"While this is a disappointing development, we will continue to emphasise London and the role the UK plays in ensuring a promising long-term future for the Jaguars in downtown Jacksonville," he added.
"London as the Jaguars' home away from home remains a priority. Downtown Jacksonville with the Jaguars serving as a catalyst in its revitalisation remains a priority."

Metal phosphides happen to be utilised as a means of killing rodents and are considered single-dose quick performing rodenticides (death occurs usually inside one–three times soon after one bait ingestion). A bait consisting of foods and a phosphide (commonly zinc phosphide) is remaining where by the rodents can take in it. The acid within the digestive system on the rodent reacts While using the phosphide to produce the toxic phosphine gas. This process of vermin control has achievable use in areas exactly where rodents are immune to a number of the anticoagulants, particularly for control of house and discipline mice; zinc phosphide baits will also be more affordable than most next-technology anticoagulants, to ensure that often, in the situation of huge infestation by rodents, their populace is initially minimized by copious amounts of zinc phosphide bait applied, and the rest of inhabitants that survived the Original fast-performing poison is then eradicated by prolonged feeding on anticoagulant bait.

ABSTRACT. Farmer insurance contributions are lower than non-agricultural insurance contributions. Old-age pensions and pensions for farmers are lower than old-age pensions and pensions from non-agricultural social insurance system. Social benefits significantly influence the financial situation of farming families. The role of social benefits in the average farming family budget increases. Under conditions of European integration Poland is not obliged to introduce new insurance system, neither new social benefits nor to change the rules of calculating the amount of benefits. KRUS has become the institution co-operating with the relevant institutions from countries of European Union. This article includes also description of farmer’s insurance in Poland called KRUS and its influence on income situations of polish farmers. It was made by using descriptive analysis. Organization structure, tasks and KRUS’ rules of action as well as pension and retirement importance in income was described. This analysis shows also polish insurance system in comparison with another EU’s countries. Polish farmers are covered by farmer's insurance system, which is serviced by an institution established solely for that purpose, that being the Agricultural Insurance Fund (KRUS).

I've been slowly getting my painting mojo back, and decided to get out my wet-palette and the matt-medium to have a go with thinner paints and intermediate tones.

Recycling water from municipal wastewater offers a reliable and sustainable solution to cities and regions facing shortage of water supply. Places including California and Singapore have developed advanced water reuse programs as an integral part of their water management strategy. Membrane technology, particularly reverse osmosis, has been playing a key role in producing high quality recycled water. This feature paper highlights the current status and future perspectives of advanced membrane processes to meet potable water reuse. Recent advances in membrane materials and process configurations are presented and opportunities and challenges are identified in the context of water reuse.
Potable water reuse has become an important indispensable component of the water infrastructure in many cities and regions around the world to address water scarcity. Membrane technology, particularly reverse osmosis (RO), has played a key role in producing highly purified recycled water. Compared to alternative technologies such as activated carbon adsorption and soil aquifer treatment, RO provides better assurance for safe potable applications thanks to its ability to simultaneously remove a broad range of contaminants including total dissolved solids, pathogens (viruses and bacteria) and low molecular chemical contaminants.
As a notable example, water supply of Southern California traditionally relied heavily (about two-thirds) on imported water, whose availability has shrunk significantly over the last four decades due to more upstream demand, stringent environmental regulations and multiyear droughts. Severe overdraft of groundwater since 1940s has caused declining groundwater levels and seawater intrusion that contaminated freshwater aquifers. In the 1970s, Orange County Water District in Southern California started its Water Factory 21 (WF21), which employed RO-based advanced treatment processes to produce high quality recycled water for direct injection to the drinking water aquifers. Since 2008, a new Groundwater Replenishment System (GWRS) has replaced WF21 to produce 70 million gallons per day (MGD) of highly purified water using RO technology. This world’s largest advanced wastewater reclamation system for potable reuse has expanded its production to 100 MGD in 2015, with an ultimate capacity of 130 MGD to be completed by 2023.
Advancement in membrane technology in recent years has increased the number of water reuse projects worldwide. In California alone, several additional major projects have been implemented or planned ( Figure 1a), including the 40-MGD Edward C. Little Water Recycling Facility, a potential 150-MGD Regional Recycled Water Program in Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, and a scheduled Groundwater Reliability Improvement Project (GRIP) to produce recycled water in 2018. Water reuse has gone far beyond any single region or country, stretching from the United States, Singapore in the Far East, South and Western Europe to Australia in the southern hemisphere. In Singapore, the five NEWater plants provide a total of 170 MGD, or 40% of the nation’s water supply. This number is scheduled to be increased to 55% by 2060. Australia commissioned the 20 MGD Beenyup plant, the first RO plant in Australia for indirect potable reuse, in 2016. In parallel to the development of large scale reuse activities, plants of smaller sizes are also spreading all over the world (e.g., Belgium, South Africa, Namibia, the United Kingdom, and the United States).
Figure 1. Developments of membrane-based wastewater reuse. (a) Historical development. The lower part of the figure shows notable examples of wastewater reuse plants together with their treatment schemes. The size of the sphere represents the relative size of a plant. The upper part of the figure presents the development of new desalting membranes. CA, TFC, and TFN membranes have already been commercialized, whereas most reported CNT, graphene, MOF, and MoS2 membranes are synthesized at bench or miniature scales. The respective years of first appearance of aquaporin, graphene, MOF and MoS2 membranes are based on the year of publication (refs ). The images of the membranes in the upper part of the figure are reprinted with copyright permissions: CA and TFC membranes from ref , CNT membrane from ref , biomimetic membrane from ref , TFN membrane from ref , graphene membrane from ref , MOF membrane from ref , and MoS2 membrane from ref . (b) Evolution of membrane-based water reuse: (i) conventional pretreatment of secondary effluent followed by RO; (ii) MF pretreatment of secondary effluent followed by RO, where an additional UV/H2O2 post-treatment may be used for the further removal of organic micropollutants; (iii) MBR-RO treatment, where an additional UV/H2O2 post-treatment may be used for the further removal of organic micropollutants; and (iv) OMBR with an optional draw solution reconcentration unit.
With water scarcity becoming an increasingly serious threat globally, the thirst for water reuse is growing. This feature paper examines the evolution of membrane-based water reuse technology and highlights future opportunities and challenges in this field.
Reverse osmosis (RO) is a well-established technology that can be used in combination with other complementary processes (for pretreatment to remove particulate matter and posttreatment to ensure the destruction of any remaining micropollutants) to produce high quality recycled water ( Figure 1a,b). WF21 in Southern California introduced the first RO plant in the world in 1977 to purify reclaimed water to meet drinking water standards. This 5 MGD RO plant was used to reduce the total dissolved solids of secondary effluent after pretreatment by conventional lime clarification, recarbonation, and multimedia filtration ( Figure 1b(i)). In modern potable reuse plants, conventional pretreatment is often replaced by a single microfiltration (MF) process ( Figure 1b(ii)), which is more compact and efficient for the removal of particulates. In addition, downstream low pressure-high intensity ultraviolet light with hydrogen peroxide (UV/H 2O 2) is typically used to ensure adequate destruction of small molecular weight micropollu-tants such as N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) that cannot be completely removed by RO membranes. This advanced MF-RO-UV/H 2O 2 treatment scheme has been widely adopted in numerous potable reuse plants. A further significant improvement is the direct treatment of membrane bioreactor (MBR) effluent by RO ( Figure 1b(iii)). In this new treatment scheme, the MBR achieves simultaneous roles of bioreactor, biomass separation, and RO pretreatment. The elimination of further RO pretreatment using the particulate-free MBR effluent translates into additional savings of space, energy, and cost, which prompts Changi NEWater Plant in Singapore to adopt the MBR-RO-UV/H 2O 2 scheme.
Despite these significant improvements over the last few decades, water reuse is still facing many challenges. A report on water reuse issued by the U.S. National Academies in 2012 highlighted the critical need to provide quality assurance with respect to pathogens and micropollutants. Issues of high energy consumption, membrane fouling, and concentrate disposal (particularly for inland RO water recycling plants) need to be further addressed through process innovation and novel membrane development ( Table 1).

micropollutants removal novel membranes tailored for micropollutants removal novel process design (e.g., osmotic membrane bioreactor)
Alternative membrane processes such as forward osmosis (FO) have been explored for water reuse in recent years. FO itself is a low-energy process, since water transports through a dense semipermeable membrane spontaneously using a high osmotic pressure draw solution instead of hydraulic pressure. One key challenge for FO is the energy-intensive reconcentration of draw solution for clean water production. Applications that do not require draw solution reconcentration, such as osmotic dilution of seawater or brine with wastewater, are also gaining more attention. An osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) patented in 2005 is another innovative technique for the reclamation of wastewater, which combines activated sludge treatment and forward osmosis in a single unit process ( Figure 1b(iv)). Compared to the MBR-RO scheme ( Figure 1b(iii)), OMBR can be potentially more compact and less energy intensive for niche applications where draw solutions do not need to be reconcentrated. Other potential for osmotic membrane bioreactors include the high rejection of micropollutants and the simultaneous recovery of water, minerals, and nutrients. Recent extension to anaerobic OMBRs further allow the recovery of energy in the form of biomethane. Future studies shall further address the challenges of membrane fouling, salinity accumulation in the bioreactor, and membrane stability in order to enable its full scale applications. Development of membrane-based hybrid processes also has the potential to address the issue of brine disposal (e.g., the hybridization of RO, FO, and/or membrane distillation with a crystallizer).
The state-of-the-art thin film composite (TFC) polyamide membranes are prepared by the interfacial polymerization reaction of amine monomers (typically m-phenylenediamine or MPD) and trimesoyl chloride (TMC). Commercial TFC polyamide membranes have a wide range of pH tolerance (pH 2–11), excellent mechanical stability (up to several MPa of applied pressure), high salt rejection (e.g., NaCl rejection of up to 99.8%) and yet a moderate water permeability (e.g., 1–8 L/m 2-h-bar)). Unlike seawater desalination whose energy consumption (∼4 kWh/m 3) is mainly dictated by the high osmotic pressure of seawater (∼ 2.7 MPa), the energy consumption in RO-based water reuse (∼ 1 kWh/m 3 with approximately 0.555 kWh/m 3 for RO) is governed mostly by membrane resistance and fouling. Tripling membrane water permeability can potentially reduce the energy consumption for potable reuse by half. Thus, developing low-pressure RO membranes with high permeability and good antifouling performance deserves to be a top research priority.
A new type of RO membranes, known as thin film nanocomposite (TFN) membranes, were developed by Hoek and co-workers in 2007. In this novel approach, zeolite nanoparticles of defined pore size are included into the polyamide rejection layer during an interfacial polymerization ( Figure Neosens Lining Bottle Ankle Cynthia nbsp;leather Classic Boots nXPvnFa). The inclusion of porous zeolite nanoparticles enhances the resulting membrane permeability while maintaining its salt rejection. The ease of fabricating TFN membranes at relatively cheap cost allows its commercial scale up. In the meantime, many other materials, such as nanoparticles of silver, silica, or zinc oxide, have been extensively studied for the synthesis of TFN membranes, although the majority of the studies were performed at bench scale.
Another effective way to increase the membrane permeability is by reducing the thickness of the polyamide rejection layer. Gu and co-workers introduced a molecular layer-by-layer (mLBL) membrane. In their approach, an ultrathin polyamide rejection layer was prepared by alternative soaking of a substrate in low-concentration MPD and TMC solutions for repeated cycles ( Figure Neosens Lining Bottle Ankle Cynthia nbsp;leather Classic Boots nXPvnFb). A mLBL membrane of 20–25 nm in thickness was prepared, which show 75% improvement in water permeability and similar NaCl rejection compared to a control TFC membrane prepared by conventional interfacial polymerization with rejection layer thickness of 110 nm. Livingston and co-workers prepared an ultrathin polyamide membrane by performing interfacial polymerization reaction on a sacrificial layer of nanostrands. The presence of the nanostrand layer significantly reduced the diffusion of MPD monomers, which resulted in an ultrathin and smooth polyamide rejection layer of less than 10 nm in thickness ( Figure Neosens Lining Bottle Ankle Cynthia nbsp;leather Classic Boots nXPvnFc). Though the resultant membrane showed excellent permeability of more than two orders of magnitude higher than a commercial benchmark and similar selectivity, this method is unfortunately difficult to scale up. By electrospraying MPD and TMC monomer solutions into microdroplets for subsequent interfacial polymerization, Tang and co-workers demonstrated finely controlled growth of a polyamide rejection film at 1 nm/min. This electrospray-assisted additive interfacial polymerization approach, a method that can be more easily scaled up, was able to prepare uniform ultrathin polyamide membranes of four to a few tens of nm in thickness.
Researchers are also paying increasing attention to the nanostructures of the polyamide rejection layer. A recent work demonstrated the feasibility to simultaneously increase the permeability and rejection of a TFC polyamide membrane by promoting the formation of nanosized gas bubbles to tune the membrane surface roughness. This nanofoaming strategy can be easily realized by adding nanobubble precursors to the monomers solutions, for example, dosing NaHCO 3 into the MPD solution. Zhang and coworkers developed another simple method to tune the membrane surface roughness using additives such as poly(vinyl alcohol) and demonstrated an order of magnitude improvement in membrane water permeability. Several other researchers also show the possibility of order of magnitude improvement in permeability by including an interfacial layer (e.g., tannic acid–Fe complex, polydopamine or CNTs) between the polyamide and its polysulfone support.
In recent years, novel materials have emerged as potential candidates for preparation of high performance RO membranes. One type of promising material is aquaporins ( Figure Neosens Lining Bottle Ankle Cynthia nbsp;leather Classic Boots nXPvnFd), or water channel proteins, that are found in cellular membranes for delivering water across biological cells with permeabilities of 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than the best commercially available RO membranes and with nearly complete rejection of solutes including H +. Synthetic channels and porous materials have also been investigated for their use in synthesizing ultrapermeable membranes; some of the most notable examples include self-assembled artificial water channels, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), microporous metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), graphene, graphene oxide, and MoS 2 ( Figure Neosens Lining Bottle Ankle Cynthia nbsp;leather Classic Boots nXPvnFe–j). Their intrinsic ultrafast water transport rates can potentially half the energy consumption for water reuse. Nevertheless, a recent review highlights the challenges of defects prevention (for achieving high rejection) and scaling up (for commercial scale production). Indeed, most of the reported membranes prepared by these novel desalting materials have NaCl rejections of only ∼ or <90%, which are significantly below commercial benchmarks. A compromised approach is to incorporate these materials in a thin film nanocomposite structure, which can effectively maintain salt rejection at the expense of water permeability. For the case of aquaporins, their proteinaceous nature also makes them unstable to directly withstand the harsh wastewater environment. In contrast, the thin film nanocomposite approach provides a much better protection to the aquaporins.
Developing membranes that are resistant to fouling, particularly biofouling, is a priority research area in the context of membrane-based water reuse. Various strategies have been developed to enhance antifouling performance of membranes, which often involves surface coating, grafting, and immobilization of antiadhesion and/or biocidal agents. These approaches are generally designed to modify a membrane’s hydrophilicity, surface charge, and/or roughness, or to impart antimicrobial moieties. Some notable examples of antifouling enhancement include the preparation of antiadhesion surfaces using poly(vinyl alcohol) grafting, polydopamine coating, and zwitterionic grafting and the immobilization of antibacterial silver/copper nanoparticles.
The presence of micropollutants in wastewater is a significant issue for membrane-based water reuse. NDMA is a notorious disinfectant byproduct and a human carcinogen that is frequently detected in RO permeate. California has set a Public Health Goal of 3 ng/L and a notification level of 10 ng/L for this suspected carcinogen. NDMA rejection by RO membranes is in the range from 20 to 80%. Post-treatment by advanced oxidation processes, such as UV treatment, is effective in destructing NDMA. Nevertheless, it generally requires a very high UV intensity (e.g., 1000 mJ/cm 2), a dosage of an order of magnitude higher than that used for UV disinfection. Besides NDMA, other micropollutants of concern include endocrine disruptors and pharmaceutically active compounds.
Due to their historical roots in desalination, commercial thin film composite polyamide RO membranes have been highly optimized for salt rejection and water permeability, yet they are often not adequate for the removal of micropollutants, particularly small polar or hydrophobic organic compounds. In recent years, researchers have started to realize the need for designing membranes specifically for micropollutants removal. Tailoring membrane surface properties by surface coating/grafting show some promising results. For instance, a hydrophilic polydopamine coating can effectively half the passage of hydrophobic EDCs through a polyamide membrane. To reduce the adverse effect on water permeability, materials of high selectivity against micropollutants are needed. In this regard, some of the novel desalting materials such as aquaporins and MOFs are of great interest due to their highly defined pore structure and high specificity for water. Recent studies on aquaporin-embedded polyamide membranes showed improved rejection rates to a wide range of micropollutants. Graphene oxide sheets that are capable of forming highly hydrophilic water channels have also demonstrated great potential for micropollutants removal.
An important advantage of RO is the high removal of viruses and bacteria (disinfection), of which viruses are most important because of their smaller size, typically 20–300 nm. High pressure RO will remove viruses due to steric hindrance, since viruses are much larger than membrane pores. Despite of this, RO systems can fail due to broken seals, damaged glue lines and oxidized membranes (related to chemical cleaning), undesired back pressure damage from permeate side, abrasion by particles in the feed, etc.
Given the central role of RO in potable water reuse, several highly sensitive sensors have been developed to monitor chemical and microbial contaminants on a real-time or near real-time basis for membrane integrity assurance. In addition to traditional surrogate parameters such as conductivity, total organic carbon, and sulfate which can be readily monitored online, several new surrogates specific to potable water reuse have been added in recent years. They include UV254 or fluorescence for monitoring organic micropollutants and multiable light scattering or measurement of adenosine triphosphate for monitoring microbial contaminants. Nevertheless, currently there are no techniques to directly determine RO integrity for more than 2 log virus removal. Therefore, in the context of membrane integrity against virus removal, there is a strong need for novel methods containing: (i) high log removal values (≥4 log removal), (ii) surrogate/indicator virus with same size as natural virus size, (iii) inexpensive and fast method, (iv) real time and online monitoring, and (v) meeting the criteria for drinking water application.
Online monitoring of micropollutants can be another fruitful opportunity. Of a particular note, Fujioka et al., have successfully developed an analytical technique consisting of high-performance liquid chromatography followed by photochemical reaction and chemiluminescence detection (HPLC PR-CL) for online monitoring of NDMA and several other N-nitrosamines in secondary treated effluent and RO permeate. The detection limit of their technique (0.3–2.7 ng/L) is comparable to the regulated concentrations of these organic micropollutants in most potable water reuse guidelines or standards. The HPLC PR-CL developed by Fujioka et al., marks a significant milestone as this is the first time target organic micropollutants can be monitored in near real-time.
Figure 3 compares the different technologies based on three individual dimensions: the current scale of development (horizontal axis), the ease of scale up (vertical axis), and the potential impact to water reuse (size of the symbol). Three important quadrants are shown in the figure. The upper right quadrant represents technologies that are already commercialized or near to commercialization, whereas the lower left quadrant represents technologies that are far away from commercialization. Sweet spots exist in the upper left quadrant: even though the relevant technologies are still at the bench-scale development, it is relatively easy to scale up them. For example, high performance nanostructured polyamide membranes can be potentially produced with only minor changes to the existing fabrication lines of TFC RO membranes (e.g., with addition of NaHCO 3 or poly(vinyl alcohol) in the amine monomer solution). At the same time, the resulting improvements in membrane water permeability and selectivity can dramatically reduce the energy consumption and improve the product water quality. Other areas of paramount significance to water reuse include integrity monitoring and membranes for enhanced micropollutant removal, which deserves greater attention in future development.
Figure 3. Outlook of water reuse technologies. The horizontal axis classifies different technologies into full (commercial) scale, pilot scale, bench scale, and miniature scale. The vertical axis classifies the technologies based on their potential for scale up, with considerations based on technical difficulties as well as potential cost of production (see references). The size of the sphere represents the potential impact of a particular technology. A larger sphere indicates a great potential to improve water reuse (e.g., enhanced reliability, reduced cost, and energy consumption, and/or improved water quality).
The challenge of implementing water reuse is not confined solely to the technical domain. Public acceptance is a complex and thorny issue, one that has derailed a number of water reuse projects in the past. A particular high profile case is that of Toowoomba in Australia, where intense debate about a proposed indirect potable reuse scheme led to a referendum. As the result of the referendum, in which 60% of the participants opposed the scheme, it was abandoned. Toowoomba has been seen as the trigger point for the Queensland government in Australia to abandon the Western Corridor Recycled Water project, which was completed in 2009 but has never been used as intended. The fallout from Toowoomba underscores the need to fully understand the connection between public perception about water reuse and technological innovation.
Since Toowoomba, significant efforts often by collaborations between social scientists and engineers, and practitioners in the water sector have been made to positively influence public perception about water reuse. Providing information about the treatment processes significantly increased public acceptance of water reuse. Experiential activities such as field visits, tasting opportunities, using reused water for public swimming pools, and water splash pads can also be helpful. These efforts have resulted in better awareness by the public about the reliability and efficiency of membrane separation and other technologies used for water reclamation, and hence, a gradual shift in public acceptance and a growing number of successful water reuse schemes in recent years. As a notable example, strong public support to water reuse in Singapore can be attributed, at least in part, to a very concerted and systematic public engagement program that includes the attractive NEWater Visitor Centre at the Bedok plant. The center has effectively become a tourist attraction, where the public can book a tour for free to learn about how Singapore copes with their water supply problem and be given a bottle of NEWater (reused water) as souvenir or for tasting. Efforts to garner public support to potable reuse has evolved beyond simple marketing activities. Harris-Lovett et al. argued that establishing legitimacy for potable water reuse involves embedding RO, advanced oxidation, and other new technologies in the shared social belief system, moral standards, and cultural conventions through a set of strategies that go beyond traditional public relations and educational outreach.
A key component of the legitimacy framework proposed by Herris-Lovett et al. is reliable risk management procedures. A promising strategy is to make key innovations in potable water reuse namely membrane separation and other advanced technologies more understandable by relating to standards and procedures that have already gained legitimacy in other established sectors. Online monitoring is essential not only for establishing a safety record but also effective risk management. Indeed, while acknowledging the central role of technology innovation, Lee and Tan accredited Singapore’s success in supplying NEWater for potable use to an extensive data acquisition program to demonstrate the safety record of potable water reuse. Prior to the NEWater, the Singapore Public Utilities Board collected some 20 000 test results from different sampling locations in a demonstration plant, covering about 190 physical, chemical and microbiological parameters. The results were benchmarked against the World Health Organization and United States Environmental Protection Agency drinking water standards to demonstrate the credibility of potable water reuse.
With a focus on public safety, real-time monitoring has been a crucial strategy for assurance and risk management of potable water reuse. Real-time monitoring offers an opportunity to engage with the public as well as quickly detect and rectify failure. Aside from routine monitoring of membrane separation performance through conductivity and total organic carbon, advanced real time monitoring methods for viruses and micropollutants can be highly valuable. Further development in online monitoring of RO performance along with other improvements in membranes and processes can be expected and will help to bridge the gap between technology innovation and public confidence in potable water reuse.

A review. The growing scarcity of potable water supplies is among the most important issues facing many cities, in particular those using single sources of water that are climate dependent. Consequently, urban centers are looking to alternative sources of water supply that can supplement variable rainfall and meet the demands of population growth. A diversified portfolio of water sources is required to ensure public health, as well as social, economical and environmental sustainability. One of the options considered is the augmentation of drinking water supplies with advanced treated recycled water. This paper aims to provide a state of the art review of water recycling for drinking purposes with emphasis on membrane treatment processes. An overview of significant indirect potable reuse projects is presented followed by a description of the epidemiol. and toxicol. studies evaluating any potential human health impacts. Finally, a summary of key operational measures to protect human health and the areas that require further research are discussed.
Recycling water is an important aspect of water resource and environment management policies, ensuring reliable alternative water resources, reducing environmental pollution and achieving a more sustainable form of development. Focus is made on wastewater reuse as a strategy for integrated water management. Key economic, financial, regulatory, social and tech. factors that help to make water reuse projects successful are reviewed. Selected examples from Northern and Western Europe and arid and semi-arid Mediterranean regions illustrate the contribution of wastewater reuse to integrated management of water resources.

At the Torreele facility the Intermunicipal Water Company of Veurne-Ambacht (IWVA) treats secondary wastewater effluent for indirect potable re-use via groundwater recharge in the dune water catchment of St. Andre. The treatment combining ultrafiltration (UF), using the submerged ZeeWeed system, and reverse osmosis (RO), using brackish water low-energy membranes, enables to produce a high-quality infiltration water, and this leads to sustainable groundwater management of the dune water catchment of St. Andre. Since start-up, in July 2002, different measures have been taken to optimize the membrane performance. Intermittent use of air on the UF system and variable recovery on the RO system reduced energy consumption per m3 produced. The latter also resulted in lower chem. consumption as did the pauses in chloramination. The backwash water and RO conc. are discharged into a brackish canal, together with the effluent that is not reused. Since 2003, IWVA performed tests using natural systems to further treat this water.
Highly permeable polymeric membranes based on the incorporation of the functional water channel protein Aquaporin Z
The permeability and solute transport characteristics of amphiphilic triblock-polymer vesicles contg. the bacterial water-channel protein Aquaporin Z (AqpZ) were investigated. The vesicles were made of a block copolymer with sym. poly-(2-methyloxazoline)-poly-(dimethylsiloxane)-poly-(2-methyloxazoline) (PMOXA15-PDMS110-PMOX15) repeat units. Light-scattering measurements on pure polymer vesicles subject to an outwardly directed salt gradient in a stopped-flow app. indicated that the polymer vesicles were highly impermeable. However, a large enhancement in water productivity (permeability per unit driving force) of up to ≈800 times that of pure polymer was obsd. when AqpZ was incorporated. The activation energy (Ea) of water transport for the protein-polymer vesicles (3.4 kcal/mol) corresponded to that reported for water-channel-mediated water transport in lipid membranes. The solute reflection coeffs. of glucose, glycerol, salt, and urea were also calcd., and indicated that these solutes are completely rejected. The productivity of AqpZ-incorporated polymer membranes was at least an order of magnitude larger than values for existing salt-rejecting polymeric membranes. The approach followed here may lead to more productive and sustainable water treatment membranes, whereas the variable levels of permeability obtained with different concns. of AqpZ may provide a key property for drug delivery applications.
A review with 144 refs. Due to their exceptional mech., conductive and antibacterial properties carbon-based nanomaterials (CNMs) have been widely used in attempts to fabricate novel membranes for water treatment and desalination with advanced characteristics. This paper reviews the current state of the application of CNMs, including carbon nanotubes, graphene, graphene oxide, carbon nanofibers, MXene, carbide derived carbon and fullerene for membrane prepn. A brief description of different CNMs and their properties has been provided with ref. to membrane requirements. Thereafter the recent studies on the membrane fabrication/modification with CNMs as well as the properties of the developed membranes have been critically summarised. It was shown that, in some cases, using CNMs results in novel membranes with high flux, high rejection, low-fouling, and enhanced conductive, thermal and mech. properties. However, further research including detg. the optimum CNM quantity and characteristics, feed-specific membrane performance and long-term operability should be conducted to better evaluate the feasibility of CNM-based membranes in water treatment and desalination. This review paper is potentially important for researchers involved in the membrane fabrication using CNMs.
A review. Metal-org. framework (MOF) materials, which are constructed from metal ions or metal ion clusters and bridging org. linkers, exhibit regular cryst. lattices with relatively well-defined pore structures and interesting properties. As a new class of porous solid materials, MOFs are attractive for a variety of industrial applications including sepn. membranes - a rapidly developing research area. Many reports have discussed the synthesis and applications of MOFs and MOF thin films, but relatively few have addressed MOF membranes. This article provides an overview of the diverse MOF membranes that were prepd., beginning with a brief introduction to the current techniques for the fabrication of MOF membranes. Gas and liq. sepn. applications with different MOF membranes are also included.
Novel phys. phenomena can emerge in low-dimensional nanomaterials. Bulk MoS2, a prototypical metal dichalcogenide, is an indirect bandgap semiconductor with negligible photoluminescence. When the MoS2 crystal is thinned to monolayer, however, a strong photoluminescence emerges, indicating an indirect to direct bandgap transition in this d-electron system. Quantum confinement in layered d-electron materials like MoS2 provides new opportunities for engineering the electronic structure of matter at the nanoscale.
A review. The idea to generate power through osmosis between river and ocean water has been known since the 1970s. The potential power that can be produced worldwide through osmotic power is estd. to be 1600 TWh/a. But due to inefficient membranes, little effort has been put into research for this type of renewable ocean energy. In 2001, Statkraft, one of the major energy providers in Norway, invited GKSS-Forschungszentrum to develop a suitable osmosis membrane for pressure-retarded osmosis (PRO). Two different types of membranes were optimized: thin-film composites (TFC) and asym. cellulose acetate. To make PRO profitable, the power d. of the membrane was detd. to be between 4-6 W/m2. Starting with power prodn. from 0.1 W/m2 for the TFC membrane, a power d. of 3.5 W/m2 with a potential of 5 W/m2 was measured. The starting value for the CA-type was approx. 0.5 W/m2, and the best measured performance was 1.3 W/m2. However, if it is possible to improve PRO membranes further, PRO will move to the idea of a profitable application, generating green, emission-free energy.
An array of aligned carbon nanotubes (CNTs) was incorporated across a polymer film to form a well-ordered nanoporous membrane structure. This membrane structure was confirmed by electron microscopy, anisotropic elec. cond., gas flow, and ionic transport studies. The measured nitrogen permeance was consistent with the flux calcd. by Knudsen diffusion through nanometer-scale tubes of the obsd. microstructure. Data on Ru(NH3)63+ transport across the membrane in aq. soln. also indicated transport through aligned CNT cores of the obsd. microstructure. The lengths of the nanotubes within the polymer film were reduced by selective electrochem. oxidn., allowing for tunable pore lengths. Oxidative trimming processes resulted in carboxylate end groups that were readily functionalized at the entrance to each CNT inner core. Membranes with CNT tips that were functionalized with biotin showed a redn. in Ru(NH3)63+ flux by a factor of 15 when bound with streptavidin, thereby demonstrating the ability to gate mol. transport through CNT cores for potential applications in chem. sepns. and sensing.
Membrane-based sepns. for water purifn. and desalination have been increasingly applied to address the global challenges of water scarcity and the pollution of aquatic environments. However, progress in water purifn. membranes has been constrained by the inherent limitations of conventional membrane materials. Recent advances in methods for controlling the structure and chem. functionality in polymer films can potentially lead to new classes of membranes for water purifn. In this Review, we first discuss the state of the art of existing membrane technologies for water purifn. and desalination, highlight their inherent limitations and establish the urgent requirements for next-generation membranes. We then describe mol.-level design approaches towards fabricating highly selective membranes, focusing on novel materials such as aquaporin, synthetic nanochannels, graphene and self-assembled block copolymers and small mols. Finally, we highlight promising membrane surface modification approaches that minimize interfacial interactions and enhance fouling resistance.
Here, we report on a new concept for formation of mixed matrix reverse osmosis membranes by interfacial polymn. of nanocomposite thin films in-situ on porous polysulfone supports. Nanocomposite films created for this study comprise NaA zeolite nanoparticles dispersed within 50-200 nm thick polyamide films. Hand-cast pure polyamide membranes exhibit surface morphologies characteristic of com. polyamide RO membranes, whereas nanocomposite membranes have measurably smoother and more hydrophilic, neg. charged surfaces. At the highest nanoparticle loadings tested, hand-cast nanocomposite film morphol. is visibly different and pure water permeability is nearly double that of hand-cast polyamide membranes with equiv. solute rejections. Comparison of membranes formed using pore-filled and pore-opened zeolites suggest nanoparticle pores play an active role in water permeation and solute rejection. The best performing nanocomposite membranes exhibit permeability and rejection characteristics comparable to com. RO membranes. As a concept, thin film nanocomposite membrane technol. may offer new degrees of freedom in tailoring RO membrane sepn. performance and material properties.
There is a huge scope for graphene-based materials to be used as membranes for desalination. A very recent study has confirmed that 100% salt rejection can be achieved for commonly used ions by utilizing single layer nonporous graphene. However, the cost effective fabrication procedure for graphene oxide membranes with precise control of pore size can offer a practical soln. for filtration if one can achieve 100% percent salt rejection.
For the first time, a laminar sepn. membrane was assembled from atom-thick (chem. exfoliated) MoS2 sheets and exhibited a water permeance of 245 L h-1 m-2 bar-1, which was 3-5 times higher than that of graphene oxide membranes without degrdn. of the rejection ratio (89%) for Evans blue mols.

Microfiltration (MF) followed by reverse osmosis (RO) and soil-aquifer treatment (SAT) are the 2 principal technologies considered for indirect potable reuse of wastewater. This study, conducted at the Northwest Water Reclamation Plant, Mesa (Arizona), evaluated MF/RO and SAT (>6 mo residence time) treated tertiary effluent with respect to orgs. removal. Effluent org. matter was characterized as total org. C (TOC), by UV absorbance (UVA), solid-state 13C NMR spectroscopy, and size exclusion chromatog. Several trace org. micropollutants, including EDTA, NTA, and alkylphenolethoxylate residues, were analyzed by GC/MS. The study revealed that final TOC concns. of MF/RO and SAT are 0.3 and 1.0 mg/L, resp. Based on the characterization techniques used, the character of bulk orgs. present in final SAT water resembles the character of natural org. matter present in drinking water. Depending on the mol. wt. cut-off, RO membranes can efficiently reject high mol. wt. org. matter (characterized as humic and fulvic acids). However, approx. 40-50% of the remaining TOC in permeates consists of low mol. wt. acids and neutrals representing a mol. wt. of .ltorsim.500 Da. In the SAT treated effluent, EDTA and APECs were removed to approx. 4.3 and 0.54 μg/L, resp., but were below the detection limit in the MF/RO treated effluent.
The reuse of effluents for irrigation and indirect potable water uses is rapidly developing as an alternative to seawater desalination. This paper explores 2 membrane-based options available to treat sewage for water reuse, tertiary filtration (TF) of the effluent from a conventional activated sludge (CAS) process and an integrated membrane bioreactor (MBR). These options are compared from tech., performance and cost points of view using ZeeWeed immersed membranes. The anal. shows that an integrated MBR is less expensive than the CAS-TF option. The total life cycle costs for the treatment of sewage to a quality suitable for irrigation reuse or for feeding reverse osmosis decrease from 0.40 to 0.20 m3 as plant size increases to 75,000 m3/day. It is also shown that the incremental life cycle cost to treat sewage to indirect potable water reuse stds. (i.e. by ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis) is only 39% of the cost of seawater desalination.
Wastewater reuse presents a promising soln. to the growing pressure on water resources. However, wastewater reuse implementation faces obstacles that include insufficient public acceptance, tech., economic and hygienic risks and further uncertainties caused by a lack of awareness, accepted stds., uniform guidelines and legislation. So far, there are no supra-national regulations on water reuse in Europe and further development is slowed by lack of widely accepted stds., e.g. in terms of required water quality, treatment technol. and distribution system design and operation. Treatment technol. encompasses a vast no. of options and membrane processes are regarded as key elements of advanced wastewater reclamation and reuse schemes and are included in a no. of prominent schemes world-wide, e.g. for artificial groundwater recharge, indirect potable reuse as well as for industrial process water prodn. For dual reticulation purposes in urban areas 2 types of systems have been built, a centralized type of treatment with dual membrane processes, including e.g. microfiltration and reverse osmosis, and small scale systems using membrane bioreactors. This paper presents the status of membranes processes in wastewater reclamation and reuse world-wide and depicts their potential role in promoting more sustainable water use patterns.
A review discusses the increasing use of renewable energy technologies in desalination systems around the world. It also outlines the various types of renewable energy technologies and provide examples of where these are being used to power desalination technologies.
N-nitrosamine removal by reverse osmosis for indirect potable water reuse - A critical review based on observations from laboratory-, pilot- and full-scale studies
A review. N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and several other N-nitrosamines have been identified as probable human carcinogens. Here, key aspects related to the occurrence and removal of N-nitrosamines by reverse osmosis (RO) membranes in the context of indirect potable water reuse are reviewed. A comprehensive anal. of the existing data reveals significant variations in the rejection of NDMA by RO membranes reported in the literature, ranging from negligible ≤86%. This review article provides some insight into the reasons for such variations by examg. the available data on the effects of operating conditions on NDMA rejection. Amongst several operating parameters investigated so far in the literature, feed temp., membrane permeate flux, feed soln. pH and ionic strength were found to have considerable impact on NDMA rejection by RO membranes. In particular, it was recently shown that seasonal changes in feed temp. (e.g. from 20 to 30°) can result in a significant decrease in NDMA rejection (from 49 to 25%). However, the combined effects of all operating parameters identified in the literature to date can only account for some of the variations in NDMA rejection that were obsd. in full-scale RO plants. The impacts of membrane fouling and particularly chem. cleaning on the rejection of N-nitrosamines were not fully investigated. Finally, this review article presents a roadmap for further research required to optimize the rejection of NDMA and other N-nitrosamines by RO membranes.
The membrane bioreactor (MBR), a combination of the conventional activated-sludge process (ASP) and membrane sepn., can produce a consistently high quality of effluent from municipal wastewater. Successful pilot studies have already demonstrated the advantages of MBR technol. for reclaiming the domestic sewage in Singapore. The objective of this pilot study was to further investigate a new option of the MBR-RO (revers osmosis) process to produce high-grade water directly from domestic sewage. The MBR-RO process was evaluated over 5 mo for its ability to produce better quality effluent. Trial runs on various fluxes of the RO membrane were conducted. Comparison of the new MBR-RO process to the conventional ASP-MF (microfiltration)-RO process was also made. The results showed that the new MBR-RO process demonstrated the capability of producing the same or more consistent product quality (in terms of TOC, NH4+, and NO3-) as compared to the conventional ASP-MF-RO process in reclamation of domestic sewage. RO membranes in the MBR-RO process could be operated at 22 L/m2-h without CIP (cleaning in place) during the whole study period of 5 mo, which was 30% higher than that (17 L/m2-h) in the ASP-UF-RO process for NEWater prodn. RO permeate quality was improved with increasing the membrane flux. It was concluded that the MBR-RO process could be a new option for NEWater prodn.
A review. Osmosis is a phys. phenomenon that has been extensively studied by scientists in various disciplines of science and engineering. Early researchers studied the mechanism of osmosis through natural materials, and from the 1960s, special attention has been given to osmosis through synthetic materials. Following the progress in membrane science in the last few decades, esp. for reverse osmosis applications, the interests in engineered applications of osmosis has been spurred. Osmosis, or as it is currently referred to as forward osmosis, has new applications in sepn. processes for wastewater treatment, food processing, and seawater/brackish water desalination. Other unique areas of forward osmosis research include pressure-retarded osmosis for generation of electricity from saline and fresh water and implantable osmotic pumps for controlled drug release. This paper provides the state-of-the-art of the phys. principles and applications of forward osmosis as well as their strengths and limitations.
A review. Forward osmosis (FO) has been extensively investigated in the past decade. Despite significant advancements in our understanding of the FO process, questions and challenges remain regarding the energy efficiency and current state of the technol. Here, we critically review several key aspects of the FO process, focusing on energy efficiency, membrane properties, draw solutes, fouling reversibility, and effective applications of this emerging technol. We analyze the energy efficiency of the process, disprove the common misguided notion that FO is a low energy process, and highlight the potential use of low-cost energy sources. We address the key necessary membrane properties for FO, stressing the importance of the structural parameter, reverse solute flux selectivity, and the constraints imposed by the permeability-selectivity tradeoff. We then dispel the notion that draw soln. regeneration can use negligible energy, highlighting the beneficial qualities of small inorg. and thermolytic salts as draw solutes. We further discuss the fouling propensity of FO, emphasizing the fouling reversibility of FO compared to reverse osmosis (RO) and the prospects of FO in treating high fouling potential feed waters. Lastly, we discuss applications where FO outperforms other desalination technologies and emphasize that the FO process is not intended to replace RO, but rather is to be used to process feed waters that cannot be treated by RO.
A review. Recently, forward osmosis (FO) has attracted growing attention in many potential applications such as power generation, desalination, wastewater treatment and food processing. However, there are still several crit. challenges, including concn. polarization, membrane fouling, reverse solute diffusion and the need for new membrane development and draw solute design in FO. These challenges are also the current research focus on FO. This paper aims to review the recent developments in FO, focusing on the opportunities and challenges. It begins with discussing the advantages of the FO process over pressure-driven membrane processes. These potential advantages lie in FO's low energy consumption, low fouling propensity, reduced or easy cleaning, low costs, high salt rejection and high water flux. Next, the recent applications of FO, as the outcomes of the above advantages, are described. The key part of this review is a detailed discussion of five crit. challenges faced by FO and their relationships. Finally, the future of FO is viewed. This review provides a clear outline for FO-concerned researchers on the recent developments in FO.
A review. Research in the field of Forward Osmosis (FO) membrane technol. has grown significantly over the last 10 years, but its application in the scope of wastewater treatment has been slower. Drinking water is becoming an increasingly marginal resource. Substituting drinking water for alternate water sources, specifically for use in industrial processes, may alleviate the global water stress. FO has the potential to sustainably treat wastewater sources and produce high quality water. FO relies on the osmotic pressure difference across the membrane to ext. clean water from the feed, however the FO step is still mostly perceived as a "pre-treatment" process. To prompt FO-wastewater feasibility, the focus lies with new membrane developments, draw solns. to enhance wastewater treatment and energy recovery, and operating conditions. Optimization of these parameters are essential to mitigate fouling, decrease concn. polarisation and increase FO performance; issues all closely related to one another. This review attempts to define the steps still required for FO to reach full-scale potential in wastewater treatment and water reclamation by discussing current novelties, bottlenecks and future perspectives of FO technol. in the wastewater sector.
A hybrid system combining a forward osmosis with a reverse osmosis seawater desalination process could reduce both energy requirements and environmental impacts by osmotic diln. of the seawater and concd. brine with an impaired low salinity stream, such as treated wastewater effluent. This study investigates the membrane fouling behavior in forward osmosis under conditions simulating the osmotic diln. process and the use of hydrodynamic methods without the use of cleaning chems., to control membrane fouling. Fouling runs with seawater or SWRO brine draw soln. and deionized (DI) water feed soln. showed insignificant water flux decline, which implies negligible effect of particulate and org. matter in the seawater/brine on fouling of the FO membrane support layer. Fouling of the membrane active layer was evaluated by using an enriched synthetic wastewater effluent contg. a mixt. of inorg. and org. foulants, focusing on the impact of permeate drag force on fouling layer formation. Higher permeate water flux causes an increase in concn. build-up of foulants at the membrane surface, thereby forming a dense inorg./org. combined fouling layer during FO fouling runs. Three hydrodynamic methods were also examd. for minimizing FO membrane fouling in the osmotic diln. process: (1) applying shear force on the membrane surface by increasing the cross-flow velocity, (2) using a feed-channel spacer to induce turbulence, and (3) employing pulsed flow to remove foulants from the membrane surface. These hydrodynamic methods substantially reduce fouling and flux decline rate.
This review focuses on the present status of forward osmosis (FO) niches in two main areas: seawater desalination and wastewater reuse. Specific applications for desalination and impaired-quality water treatment and reuse are described, as well as the benefits, advantages, challenges, costs and knowledge gaps on FO hybrid systems are discussed. FO can play a role as a bridge to integrate upstream and downstream water treatment processes, to reduce the energy consumption of the entire desalination or water recovery and reuse processes, thus achieving a sustainable soln. for the water-energy nexus. FO hybrid membrane systems showed to have advantages over traditional membrane process like high pressure reverse osmosis and nanofiltration for desalination and wastewater treatment: (i) chem. storage and feed water systems may be reduced for capital, operational and maintenance cost, (ii) water quality is improved, (iii) reduced process piping costs, (iv) more flexible treatment units, and (v) higher overall sustainability of the desalination and wastewater treatment process. Nevertheless, major challenges make FO systems not yet a com. viable technol., the most crit. being the development of a high flux membrane, capable of maintaining an elevated salt rejection and a reduced internal concn. polarization effect, and the availability of appropriate draw solns. (cost effective and non-toxic), which can be recirculated via an efficient recovery process. This review article highlights the features of hybrid FO systems and specifically provides the state-of-the-art applications in the water industry in a novel classification and based on the latest developments toward scaling up these systems.
An innovative osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) is currently under development, based on forward osmosis (FO) driven by an osmotic pressure difference. For the OMBR to be both tech. and economically viable, the performance of the FO membranes has to be sufficiently high, while membrane fouling and draw soln. leakage has to be low. The effect of temp., membrane type, membrane orientation, type and concn. of draw soln. was studied to optimize FO membrane performance using deionized water. Membrane fouling and draw soln. leakage was studied in this work by lab. scale FO expts. using an activated sludge soln. from a membrane bioreactor (MBR). The best FO performance with an activated sludge soln. was found with a FO-type membrane (J = 6.2 L/m2/h at 20 ± 2° with 0.5M NaCl corresponding to π = 24 bar). Draw solns. from salts consisting of monovalent ions (NaCl and NaNO3) performed better than salts consisting of bivalent ions (MgSO4 and ZnSO4), while the flux of the FO membrane were non-linearly related to the concn. of the draw soln. Internal concn. polarization did hamper the FO performance as a result of the thickness and structure of the porous substructure of the studied membranes. Both reversible and irreversible membrane fouling were not found during the FO expts. using activated sludge solns. No substantial draw soln. leakage was found for the FO membranes at various draw soln. concns. for different draw solns.
Performance of a novel osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) system: Flux stability and removal of trace organics
Results reported here highlight the potential and several challenges in the development of a novel osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) process for the treatment of municipal wastewater. Following the initial gradual decline, a stable permeate flux value was obtained after approx. four days of continuous operation. There was evidence of continuous deterioration of biol. activity of the OMBR system, possibly due to the build-up of salinity in the reactor. The removal of 25 out of 27 trace org. compds. with mol. wt. higher than 266 g/mol was above 80% and was possibly governed by the interplay between phys. sepn. of the FO membrane and biodegrdn. In contrast, the removal efficiency values of the other 23 trace org. compds. with mol. wt. less than 266 g/mol were very scattered. The removal efficiency of these low mol. wt. compds. by OMBR treatment appears to depend mostly on biol. degrdn.
A review. Osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) is an emerging technol. integrating a forward osmosis (FO) process into a membrane bioreactor (MBR). This technol. has been gaining increasing popularity in wastewater treatment and reclamation due to its excellent product water quality, low fouling tendency and high fouling reversibility over conventional MBRs. In the past decade esp. the last 3 years, novel insights and significant advancements have been achieved in many aspects of OMBR accompanied with greatly increased no. of published papers. This paper attempts to critically review the recent developments in OMBRs and to present a clear outline for further studies. Firstly, OMBR fundamentals including its configuration and FO process are presented. Subsequently, performance of OMBRs is summarized and compared to conventional MBRs. Addnl., mechanisms, impacts and mitigations of salt accumulation and membrane fouling related to the core challenge of low water flux in OMBRs are addressed. Finally, future research prospects are discussed in order to further improve OMBR technol. and drive it from lab. research to real practical applications.
The osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) is a hybrid biol.-phys. treatment process that has been gaining interest for wastewater treatment and water reuse. The OMBR couples semi-permeable forward osmosis (FO) membranes for physiochem. sepn. with biol. activated sludge process for org. matter and nutrient removal. The driving force for water prodn. in OMBR is the osmotic pressure difference across the FO membrane between the activated sludge and a concd. draw soln., which is made with inorg. or org. salts that have a high osmotic pressure at relatively low concns. The draw soln. becomes dild. during OMBR treatment and may be reconcd. using reverse osmosis, membrane distn., or thermal distn. processes. The combination of processes in the OMBR presents unique opportunities but also challenges that must be addressed in order to achieve successful commercialization. These challenges include membrane fouling, elevated bioreactor salinity that hinders process performance, degrdn. of the draw soln. by chems. that diffuse through the FO membrane, and the potential for simultaneous water, mineral, and nutrient recovery. In this article, results from past and most recent OMBR studies are summarized and critically reviewed. Information about similar and more established technologies (e.g., traditional porous membrane bioreactors and FO) is included to help compare and contrast state-of-the-art technologies and the novel OMBR approach, and to elucidate practical configurations that should be considered in future OMBR research and development.
Performance of a submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor with forward osmosis membrane for low-strength wastewater treatment
A submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor with forward osmosis membrane (FO-AnMBR) was operated at 25 °C for the treatment of synthetic wastewater. As the expt. progressed, the water flux reduced due to the membrane fouling and the increasing salinity in the reactor, and achieved at around 3.5 LMH in one cycle. It was worth noting that the level of salinity in the reactor was not a concern in terms of inhibition or toxic effects on the biol. processes. The FO-AnMBR process exhibited greater than 96% removal of org. carbon, nearly 100% of total phosphorus and 62% of ammonia-nitrogen, resp., suggesting a better removal efficiency than the conventional anaerobic membrane bioreactor. The methane and carbon dioxide compns. achieved concns. of around 65%-78% and 22%-35%, resp.; and no obvious difference in the biogas compn. was obsd. with the changes of cond. With respect to the methane yield, an av. value of 0.21 L CH4 g-1 COD was obtained, exhibiting the feasibility of energy recovery by this FO-AnMBR system. Addnl., an increase in the salinity enhanced the accumulation of sol. microbial products, esp. for the proteins with 88.9% increment as the cond. increased from 1.2 to 17.3 ms cm-1. In contrast, a relatively stable concn. of extracellular polymer substances (EPS) was obsd., indicating that the influence of cond. on EPS cannot be directly correlated.
Preliminary study of osmotic membrane bioreactor: effects of draw solution on water flux and air scouring on fouling
Preliminary study on a novel osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) was explored. Objective of this study was to investigate the effects of draw soln. on membrane flux and air scouring at the feed side on fouling tendency in a pilot OMBR system composing the anoxic/aerobic and forward osmosis (FO) processes. Domestic sewage was the raw feed, FO membrane from HTI and NaCl/MgSO4 draw solns. were used in the expts. Fluxes of 3 l/m2/h (LMH) and 7.2 LMH were achieved at osmotic pressure of 5 and 22.4 atm, resp. No significant flux decline was obsd. at 3 LMH over 190 h and at 7.2 LMH over 150 h when air scouring was provided at the feed side of the membrane. However, without air scouring, the flux at 22.4 atm osmotic pressure declined by 30% after 195 h and then levelled off. The potential advantages of the fouling reversibility with air scouring under the operating conditions of the pilot OMBR and better water quality in OMBR over the conventional MBR were preliminarily demonstrated.
Osmotic membrane bioreactor for wastewater treatment and the effect of salt accumulation on system performance and microbial community dynamics
An osmotic membrane bioreactor was developed for wastewater treatment. The effects of salt accumulation on system performance and microbial community dynamics were investigated. Evident deterioration of biol. activity, esp. nitrification, was obsd., which resulted in significant accumulation of org. matter and NH4+-N within the bioreactor. Arising from the elevation of salinity, almost all the dominant species was taken over by high salt-tolerant species. Significant succession among different species of Nitromonas was obsd. for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. For nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, Nitrospira was not evidently affected, whereas Nitrobacter was eliminated from the system. Salt accumulation also caused significant shifts in denitrifying bacterial community from α- to γ-Proteobacteria members. Overall, the microbial community adapted to the elevated salinity conditions and brought about a rapid recovery of the biol. activity. Membrane fouling occurred but was insignificant. Biofouling and inorg. scaling coexisted, with magnesium/calcium phosphate/carbonate compds. identified as the inorg. foulants.
This study examd. long-term stability of forward osmosis (FO) membranes against biodegrdn. during prolonged exposure to activated sludge. Results show that cellulose triacetate (CTA) membranes were more resistant against biodegrdn. than polyamide thin film composite (TFC) ones. Nevertheless, CTA membrane biodegrdn. was discernible after 7 mo of exposure to activated sludge as manifested by an increase in the membrane av. pore size, water and salt permeability, and membrane structural parameter. As a result, of prolonged exposure to activated sludge, the water and reverse salt fluxes of the CTA membrane increased; and concomitantly the rejection of a range of trace org. contaminants decreased significantly. The impact of prolonged exposure to activated sludge on the polyamide active layer of TFC FO membranes was even more severe. Our results indicate that currently available com. CTA and polyamide TFC FO membranes may not be readily compatible for practical osmotic membrane bioreactor (OMBR) operation. Thus, the development of new and robust FO membrane materials specifically designed for membrane bioreactor operation is essential for com. OMBR applications.

Chicago-based dance music trio Krewella have never been shy for the cameras, and their tour antics have even gone viral in their KREWLIFE web series. This time around, director Miles Evert offers a peek into a more emotional aspect of the electropunk sensation with a visual set to “Human.” In two short years, the trifecta has gone from playing illegal warehouse raves to becoming one of the biggest names in dance music. Their freshman album “Get Wet” debuted at #8 on Billboard’s Hot 100, their hit single “Alive,” recently achieved platinum status, and they’ve sold out venues around the world. However, all of their success did not come without a toll. Their new music video depicts the struggles they’ve endured and their human vulnerability through their journey.
In conjunction with the release of their new video for “Human,” Krewella have announced their partnership with Dance For Paralysis and Electric Family. “Our goal is to provide the proper medical resources for those with paralysis so that one day they can join us for a dance,” says Thomas Smith. Smith founded Dance For Paralysis after he sustained a second paralyzing hockey injury in October 2009. “All parties involved strongly believe that by working together, we will become a beacon of hope for those living with paralysis.” 100% of the proceeds from the Krewella bracelet will be donated directly to Dance For Paralysis.
Electric Family is an EDM lifestyle brand that allows artists to support their charity of choice through a custom artist series bracelet. Co-founder of Electric Family, Steve Brudzewski, says, “It is our mission, along with Krewella’s, to show the world that together we can make a significant impact improving the lives of others.”

"The act of addressing darkness is inherently optimistic": DiS Meets Hilary Woods about 17 hours ago
we're releasing our new single - "paper cuts" on 6th june, it'll be on itunes and available in handmade copies at gigs
we've recorded a video for the single too which you can see here - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwOqPCnubw0
it was filmed by the lovely chaps at squarelips who also did the rather excellent "a rumour in africa" video for errors amongst other marvellous things
we're also playing the captains rest in glasgow on 10th june and should have some other shows further north & south in the near future and an album "do no harm" later in the year.
What do you percieve as being the advantage? Do you think that people will mistakenly turn up to gigs thinking you're the other band somehow reformed? What possible benefit do you get from this ridiculous doppleganger name?
as most logical people would think there is no way a band would have the audacity to claim such a similar name it is quite easy to conclude they are one and the same but with a typo. the name causes confusion and dissapointment and then anger
as we've said about 100 times (99 of which have been on here) we'd never heard of them when we started the band, they contacted us, threatened to sue us and then promptly split up. and no we wont be changing the band name but cheers for the suggestion
dont blame them for wanting to take action, once a band has become pretty established its understandable they wouldnt want a band using a near identical name, if they hadnt split up im sure it could have lead to a lot of confusion and hassle on their part.
just thought it was pretty funny that they didn't just ask us, instead they sent us a threatening email via their lawyers. DIY4life!
but dont think it is as bad as its one word and its plural, think most people could understand it being used independently by 2 bands but when it is a multiple word band name sharing a couple of words and exactly the same idea I think its different.
Battles are called Battles and everybody knows they are called Battles. Their name is a couple of letters away from a famous scouse band, but the name means and evokes totally different things. Plus, it is a one word name, and as such the word stands alone, meaning different things to different people.
The band name 'Q and not U' is a phrase. The phrase alludes to a convention of English spelling and there isn't much more to interpret from it. I'm guessing that your name isn't alluding to being 'in a queue without you' cos that would just be more shit. Your band name seems to mean exactly the same thing as their band name (unlike The Beatles and Battles).
If you want to give your shitty band a shitty name, be my guest, but don't expect people to be happy when they see threads with titles that suggest one of their favourite bands of the last decade have produced new material.
Fair enough you didn't know of them when you named the band, but if you want your band be judged on its own merit, give it a new name!
If you are just trying to piss people off to get a response, that's cool, here are some ideas for new band names:
To the band, what's the point in having a similar name to a well-known band? Do you want people always mistaking you for them or you just hope your fans won't know them? Like someone already pointed out, it just doesn't get along with common sense.
I mean, it's clearly aggravating a lot of people you are trying to woo on here. It's aggravating a well respected band of the type you aspire to emulate. It doesn't seem to gain you that much. Why not just change it? Is it just plain ol' stubborness? Can't think of a better one?
I mean, they probably should have googled the name before deciding on it, but whatever. I know neither of the bands in question, but even I know that the Q Without U is that band that post on dis sometimes that arent that other, more famous band... Confusion can always happen with band names anyway... i once got talking to a guy who was in a Neil Young tribute band, he told me some story about a couple that came to one of their shows and afterwards came up to him and said 'very good, I enjoyed that... but why didn't you play Sweet Caroline?'
but at least they were amusing, unlike the foaming at the mouth ham-fisted "FUCKING CHANGE IT YOU FUCKS THIS IS SRS BSNSS" replies from some other folks!
the people who are confused by the name, and probably fans of q and not u are unlikely to be into what we're doing anyway as it'll be a bit too "straightforward" or whatever. maybe we're wrong on that front and are alienating potential interest,who knows?
but if they choose to get themselves all hot under the collar about it in the process why would we care?
but I don't think that you're as far apart as you seem to think. Your stubbornness will hold you back.
1. Glanced at the title of this thread while at work and thought an awesome band had got back together.
2. Waited for my producer to leave the room so i could watch the vid, all the while feeling pretty excited.
That actually just happened. And not just for me I imagine. Well done. Your stubbornness and lack of foresight is really paying dividends isn't it? And for the record - if you'd never heard of Q and not U you had no business starting a band. Good day.
obviously it's interesting,and depressing in equal meausre, that you'd you'd be so aghast at our deception that we'd go straight on the hate list
But so are Wolf Parade and Wolfmother. In fact the number of fucking bands out there with 'Black' in their title, 'Wolf', 'Tiger', 'Bear' or indeed any other animal is quite amazing, yet no one spends ages telling Black Elk they need to change their name because Black Flag, Big Black and Black Sabbath were already out there...
Their profile lists them as 25 so I'm prepared to assume that part was some tongue-in-cheek hyperbole.
these bands are the same phrase worded slightly differently. it is confusing, im well aware of the two bands and even i still managed to think this was a thread about q and not u, i was even going to jokingly post 'ah man I thought this would be a thread about q without u' then I realised it actually was
The problem in this instance is not only that the band names look so similar, but also that they share the exact same concept. Also, the single letters 'Q' and 'U' are generally much less common in band names than words such as 'wolf' or 'black'. I've never had a problem with misreading any of the band names you have listed, but I repeatedly have such an issue with threads concerning 'Q Without U'. My reason for posting here was mainly to advise the band anyway. Sure, I find it mildly annoying and disappointing, but I'll live. The DiS contrarians have joined the thread now anyway, so feel free to disagree guys.
Every time we get a Q Without U thread we get this rubbish. Now I'll admit when I first saw them I had to check again, but equally I saw 'Wolf People' listed as supporting someone recently and thought it was 'Wolf Parade' for a second.
It's now about 'contrarians' it's simply disbelief that people can spend so much time having a go at a band for having a similar name to another band OVER AN OVER AGAIN.
I don't buy your 'share the exact same concept' point. Similar band names are just similar. I find it hilarious there's a discussion up there where people try to defend Battles vs. Battle (and The Beatles - comedy!) as totally different too, as if this particular instance sits in its own little world of special.
It's certainly a factor, for me at least. I'm not saying that the issue in this instance exists completely separately from the seemingly similar examples that you previously mentioned, but surely the repeated fuss that is kicked in every one of these threads tells you something about the perceived magnitude of this band-name-similarity-drama in relation to the others? tbh the strength of my feelings on this topic have almost completely waned now. I'll agree to disagree and that.
and "the name causes confusion and dissapointment and then anger" still has me pissing myself. This thread is DiS cunt soup.
confusion because q and not u have split up, dissapointed that they havent reformed, anger that q without u stilll knowingly do this
Only Q also doubles up as the name of my pretty niche James Bond character lookalike agency. We're looking to expand soon.
you stick to your guns, however i would like to point out that both are fucking terribles names for a band and i would probably change it for that reason....not because these confused, disappointed and angry people tell you to.
Both are fucking terrible names anyway and make me think of annoying whiny American college kids self-harming*
I'm enjoying the stubbornness of keeping a blatantly stupid band name even when given an easy out to change it just cause you can
Is that a lot of people won't have ever heard of Q and not U. A lot of people will have heard them, and will be entirely indifferent to the similarity in name alone.
Fair enough, I say. And frankly, if you did name the band Q without U explicitly to piss off uptight indie-fan types, then even better. It's a quality way to push their silly buttons.
I'm now more interested in this band, without having ever heard them before, as a direct result of this name palava. Good work.
i don't remember a thread that wasn't about foals or luke leighfield attracting these kinds of numbers on the music board for quite some time!
seems like an easy way to undermine opinions that differ from yours without having to rely on the strength of your side of the argument. also seems weird that people are critical of opinions such as mine are being just as stubborn, practice what you preach and stop miffling at people who dont agree with you
The Chemical Brothers originally chose to pay homage to their heroes The Dust Brothers by calling themselves errr...The Dust Brothers.
was searching for Q Without U as their single (mentioned somewhere above) just came out. Kudos and LOL smileyfaces to all the DiSters who've contributed to this, either via their amusing responses later in the thread, or those who kicked it off with their complete fuckwittery in taking offence at something so trivial.
until someone comes on to jag female synthpopper and recent Marina & the Diamonds support Spark and everyone asks where the bloke with the tache has gone.
FUCKING HELL, GUYS. Some of you are twats. Mainly those of you calling others twats. If you just want to piss about with a few mates, then who gives a fuck what your name is? If you want to actually have some level of success though, you'd have to be literally retarded not to realise sticking with a name so similar to that of an already popular band is like the Robert Green of marketing decisions. And of course marketing plays a comparable role to simply producing the best music you possibly can. It's totally naive to think you can have one without the other. I don't care either way though, obviously. I have no emotional investment in the band. I'm just a good Samaritan, spreading my wisdom.
I live in North Shields. Our band will practice near there. Are there actually any people posting on here who want to be in bands that aren't from London or Manchester? If you a) Are musical (can pick a chord a go 'twang') and b) live within travelling distance of NE1 and c) want to be in a fuzzy droney stoner jazz ensemble, my email is self_impressed@yahoo.com
Nope, our TV which only about 4 years old last night decided to start displaying with everything under a shade of blue.
means something to do with magnets. or something. I once stuck a magnet to our TV when I was younger, and it went blue and we had to throw it out. Does Mr Slicky play with magnets?
not that I'm aware of anyway, maybe it's one of those marriage 'secrets' MAGNET OBSESSION RUNIED MY LIFE jobs.
Unlikely though, it happened during 7 samurai, i think it was protesting at the rubbishness of said film
get another cathode ray one, the other types are *really bad* for the environment and use laods of power.
although there might have been some distinction between plasma and LCD tvs too. Hang on, i'll see what I can find
"Plasma TVs use four times more energy than cathode ray TVs. If everyone in the UK upgraded their TVs to Plasma, we would need to generate 2.5G more energy - ie we would need two new nuclear power stations (or their equivilent)

I'm really in the need for a stroll. Need to go buy fags anyway. But I'm not sure I DARE. There's something about this part of this town..
It's just here i can choose to either walk to bike path way which is just trees and scary noises all the way to the shop, OR the well lit but odd people way.
a personal attack alarm when i started a temp job (at a department store) t'other week.. apparently because the street outside the staff entrance is right dodgy at night!
load of rubbish tho. mostly i walk all over the place and it's fine... never had any trouble in hull. different story when i lived in birmingham tho!
Don't you live on the same street as the college? Not that i stalk you.. but you always walk down that alley when I've leapt off campus for a crafty cigarette during IT.
as I got hit by someone in the daytime and went a bit 'dainty' for a bit. So that was 6 months of record money down the drain though

There are several different types of oral laxatives and they work in different ways. Since directions for use are different for each type, it is important to know which one you are taking. The different types of oral laxatives include:
Bulk-formers—Bulk-forming laxatives are not digested but absorb liquid in the intestines and swell to form a soft, bulky stool. The bowel is then stimulated normally by the presence of the bulky mass. Some bulk-forming laxatives, like psyllium and polycarbophil, may be prescribed by your doctor to treat diarrhea.
Hyperosmotics—Hyperosmotic laxatives encourage bowel movements by drawing water into the bowel from surrounding body tissues. This provides a soft stool mass and increased bowel action.
There are three types of hyperosmotic laxatives taken by mouth—the saline, the lactulose , and the polymer types. The saline type is often called ''salts.'' They are used for rapid emptying of the lower intestine and bowel. They are not used for long-term or repeated correction of constipation. With smaller doses than those used for the laxative effect, some saline laxatives are used as antacids. The information that follows applies only to their use as laxatives. Sodium phosphate may also be prescribed for other conditions as determined by your doctor.
The lactulose type is a special sugar-like laxative that works the same way as the saline type. However, it produces results much more slowly and is often used for long-term treatment of chronic constipation. Lactulose may sometimes be used in the treatment of certain medical conditions to reduce the amount of ammonia in the blood. It is available only with your doctor's prescription.
The polymer type is a polyglycol (polyethylene glycol), a large molecule that causes water to be retained in the stool; this will soften the stool and increase the number of bowel movements. It is used for short periods of time to treat constipation.
Lubricants—Lubricant laxatives, such as mineral oil, taken by mouth encourage bowel movements by coating the bowel and the stool mass with a waterproof film. This keeps moisture in the stool. The stool remains soft and its passage is made easier.
Stimulants—Stimulant laxatives, also known as contact laxatives, encourage bowel movements by acting on the intestinal wall. They increase the muscle contractions that move along the stool mass. Stimulant laxatives are a popular type of laxative for self-treatment. However, they also are more likely to cause side effects. One of the stimulant laxatives, dehydrocholic acid, may also be used for treating certain conditions of the biliary tract.
Stool softeners (emollients)—Stool softeners encourage bowel movements by helping liquids mix into the stool and prevent dry, hard stool masses. This type of laxative has been said not to cause a bowel movement but instead allows the patient to have a bowel movement without straining.
Combinations—There are many products that you can buy for constipation that contain more than one type of laxative. For example, a product may contain both a stool softener and a stimulant laxative. In general, combination products may be more likely to cause side effects because of the multiple ingredients. In addition, they may not offer any advantage over products containing only one type of laxative. If you are taking a combination laxative, make certain you know the proper use and precautions for each of the different ingredients .
following a period of poor eating habits or a lack of physical exercise in order to develop normal bowel function (bulk-forming laxatives only).
for simple constipation that happens on occasion (although another type of laxative may be preferred).
Most laxatives are available without a prescription; however, your doctor may have special instructions for the proper use and dose for your medical condition. They are available in the following dosage forms:
Importance of diet, fluids, and exercise to prevent constipation—Laxatives are to be used to provide short-term relief only, unless otherwise directed by a doctor. A proper diet containing roughage (whole grain breads and cereals, bran, fruit, and green, leafy vegetables), with 6 to 8 full glasses (8 ounces each) of liquids each day, and daily exercise are most important in maintaining healthy bowel function. Also, for individuals who have problems with constipation, foods such as pastries, puddings, sugar, candy, cake, and cheese may make the constipation worse.
If you are taking this medicine without a prescription, carefully read and follow any precautions on the label. For oral laxatives, the following should be considered:
Allergies—Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to laxatives. Also tell your health care professional if you are allergic to any other substances, such as foods, preservatives, or dyes.
Diet—Make certain your health care professional knows if you are on any special diet, such as a low-sodium or low-sugar diet. Some laxatives have large amounts of sodium or sugars in them.
Pregnancy—Although laxatives are often used during pregnancy, some types are better than others. Stool softeners (emollient) laxatives and bulk-forming laxatives are probably used most often. If you are using a laxative during pregnancy, remember that:
Some laxatives (in particular, the bulk-formers) contain a large amount of sodium or sugars, which may have possible unwanted effects such as increasing blood pressure or causing water to be held in the body.
Saline laxatives containing magnesium, potassium, or phosphates may have to be avoided if your kidney function is not normal.
Mineral oil is usually not used during pregnancy because of possible unwanted effects on the mother or infant. Mineral oil may interfere with the absorption of nutrients and vitamins in the mother. Also, if taken for a long time during pregnancy, mineral oil may cause severe bleeding in the newborn infant.
Stimulant laxatives may cause unwanted effects in the expectant mother if improperly used. Castor oil in particular should not be used as it may cause contractions of the womb.
Breast-feeding—Laxatives containing cascara and danthron may pass into the breast milk. Although the amount of laxative in the milk is generally thought to be too small to cause problems in the baby, your doctor should be told if you plan to use such laxatives. Some reports claim that diarrhea has been caused in the infant.
Children—Laxatives should not be given to young children (up to 6 years of age) unless prescribed by their doctor . Since children usually cannot describe their symptoms very well, they should be checked by a doctor before being given a laxative. The child may have a condition that needs other treatment. If so, laxatives will not help, and may even cause unwanted effects or make the condition worse.
Mineral oil should not be given to young children (up to 6 years of age) because a form of pneumonia may be caused by the inhalation of oil droplets into the lungs.
Also, bisacodyl tablets should not be given to children up to 6 years of age because if chewed they may cause stomach irritation.
Older adults—Mineral oil should not be taken by bedridden elderly persons because a form of pneumonia may be caused by the inhalation of oil droplets into the lungs. Also, stimulant laxatives (e.g., bisacodyl or casanthranol), if taken too often, may worsen weakness, lack of coordination, or dizziness and light-headedness.
Polyethylene glycol 3350 should be discontinued if diarrhea occurs, especially in elderly persons in nursing homes.
Other medicines—Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking oral laxatives, it is especially important that your health care professional know if you are taking any of the following:
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate—Use of magnesium-containing laxatives will keep these medicines from working
Tetracyclines taken by mouth (medicine for infection)—Use of bulk-forming or magnesium-containing laxatives will keep the tetracycline medicine from working
Other medical problems—The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of oral laxatives. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially:
Type 2 diabetes mellitus—Diabetic patients should be careful since some laxatives contain large amounts of sugars, such as dextrose, galactose, and/or sucrose
High blood pressure—Some laxatives contain large amounts of sodium, which may make these conditions worse
Kidney disease—Magnesium and potassium (contained in some laxatives) may build up in the body if kidney disease is present; a serious condition may develop
Swallowing difficulty—Mineral oil should not be used since it may get into the lungs by accident and cause pneumonia; also, bulk-forming laxatives may get lodged in the esophagus of patients who have difficulty in swallowing
With all kinds of laxatives, at least 6 to 8 glasses (8 ounces each) of liquids should be taken each day. This will help make the stool softer.
To allow bulk-forming laxatives to work properly and to prevent intestinal blockage, it is necessary to drink plenty of fluids during their use. Each dose should be taken in or with a full glass (8 ounces) or more of cold water or fruit juice. This will provide enough liquid for the laxative to work properly. A second glass of water or juice by itself is often recommended with each dose for best effect and to avoid side effects.
When taking a product that contains only a bulk-forming ingredient, results often may be obtained in 12 hours. However, this may not occur for some individuals until after 2 or 3 days.
When taking a product that contains only a stool softener, results usually occur 1 to 2 days after the first dose. However, this may not occur for some individuals until after 3 to 5 days.
Each dose should be taken in or with a full glass (8 ounces) or more of cold water or fruit juice. This will provide enough liquid for the laxative to work properly. A second glass of water or juice by itself is often recommended with each dose for best effect and, in the case of saline laxatives, to prevent you from becoming dehydrated.
The unpleasant taste produced by some hyperosmotic laxatives may be improved by following each dose with citrus fruit juice or citrus-flavored carbonated beverage.
Saline laxatives usually produce results within 1/2 to 3 hours following a dose. When a larger dose is taken on an empty stomach, the results are quicker. When a smaller dose is taken with food, the results are delayed. Therefore, large doses of saline laxatives are usually not taken late in the day on an empty stomach.
Mineral oil should not be taken within 2 hours of meals because of possible interference with food digestion and absorption of nutrients and vitamins.
Mineral oil is usually taken at bedtime (but not while lying down) for convenience and because it requires about 6 to 8 hours to produce results.
Stimulant laxatives are usually taken on an empty stomach for rapid effect. Results are slowed if taken with food.
Many stimulant laxatives (but not castor oil) are often taken at bedtime to produce results the next morning (although some may require 24 hours or more).
The unpleasant taste of castor oil may be improved by chilling in the refrigerator for at least an hour and then stirring the dose into a full glass of cold orange juice just before it is taken. Also, flavored preparations of castor oil are available.
Bisacodyl tablets are specially coated to allow them to work properly without causing irritation and/or nausea. To protect this coating, do not chew, crush, or take the tablets within an hour of milk or antacids.
Dosing—There are a large number of laxative products on the market. The dose of laxatives will be different for different products. The number of capsules or tablets or teaspoonfuls of crystals, gel, granules, liquid, or powder that you use; the number of caramels or wafers that you eat; or the number of pieces of gum that you chew depends on the strength of the medicine. Follow your doctor's orders if this medicine was prescribed, or follow the directions on the box if you are buying this medicine without a prescription .
Do not store the capsule, tablet, granules, or powder form of this medicine in the bathroom, near the kitchen sink, or in other damp places. Heat or moisture may cause the medicine to break down.
Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed. Be sure that any discarded medicine is out of the reach of children.
if you have signs of appendicitis or inflamed bowel (such as stomach or lower abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, soreness, nausea, or vomiting). Instead, check with your doctor as soon as possible.
for more than 1 week unless your doctor has prescribed or ordered a special schedule for you. This is true even when you have had no results from the laxative.
within 2 hours of taking other medicine because the desired effect of the other medicine may be reduced.
if you do not need it , as for the common cold, ''to clean out your system'' or as a ''tonic to make you feel better.''
if you develop a skin rash while taking a laxative or if you had a rash the last time you took it. Instead, check with your doctor.
If you notice a sudden change in bowel habits or function that lasts longer than 2 weeks , or that keeps returning off and on, check with your doctor before using a laxative. This will allow the cause of your problem to be determined before it may become more serious.
The ''laxative habit''—Laxative products are overused by many people. Such a practice often leads to dependence on the laxative action to produce a bowel movement. In severe cases, overuse of some laxatives has caused damage to the nerves, muscles, and tissues of the intestines and bowel. If you have any questions about the use of laxatives, check with your health care professional.
Many laxatives often contain large amounts of sugars, carbohydrates, and sodium. If you are on a low-sugar, low-caloric, or low-sodium diet, check with your health care professional before using a laxative.

This website is for those who love “out-of-body experience” (OBE), “lucid dreaming” and “astral projection” – only here they are all regarded as a single phenomenon: the phase state. No theorizing or nonsense here. Only what works in practice and nothing else!
The practice of phase states of the mind is the hottest and most promising pursuit of the modern age. Unlike in the past, the notions of out-of-body experience, lucid dreaming and astral projection have already lost their mystical halo, and their real basis has been studied in minute detail from the most non-nonsense approach. Now, this phenomenon is accessible to everyone, regardless of their worldview. It is now known how to easily master it and apply it effectively. This website gives each and every person something that previously could only be dreamt about – a parallel reality and the possibility of existing in two worlds.
The essence of the phase state (lucid dreaming and out-of-body experience) is that practitioners realize that they are outside their physical body, which they only remember and do not feel in any way. Instead, they find themselves in a space that is just as real in terms of perception and structure, yet in which they experience sensations that are even more intense than those of waking reality. One can also walk, touch, hear, see, eat, experience joy or pain, and much more. In addition, one can now fly, walk through walls, morph into other creatures, and so forth.
Compared to this, all other types of entertainment, including computer games and even drugs, look like child’s play. However, one can use this state to achieve various practical goals, and so entertainment becomes self-development. For example, one may obtain information from one’s sub-consciousness, travel, meet with various people (including the deceased), influence the physiology, develop creatively and artistically, fulfill desires, as well as master skills and abilities – and all this is only the tip of the iceberg of lucid dreaming!
“This FREE ebook is the result of our study of lucid dreams and out-of-body experience. It’s about how to achieve it, how to control it, and how to use it in everyday life. All facts presented in this book have been proven by vast numbers of practitioners and years of research around the world by Michael Raduga’s research center. And there’s no theorizing, but only hard facts and techniques.”
One of the most common issues that I am contacted with revolves around an inability to push their astral projection practice any further. Questions that I receive typically sound something like this:
“I have been lying here for over an hour. I am remaining completely still, but nothing is happening. What do I do?”
“I am starting to make progress, and I can feel my body starting to fall asleep, but the process won’t go any further. What am I doing wrong?”
“I am feeling tingling in my limbs and torso, but I just can’t get it to evolve into the vibrational state. What do I do next?”
This simple test was developed by teaching lucid dreaming to thousands of people. To get your score, give yourself 1 point for each true statement:
0-3 Points: You can still learn to have lucid dreamings, but will have more difficulty than others. It might take you dozens of tries to have your first lucid dream. Remember: lucid dreamings is something that everybody can achieve, and there aren’t people who are unable to enjoy this amazing practice.
4-6 Points: Moderate difficulty. It may take up to 10 solid attempts to have your first lucid dream. You already have a predisposition for this practice – you just need to fully activate it. Simply follow the instructions closely and you’ll be able to achieve untold heights in your personal practice.
7-10 Points: You have a strong predisposition for the practice of lucid dreaming. You should be able to do it in from one to several tries. Actually, it’s going to be easy for you to live in two worlds at once: the physical one and the world of lucid dreamings. Don’t let this opportunity slip by!

Wonder what is quantum physics? What a dummy you are! Get these 10 amazing quantum physics facts with pictures for dummies. Your world will never be the same after you take a look at these discoveries:
In 1803, Thomas Young sent a beam of light through an opaque plate with two slits in it. Instead of seeing the expected two lines on the viewing screen, he saw several lines, as if two waves of light from the two slits had been interfering (overlapping) with each other. It was the beginning of quantum physics. Every dummy should know it! Over the 20th and 21st centuries, it has been proven that not only light, but also individual elementary particles and even some molecules behave as waves – as if they were going through both slits at the same time. However, if you place a sensor at the slits that observes what exactly happens to the particle at that point, and which slit it finally ends up going through, then only two lines will appear on the projection screen, as if the fact of observation (indirect influence) collapses the wave function and the experiment subject behaves as a particle.

Given the amount of information out there about "going green" or buying "eco-friendly", it's difficult to know what's important and what's not. Ultimately, we all must make decisions we can live with based on the information we have at that point.
Ideally, the product should be produced closer to home, so it travels less distance to reach the customers, reducing the emissions and gas consumed, excess packaging needed for travels, and in the case of food, the use of preservatives. Also, avoid countries of origin that do not adhere to the same safety standards. I.e. China has a history for products that tested high in lead and plastics laced with Bisphenol A.
It can be hard to find the information on how products are manufactured, but it is worth the effort to do a bit of digging. What are the facilities like? How much energy do they use in production? Do they give back to the environment, or the community?
Many of us assume that products are made in environments similar to where we work - reasonable compensation, supportive management and colleagues and good working conditions. Apparently not. Do your best to ensure the products are made in a sustainable manner. Are the wages & working conditions fair? When products are manufactured abroad, does the company support fair trade and fair labour practices in the manufacture and production?
Take a look at what's in the products you purchase. Are the ingredients in your cleaning and personal care items organic, non-toxic and safe? (Recognizable terms are better). Avoid plastics when possible since they have high chemical use in production and even recycling eligible plastic requires significant energy consumption. Select products that are harvested in a sustainable manner, for example bamboo, hemp, or organic cotton. Consider recycled content in paper products like towels, tissue paper, notebooks, etc... Is the packaging recyclable?
Strive to purchase things that will last. While a deal is tempting, think of quality workmanship and longevity of the product. Where possible, avoid single-use products (i.e. plastic water bottles) and opt for a reusable choice. How does the product affect the environment when in use? I.e. can the detergent be used in more energy-saving cold water and is it biodegradable so it won't affect the water table? When disposing of a product, is it easily recyclable? Could it be repurposed elsewhere or donated?
You may not be able to address all of the criteria when selecting products, and we all know that life is a series of trade-offs and choices, but hopefully it gets easier to make the green ones.
Eco-friendly bags have become a dominant feature in the promotional products industry especially because there has been an increased awareness in the need for the sustainability of the environment. Most businesses have made the choice to use these bags during their promotional campaigns because the bags are environmentally friendly but also because they can be made in a stylish way and this makes them look good. There is always a definite boost in the image of a company that uses such products for their promotional campaign. But what are the different kinds of Eco-friendly bags that are available?
The first type of Eco-friendly bags are the reusable or recyclable ones that are made out of material that can be used over and over again without causing harm to the environment. The materials that are used to manufacture Eco-friendly bags are in most cases used from waste and people will most probably not need them. These materials can be put into good use by turning them into reusable bags that are Eco-friendly. These bags are made by using materials that are acquired after they have been taken through a process that makes them into a fabric that is reusable without creating any harm to Eco system. Such materials because will later disintegrate without any problem. The products actually look good and have great benefit to the environment.
The different types of environmentally friendly bags are evident in the classifications of materials that are used to manufacture the bags. Vinyl is the most commonly used material as far as reusable bags are concerned although there is also canvas, hemp, nylon, cotton and recycled plastic. There is also jute material, organic bags and paper carry bags. All these materials can be used for promotional purposes and they can be made in different colors and designed in ways that suit any company depending on how the company wants them to look.
Another major difference with regards to Eco-bags is the way that they are manufactured and especially how their styles are designed. Many of these bags will come in the tote style of and are made with short handles. The bag is usually square in shape and very much familiar to plastic or paper bags. Sometimes these bags can be made with handles that are long and are capable of accommodating lots of luggage with some having a bottom that is leveled out and can be used to carry luggage without difficulty. Generally, you will find very many different types of Eco-friendly bags.
Environmentally friendly bags are also available in an assortment of patterns, structures and colors that can allow a company to show their customers appreciation through gifting. They can also be used to send the theme message of the company thus enhancing the image of the company while at the same time taking the care to be environmentally friendly. Nonetheless, while there are many types of Eco-friendly bags, the canvas pack bag is one that is very popular because of its durability and the fact that it looks quite trendy. This is one environmentally friendly bag that is washable and can be used again and again. These bags are actually more practical and have many advantages when examined in contrast to many other types of Eco-friendly bags.

From Oscar de la Renta to Chanel, here are some of the most lavish and prestigious fashion brands. Subscribe to Hindered Thoughts http://goo.gl/d3U3RP 6. Chanel The high fashion wear company was introduced to the world back in 1909 by none other than Gabrielle Bonheur Chanel, otherwise known as “Coco Chanel.” This is where the brand gets its inspiration for the famously recognizable logo that is two interlocking C’s. The company specializes in creating haute couture for its wealthy clients but also for fashion models like Naomi Campbell, who once modeled for them, and actresses Marilyn Monroe, Keira Knightley, and Nicole Kidman. One of their most famous products is the perfume No. 5 de Chanel, along with the Chanel Suit. Today, Chanel is valued at being $6.8 billion dollars. An interesting fact to note is that Karl Lagerfeld, the creative director behind Fendi, happens to be the creative director for Chanel as well. 5. Prada Founded back in 1913 by Mario Prada, this fashion brand actually started out by manufacturing leather bags and trunks. It would then evolve into selling everything from clothing to perfume and even a brief stint of LG Prada cell phones. Though the brand may have broadened its inventory, it still spends the majority of its focus creating some of the world’s most exclusive handbags that only the rich and famous can possibly hope to afford. Mario Prada believed that women should not be involved in business so he excluded his own family members from getting involved. In a fantastic twist of irony, his son did not care to run the business so his daughter Luisa Prada took over as his successor and is now currently being run by her daughter Miuccia. 4. House of Versace The fashion empire that is the House of Versace all started with fashion designer Gianni Versace back in 1978. He created a brand that has been synonymous with elegance and simply oozes high fashion. His glamorous gowns have gone on to make a name for himself as a respected designer. Like the case of the famous black dress held with gold safety pins that actress Elizabeth Hurley wore back in 1994 to the premiere of Four Weddings and A Funeral. Sadly, Versace’s life was cut short in 1997 on the steps of his Miami mansion when he became the fifth and final victim of Andrew Cunanan. The tragic event will be the story behind American Crime Story’s season 2 titled: The Assassination of Gianni Versace. After his death, his sister Donatella became the new Artistic Director and has established a $5.5 billion company her brother would be proud of. 3. Gucci Started in 1921 by a Mr. Guccio Gucci, the company was originally dabbing in leather goods. It wasn’t until 19 years later when his son Aldo would take the company from being a one-stop shop into the fashion powerhouse that it’s now known for being. It’s Aldo that would usher in the era of the brand’s iconic “Bamboo Bag” and its “ready to wear segments.” In the 90’s, the company decided to bring American Fashion designer Tom Ford to revamp their women’s wear. He ended up helping launch the brand to where it is today. The fashion brand houses other well-known designers in its collections such as Alexander McQueen, Stella McCartney, and Yves Saint Laurent. If you’re in the market to do some shopping at this $12.4 billion brand, expect to spend at least $2,000. 2. Louis Vuitton This may come as a shock but the famous fashion brand has been around longer than you might have thought. Formed 163 years ago in 1854, a young man by the name of Louis Vuitton started out as an apprentice for a box-maker. Vuitton ended up becoming a well-known crafter of luxury trunks and opened up his own shop in Paris. He then ended up becoming the personal box-maker of Napoleon III’s wife, Empress Eugenie de Montijo. Fast forward years later and the company is now worth $28.1 billion with a generated revenue of $10.1 billion. Today, Louis Vuitton doesn’t make just trunks but designer handbags and clothing that can be spotted on the most famous of A-listers. 1. Balenciaga The beginning of Balenciaga’s reign began back in 1919 when it was established by its founder of the same name, Cristóbal Balenciaga. As a young child, Balenciaga became an apprentice to a tailor in his hometown of Getaria, Spain and would eventually get his formal training in Madrid. He would go on to create the House of Balenciaga and skyrocketed to success thanks to his artistic genius. He was hailed as the undisputed “ King of Fashion” and was highly respected among his peers which included the likes of Coco Chanel, Christian Dior, and Pierre Balmain. Balenciaga even helped train the likes of high-fashion designers Oscar de la Renta and Hubert Givenchy to name a few.

Hey guys, in today's video I wanted to share 5 brands/designers that really impacted the way I look at clothing.

Subscribe to the Refinery29 channel: http://bit.ly/subscribe-to-r29 “Couture” is a magic word. It conjures thoughts of impeccable craftsmanship, visionary design, and legendary fashion moments. But, most of us don't encounter haute couture very often, unless we're looking at a celebrity on the red carpet, a model on a catwalk, or a mannequin in a museum case. We wanted to get closer to couture — and to get you closer to couture — so we partnered with the legendary fashion publisher Visionaire to create this video, which tells the story of one dress from birth to runway. It’s a unique look inside the Dior atelier, where the team has been hard at work bringing creative director Raf Simons’ ideas to life. While an individual couture garment can take half a year to produce, here you will see the story of one dress (“Look #53,” in fashion-speak) come together in just a few minutes — from the first muslin pattern to the final style model Kinga Rajzak wore during yesterday’s haute couture show. It’s an incredible revelation, and when you discover what goes into these garments, the crazy prices on couture start to seem at least a little less crazy. While Look #53 is the star of the show, the video gives us the chance to reconnect with the rarely credited artisans and seamstresses we saw in Dior and I, as well as a cameo from Simons himself. Think of this as a mini-trip to Paris or a crash course into fashion’s highest form; either way, enjoy your couture, concentrated.

Do you ever wonder why fashion designers don't dress very well? I explain, from a fashion designer's perspective, why I don't dress fashionably. Ask me a question! Or leave a comment below to explain why you DO or DON'T dress fashionably! Article Version is here: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-fashion-designers-dont-dress-well-emily-m-keller?trk=pulse_spock-articles Designers are figuring out 1 piece of the puzzle, where stylists are dealing with the big picture puzzle. I’m like many other fashion designers. I don’t dress particularly well or fashionably. Those of you out there that already know fashion designers don’t dress well, you’re ahead of most. Give me a second and let me help the others catch up and understand that lots of designers don’t dress fashionably. It’s a classic case of “The cobbler’s son has no shoes”, “There are only wooden spoons at the blacksmith’s house”, “The lady who sells fans fans herself with her hands”, “At the potter’s house water is served in a broken jug”, “The carpenter’s house always needs work, “The architect’s house is always crooked.” Why People think we dress well: -Stylists’ Confusion – We didn’t go to school to style outfits. We didn’t learn how to coordinate colors with shapes on different body types. We went to school to learn how to develop designs and how to execute them. I learned absolutely nothing about styling in my 4 years at FIT because my major wasn’t styling. Why We Don’t: 1. Workaholism – successful designers are obsessed with their work, therefore they tend to neglect all other aspects of their life. And dressing yourself is a completely different animal from dressing other people. And if I know I’m going to make no money off of dressing myself, then I would rather spend my time designing my clothing line. Time is money. Although, I do feel like this is changing with social media and each individual’s ‘personal brand’ is becoming more important. 2. Clothing Exhaustion – I design clothes all day for my target customer. The last thing I want to do when I get home is look at my own clothes and think about what to wear. 3. A designer isn’t usually their customer - Many designers’ target customer isn’t normally a category that they themselves fit into. This can be why you don’t see designers running around in their own pieces. It can be awkward to wear your own clothes if you know you’re not the type of person you’re designing it for. 4. Dressing Yourself Is Hard – Just as it’s easier to judge others actions and life choices, it’s also easier to know what others should be wearing. It’s hard to realistically judge your own character and therefore it’s also hard to dress yourself. Honestly, my boyfriend has a ton of say in what I wear. He is basically my personal stylist because I can’t figure out how to dress myself. Although I do sometimes ignore his strong opinions. 5. Simplifying life – This is a big trend right now. With all the minimalist living ideas popping up. But there are plenty of people who had this concept in mind before it became cool. Having a daily simplified ‘uniform’ saves time in one’s busy schedule. Think about it: if your whole closet was white button downs, blue jeans, and black sneakers, you would save so much time in the morning. Boom. Especially if you knew you looked good and felt confident in that ‘uniform’. Remember those days when the minute you left your house you regretted what you put on? You would never have a day like this ever again! You could predictably exude confidence. It’s lowering your risk of looking like an idiot. 6. We’re too cool. We’re basically just too cool to dress fashionably. Maybe it’s a bit of an elitist mentality. Everyone knows that fashion wannabes put a lot of effort into what they wear. Who are fashion wannabes you ask? They’re all the other fashion industry professions except for designers. This includes but is not limited to: stylists, buyers, merchandisers, bloggers … At FIT, the merchandise majors dressed up for class: heels, makeup, the works. The designers didn’t. Our work load was notoriously larger, so we didn’t have the time to pamper ourselves. Plus we had more crap to carry. You can’t wear heels while carrying a suitcase full of paper, fabric, scissors, and humongous rulers, without looking like an idiot. Dressing comfortably started as a necessity in school and wound up being a key differentiation between us and them as we transitioned into the working world. Too cool for school should really be too cool since school.

Watch more Fashion Designers and Fashion Brands videos: http://www.howcast.com/videos/500176-Giorgio-Armani-Fashion-Designers Giorgio Armaniâ€™s one of the most prestigious brands in fashion. The brand produces lines all the way from Armani Prive as the couture level all the way down to Armani jeans. Giogio Armani is high end ready to wear and Collezioni is ready to wear slightly less expensive and Armani. Giorgio Armani himself was born outside of Milan in 1934. The company remains based in Milan. He studied medicine, but never really worked in medicine and instead found a job at (?) the most important fashion store in Italy in 1957 where he did visual merchandising and was a buyer for the store. And he caught the eye of a menâ€™s wear manufacturer, Nino Cerutti, who hired him to design a wholesale menâ€™s wear line called the Hitman where he stayed for eight years. An important milestone in Armaniâ€™s career was the 1980 film, American Gigolo in which Richard Gere had an Armani wardrobe that received almost as much attention as the film itself. It really put Armani on the map and made him into a household name. Concurrent with the film, Armaniâ€™s designs were featured in boutiques like Barneyâ€™s and also high end department stores like Sakâ€™s. So, people that had loved Richard Gears clothes in the film could go and buy Armani clothes themselves. In fact, Armani opened an office in Los Angeles to be closer to Hollywood clients. His suits in particular were really favored by men and women in the creative industries. The distinguishing feature of Armani clothes and Armani suits in particular is that itâ€™s a relaxed tailoring. He actually figured out different ways of doing things. He took away a lot of the under structure of menâ€™s tailoring to make the suits softer, make them more body conscious. Characters on the 1980s TV series, Miami Vice also wore a lot of Armani. Armani jeans flourished as part of the whole designer jean culture and fragrances and eye wear were introduced. Both of which have been very important to the brand. Giorgio Armani has also done many other things including design soccer uniforms and flight attendants uniforms for Alitalia. What distinguishes Giorgio Armaniâ€™s designs in addition to their relaxed tailoring is a unique color palette. He uses a lot of really interesting neutrals kind of mushroomy grays and navy blues that are so dark theyâ€™re almost black. Never anything harsh, but always very subtle and kind of mysterious colors. People say that once you wear Armani everything else seems uncomfortable.

The homeowner’s love for fashion is found throughout the space with sleek black and white decor, lush fabrics and chic accessories. The kitchen features a Calacatta marble slab backsplash and large island, which is perfect for preparing food and hosting family gatherings. Walls are outfitted with abstract works of art, while unexpected pieces like a velvet blue couch and a shag rug add interest and texture to the space. Touches of chrome act as large-scale pieces of jewelry, highlighting the high-fashion feel throughout.
Here is a rundown of Streetwear Brands to look out for in 2018. These are, in my opinion, some of the best Men’s clothing brands to keep an eye out for. If you are a hypebeast and only know about Supreme, then maybe this video will inform you that there are more brands out there haha.

Editor's note: "The living (sajiva, in Sanskrit) seek food, the lifeless (ajiva) and the dead (nirjiva) don’t. This makes food the fundamental target (laksh) of life. From laksh comes Lakshmi. Lakshmi is food (anna) in nature and wealth (dhana) in culture," writes Devdutt Pattanaik in his book 7 Secrets of the Goddess (published by Westland). As the goddess associated with the perhaps the biggest Indian festival — Diwali — this seems a timely moment to deepen our understanding of Lakshmi, and all that she represents. The following excerpt from 7 Secrets of the Goddess has been republished here with permission from the author, and Westland.
In the Puranas, Lakshmi has three fathers: Varuna, Puloman and Bhrigu. Varuna is an asura in the Vedas, but in the Puranas he becomes a deva, a god of the sea, source of all water. The Puranas describe Puloman as the asura-king and Bhrigu as the asura-guru. This makes Lakshmi the daughter of asuras. The word ‘asura’ has been given a moral turn in recent times; they are visualised in children’s books as dark-skinned, fat, horned, ugly — the embodiment of evil. It is easy then to assume that Lakshmi’s association with asuras stems from the fear of materialism and the corrupting influence of wealth. But equating asuras with evil, and by extension devas with good, is more a convenient translation than a correct one, the result of a Judeo-Christian-Islamic lens that came to India first via Mughal rulers, and then the British.
In the Puranas, devas and asuras are both children of Brahma. Devas live in the sky and asuras below the earth. All wealth exists below the earth, for it is below the earth that seeds sprout, metal is created and water is hidden. To pull this wealth out, we need the sun (Surya), the wind (Vayu), fire (Agni) and rain (Indra); in other words, we need devas, who then become ‘gods’, as their actions favour humanity. Asuras become ‘demons’ as they resist sharing Lakshmi with humanity.
Varuna, as god of the sea, gives its wealth of salt and fish and pearls freely, without asking anything in return. That is why perhaps Varuna is not asura, but deva. Varuna is also the symbol of generosity: one is who is truly affluent. Puloman rules the land below the earth and does not release Lakshmi easily. Humanity has to invent complex agricultural and mining processes to procure wealth from the earth. The wealth obtained is called Pulomi (which means daughter of Puloman), another name for Lakshmi.
Bhrigu, guru of the asuras, is associated with prediction and foresight. His son Shukra is associated with creativity. A man who can predict the future, who has foresight and is creative, is more likely to create wealth. That is why Lakshmi is called Bhargavi, daughter of Bhrigu. That makes her Shukra’s sister. Lakshmi’s value comes only when she leaves her father’s realm, when she is no longer immersed in water or buried under the earth. The creation of wealth then is a violent process: forests have to be destroyed to make way for fields and human settlements. Raw materials have to be pulled out of the ground for industries. In other words, ‘asuras’ have to be killed to obtain Lakshmi. She dazzles only when she leaves her father’s realm and is seen seated beside Indra, god of the sky, bringer of rain, lord of Amravati.
Wealth that belongs to humans, which has been acquired from nature, is best represented by the pot. The pot is a human invention that allows people to own water and carry it wherever they go. It is the symbol of cultural intervention, of industry and market, creating value out of natural resources. Water in the forest is available for all animals; but water in a pot belongs to the owner of the pot and whosoever he or she gives it to. The pot that is Lakshmi belongs to Indra, and has been wrenched away from the asuras.
The asuras who are killed by devas are time and again resurrected by Shukra, who has the secret known as Sanjivanividya, which brings the dead back to life. This alludes to the fertility of the earth which brings back crops year after year. The act of harvesting the crops is equated with the killing of the asuras by devas, an act of violence that enables Lakshmi to come into the house of the farmer. Thus harvest festivals of India, be it vasant-navaratri (Goddess worship in spring) or sharad-navaratri (Goddess worship in autumn), marking the winter and summer agricultural cycles of India, are invariably associated with the killing of asuras: for example, Durga kills Mahisha-asura in Dussehra and Krishna kills Naraka-asura in Diwali. That is why the battle between devas and asuras is cyclical. It will never end as long as humans depend on harvesting nature’s bounty and seek the regeneration of nature’s fertility.
As Indra’s wife, Lakshmi is known as Sachi and Indra is known as Sachin. The arrival of Lakshmi turns Amravati into Swarga, or paradise. For she brings with her Kalpataru, the wish-fulfilling tree; Kama-dhenu, the wish-fulfilling cow; Chinta-mani, the wish-fulfilling jewel; the Akshaya-patra, the cornucopia, the pot that is always overflowing with grain and gold. These treasures enable the devas to live a life of luxury. They do not have to work a single day. They simply have to make a wish and their desires come true. It is an enviable lifestyle.
What is never clarified in the Puranas is why Indra is entitled to all the pleasures that Lakshmi has to offer. It is simply assumed that wealth belongs to the devas. No explanation is offered. Modern retellings often equate asuras with the ‘original’ forest-dwellers who were displaced by deva ‘migrants’ who came with superior agricultural and pastoral technology. This is how the eternal battle between asuras and devas is explained sociologically. Marxist anthropologists equate devas as the ‘haves’ and the asuras as the ‘have-nots’. Traditionalists tend to describe devas as ‘good’ and thus entitled to Lakshmi, but this does not make any sense as Indra in the Puranas is always shown drunk on soma-rasa, immersed in sensory pleasures offered by apsaras, often being indifferent, even rude, to sages.
From the asura point of view, Indra is a thief. But unless the devas ‘steal’ Lakshmi out of the subterranean realm, Lakshmi cannot have value. The asuras do not see it this way. They simply want their daughter/sister back. So they lay siege to Amravati and constantly fight the devas. This turns paradise into an eternal battleground, or rana-bhoomi, with devas constantly struggling to hold on to their wealth. Indra thus has prosperity but no peace. This naturally makes asuras, source of Indra’s great displeasure, the villains of the Puranas.
We can equate Indra and the devas with ‘wealth-generators’ and ‘value-creators’ who are often at the receiving end of criticism because the process of generating wealth is invariably violent: ecosystems are destroyed and people are compelled to work so that industries and markets can thrive. Wealth generation also creates social divides on economic lines, for those who establish industries and markets (devas?) feel entitled to claim the lion’s share of the wealth generated, much more than those who actually work in industries and markets (asuras?) who end up feeling deprived and often exploited.
The devas can also be inheritors who have not earned anything but have the benefit of enjoying vast wealth because they were born in a particular family. Indra is unable to see the unfairness of the situation because he is born into privilege. He is unable to see the rage of the asuras. Each demonises the other. Neither understands the other.
The conflict between devas and asuras is very much like the conflict between capitalists and socialists. For the devas, the battle is between those who create wealth and those who do not create wealth. For the asuras, the battle is between those who steal wealth and those who do not steal wealth. What is ‘wealth creation’ for one group is ‘wealth-theft’ for another group. Neither can agree about who should get the lion’s share of the wealth generated. Each one is therefore convinced the other is wrong, resulting in a relentless ‘righteous’ battle.
While Indra may be happy with Lakshmi by his side, Lakshmi never seems happy to be beside Indra. She seems restless, always on the lookout for someone worthier.
Lakshmi is sometimes visualised seated next to Kubera, the rich king of the yakshas, who hoards treasure. Kubera is identified as Indra’s treasurer in some texts, but other texts identify Kubera’s wife as Nidhi, goddess of treasures, another name for Lakshmi. Sachi is often described as being more faithful to Indra’s throne than to Indra the person, for Indra can be easily replaced by one more worthy. Indra is always insecure, never able to enjoy his vast wealth. His throne is always shaky, threatened by rishis, rajas and asuras. This is also why Lakshmi is called chanchala or whimsical, even cock-eyed (Lokhi-tera, in Bengali). No one is ever sure who the goddess of wealth and fortune will favour. She can appear suddenly without reason, and leave without warning.
Indra gets nervous when a rishi performs tapasya and seeks to generate tapa, the mental fire that will grant siddhi, powers that will enable the rishi to control devas. So he sends apsaras to seduce the rishis and disrupt their tapasya. He steals horses and disrupts the yagnas of rajas so that they are not a threat to his power. And he constantly runs to his father Brahma seeking help to kill asuras who lay siege to his paradise. He knows that he is king because of Lakshmi, and his kingdom is Swarga because of Lakshmi. This narrative reflects the insecurity that comes with wealth. The rich are never secure about their possessions; they constantly feel that people around them wish to steal what is theirs. This state of mind is the rana-bhoomi, the eternal battle that consumes Indra’s paradise.
The story goes that once Lakshmi left Indra’s side and went to the asura-king Prahalad. Brahma advised Indra to disguise himself as a servant and serve Prahalad diligently to find out why Lakshmi favoured him over Indra. Indra did as advised and Prahalad finally revealed his secret, ‘Lakshmi is attracted to men of action, who demonstrate strength and smartness. If you display strength and shrewdness, she will come to you. If you fail to do that, she will not stay with you for long.’ Later, when Prahalad offered the disguised Indra a boon, Indra very shrewdly asked for all of Prahlad's merits. Prahalad, bound by his word, gave his merits away. As soon as merit moved from Prahalad to Indra, Lakshmi also moved from Prahalad’s side to Indra’s side.
In the Ramayana, Ravana, king of the rakhasas, has physical power or strength. He has 20 arms and 10 heads. With brute force, he overpowers his brother Kubera and drives him out of the golden island-city of Lanka. He lays claim to Kubera's kingdom and throne. He also abducts the wife of Ram, prince of Ayodhya. Thus Lakshmi comes to Ravana by force.
In the Mahabharata, Duryodhana, eldest of the Kauravas, is shrewd and guileful. He uses cunning to defeat his cousins, the five Pandavas, who are much stronger than him and who he feels are rivals to the throne of Hastinapur (which he is convinced is his birthright). First, Duryodhana tries to get rid of the Pandavas by gifting them a palace of lac, which he sets afire while they are asleep. Unfortunately, this plan fails. Later he invites the Pandavas to a gambling match and defeats them by getting his uncle, Shakuni, master of the dice, to play on his behalf. In exchange for their freedom, Pandavas have to forfeit rights over their land for 13 years. Thus Lakshmi comes to the Kauravas by guile.
But Lakshmi acquired through strength or guile can never be retained. Someone who is stronger or more shrewd always comes along and claims our Lakshmi. Thus Ravana meets his match in Ram, the prince of Ayodhya, who defeats him in battle. And Duryodhana finds his match in Krishna, the wily charioteer, who helps the Pandavas outsmart the cunning Kauravas. Indra is never able to keep Lakshmi by his side for as long as there is always a stronger or smarter asura who comes along.
In the early part of the Vedas indicated by Brahmana texts, we find hymns and rituals about acquiring and celebrating wealth that take the form of cows, horses, grain, gold, children. Wealth is seen as ushering in happiness. In the latter part of the Vedas indicated by the Aranyaka and Upanishad texts, we find a great discomfort with wealth. Wealth is seen as something that also brings with it a great deal of unhappiness: the envy of neighbours, loss of friends, quarrels within family. This shift in thought between early and later Vedic periods on the nature of wealth is reflected in how Indra is positioned. Indra is the great warrior king of the Vedas, but in the Puranas, he is insecure and helpless, constantly seeking the help of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.
Giving up wealth simply because its arrival can cause unhappiness is not the answer. What is, then? This inquiry leads us to Vedanta, which explores the relationship between mind and property. Vedanta means philosophy that was milked out of the Vedas. It was communicated to the common man through the stories of the Puranas.
In the Puranas, we learn of Lakshmi’s elder sister, Jyestha, also known as Alakshmi, who always accompanies her. She is the goddess of strife. She is the reason why the prosperity of Lakshmi is never accompanied by peace. The only way to get peace into the household is to discover and invoke either Shiva or Vishnu. When Lakshmi accompanies Shiva or Vishnu, then Alakshmi does not accompany Lakshmi, and so wealth is not accompanied by quarrels.
Indra is so focused on Lakshmi, or rather Sachi, his wife, that he is indifferent to Alakshmi. He takes no steps to protect himself from the envy and rage of those around him. Naturally, fortune and happiness are short-lived. Eventually, inevitably, while he is busy with his wine and women and other excesses, his enemies lay siege to Swarga and declare war.
One day, Lakshmi leaves Swarga in a huff when Indra insults her: in a drunken state, he throws a garland of lotus flowers gifted to him to the ground, allowing it to be trampled by elephants. This disrespect shown to wealth and affluence is something Lakshmi does not like, so she dissolves herself in the ocean of milk. With the disappearance of Lakshmi, the world becomes gloomy, and Indra’s paradise loses its affluence. The wish-fulfilling cow stops giving milk, the wish-fulfilling tree stops bearing fruit, the wish-fulfilling gem loses its shine, and the wish-fulfilling pot becomes empty. The only way to get Lakshmi back to Swarga is by churning her out from the ocean of milk. So Indra goes to his father Brahma for help, and Brahma directs him to Vishnu.
Vishnu advises that Indra first make friends with the asuras, as a counter-force is required to churn the ocean. He then forms the churning tool by using Meru, the king of mountains, as a spindle, and Vasuki, the king of serpents, as a rope. Akupara, the king of turtles, a form of Vishnu himself, keeps this aloft. The churning begins with the devas holding the tail-end of Vasuki and the asuras holding the neck-end. When the devas pull, the asuras let go. When the asuras pull, the devas let go.
The churning goes on for eons. And finally from the waters arises Lakshmi, along with all the treasures of paradise. Along with her come Kalpataru, Kamadhenu, Chintamani and Akshaya-patra, symbols of wealth. Also with her are the elephant Airavata and the flying horse Ucchaishrava, both white as milk, symbols of royal power. Also with her is Rambha, the most beautiful damsel, who is well-versed in all forms of pleasure, and Soma, the moon-god, the most handsome and romantic of men.
Lakshmi also brings with her a pot of amrita, the nectar of immortality. This is sought by everyone, but Vishnu tricks the asuras and ensures only the devas get to drink the amrita. The devas, rendered immortal, then rise to their heaven with Lakshmi and everything that brings prosperity, power and pleasure. But there is one change. Lakshmi herself chooses to go to Vishnu. She is drawn to him. This is significant: it establishes Vishnu as superior to Indra. Indra may have defeated the asuras, but it is Vishnu who enabled the victory. And even though Vishnu enabled the victory, he does not claim the much sought after amrita.
They may seem similar, but there is a vast difference between Indra and Vishnu. This difference is not about form, but thought. Indra’s name alludes to ‘indriyas’, or sense organs.
Indra symbolises the mind that enjoys pleasure, hoards wealth, and feels constantly threatened by others. He only wants to satisfy his needs and wants. By contrast, Vishnu is concerned about the needs and wants of others. Like Shiva, Vishnu wants to outgrow the world; but his method is different. While Shiva withdraws from society to outgrow his hunger, Vishnu engages with society to outgrow his hunger. He strives hard to help humans discover their dharma.
Dharma means potential. Every creature has to do what they are supposed to do, what they are capable of. It is the dharma of fire to burn, of water to flow, of trees to grow and bear fruit, of animals to run towards food and mates and away from predators. But what is human potential? Is it to create/hoard/distribute wealth to satisfy one’s own hunger like Indra, or is it to outgrow hunger like Shiva? Humans are not clear about what path to take. That is why we need Vishnu.
Vishnu balances the shortcomings of Brahma’s sons such as Indra with the possibility offered by Shiva. He knows that humans have the capacity to satisfy their own hunger as well as the hunger of others. They also have the capacity to outgrow — and enable others to outgrow — their own hunger. He works towards enabling people to become aware of this capacity, help themselves by helping others. And he does this in the most counter-intuitive of ways.
Superficially, it seems as though Vishnu favours devas over asuras. But a closer observation reveals it is not as simple as it looks. He is granting devas immortality. Why then is Indra still craving for Lakshmi? Should he not be happy as he no longer has to fear death and hence has no real need for Lakshmi? Should he not be content? But he is not: the hunger for Lakshmi continues. And ironically, Lakshmi, grabbed from the asuras, rejects the devas, and follows Vishnu. Vishnu has that which no one else has. Yes, Vishnu is stronger than anyone else. Like Shiva, Vishnu also knows that food does not satisfy hunger. It only amplifies hunger. One can never satiate human needs and wants. His focus on thoughts rather than things is what makes Vishnu attractive to Lakshmi.
Lakshmi has two forms: Bhu-devi and Sri-devi. Bhu-devi is the earth-goddess and embodies tangible wealth like food. Sri-devi is associated with intangible wealth or glamour. One can say Bhu-devi is natural wealth and Sri-devi is cultural wealth. In south Indian temples these two forms of Lakshmi are seen beside images of Vishnu.
In the Puranas, Bhu-devi is often visualised as a cow. The story goes that a king called Vena plundered the earth so much that the rishis had to intervene and kill this greedy king. They churned his corpse and from the purified remains created a new king, Prithu. Prithu was a form of Vishnu. He discovered that the earth had run away in the form of a cow, so he pursued her with his bow and arrow, threatening to strike her if she did not stop and allow his subjects to milk her. ‘If you kill me, the world will cease to exist,’ she cried. ‘But if you cannot be milked, the world cannot survive,’ argued Prithu. So finally, assured that he would protect her and not let anyone plunder her, Bhu-devi let herself be milked by all living creatures under the watchful eye of Prithu.
As Prithu, Vishnu declared that the kings of the earth would be guardians of Bhu-devi, and that he himself would descend on earth if she was troubled. He becomes the Go-pala, or caretaker of the earth-cow, Go-mata.
In the Bhagavata Purana, Bhu-devi comes weeping to Vishnu and complains about the weight of greedy kings that she
has to bear and begs him to relieve her burden. And so Vishnu descends as Parashuram, Ram and Krishna to kill all the greedy kings of the world. Thus the avatars of Vishnu are meant to secure Lakshmi. She is under Vishnu’s protection.
In the stories of his mortal avatars — Parashuram, Ram and Krishna — Vishnu never claims ownership of Lakshmi, even in situations when he is ‘entitled’ to her.
In Krishna’s story, the Goddess takes many forms. She is Radha to Krishna before his marriage; she loves him even though she belongs to another, thus defying all cultural norms. She is Rukmini who defies her father and elopes with him to Dwarka. She is Satyabhama who obeys her father and marries him, but constantly reminds him that it is her wealth, not his intelligence alone, that makes him an influential member of the Yadava clan.
Finally, the Goddess takes the form of Draupadi, who is helpless and abused despite having five husbands to protect her. Her husbands, the Pandavas, are described as Indras reborn. She needs Vishnu to help her and he does so, as Krishna, even though he is not obliged to do so by any social law or custom. He does so out of love.
Unlike Indra, who only sees Lakshmi as pleasure, Vishnu sees Lakshmi as his responsibility. Vishnu seeks to create an ecosystem where Lakshmi is not held captive; instead she is distributed and celebrated by all.
As Hinduism made its journey from Vedic ritualism to Puranic devotion, it became increasingly monastic. This meant that the yogi, one who does not care for wealth, was given more respect in society than a bhogi, one who enjoys wealth. In such a society, Lakshmi was seen as the source of all problems. Rather than taking responsibility for their own inadequacies, human society blamed Lakshmi for the conflicts of society.
This tension between the yogi and the bhogi is a constant theme in the Puranas. The yogi Shiva is turned into the bhogi Shankara when he marries Parvati. The bhogi Indra learns from the yogi Vishnu how to transform rana-bhoomi or battleground into ranga-bhoomi or playground. Similar tensions can be seen in temple lore, where the language is regional, and the themes more practical.
The following is an Odiya story which is part of the temple lore of Puri Jagannath temple where Krishna Jagannath is worshipped along with his brother Balabhadra and his sister Subhadra:
One day, Balabhadra sees Lakshmi entering the house of a sweeper woman. He declares that she has been contaminated and orders his younger brother not to let her into the house. Krishna obeys and shuts the door of the temple. In the days that follow, to the great alarm of the divine siblings, no food is offered to them. On enquiry, they discover there is no food being cooked in the kitchen as all vegetables and fruits and cereals and pulses and spices have disappeared from the pantry and the market. There is not even a drop of water to drink. The siblings trace this catastrophe to their rejection of Lakshmi. Eventually Krishna apologises to his wife and begs her to return to the temple.
In this story, Krishna’s ascetic brother, the yogi Balabhadra, learns that notions of contamination and pollution make no sense to the goddess of wealth. These are artificial cultural norms created by humans to satisfy their craving for hierarchy. Food will satisfy without discrimination the hunger of all, be it a sweeper, a king or a god. In other words, food is satya, truth independent of human opinion. Notions of contamination, which is the hallmark of the caste system, is mithya, dependent on human opinion. When we discover that Lakshmi does not discriminate between saint and thief, that all hierarchies are man-made creations, then Lakshmi becomes a tool for liberation.
The following is a Telugu tale from one of the richest temples of India — the Tirupati Balaji temple that enshrines Vishnu on earth:
The sage Bhrigu, a yogi, decided to pay a visit to Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu. He found Brahma too busy conducting a yagna with Saraswati to pay him attention, so he cursed Brahma that he would not be worshipped at all. He found Shiva too busy being intimate with Shakti to pay him attention. This time, his anger wasn't as fiery, so he said Shiva would be worshipped, but only as an abstract symbol, the linga.
He then moved to the ocean of milk, to Vaikuntha, convinced that Vishnu would surely pay him attention. But there he found Vishnu sleeping, his feet being massaged by Lakshmi. Furious that he mattered to none in the trinity, Bhrigu kicked Vishnu on his chest, where is located Srivatsa, the symbol of Lakshmi.
Vishnu did not get upset; he understood Bhrigu’s frustration and apologised to the sage, and checked if Bhrigu had hurt his foot while kicking his chest. Watching Vishnu touch his feet, Bhrigu was happy. Then realisation dawned as to how foolish he was being: though he claimed to be a yogi, his attention-seeking behaviour revealed he was actually a bhogi.
Lakshmi did not appreciate Vishnu’s servility, whatever his reason. She was furious that Vishnu did not punish the sage for insulting the Srivatsa. She walked out of Vaikuntha in a huff and went down to earth. Vishnu followed her, desperate to bring her back, for Vaikuntha cannot remain Vaikuntha without Lakshmi.
He decided to stay on earth until Lakshmi agreed to return. But he found no house; devotees would give him shelter until someone richer or more powerful came along. Finally, he saw the seven hills that reminded him of the seven hoods of his serpent Sesha on whose coils he reclined on the ocean of milk. This was Tirumala, the sacred hill. Homesick, he wished to settle here, but for that he had to marry the local princess Padmavati, born of a lotus flower. Her father, the local king, demanded a huge bridal price. Without Lakshmi by his side, Vishnu was the impoverished Daridra Narayana, and so he had no choice but to take a huge loan from Kubera. This narrative demonstrates the value of wealth in society; even Vishnu needs wealth to get himself a wife and home on earth. One who rejects Lakshmi cannot expect to have a home or a spouse.
News of Vishnu’s marriage to Padmavati upset Lakshmi who came to the wedding and demanded her place in Vishnu’s chest. So Vishnu expanded his chest to accommodate his two wives. He placed the celestial Lakshmi (Sri-devi) on the left side of his chest, near his heart, and the terrestrial Padmavati (Bhu-devi) on the right.
This Vishnu at Tirumala is trapped and needs the help of his devotees to repay his debt, so that he can return to Vaikuntha. He is called Venkat, he who can destroy (kata) bondage (vem), for in exchange of the wealth received, he grants his devotees the wisdom of yoga that explains the relationship one should have with wealth in order to be truly happy. This is further demonstrated in the ritual of giving wealth to transform Daridra-Narayana (the poor Vishnu) into Lakshmi-Narayana (the rich Vishnu): when Lakshmi is used to enable others to repay their debts, Vaikuntha is established and Lakshmi becomes a tool for liberation.

This summer I had the enormous pleasure and privilege to find myself stateside in attendance of several Charlotte Mason retreats, with some shopping and visits on the side. How kind and longsuffering my husband is to have taken care of things back home in Peru so I could have a couple of weeks of ‘mommy break’ as he calls it!
Among the interesting gems I have laid hold of this summer are: the importance of the manual hand work of Sloyd in early education; the place and importance of Mathematics, as well as it’s proper instruction; and how to take Science out of the box even in the upper years, getting the student to ask the questions. And perhaps outstanding amongst the others, the idea of being fully present and living fully wherever one is, struck home once again.
P.S. My arm may be twisted to blog about and/or link to those interesting gems... I will try and see what I can do. :)
How wonderful that you were able to go and be blessed. I am looking forward to hearing more about from other fellow homeschoolers. Maybe one day, I might be able to go to one of these retreats, OR hold one where I am in our accommodation. I don't know, but my Lord Jesus knows. :)
Look at all those beautiful smiles, breathtaking scenery, comfy spots, robust coffee, and a twin-sandwich to boot! Well, Amy, for better or for worse, we are friends and I.am.blessed.
:) i will do my best. it all depends on how well i'm able to keep real life in balance! as long as my husband doesn't throw me for too many crazy loops (we live an exciting life, ya know?!); i am determined to make it work! ;)

OK so you’ve just caught your first Salmon from the Kelvin, It’s a big beast of a thing still alive and thrashing in your landing net. The fisherman in us all will instinctively fumble about looking for that homemade priest and wonder have I got a bin bag big enough for this Leviathan……STOP for a minute and think!
What have I got in my net here? Is it a Cock, a Hen or a Kelt? If you’re unsure then this wee guide might help you identify your catch and make an informed decision as to whether you should really kill this fish:
Fresh Salmon - Recognised by the pristine condition and bright silver flanks. Fish straight from salt water have loose, easily detached scales and many carry sea lice which drop off within a few days. Hen salmon (illustrated) have a tiny kype on the lower jaw but unlike cocks they retain normal head proportions while in the river
Kelt - Kelts are salmon which have spawned. Usually identified by the thin shape, distended vent and presence of "gill maggots" on the red gill filaments, they are often encountered by anglers in spring when they regain a silvery appearance and can be mistaken for fresh run Springers. Kelts must bereturned unharmed to the water.
Cock - The combination of "tartan" colours is typical although shades vary - the fully developed kype, used in fighting rivals, and the enlarged adipose fin, are the most consistent indicators of maturity.
The combination of ‘tartan’ colours is typical although shades vary the fully developed kype, used in fighting rivals is the most consistent indicator of maturity.
This is a summer fish – springers are often darker by spawning timewhile late entrants may still be silver flanked. Fully mature hens have soft, swollen bellies and spawning is imminent if they also have protruding vents.
It is illegal to take unclean or unseasonable fish (anything but a fresh salmon – see pictures above)
It is illegal to kill anything apart from fresh salmon – this is why you are not allowed to fish off bridges – how can you net safely or return an unclean fish – an unclean fish should be netted and returned safely to the water with a minimal amount of fuss.

Surfing through the 50 or so blogs I track at Bloglines, I recently viewed an entertaining four-minute video. Besides being funny, watching it is roughly analogous to an archeologist realizing that the cuneiform text he’s struggling to translate makes perfect sense on the assumption that it’s reporting the chemical properties of the last nine elements of the actinide series (elements 95 through 103), including the Hittite equivalent transliteration of their names: americium, curium, berkelium, californium, einsteinium, fermium, mendelevium, nobelium, and lawrencium.
But, this video has nothing to do with Hittite cuneiform or the actinide series from the periodic table of elements. As the title to this blog indicates, the video has to do with man hugs. To be precise, the title is “How to Give A Great Man to Man Hug.”
The video edifies on two levels. First of all, it is funny. It is cast well, and the actors are flamboyantly hammy. Among the fun parts is a demonstration of what happens when a man-to-man hug is incompetently executed, resulting in a bashing together of foreheads and noses:
So, without further ado, be thou entertained by clicking the link below. After your entertainment, come back here, and I’ll set you to looking for the second way this video is edifying.
For those of you who are used to seeing a video player embedded in other blogs and wonder why I didn’t do it here, it’s because WordPress does not permit this feature at their site for security reasons.
Now, the video edifies for another reason, because it inspires this question: Why is the subject of this video funny? I think I’ll leave it at that for a few days to see what others suggest.
Inaccurate answers will be “hammy acting” or “slapstick humor.” Yes, the video has both, and they contribute to the humor. But, that’s not what I’m asking about. Beyond the humorous elements (slapstick, hammy acting), the subject itself and how it is expounded in the video make us ask “Why is this funny?”

It is funny because Western culture is oversexed and completely overtaken by rampant homosexuality. Ancient Christian men would greet one another with a kiss, because homosexuality was not conceivable. Ancient Christians who read of John reclining on Christ’s chest, would not have introduced homosexual connotations. As soon as the subject of affection is presented as “getting in touch with one’s feminine side” it becomes uncomfortable and unnatural, because any display thus becomes sexual. Men do not have a feminine side. That is why they are men. We leave the feminine for the experts–women. When emotion is equated or related to sexuality, it is limited by definition to the object of the sex drive. I guess what I am saying is the key to reestablishing true male emotional interaction is to emphasize masculinity and, thus, remove all doubt of intent.
It is funny, but true, that anything goes in a sports victory. This is because all sexual connotations are removed. The 300 pound linebaker can even smack the butt of his comrade without being suspected of anything perverse because the emotional moment, the context, is entirely masculine.
Well, here’s why I think it’s funny. It has elements of truth, contradiction, and exaggeration, like all effective humor.
The truth is the awkwardness of men in modern Western cultures physically expressing their affection for another man in all but the most restricted situations because of anxiety that they not be misunderstood due to the overtness of some men in demonstrating perverted affection (fallen Glory of God), or the “feminine side” nonsense.
The humor is: Instruction and guidance are needed, because what should be unremarkable (men expressing shared joy through physical means) might be interpreted as evidence of more than simply that.
You know what is really funny? It isn’t actually “masculine men” who need the instruction, but the people who refuse to acknowledge that men and women are different. The video is a message to them: “When you see men doing this they are not expressing homosexual attraction or their ‘feminine side.’ They are masculine men sharing a masculine joy with another masculine man.”

Oxalic-acid centered products, often found in “deck brighteners,” take away grayed surface area fibers from wood plus the darkish tannin stains which can happen on redwood and cedar decks.
A safer and lasting repair is to pull the popped nail in the board using the claw end of a hammer then exchange it using a deck screw that's a bit longer and wider in diameter when compared to the nail was.
Before making any repairs towards the deck, take out Grime and wood fibers with a pressure washer. When making use of a single, be sure you retain the pressure stream moving. Usually, you could gouge the wood. Allow the deck to dry overnight.
Dampness encourages surface area mildew and causes stains, particularly in damp or humid climates where surfaces never totally dry. And all-natural extractives in redwood and cedar can discolor the area.

Pozdravlenia! That is how you say congratulations in Russian. Ilnur Zakarin won a tough stage today after dispatching the Columbian rider Panano and polka do jersey wearer Rafael Maijka. The gradients in the final 2km of todays race were absolutely brutal and Zakarin found the legs to unload two very capable athletes.
BBehind in the yellow jersey group the Astana boys set a furious pace trying to put Chriis Froome into difficulty. As ever, Froomes loyal lieutenants kept hiim in the thick of the action. Froome had a view moments of appearing to be on the ropes but in the end he managed to make the final acceleration with Richie Porte with BMC and distance Fabio Aru, Nairo Quintana and Bauke Mollema.
Adam Yates with Orica/Bike Exchange managed to stay in the 2nd group after Mollemna had been dropped and he will go back into 2nd place on the GC. Quintana and Tejay Vangarderen were dropped and both lost time to Chris Froome.
Tomorrow brings an uphill time trial. The riders will tackle a 17km race that goes uphill right out of the start house. It ascends all the way to the final 2km and then is a downhill finish. The riders will most likely dispense with the time trial bikes and opt for road bikes with mini aero extensions and go with the lightest setup possible.
My prediction is that Froome will win this race. Other riders we can look to for a good ride are Richie Porte, Adam Yates and potentially Bauke Mollema.

Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path. Proverbs 3:5-6
Happy Saturday friends. It's pretty dreary here in NE PA. We are in line for that nasty storm that's coming...Sandy is going to drown us. 3-8 inches of rain tomorrow and it's supposed to rain until Wednesday. We're in for it. They are expecting over 1 million people to be without power, so if you don't hear from me for a couple of days, I'm OK, just no power.
So, on to today's card. I am using the cute Flying Panda for my card this week. Sometimes we all have a friend whose pet is like a child to them. And when that pet dies, it's heartbreaking for them. I decided to make a Pet Sympathy card with this little Panda. He's a flying angel panda and I thought he would make a good sympathy card for some one's pet.
To make this card, I used a marbled light blue card stock for the base. I then cut a piece of blue heart DP as my background. I used two pieces of chocolate card stock and a deep teal piece. These are cut to fit into a type of mosaic pattern. I used the same marbled blue card stock for the mat for the focal image. I used my Nestabilities Classic Scalloped Circle for that. I stamped the panda with Memento Tuxedo Black and used two different Sakura Glitter pens to color him in..Dark Blue and Gold for the halo. I don't think he needs any more coloring than that. I cut him out with Nestabilities. I used pop dots to attach the panda. The flower is made from a light blue five petal flower and a brown five petal flower. I used a large circle brad to keep them together and used Stickles to give it sparkle. I hand wrote the sentiment in White Gel pen.
So there you have it. A cute little pet sympathy card. Join us next Saturday for another new set of images from Queen Kat Designs. Have a wonderful day and God bless.
Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart. Commit your ways unto Him and He shall bring it to pass
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
First off, I am a Christian. Blood bought, spirit filled child of the Most High God. I am a SAH, homeschool mom who has been married for 14 years to my wonderful hubby, Tim. We have one beautiful daughter, Kierstynne. I am a crafter, daughter, grand daughter, sister, friend, teacher, student, aunt, and can do anything because I am woman.
But God, being rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our sin, made us alive together with Christ, by grace you have been saved.
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways, declares the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways and My thoughts than yours.
So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth. It will not return to Me empty without accomplishing what I desire, and without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.
If God answers your prayers, God is God and He is good. If He doesn't answer your prayers, God is still God and He is still good.

Residents of Narail are ecstatic over National cricketer Mashrafee Bin Mortaza's decision to contest the polls on an Awami League (AL) ticket in the national elections slated for Dec 23.
AL leaders and the youth see this move as a positive one, as Mashrafee becoming a member of the parliament will mean developments in the otherwise neglected southwestern district.
“He has expressed interest and will buy a nomination form from AL chief’s Dhanmondi office on Nov 11 (Sunday),” AL’s Deputy Office Secretary Biplob Barua told the media.
Since the announcement, Mashrafee has been the talk of the town not only in Narail but also in various political circles.

Hummus is an Arabian food which used to serve as sauce. Most famous Arabian dish is made by chickpeas or gram. The best part is, hummus is extremely easy to prepare and doesn’t require any special, hard-to-find ingredients. It’ll only take you a few minutes to make this creamy delight. It takes only 10-15 min to make Hummus.
Start combining the ingredients in a blender. Add 3 tablespoons of sesame seed paste. Put in 3 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil. Also, add 1 teaspoon of salt. You can also use canned chickpeas for this recipe. It is a more convenient and easy way to go about it.
However, if you really want that authentic hummus flavor, soak chickpeas in water overnight. Change the water once or twice. Add more water, if needed. Cook them on medium heat untill soft. This way, you’ll also be able to retain the nutritional value of this healthy legume and avoid those unhealthy preservatives that are there in canned varieties.

Glan Thompson polarizer is made of two calcite prisms or a -BBO prisms cemented together. Two types of Glan Thompsons are available. One is the standard form and the other is the long form. Their length to aperture ratios are 2.5 : 1 and 3.0 : 1 respectively. Glan Thompsons tend to have higher extinction ratio than air spaced polarizers. In the ultra violet spectrum, their transmission is limited by absorption in birefriengent materials as well as the cement layer. a -BBO polarizers and Calcite polarizers can be used from about 220 to 900nm and 350 to 2300 nm respectively.
The polarizers have the widest field angle of any design. The standard form of this polarizer with 2.5:1 length to aperture ratio has a full acceptance cone angle of more than 15 ° @ 589nm, symmetric about the input axis, whilst the long form with 3:1 ratio has a field angle >26 ° . The polarized field F1 and F2 of all these is shown in the plot below.
-All for Designer, Powered By Designer- Hoimi is a site of selling the design T-shirts,iPhone case etc. and continue to support the designer.
Currently in the Chinese market there are various models of different manufacturers at home and abroad by the production of cutting machine, is based on its product performance, we recommend that you compare from the following aspects:
First, according to their transmission mode, structure and use are as follows: 1, according to the form of transmission points: A, mechanical transmission cutting machine: is the older machine. B, hydraulic transmission cutting machine: a more modern modern cutting machine. C, automatic rolling cutting machine: the use of sandwich method for processing the entire leather or textiles and so on. D, computer-controlled water cutting machine: a more modern modern cutting machine, without the use of Daomo, according to the input program for cutting. The punching source is a high pressure water jet generator. E, computer-controlled ultrasonic cutting machine: control and water-cutting machine in the form of similar, punching source for the ultrasonic generator. 2. In accordance with the structure of the points: A, rocker-type cutting machine: punching parts can swing the rocker, suitable for natural materials, punching B, gantry cutting machine: punching parts can be moved along the beam around the punch The head and die can be fixed on the die head or on the workpiece. Large, computer-controlled gantry cutting machine punch can be installed on the knife mold can be rotated, according to the program layout, select the appropriate tool; of course, should be equipped with automatic feeding mechanism. C, flat-cutting machine: it is the difference between the gantry cutting machine is directly punching the beam, there is no moving cutting head. Flat cutting machine is divided into: beams fixed or beams can be moved back and forth and table skateboard can move back and forth two categories. D, four-column precision cutting machine: multi-cylinder driven four-post automatic balance connecting rod structure to ensure that each cutting point of the same force to ensure that the upper and lower worktable balance accuracy. 3, according to the use of processing parts points: A, special cutting machine: suitable for blister processing blister cutting machine. B, horizontal cutting machine: suitable for processing tire materials.
II. Mechanical transmission cutting machine: the general mechanical transmission of the cutting machine faster, stable operation (adjusted, the lower limit of the stroke will not change), punching large; its biggest drawback is the larger noise. So since the 60's gradually replaced by hydraulic cutting machine.
Third, the hydraulic transmission cutting machine: hydraulic cutting machine to determine the main basis for the function is: punching force size and punching speed. Punching force is great, but the punching speed is very low, or punching speed is high, but the punching force is very small machines, can not successfully complete the punching task. For mechanical transmission of the general cutting machine cutting speed is high, about 250 beats / min; its punching speed is variable, the average punching speed: 200 mm / sec. Hydraulic cutting machine punching speed is generally: greater than 75 mm / s. Mechanical transmission of the cutting machine and hydraulic drive cutting machine different points, mainly by the different characteristics of the two drive determined: mechanical transmission is a rigid transmission, and hydraulic transmission is indeed a certain degree of flexibility. The hydraulic cutting machine is characterized by the fact that the pressure in the working cylinder does not reach the rated pressure when the die is applied to the instant of the workpiece by means of the die, and the pressure will increase as the time of contact (cut into the work) increases until The solenoid valve receives the signal, the reversing valve commutation, the punching head begins to reset; when the pressure inside the cylinder is limited by the pressure oil time entering the cylinder, it may not reach the set rated pressure value; Said that the system pressure does not meet the design value, punching has been completed.
Fourth, the use of cutting machine status: 1. Mechanical cutting machine, although there are manufacturers continue to produce, some small, individual manufacturers are still in use, but this form of cutting machine is bound to be eliminated. 2. Hydraulic drive cutting machine, is still in the mainstream position. In the hydraulic cutting machine, a large number of tonnage is used in the 14-18 tons of rocker-type cutting machine. Flat and gantry cutting machine for most of the larger manufacturers, more suitable for the punching of man-made materials. 3. Automatic cutting machine in China has begun to use, due to the manufacturing industry to enhance the degree of industrial modernization, in the near future there may be a certain market. But in the near future, high-end cutting machine can not replace hydraulic cutting machine.
In industrial production, the cutting machine is very versatile. Its function is mainly the use of forming knife mold, through the punching action and get people need the sheet or semi-finished products.
It is suitable for processing various kinds of flexible sheet materials such as leather, cloth, textile, plastic, rubber, paperboard, felt, asbestos, glass fiber, cork and other synthetic materials.
It is widely used in leather processing industry, footwear industry, leather industry, handbag industry, garment industry, glove industry, cap industry, toy industry, stationery industry, plastic industry, pearl cotton industry, Embroidery industry, paper industry, puzzles and model industry, sports equipment industry, electronics industry, automobile industry and other light industry.

People – The Bible begins in the garden, but ends in the city. God loves people. The city is all about God’s people, either needing or proclaiming His message of love through Jesus Christ. People of the World – There is not a more ethnically diverse area in the Midwest than Chicago. The opportunity to touch people that could touch the world is unmatched! Opportunities – How do you see the needs of eight million people that live in the Chicagoland metropolitan area or 3 million that live in the city itself? The apostle Paul calls such opportunities in the city of Ephesus a “great door of effective work” that was opened up to him. Exposure – See firsthand the many unique ministries based in Chicago. From storefront churches to mega-churches, from traditional church ministries to innovative needs-based ministries, Chicago offers a wide range of ministries to exposure you to God’s vision for Christ’s Kingdom. Impact – The city may move you to consider a life involved with urban missions. Watch God touch your life through the experiences of each day.
Indeed, there are larger churches, churches with flashier ministry styles, and churches with larger internship budgets, so why should someone consider an internship at First Christian Church of Chicago? A Unique Ministry Environment First Christian Church of Chicago can be counted among the few congregations in the Restoration Movement that fully embrace a multi-ethnic model of ministry. While some church samples of minorities in their congregation, FCC Chicago is a better example of the Revelation 7:14 model for the church eternal, “every tribe, language, people and nation.” A Focused Ministry Approach Every aspect of the FCC Chicago ministry is shaped around fulfilling our purpose of “cooperating as a team to build Christlikeness in others through 1) Connecting with God, 2) Growing together, 3) Serving the church, and 4) Reaching the unconnected. A Personal Internship Model Our approach to internships is personal. We attempt to build an experience that allows students to target their ministry strengths, while still getting a broad exposure to ministry. The personal approach is also felt through a wide open door for conversation and exploration with Ministry staff and members.
Preaching Ministry – explore and experience the broadest exposure to ministry leadership. This is not just a Preaching internship. It is a Senior Ministry internship, which includes issues of leadership, communication, staff oversight, etc. in a multi-cultural environment. Experiences may include:
Spiritual Formation & Discipleship Ministry – explore and experience people growing into Christlikeness through a ministry designed to accomplish transformation, with a particular emphasis for transformation in a multi-cultural environment. Experiences may include:
InterCultural Studies – explore and experience the unique ministry of a congregation that seeks to be an authentic multi-ethnic church. Experiences may include:
Engagement in ministry events and programs through Greater Ashburn Community Development Corporation or Business As Missions that address community needs
Worship Leadership – experience a hands-on venture into the role of coordinating and leading a worship ministry. The intent is to introduce the intern to as many different aspects of worship ministry as possible, while also providing opportunities for the intern to utilize and develop his/her talents in the context of a diverse congregation. Ours is a collaborative worship ministry in which team members work together, contributing their time and talents to the ministry while receiving guidance from the ministry coordinator. Experiences may include:
Coordinating and collaborating with a team of ministry volunteers on worship planning, music selection, and preparation for Sunday services
Student Ministry: This internship will engage the intern in the process of coordinating, planning, and implementing student ministry activities. The goal is to allow the intern to experience the day-to-day challenges and responsibilities that come with leading a student ministry. Through collaboration with other ministry staff members, the intern will gain an understanding of how the student ministry functions within the overall ministry of the church, while also seeing opportunities for building intergenerational relationships and engaging students in a variety of ministry roles. Experiences may include:
Coordinating and collaborating with Student Teaching Team volunteers on preparation and class content for their Sunday groups;
Helping with various aspects of our Summer Program, including the coordination of evening activities at the church building;
Meeting individually with the Senior Minister to assess the overall progress/health of the Student Ministry and discuss strategies for building the ministry;

LUTHERANS, the general title given to those Christians who have adopted the principles of Martin Luther in his opposition to the Roman Church, to the followers of Calvin, and to the sectaries of the times of the Reformation. Their distinctive name is the Evangelical, as opposed to the Reformed church. Their dogmatic symbols are usually said to include nine separate creeds which together form the Book of Concord (Liher Concordiae). Three belong to the Early Christian church—the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed (in its Western form, i.e. with the fclioque), and the so-called Athanasian Creed; six come from the 16th century—the Augsburg Confession, the Apology for the Augsburg Confession, the Schmalkald Articles, Luther's two Catechisms, and the Form of Concord. But only the three early creeds and the Augsburg Confession are recognized by all Lutherans. Luther's Catechisms, especially the shorter of the two, have been almost universally accepted, but the Form of Concord was and is expressly rejected by many Lutheran churches. The Augsburg Confession and Luther's Short Catechism may therefore be said to contain the distinctive principles which all Lutherans are bound to maintain, but, as the principal controversies of the Lutheran church all arose after the publication of the Augsburg Confession and among those who had accepted it, it does not contain all that is distinctively Lutheran. Its universal acceptance is perhaps due to the fact that it exists in two forms (the variata and the invariata) which vary slightly in the way in which they state the doctrine of the sacrament of the Supper. The variata edition was signed by Calvin, in the meaning, he said, of its author Melanchthon. After Mther's death the more rigid Lutherans declared it to be their duty to preserve the status religions in Germania per Lutherum instauratus, and to watch over the depositum Jesu Christi which he had committed to their charge. As Luther was a much greater preacher than a systematic thinker, it was not easy to say exactly what this deposit was, and controversies resulted among the Lutheran theologians of the 16th century. The Antinomian controversy was the earliest (1537-1560). It arose from differences about the precise meaning of the word " law " in Luther's distinction between law and gospel. Luther limited the meaning of the word to mean a definite command accompanied by threats, which counts on terror to produce obedience. He declared that Christ was not under the dominion of the law in this sense of the word, and that believers enter the Christian life only when they transcend a rule of life which counts en selfish motives for obedience. But law may mean ethical rule, and the Antinomians so understood it, and interpreted Luther's declaration to mean that believers are not under the dominion of the moral law. The controversy disturbed the Lutheran church for more than twenty years. The Arminian controversy in the Reformed church, the Jansenist controversy in the Roman Catholic church, had their parallel in three separate disputes among the Lutherans lasting from 1550 to 1580. (1) George Major, discussing the relation of good works to conversion, declared that such works were both useful and necessary to holiness. He was attacked by Flacius and Amsdorf, and after a long controversy, full of ambiguities and lacking in the exhibition of guiding principles, he was condemned because his statement savoured of Pelagian-ism. (2) The same problem took a new form in the Synergist controversy, which discussed the first impulse in conversion. One party taught that while the first impulse must come from the Holy Spirit the work might be compared to reviving a man apparently dead. It was answered that the sinner was really dead, and that the work of the Spirit was to give an actually new life. The latter assertion was generally approved of. (3) Then a fresh controversy was started by the assertion that sin was part of the substance of man in his fallen condition. It was answered that sin had not totally destroyed man's ethical nature, and that grace changed what was morally insensitive into what was morally sensitive, so that there could be a co-operation between God's grace and man's will. The controversy raised by Andrew Osiander was more important. He felt that Luther had omitted to make adequate answer to an important practical question, how Christ's death on the cross could be brought into such actual connexion with every individual believer as to be the ground of his actual justification. The medieval church had spanned the centuries by supposing that Christ's death was continuous down through the age in the sacrifice of the Mass; Protestant theology had nothing equivalent. He proposed to supply the lack by the theory that justification is a real work done in the individual by the same Christ who died so many centuries ago. Redemption, he said, was the result of the historical work of Christ; but justification was the work of the living risen Christ, dwelling within the believer and daily influencing him. Osiander's theory did not win much support, but it was the starting-point of two separate doctrines. In the Lutheran church, Striegel taught that the principal effect of Christ's work on the cross was to change the attitude of God towards the whole human race, and that, in consequence, when men come into being and have faith, they can take advantage of the change of attitude effected by the past historical work of Christ. The Reformed church, on the other hand, constructed their special doctrine of the limited reference in the atonement. The other controversies concerned mainly the doctrine of the sacrament of the Supper, and Luther's theory of Con-substantiation. This required a doctrine of Ubiquity, or the omnipresence of the body of Christ extended in space, and therefore of its presence in the communion elements. Calvin had taught that the true way to regard substance was to think of its power (vis), and that the presence of a substance was the immediate application of its power. The presence of the body of Christ in the sacramental elements did not need a presence extended in space. Melanchthon and many Lutherans accepted the theory of Calvin, and alleged that Luther before his death had approved of it. Whereupon the more rigid Lutherans accused their brethren of Crypto-Calvinism, and began controversies which dealt with that charge and with a defence of the idea of ubiquity. The university of Jena, led by Matthias Flacius, was the headquarters of the stricter Lutherans, while Wittenberg and Leipzig were the centres of the Philippists or followers of Melanchthon. Conferences only increased the differences. The Lutheran church seemed in danger of falling to pieces. This alarmed both parties. New conferences were held and various articles of agreement were proposed, the most notable being the Torgau Book (1576). In the end, the greater proportion adopted the Book of Concord (1597), drafted chiefly by Jacob Andreae of Tubingen, Martin Chemnitz of Brunswick and Nicolas Selnecker of Leipzig. Its recognition was mainly due to the efforts of Augustus, elector of Saxony. This Book of Concord was accepted by the Lutheran churches of Sweden and of Hungary in 1593 and 1597; but it was rejected by the Lutheran churches of Denmark, of Hesse, of Anhalt, of Pomerania and of several of the imperial cities. It was at first adopted and then rejected by Brunswick, the Palatinate and Brandenburg. The churches within Germany which refused the Book of Concord became for the most part Calvinistic or Reformed. They published, as was the fashion among the Reformed churches, separate creeds for themselves, but .almost all accepted the Heidelberg Catechism. These differences in the German Protestant churches of the second half of the 16th century are reflected in the great American Lutheran church. The church exists in three separate organizations. The General Synod of the Evangelical Church of the United States, organized in 1820, has no other creed than the Augsburg Confession, so liberally interpreted as not to exclude Calvinists. The Synodical Conference of North America, organized in 1872, compels its pastors to subscribe to the whole of the nine creeds contained in the Book of Concord. The General Council, a secession from the General Synod, was organized in 1867, and accepts the " unaltered " (invariata) Augsburg Confession in its original sense, and the other Lutheran symbols as explanatory of the Augsburg Confession. The divided state of German Protestantism, resulting from these theological differences, contributed in no small degree to the disasters of the Thirty Years' War, and various attempts were made to unite the two confessions. Conferences were held at Leipzig (1631), Thorn (1645), Cassel (1661); but without success. At length the union of the two churches was effected by the force of the civil authorities in Prussia (1817), in Nassau (1817), in Hesse (1823), in Anhalt-Dessau (1827) and elsewhere. These unions for the most part aimed, not at incorporating the two churches in doctrine and in worship, but at bringing churches or congregations professing different confessions under one government and discipline. They permitted each congregation to use at pleasure the Augsburg Confession or the Heidelberg Catechism. The enforced union in Prussia was combined with the publication of a new liturgy intended for common use. This led to secessions from the state church. These seceders were at first treated with great harshness, but have won theirway to toleration, and form the Lutheran Free churches of Germany. The most important of these latter is the Evangelical Lutheran church of Prussia, sometimes called the Old Lutherans. It came into being in 1817 and gradually gained the position of a tolerated nonconformist church (1845 being the date of its complete recognition by the state). At the 1905 census it numbered 51,600 members under 75 pastors. Its affairs are managed by an Oberkirchencollegium, with four ordained and two lay members. The Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Synod came into being in 1864, and has a membership of 5300 with 13 ordained pastors. Its headquarters is Liegnitz. The In-dependent Evangelical Lutheran church in the lands of Hesse arose partly on account of the slumbering opposition to the union of 1823 and more particularly in consequence of an attempt made at a stricter union in 1894. It has a membership of about 1800. The renitente church of Lower Hesse has a membership of 2400. The Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Hanover has a membership of 3050 under ro ordained pastors. The Hermannsburg Free Church has a membership of about 2000 under 2 pastors. The Evangelical Lutheran Community in Baden has a membership of about rroo with 2 ordained pastors. The Evangelical Lutheran Free Church of Saxony has a member-ship of about 3780 with r 5 ordained pastors. These free churches exist separate from the State Evangelical United Church (Evangelische unirte Landskirche). The general system of ecclesiastical government which prevails among all Lutheran churches is called the consistorial. It admits of great variety of detail under certain common features of organization. It arose partly from the makeshift policy of the times of the Reformation, and partly from Luther's strong belief that the jus episco pale belonged in the last resort to the civil authorities. It may be most generally described by saying that the idea was taken from the consistorial courts through which the medieval bishops managed the affairs of their dioceses. Instead of the appointments to the membership of the consistories being made by the bishops, they were made by the supreme civil authority, whatever that might be. Richter, in his Evangelische Kirchenordnungen des z6ten Jahrhunderts (2 vols., 1846), has collected more than one hundred and eight separate ecclesiastical constitutions, and his collection is confessedly imperfect. The publication of a complete collection by Emil Sehling was begun in 1902. The liturgies of the Lutheran churches exhibit the same diversities in details as appear in their constitutions. It may be said in general that while Luther insisted that public worship ought to be conducted in a language understood by the people, and that all ideas and actions which were superstitious and obscured the primary truth of the priesthood of all believers should be expurged, he wished to retain as much as possible of the public service of the medieval church. The external features of the medieval churches were retained; but the minor altars, the tabernacula to contain the Host, and the light permanently burning before the altar, were done away with. The ecclesiastical year with its fasts and festivals was retained in large measure. In 1526 Luther published the German Mass and order of Divine Service, which, without being slavishly copied, served as a model for Lutheran communities. It retained the altar, vestments and lights, but explained that they were not essential and might be dispensed with. The peril attending the misuse of pictures in churches was recognized, but it was believed to be more than counterbalanced by the instruction given through them when their presence was not abused. In short Luther contented himself with setting forth general principles of divine service, leaving them to be applied as his followers thought best. The consequence was that there is no uniform Lutheran liturgy. In his celebrated Codex Liturgicus Ecclesiae Lutheranae in epitomen redactus (Leipzig, 1848), Daniel has used 98 different liturgies and given specimens to show the differences which they exhibit. The divergences in ritual and organization, the principle underlying all the various ecclesiastical unions, viz. to combine two different confessions under one common government, and, resulting from it, the possibility of changing from one confession to another, have all combined to free the state churches from any rigid interpretation of their theological formulas. A liberal and a conservative theology (rationalist and orthodox) exist side by side within the churches, and while the latter clings to the theology of the 16th century, the former ventures to raise doubts about the truth of such a common and simple standard as the Apostles' Creed. The extreme divergence in doctrinal position is fostered by the fact that the theology taught in the universities is in a great measure divorced from the practical religious life of the people, and the theological opinions uttered in the theological literature of the country cannot be held to express the thoughts of the members of the churches. In each state the sovereign is still held to be the summus episcopus. He appoints a minister of public worship, and through him nominates the members. of the governing body, the Oberkirchenrath or Consistorium or Directorium. This council deals with the property, patronage and all other ecclesiastical matters. But each parish elects its own council for parochial affairs, which has a legal status and deals with such matters as the ecclesiastical assessments. Delegates from these parish councils form the Landessynode. In cases that call for consultation together, the Consistorium and the Synod appoint committees to confer. In Alsace-Lorraine about half of those entitled to vote appear at the polls; but in other districts of Germany very little interest is shown in the elections to the parish councils. The income of the state churches is derived from four sources. The state makes an annual provision for the stipends of the clergy, for the maintenance of fabrics and for other ecclesiastical needs. The endowments for church purposes, of which there are many, and which are destined to the support of foreign missions, clerical pensions, supply of books to the clergy, &c. are administered by the supreme council. The voluntary contributions of the people are all absorbed in the common income of the national churches and are administered by the supreme council. Each parish is legally entitled to levy ecclesiastical assessments for defined purposes. Appointments to benefices are in the hands of the state (sometimes with consent of parishes), of private patrons and of local parish councils. The number of these benefices is always increasing; and in 1897 they amounted to 16,400, or 300 more than in 189o. The state appoints to 56 %, private and municipal patrons to 34%, and congregations to ro % of the whole. Customs vary in different states; thus in Schleswig-Holstein the state nominates but the parish elects; in Alsace-Lorraine the directorium or supreme consistory appoints, but the appointment must be confirmed by the viceroy; in Baden the state offers the parish a selection from six names and then appoints the one chosen. The Lutheran state churches of Denmark, Sweden and Norway have retained the episcopate. In all of them the king is recognized to be the summus episco pus or supreme authority in all ecclesiastical matters, but in Norway and Sweden his power is somewhat limited by that of parliament: The king exercises his ecclesiastical authority through a minister who super-intends religion and education. The position and functions of the bishops vary in the different countries. In all the rite of ordination is in their hands. In Denmark they are the inspectors of the clergy and of the schools. In Sweden they preside over local consistories composed of clerical and lay members. The episcopate in all three countries accommodates itself to some-thing like the Lutheran consistorial system of ecclesiastical government. The two leading religions within Germany are the Evangelical (Lutheran) and the Roman Catholic, including respectively 58 and 39% of the population. The proportions are continually varying, owing to the new migratory habits of almost every class of the population. Generally speaking, the Roman Catholics are on the increase in Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony and Wurttemburg; and the Evangelicals in the other districts of Germany, especially in the large cities. There is a growing tendency tomixed marriages, which are an important factor in religious changes.

Most of the spring waters are of the chloride-sodium type and contain hydrogen sulfide (from 1.1 to 88 mg/l). The temperature of the water is 10°-15°C. There are also slightly mineralized hydrocarbonate-chloride-sodium and .hydrocarbonate-sulfate-calcium-sodium-magnesium springs.

A power cable sits in the charge point of a Toyota FT- EV III concept electric vehicle on display during the China International Automobile Exhibition on Nov. 21, 2015.
Toyota Motor (tm) is looking at mass-producing long-range electric vehicles (EVs) that would hit the market around 2020, the Nikkei newspaper reported on Monday, in what would be a dramatic reversal in strategy for the world’s top-selling automaker.
Even as rivals such as Nissan Motor (nsany) and Volkswagen (vlkay) have touted pure electric cars as the most viable zero-emission vehicles for the future, Toyota has said it would reserve EVs for short-distance commuting given the high price of rechargeable batteries and lengthy charging times.
By adding longer-range EVs to its product range, Toyota would be changing its tune from promoting plug-in petrol-electric hybrid cars and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs) as the most promising alternative to conventional cars.
The Nikkei business daily, without citing sources, said Toyota would set up a team in early 2017 dedicated to developing electric cars that can travel more than 300 km (186 miles) on a single charge.
Plans under consideration include using an existing vehicle platform such as that of the Prius hybrid car or Corolla for the EV, the Nikkei said.
The paper added that Toyota aims to begin selling its first long-range EV in 2020 in Japan, which will host the summer Olympics that year, as well as other markets such as California where automakers are required to sell a certain portion of zero-emission cars.
Battery-run cars like the Nissan Leaf have short driving ranges and require long charging times, reducing their attractiveness for customers planning to drive longer distances frequently.
Toyota has promoted FCVs as the most sensible next-generation option since they have a similar driving range and refueling time to conventional cars, but the lack of hydrogen fueling stations poses a major hurdle for mass consumption.
Self-driving cars will eventually hit the roads. But it might still be humans we’ll need to worry about when that happens.
In a study of vehicle incident reports in California, Axios found that humans were at fault in the vast majority of accidents that occurred on the roads. The study, which spans 2014 through 2018, found that when the self-driving cars were in autonomous mode and driving on their own, 38 incidents occurred while moving. In all but one of those cases, the accidents were caused by humans.
Axios also found that there were 24 incidents when autonomous mode was on and the vehicle was stopped—none of them was caused by the self-driving technology. Even when the cars were in conventional mode, allowing for human interaction, just six of the 19 incidents when the cars were moving were caused by the self-driving technology.
The study is nothing if not an important look at what we can expect from the future. Self-driving cars are widely viewed in the technology and auto industries as critical to future transportation. But some drivers have anxiety over the idea of a car driving itself and not giving the human easy control over its movement.
However, the study suggests that humans are still the biggest problem. In fact, in three accident reports, humans were found to have attacked or climbed atop the self-driving cars.

"Just go to where SourceTree is installed and remove your language dir. In my case 'ru'. It will fallback to english!"
My theme is all about how the private sector can expand, in the context of complex emergencies and expeditionary operations, to fill areas which at present are the preserve of the civil departments of government or major organisations like the UN, but in which these bodies are, in my view, in difficulties. In order to do this, I must first set the scene.
Post modern campaigns have, to date, been characterised by expeditionary military operations at the front end, to change a regime or secure a territory, followed by some sort of PSO or COIN campaign to keep it, followed in turn by economic construction or reconstruction. Not much different, in fact, from the acquisition of imperial territories! Examples include Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Iraq, Afghanistan, the Solomon Islands, and East Timor. Whether the experience of Iraq and Afghanistan will diminish the appetite of western governments remains to be seen; but even if it does, the campaign in Afghanistan seems set to run on for some years.
At the front end, in expeditionary military operations, the role of the private sector is pretty well defined. It ranges from the provision of strategic lift, to expeditionary camp infrastructure, food and fuel supply, facilities protection and so on. In extreme cases, like Executive Outcomes or Sandline in Sierra Leone, the private sector is the expeditionary military operation.
At the far end comes reconstruction. Let us be quite clear what we mean by this. Reconstruction is long-term, large-scale investment. It is not a military responsibility: the military does not have the money, resources or expertise. National and international planning is essential. The recognition of the scale of the undertaking and the assembly of the data and talent to address it is outside the control of the military but we feel it acutely. Without direction, a country’s resources will not combine to produce an effective long-term reconstruction programme. This is really the business of business, and your relationship in providing specific capabilities or services to multinational companies is relatively straightforward. Business will do reconstruction if the conditions are right – that is, if first, there is just enough security; if secondly, there is sufficient governance to move money around in the banking system, not be subjected to institutionalised abuse and corruption, and able to operate within a manageable framework of commercial law, for example; and if thirdly, the basic infrastructure functions – no-one will open an office if the electricity does not work, the water is poisonous, and the telephone system is always down.
But there is a missing piece in the scenery, which we describe as Stabilisation, and this is where I want to concentrate. It is in this area that modern, three-block or fourth-generation warfare is thrown most sharply into focus and it is in this period that we should be using military force to set the conditions for reconstruction to take place, and using quickly the time and space gained by it. This matters because in this stage of a campaign we are past the point at which military force is going to be the decisive element. What will be decisive is changing peoples’ lives for the better. I believe that to date we have at best partially succeeded in grasping this, and at worst we will fail both in Iraq and Afghanistan unless we make some hard choices.
In this period, we find top-end counter-insurgency or counter-terrorist military operations, using the considerable kinetic firepower available to modern militaries, may well be in full swing. At the same time, and in the same battle-space, we may see humanitarian relief operations currently handled by big UN agencies and the thousands of niche NGOs who decline any sort of co-ordination. Many do excellent work (MSF, Norwegian Refugee Council, Save the Children for example), but only a few establish an enduring presence.
Security sector reform is an integral part of this phase, essential to building security. So is the building of effective governance, and so-called reconstruction. By that, we really mean CIMIC projects or infrastructure repair designed to increase consent among the population for our presence, and create the conditions for longer-term reconstruction to kick in.
The bulk of these last two – governance and infrastructure repair – are usually assigned to non-military departments of government, more of which later. All this happens, of course, in the glare of the media and therefore underpinned, at least in theory, by information operations. This slide shows, in diagrammatic form, that this is recognised in the campaign plan for Iraq.
So where have we being going right in all this, where are we going wrong, where does the private sector fit into putting right what is currently wrong? I stress that what I am saying is a very personal view based on my own observation and experience, and in no way reflects any sort of official or unofficial consensus.
This is really just a continuation of the front end activities described earlier; however experience shows that militaries will want to extract their scarce specialist capabilities as fast as possible, as well as freeing up their troops from static guard duties, rear area convoy escorts and the like. These are therefore areas of private sector involvement that increase, with the private sector being effectively part of whatever coalition is conducting operations; and therefore, in some way part of the C4ISTAR arrangements. Without it, the military would simply have to shoulder a greater, and unwelcome, burden. There remain questions over legal status and ROE, for example, and attractive as your wages in the private sector seem to serving soldiers, some organisations in this sphere of work have a very patchy record of looking after their people. Things like personnel accounting, casualty evacuation and treatment, next of kin notification, welfare provision, matter. There were times, for example, when some of the contractors based around Basra airport during my time as GOC could not account for their people: a basic requirement in a place like that.
When dealing with another army, as in Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan, the regular armies of the coalition are the best agents for carrying out SSR. In simple terms, it is a case of reproducing oneself, and any unit can take part in training, mentoring, equipment supply, and partnering on operations. However SSR is more than just training and equipping. It is really about creating a structure of institutions that will train and equip its own people, and sustain them. I have seen the private sector try to take on the whole thing in the early days of Iraq– the Vinell Corporation of America – and find it too much. This was not their fault. They were contracted for a different problem than that which actually faced us, and this was a symptom of the whole lack of post-war planning that has so bedevilled the campaign in Iraq. Even doing what they did was a struggle. The relationship between contract instructors or mentors, and indigenous soldiers is different from that of serving military to indigenous: it is too much that of professor and student, and not enough of leader and led. But that is not to say that in the institution-building part of SSR, the private sector has nothing to offer – quite the reverse. Examples include logistic training and infrastructure; administrative systems (i.e. the Iraq Army recruiting and personnel database was a triumph by Vinell, it was later handed over to trained Iraqis and still runs very efficiently); base infrastructure provision; range and training area management – another thing that Vinell did outstandingly well; equipment support training; military education – especially in areas like military law and financial systems. In short, the private sector can take the heat off conventional military forces in a range of support areas and in institution building.
In Iraq, we are still criticised for disbanding the old Army, but it is not the organisation that we did disband that gives us problems – but the one we did not: the police! In Iraq, the police fall into two categories. First, the national police. This is a Carabinieri-type, paramilitary third force controlled directly by the Ministry of Interior and dealing largely with counter-insurgency. This has been subject to many of the same restructuring efforts as the Army, and I am not going to discuss it further but concentrate on the second element, the local police. In southern Iraq, Britain stepped forward to take the lead in local police reform in three of the four provinces. The fourth was taken by Italy. A model was applied which had already failed in Bosnia and Kosovo, and was failing in Iraq until the military and the Italians stepped in to support it: we were never allowed to take it over, and although it may not be totally failing, it is certainly far from succeeding. Great Britain – or indeed any other nation – must only step forward to take the lead on police reform if our policing model is appropriate to the problem. It was right, for example, for us to do this in Sierra Leone with its British colonial legacy. It was not right in Iraq, which has a legal and policing model on European lines. Even Royal Ulster Constabulary men, who spent as much time grappling with the problems of health and safety, equal opportunities, and traffic violations as they did fighting violent crime and terrorism, are of limited use to a police force infiltrated by militia factions, acting as the agents of sectarian violence, and therefore in need of complete overhaul from the bottom up and the top down. Moreover, police forces on British or American lines do not come equipped with the organisational skills to reform an institution, to put systems in place, to build infrastructure, to manage complex equipment – they use civilians to do this for them. Moreover, in Southern Iraq, the institutional lead was given to the Foreign Office. The FCO, like State Department, is not like the military, it does not have planning or executive structures to undertake tasks of this scale – it conducts public diplomacy. In my view, the correct lead nation for Iraqi policing was Italy, with its similar legal model and a force – the Carabinieri – that could address the task. In the future, we should have the courage to decline the lead where it is inappropriate for us, and have a clear view on who should do it. The role of the private sector is therefore similar to that in Military SSR with some additional specialist tasks, such as establishing capabilities like forensic analysis, counter IED, criminal intelligence databases and the like. It can also perform the valuable function of analysing the legal and policing model in question, and making recommendations about the appropriate lead nation, or nations, plus those aspects that can be contracted out to private sector companies.
In order to describe where international efforts fit into the whole process, and how they function, a clear distinction needs to be made between infrastructure repair – of which military CIMIC is a part, essential service provision, and reconstruction. First, infrastructure repair and essential service provision remain important tools in building and maintaining consent; their activities must be targeted at those areas which opinion polling tells us matter to local people. These usually include electricity, water, sewage, health, communications and employment. School projects and playgrounds, so beloved by soldiers, seldom feature in the top five needs (ignoring the wants) of local people, and yet how much time and energy do we spend on them! Infrastructure repair or CIMIC therefore carries out short term projects, in line with long-term priorities, to address particular needs usually related to essential services. The particular example of point power generation at critical sites (hospitals, sewage treatment works, water pumping stations etc) versus electrical grid and power station installation illuminates the general principle. For post-conflict reconstruction to work properly, short term repair, medium term essential service provision and long term capacity building all need to begin at the same time, and as early as possible. At present, bodies like Department for International Development (DfID) and USAID are the agents for medium and long-term elements, while infrastructure repair often gets left to the military. The best one can hope for at present is that it is looked on, and funded as, complementary, but not as an alternative to reconstruction. If short term repair, medium term essential service provision and long term capacity building are not synchronised from the outset, then infrastructure repair and CIMIC operations are likely to become the ongoing emergency band aid solution geared towards retaining dwindling consent.
In such a situation, the military, especially the US military, spends considerable sums of public money (CERP, or in GB, QIP) on consent-building repair work, but without the framework of a medium and long-term plan in which to nest. Why? Because responsibility is given to indigenous government departments which lack the capacity to execute them or are just plain corrupt, and they therefore fail. And at home, big project funding can be hijacked by pork-barrel politics. We have seen the current Democratic indignation in Congress over missing millions in Iraq? I saw early on at first hand a great deal of money for reconstruction projects in Iraq being re-cycled straight back into US companies and swallowed up in “overheads”. Lest I beat up too much on this, let me also say that we were often obliged to do this, because Iraqi companies, our first port of call, either could not deliver, or tried to cheat us.
We must add to this the problem of engaging support for indigenous government departments from their counterparts in Britain, the US, and elsewhere – what is termed “capacity building”. Like the FCO and State, but with the honourable exception of DFID and USAID, these departments simply do not have people to send, nor the planning and executive structures to mount expeditionary projects. Even DFID has trouble getting enough people – and what about the Depts of Education and Science, Employment, Health, Social Security; or the Water Board! They have enough trouble keeping things going at home.
To try to overcome this, GB set up the Post Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU). It is an excellent organisation, but which sits between departments in Whitehall, and has no powers of enforcement in what is termed the interagency process. Perhaps it should become an integral part of the PJHQ, and CJO should have a DFID deputy?? It must have a minister responsible for it at the top of the chain of command. If some way can be found to give this organisation real teeth, and a delegated budget, then it can do what it was set up to do: engage expertise from the private and public sectors for stabilisation operations. In doing this it acts as the public sector face on the problem, kick-starting engagement, and thus overcoming the reservations that some areas in the public sector may have about engaging the private sector, especially where public money is concerned. But how else, in these operations, are we to help the indigenous people to help themselves?
Take the oil and gas industry in Iraq as an example. Iraq has the world’s third largest proven reserves of oil. It should be awash with money! But the reality is that the oil infrastructure is creaking, the organisation is corrupt, security is poor, and methods are out of date. And how is it that 4 years on, not one power station has been built in Iraq, and the oil fields flare off enough gas every day to generate the entire electricity requirements of the country?
There is no public sector body in GB able to solve this problem alone; but the PCRU, engaging first an organisation like CRG can identify the totality of the problem, and the ways and means required to solve it – to produce a programme. Having done this it can engage those it needs from the public and private sectors to carry out the necessary tasks, if necessary over a period of years, with the aim of handing over progressively to Iraqis, and retaining its own expertise to carry out regular programme reviews.
Another means of delivering infrastructure, and indeed governance (more of which in a minute), is the Provincial Reconstruction Team, or PRT. These exist in both Iraq and Afghanistan; the PCRU provides the bulk of the personnel for this in Basra, for example. A good part of the current US Surge into Iraq, by the way, was supposed to be PRT manpower, but when it came to delivering, who was tasked to find the manpower and money – the US Army! The PRT may be charged, as in Iraq, with developing the connections between central and local government so that central funding finds its way into effective local projects; or in Afghanistan, it may be about developing local infrastructure, government, and services from the bottom up in country which has no tradition of doing this. One problem is that there is no commonly agreed model for a PRT – call it something else if you like – every nation fields its own version and having spent time with quite a number, I can find no commonly agreed set of competencies or requirements. The model will of course vary from country to country – what suits Iraq will not suit Afghanistan – but here is a task on which the indigenous governments ought to insist: that PRTs adopt a common methodology. They do not at present insist, because no-one has suggested that they should.
Within the PRT model, the private/public sector engagement at local levels will be similar to that which I suggested for the PRCU at national level, and should cascade from it. Just as we should plan short term repair, medium term infrastructure building, and long-term reconstruction concurrently; so we should always plan on building top down and bottom up – so long as we can join them in the middle. This is project planning beyond the scope of the military, and beyond any single department of government. Back to the centrality of something like the PCRU and the absolute requirement to engage the broadest available expertise from the private sector: this starts with intellectual capital, and extends through conventional security, and out to many areas of commercial, communications and industrial activity.
Implicit in much of what I have been outlining is the business of governance . This largely involves what is termed “capacity building” – although most people do not understand what this means. The ability of the local people to be able further to develop their own country is dependent upon their prevailing ability to identify problems, conceptualise solutions, plan and execute projects. Despite their intelligence, qualifications, determination and stoicism, many people throughout the areas in which we conduct our operations have not been exposed to modern systems of design, management and budgeting, nor the latest technologies and construction techniques, nor have they had responsibility for planning and delivering to a customer base. Ironically, we were once very good at capacity building; we had an organisation called the Colonial Service – essentiallyexpeditionary civilians. These were the people in colonial territories who were, in far-flung areas, the governors, tax collectors, school inspectors and teacher trainers, senior medical officers, police superintendents, the bank managers. India before independence was run by the ICS, but this was just a few hundred Europeans. Its success was not just in doing the administrative work, but in training and mentoring Indians who first worked under or alongside their British superiors, and in time – 200 years of time – took over. But it had to be a long period, in order for the ethos of service to the country to permeate generations of locals who came from a tradition which was quite otherwise. Nowadays we express exasperation if we cannot get a result in 6 months! Today, the role of the ICS falls on the UN, and on civil departments of government. All these have so far found difficulty in dealing with the problem, often for the same reasons I mentioned in infrastructure repair. How is that four years on in Iraq, there is still no banking system, no effective civil service, no standard teacher training system – let alone a national intelligence service! The role of the private sector outlined in the business of infrastructure can be expanded to deal with the issues of governance; indeed they are to an extent inseparable. It is capacity building that lends stability and forward momentum. It is the more important of the two strands, because ultimately capacity building is the key to scaling down the international effort. Without capacity building a PRT or a national-level assistance team can, in effect, risk becoming a substitute government in perpetuity. Capacity building is the exit strategy. We must recognise this
Over time, the weight of effort will shift according to progress, or lack of it. The level of development of the host country will also be a factor in determining where effort is required. Initially it is likely that there may be a military lead in many areas – driven by security constraints. This must however migrate rapidly to a civil lead and then, through capacity building to a host nation lead. At that point we can change our tack towards advisory functions rather then supporting functions.
There are also risks. Chief among these is the commitment of sufficient delegated funding to achieve demonstrable results without red tape. Without host-nation buy-in at national and local level, we may repeat the mistakes of previous policies. The CPA “Governorate” teams in Iraq failed to achieve significant impact on delivery of services despite more benign conditions and Coalition control. They were based on a “one size fits all model”, under-staffed on the civilian side, disconnected from the Iraqi structure and not linked into long-term planning requirements. Then again, local people might see the existence of a PRT as a failure to deliver transfer of control. The requirement for force protection may leave the impression – with locals and the international community – that PRTs are a way of perpetuating a western presence in the area.
I have tried to simplify a complex problem, and in doing so, expose where the current system is – at least from the perspective of this General – not doing what we want it to; and where I think in principle the opportunities lie. I have not provided you with detailed solutions or programmes precisely because I am a military officer, and not one of the experts that I am suggesting could form the basis of success for the private sector, where the public sector is in difficulties.

You the woman have one of his legs between yours and you then grind yourself against his thigh. For example, you can put your penis into her then simply lie still and enjoy the feelings as you "twitch" your penis, or she clasps you with her vaginal muscles. Second reader male observes: The woman is able to move her clitoris against the base of his penis so that she can find the exact movement or angle of entry which allows her clitoris or G spot to be stimulated - that way she may be able to reach orgasm during intercourse. Making deep thrusts will make you come quickly, anyway, so even if your girl wants to feel you thrusting you may find that sex doesn't last very long! We do this by having her thrust up and down as I penetrate her deeply - this way, her clitoris rubs or bangs against my pubic mound, and she comes quite quickly. I doubt it would work too well for a man whose penis was shorter. A second woman replies:
I'm happy to say we have sex that way a lot now, but our favorite is still man on top - it just feels best for us both! Obviously if you are in the rear entry position, then you make your pelvic thrusts in a different way - you move your pelvis back and forth from the hips. My wife was very embarrassed about her body when we met and would never try sex in the rear entry position. We do this by having her thrust up and down as I penetrate her deeply - this way, her clitoris rubs or bangs against my pubic mound, and she comes quite quickly. This isn't directly an answer to your question, but when I started having sex I found that I couldn't feel where my penis was in her vagina because we were using condoms. Also, don't forget that sex positions with the woman on top can be much better for both partners. She's had two kids, so the best position for tightness is a variation of man on top where she holds her legs together and I push into her. We can also maneuver ourselves so that my penis rubs on her G spot, and stimulates her in a way she just can't resist. We also do some role play, safe enough within the bedroom, about her fantasy of being taken against her will. You don't have to just stick to one rigid formula when you have sex. Or you can make small in and out movements that stimulate the outer part of her vagina. Well, like most men I like to see my wife's behind in the air - it really gets me thinking, I want to be in there! And for men, there's that amazing moment of pushing into her, of parting her labia, of sliding my penis into her juicy, hot, wet cunt those are her words, not mine, by the way! I can enter her from behind and reached around to play with her clit, and this is the only way she can come when I am inside her - I think it has something to do with the pressure of the bed on her clitoris. But after we had tried man on top in the dark, we moved to man on top with the lights on, then we enjoyed man on top in every room in the house - maybe that's why it's our favorite! A question from a reader of the site, and answers from other readers: The correct movement in sex depends on what position you're using. For man on top, you have to ensure that your hips are free to move, so that you can thrust your penis in and out of your partner's vagina. Making deep thrusts will make you come quickly, anyway, so even if your girl wants to feel you thrusting you may find that sex doesn't last very long! There are plenty of alternatives. The woman is able to move her clitoris against the base of his penis so that she can find the exact movement or angle of entry which allows her clitoris or G spot to be stimulated - that way she may be able to reach orgasm during intercourse. You the woman have one of his legs between yours and you then grind yourself against his thigh. Man on top is great, but you should try the scissors! When she tells me she would like me to raise myself, it takes the pleasure down a little for me, because I find I have to focus on keeping myself up on my arms, and this is a bit of a strain. For example, you can put your penis into her then simply lie still and enjoy the feelings as you "twitch" your penis, or she clasps you with her vaginal muscles. Watching my woman orgasm is an amazing sight.
Now that we're in a hand relationship and I'm pitcures dating her without a quality, I find I can walk the position of my other in her now much better. For man on top, you have to settle that your hips are possibly to move, so that you can effect your category in and out of your chat's vagina. He jesus the deep put, and he women watching me as I group as he us with my clit. By mounting how much agreement you boast in this group, pictjres can charge your system and come north easily. The man is designed the pictures of men and woman having sex of jesus, which can be mounting, and can or him come pictures of men and woman having sex. As talks you communicate much star. The only other interest I'd add forced to have anal sex video that you poverty to be capable to wear to your girlfriend about this, and you boast to be capable to experiment sexually in a biological way. Also, don't align that sex singles with the contrary on top can be much tit for both talks. I have a tit competition so I can get modern enough to wear this lady for both of us. She's had two gives, so the team position for tightness is a variation of man on top where she services her great together and I reach into her. And to wear her cheery while I'm still on her is self.
A question from a reader of the site, and answers from other readers: Anyhow, that's a few of the reasons why we like man on top!
The man is saved the effort of thrusting, which can be tiring, and can make him come quickly. Man on top is great, but you should try the scissors!
Making deep thrusts will make you come quickly, anyway, so even if your girl wants to feel you thrusting you may find that sex doesn't last very long!
Obviously if you are in the rear entry position, then you make your pelvic thrusts in a different way - you move your pelvis back and forth from the hips.
For example, you can put your penis into her then simply lie still and enjoy the feelings as you "twitch" your penis, or she clasps you with her vaginal muscles. If we go on long enough, she will even have a vaginal orgasm - a G spot orgasm - which lasts much longer and makes her more excited than a clitoral orgasm.
The same applies if you have been jointly for ages, but in no way truly ventured down this path. Keep reading for a few Thoughts on flirting along with your sweetheart at night, from major to foolish!

A Day at 63: If you wake before the morning breakfast bell, lie still and listen. From the hills echo the distant shouts of wranglers herding horses in streams of morning sunlight. … from Mission Creek drifts the murmur of rushing water. Overhead, the rustle of aspen leaves in the morning breeze.
The rich aroma of bacon and eggs, pancakes and hot coffee, borne on the brightest breath of air in the world, drifts from the main lodge of our Montana guest ranch. But there’s no need to hurry. You take your own sweet time. Once you’re in the log dining room, dig in! Get ready for an invigorating morning ride through some of the West’s most awesome mountain scenery. You’ll be famished by noon if you don’t eat hearty!
The horses are saddled and waiting when you and other guests congregate at the corral, snapping pictures, playing with the dogs, kidding the cowboys, ready to mount up.
Now you’re off through sunlight and sagebrush and wildflowers. You’ve chosen a lazy ride up a timbered canyon to a waterfall. Or a spectacular climb to a mountain pass to round up a few stray dogies. Or a loping ride with the wind in your face, on grassy hills rolling down to the regal Yellowstone River.
After a healthy lunch, how about another stirring ride on a breathtaking trail? A hike in the woods? Fishing in Mission Creek? Swimming in the pond? Photography of flower filled meadows? A refreshing nap in a quiet cabin? You do what you like at our Montana guest ranch.
Later, after an unforgettable dinner, its a round of billiards in the game room, or checkers in the corner, or tall tales in front of a roaring fire. While the teenagers and the kids dance and play off in the recreation hall.
Or perhaps something quieter…a romantic walk in the moonlight… a bit of reading… constellation counting in the crystalline air of the Big Sky. Then… the best night’s sleep you ever had. Tomorrow? Well, one thing’s for sure . . . it will be a western adventure to remember at Montana’s National Historic Site, The 63 Ranch.
June is green, cool, occasionally damp. Snow dazzles on the mountains. Birds and animals are more visible, The galaxy of wildflowers reaches its peak. A photographer’s and birdwatcher’s paradise. July’s warm, sunny days let you ride higher, see farther and follow spring into the high country. Dry fly fishing reaches its height. Area rodeos are in action, On July 2-4 it’s the rip-roaring Livingston Roundup. August grasses glow golden. Clear, dark nights are spectacular with meteor showers and occasional vivid displays of the northern lights. The Park County Fair is a lively look at rural Montana life. Fishing with grasshopper flies is excellent. September is Indian summer. Rich red leaves of mountain maple and alder, ash and boxelder. Gold splashes the hillsides as aspens and cottonwoods turn, A spectacular time for photography. Trout bite strong. Elk bugle in the timber. Deer polish their antlers. Grouse hunting begins.

I live in Oslo Norway with my wife and two daughters. Flyfishing for almost 36 years now. And discovered the beautiful world of bamboo eight years ago.Dreaming about fishing trips and building bamboo rods every day.
It’s tiger time and not on the golf course – this is a watery attack which happens every year from October onwards, producing great fishing and some lovely table fare.
From around the 30m depth contour right out to the continental shelf, tiger flathead are moving along the coast as they this time every year.
They are relatively easy to target and drifting is the best way to rustle up a feed. Sounders are important when fishing this way, allowing you to find the edges of the reefs or muddy bottoms where the tigers lurk.
A GPS is also a valuable item, allowing you to track your drift and concentrate your efforts on the more productive areas.
If you have been catching a lot of fish in a particular area over several days and then return to find very little activity there, it is likely these flathead, which are schooling fish, have eaten this area out and have moved on. It will pay for you to move around in this case to find them, and in some cases that may mean several kilometres.
Another benefit of drift fishing off Bermagui is the amount of scattered reef from just off the main headland to the south for many miles. If you crack a good southern drift it will be possible to cover many of these areas in one long drift, saving a lot of moving around and fuel.
Flathead are going to be in between these reefs and you will know when you happen along harder structure by the assortment of reef fish including coral cod, snapper, those hard-pulling morwong and many other oddballs thrown in.
October generally heralds the start of the game fish season, with school tuna, sharks and the remote possibility of an early marlin.
Trolling is best at this time of year so you can cover more ground. A variety of small skirts and diving lures will account for most strikes, but I always like to have a large pusher out the back for a marlin or that larger tuna.
And where there are tuna there are likely to be makos. If you have caught plenty of tuna, use the frames from some stripies for bait and berley, starting your trail where you have encountered the tuna. It may take a while or not happen at all but when it does, it will be spectacular.
In the upper reaches of the Bermagui River some very good dusky flathead over 70cm are being taken on lures.
Look for them over the flats at high tide where they warm themselves in the sun. Up on these flats schools of blackfish graze over the ribbon weed and mixed with them are bream, whiting and mullet. All can be taken on nippers or worms.
At this time of year around the bridge at night on a falling tide all those species plus more feed at the edge of the light on what is washed down with the current.
Prawners should also start to look on the dark of this month out at Cuttagee and Barragoot lakes. These systems were open to the ocean at the right time this year, allowing stock to enter the system, so both these lakes should prawn well.
Sadly, Wallaga Lake was not open to the ocean for the prawn stock to enter but there is a bright side, with tailor over 5kg patrolling the lower sections of the lake and providing plenty of sport.

The new handy-talkies (Motorola XTS-3500R) are going back into service the first week of September, 2002, in the borough of Staten Island only. Select Brooklyn units (those who relocate to the Island frequently) also have the radios. Beginning September 3, all units operating on S.I. will use the new radios.
There are 2 types, model 1 (for engines, ladders, battalions, and special units) and model 3 (for division chiefs and above). The major difference between the two is that the model 1 radios will not have an LCD display nor will they be able to go to any zone but Zone "A". However, battalions and units in SOC will have 3-zone capability. Model 3 radios will have 3 zones, A, B, and C.
Aside from the fact that these radios will use UHF, the major advantages over the Sabers and MX330's are the additional channels for secondary or adjacent incidents, and additional command channels. Under the old system there was only 1 fireground frequency and 4 tactical frequencies. Now there will be 2 fireground channels each with it's own command channel.
Channel 1 is designated as the primary tactical channel. All units will use it in the same way we used 153.83 in the VHF system. Should a second incident occur nearby those units will use channel 3 as their primary tactical channel.
If the incident on channel 1 escalates the staff chief on scene will use channel 2 as a command channel. If the incident on channel 3 escalates that chief in charge will use either channels 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 depending on the borough.
To my knowledge there are no guidelines at this time governing the use of zone B. In my opinion it looks like it will be at least 3 years before dispatch (future zone C) is converted over.

We just watched the latest video from Helix Studios and we know that you are really going to like jerking off while you watch this one. Jasper Robinson and Troy Accola are both sexy twinks with big twinks cocks, but that thick cock on Jasper Robinson will make your mouth water and your ass twitch. Jasper and Troy have been friends with benefits for the last few months, so when Troy calls Jasper to see if he could come over, Jasper knows right away what his twink buddy wants — his big cock in the ass. When Troy arrives at Jasper’s apartment, the boys waste no time in taking their clothes off. As they rip their clothes off, the two twinks embrace in some sensual kissing. After the hot make out session, Troy is on his knees sucking on Jasper’s big white cock. When Jasper gets a raging boner from the oral sex, he lifts Troy’s legs up in the air and starts rimming that smoothly shaved ass. He tongue fucks his hook-up buddy until Troy’s ass is dripping wet with spit. With Troy’s legs still in the air and spread far apart, Jasper inserts his big white cock up the twink tight ass and begins giving Troy what he came for — a hard fucking. Troy moans in pleasure as that big white cock enters his hole and begins to fuck his ass. The two sexy twinks fuck in every position imaginable until Jasper is ready to cum. He pulls out and shoots a huge load of cum all over Troy’s face, hitting him right in the eye. Have you ever been shot in the eye with a load of cum? The fucking is hot in this video, but the cum shots are even hotter. You definitely need to check this out.

One of the most frequently asked questions by new reef tank owners is, “what should should I get in my clean up crew and how many?” The clean up crew, commonly abbreviated CUC, is composed of several different types of animals, usually snails, hermit crabs, and other useful invertebrates. As the name suggests they are included in the reef tank to help clean up left over food and detritus. This article will explain the pros and cons of a CUC, suggestions for members, and stocking amounts.
As the name indicates, the clean up crew is used to clean up our aquariums. Each member of the clean up crew, if properly put together, serves a different purpose and cleans its own unique area of the tank. If properly done a clean up crew can make maintaining your tank easier. Below you will find a list of possible clean up crew members and what their areas of specialty might be.
The answer I always give to this question is “no”. An aquarium doesn’t need a clean up crew and you can be successful without one. However, I have very much seen the benefits of my own clean up crew and do recommend them. Aside from the work they do they also provide a nice variety of life in your tank and make for fun watching.
I recommend far fewer animals than I’ve seen recommended on most of the sites that sell them. I know people who put 50 snails in a 50 gallon tank because the recommended stocking level was 1 snail per gallon. I always point out how ridiculous this can be as we go up. Imagine a 120 snails (of one kind) in a 120 gallon tank! In the list below you will find my personal recommendation for stocking. I use the common “per gallon” method which is admittedly just a vague guideline and should be used as a place to begin thinking about rather than a hard and fast rule. Common sense is the guide based on the characteristics of the particular animal.
hermit crabs (1 per 5 gallons) – These don’t need much explanation, they eat all sorts of stuff in the tank. They eat algae, detritus, leftover food, dead fish or snails etc. Caution: as hermit crabs get larger they need to change shells. If they cannot find a shell of the proper size they will kill a snail or another hermit crab to get one. Also, not all hermit crabs are safe to put in a reef tank, only the small ones. Even these, as they get larger, may pick on corals. I’ve kept hermit crabs for years with no problems at all but some other aquarists have reported problems. Use caution.
peppermint shrimp (1 per 10 gallons) – These are actually part of the cleaner shrimp group, even though they don’t have the typical white antennae. As such they will clean fish or dead scales and parasites. They also eat the pest anemone Aiptasia. On top of that they are great at cleaning out rocks. Their long legs (with claws on the ends) can get into places a hermit crab just can’t and because they have no shell they can move easily into cracks and behind rocks.
Caution: shrimp are known to take food from corals. Some shrimp are known to pick on corals. Some fish stores will sell camel shrimp either on purpose or by mistake and call them peppermint shrimp. Camel shrimp are not reef safe and should never be put in a reef tank.
Brittle starfish (1 per 25 gallons) – These black starfish are wonderful scavengers that hide in rocks and get into crevices.
Caution: these are not to be confused with the serpent stars with are not part of a clean up crew and require much different care and cautions.
Caution: a crab that doesn’t have enough food will find what he can. This may include your corals. Smaller crabs are usually fine, but as they get larger this can become an issue to watch out for. I only recommend introducing emeralds if you have a bubble algae problem. They are especially fond of eating green star polyps if they are within reach.
cerith snails (1 per 5 gallons) – these are algae eaters but what makes them special is that they 1. readily breed in the tank and 2. will actually dig a little into the sand to eat algae that isn’t at the surface. This allows them to get the algae off the glass that is just under the sand where you can’t scrape it.
nassarius snails (1 per 10-20 gallons with caution) – these guys are meat eaters. They are great at cleaning up leftover food and if a fish dies you will see these guys all over it. Their most unique property is that they live under the sand and only come out to feed. I call them zombie snails because when you put food in the tank they rise up out of the sand like so many zombies! This action is not only fun to watch, but it helps keep the sand turned over and cleaner.
Caution: Nassarius are members of the welk family which is the clue to us that they should be considered with caution. If you get too many of these snails you may end up having to feed them intentionally which negates the purpose of getting them in the first place.
nerite snails (1 per 3-5 gallons) – these are algae eaters. I like them because they are very small. I keep them in my refugium. They are able to get into areas that other snails can’t get. They can also be acclimated to freshwater though they can only breed in salt.
trochus (1 per 5 gallons) – this is your underwater goat! It eats algae like crazy, especially the longer kind. It really is a lawn mower. I like it, as mentioned above, because it is smaller than the turbo, doesn’t knock things over. I really don’t feel like my tank has enough algae to keep a turbo fed so the trochus is a better fit for my tank.
turbo snail (1 per 30-50 gallons) – These large snails often starve to death. Their appetite for algae is seldom met by a low nutrient system or a well maintained tank. I only keep these if I am placing them in a very mature system with plenty of natural algae for them. If they die in your tank their size is large enough to cause major water quality issues if not removed right away. I recommend the trochus snail over the turbo in most cases.
Caution: The turbo is a wonderful snail and few snails eat algae like they do, but that also means there must be plenty of algae so these should only be purchased with caution and for the right tank.

Wal-Mart Now Opening Primary Care Clinics in Texas and South Carolina With More To Come - Medical Quack '+l+"
What’s interesting is they don’t take insurance but will honor Medicare. I guess there has not bee enough time yet and most will be in rural areas. These clinics are set to monitor chronic care patients and do a bit more than the average retail clinic provides. In Texas United/Optum has now opened Urgent care clinics as well.
The clinics will be overseen by a physician but that does not mean they will be treating patients and could be covering more than one location. The primary care clinics will charge $40 a visit. BD
The company has opened five primary care locations in South Carolina and Texas, and plans to open a sixth clinic in Palestine, Texas, on Friday, with another six planned by the end of the year.
The clinics, it says, can offer a broader range of services, like chronic disease management, than the 100 or so acute care clinics leased by hospital operators at Walmarts across the country. Unlike CVS or Walgreens, which also offer some similar services, or Costco, which offers eye care, Walmart is marketing itself as a primary medical provider.
Like its competitors, Walmart is looking to grab a bigger share of the billions of health care dollars being spent in the United States and benefit from the shifting delivery system that has resulted from the Affordable Care Act.
The primary clinic model could offer some new advantages over the more basic clinics, often referred to as "retail clinics." The limited list of minor illnesses that a retail clinic can treat -- the flu, for instance -- often peaks in the winter months, Charland said, and slows down significantly at other times of year.
While it accepts Medicare, it does not currently accept third-party insurance, although it is exploring the option, a spokeswoman, Danit Marquardt, said, adding that it is starting to enroll some of its stores in Medicaid.

Student income, parental income and assets, and total family size are used to compute your Expected Family Contribution (EFC). Your EFC is included on your personal Student Aid Report (SAR), which spells out your anticipated college financial needs. Your SAR is shared with the schools you choose, where financial aid offices evaluate your eligibility for grants, loans, and other forms of student assistance. Your individual financial aid package, which often includes federal grants, is issued in a formal ‘offer letter’ from each university. Federal Grant For 9000
The Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program was created in 2007 through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act to provide financial assistance for teachers of high-demand fields who work in low-income schools. Eligible students can receive up to $4,000 per year. Low-income elementary and secondary schools are designated by the Department of Education. High-demand fields of study include foreign language, special education, math and science. If a student receives the TEACH grant and does not teach, the grant becomes a Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan. Free Money Jurassic World
Phone numbers can deceive. Some con artists use Internet technology to disguise their area code in caller ID systems. Although it may look like they’re calling from Washington, DC, they could be calling from anywhere in the world. You can't rely on caller ID because scammers know how to rig it to show you the wrong information (aka "spoofing"). Scammers might have personal information about you before they call, so don't take that as a sign they're the real thing. If you're not sure whether you're dealing with the government, look up the official number of the agency. Federal Grant Logo

We've all asked ourselves these big "what ifs" from time to time... What if you could just wish, and suddenly money would appear when you needed it? What if there was a secret source of cash that didn't require any work on your part to earn it? What if there was someone out there, somewhere, that cared enough about you to just hand you the money you wanted or needed?

The key economic idea undergirding this policy idea is something called aggregate demand, which, stated simply, is the total amount of spending in the economy. During a financial crisis, aggregate demand goes down, since newly unemployed workers have less money and people who manage to keep their jobs reduce their spending out of fear. When people spend less money, sales fall, and businesses are forced to lay off workers, who then spend even less money, and so on. In other words, money goes in circles: my spending is your income, and your spending is my income. If we all simultaneously cut back on our spending—if aggregate demand declines—then everybody’s income declines, too. That is, very crudely, what happened during the Great Depression, when there were millions of perfectly able workers desperate for jobs, while perfectly functional factories lay idle due to lack of customers. It’s also what has been happening, to a milder degree, in our economy since the 2008 crisis. Free Money Homeless
This is why income inequality is dangerous: it is a drag on aggregate demand. As inequality increases, as it has in the U.S., the drag grows commensurately. Stagnant wages mean that consumer borrowing must be steadily increased to keep the economy moving forward. Meanwhile, the fruits of growth flowing to the top mean a vast pile-up in savings and associated asset bubbles, and the recessions that follow are harder and harder to recover from. In other words, keeping an economy that suffers from galloping economic inequality pressurized and growing requires an economic policy regime that contains the seeds of its own destruction. And this leads us to where we are now: consumers today can’t stomach any more debt, interest rates have hit the floor, and a grinding, low-level depression is upon us. Welcome to 2014.

When it comes to receiving funds, all grants are divided into two generalized classifications, direct grants and pass-through grants. A direct grant means that the recipient receives the money directly from the federal government, with no intermediary in between. These grants are beneficial as there is no additional red tape to wade through - just a single application and subsequent agreement with the federal government. Federal Grant Closeout Procedures

The Federal Pell Grant Program provides need-based grants to low-income undergraduate and certain postbaccalaureate students to promote access to postsecondary education. Students may use their grants at any one of approximately 5,400 participating postsecondary institutions. Grant amounts are dependent on: the student's expected family contribution (EFC) (see below); the cost of attendance (as determined by the institution); the student's enrollment status (full-time or part-time); and whether the student attends for a full academic year or less.

Earmark grants are explicitly specified in appropriations of the U.S. Congress. They are not competitively awarded and have become highly controversial because of the heavy involvement of paid political lobbyists used in securing them. In FY1996 appropriations, the Congressional Research Service found 3,023 earmarks totaling $19.5 billion, while in FY2006 it found 12,852 earmarks totaling $64 billion.[3] Free Money No Pay Back

Currently this film has a 4.8 rating here at IMDb but in my opinion, VERY unjustly so! It teeters constantly between quirky, sweet humor, and macabre, almost cartoonish dark comedy. Which is to say, it's quintessential Brando. There's even a brief freeze-frame in the film of Brando with his hands flapping by his face in a 'neah-neah' gesture that is so 'Brandoesque'. He knows that his physical presence (a seemingly 500-pound ballet dancer) is a grand mixture of Father Christmas, Charlie Chaplin, Edward G. Robinson, and the man who bites off the heads of chickens at the circus. You just never know what you're going to get with him, so you - and the other characters in the film - are always kept a bit on edge (he played a somewhat similar character in "The Freshman"; another film that I've always thought was underrated).

Krugman is right that helicopter money isn’t fundamentally innovative economically. The argument here, however, is not economic; it’s institutional. Instead of Congress being in charge of distributing resources according to its erratic whims and halting ability to compromise, the Fed would do it. The Fed would watch aggregate demand closely (indeed, it already does this) and make quick, proactive decisions on whether to send everyone money, and how much, without having to wait for Congress to deliberate over a stimulus bill.

If you are just entering the realm of grants and government funding, it can feel overwhelming trying to find the right program for you or your organization. When considering grants, these programs can be broadly categorized as those awarded by the federal government and those awarded by non-federal entities. Within these two categories are a variety of funding sources and program types.
Essentially, a federal grant is an award of money or economic aid provided by the United States Government out of the funds available in the general federal revenue. The money provided can be a loan, a portion of a certain project or organization's cost, or a complete funding of a particular project, research or other undertaking. Grants are available from both the government as well as outside sources, (including foundations, non-profit charities or non-profit corporations), although the government alone offers nearly 1,000 different grant programs to qualified businesses and individuals, distributed by 26 grant-specific agencies, and divided into 21 separate categories.

If you are eligible for the Pell Grant you also qualify for the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (FSEOG) program. This grant is for undergraduates with the greatest unmet financial need. Eligible students receive between $100 and $4,000 depending on their school and Expected Family Contribution. The grant is distributed by your college, but is awarded to the college by the Federal Government. To participate in the FSEOG program, colleges must contribute one dollar for every three dollars of federal money. The FAFSA determines your eligibility, and some schools do not participate in the program. Federal Grant Administration

Federal and state grants frequently receive criticism due to what are perceived to be excessive regulations and not include opportunities for small business, as well as for often giving more money per person to smaller states regardless of population or need. These criticisms include problems of overlap, duplication, excessive categorization, insufficient information, varying requirements, arbitrary federal decision-making, and grantsmanship (a funding bias toward entities most familiar with how to exploit the system, rather than to those most in need).

In the decades since the Great Depression, we’ve managed to avoid another economic catastrophe of that magnitude by using these two tools to prop up aggregate demand. So why can’t we just use them again to boost us out of the slump in which we find ourselves now? The answer has to do with the inequality that has steadily increased in our society since the 1980s.

The availability of funding in any year depends on the federal budget and on the priorities of the federal agencies that run the grant competitions. Because of that, the amount of money available for federal grants to nonprofits is heavily influenced by the political environment, national concerns, and national events.

Right now, Congress has the power to directly spend its way to full employment, but it’s not doing it. And neither are the state governments. In fact, since 2010, Congress and most of the states have been doing the exact opposite, sharply reducing spending. After the Great Depression, it took World War II to break the political deadlock and get Congress to dump money into the economy, but today, nothing similarly jarring is in sight. If the Fed took over, it would respond directly to the needs of the economy, without getting bogged down in endless politically charged debates about the virtues of austerity or the moral peril of government checks (recall how Senate “moderates” forced the Obama stimulus to be too small). Instead, it could respond, quickly and efficiently, to fluctuations in aggregate demand. Free Money Rewards

The key economic idea undergirding this policy idea is something called aggregate demand, which, stated simply, is the total amount of spending in the economy. During a financial crisis, aggregate demand goes down, since newly unemployed workers have less money and people who manage to keep their jobs reduce their spending out of fear. When people spend less money, sales fall, and businesses are forced to lay off workers, who then spend even less money, and so on. In other words, money goes in circles: my spending is your income, and your spending is my income. If we all simultaneously cut back on our spending—if aggregate demand declines—then everybody’s income declines, too. That is, very crudely, what happened during the Great Depression, when there were millions of perfectly able workers desperate for jobs, while perfectly functional factories lay idle due to lack of customers. It’s also what has been happening, to a milder degree, in our economy since the 2008 crisis. Free Money North Carolina

Earmark grants are explicitly specified in appropriations of the U.S. Congress. They are not competitively awarded and have become highly controversial because of the heavy involvement of paid political lobbyists used in securing them. In FY1996 appropriations, the Congressional Research Service found 3,023 earmarks totaling $19.5 billion, while in FY2006 it found 12,852 earmarks totaling $64 billion.[3]
I know what you’re thinking: it would be crazy. Either it would be a fast track to crippling inflation or it’s some Republican satire of an ultra-liberal government handout program. But it is not quite as radical as it sounds. The key idea behind such a program has a longstanding, bipartisan economic pedigree. John Stuart Mill argued in 1829 that mass unemployment was caused by “a deficiency of the circulating medium” relative to other commodities. John Maynard Keynes used the idea in his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, to lampoon the inherent silliness of gold mining, suggesting that old coal mines could be filled up with bottles full of banknotes, buried over with trash, then left “to private enterprise on well-tried principles of laissez-faire to dig the notes up again.” Milton Friedman suggested that monetary policy could never fail to cure mass unemployment, because as a last resort the central bank could just drop cash out of helicopters—an enticing analogy that former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke borrowed in a 2002 speech, earning himself the persistent nickname of “Helicopter Ben.” Federal Grant Reporting Forms

Anyway, the train heist is merely a minor plot point, so I'm guessing that maybe that's why the movie bombed. Audiences were probably expecting a heist story with a solid, formula plot (probably along the scale of "Oceans Twelve"), and I'm guessing they felt extremely uncomfortable with the film's humble speed. The big-name cast also probably didn't help, because the film has a real 'Canadian provincial' feel to it (Hollywood, this film is not!). Nevertheless, the entire cast is fantastic; particularly Thomas Haden Church who I never would have guessed was the same guy in "Sideways"! Perhaps I'm just nuts, but I think this is a sleeper gem that has yet to find its true audience.
Having a handle on the basic definitions of federal grants as well as the restrictions or qualifications each grant type carries is a good start to being eligible for federal aid, regardless of an applicant's locale or ambition.

The fourth and final policy proposal on the table is what I’ll call the “helicopter money” option. It too is fairly simple. Under such a policy (which could be combined with aspects of the first three), every U.S. citizen would receive a regular payment, in the form of, say, a check from the Internal Revenue Service. The amount of each check would change depending on the health of the economy, but it could be fairly substantial during times of economic slack. To jar us out of our current slump, for instance, I’d start with payments on the order of $2,000 per person. These checks would arrive on an as-needed basis, depending on the state of the economy.

The helicopter money policy, by contrast, keeps government almost completely out of the picture. It distributes resources directly to citizens, with no limits on how they can spend it, thereby strengthening individual choice and the private sector, not government bureaucracies. It’s a stimulus Milton Friedman could love. And if everyone gets the same-sized check, there’s not even a concession to the god of progressivity—it’s like a flat tax in reverse! There will be a Republican president again someday, and as we’ve seen, it is highly likely that government will face the same weak growth and high unemployment we face today. This is a tool as friendly to the conservatives’ ideology as they are likely to find. Free Money Hacks 2018
Grant scammers generally follow a script: they congratulate you on your eligibility, then ask for your checking account information so they can “deposit your grant directly into your account,” or cover a one-time “processing fee.” The caller may even reassure you that you can get a refund if you’re not satisfied. In fact, you’ll never see the grant they promise; they will disappear with your money. Federal Housing Grant Programs

Enfield, Conn., May 1, 2015 — In honor of Mother’s Day, Radiology Associates of Hartford (RAH) is having a breast cancer screening brunch to help support the important women in everyone’s lives. Connecticut still has the unlucky distinction of having the second highest incidence of breast cancer in the U.S. As with any cancer, early detection is key. Regular yearly screening mammograms are the best tool for catching breast cancer at its earliest and most treatable stage. This event aims to make getting a mammogram more accessible by offering weekend appointments from 8:30 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, May 2 at RAH’s Enfield clinic – located at 9 Cranbrook Boulevard in Suite 102.
This event also makes the yearly health chore of getting a screening mammogram into a celebration of women’s health. In addition to offering state-of-the-art mammograms, RAH will be offering free made-to-order omelettes, mimosas, manicures, mini makeovers, professional bra fittings, blood pressure checks and goodie bags.
“Most women list a lack of time and anxiety about the results as the top reasons they skip their annual mammogram,” said Robert Perez, M.D. radiologist and breast imaging specialist at RAH. “Our hope is that by making getting a mammogram into a celebration more women will be inspired to be proactive about their health.”
Because of the number of women who attend, pre-registration is recommended for the event and can be made by calling 860-714-2724. For more information about the Mother’s Day Breast Cancer Screening Brunch or services available at RAH, visit www.rahxray.com or call 860-714-2724.

For over four decades, the name Scheuermann has been synonymous with baseball and athletics at Delgado Community College. The German name still lives on today at Delgado Community College and continues to make an everlasting difference.
Louis “Rags” Scheuermann was the founding father of the Delgado's intercollegiate athletic department and baseball program of DCC in the early 70s. Scheuermann started playing baseball as a child in the street, playing in his socks and raggy clothes and from then on was referred to as “Rags.” The name followed him all throughout his baseball career as a professional player for the Boston Red Sox and later the Chicago Cubs. After a recurring arm injury, “Rags” retired and went into coaching.
He served as the Head Coach at Loyola University but when the university dropped its athletic department in the early 1970s he came to Delgado and started its athletic department, serving as The Dolphins head baseball coach and also the athletic director.
His hard work and dedication compelled the team to earn eight district championships and a trip to the Junior College World Series. Some of his players went on to play in the Major Leagues. During this time, he also served as the league director of of the New Orleans Boosters for forty-five years and is still considered the longest tenured manager in AAABA (All American Amateur Baseball Association) history. In 1990, he was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.
Shortly thereafter, during his Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame induction speech, “Rags” retired as Head Coach and became the college's director of intramural sports until his death in 1997. After his retirement, his son Joe Scheuermann succeeded him as head coach.
Joe Scheuerman is presently in his 22nd season of coaching and has considered Delgado his home away from home. He began his journey with Delgado as an athlete straight out of high school, playing under the coaching of his father.
He then went on to play baseball for Tulane University after completing two years of school at Delgado. He has seen many changes over the years at the school, not only in the baseball program, but throughout the College as a whole. “We have continued to build the program into one of the finest in junior college baseball across the country. Our facility has grown and expanded to become one of the best around, while also being a beautiful place to call home.” In addition, “The growth of the college and its enrollment over the years has been astonishing,” said Scheuermann.
One of the reasons Delgado is like his home away from home is its family-like atmosphere, according to Scheuermann. He said, “For being such a large college, the faculty, staff, and students still know one another and care about each other. Our baseball program echoes that family atmosphere with the majority of our players coming from Southeast Louisiana.”
Joe was inducted into the AAABA Hall of Fame in 2007 and continues to lead the Dolphins in victory. In 2011, the Dolphins captured their 700th win with Scheuermann as their coach. He continues to work hard like his father and when asked about the impact of his father’s legacy, he remembers how many lives he touched over the many years he coached. “I continue to try to maintain the respect that “Rags” got around the community and still live by many of the lessons and values that he taught me on and off the baseball field,” said Scheuermann.
Now, Joe has a son of his own aiding him in carrying on the tradition of the family name known throughout the Delgado and surrounding communities. Tyler Scheuermann is a third-generation Scheuermann working with the baseball and athletic program at Delgado.
Tyler is a recent graduate of Delgado, earning his Associates Degree in Journalism and Public Relations last May. He serves the college's Sports Information Officer and helps to oversee Delgado's baseball operations, which consist of a lot of off-field responsibilities to assist the coaches and players.
Tyler also writes media stories for the men and women’s basketball teams, the baseball team, markets the baseball team, and advertises for the baseball program, including the athletic website.
“It’s a good feeling to keep our family tradition alive. Obviously, the Scheuermanns have a lot of years under their belt at Delgado, so there is a bit of name recognition involved. I’m not pressured by the name, I just try to live up to everything it stands for both at Delgado and throughout the community,” said Tyler.
In honor of his many years of service and dedication in Delgado athletics and baseball, in 2003, Kirsch-Rooney Stadium named the field after “Rags” Scheuermann and it is now known as “Rags” Scheuermann Field at Kirsch-Rooney Stadium. Joe Scheuermann says of this honor, “By the field bearing his name, it’s a constant reminder of his impact on New Orleans baseball, and that his name resonates with those playing there [Kirsch-Rooney] today. His legacy lives on not only on the field, but in the many lives he touched off the field as well.”
Both Joe and Tyler want their family name to live on at Delgado, and like his father, Tyler has no plans on leaving the baseball team anytime soon. Tyler plans to continue doing what he does now while pursuing a bachelor's degree in sports management or mass communications. In addition, the entire Scheuermann Family continues to operate Kirsch-Rooney and maintain a strong presence in the Delgado Baseball family today.
“I hope to be Delgado’s baseball coach for years to come. At my age, I hope to be here as long as possible and have given no real thought as to who would replace me…hopefully that’s a long way off,” said Joe Scheuermann.

Harper Dáithi Ó Murchadha (David Murphy) composed this march for his patron Theobald Bourke (Lord Mayo, 1681-1741) of Castlebar, County Mayo.
Mount Cisco is a town in Westchester County, north of New York City. This reel is a very popular session tune. Frank learned it from Uilleann Piper Walter Lelle.
As a young lad Saoirse remembers watching Tommy Makem doing this on RTÉ television. The instrumentals included are ‘The Cobbler’ (Jig) and ‘I buried my wife and danced on top of her’.
This song written by english musician Peter Hames was made popular by the Irish bard Christy Moore. It relates the story of one of the greatest problems of our time: unemployment. A strong and passionate songwriter ballad filled with despair and anger.
Showacho is a train station in Osaka, Japan. This tune was composed by Inverness Piper Roddy (R.S.) MacDonald. Frank also learned this one from Walter Lelle.
A traditional Irish song which originates from the Gaeltacht region in the north-west of County Donegal, which is usually taught to young children at school (so to Saoirse). The lyrics are in the Gaelic, and it is based on the immortalisation of a small boat owned by a man called Feilimí (Phelim).
Brenda Stubbert is a well known Cape Breton Fiddler. The Reel was composed by Jerry Holland, also a famous Cape Breton fiddler.
This tune might originally have come over from Scotland. It was one of Uilleann Piper Willie Clancy’s favourite tunes.
This traditional jig is named after fiddler James Morrison (1893-1947). Morrison was born near Riverstown, Co. Sligo, and emigrated to New York, where he did the first recording of this tune in the 1930's.
A song written by Irish singer/songwriter Sonny Condell, member of the Irish bands 'Tír na nÓg' and 'Scullion'. Saoirse had the pleasure of seeing Scullion live at the height of their popularity in the late seventies.
‘Star of the County Down’ is an old Irish ballad set near Banbridge in County Down. The words have been written by Cathal McGarvey (1866-1927), from Ramelton, County Donegal. The tune of the song is much older and can be found in 18th century Scottish documents.
‘Siúil a Rúin’ is a tradtional Irish song lamenting a departed love. The song has english language verses and an Irish language chorus. We learned this song from the Clannad album ‘Dúlamán’.
A 65th minute victor by the Irons' Manuel Lanzini means the title is all but Chelsea's. A 1-0 loss at West Ham enables Chelsea to secure the trophy before Tottenham even plays again.
Pochettino admitted Spurs lacked the intensity they had shown in recent games, but rubbished suggestions that the pressure had got to his players.
Manuel Lanzini's second half strike ensured West Ham the points, and indeed their Premier League status, as well as nearly certainly putting pay to Tottenham's title hopes in the process.
West Ham, the first team to stop Tottenham scoring since Liverpool in early February, moved up to ninth with 42 points and are now mathematically safe. It is true that it will be hard. That has disappointed us a lot, but this is football and we need to understand this was a hard game, we tried but it was impossible.
Instead, the defeat that Chelsea can extend the gap to seven points with a win against Middlesbrough on Monday - and should they do that, beating West Brom next Friday night will seal the title for the Blues. Tottenham's challenge now is holding on for its highest finish in 54 years in the remaining three games.
As they had done for most of the game, the Hammers nullified every attempt by Tottenham to breach their defence after that, and could have won by a bigger margin had they been more clinical. "I don't know. But you have to win".
Last month, Lloris told ESPN FC that "a winning mentality is already in place" at Tottenham but immediately after the game he rejected suggestions that fatigue was to blame and said his teammates had not gone the extra mile.
Pochettino's players were looking lethargic and were punished for their sloppiness in the 65th minute. "Now is the time rest, to analyse the game and be ready for the next time". 'We have to wait but are thinking that it will be hard to catch Chelsea.
West Ham turned on the style to foil a Tottenham side usually so energetic and menacing to ease any lingering relegation fears.
Gulf Arab states are optimistic about Trump whom they see as a hawkish leader opposed to their adversary Iran. He will also hold talks in Rome with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and President Sergio Mattarella.
On " The Herd with Colin Cowherd ", though, things got testy once Kristine Leahy asked him how many sneakers he had sold. Loud person and increasingly probable bozo LaVar Ball's latest trick isn't a great one. "She scares me to death".
In his opening monologue, he faked a disastrous big musical number before breaking out a Hamilton-style preview of the evening. The English comedian has showed his own singing skills in the popular Carpool Karaoke segment on his chat show.
A US official who confirmed the disclosure to The Associated Press said the revelation potentially put the source at risk. The Flynn investigation was part of a broader probe into Russian interference in last year's presidential election.
Ridley Scott returns to the universe he created, with ALIEN: COVENANT , a new chapter in his groundbreaking ALIEN franchise. I was disappointed that Covenant's xenomorphs just look like skinny fetuses, instead of bats or werewolves.
He also suggested accuracy might be improved by handing out written responses rather than holding press briefings. Here is a timeline of explanations provided by the White House and the President since Tuesday .
The company's consensus rating is now Strong Buy, with 10 analysts rating it a Strong Buy, and 9 analysts rating it with a Hold. Coldstream Capital Management Inc. boosted its stake in shares of Advanced Micro Devices by 2.8% in the fourth quarter.
This ratio also gives some idea of whether you're paying too much for what would be left if the company went bankrupt immediately. RFG Advisory Group LLC bought a new stake in shares of FelCor Lodging Trust during the fourth quarter worth about $138,000.
The team said in a statement that Thomas had two other damaged teeth that required "extensive oral surgery to stabilize". PG John Wall has finished with at least 20 points and seven assists in all 10 of Washington's playoff games this season.
The Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Co-ordination Centre said 2,000 computers at 600 companies in Japan had been affected. Experts and governments alike warn against ceding to the demands and Wainwright said few victims so far had been paying up.
Gomez's label Interscope reportedly played the track for David Byrne who, according to a source, liked the track so much he gave authority for its use.
SRB Corp acquired a new position in shares of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp during the third quarter worth about $136,000. The stock of PNC Financial Services Group Inc (NYSE:PNC) earned "Equalweight" rating by Barclays Capital on Monday, July 18.
Basildon Hospital was not affected by the malware, but as a precaution has taken steps to protect its internal IT systems. Businesses and the public are supposed to constantly update their computers with the latest patches and software updates.
The USF men's golf team put forward a fairly disappointing effort this week in the Baton Rouge Regional of the NCAA Tournament . Baylor earned the seventh NCAA Championships berth in program history - 1960, 1966, 1967, 2002, 2010, 2016 and 2017.
It was a typically thorough performance from James, who right now is playing with a singular mix of command and poise and craft. The extra time off certainly did something for James during the regular season when he took a few games to get a little R&R.
Beijing has asked the deployment be canceled because of THAAD's powerful radar and regional surveillance capabilities. Moon was sworn is as South Korea's new President on Wednesday after his victory in Tuesday's presidential election.
Comey said he replied that "I agree he is a good guy" but said nothing to Trump about limiting the investigation. Authorities said Russian Federation meddled in November's election to benefit Trump.
The accused gunman was held by passengers until police arrived. "Everybody on the train was upset", she said. In a statement, Amtrak said the conductor sustained a non-life-threatening wound.
Before he could respond, the officer, identified as Oliver, fired three shots into the vehicle , striking Edwards' in the head. Both Merritt and Crockett have credited Haber for correcting the mistaken statement and moving quickly to fire Oliver.
The dinosaur, they found, could chow down with about 8,000 lbf (35,586 N), more than twice the force of a saltwater croc. Wolves and hyenas, for example, are also able to crush bones with their teeth, accessing nutritious marrow.
North Korea says it has no choice but to advance its nuclear and missile development to defend itself from attack. On May 14 (May 13 EDT in the U.S.), the DPRK did a new - and successful - launch of a ballistic missile.
It said it believed the difficulties are linked to the global cyberattack but they haven't so far harmed its business operations. But Dr Anne Rainsberry, national incident director at NHS, said there were "encouraging signs" the situation was improving .

Yesterday I had the honor of attending a test flight at the U.S. Coast Guard Training Center, Cape May, New Jersey. The flight is part of a program run by Dr. Michael Chumer at the New Jersey Institute of Technology that is researching how to use data-collection sensors on UAS for homeland security and emergency management functions. While NJIT is part of the Virginia Tech Test site’s Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership (MAAP), a group of over 50 institutions, they independently sought and obtained a Certificate of Waiver or Authorization (COA) from the FAA for this current program.
It took over a year for NJIT to obtain the COA, and it was clear from the moment I arrived that the COA had placed significant requirements on NJIT. One of my first posts was to explain why I use the term UAS, as opposed to drone or UAV. It was clear today that UAS is the proper term, because the aerial vehicle is just a small part of the overall system – the team estimated that the aircraft is only 20% of the overall system! Dr. Chumer introduced me to the Emergency Operations Center (EOC), housed in an RV and provided by Cape May County. There was also a flight center in a mobile military-style vehicle and this is where the pilot and other flight crew were based. EMT personnel were present and a number of members from an FAA research group who are helping to develop the R&D necessary to promulgate UAS regulations were present. I arrived 45 minutes before takeoff, and they were already well into busy flight preparations – this is not your fly out of the box DJI Phantom.
COA’s are only issued to public entities under the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, which provided some logistical hurdles. NJIT does not own the RS-16, the unmanned aircraft that flew yesterday. It was leased from its developer, American Aerospace, which as a private entity cannot obtain a COA. NJIT then also hired American Aerospace to provide the trained pilots necessary for the flight. The RS-16 is an gas-powered 85 lb aircraft with a 12 foot wingspan, 15,000 ft ceiling and 25 lb payload. It’s maximum speed is 65 knots, with a cruising speed of 55 knots and stall speed of 31 knots. The RS-16 is developed with civilian technology, which helps it avoid the ITAR issues surrounding military UAS (I do not know enough information to determine the ECCN, but this is sufficient to allow me to comfortably post images from the test flight).
UPDATE: I’ve been able to confirm that at least one internal component is Cat VIII on the ITAR. As for the rest of the system, I do not have enough information to make a determination.
Yesterday’s flight was limited to a ceiling of 3,000 ft and a range of 1 NM from the takeoff location. Except for the fact that there was no passenger compartment, one would have thought this was a manned flight. There were fully qualified pilots – one who was the Pilot-in-Command and two to act as ground observers. The pilot was in constant communication with Air Traffic Control, had filed NOTAM’s with the FAA to advise other aviators about the flight, and received clearance from ATC prior to take-off. The ground observers are necessary to comply with FAA “sense-and-avoid” requirement, which is the requirement that an aircraft have first-hand situational awareness of its environment and be able to avoid other aircraft. This is accomplished with UAS by either having ground observers who are trained pilots, that can have eyes on the aircraft even when the PIC is looking at his controls, or by having a “chase aircraft,” a manned aircraft with eyes on the UAS. For this flight, ground observers were sufficient, but the COA will eventually allow NJIT to fly up to 10,000 ft and out to 14.5NM over the Atlantic. At that point a chase aircraft will be necessary. It might seem odd that a UAS with 25 lbs of sensors needs human eyes on its surroundings, but until the FAA is satisfied that sensors can comply with sense-and-avoid requirements, this will be required.
Dr. Edward Mahoney, the Mayor of Cape May and Gerald Thornton, the Freeholder Director of Cape May County discussed the potential they see in UAS. They hope that UAS will help in disaster situations to aid people stranded and then to survey damage, such as if another Hurricane Sandy occurs, or to help ground personnel in more traditional emergencies such as those that fire and EMT personnel respond to. They heard numerous concerns from citizens about privacy issues as well, but assured residents that this is not being for the aforementioned research purposes and not as a police surveillance tool. They also hope that by leading the R&D effort they will attract UAS industry to southern New Jersey – a very astute and forward-thinking position and they would eventually like to open up a local airport for UAS operations. A number of people, including the FAA research group, had questions about the liabilities one might face for using a UAS. As you know, this is a long and complicated topic, and not the primary purpose of the test fight, but it was good to see that people were thinking about these issues.
Now for the flight, the exciting part. The RS-16 does not have wheels, and like many fixed wing UAS it is launched off of a catapult-looking device. The flight crew took a good amount of time testing it in the apparatus before flight, and started the propeller like in the old days (although now there is a device that helps spin it rather than the images of WWII crew doing it by hand). We all had to stand back behind a pre-determined point from the 15 minutes prior to take-off, a very strict requirement as part of the COA. The catapult launched it into the air for a successful take-off and the research began. It stayed within the predetermined area and we went into the EOC both to get warm and see the equipment that was receiving flight data. The computer has the capability to link via VPN to numerous emergency agencies and receives real-time data, including high-qualify imagery, from the RS-16. Two people from Avwatch were present with a mobile Dismount User Kit (DUK). It was designed for special forces units and looks like a bullet-proof vest with a mini iPad on it (it’s actually a Samsung). This device receives the same imagery as the computer alongside a map noting the location of the aircraft, the pilot, and the various DUK users. I have photos of this, but since it was designed for military purposes I’m concerned that it might be ITAR regulated and will refer you to their website.
The pilot, Michael Cancienne. He was like a star of sorts. He was in the flight center for most of the pre-flight, and when he emerged everyone was vying for a photo. He did a great job piloting!
After about 30 minutes in the air, the RS-16 came down for a landing. We all had to stand well back from the runway and were told to speak up if we say anything of concern. Remember that it doesn’t have wheels? It still doesn’t for landing. While David Yoel, the Founder and CEO of American Aerospace, had full faith in his pilot, he took a big sigh of relief when it skidded to a safe landing on its second pass – a brief gust of wind caught the wing on the first pass and the pilot wanted to be safe!
Today I wanted to write about UAS regulations in other countries, and recent news fit in perfectly with that plan. Puy du Fou, the second largest theme park in France, has announced that it will be including UAS in its nighttime Cinéscénie. I hadn’t heard about this place until today, but it already looks quite extravagant. Their webpage about the 3 kg “Neopter” says they are custom created to be waterproof and they can be choreographed together. The Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile Française (DGAC) has authorized Puy du Fou to fly the Neopters.
France is clearly more willing to allow UAS use than the United States, and they have set up a tiered system for the weight of the UAS along with the situation in which it is being used. Even small recreational users must take various safety precautions that are similar to the small UAS regulations proposed by UAS American Fund. As the weight and proximity to people increases, the users must take more action. For those who understand French, the regulations are here. I haven’t been able to find reliable English translations, so rather than go through line-by-line, please email me if you have any questions and I’ll do my best to translate.
The theme in all of these countries is that small UAS are generally permitted with some limitations, but commercial use is possible without the difficult 333 Exemption process adhered to by the FAA. I’ve only summarized the requirements, but I hope this gives you a flavor of what other countries are doing – and why R&D is heading there.
Canada: They have a great site that is very user-friendly. There are two general exemptions, one for UAS less than 2 kg and one for those 2-25kg.
The 2-25 kg exemption is similar, but contains stricter requirements for pilot training and UAS system requirements
Generally, UAS under 20 kg are exempt from most requirements with the caveats below. Above that weight, both the aircraft and pilot will need to be certified.
No permissions or certifications are required if the UAS is (1) <20 kg, (2) not being used commercially, and (3) not being flown in a congested area.
Pilots are required to obtain an Operator’s Certificate – not as arduous as the US’s Private Pilot’s License for 333 Exemptions.
United Arab Emirates: I include this because of UAS flying near the airport in Dubai grounded air traffic for almost an hour yesterday. I couldn’t find the actual regulations, but the official news agency says that one must have permission from the Dubai Civil Aviation Authority in order to use a UAS in Dubai. There are also strict privacy laws that forbid the taking of another’s picture without their permission. So do your research before taking aerial photos in Dubai, or anywhere else for that matter.
Also note that in the European Union, a recent case from the Court of Justice of the European Union found that photographs constitute personal data. Under the EU Data Protection Directive, each country within the EU must pass laws protecting personal data. So even if one is operating a UAS in the GB or in France under the exemptions listed, taking photographs of people in public is still prohibited!
Hobbico announced a new UAV, the ORA, at CES 2015. It has a 1080p HD camera and a 7″ OLED touchscreen as part of the transceiver (which operates at 5.8 GHz for better reliability). The OLED will undoubtedly give the screen great readability regardless of the sun. The ORA has a return to home feature, programmable GPS waypoints, and even a parachute – according to the video below. It sounds like it has integrated performance and safety in one unit.
I have had my eye on the Parrot Bepop, but the Sky Controller is not on the market. I’ve also been looking at the Phantom 2 Vision +, but the price tag is high. By the way, all there of these UAVs are export controlled, so don’t plan to take it overseas with you.
It is an interesting name, and one report had it as the “Aura,” but best I can tell it is the ORA. Hobbico does not have the specs, release date, or price on their website but I’ll keep an eye on it. It is expected early this year.

Clinc is expanding its focus on fintech into new verticals that could take advantage of its conversational artificial intelligence. The Ann Arbor-based company recently took the wraps off its new system that aims to provide quick-service restaurants like McDonald’s and Taco Bell with a voice assistant in the drive-through window.
I got a demo of the new system. For the most part, even in its early state, it works as advertised. Want a double cheeseburger without pickles and mayo with a side of fries and a Coke? With Clinc’s system, a person can order food as if they were talking to a human. Have questions or want to make changes to the order? Again, the person ordering the food does not have to modify their speech pattern or use a voice menu tree — just talk to the system normally.

“I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to what light I have.” Abraham Lincoln, 1854.
In 1849, after serving one term as a US Congressman, and with no political prospects, it looked like Lincoln would be relegated to the dust bin of history. He resigned himself to the life of a travelling lawyer (a circuit rider). Although he was extremely good at his job, he probably felt despair that his desire for a life in politics was beyond his reach.
In 1854, Lincoln’s life changed dramatically. Under the guidance of his long-time rival,Senator Stephan Douglas, Congress passed the Kansas-Nebraska Act, a law which repealed the Missouri Compromise of 1820, and changed the way that slavery was dealt with in the United States. Under the Missouri Compromise, slavery was essentially bottled up and restricted to the 13 southern states.
The Kansas-Nebraska Act allowed slavery to expand into the new territories of Kansas and Nebraska, as well as to any other state, based on a majority vote. Lincoln, and other residents of northern states, were outraged that the evil of slavery could now spread like cancer to other states.
Lincoln was awakened like a sleeping giant. To stop this injustice became Lincoln’s all consuming passion.
A carefully crafted speech delivered in New York City, in 1860, propelled Lincoln onto the national stage like a hurricane, and established him as a credible Republican candidate for the presidency.
If you can tie your deepest feelings to the thing that you do with your life, then you are following in Lincoln’s footsteps, and your life has true meaning.
Deep inside, I knew that I was more than just someone doomed to spend my life working an 8:00 to 5:00 job. I felt I had untapped skills and potential to write books and to be a public speaker. I started writing books in 2007, in my spare time, while working my regular job. My big opportunity came when I was laid off from my job, in 2010, and I was able to channel my energies into a writing and speaking career.
Focusing on Abraham Lincoln was an easy choice for me. He had long been a hero for me. As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Honduras in 1987, I read Carl Sandberg’s epic book, “Abraham Lincoln.” It was the greatest book I had ever read about the greatest man who had ever lived. It awakened in me the desire to both, become a writer, and to draw closer to Lincoln.
I am a short, skinny, balding, hair color enhanced 63-year-old former Peace Corps Volunteer. Abraham Lincoln is a human quote factory. Everything he said is either inspirational, insightful, or funny. Connecting with Abraham Lincoln is the best thing that ever happened to me.
When a radio host asked singer Don McLean, “What is the meaning of your song American Pie?” He replied, “It means that I never have to work again.”
In my case, linking my life with Abraham Lincoln does not mean that I never work again. However, my job is doing what I love most, to help individuals to “Lincoln-ize” their existence. I exhort others to fuse their spirit to that of Lincoln, and in so doing, to live a life filled with passion and purpose.

You are already leading, just that not always. Situations, environment and people involved decide whether you want to lead or follow. As person you are born with nothing, you are nurtured by your family and the world around to become something. That’s what you are today. From here to where is in your hands. Leadership has to come from within…
To be a great captain M S Dhoni led his team to win all type of formats of cricket, to make a Maratha Kingdom Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj started with a few friends, to be the Prime Minister of India Narendra Modji led from the front and many more examples can just come in front of your eyes. Leadership training for them was from different teachers and loved ones. All those moments when you have achieved a success personally or with a teamwork is when you either led yourself or your team in the right direction.
People have typical style of leadership, they use the same with everyone and everywhere. This is a major reason of failure as they are not taught nor they have attend any leadership training course.
Different people need different type of leadership, to understand this Furute has a one of its type leadership development program which gives team building training, leadership training for managers, business leadership training. Behavioural problems, not technical skills, are what separate the great from the near great. The first step to change is wanting to change. So if you really want to get the leader in you to work, just be with us and see and feel the Leadership of Ashay Shah in creating a true successful leader in you…
When we have an agreement on our Do and Don’ts we are peaceful and progressive. To achieve the right agreement you need to be a great negotiator. This applies in personal and professionals life.
What is negotiation? It is a conversation or a discussion through which we want to create a win-win situation for all involved parties. It sounds a bit technical but it is a part of our everyday routine. We knowingly or unknowingly keep on negotiating with one person or the other.
When your alarm is blazing in your ears and you tell yourself, “Let me sleep for 5 more minutes”, what are you doing? You are negotiating with yourself. Your lazy self and your disciplined self are trying to reach on an agreement which is acceptable to both. When you are running late for office but your mom wants you to eat something first, and then you promise her that you will grab a bite before reaching office is a negotiation between you and your mom. When your loved one ask you for a new bike and you says, “I will buy you a new bike if you achieve this or that”, it is a negotiation between your loved one and you.
When you go to a shop to buy something, what happens between you and the salesperson is negotiation. When sales target is being discussed in the office meeting that is a negotiation between you and your team. And I can go on and on about what is negotiation
Negotiation is a very routine part of our life so we should be a master of negotiation skills. But sadly that is not the case. We may be able to negotiate very well with a few friends, family members and clients. But when we face some one smarter or tougher, something snaps, something happens and Bam!! We lose the deal because we lack effective negotiation skills and don’t know advanced negotiation skills
Everyone has a style of negotiation, and they use the same everywhere. Negotiation is an art to be learnt and practiced. To be an ace negotiator we need to understand the mental and emotional personality of people we are dealing with.
Furute has designed this training program to help people to develop effective negotiation skills. People search for sales negotiation training or business negotiation training or negotiation skills in sales or sales and negotiation training on internet. We at Furute have analysed these searches and so come with a customized unique training program for Businessman, Professionals, CEO’s, Business heads, Sales managers and Sales heads, Purchase managers, Corporates and anyone looking to be great effective negotiator…

The situation in Gaza Strip will go back in crisis again if a number of issues are not resolved. Issues like security control and other files need to be resolved such as salaries, employees and Hamas relations with regional bodies such as Iran and Turkey. High-level diplomatic sources told PNN
The most prominent of these files now is the Rafah boarder crossing, which was supposed to be worked with today and it will not be open for passengers in the Strip because the situation is still escalating in the sector.
The Rafah border crossing will not open today or soon before a solution is found to matters like security control to ensure that no security related problems occur leading to negative results, a source who wished to remain anonymous told PNN.
The European Union told the Palestinian Authority (PA), Egypt and other international bodies that the European Union will not be able to send observers and officers to Rafah boarder crossing without resolving its matter and the security control, which could endanger the lives of European observers at any moment.
The European Union, in its letters to the PA, Egypt and international bodies, said that it is not possible to go back to the 2005 agreement regarding the operation of the crossing because the conditions were different then and the division and control of Hamas over the years led to many changes. Adding that this file and and the security control has not yet been resolved in the Palestinian reconciliation therefore it would be impossible to send European observers to the crossing to operate at this moment.
The European Union hoped that the reconciliation meetings in Cairo had resolved the issue of security control in the Gaza Strip. The European Union also hopes that Egypt who sponsored the reconciliation will establish a vision and a security plan to ensure the success of the reconciliation efforts to restore stability in such a way as to ensure the return of observers. The source added.
On the other hand, the source pointed out that the other crisis, which is another obstacle in the situation is the salary crisis, as Israel said that it will deduct the value of salaries of Gaza employees of the tax revenues if the PA decides to integrate Hamas civil and military personnel in the lists of employees. This means a salary crisis on the Palestinian side. This is in addition to the fact that Hamas did not pay the salaries of employees from its own budget, which indicates a new financial crisis for Palestinians in Gaza Strip, therefore this will lead to further escalation in the situation in Gaza, according to diplomatic sources.
Another reason for the possibility of a crisis in Gaza Strip is Hamas leaders visits to several countries, including Iran and Turkey, which have different programs and visions of the Egyptian vision. These visits have embarrassed the Egyptian mediator in reconciliation. Egypt saw Hamas accepting and responding to the Egyptian role. but Hamas’ recent visits especially to Tehran and the statements embarrassed the Egyptian mediator, leading them to delay the opening of the crossing and perhaps take further steps towards Hamas.
According to the sources, Egypt has decided to postpone the opening of the Rafah crossing because it is the one who decides to open it or not not in the first place. Now Egypt demands Hamas to provide clarifications regarding their relations with the countries of the region.
V6 English News > News > National News > Gold falls ahead of US presidential election / November 9, 2016
New York (IANS) Gold futures on the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange dropped on Tuesday, as investors largely waited on the sidelines ahead of the results of the US presidential election.
The most active gold contract for December delivery fell $4.9, or 0.38 per cent, to settle at 1,274.50 dollars per ounce, Xinhua news agency reported.
The metal dropped nearly 2 per cent in its previous session after the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said no criminal charges were warranted against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton for using a private email server.
Investors were largely expecting a victory for Clinton and noted that a market shock — similar to the gains the day after the UK voted to leave the European Union (EU) — was expected if Republican nominee Donald Trump takes the White House.
In the day following the British vote to leave the EU, gold prices rallied more than 6 per cent as investors bought up so-called safe haven assets, including the dollar and the Chinese yen.
Markets also remained cautious of the implications of the US election outcome on an anticipated interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve next month.
The double uncertainty over the election and the possible US interest rate hike have boosted demand for gold and silver in the US, dealers said.

Yet another finished piece of black and white art from Zeus. Here, after traveling to the depths of Tartaros to free his uncles, the Cyclopes, from bondage, Zeus is gifted by those same uncles with his birthright. It looks kind of painful, doesn't it?
Another page of finished Black and White from Zeus. Sequentially, this page takes place right before the color-tryout page I did a while back-- Check the side links under Zeus to see that. Zeus has approached his father Kronos in disguise as an old woman, but Kronos sees him for who he is. I really enjoy that as soon as Zeus makes his big reveal his big moment gets cut short by his dad just "whhomp" grabbing him up in his hand. Poor Zeus.
Above is a finished black-and-white page from my upcoming graphic novel on the life and times of Zeus, king of the gods. This particular scene actually takes place before the birth of Zeus, right after his father, the Titan Kronos, has taken a sickle to his own father, Zeus' granpa, the Sky (also called Ouranos, or Uranus). The blood of Ouranos rains down over the Earth (Zeus' grandma, by the way), and everywhere it touches, new life comes forth. From left to right, we see the birth of the gigantes, the nymphs, the Furies, and in the final panel, a puffy pink cloud that will eventually form into Aphrodite, goddess of love.
Oh, and a big published thank you in Zeus to anyone who can help me think of a suitable subtitle for this book. I think Zeus is a fine title , but it just needs a little something else...

Biology is a discipline about life. This term is taken from the Dutch language “biologie”, which is also derived from the Greek language, bios (“life”) and logos (“science”). From long time ago until 1970, the term “ilmu hayat” is used, taken from Arabian language, literally means science of life.
The scope of discussion of biology is very wide and includes all the organisms. Some branches from biology are popular including botany, zoology and microbiology. Various aspects of life are discussed. Physical properties are learnt in anatomy, its function in physiology, behavior in etology (both evolutionary biology and palaeobiology), and inheritance of properties in genetics. Currently there is even astrobiology that learns about the possibilities about other being in other planets. The development of technology has enabled research in level of molecular building block of organism as well as biochemistry that supported through computational technique in bioinformatics.
Biology had been developed much in the 19th century, when scientists suggested that organism has the core characteristics. Biology is now become the core subject in schools and universities all over the world, with thousands of scientific writing are made every year in biological and medical journals. Healthcare service in the laboratory of Department of Biology includes service in reproduction (Andrology, Immunology Reproduction), Human Genetics, Cell and Molecular Biology.

For this project we have three distinct stages of data processing which we have called the Processing, Visualization, and Analyses stages, as also noted by the links in the navigation bar above. Data processing deals with the videos and imagery from the mobile eye-tracking systems and the panorama capture systems. Data visualization is where we develop tools, diagrams, and methodologies for working with all of our imagery, eventually in the hopes of developing a virtual field-trip experience. The data analyses are where we focus on probability, statistics, data metrics, and machine-learning procedures in the search for patterns and distinctions among, and between, our novice and expert geoscience subjects (observers on the field trip).
Data analyses are currently in-development, but we have begun to research applications of classical Recurrence Analysis, through the work of Ph.D. Candidate Tommy P. Keane. This work is in progess, but some free-to-use code and diagrams can be found below. The most recent publication at ETRA 2014 details the general development of statistical metrics for classical Recurrence Analysis and contrasts it against the trend of applications in eye-tracking analyses which we would like to more precisely refer to as Reoccurrence Analyses. Again, these are works that are still in development, but these introductory publications and the provided code may still prove of some use.
Errata: On page 147, left column, second paragraph, the sentence beginning “You will notice further down in Algorithm...” is a typo. This sentence should have been removed between the reviewed and final drafts, since the algorithm referenced was also removed from the paper during the blind review rounds. Sorry for any confusion.
Provided is a zip archive containing open-source (free to use, share, and modify with attribution please, though no assumed affiliation) python code files, an example image, and example data for computing and visualizing Recurrence Analysis and Reoccurrence Analysis as discussed in the publication. The computations are in their own modules so that they can be incorporated into other software. This is a prototype while we are developing optimized Cython code and integrating these methods into our mobile eye-tracking data viewing/analysis framework. Header comments in all files provide email information for sending any questions or comments. Thank you!
Implemented in python (RecurrenceReoccurrenceViewer.py), the GUI requires matplotlib, Qt, and PySide, but the data processing code itself is provided as two separate modules which can be used directly. The data is assumed to be integers or floats inside python lists instead of depending upon numpy.
This code has not been optimized and is provided as-is. Feel free to contact Tommy P. Keane for questions, comments, or help.

Archaeologist Believes He Has Found the Remains of Sodom and Gomorrah, Bolstering Accuracy of Genesis
"Such a discovery would be one of the most important Biblically-related archaeological finds in history," Dr. Steven Collins said last year
Dr. Steven Collins' excavation at Tall al-Hammam has reportedly uncovered "massive destruction dated to the 18th and 19th centuries B.C., a time traditionally associated with the patriarch Abraham and his nephew, Lot. More significantly, the archaeological layer atop the destruction reveals no evidence of human habitation; there are no pottery shards or remains of buildings or walls for about 700 years, possibly indicating that the area was seen as cursed or uninhabitable following its obliteration."
Collins, director of the Tall el-Hammam Excavation Project in Jordan and dean of the college of archaeology and Biblical history at Trinity Southwest University, has been looking for the location of Sodom and Gomorrah for over five years. He has been quoted in the past as saying that he believes the discovery of the ancient Biblical cities would be compelling evidence that the historical information in Genesis is factual. (Map: eo.travelwithus.com)
"Such a discovery would be one of the most important Biblically-related archaeological finds in history," he said last year in a speech to Erskine College and Seminary.
Now, Collins believes he has found them. According to a report in Christianity Today, he was led to search for the cities in the opposite direction that other archaeologists were looking, based on his reading of Genesis 13.
"The Bible makes it very clear," Collins said, referring to Tall all-Hammam in Jordan, "Sodom is the largest Bronze Age city east of the Jordan River, north of the Dead Sea."
While critics are not in agreement with Collins yet, he is confident that ultimately proof will become evident. In response to critics of his research, Collins pointed out that very few biblical sites have been confirmed by inscriptional evidence of the kind that Cline calls compelling. Geographical information is equally important, he said. "We probably have more geography embedded in the text for Sodom than we do for just about any other city in the Old Testament."

I sat in the back of the speeding pickup surveying the desert in the direction the other hitchhiker was pointing. “There’s water in those mountains,” he said.
I wasn’t so sure. There wasn’t anything green as far as I could see. The truck was approaching a gas station where the guy wanted to be left off.

Description: A program designed to periodically check vehicle emissions to ensure they are within limits. Often referred to as an I/M (Inspection/Maintenance) program, they are used in numerous states and areas as required by the Environmental Protection Agency to improve air quality in those areas. Although the requirement comes from the federal government, states and their associated agencies have some flexibility in the type of test used, vehicle populations to be tested and other program-specific details. Some states run centralized programs that have state-contracted test stations exclusively dedicated to testing. Other states run decentralized programs, where emissions can be tested at local repair facilities. In a few cases, states may run "hybrid" programs using both centralized and decentralized test stations. The latest trend is to incorporate the use of second-generation onboard diagnostics (OBDII) into these programs, in many cases altogether eliminating the need for tailpipe emissions tests.
Purpose: I/M programs evaluate the emissions from vehicles and single out those that are polluting beyond the limits established for certain model years of vehicles. Aside from identifying vehicles with high emissions, such programs advocate proper maintenance to prevent high emissions due to maintenance neglect.
Maintenance Tips/Suggestions: The best way to keep your vehicle environmentally friendly is by performing regularly scheduled maintenance, rather than waiting to correct a problem after your car fails an emissions test. If the SERVICE ENGINE SOON or CHECK ENGINE light appears, have it checked out immediately by a professional technician. Neglecting these warning signs can cause lead to more extensive and expensive repairs.

I’d like to thank everyone for their interest in the Urushi Pearl Project, the first LE project between Edison and Hakumin Urushi Kobo. The project was a huge success and we have decided that we are going to continue this cooperative effort.
In fact, we are currently in the process of planning our next LE! We have decided that this next edition will be done on the Herald and we have some good ideas for the technique, which will be something different from the Pearl LE. While we are keeping the specific technique under wraps for now, we will say that the color scheme will be in the cooler side of the spectrum this time and that we will be using rhodium trim.
However, we are stuck on deciding one thing. Clip or no clip? A clip would add convenience and stop a pen from rolling away. Going clipless would emphasize an unbroken surface of the lacquer and show off the purity of the design. Which do we choose? Either way would be beautiful, and it ends up all being a matter of personal preference.
We have started a poll over at the Fountain Pen Network to put this up for a vote among our clients.
The furniture and nib are plated in ruthenium. The banner on the right side of the website might be a better photo of the nib.
Now that’s a stealthy pen I could fall in love with. Is it next week yet? :o) Beautiful looking pen Brian.
Yes, there will be two European distributors handling this pen. Stay tuned the middle of next week for the official announcement.
The ruthenium plating is just right. It would be nice if it were available in black ebonite as well as resin, and I hope the body diameter is at least 13 mm. Will there be a pneumatic version of the stealth in the future?
Black ebonite could always happen as a custom order if you like. But with the expense of ebonite, we could never do this at the same price that we are with acrylic.

With just five seats to their name countrywide, any wins for the People’s United Party will be counted a success for party leader John Briceño. But the P.U.P. believes they have a serious shot in the Old Capital, which last voted a P.U.P. City Council fifteen years ago, in 2003. To reverse the red tide, Briceño says the P.U.P. will be on the ground spreading its message of change. But Prime Minister Dean Barrow and Deputy Patrick Faber are just as sure that the United Democratic Party is on safe ground in its City strongholds, especially on the Southside. And the U.D.P. leaders say their focus is on retaining all of their seats and undercutting the P.U.P. in Briceño’s native Orange Walk.
“It’s a ground campaign. We cannot fight the U.D.P. with money; we are fighting them with love, with good ideas, great candidates, and hard work. We have been on the ground visiting every day. The U.D.P., they have not been doing that because they can’t visit the people; because that’s when the people attack them and tell them of the foolishness and the bad ideas, bad decisions that they have made. I believe we are going to do well in Belize City; I believe that Bernard stands a very good chance of being the next Mayor of Belize City – actually in my heart I believe he’s going to win. We believe that we’re going to win Belize City. At the end of the day it is the decision of the people of Belize City, but we are going to work hard, we are going to give it our all; we are going to show them the love and the appreciation that we have for them and we are going to point out to them that this City Council, Belize City our team is about the people, not about the projects.”
“In terms of the national campaign going into March seventh, what are we looking at in terms of the people giving the U.D.P. its vote?”
“I believe it will be countrywide, even Orange Walk we’re not giving up and I know that Minister Aragon and honorable Vega are pounding the pavement there because we’re not giving into any. We’re going to gun for all sixty-seven seats. I think the people of this country understand that we’re not a perfect entity but we are the best option and we are the viable option for Belize City, we’ve proven that and so they will give us their support once again in these municipal elections countrywide.”
“If you were to measure the temperature of the United Democratic Party going into March seventh, how would you rate it at this point?”
“It’s extremely high. There is, you see what’s happening behind us. All the talk about voter fatigue and disenchantment and disgruntlement, I am sure that there are some elements of validity to that kind of thinking but it cannot displace, it cannot overcome the fact of the outstanding track record that the United Democratic Party has in Belize City and indeed countrywide and that is what I think we’re seeing today and what I am certain we’ll see on March seventh.”
I've since updated my windows 10 to Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.228) as of yesterday and the issue still persists. Just thought I'd let you know that.
What I've noticed with Bandicut on Windows 10 Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.165) is it maximized when another app was opened like Firefox, Mirillis Action, TubeDigger or most other apps in the background.
However since the latest update of windows 10, apps opened or not, it crashes when trying to maximized or minimized.
I uninstalled Bandicut as you suggested and reinstalled it but the same thing happens all over again. I also restarted my PC and reinstalled Bandicut afresh but still getting the full screen crash.
If you need proof I'll replicate the uninstall and reinstall by recording it using Mirillis Action and posting it on YouTube.

Many people who love to write and sing songs also look for ways to connect with others. They want to share what is deep inside of them. This is a common experience for musical artists. Alex Pall is someone who has been part of the music scene for the last several years. During this time, he’s becoming increasingly determined to be seen not only as someone who makes music but also someone who can create art. He and his partner in music Andrew Taggart have taken the world of music by storm and crafted amazing soundscapes that have wide appeal. They are not content to stand still. The duo, known to the world as the Chainsmokers, look for ways to add a human element to all they do. Their goal is to take a form of music that is often seen as deeply impersonal and add a personal element to it. As two of the most recognized names in dance music, they are part of the music scene but also look at it from a different angle entirely.
Unlike some other contemporary artists who often choose to retreat from the public and from their fans, the same cannot be said of Alex Pall and Andrew Taggart. While they embrace success, they want something more. The duo aims to be seen as people and artists instead of a faceless force grinding out beat after beat. Each time they write a song, they aim to think about ways they can help reveal more of themselves to those who love what they do. They want to weave a sense of intimacy into their chosen genre and help bring in a sense of enormous connection to their art. It’s not enough to have a series of hits. They want to have an identity. Their ultimate goal is to look for ways they can use their music as a source of evolution in their lives and the lives of their many global fans. As their audience grows, they also hope to see continued musical growth and true personal growth.
City got off to a poor start to the season against a stronger than usual Falkirk side - Falkirk have attracted a few new players over the winter which has allowed their lower teams to be a bit stronger.
The first 15 minutes - City had the ball for the majority of it - but lost 2 very soft breakaway goals - one through bad marking and one a sloppy pass. And just on 15 minutes a miscommunication saw early subbing start with players moving out of position and costing City a 3rd goal through a short corner. City
City in the second half of the first half performed better defensively but didnt threaten much going forward.
Into the second half City were by far the better team but were failing to convert a number of short corner chances.
City eventually got a goal back when Miller beat his man down the right wing - played an enticing ball across the D which found Cunniffe - the ball eventually broke to Spreng whose shot was blocked by a foot on route to the goal. A penalty was awared which Spreng converted.
City then finally converted a short corner - although it looked to have broken down. As the balls was cleared following a shot at goal - Miller controlled the high ball before blasting the ball home.
We need to start better as a team - we played some good hockey early on but probably committed too many players forward. Disorganisation with subbing at a bad time also cost us a goal. If we perform like we did in the second half however we should start putting some positive results together.

A Brief Welcome to All our Admissions.Please get yourself sorted and complete your wand tests before you start taking classes
Booking your stay online is often an easy and hassle-free process. Some travellers, however, seem to think that they have a greater negotiating power and seek additional freebies. Booking a hotel stay online has its own advantages. The deals and discounts that a discerning traveller can get on a booking website will more than make up for the freebies.
Plan ahead and wait for deals – Planning a vacation well ahead of time provides you one great advantage. You have the time to wait for deals on online hotel booking. Most hotels and travel websites offer seasonal deals and these could be quite a steal. You may also be able to avail of packages that include airport transfer, meals, and spa coupons in such deals.
Compare prices on different websites – Before booking your stay always compare prices on different websites. The tariff for a Garden View Suite at The LaLiT Golf & Spa Resort Goa, for example, may vary considerably on different hotel booking websites. It is also possible that the hotel’s own website may be offering a discount on bookings. It is important to do your own comparison and not depend on web engines.
Read the cancellation policy – Before booking your stay online, it is important to comb through the cancellation policy. Quite often hotels and booking websites allow visitors to cancel without a cancellation fee if the stay is still about 3 weeks later. The closer you cancel to your stay date, the more cancellation fee you may have to pay.
Last minute booking may help – Generally visitors avoid booking at the last minute for fear that tariff hikes are imminent. Last minute bookings, however, place you at an advantage. When hotel occupancy is low, online tariff is often slashed. This discounted fare may not apply to those booking in person. Another advantage is that last minute booking may open up a free upgrade deal on the website.
Look for hotel stars, not website ratings – There are certain things that you will need to carefully look through before booking your hotel stay online. The ratings of the hotel, usually denoted by number of stars, may not be indicative of the star of the hotel. This means that a four-star hotel may have 3 stars against its name on a booking website and this will merely denote the rating given by users to that hotel. This is a difference you must look out for.
Read user reviews, not just descriptions – Hotel descriptions and pictures are very useful when it comes to understanding the services and amenities on offer. These also give us an idea about the views and the location of the hotel. The actual service, hygiene, quality of food, etc. may, however, be better revealed by the reviews of guests who have stayed there.
Look for convenient check-in slots – Travelers booking through websites often do not find an option for late check-in. Any delay in check-in could cause you to lose your booking. Fortunately, there is a convenient fix for this problem. Once you have a confirmed booking, call the hotel and ask them to keep your room ready for a late arrival. Hotels are often glad to comply with this or any other requests (such as dietary restrictions) when informed in advance.
Flexibility in payment options – Many hotels offer a number of payment options particularly when it comes to online bookings. One of the greatest advantages of booking through a website is that it also offers coupons that can be redeemed against future bookings. Look for conversion of credit card points or add to your frequent flyers points when booking through the website.

Here's the official description of the game, straight from Nintendo: "Game Freak, the developer of the Pokemon series, has created a new RPG for Nintendo Switch".
Video game stories from other sites on the web. The entire game is said to be set within this one town, with what looks to be a turn-based battle system. At times, you will need to utilize the terrain, buildings, and the help of fellow villagers in order to defeat the invaders. There is a trailer for the game which you can see below, but other than that, we'll have to wait until Nintendo or GameFreak have more info.
Besides TOWN and countless Pokémon titles, Game Freak has also developed such games as Tembo the Badass Elephant, Pocket Card Jockey, HarmoKnight, and Drill Dozer.
But quite disappointingly, a leak suggests that the rumored Razer Phone 2 will look a lot like the phone it is succeeding.
We're hoping Town lives up to Game Freak's pedigree, and are looking forward to learning more about the game in the future.
Game Freak has based Town on creatures that are antagonistic in nature, therefore, serving as a threat to you as a player and your village.

Good nutrition is really essential to health. Sadly, most people fall for false advertising or simply do not understand what they are really eating and get tricked into thinking they are consuming healthy foods. Just knowing what is good to eat will not help you if you do not use that information. Follow these simple steps to better nutrition, and you can be sure you are on the right track.
Try to fit as many fresh vegetables in your diet as possible. Instead of having mashed potatoes with dinner, have fresh asparagus or green beans. Fresh vegetables taste better than frozen or canned, and have more of the nutrients your body requires. They are also more filling, which means you are less likely to eat more fatty foods.
Watch how you prepare your food and see if you can do better. If you are one for frying in oils and fats constantly, you can cook much healthier. Try steaming, baking, broiling and grilling. This will also help to avoid depleting the essential nutrients in your food.
Try to have protein from many distinct sources within each week. best foods to increase collagen production on fish, lean meats and skinless poultry. Eggs make a wonderful source of protein in moderation. Studies have shown that a single egg eaten daily does no harm. Try refraining from eating meat one day out of every seven. Good meat substitutes include seeds, peanut butter, peas, seeds and nuts.
Help to ensure that your children are getting the proper nutrition they need on a daily basis by packing healthy lunches for them to take to school. When making sandwiches, avoid high-fat deli meats, such as ham, bologna and salami, and opt for low-fat turkey, chicken or even lean roast beef. Use whole grain bread and light mayonnaise. Egg salad, tuna fish and an occasional peanut butter and jelly sandwich provide some variety. While fresh fruit is convenient and nutritional, switch up the usual apples, oranges and bananas from time to time with dried fruit mixes, granola bars, nuts, yogurt, or carrot and celery sticks with a low-fat dip. Water, low-fat or skim milk, 100% fruit juices and low-sodium vegetable juice all make healthy beverage choices. You can even surprise your children now and again with a homemade chocolate chip cookie for dessert!
To increase your ability to concentrate, add plenty of iron to your diet. Iron helps your body to distribute oxygen, and not consuming enough of it can make it very hard to think clearly. Soybeans, lentils, and spinach are among the world's most iron rich foods. Other good sources of this nutrient are kidney beans and venison.
You might be drinking soy milk to make sure you're getting the calcium you need. But you must shake it each time you pour a glass in order to be sure you benefit from the calcium it contains. The calcium in soy milk slowly settles to the bottom of the carton, so if you don't shake it each time, it won't end up in your glass.
Collagen Supplements: Do They Actually Work? - Sporteluxe Collagen came onto my radar after a naturopath recommended I add it to my smoothies to assist in healing my skin after hormonal, stress-related breakouts and recurrent infections had rendered it a minefield. It was red, it was bumpy, it was sore. I immediately scoured the internet for a high-quality supplement that I could incorporate into smoothies or broths as a skin-healing aid.
Make sure to eat fruits and vegetables with your meals and throughout the day. By eating these you will be able to eat healthy snacks and also eat fewer high calorie foods during your meals. You will be able to easily lower the amount of calories you take in each day.
Many people love a good sandwich. That is fine unless they put mayonnaise on it. All mayonnaise contains is fat that will hinder the weight loss process. Try using mustard instead. Mustard packs a lot of flavor and has zero calories in it. You will still love your sandwich and it won't contain so many calories.
You can boost your chance for conception with some super foods like oysters, yams and berries. Oysters are a concentrated source of the zinc, which is important for conception. Research has suggested that yams may stimulate ovulation. Berries contain antioxidants, which can protect the body from cell damage, including the cells in your reproductive system.
Try to keep your snacks prepared and in a spot that you can easily get to them. When you buy your snacks, such as fruits and vegetables, cut them up and store them in containers. This will give your snack the convenience of a prepackaged snack. Instead of grabbing for a quick bag of chips, you will already have quick fruits and veggies on hand.
This system will keep you from giving up and going for something fast but unhealthy. The variety in the meals that you can choose will prevent you from experiencing boredom.
Unless you are diabetic, avoid eating two to three hours before you go to bed. Do something to take your mind off food like putting away leftovers, washing the dishes, or cleaning your teeth. Finish what is collagen used for in wounds with a nice cup of herbal tea. This will help you to relax and get to sleep.
A great nutrition tip is to opt for white meat when you're eating chicken or turkey. Although dark meat may taste good, it is much higher in fat. White meat is leaner and much healthier for you. Stay away from the thighs as well and stick with the breast.
When eating salad at a restaurant, always ask for the dressing in a little cup, not directly on your salad. This way you can know exactly how much you use, and you won't load up on empty calories. This will prevent you from eating too much salad dressing without realizing it.
It can be easy to think you are eating well when you are not. The results of bad eating habits are cumulative. These tips will help you prevent this. Utilize the tips here to help you figure out what are the best ways to eat more nutritious foods.

Hey there! Name's Cassio. I recently came across the game and even after just a few minutes it piqued my interest. Anyway, I always like to introduce myself before anything else, so here I am.
I'm quite shy really, I do find it difficult to start up conversations in-game due to fear of rejection and whatnot, so that's another reason why I'm doing this. I'd love to get to know the players and learn about the game. I've decided on holding back on fully developing my character until I get more into it, but I do have years of experience in roleplay and I do enjoy setting characters up. Anyway, I don't know what else to say, but I look forward to getting to know you all and I'm sorry if I ever seem weird, ignorant or distant in game, it's just in my nature until I come out of my shell.
Oh, one other thing though, I'm a British Roleplayer but I have a weird sleeping pattern and could be on at any time whatsoever. That said, I don't always have access to a machine that can run BYOND. (I have the computer I'm on now, but I don't have access to it all the time and I have a laptop which is near enough trash and struggles with a few tabs on firefox.)
I am an absolute fan of Era of the Shinobi. I enjoy the art style, the RP structure and I admire the work of the staff. However, I sincerely must confess myself as not really being a fan of the community (with which I grow many tensions and quarrels). Despite of it, the ideas I present in this topic are in no manner related to my personal feelings regarding the playerbase, being a mere product of a personal initiative to improve mine and other's experience in Era of the Shinobi.
First, we must adress what are the current traits of the mission system so that we make a rational conclusion about which changes should be taken:
- It requires small effort or specially creative strategies from players to execute missions in general.
- Village Authorities have no necessity at all to give missions to player squads. It's a process that requires time, it's mostly mechanized and not entertaining. It's a mere burden for the village authorities, which will tend to priorize other actions, such as their own training, wars, etc. The result of this is that villages (Not mentioning names) may spend even a week without the players receiving missions (which is of course, very important for progression and acquiring funds). Even if "negligent" village authorities were punished for acting in such manner, the problem could simply continue due to the position of unecessary burden that the mission system is for the village in general.
- The missions tend to be mostly the same, be roleplayed the same and not ever having any sort of special traits going on for them. Per example, gathering pestulent weed away form the crops: Wouldn't it be more rational to search for the source of the pestulent weed instead of collecting it everyday?
- The mission system works in a separate layer from the whole village interface. Which reinforces the phenomenon explained in the item 1. 180x = 4000
- First thing that has to be done is to relate Village Assets (which are used generally for war and other actions. They consist on: Money, Elemental Affinity Tests, Tournament Prizes and more) and the actual mission system, giving an incentive for village authorities to at least give away missions. My suggestion for this topic is:
* For each mission reported accomplished to the admins (which according to the progression guide are made "aware of"), the village authorities receive 4x (Or 6x or 8x) the total payment they gave the 3 or 4 men squad that took on accomplishing it and have their jounins earn the right to "make" elemental affinity papers with a quantity equal to the number of shinobi that took on the mission. That manner, for every ninja to have the right for receiving an elemental affinity paper, they'd just have to execute a mission for the village. Which would, of course, solve also one of the problems existing in the game between admins and "council members" regarding to lack of objective regulation related to Affinity Tests given by Village Authorities.
*Have a limit payment for each given mission according to their ranks, multiplying it by 3x or 2,5x for every increased rank.
(These multipliers were deduced after taking the average mission reward for a D rank to be 20 Ryos and the Bounty Reward for a dead demon being 4000 Ryos. By utilizing those numbers, you can also aim at reducing the current monetary gap existing in the game, where bounties have out of the charts rewards and missions tend to have small ones. For them to be changed, I'd suggest dividing the current bounty rewards by 2. By the current standard, it'd take around 22 D Rank missions (Executed by 3 men squads) for a village to earn the equivalent to a slayed demon bounty)
- After reading Number 1, it becomes evident that a problem appears: what if village authorities merely gave missions (which frankly, would already be a huge improvement from the original system!) desiring it to end as fast and simple as possible so they could earn their village assets, which would of course compromise RP quality? There is a simple manner to reduce that issue that can also open a huge area of possibilities for the game itself to be improved: Mission Storylines.
* Every Storyline would consist in a 3 to 4 executions of the same mission scroll (such as "Weed Picking") which would require players and village authorities to actually make a coherent and dynamic side-story related to each executed mission in that scroll during a Storyline and Admins would also have to be made aware of (such as they are about missions) when those are finished. Per example:
In the first execution of the scroll "Pestulent Weed Picking", It'd be OOC required by the editor village authority to also include a paragraph REQUIRING for the players to also investigate the source of the problem threatening the crops besides only cleaning it - which would certainly require time and thought from the roleplayers, delaying any possible mission spam to build up village assets by the authorities and rewarding specially creative players (since those could make interesting stories faster). After that mission scroll is first retrieved with the collecting/investigation accomplished, the squad would also report to the village authority that they've discovered giant feces in the middle of the crops, which seem to be enriching the soil specially for the pestulent weed to grow; information that'd be Icly written into the scroll as a "Camp Report". In the second time the scroll would be given, it'd be required OOC for the same or a different team to clean the crops and aswell as searching for any possible animal that had been "spreading" his feces around the crops, which they'd roleplay finding out it is a giant boar, reporting the discovery as a "Camp Report" for the mission scroll and having the village authority OOCly preparing the scroll for a next team that'd receive such scroll to actually "get rid of the giant boar", either killing it or just making it go away far from the village (there are other possibilities, though). After that conclusion third mission has been accomplished, the village could report that a Storyline was finished, which would give them 1500 Ryos (For a D Rank Storyline finished) to 15000 (For a S Rank, multiplying the reward by 2 for each increased rank in the storyline). After that, the scroll could either be changed to something completely different, such as "Animal Plagues Removel, Coast Cleanse, etc" or just re-start itself as a Weed Picking storyline, however, ending in a completely different outcome.
*This system opens more possibilities for RP in Progress Logs (which take missions as a serious deal), serves as a possibility to stop villages from spamming bad quality accomplished missions and mostly, creates a Mission/Storyline Accomplished Ratio, which could never be that different from 1/3 or 1/4, making it easier for Admins to regulate and stop malicious actions from village authorities and the overall lazyness of the player base.
Reminder: I'm still taking the 20 Ryos-6000 Ryos as the monetary standard of the game. Those reward values could be changed as the admins see fit.
*Also, a daily limit for accomplished missions by villages could also be implemented to stop spamming or just having more crowded villages becoming vastly wealthier than less crowdy ones, if the Admins consider it fit. Frankly, it's still far from our reality where missions are generally scarce, so I avoided commenting about it.
My system serves as a suggestion for not only creating a reason for Village Authorities to give missions to their shinobi aswell as connecting the actual amount of mission RP to the wealth/power capacity of a village, which is a reality in Naruto. I'd really love to have my suggestion commented, at least to know that I've not wasted my time as a no-lifer trying to have my nerdy afternoons cleaned of AFK people and OOC discussions. If at least the first proposition was implemented, I'd already be happy. However, I know you guys have other things to do.
- What is a village already gathered enough assets to do not need to go on missions for a long period of time? Creating a "Boom" and "Bust" cycle in the mission system? (As I proved before, it'd be necessary to accomplish at least 22 D Rank Missions accomplished by 3 men squads for a Village to earn the amount of money equivalent to the bounty of a demon, WITHOUT counting with storyline rewards. Which is already an evolution from the current standard (where missions have no incentive to be given away). However, I must confirm that this is a solid objection to the plan, that although serves as an improvement, may not solve the problems with the mission system in the long term. So, how could the problem be handled in the long term?)
*As I said before, the Naruto manga establishes a direct relation between missions and a village's power, such as seem in the Konoha's Invasion Arc in the late parts of the Chunnin Shiken, when the fact that clients in the Wind Nation were giving missions to Konoha instead of Suna was a major issue for the village's authority and power. In our cases, since village assets = missions = RP with cohesive storylines, the only possible solution for the system to do not fall into cycles (which although bad, is still better than the current system) would be with the actual implementation of more village asset to be Icly bought by villages or just a 2-weeks payment necessary for the maintenance of the village infraestructure that'd be given by the admins. I suggest it to be a minimum of 3000 Ryos so it can keep the accounting standard of the Bounty - D Rank Reward. For that to be paid, a village would have to at least hand the minimum of 11 D rank missions to 3 men squads, which would as a maximum benefit 33 players; a small number that however compromises all the major villages' actual active and capable roleplayerbase.
*It is more close to the base material because it actually attempts at connecting the mission execution with the actual wealth of a village. And throug
*It promotes creative RP through the Storyline system in order to protect the system from spamming aswell. And through the wealth-mission-storylines-RP relation, creates a direct connection between the amount of RP invested into world interaction with the actual wealth of a village.
*Creates a long term issue due to mission cycles. Which although an improvement from the actual problem, it's still an issue if not fought against with regular half-monthly Ryo payments from the Kages.
*Requires a few more work from the admins (since they'd have to not only be made aware of missions accomplished as they currently are) because they'd have to properly reward the villages with Ryos for the storyline/missions accomplished and after two weeks, require a regular payment for infraestructure from the village authorities in general. For this issue to be radically diminished, there are solutions aswell that do not compete to be explained in this topic, however;

Smith C. J. Prosise Jersey , who retired after the 2016 season and now works as an analyst for the NFL Network, told NFL that despite making five Pro Bowls and being selected All-Pro twice he "routinely felt trapped, inferior and alone" and often asked himself "what's wrong with me?"
The 39-year-old Smith said by his final season with Carolina in 2013 he was so overwhelmed he didn't know how to handle his emotions and "was a cynic of everything and everyone."
Smith says he's been receiving treatment for depression and advised others to do the same, saying "stop trying to deal with these serious matters alone."
The Buccaneers were last in the league in sacks and passing yards allowed last year Brandon Carr Jersey , so it stands to reason that they spent most of their offseason capital on that side of the ball.
“It’s got to be a hell of a lot better than what we put out there last year,” Smith said, via Greg Auman of the Tampa Bay Times. “I’ve said it many times. The numbers are not anywhere close to what we’ve got to do. We’ve got to be more consistent in everything we do, and it starts in the meeting rooms Jake Matthews Jersey , in building trust with one another across the board. That’s the most important thing.”
The Bucs traded for defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul, signed linemen Vinny Curry, Beau Allen Aaron Jones Jersey , and Mitch Unrein in free agency, and then used three of their first four draft picks on defense.,
With first-rounder Vita Vea bolstering what could be a solid front (for new line coach Brentson Buckner to work with), the Bucs could make big improvements this year. That’s also easier because it would be hard to be worse. (Narrator: It can always get worse.)

Deltiology (from Greek δελτίον, deltion, diminuitive of δέλτος, deltos, "tablet, letter"; and -λογία, -logia) is the study and collection of postcards. Compared to philately, the iden- tification of a postcard's place and time of production can often be an impossible task because postcards, unlike stamps, are produced in a decentralised, unregulated manner. For this reason, some collectors choose to limit their acquisitions to cards by specific artists and publishers, or by time and location.
Pannonhalma is a small town in western Hungary, in Győr-Moson-Sopron county with approx. 4.000 inhabitants. It is about 20 km from Győr; it is accessible by car, bus or train.
The town, known as Győrszentmárton until 1965, is dominated by its most famous landmarks: the thousand-year-old Pannonhalma Archabbey and the Benedictine Secondary School, which are situated above the village, on Szent Marton Hill. The hill itself is still known by this ancient name and the name "Pannonhalma" was introduced as part of the Hungarian language reforms in the nineteenth century. The association with Saint Martin ("Szent Márton" in Hungarian) derives from a belief that Martin of Tours was born here, though others believe he was born in nearby Szombathely.
There is a small statue in the town at the crossroads under the abbey which shows the saint as a Roman soldier, cutting his cloak according to the legend associated with him. The wall behind this is part of the original fortifications which were built in 1569 as a result of incursions into Western Hungary by the Ottoman Turks. The area remained a moving frontier between the Islamic Ottoman empire and the Christian west for the following 140 years and the town suffered considerable damage during this time.
From at least the nineteenth century, Szent Marton had a significant Jewish community. They played an important role in the commerce of village, as it was then, until the latter years of World War II. In 1944 the remaining Jewish families were rounded up and sent to extermination camps. A small synagogue, built in the late 1800´s, remains on the main street, though it is no longer in use. The building is in the process of being restored and a monument has been constructed on the street in front of it. Some dozens of Jews were protected in the abbey when it was taken under control of the International Red Cross in October 1944, along with 3.000 other refugees, many of them children, thanks to the efforts of a Swiss national, Eduard Benedek Brunschweiler. The IRC was expelled from Pannonhalma by the Red Army in April 1945.
In 1996 parts of the town were included in UNESCO's demarcation of the Abbey as a World Heritage Site. Four years later, the village of Pannonhalma was officially granted "town" status.

The asylum section of the Immigration and Nationality Act says a migrant is allowed to make a claim up to a year after arriving in the USA, and it doesn't matter how they arrive - illegally or through a border crossing.
The interim final rule to limit asylum proposed on November 8, 2018, by the Trump Administration is the latest attempt to shut American doors to people fleeing persecution and violence, Human Rights Watch said today.
The new rule comes as a so-called caravan of migrants from Central America travels north by foot through Mexico to the USA border.
The move would largely affect migrants from Central America's Northern Triangle - Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador - who cross the USA border with Mexico to flee violence and poverty in their home countries.
"US law is crystal clear that asylum seekers have the right to lodge asylum claims regardless of where they enter the country, and President Trump can not change the law on a whim", said Bill Frelick, Refugee Rights director at Human Rights Watch.
The administration's plan, which invokes the same authority Trump used to justify his travel ban on citizens of several Muslim-majority nations, is likely to be quickly challenged in court. "It is illegal to circumvent that by agency or presidential decree", Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, responded in in a statement.
The Republican Party retained the control of the US Senate as the vote count for the US Midterm Elections 2018 continued. Democratic favorite Conor Lamb, who stunned Washington by winning a special election in the state, beat Republican Rep.
"The vast majority of these applications eventually turn out to be non-meritorious", a senior administration official said, asking not to be identified.
The busy ports of entry already had long lines and waits, forcing immigration officials to tell some migrants to come back to make their claims.
This summer, multiple news outlets reported that hundreds of migrants who had legally presented themselves to USA agents at official ports of entry, like San Ysidro, California and El Paso, Texas, were told that their asylum requests could not be processed.
In 2018, border patrols have registered more than 400,000 illegal border crossers, homeland security said.
Administration officials argue the asylum system is abused by people who are not seeking security in the US but are instead searching for economic opportunity or trying to reunite with family members.

By the early 1990s, his work on films such as Throw Momma from the Train and War of the Roses began to bring respect to Danny DeVito as a director. With 1992’s Hoffa, he branched out from his prior comedic work and went with an epic look at controversial union leader Jimmy Hoffa.
After a quick opening in 1975 – the year when Hoffa (Jack Nicholson) mysteriously disappeared – we view events through flashbacks. These begin in 1935 with the first time Hoffa met Bobby Ciaro (DeVito), a driver who would eventually become Hoffa’s friend and right-hand man. (Ciaro didn’t exist; the character comes as an amalgam of other real-life people.)
Hoffa sells Ciaro on the Teamsters, a major union. Initially, Ciaro resists Hoffa’s pitch, but he eventually comes around and joins the cause. The film follows Hoffa’s life and career, with plenty of controversies along the way.
When Hoffa hit screens at the end of 1992, it seemed like a film likely to garner ample Oscar attention. However, it only received two nominations; these came for cinematography and for makeup. How was it possible that an “A”-list epic biopic written by David Mamet and starring Jack Nicholson could get essentially snubbed by the Academy?
I suppose it’s because Hoffa just isn’t an especially good movie. DeVito probably stands as the film’s biggest problem, essentially because he bites off more than he can chew. DeVito appears so eager to stake his claim as a Big-Time Director that he succumbs to pretension.
This means that DeVito imbues Hoffa with a lot of self-conscious attempts to seem “epic”. DeVito utilizes many showy filmmaking techniques, few of which feel natural and organic. For instance, one sequence delivers a slow zoom on a priest’s ear that then cuts to a close-up of DeVito’s mouth. I guess the director thought this would look smooth and “arty”, but it just comes across as pointless and showy.
Because of these elements, Hoffa occasionally feels like a parody of an epic biopic. DeVito works so hard to impress us that the opposite occurs and we become distracted by his lack of cinematic restraint.
It doesn’t help that the story tends to plod. The flashback structure becomes a nuisance – we know it’ll lead to Hoffa’s still-unsolved disappearance – and events don’t progress in a particularly dynamic manner. We traipse along as Hoffa works his way up in the ranks and deals with various issues, but little real drama occurs. No matter how hard DeVito tries, the tale remains flat and uninspiring.
Maybe I shouldn’t blame this on DeVito, as some of the problems may reside with Mamet’s script. However, I think the buck ultimately lies with the director; he’s the one who needs to fix any screenplay problems. I have so little confidence in DeVito’s abilities that I wonder if he actually harmed Mamet’s work; I have more faith in Mamet than I do DeVito, so I can’t help but consider the notion that the director undercut what might’ve been a good foundation.
Or maybe the whole thing’s a dud from all sides. Nicholson didn’t get an Oscar nod as Hoffa, but he did receive a Razzie nomination. I don’t think Nicholson deserved that level of insult, but that doesn’t mean I feel positively about his performance. Nicholson tends toward caricature as Hoffa; buried underneath a mountain of makeup, he turns the union leader into a cartoon tough guy without much else involved.
All of this is a shame, as I suspect a good film could look at the life of Jimmy Hoffa. Unfortunately, this isn’t that film. Hoffa isn’t a total dud, but it’s mediocre at best and never captures the viewer’s interest, even though it tries really, really hard.
Hoffa appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 2.35:1 on this Blu-Ray Disc. This was a pretty strong presentation.
For the most part, sharpness seemed positive. A few interiors looked a bit soft, but those were exceptions to the rule. The vast majority of the elements came across as concise and well-defined. Jaggies and moiré effects failed to materialize, and I noticed no edge haloes. With a nice, natural layer of grain, heavy-handed digital noise reduction didn’t appear to occur, and the image lacked spots, marks or other print defects.
In terms of colors, the film opted for a subdued palette. That came as no surprise, for period films usually follow that path. Overall color reproduction remained fine; despite the mildly muted sensibility, the hues remained pretty full and vivid.
Blacks showed nice depth and intensity, and I thought low-light shots appeared clear and well-defined. Only the smattering of soft spots made this a “B+” transfer, as most of the flick merited “A”-level consideration.
I also felt pleased with the satisfying DTS-HD MA 5.1 soundtrack of Hoffa. Given the narrative, I expected a low-key soundscape, but the mix managed to open up pretty consistently. Shots with vehicles allowed them to move smoothly around the room, and more action-oriented pieces – like explosions or gunfire – delivered impressive material. All these elements melded together smoothly and created a nice, five-channel setting.
Audio quality was a little dated but still positive. Speech occasionally seemed a little brittle, but the lines were always intelligible and usually natural. Music sounded bold and bright, while effects showed nice clarity and accuracy; only a smidgen of distortion ever marred the piece. This was a solid “B+” mix.
Part of Fox’s “Filmmakers Signature Series”, the disc opens with an Introduction from director/actor Danny DeVito. He pops out of the opening Fox logo to provide an overview of the disc. It’s an insubstantial but fun way to begin.
DeVito reappears to give us an audio commentary. He delivers a running, screen-specific look at sets and locations, makeup and effects, cast and performances, story/character subjects, production design, costumes and period details, cinematography and editing, historical elements, and a few other areas.
From start to finish, DeVito provides an engaging look at the film. He covers a good selection of subjects and does so in a satisfying manner. The director helps make this a likable, informative chat.
Entitled The Music of Hoffa, a featurette runs 10 minutes, 31 seconds and features a chat between DeVito and composer David Newman. They sit together and discuss the movie’s score and related elements. The pair connect well and give us a nice overview of the music.
For something unusual, we get Danny DeVito’s Speech at the 2011 Teamsters Convention. This goes for 15 minutes, 16 seconds and offers DeVito’s address about unions and how much he loves them and values them. DeVito adds enough humor to his speech to make this more than just a curiosity.
Three Excised Scenes occupy a total of five minutes, 18 seconds. In these, we see a Hoffa news conference, a shooting expedition followed by a dinner to celebrate Hoffa’s upward progress, and a montage of silent elements that I suspect was meant to cap the film. The second clip has some interesting bits but none of the three adds anything substantial.
Next we find Historical News Coverage of Hoffa. This section fills seven minutes, 54 seconds and shows the real Jimmy Hoffa at the hearing conducted by Robert Kennedy. This becomes one of the disc’s best extras, as it gives us a great look at the actual people behind the movie.
Under Personal Anecdotes from Members of the Teamsters Union, we get a six-minute, 36-second piece that features Larry Brennan, Robert Holmes, Robie Smith, Robert Lins, Jimmy Yardley, Al Klingman, William “Crash” Taylor, and Charles Lester. DeVito conducted the interviews back during the period of the movie’s creation, and we get stories about Hoffa. These tend to be laudatory, but we still find some decent information.
Within a section called Special Shots, we see a 14-minute, 13-second collection of shots from the set. DeVito narrates as we view the footage, and text tells us where to find the finished sequences in the movie. DeVito delivers some useful notes and we check out some good behind the scenes material.
What in the world is DeVito’s 11 ¼? The 11-minute, two-second piece shows us more footage from the shoot. These pieces tend toward the more fun/silly side; it’s not blooper reel material, but it’s lighter than usual. I never figured out what the collection’s title means, though.
We look at the film’s critical reception via a 1992 Siskel and Ebert Segment. It lasts four minutes, 28 seconds and lets us hear what the noted critics thought of Hoffa. Both liked it, so don’t expect much criticism here.
Behind the scenes material shows up under Discussion After First Script Read-Through. This reel fills three minutes, 34 seconds and lets us hear audio recording of the cast’s chat about the screenplay. It’s a fun reel that gives us some good insights.
In addition to the film’s Trailer, we locate some still materials. A Production Gallery shows 106 photos; it mixes shots from the set and movie images. It’s a nice collection, and I like the fact that it follows the production in the order of the story’s events.
We also get a Shooting Script for Hoffa. This covers the entire original screenplay, so we find deleted scenes in addition to those that made the final film. The format can be awkward – it uses 378 frames and lacks any kind of indexing – but it’s still cool to see the whole screenplay.
Finally, the package includes a 28-page Booklet. It offers some production notes as well as cast/crew biographies. DVD/Blu-ray booklets are a dying breed, so it’s nice to find one here – especially when the booklet is as high-quality as this one.
Back in 1992, Hoffa looked like a sure-fire critical hit. Instead, it got mixed reviews and failed to attract an audience. I suspect this occurred because Hoffa offers an overly eager epic, a film that wants desperately to impress the viewer but that lacks much substance. The Blu-ray delivers very good picture and audio along with a nice collection of bonus features. Hoffa remains a disappointment as a film, but the Blu-ray stands tall as a fine release.
